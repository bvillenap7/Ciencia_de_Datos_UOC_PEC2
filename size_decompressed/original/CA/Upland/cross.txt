Possible UFO Sighting;2012-07-28 21:10:00;5 minutes;Possible UFO Sighting Dear Mr. Davenport,   I stayed up last night with my husband until about 1:00 AM discussing what we saw as he put together his sighting report that he submitted last night.   Since we collaborated on what we saw as the report that was submitted was prepared of course I agree with its contents. My husband prepared the above.  However I have read it and am submitting this as a second observer report.;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679

These were not airplanes or jets. Possible UFO Sighting:  What the ships looked like.  This is the best I can Illustrate with excel. (Note that the pictures that I have prepared did not paste along with the words but I want to report this now in case anybody else in the area where I live has seen the same thing. Somebody else must have been outside.)            The ships had extremely bright illumination.  Bright red in the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps with bright white on the inside. I know the shape because we graphed these in calculus. First seen by wife.  She was taking the trash out, leaving the front door, which faces north, when she saw the bright lights.  She watched this for about  2 minutes then ran to the back yard, where I was at the time, to tell me to look.  She stood out front for a while before coming to get me because she wanted to see what these weird things are.  She thought we were in danger.  Because of the formation of the flying ships my wife thought that maybe it was some military planes that may be coming to bomb us.  My wife was scared. (This drawing, that did not paste, illustrates 3 ships with bright red on the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps and bright white light on the inside)    Seen by me and my wife in the back yard. We watched these for about 20 to 30 seconds. My wife ran in the house to get a camera. The ships were at about a 30 degree angle from a level line. Note that the red and white illuminations of the ships were very bright, not like a normal airplane or any jets I have ever seen. (This drawing, that did not paste, illustrates 4 ships with bright red in the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps and bright white light on the inside)    Seen by me while my wife is getting the camera. Fourth unit came as soon as my wife went in the house. This flying vehicle came from the atmosphere, not from the horizon like a typical plane would come. The ships were at about a 40 degree angle with a level line at this time. and the lights were getting brighter as if they were coming closer to our location. (This drawing, that did not paste, illustrates 5 ships with bright red in the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps and bright white light on the inside)    Seen by me and my wife. The fifth ship came from the atmosphere while my wife was getting the camera. Basically, it looked like the flying ship came from space. The ships were at about a 50 degree angle with a level line. The lights were brighter as if they were closer to our location. We watched this for about 20 to 30 seconds. Note: My wife was in a hurry to grab her camera, the fourth and fifth flying ship arrived in about 10 to 20 seconds. Once again not from the horizon, but from the atmosphere/space. (This drawing, that did not paste, illustrates 5 ships with bright red in the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps and bright white light on the inside. The ships are now much closer together then before)   Seen by me and my wife. The ships seemed to group together. They were at about a 50 degree angle with a level line and were very bright. (This drawing, that did not paste, illustrates 5 ships with bright red in the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps and bright white light on the inside. The ships are close together as stated above, the two ships on the right each have an arrow pointing about north 15 degree east)     Seen by me and  my wife. The ships on the right hand side left. They were gone in about 3 to 5 seconds. Note that the ships left by going away from where we were standing towards space, not on a path of the horizon, like how a typical plane would fly. Also note that there was no noise as they flew away. If these were jets then I feel confident that we would have heard them. (This drawing, that did not paste, illustrates 3 ships with bright red in the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps and bright white light on the inside. The ships are close ogether as stated above, the two ships on the right each have an arrow pointing about north 15 degree east)   Seen by me and my wife. Two more ships leave. These ship were also gone in about 3 to 5 seconds. Note that the ships left by going away from where we were standing towards space, not on a path of the horizon, like how a typical plane would fly. There was no noise when these ships left. (This drawing, that did not paste, illustrates 1 ship remaining with bright red in the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps and bright white light on the inside. The ships has an arrow pointing about north 15 degree east)     Seen by me and my wife. The last ship flies away. This ship was also gone in about 3 to 5 seconds. Note that the ship left by going away from where we were standing towards space, not on a path of the horizon, like how a typical plane would fly. There was no noise when this ship left. The viewing in the back yard all took place in about a 3 minute period. This happened on the night of 7/29/12 at about 9:10 PM in Upland, California at our home. Our home is located northeast of Mountain Avenue and 21st Street.  I called the upland police at about 9:20 PM to ask them if anybody else has called in reporting some UFOâ€™s. The lady that answered the phone said that no one had called her about this topic.  She gave ma a phone number to call to report this type of activity but it was a wrong number. I called the National UFO Reporting Center at *82 1 (206) 722-3000 at about 9:30 PM and talked to Peter Davenport. Mr. Davenport asked be to briefly explain what I have seen.  He did not want to tell me about other peoples reports and he then told me to write a report.  He said he would talk to me more after sending in a report.  He said he did not want to taint my report by talking about what other people have reported. Note I took a picture. The flash was on the camera and did not pick up a useful illustration. By the time I tried to take another picture the ships were gone. Flying ships very bright, no noise, did not fly along the horizon. Vehicles came and left from the atmosphere/space. This drawing, which did not paste, depicts that the azimuth of the ships were about north 15 degrees east of the intersection of Mountain and 21st Street in the City of Upland California. About north 15 Degrees east      x House     21st St. 7/29/2012 Time of Report is 1:08 AM;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679
