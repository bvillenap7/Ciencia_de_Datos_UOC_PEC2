Wing shaped object made no sound;2002-08-28 23:00:00;4 min;Wing shaped object made no sound The object approched from the east and was moving west at approx. 240 degrees. It was a rectangular wing shape with three rectangular panels (under side) one centered and the other two located near the wing tips. All three panels omitted a soft white light or glow. The craft was traveling at approx. 1000 ft. AGL at about 50 nauts. As it passed directly overhead a family member produced a spot light but there were no visible markings. We kept the spot light trained o the object for about 15 sec. when it began to increase its speed and altitude in an exponential mannor. The wing climbed to approx. 15,000 ft. at a rate similar to that of a Lear jet. This is the second time I have seen this object the first time was in May. 02. but it was moving to fast to make a clear description. On both ocasions the object was traveling in the same direction and altitude and did not make any audible sounds.;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679

It first appeared like shooting star, but then turned in to a triangle with dim lights, it lasted for twenty seconds then vanished.  It was about as high as a plan coming in for landing.   The lights on the object where on the two matching sides of the triangle.  It appeared to have the ability to make itself transparent.   No sound came from it and it moved at a steady speed.
