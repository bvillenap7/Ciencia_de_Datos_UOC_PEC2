My daughter was distraught and with a shaken voice said, What is that in the sky? I looked up and observed four objects in a perfectly parallel shape directly apart from one another.  They were very bright white lights, and the shape of the object was clear at first almost making diamond shapes with a slighter larger bottom to them.  By the time I pulled over to view what they were, they had moved into an almost triangular shape, as far as their positions.  There were two on top a small distance away from one another, and two on the bottom a further distance away again in a perfect matching distance away.  The two on top after about a minute, started to flash red lights, the two on the bottom did not and remained very bright white lights.  They were making extraordinary unison distances that seemed to match perfectly, as well as gliding across the sky perfectly.  By the time I drove home, they were barely visible and my daughter mentioned had vanished at one point.  It was very disturbing, because so few seem talk about these events and I have another sighting which is still hard to talk about to this day, as I believe I witnessed the exact location of where these UFO's land and take off from.  I will write at another time, but for tonight seemed again a four object UFO sighting.;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679
