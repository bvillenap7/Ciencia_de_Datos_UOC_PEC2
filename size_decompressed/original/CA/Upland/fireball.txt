Blue/ Green Fireball fly across the sky in Upland, Ca 3/18/07;2007-03-18 19:00:00;10 seconds;Blue/ Green Fireball fly across the sky in Upland, Ca 3/18/07 My family and I were at a  park in Upland CA one evening on 3/18/07.  As it started to get dark I looked up to see a strange Blue/Green fireball in the sky with an orange tail behind.  The fireball traveled from North to South across the sky and seemed to be pretty low.  I started to scream LOOK, to get the attention of others around me.  We stood in amazement not knowing what we just witnessed.  After about 10-15 seconds it disappeared.  Since then I've tried to research to see what it was that we witnessed.
