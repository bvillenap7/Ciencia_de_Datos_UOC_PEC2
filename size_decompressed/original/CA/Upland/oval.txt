Cloudy with different color tones white,dark.As the clouds broke i noticed a oval shaped white light..  At first thinking it was a trace cloud..or a puff of cloud..But no it was a white oval shaped dense light..its altitude was high(not sure#)The small oval object hovered and as the clouds closed disappeared.  Then reappeared as the blue sky broke.Hovered there ,never really moving..a little slightly to the left it moved..  This was an object,it had mass.. Maybe a satellite, Not sure???????..  Object(white oval)size (very small-considering distance-compared to clouds still seemed small)...Time (about 15-20 seconds before cloud coverage-then another 15 sec when clouds broke.(clouds closed).seen maybe another 10-15 seconds then disappeared into clouds.. apprx.1:45 pm.....ty.;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679
