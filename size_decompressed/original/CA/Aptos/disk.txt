Disc shaped object with multi-colored light array on bottom observed in Santa Cruz County, CA.;2013-10-05 21:30:00;one hour;Disc shaped object with multi-colored light array on bottom observed in Santa Cruz County, CA. My wife first saw the object from the upstairs deck of our home.  It appeared to the northeast of our position in the Aptos hills of Santa Cruz County and we would estimate it was perhaps 3 to 7 miles away at approximately 30 degrees over the hill beyond our home.  It appeared to be positioned in the area over the San Andreas Fault.  When viewed through binoculars it was producing a changing multi-colored light array on what appeared to be the bottom of the object.  My wife could make out a dome or disc shape above the light array.  I thought I could also.  The array stayed essentially horizontal most of the time. At one point my wife said a ray of light come out of the object. The object appeared to rock slightly from side to side and at one time seemed to be completely sideways with the light array going into a vertical position.   The evening was dark except for the stars and some ambient light from San Jose, Watsonville and Monterey.  No moon was in evidence.  During the hour that we checked in on the object it remained in the same approximate position except for its slight wavering.   The stars continued their upward movement during that time.  In particular I noted the Pleiades rising about 20 degrees to the right of the object while it remained essentially in the same location.  If the cloud cover doesnâ€™t interfere, we will be checking again tonight to see if it returns. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Capella, but the witness insists it was not Capella.  We have invited the witnesses to check the sky again.  PD));36.978;-121.894
