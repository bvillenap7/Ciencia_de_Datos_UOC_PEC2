7 unidentified aircraft speeding across the night sky and leaving no trace (vapor-trail, sonic boom);2002-05-18 21:30:00;5 seconds;7 unidentified aircraft speeding across the night sky and leaving no trace (vapor-trail, sonic boom) I was standing in the driveway of our house in Aptos. I looked up to the sky to see if the clouds were forming or if an on-shore flow would produce fog for the night. I noted the weather was clear and the moon was one-quarter full and at a 30 degree arc from straight up. It was during my weather evaluation that the UFO or UFOs came into view. Their movement was rapid, and were only in sight for about 5 seconds. They moved across the sky at an 85 degree arc in less than 5 seconds. There were at least 7 lighted objects, blue in front and mostly red in back, but they did not have a tail like a shooting star. They came side-by-side and their formation was straight. They flew past me and then ascended rapidly upwards to the point where I could no longer see them. I realized these were not military aircraft of any kind, and this discovery was quite startling to me. I was listening for a sonic boom as they passed, but it did not happen so I went inside the house and called 911 who stated to call the UFO Center.;36.978;-121.894
