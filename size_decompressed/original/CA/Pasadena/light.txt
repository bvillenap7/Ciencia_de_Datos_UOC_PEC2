Disapearing sattellite like object spotted above Los Angeles County.;2000-11-18 18:30:00;1 minute;Disapearing sattellite like object spotted above Los Angeles County. My Lady and I were out in the front yard looking for our chickens that had gotten out of the back yard. It was a very clear night and the stars were shining nicely. I layed on my back in the driveway to look into the sky as I often do on nights like this. There was a couple of planes in the sky, one local and one in the distance. My Lady and I both noticed a light travelling at a very quick pace. This object was moving across the sky from NW due SE and appeared to be very high up. The light was bright and appeared white. She asked me what I thought it was and we both thought it may be a sattelite, which was a bit out there because we were in the city. We have been out at the Salton Sea and seen a sattelite clearly along with a nice view of the Milky Way. This object was clear and moving across the Pasadena sky, which has a lot of light pollution. The object had just passed above us, at the same high altitude, and started to change in color from white to red and then it vanished. It was a very clear night, and this object did not have a blinking beacon like all other craft in the sky!;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
white ball of light streaks to earth makes a 90 degree turn and streaks out of sight;2001-12-08 01:22:00;7 seconds;white ball of light streaks to earth makes a 90 degree turn and streaks out of sight Saturday Dec 8 2001 1:22 a.m. Pasadena Ca I was driving home from work on the 210 freeway between the Fairoakes cutoff and the lake Ave. cutoff in Pasadena when my eye caught a ball of light streaking extremely fast to the earth when it was about two to five thousand feet from the ground it made a 90 degree turn and streaked in to the distance and out of sight. The whole incident lasted about 7 seconds. I witnessed that meteor shower a short time ago, so this clearly was no meteor. It was a white ball of light.

Very bright stationary light in vicinity of LAX.;2003-12-11 17:50:00;30 minutes;Very bright stationary light in vicinity of LAX. While at work I saw a very bright, unmoving, unblinking light SW of my position in Pasadena, putting it over the LAX airport area. I pointed it out to my 19-year-old son, who works with me. We observed it through his infrared scope and zoom digital camera. It appeared to be a very bright, solid object without appendages. Occasionally it showed a bluish tint, but basically was white. It was clearly not an airplane, helicopter, blimp, balloon or anything else we could think of, and it was much too bright to be Jupiter or Mars. In addition, the weather on this day and evening has been very windy, especially for LA, and yet it just hung in the sky without moving for a minimum of 20 minutes. This really added to the anomaly, since any untethered object like a balloon would have moved very obviously. It must have certainly be seen by thousands of early evening (5:50 to about 6:30) rush-hour commuters. After about 20 minutes, we decided to drive towards it. We were successful in keeping it in sight, but eventually it receded and we lost sight of it in the SW skies. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness intends a date in 2003.  Venus currently is in the southwest sky, we believe, at the time of day indicated by witness.  PD));34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
6 balls of orange-red lights hovering over Mt. Wilson near San Gabriel Valley.;2013-10-27 21:45:00;4 minutes;6 balls of orange-red lights hovering over Mt. Wilson near San Gabriel Valley. Leaving driveway in car, stopped completely and got out of car when I noticed what appeared to be 6 slowly moving objects..orange-red balls of lights out in front/over the San Gabriel mountain range near Mt. Wilson (directly Northeast).   I've watched the sky like any normal person would over my lifetime and this stopped me dead in my tracks.  Absolutely not helicoptors, planes, etc.   They flickered, hovered, pulsated and were slowly rising upwards together...changing positions slightly as they rose, then one by one appeared to just disinitegrate...or fizzle out of sight.   As huge as these lights were, I am hard-pressed to believe NOBODY ELSE IN ALL OF LOS ANGELES SAW THEM.  I can't find any other report.   Please reply if you saw this or have an explanation~;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
Bright, star-like object traveled slowly across very large portion of sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;10 minutes;Bright, star-like object traveled slowly across very large portion of sky, leaving green/teal glowing streak and hazy cone of light behind. An small, star-like object (possibly a rocket?) was seen traveling slowly accross the southwest portion of the sky.  It had a very large, bright, glowing cone of light trailing behind it that faded after a few minutes. There was also a long, thick, greenish-teal streak that trailed behind it.  After the light cone faded away, the object continued to travel northwest while the green streak grew shorter until it looked like a large glowing oval-shaped ball left behind, until it, too, faded. The star-like object continued to travel northwest until it became blurry and dim.  It got lower in the sky and disappeared.  This all took place in the span of about 10 minutes and was observed from Pasadena, California, on 11/7/15 at about 6:00PM. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.

Object entered the atmosphere and then moved slowly towards the west  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;5 minutes;Object entered the atmosphere and then moved slowly towards the west Me and my two boys watched something enter the atmosphere from SW sky. You could see a bright dot and then a cone form behind until it was within the atmosphere. The cone turned into t rail that was blue-green in color. We then watched whatever it was move slowly towards the West until we lost visual sight of it. Its entry was so bright it could not be missed. It could have been anything but most stuff I am aware of burns up on entry, not come in and then slowly float away. I did not have my phone with me, I was in the center of our condo complex to take out the garbage. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
All of a sudden, my husband and I saw a light shoot straight down from the sky and disappeared into the mountains. ((anonymous report));2017-09-10 00:57:00;Few seconds;In Pasadena, California, at about 12:57a.m., Sunday, September 10th, 2017, my husband and I were traveling north on El Molino Ave., passing Colorado Blvd., when all of a sudden, we saw a light shoot straight down from the sky and disappeared into the mountains.   It happened so fast I wonder if anyone else saw it? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487

4 orange sphere's over north Los Angeles basin;2020-10-20 21:30:00;>5 minutes;4 orange sphere's over north Los Angeles basin I work on the corner of Lake Avenue and Cordova in Pasadena, CA.  I left work last night about 21:30 and headed North on Lake Avenue to the 210 Freeway entrance.  As I neared last stoplight on Lake where the freeway entrance is to go East, I saw a man on the edge of the sidewalk to the right of me (300 block of N. Lake Ave.) with his right arm outstretched toward the West sky, his palm was open.  I looked up to the left and saw a group of four round orange lights in a quasi-diamond shape.  The lights seemed to be moving slowly and I could tell they were moving in my direction from the west to the east.  The lights were definitely unlike anything I have ever seen.  The stoplight turned green and I normally would get on the 210 freeway to go East.  Instead, I turned right on a frontage street called Corson and pulled over to look at the lights.  Once I stopped, I could see the lights were still moving in my direction but now two of the lights separated from the other two and went straight up then disappeared.  I grabbed my cell phone and took a short video capturing the two remaining lights in the center of the screen.  Visually, the two lights looked like they werenâ€™t moving anymore, like they were hovering.  I then realized I was parked in a red zone on the side of a street in a not safe place (homeless people, dark area) so I got in my car and headed home, getting on the freeway at the next entrance which is Hill Ave.  When I got home, which is about 17 miles east of where I started, I could not see any lights and do not know what happened to them.  At home, I watched the short video and noticed the beginning of the video captured the second of the two lights that went straight up and disappeared.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
