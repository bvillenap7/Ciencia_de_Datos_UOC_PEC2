Not like any shooting star I have ever seen except in exaggerated artists' renderings. see above The size is the outstanding phenomenon - about the size of a basketball from where I was observing- looked for references to other CA sighting of same phenomenon but have not heard anything. The date is accurate, the time may be a bit off....;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
Bright green fireball travelling east to west over Pasadena, California at 7PM Pacific on 12/28/00;2000-12-28 19:10:00;2 sec;Bright green fireball travelling east to west over Pasadena, California at 7PM Pacific on 12/28/00 My sighting was too brief to merit reporting.  I am only reporting it in case there were other sightings. I was getting into my car and glanced north towards Mount Wilson observatory, which overlooks Pasadena.   I briefly saw a bright florescent green light/ fireball arcing across the sky heading east to west. It was extremely bright and extremely green.  I have a very vivid image of how unusual it looked.   Holding my arm at arm's length it would have only been the size of my smallest fingernail.  But judging by the arc it did not look too high in the atmosphere. It was very much like a falling star/ meteor - but much bigger, closer, right over the city - and extraordinarily vivid green in color. My sighting was a brief glimpse only - it was obscured by a building.  I tried to drive towards the sighting a few minutes later and found nothing.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487

A helicopter was circling around it.  Definitely wasn't a plane or a helicopter.  The object remained stationary the whole time.  Did anyone else see this?&#65279;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
