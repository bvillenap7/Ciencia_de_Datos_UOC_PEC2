Swarm of unidentified objects over Pasadena, CA.;2013-02-24 11:00:00;15 minutes;Swarm of unidentified objects over Pasadena, CA. My son looked up and pointed out that an airplane was standing still.  I looked up to see that one but then saw a small cluster swarm of around 11 of them at what looked like approximately 3,000 feet up.  They all looked like whitish dots moving in a circular pattern.  I took my eyes off of them briefly and really had to look hard to see them again in the same area of the sky flying in the same pattern again.   After about 15 minutes they collected closer together and sped off at a faster speed in a Northwestern direction, true North.  The cluster behavior resembled that of a flock of birds, like hawks or something just moving in a circular pattern.   It's when they collected together and sped off that they moved faster than what birds could possibly maintain.  No birds I am aware of move that fast.  There was no sound.   I have waited to see if anyone else has reported anything and have not heard or seen anything on media or online.  I have never reported things like this online but what was seen was intriguing, I was checking out if anyone reported something to online media, I found this site and decided to post it.  Although I had an iPhone, the optics would not have been good enough to catch what was seen.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
