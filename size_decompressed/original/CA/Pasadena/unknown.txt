Faint moving object glows white then disappears over Pasadena 9/16/04  ((NUFORC Note:  Iridium satellite flare?  PD));2004-09-16 20:35:00;00:01:00;Faint moving object glows white then disappears over Pasadena 9/16/04 I was sitting on my porch, tossing a toy for my dog. I looked up to see only a few stars in the sky it was the very end of twilight. I then noticed a very faint star that had just appeared. Then I noticed it was moving, but it seemed very high in altitude. I thought perhaps it was a satellite, but there was so much light pollution and so few stars visible, it didn't seem possible that a such a small object would or could be seen and tracked. Then, suddenly, the extremely faint object (it was white, no colors that might indicate an aircraft) grew quite bright. I would call it a 'Flare up' in intensity, but it wasn't flickering like fire might. It radiated a bright, pure white light for about 2-3 seconds. Then the object dimmed to it's original faintness. Then it disappeared altogether. My eyes were strained trying to follow it. A few seconds later the object appeared, moving in a dirction at a perfect right angle to where it had been traveling. Then it dimmed and disappeared. This was not an aircraft I'm familar with. It was far to high for a helicopter, and no sound was heard. I'm not really into UFO reporting, but I am into the truth. And this was high enough on the strange meter that I figured somebody ought to know. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed the flare from an Iridium satellite.

somewhat clustered object moving in line;2007-04-23 21:30:00;30 minutes;somewhat clustered object moving in line I had just gotten off the 210 Eastbound Freeway, when I noticed about 5 object slowly moving across the sky. Their distances were evenly spaced out, and the object's exterior lights seemed to pulsate. As they were grouped, they were moving at somewhat of a straight line. They were moving straight, parallel to the mountains, and slowly changed their position SE of the mountains. The shape I could not tell, because they were pretty high up in the air, but their pattern of movement could not have been that or a normal aircraft, because there are not airports in Pasadena. I wear glasses, but can see well. My niece was with me, and she saw exactly what I saw, and she has 20/20 vision. There were no clouds, nor anything that would distort visibility.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487

At 1830, myself and wife were waiting at the bus stop when I noticed a very bright light, orange and reddish In color. Appeared to be hovering...it was a clear night, and very noticeable. Altitude was between 3,000 to 5,000 ft.  Not sure of shape of the object. After 1 minute of being visible, object began moving very slowly, and began to dim til it was invisible.. About 2 minutes later, object had reappeared at same starting location...a small plane appeared to have flown very close to the object.. Stood visible for another minute or two before began moving same way it did and began dimming til it disappeared once again.  Thinking it was over, we looked up towards the sky and the object had reappeared for a third time! Did the same thing, hovered for a minute or so before fading out.. Three sightings in the 10 minute span..same color of object, same starting point, moved and disappeared In the same direction..object seemed to be solid, but appeared to have bl! inking light or lights, not in the usual pattern or brightness in planes or helicopters. Object made no sound, did not leave any trail nor mark in the sorrounding sky.. I took 3 separate videos of the object on my IPhone video camera, one for every sighting...will forward if requested..
