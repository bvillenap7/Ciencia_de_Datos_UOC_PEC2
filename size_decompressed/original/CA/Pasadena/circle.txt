Two orange bright circular objects kept going back and forth in the sky, then disappeared, when the clock hit 12 and it was new years.;2011-12-31 23:53:00;5 minutes;Two orange bright circular objects kept going back and forth in the sky, then disappeared, when the clock hit 12 and it was new years. Me and my friend were walking home, right before it hit new years. I had asked ly friend what time it was and he said it was 11:53 as i remember. We were walking up the street, he was texting, i was looking up at the sky wanderuosly and noticed a bright orange circular light. I screamed at my friend look! Look!  And pointed to it, he ignored me and kept texting. I looked back up and another one appeared and kept moving closer then went back real fast, I then ran to him and turned him around and said look! And pointed again. His face changed to a lost expression and he asked what is that? And I said idk I think it might be a meteor, it was really bright and getting closer, the other one stayed in place. We tried to run (thinking it was a meteor striking earth) and kept looking at it.  I noticed one of the lights got dimmer, and it was any airplane or meteor. It looked like a cell, only the dot in the center was red and the shell around it was orange, afte! r getting dim they both disappeared out of nowhere. The most strange part about this is that right when they disappeared we heard a bunch of people screaming happy new years! As if they disappeared right when it went from 2011 to 2012;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487

Six UFO’s in Pasadena, CA. (video);2018-01-13 12:45:00;1 hour;Six UFO’s in Pasadena CA My cousin went outside to throw away the trash after we finished eating breakfast.  He then returns and tells everyone that their are UFO’s outside.  I thought he was joking but his wife went outside to look first my wife followed and then my kids and I followed.  I looked up and in the sky I saw shiny dots in the sky.  I observed the objects and then returned inside to get my iPhone to document what I saw. I called my sister and told her what I saw and I tried to face time her so she could witness the UFO’s that I was looking at.  The face time did not work because they were to far up and I could not zoom in.  I texted her the photos and videos I took on my phone. We continued watching the objects for 15 minutes or so.  Everyone else went back inside and I continued watching the UFO’s. I then walked for a block to catch a Pokémon and when I looked up I did not see the UFO’s.  As I walked back to my cousin's house, I then saw a father who was looking after his son who was riding a bike.  I told him what I saw and I showed him the pictures and Videos I took.  I then started walking back inside my cousin's house, and I saw the UFO’s, so I ran to the Man with his son and asked if they wanted to see the object I saw.  They said yes.  We walked closer to the house and looked up and showed them.  I asked if they looked like drones.  He replied, “No Way”.  I observed planes in the air and compares them to what I saw and the objects were much higher.  The objects seemed to hover and remain still.  One was slowly moving as the others remained still. My wife and two kids were hanging out by the pool and I joined them.  I only sat outside with my wife as the kids were playing in the pool.  I continued to look at the sky and could only observe one UFO.  The UFO eventually was so far up in the sky I could no longer see it. I was able to observe the UFO’s for close to an hour.  I did not know who to call so I looked up the UFO hotline online on my phone.  I left a message and received a call back and I then wrote down what I observed and filled out this report.  Take a look at the videos and pictures for reference. Thanks, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and found him to be well-spoken, and seemingly quite serious-minded.  He has forwarded four photos and videos to NUFORC, which we plan to post, together with this report.  PD));34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
