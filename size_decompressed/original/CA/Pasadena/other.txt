UFO spotted on spanish tv recording of Rose Parade.;2007-01-01 08:00:00;5 seconds;UFO spotted on spanish tv recording of Rose Parade. I saw this vessel while watching the rose parade on channel 34 Univision here at my home in Paramount.  Me and my mother where watching the parade when they brought in the stealth bomber like they usually do.  Well just behind the bomber just a little above it i saw a strange aircraft that lookew like a grey tube with two other tubes sticking out of the back going up.  I kind of looked like the old star trek ship in the old series.  well this thing was about the same size as the bomber.  At first I thought I was crazy but then I quickly asked my mom if she saw that thing, and she told me that she did and she was just as amazed by it as I was.  Well I saw the english version of the parade on channel 5 and the didn't catch on theyre channel. So maybe if you can get the recording from the parade on the channel 34 los angeles i think you will definitely catch it to. call me back I would really like to see you investigate this thing. ((name deleted))   my number is   562-((number deleted)) cell email is ((e-address deleted))  By the way the object kind looked like it blended in the sky, kind of like who ever made it wanted it to be invisible.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
Moving planes, or stars -- STOP and just hang there, for over 20 minutes;2007-11-10 05:30:00;05:50;Moving planes, or stars -- STOP and just hang there, for over 20 minutes On my way to a neighbourhood coffee shop, (which I do fairly regularly on Saturday mornings) I noticed the planet Venus, as I had seen for the past month.  Venus sat sort of low in the eastern sky.   As I walked, I noticed higher up in the eastern sky, lined up with Venus was what I believed to be 3 stars or distant planets.  I stared at them for a minute because I thought they looked so “cool” lined up like that.   Before I knew it the two (planets or stars) on either side of the middle object (planet, star, or whatever) started in unison moving away from it.   Then I said to myself “Oh those must be jet planes.  They moved an one inch away (from my vantage point), then stopped.  Well, I knew I was not looking at a “man made object at that point.”   A chill went down my spine and the two “star like objects just hung there for the next 20 minutes.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
