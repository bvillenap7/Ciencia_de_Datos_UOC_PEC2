Chevron shaped object zips through Pasadena sky at 19:00 hrs.;2008-11-05 19:00:00;3 sec;Chevron shaped object zips through Pasadena sky at 19:00 hrs. I saw a very large lit craft quickly streak through the sky. It was sort of shimmering but it was traveling very quickly in a horizontal fashion.  I was facing north and the object was traveling from east to west.  What struck me was the fact that it was such a large object in the sky and that it traveled in a quick, dart-like motion.  It seemed to dissolve when it disappeared.  I looked for reports of sightings on google to see if there was a logical explanation and I found this sight instead.
