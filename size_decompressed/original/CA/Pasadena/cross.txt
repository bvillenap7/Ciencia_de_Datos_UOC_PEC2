On further inspection I saw that it was not in fact a balloon, but a plane-like shape.  The object hovered in midair for a few seconds longer and then started to slowly fly away.  It was moving much slower than a plane would.  The object continued in the same direction and eventually moved out of sight behind a tree.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
