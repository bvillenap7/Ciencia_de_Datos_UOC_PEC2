Slow  moving , translucent object , that  blocked  out  other  stars , observed.....;2003-08-16 00:30:00;30  to  40  seconds;Slow  moving , translucent object , that  blocked  out  other  stars , observed..... Shutting  down  for  the  night , was  in  backyard  observing  night  sky  as  I  usually  do , I  saw  a  seemingly  translucent  object  pass  directly  over  my  head , from  a  north-west  to  south-east  direction . It  was  traveling  slow  enough  that , as  it  traveled  towards  the  3/4  full  moon , I  actually  did  see  detail  on  the  object . It  did  not  have  any  lights , though  it  did  have  a  dark  center , the  moon  reflected  a  dull  light  from  it . It  was  the  size  of  an  adult's  index  fingernail  at  arm's  length . As  it  passed  the  moon , it  doubled  its  speed  and  changed  course  in  a  due  south  direction  towards  Orange  County . After  confirming  with  NOAA  that  the  upper  and  surface  wind  flows  were  in  a  southeasterly  to  northwesterly  direction , the  object  defied  the  predominant  airflow , thus  making  obvious  theoretical deductions . In  addition , confirmation  with  Navy  and  Air  Force (Vandenberg AFB) proved  no  exercises  were  enacted  this  particular  evening . Thank  You .;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487

Floating sphere seen changing colors and changing directions over Pasadena Ca. twice this month!;2012-12-14 04:00:00;1 hour;Floating sphere seen changing colors and changing directions over Pasadena Ca. twice this month! I was up at four am this morning and decided to look outside my kitchen window facing west and this is the second time this month I witnessed a moving orb that actually seemed to hide behind the trees in front of our apartment.  I watched this object actually moved right in front of my eyes and then seemed to just fly out of sight.  I have had other sightings and photo proof as well, real photographic evidence that will be sent to you real soon.
