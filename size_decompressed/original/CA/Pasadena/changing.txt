Two glowing jellyfish-like objects float across Pasadena, CA sky;2001-11-17 20:00:00;3 minutes;Two glowing jellyfish-like objects float across Pasadena, CA sky I'm a 22 year old computer science major from University of Washington, in Pasadena for a co-op job with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I stepped outside my apartment (near intersection of E. Del Mar Blvd. and Hill Ave.) this evening to walk to my car and happened to notice two glowing shapes crossing the sky from the North-West. They were irregularly shaped, lumpy, and fuzzy. The best way I can summarize their appearance is to describe them as glowing jellyfish. They seemed to changed shape as they floated silently together across the sky, finally disappearing into the haze above the South-East horizon. They were probably five to ten diameters apart from each other, and about doubled their distance in the time that I watched them. They were side-by-side, although the West-most object lagged slightly. The really strange thing about them was that they each had several blobs inside them that were glowing brighter than the rest of the object. These blobs moved, sort of tumbling around inside. I'm sure there are others out there who got a better view of these objects than me. Many people in the LA area must have seen them, especially since there might have been people out watching the meteor shower that's supposed to be happening tonight. A plane was also in the sky, traveling East to West.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
Object  over  Altadena  witnessed  by  2;2003-08-30 18:40:00;1 minute;Object  over  Altadena  witnessed  by  2 Looking  northward , I  observed  a  black  object  slowly  floating  across  the  sky  in  a  northward  direction , over  Altadena , very  close  to  JPL . After  watching  it  for  approximately  20  seconds , it  dramatically  flattened  out  to  a  near-perfect  arch . It  was  then  when  my  fiance' joined  me . We  immediately  observed  the  object  emit  an  arching  light  from  just  above  the  leading  edge , (the  sun  had  set  entirely  within  the  past  hour  of  our  observation , solar  reflection  was  improbable ).The  object  continued  to  change  shape  similar  to  a  large  plastic  trash  bag . As  it  approached  the  the  ridge  of  the  mountains , to  our  surprise , it  disappeared  behind  the  mountains , indicating  it's  extreme  size . This  is  the  third  time  in  the  last  three  weeks , we've  seen  these  peculiar  'floaters' and  they've  always  been  observed  near  the  western  ridge  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the witness intended a date in August 2003, not September.  We have amended the date above.  PD));34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
White Glowing Object Changing Shape Over Pasadena, CA;2010-03-14 16:00:00;25 minutes;White Glowing Object Changing Shape Over Pasadena, CA I went into our back yard and glanced up and saw a slow moving white object. I went back in the house and got my camera and a pair of binoculars. The object was still there when I came back and it was moving slowly in a NE direction. I figured it was a weather balloon, but decided to watch it anyway. The sphere, or circle was white and had a glow. It moved slowly for another minute and then...stopped. The sphere remained stopped for about 15 minutes in the same spot, so I had plenty of time to get photos with my digital camera(I realized it could not be a balloon since the wind would have moved it along).The object also appeared to change shape or wobble. The object was a few miles away so the shots were taken by using the zoom on my camera. There was no sound and the sphere appeared to be about 8,000 feet up. The object then changed direction and moved slowly going south and out of distance. I have two pictures. One is of the glowing sphere/circle and the o! ther shot I did not see with the naked eye.  But my digital camera picked it up.  I think as the object was changing shape, my camera caught some type of morphing or energy field in between the diffferent shapes? The sky was completely clear -- no clouds and bright blue sky.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
Hovering red orb disappears then reappears as grey-white oval before disappearing again.;2013-02-14 21:10:00;5 minutes;Hovering red orb disappears then reappears as grey-white oval before disappearing again. It was very creepy indeed. First saw the red glowing orb (very dark red with like a halo around it) looking east.  Then the red orb disappeared, like GONE where did it go?  Then after staring at the same direction for a few minutes, another greyish-white object came diagonally down from north to south and toward the horizon before I lost sight of it.  Mind you, this grey-white object was NOT illuminated at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
Black rotating or shape shifting object sores through clear day sky.;2018-01-29 17:42:00;25 minutes;Black rotating or shape shifting object sores through clear day sky. I noticed this black three dimensional object floating across the sky.  There was zero clouds in the sky, and it was right before dusk.  The object was very clear to see, about 100% visibility. It looked triangl-er in shape at first, but with flat edges connecting it, not points like a regular triangle.  It seemed to be rotating at a constant pace.  Either that, or it was shape shifting. It was moving pretty slow, felt like 5mph. It had to be about 300-500 feet in the air, could be more.  The object seemed to resemble the size of a large storage truck, could’ve been bigger.  The object made zero sound, and had no lights on it. It was definitely too big to be a drone, and kept it’s pace until I was unable to see it anymore.  From where I first saw it, to where I couldn’t see it at all, would make me believe it was not being controlled by a remote from the ground. I was only able to capture this on my mobile phone device (13MP Camera), which isn’t capable of shooting great quality video from that far away.  I was fortunate to even capture what I captured.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
