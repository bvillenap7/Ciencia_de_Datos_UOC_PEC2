Powerless over UFO sighting.;1971-10-01 22:00:00;3 min;Powerless over UFO sighting. This sighting took all of three minutes. After a night class my buddy and I went for a walk around the block and on the way back we stopped walking, I don't know why we stopped walking and was confused because we wanted to get back to the dorm. I looked at my friend and he looked at me and I said well lets go, and he said ok lets go, and we just kinda walked around in a circle and once again I said lets go and he said ok lets go but we couldn't go!  it was really wierd, we were seemingly stuck in a 8 ft circle of side walk and we were very suprised, now we were two big guys I an ex hockey player and my buddy a football player, believe me we could run through a freaking brick wall but we couldnt walk on and then at the EXACT SAME INSTANT (like we were allowed to now see) we both got scared and felt the hair stand on end and looked up across the street above a 3rd story bank building at a perfect flying saucer, it was white on top and the bottom was red & blue  I estimate the size to be a 150 ft in length and it was close enough if I had a rock I could have hit it. No noise. It just hung there and then zig zagged away & going straight up faster than anything human can.  Now, we can walk and now could HEAR...cars going by in the street and right next to us was a shopping center and could hear the shoppers rolling their carts to their cars etc.  all this time we were in like a cone of silence and didn't even notice it till the sounds came at us  again.  We both deceided right then and there not to tell anyone but when we got back to the dorm which was on top of a small hill overlooking the bank building we went into the top floor where students would congreate and guess what everybody was talking about the flying saucer they saw, we still kept our mouths shut though, but I dont know why, I feel that I was kinda asahamed at my powerless position.  and ny buddy and I would never talk about it.  No drugs No drink.  Just studies (Tough engineering college in Pasadena!)  I swear its true and when! I ever hear stories about people being abducted by aliens I know what it feels like to be powerless and I didn't freaking like it one bit and I'm really PISSED OFF still about this whole incident 35 years later!!?  What am I a freaking bug being looked at and controlled?  No other incidents to report.  Glad to get this off my chest finally. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Rose Bowl Disks;1991-07-15 12:00:00;6-8 seconds;Rose Bowl Disks Peter, I'm not sure how this will help your research but I would like to submit my sighting.  During the summer of 91 or 92 I saw the following: My friend and I were flying kites at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.  If it wasn't for that fact we would not have saw what we did.  We were seeing how high we could get our kites on a light windy day when out of the corner of my eye I saw three disks.  I pointed them out to my buddy and we stood there speechless.  They were traveling on an approximate magnetic heading of 360 to 010 degrees at a 80 degree angle from the horizon so almost directly overhead. From my perspective it was from the right to left.  They were solid luminescent white in appearance in a close triangle formation like military jets.  They were at high altitude traveling at extreme speed on a straight course.  At arms length they each would be the size of a dime.  They traversed the sky in about 6-8 seconds.  Traveling much faster than the speed of sound.  They made no sound, and no sonic boom.  About me: I'm a private pilot with about 5 years flying experience.  I've been an aviation enthusiast since I was a kid attending many air shows at Edwards Air Force Base, Point Magu and many other locations.  Including the Edwards 50th anniversary where the SR71 flew at plus mach speeds.  I've also seen the Space Shuttle land there many times so I know these disks were traveling at extreme speeds.  By silhouette alone I can identify every aircraft know to the public.  I've also been reading Aviation week magazine for years.  These disks are not conventional aircraft to say the least.  Thank you for your work. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487

A disk shaped object hovering in one spot over Pasadena, CA while da lit up bottom of object was circling while top of it wasn't moving;2012-07-04 22:20:00;approx. 1 minute;A disk shaped object hovering in one spot over Pasadena, CA while da lit up bottom of object was circling while top of it wasn't moving On July 4, 2012 at approximately 10:20 p.m. my boyfriend and I were driving on the 210 east freeway in Pasadena, CA heading toward the 134 west when my boyfriend and I spotted an unusual object in the sky. We were looking southeast and we saw it for about one minute.  We could have seen it longer but we were on the freeway so we had to pass it because we couldn’t stop, so I do not know how much time it was hovering in the sky. The object we saw was disk shaped with lights on the outer rim, and then a few feet above the disk was just a light which was the tip top of the object.  This was all one ship but the body of it that led to the light at the tip top did not have lights.  The disk with the lights on the outer rim was spinning in a circle constantly while the body and light at the very top was not moving.  The whole entire object was hovering in one spot.  The color of the lights was slightly orange.;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
A disk shaped ufo with several lights and one single light on top hovering over Pasadena, CA;2012-07-04 22:20:00;approx. 1 minute;A disk shaped ufo with several lights and one single light on top hovering over Pasadena, CA On July 4, 2012 at approximately 10:20 p.m. I was driving on the 210 east freeway.  I spotted lights so I look up in the sky to see if it is a plane or something. I looked again and I noticed it was still there just hovering.  At that point I yelled at my girlfriend, “It’s a fucking UFO!” Then my girlfriend saw it as well and confirmed that it must have been a UFO.  I wanted to take a picture so I decided to pull over on the freeway but unfortunately there were trees blocking the object.  We proceeded to continue on the freeway and it was still there hovering up and down.  It was a disk shaped with lights and a single light on top.  The lights were slightly orange.  The disk part was circling while the entire object was in one spot.  I saw it for about 1 minute because I was on the freeway but it was there longer. 07;34.1490464551495;-118.138839835487
