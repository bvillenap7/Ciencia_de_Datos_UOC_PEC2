Blue-green fireball with a tail to the NW headed down and to the west appeared to be 13-17 miles away towards San Francisco Bay;1999-01-11 17:47:00;3-5 sec;Blue-green fireball with a tail to the NW headed down and to the west appeared to be 13-17 miles away towards San Francisco Bay I was headed north on I-680 at Sycamore Valley exit in Danville.  In the NW, I saw a blue-green fireball with a tail descending at a steep angle (on a clockface it would have fallen through 7:00).  It disappeared behind the hills above San Ramon Valley to the W and NW.  The object was the size of a large star.  With the arm outstretched and fingers on top and bottom of the tail, it would measure about 1 inch.  It's light was about the same brightness as planes flying overhead.  It was very visible though it was late dusk.  (It was only slightly smaller and much brighter than Hale-Bopp appeared in the bay area.)  My sense was that it was headed for the bay, which would have made it 13-17 miles away. I am a computer professional with no military nor pilot experience.;37.8183208695653;-121.954867826087
