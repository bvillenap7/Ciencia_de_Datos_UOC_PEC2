Some friends and I were outside, cleaning up after a backyard barbeque, when my friend looked up and pointed out an apparent satellite.  I looked up and saw it moving north to south, almost directly above, at approximately 80 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It was moving steadily at about the same apparent speed one would expect from a satellite, but it was brighter, about like the magnitude of one of the planets.  But as soon as I saw it, we observed 2 other similar objects in the same immediate area (within the diameter of a basketball held at arms length).  Each object was traveling steadily at the same pace but in different directions.  One to the south, one to the northeast, and one to the north.  Within seconds, each one faded out and disappeared.  I couldn't gauge their altitude, but they were way up there and silent.  Not really an astounding sighting, but unusual.  My friend is a sales consultant, I'm an architect and private pilot.;37.8183208695653;-121.954867826087
