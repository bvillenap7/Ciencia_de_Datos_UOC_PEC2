Hovbering object with red and white , very bright lights  followed by 2 possible airplanes .;2007-10-19 22:30:00;5 minutes;Hovering object with red and white, very bright lights followed by 2 possible airplanes. A 2 cylinder type shaped object with red   and white , very bright lights appeared hovering in the sky.   The object was not moving . As we observed to see what it was it suddenly disappeared.  About   3 minutes later a new object appeared , very low in the sky so we thought it could not be an airplane . This new object was moving in and out of the cloud cover . The new object seemed slightly different in shape , but still had very bright red and white flashing lights . After watching it , and then seeing another very similar type object we decided maybe it was a plane . It appeared something dropped out of the 2nd object , later I thought it was a falling star possibly.  In total there were 3 items seen . 2 moving , possibly planes although incredibly low for jets . The first item , very unusal in shape  and motionless other than flashing lights  was a ufo of sorts and not a plane.;37.8183208695653;-121.954867826087
