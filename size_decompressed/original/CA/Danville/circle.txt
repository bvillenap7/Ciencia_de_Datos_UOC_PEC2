4 bright shiney cicular objects in a close knit group seen over Mt. Diablo in broad daylight.;2004-08-31 14:00:00;2 minutes;4 bright shiney cicular objects in a close knit group seen over Mt. Diablo in broad daylight. While waiting at a stop light on Crow Canyon Rd. a couple blocks before Camino Tassajara Rd. looking North above Mt. Diablo, I saw 4 bright, shiney, circular objects moving away and up into the upper atomosphere.  The 4 objects moved left and right amongst them although they stayed together in a group of 4 close together as they travelled.  They were not moving like a formation of 4 planes.  Also a jet liner travelled across the view, West to East,between me and the 4 objects, so I had a comparative object for size.  The 4 objects continued their accent and were soon out of my line of sight. The weather was perfectly clear day with bright sunshine.;37.8183208695653;-121.954867826087
Dull yellow non flashing light traveling from south to north making no noise above the San Ramon Valley;2006-07-23 21:30:00;1-2 mins;Dull yellow non flashing light traveling from south to north making no noise above the San Ramon Valley My wife and I were watching the stars as there was no power for several hours when we saw this circle object flying from south to north in a uniform fashion. This object was light yellow in color and had no flashing lights and made no sound. If I had to guess I'd say that this object was traveling 1/3 to 50% faster than faster than a airliner at full cruising altitude but was much much higher. This object also made no sound and one point appeared to pass behind a star in it's travel. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Quick bright streak across sky going faster than Mach 1;2019-11-17 00:19:00;2 seconds;Quick bright streak across sky going faster than Mach 1 I was sitting in bed and I hear a weird  radiating sound so I look out my window to see a bright white circle go flying across the sky at incredible speeds.  Myself as a pilot could tell that almost no aircraft could go that fast without a sonic boom or deafening sound.;37.8183208695653;-121.954867826087
