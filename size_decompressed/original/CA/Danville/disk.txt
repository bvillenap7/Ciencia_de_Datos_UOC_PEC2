100 people saw a neon orange glowing saucer disappear into the hills.;2002-09-20 10:30:00;apprx. 2 mins;100 people saw a noen orange glowing saucer disappear into the hills. It was very dark outside and we all looked up to see a bright, neon ornage saucer moving at a very slow rate into the hills. It hovered for maybe lessthan two minutes and then completely disappeared beyond the hills. It seemed like it was spinning very fast. It was not a lit up, it was actually glowing. There was now rays of light shining off of it. I was with about 100 people outside a park and all you could hear was screaming from all of my friends. There was also a little dome on top of the saucer. The bottom of the saucer was smooth and rounded. My friend took pictures. There were about 10 search planes in my area after it happened that were hovering very low. We also saw a military jet fly by. Something had to have happened.
