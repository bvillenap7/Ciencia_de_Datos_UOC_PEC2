Perfect line of approximately 30 to 40 star like object across the sky going SE from the NW.  ((Starlink satellites??));2019-12-10 05:35:00;5 Minutes;Perfect line of approximately 30 to 40 star like object across the sky going SE from the NW. While opening my gate this morning I happened to look up and see what looked like a perfect row of stars.  Except this was spread out perfectly and moving from NW to SE in what seemed to be an endless line.  I stared for approximately 1 minute thinking I wasn't fully awake.  Finally, I ran in and woke my wife to verify what I was really seeing.  She couldn't believe it either but it was happening.  Counted 21 by at that time and I told her I watched for about a minute before even running to get her.  I estimated about 20 before she was able to get out to see.;40.0602;-104.6496
