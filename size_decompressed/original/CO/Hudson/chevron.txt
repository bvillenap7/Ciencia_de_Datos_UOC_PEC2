At first we thought it was a dark shadowing cloud but observed movement to be moving faster and unconventional to cloud formations.  Beginning translucent the object suddenly illuminated as to 'glow' with a green hue.  It had a defined outline of a chevron type shape once we acknowledged it.  The perimeter of the object was illuminated as to define edges with a rope style light.  At that time the object made a banking move turning right, directly going east.  It was also observed to pickup speed before disappearing on the horizon.  No sound, smells, noises, vibrations or otherwise were experienced during this event.  Skies were clear with stars shining with the moon at our backs.  It was as if everything and everyone around was unaware of it's presence.  It seemed as if the object was aware of us observing it.  This is what we feel made it intiate the illumination and banking maneuver.;40.0602;-104.6496
