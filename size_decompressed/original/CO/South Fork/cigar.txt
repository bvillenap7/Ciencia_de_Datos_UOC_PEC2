Shinny Cigar shape in sky on clear day.;2001-10-04 14:00:00;2 min;Shinny Cigar shape in sky on clear day. Driving in the mountains on a clear day (blue sky in eary afternoon)we saw a shinny silver object in the sky (Cigar Shape). It was either not moving or moving very shlowly. By the time we found a safe place to pull over it was gone with no sign of it in the sky at all. My first assumtion was that it was the suns reflection off of a plane, but it was no where in the sky when we stopped. It may have been nothing, but it was odd.;37.6693;-106.6135
