Bright blue rectangle ufo pass over;2006-11-07 19:00:00;1 min;Bright blue rectangle ufo pass over As I was driving home from King Soopers, a bright blue rectangle streaked across the sky in less than 5 seconds from the south to the north, as it crossed about half-way through the sky the light changed to red.  I was driving a convertable so any sounds that wouldve been made from a plane or jet would've been easily identifiable, but this object made no noise.  I have studied aircrafts for a couple of years now and I have never seen a flying object with that kind of speed and color emitted from the tail end.  Very strange. Also their were other aircraft in the vicinity so any confusuion was quickly put to rest.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

It was approximately 20 meters above me, and had evenly spaced, orange glows around the edge of the square craft.  It was there and gone in the stealth of the night.
