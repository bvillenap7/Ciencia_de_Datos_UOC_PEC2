A large, bright green, spherical object appeared suddenly and proceeded to fall downwards at a diagonal angle pointing roughly north for approximately 3-4 seconds at around 11pm on the evening of 4/20 (no - we weren't stoned, the date is coincidental). It left an orange fiery trail. It appeared to be slightly larger than the moon and was extremely bright. It gave the appearance of burning up - almost like a plane crashing or something. Far too bright and large to be a meteor or a piece of space junk - especially with all the light pollution from the town. It appeared to be extremely close, 15 miles at the most, and very low altitude. My first thought was that it was actually a jet aircraft crashing.. the igniting fuel could explain the color... but there were no reports of anything of the sort. I thought about the possibility of a flare or fireworks... but the altitude seemed too high for that, plus there was no explosion, and the light appeared suddenly in the sky and continued on a steady trajectory heading diagonally downwards at what appeared to be free-fall speed - I don't know of any pyrotechnics that can behave like that. Since it looked as though something had crashed and it was extremely nearby, we drove up to the reservoir in the foothills just west of town and looked around. We didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Could this have been some kind of military exercise? The nearest USAF base is cheyenne , wy - about 1 hour drive north, along with another about 3 hours drive south in CO springs. Was there anything scheduled for that night?  Did anyone else see this?

Strange orange flickering ball as big as the moon, bright like a street lamp, 1000 to 2000 ft away traveled NE in a steady pace.;2010-08-27 21:30:00;2 mins;Strange orange flickering ball as big as the moon, bright like a street lamp, 1000 to 2000 ft away traveled NE in a steady pace. A group of about 20 friends were having an evening Birthday party when one of us saw a weird glowing orange ball flying across the sky.  It flickered like fire. It made no sound at all. We all watched it slowly travel in a north east direction.  Everyone in the group had different ideas on exactly how far it was from us, but I thought it seemed close.  Maybe 1000 to 2000 feet high in the air. It appeared about as big as the moon and looked like it was traveling about 40-50 mph in a steady direction (straight).  No one could explain it and we all talked about what it could have been, but the conclusion was no one new. UFO!;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Fight blue fast moving light over Fort Collins.;2011-08-03 05:15:00;1 min;Light blue fast moving light over Fort Collins. We saw a light blue turning red back to blue, look like a circle, over by the mountains about 30 miles from here, it moved zig zagish, and fast (like 600 to 700 mph?), up and down, went North, then South, North, South, then North and vanished.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

A friend and I hiked to the top of Arthur's Rock in Lory State Park (Fort Collins, CO).  After reaching the top, we heard a whooshing noise (described by my friend as sounding similar to the noise she heard incoming mortar rounds make when she was deployed to Iraq).  We looked up and saw a small black round object coming at us from the southwest.  It is hard to say how big it was because it happened so fast and we do not know how far away it was, but we think it was maybe 1-2 feet in diameter.  It was on a perfectly straight downward-angled trajectory and was moving MUCH faster than a bird could possibly fly. It passed over our heads, possibly within 30 yards or less, and continued down towards the road we drove in on.  We expected to see an explosion or puff of dust, but we never saw an impact.  It appeared to change direction and curve slightly upwards, and then we lost sight of it.  My first thought was that someone shot a missile or RPG at us my second ! thought was that it could have been a meteorite.  But I would expect to see an impact from any of those things.  I think we were very lucky we weren't knocked off of the rock!  My friend and I are military officers (medical).;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

Black well-defined circular object moves much faster than jet to the west of Fort Collins on a bright morning.;2015-05-19 11:00:00;2 seconds;Black well-defined circular object moves much faster than jet to the west of Fort Collins on a bright morning. I saw a small, black, well-defined, circular object move extremely fast in front of a white cloud to the west of Fort Collins, observed facing north from Harmony library.   About 10 seconds later, a jet appeared going into the same direction as the black object.  In comparison, the black object may have been around half the size of the jet.  The speed of the black object was about 4 times faster than jets in the sky that day.  I have never seen an object move so fast.  I observed the sky off and on for about two hours and did not see a similar sized object moving at that speed although I saw several insects, birds, and planes fly that morning. This morning there had been many jets/airplanes flying with vapor trails that appeared to be intersecting at 90 degrees.  I took images of the vapor trails earlier that morning.

Saw a white orb enter a small cloud towards the west of Harmony library.  It moved in a zig-zag motion before entering the cloud.  I observed the cloud for several minutes afterwards to see if it would reappear.  It did not.   I took two photos of the clouds, but I did not see the orb at this time.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Group of glowing spherical objects colored red, blue and white traveling from the north to the south;2017-09-22 20:30:00;90 seconds;Group of glowing spherical objects colored red, blue and white traveling from the north to the south Both of my boys, ages 5 and 7 alerted me and my brother-n-law of some lights in the sky. As soon as we looked up we all witnessed a cluster of spherical shapes moving in a southerly direction traveling along the front range.   We didnâ€™t get an exact count of the objects, but my brother-n-law and I agreed between 12-15.  Each object was red, blue or white in color.  Some were larger than others, but unknown if they were flying at different elevations.   There was no sound.  It was partly cloudy at the time and I noticed they were traveling under the clouds.  The whole experience lasted about 1.5 minutes.  The largest sphere I noticed was white and looked like a glowing bubble with something glowing in the center.   They were clustered together at various distances, but they were traveling in a v-shaped pattern.  We watched them until they were out of site in the south.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
A small white sphere that could descend to ground level in seconds where at which time it would begin to glow red and not white.;2018-04-08 01:30:00;5 minutes;A small white sphere that could descend to ground level in seconds where at which time it would begin to glow red and not white. I was the only witness to this event and therefor can only give information about myself.  I am thirty-nine years old and have spent a great deal of time outside and looking to the sky.  Most of my life, I have worked in kitchens and bakeries but I am currently taking classes at the community college.  I hope to earn my associates in science and hopefully transfer to our local four year to study ecology.  I make the same walk often and have never seen anything like this before this time, nor have I since this event. I believe that this event occurred somewhere between 1:30 and 2:00 Sunday morning.  I was walking through the neighborhood on my way home and noticed a star that looked out of place.  When I was able to find a break in both the branches of the trees above and the clouds then I was able to be certain that this was not a star.  It began to glow more brightly and then made some quick movements with angles that would form a triangle.  Once I knew that I was actually seeing something that was out of place I kept the object in sight and continued my walk home. With the craft in sight and well above the level of any clouds, I noticed that the white light that was coming from the craft was getting brighter and realized that it was descending very quickly and moving straight toward me.  In only a matter of seconds it was at the level of the street lamps, and I was now able to see that the craft was a sphere roughly the size of a basketball.  It was no longer emitting white light but had begun to glow red.  The red lights on this craft seemed to move in sort of a rubics cube manner and then it began to ascend back to about cloud level.   I walked the last about six blocks to my home with this craft not following me but staying within sight and almost leading me to my home. During this time the craft descended to within thirty to forty feet of me two more times.   Each time emitting white light when high up in the sky and glowing red when at street level.  The lights were broken up and moving rapidly on the outside of the craft and it sometimes appeared that there was no solid object but more of an organization of tiny lights moving in a cooperative manner through the air.  I was turning onto my street where I live at the fourth house down and was surprised at how un afraid I had been through the first two descents.  The craft then came down to within eight feet of the ground and still moving ahead of me, it went past and around to the other side of my neighborâ€™s house.  This last descent was when I first really got my anxiety up and being relieved to be at my house I went inside and tried to wrap my head around what I had just seen. Once inside my home I noticed a wound on my hand that looked like someone took a tiny spoon and scooped out a tiny bit of my hand.  There was no bleeding, it just was already grown over with a very smooth concave scab.  I am pretty certain that I did not have such a wound when I left my last destination to head towards my house.  The next day I also had what felt like a sunburn on my face.  When I looked in the mirror my face appeared red but unlike a sunburn it this burn was evenly spread throughout every part of my face.  Even under my nose and in the creases around my nose that are rarely hit by the sun was burned.  This burn lasted about a day and a half before I began peeling and within a day or so my face had peeled completely.  I am certain I was not burned by the sun.  I suspect that the craft was burning my skin when it was emitting the white light.  My face was the only part of me that was exposed and when the craft was at cloud level the white light seemed to foc! us right on my face as I looked directly back at the source.  There was no visible beam of light, but I could see and feel this light much more than the glowing red light that would be seen when the craft was at street level. The basic description of this object would be a bright white light when high in the sky and a formation of small red lights when at a level where it could be seen easily.    It could make this type of altitude change in barely over a second and during the first two descents the mass of the object hovered completely still while the red lights rotated around a central mass. very rapidly.   It made no sound and was almost the size of a basketball.   The third descent was the only time I saw the craft move in any direction other than up or down while near the ground.  The red lights would move rapidly almost as if they were being worked very quickly in the same manner a rubicâ€™s cube would be solved only spherical and with thousands of tiny red lights instead of the 54 panels one would find on the standard rubicâ€™s cube.  The object moved slowly as it went around towards the back of my neighborâ€™s house.  As it hovered across my neighborâ€™s house it maintained a height just below th! e level of the first-floor gutters on the house. It seemed to glow more of a golden or white glow that would overpower the red lights and then fade back to a low enough level that the red lights could be seen once again. I was trying to post about this shortly after the event but I had a lot of trouble using my keypad to form the words that I had intended on typing.  This continued for until I had slept a full nightâ€™s sleep.  It felt as if my mind was partially disabled for a bit of time after seeing this object.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
2 parallel objects veering away from each other, moving in unpredictable ways;2020-07-15 22:30:00;5-10 seconds;2 parallel objects veering away from each other, moving in unpredictable ways On the evening of July 15, My friend and I were camping in a remote area about 50 miles west of fort collins, Colorado.  Around 10:30 PM, as we were stargazing through the clear sky, we witnessed two dim objects resembling distant stars traveling parallel to each other northwards.  They seemed to be outside our atmosphere, as they did not shoot across the sky, rather they just slowly glided.  After a few seconds of traveling side by side, the bottom object began to veer off downwards in an unpredictable, jagged motion while the top object continued its path northward.  After seconds of this, they each became too dim to see.  We agreed that we had never seen anything like that before and that it was unexplainable.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
