what we saw was real and the truth;1972-06-30 23:00:00;unknown;what we saw was real and the truth the sighting was seen through a north facing second story window of a 100 year old farmhouse. three family members were watching tv all lights in house were off when first eyewittness saw red and blue flashing lights and said what is that ? second and third eyewittnesses saw what looked like a black helicopter they saw the lights but could hear no saound from the ufo at all. as they all stared transfixed at this ,the object just hovered .the view of what looke like a pilot operating this craft was seen the pilot was wearing a full helmet so no facial features could be seen but the fact is it was human like in form after hovering for what seemed like a short period of time it slowly moved upwards to the roof and quietly left.what was strange is after this encounter you would think the three would have been in shock or scared to death or even call to report this Instead they turned back to continue watching tv all these years have gone by and yet we all remember this in detail and still can't beleive we all just went back to watching tv did we lose time? It was and still is a continueing thought of what and how this was not the only ufo sighting another family member had an even closer encounter with a ufo. she saw a craft with the lights and this one landed in a dark pature in front of this house and she saw three 4 ft tall ? forms come out they also had full suits and helmets on and they came to the large window to her to this day she refuses to detail her experience as it has deeply affected her she was so shocked and scared she ended upstairs sleeping on the floor in her aun's bedroom and when asked why she was there she said you will think i'm crazy but she saw this before we saw ours and we only learned of her expierience about ten years agolet's just say after her encounter she never was the same ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Double boomerang formation or chevrons tip to tip, a dozen or so white lights, not blinking, moving slowly NE to SW, no sound;1998-10-08 21:00:00;30 sec - 1 min.;Double boomerang formation or chevrons tip to tip, a dozen or so white lights, not blinking, moving slowly NE to SW, no sound This sighting occurred in a residential area as I was looking for a meteor shower that was supposed to be happening in the NW sky.  This was no meteor.  It looked like a giant seagull, or two chevrons joined ( ^^ ) [thatâ€™s the closest my computer will match its shape, but more elongated side to side]  It was moving slowly and deliberately NE-to-SW and had a dozen or so lights on the underside.  Had it been standing still, it would have blended perfectly into the night sky, they looked just like stars, only they moved together.  I detected no colored lights.  The shape could have been one unit, two chevrons tip to tip, or multiple in formation, but appeared to move together.  The lights did not blink at all, and I heard no sound.  The impression I had was of a single unit, probably low altitude compared to planes in the area, which were easily differentiated by their lights.  At first I thought perhaps it was just a flock of geese, but I followed it for maybe a 30-second period or longer until it was too far away and too dim to see.  Geese in our area are common, but do not remain visible for long, nor do they fly that uniformly, and they invariably honk.  They (geese) do not look like lights.  It was not an airplane.  I never did see any meteors that night.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
A birght light that was moving around and around then it would come straight down, as if to earth and then back up.;2000-08-11 23:00:00;30 minutes;A birght light that was moving around and around then it would come straight down, as if to earth and then back up. I was laying down, playing talking with my friends, then we started to doze off. I looked up and suddenly said What the hell is that. There were 4 of them, 3 small circles and 1 BIG one. The three were chasing each other as though it were a game of tag. The big one would just stay there.Then 1 fell STRAIGHT DOWN as if it were coming to earth then my friend and I heard a BOOM!! then i saw it fly back up in the sky. After that, all 4 came together (so now there is 1) and they flew straght up into the middle of nowhere.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

iT WAS LIKE HALF BALL HALF TRYANGLE AND WAS YELLOW AND SUDDENTLY DISAPPEARED.;2005-05-14 08:30:00;about 1min;iT WAS LIKE HALF BALL HALF TRYANGLE AND WAS YELLOW AND SUDDENTLY DISAPPEARED. It was like a ball and at the end it had like 2 spikes. It was yellow. It was like half ball and halk triangle.  I saw it and at first I thought, must be my imagination.  but i even rubbed my eyes,shook my head and I even pulled up my glasses all the way up to my nose to see better. But no. It was never my imagination.   I told my mom while she was driving, What is that ugly,scary thing up in the sky?  But when she looked up, there was nothing.  I looked all over for it.  I'm in practicly in trauma right now.  I don't want to stay by myself at all. I am special and I have a gut feeling that something bad will happen if I am alone.   This happened today and I'm in shock.  I'm so scared. I mean why did it dissapear?  How do I know if maybe at night the creatures in that thing come after me and try to do something to me?  i'm scared. HELP.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

Started as one ball of light. Quickly moved and then the one ball turned into 3. The 3 seemed to turn into 15 or 18.  Maneuvered.;2014-10-14 11:18:00;8 seconds;Started as one ball of light.  Quickly moved and then the one ball turned into 3.  The 3 seemed to turn into 15 or 18.  They  darted around then seemingly began outlining what looked to be a bigger object.  At this time there were gaps between the bright lights and the trails of light created what looked to be a much larger object.   Suddenly, the darting stars or lights, became observable lines outlining the object.  I swear it looked like a ship.  From the movies.   Simultaneously as the lights became a solid outline (in between the light there were stars set exeactly how they were supposed to be, in essence it was projecting what was behind it on it or in front of it) it suddenly melded forward, then flat out blasted off from north to south following the mountain ridge line.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
A friend and I saw a V-Shaped craft fly overhead with incredible speed on CSU campus: Fort Collins, CO.;2014-10-19 01:30:00;<5 seconds;A friend and I saw a V-Shaped craft fly overhead with incredible speed on CSU campus: Fort Collins, CO. My friend and I had just started walking from a hookah bar back to the CSU campus where we live.  On the way, we decided to stop at the oval (visible on Google Maps search Colorado State University and look toward the NE side of campus) and watch the stars.  The sky was very clear that night, and we saw a couple of meteors.  Suddenly, a V-Shaped craft came and went.  It was a fly-over moving west and went right over our heads.  The craft was illuminated by 2 distinct orange lights as it moved, but also seemed to be outlined by that same light, suggesting that it had a light on the top side of the ship.  It moved across the sky with incredible speed, but was completely silent.  Since the fly-over, I have had high mental distress.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
DISCO STAR -or- BLINKING STAR update and full report.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  Jupiter??  PD));2015-04-06 20:00:00;Nightly Until Quite Late ;DISCO STAR -or- BLINKING STAR update and full report Ok, the DISCO STAR or twinkling star, I just want to throw my observation in.  It is NOT a star, due to the fact that it does in fact MOVE in the sky and it is NOT a planet due to the fact that it is constantly blinking and changing colors. With that said, it looks like a star to the unenlightened layman viewer just casually glancing at the sky.  It rises in the Eastern sky, and here in Northern Colorado, it is almost always visible (clouds/chemhaze/pollution/weather permitting) by 11pm and usually earlier shortly after nightfall. I watch this thing religiously, and make sure to hold very still and look with both eyes directly at it for long enough to observe it move. It usually moves in a space in the sky no larger than a dime held at arms length, and maintains it's usual position. My father and I have, on one occasion, observed it being in one position and two hours later being in a position some 15-20 degrees North of that position.  This is anomalous movement and activity. The color changing on it is PHENOMENAL.  Mostly what you can pick up is red, white, blue, and green, but it is in fact flashing everything in between when obsevered closely. I will speculate in the following paragraphs, but on pure observation you have a point of light that changes colors, sways and darts around, and sometimes does more DRAMATIC movements which will cause the hair on my neck to stand up from seeing something so incredible. I have become VERY familiar with this sign in the sky, and do my best to show anyone whose path I cross while it is visible. SPECULATION: My fear is that it is a grand deceptive technology put up there [like a rave/concert lightshow on a screen swinging from some servo arm on a weird disinformation satellite] by Government/Shadow[pseudo] Government agencies as a grand deception--or what the hardcore fundamental Christians would call false signs to mislead. What I believe, however, is that it is in fact an intelligently controlled craft of some sort [or possibly a portal/wormhole], though I have seen what looks like short bursts of light emanate from it and believe the possibility that it could be this GREAT DREADNOUGHT class mothership which is bristling with powerful technologies that make the world powers shudder from their helplessness. I believe it is benevolent, and here to show those of YOU / US who care to focus and witness it, that the galactic cavalry is here and things on Earth are changing drastically. Meanwhile, the chemhaze and trailing is almost non-stop, in what I believe an effort to control the skies and what is and isn't seen by surface dwelling earth citizens. I did not mean to make this into a science fiction story, the sighting is REAL and the craft is there for anyone to see, perhaps in low earth orbit. I am actively watching the skies for further revelations of the truth and open my mind to any influence I might receive. My name is ((name deleted)), and I believe.

Dark red object flies fast in weird directions over night sky.;2016-02-27 20:05:00;2 minutes;Dark red object flies fast in weird directions over night sky. My fiance saw something red in the distance and called me to come look, and we saw a dark red toned object flying through the sky.  There were no lights on it but it did seem to reflect red.   At first it seemed like a satellite but then it started swerving its direction back and forth.  Within just a minute, it had flown out of our sight, way too fast to follow, and disappeared into the night sky.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

I witnessed one straight line object with 3-4 red lights that hovered in place, shot straight up in the sky, dropped back down to original position, repeated this again and then as it dropped back to the original hovering location the lights went out.   This was too large to be a drone and was more the size of a large airplane.  However, its movement and behavior were NOT that of an airplane.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
blue and green flaming disk shaped object.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-25 19:00:00;several seconds;blue and green flaming disk shaped object I was driving North on i-25 around 7pm.  Movement to my left (west) caught my eye. I looked over to see something with green and blue flames engulfing the back end of the object. I was looking at it from its side.  The front of the object looked something like the nose section from the side of a C-130 plane.  There were no wings or elongated fuselage or tail section and it was much too short to be an airplane.  The front half of the object was lit by the bright green and blue flames coming out of the back section.  The back section was completely engulfed in flames.  Then the flames stopped suddenly when the object was about 200 feet above the ground.  For a second I saw a dark object, but I couldn't make out what it was or its general shape and then it was completely lost in the dark.  Other than the blue and green flames, the object was not lit up in any way.  It was heading mostly north with a little easterly direction too and moving at a 30 degree angle towards the ground.  estimate its speed at around 130-150mph.  In my opinion, considering the length of the object and the quick glimpse I had as the flames were extinguished, that I was looking at a saucer shaped craft from the side. I have checked multiple times tonight and there have been no reports of a crash site.  I also drove around the area where it would have crashed and there were no wrecked buildings or police or fire trucks anywhere to be seen. I saw no fires or smoke.  My guess is that there was not an actual crash despite the steep angle towards the ground and the 200 feet or so until impact.  No airplane could have navigated away without impacting the ground.
