Parade or line of star like objects in formation..((Starlink satellites));2020-03-06 14:39:00;2 minutes;Parade or line of star like objects in formation I was out on the street on the phone looking at the sky, I witnessed 2 star like objects, one trailing the other relatively close, easily miles above and moving fast.  I pointed them out to 2 of the friends and they went back into the garage, maybe 10 seconds later, one more, then another, then another.  Up to 15 more lights, all following the same path, much more distanced than the 2 before.  We tracked them in the sky for almost two minutes, a parade of starlike objects.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
