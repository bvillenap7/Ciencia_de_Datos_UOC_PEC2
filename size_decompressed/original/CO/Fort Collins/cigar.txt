I turned my head to see what was behind me and observed that there was someting flying 2 feet above my head.  The object was about 3 feet long x 8 wide and made no sound.  It was dull glowing gray in color. I checked it out for about 3 seconds and the moment that I realized that I didn't know what it was, I felt startled and the object traveled straight out in front of me and then up and out of view in about 500 m seconds. About me - I was 11 and probably was into Star Wars too much.  I have always been very detail orientated and when I ruled out that it was a large bird coasting with me, I thought it had to be an estes rocket running on a tight wire.  I spent an hour looking for clues but couln't find any.  I have never told this to anybody and have thought about it every day for the last 30 years.

Craft emerged from lightening storm;2017-05-15 21:43:00;22 minutes;craft emerged from lightening storm 21:43 mountain time:  I was watching a powerful lightening storm off to the north east of FT Collins.  I had taken some footage from downstairs, but was to low to see over the trees.  I decided to go upstairs and look out a back window to see if I could capture more from the storm.  I looked at my phone which had a full battery just 5 minutes earlier, and the battery went from a full charge down to no charge. I thought how strange.  I plugged it in and then heard a sound like a loud roar of thunder.   As I looked out the window I could see something in the distance emerging from the storm which was more of a light show from all of the lightening.  At first I thought it was a plane, but then soon realized this was no plane.  It was much too large and It was glowing red and looked like it had a very bright white light that came around, but from the inside as it circled around whatever this was.   As I watched it fly to the west towards the Mountains the loud roar seemed! to just stop, but the object kept moving. just seconds after it was out of sight the lightening and wind calmed down.  I have seen many strange things, but I must say this is the strangest yet.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Hovering white object north of Ft. Collins, CO. 7/11/18.;2018-07-11 20:25:00;15 minutes;Hovering white object north of Ft. Collins, CO. 7/11/18 My wife and I were on a walk on the evening of 7/11/18 at 8:15-8:45 when my wife noticed a round, extremely bright white object hovering at approximately 30-40 degrees above the northern horizon of Fort Collins, CO.   It was brighter than any star/planet that appears at that time of day.  It moved extremely slowly, if at all, during our observation, which lasted approx. 15 minutes.  The surface appeared to be reflecting the sun's light but was not giving off any light of its own.  The object did not blink or twinkle. The object was also observed by family members that live 9 miles north of Ft. Collins.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
