The strangest light I have ever seen, and the fastest accelleration I have ever seen.;2008-07-31 22:00:00;2 minutes;The strangest light I have ever seen, and the fastest accelleration I have ever seen. I was sitting on my front step on the evening reported, and heard a jet and was watching it travleing from West to East, when a flash of white light cauget my eye in the South. I wached it strobe and travle in a Northernly direction until it was almost directly over head. It was at a tremendous altitude, as compared to the jet that passed by. When it got to the point almost directly overhead, it emmitted a very bright flash of white light, then very suddenly curver to travle in the direction of North by North East, and accellerated at a tremendous burst of speed. I witnessed it travle over the Eastern horizon within seconds after it began it's accelleration. when it began it's acceleration and changed direction it became redish in color, but was too high to make out any detail of shape or sound. I called a Denver news station, WB 2 News, and reported it to that entity, to which I was not asked any info, only that they would make some phone calls, but I was not told to whom.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Flash ball over Ft. Collins, Colorado;2011-06-30 00:20:00;3 Seconds;Flash ball over Ft. Collins, Colorado I sat in a chair out on my deck and looked up at the sky.  I was almost blinded by this ball like flash in the sky.  It looked like a planet exploded or something.  It was very quick, lasting only a few seconds. It did not move it was there, and then it was gone.   There was no plane or stars in its place.  It left a spot in my vision as a cameras flash would.    It was about the same size as a camera flash would have if it were about 10 feet or so away.  It had no rays of light off of it, just looked like a ball of light.   I have never seen anything like this before.  I do not believe in UFO's but this is a mystery to me.   I would feel a lot better knowing what it was, or if anyone else saw it! I can honestly say I will watch for it again!;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
