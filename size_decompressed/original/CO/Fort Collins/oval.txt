The ufo was oval with lights on the side;2000-12-20 00:00:00;camping;the ufo was oval with lights on the side the ufo was oval.  It had different colored round lights lined up on the side of the craft (red, green, blue.)  The ufo seemed black, because it kind of blended into the dark sky.  It was hovering over a road.  It made no noise.  It seemed like it was moving real slow away from us. ((NUFORC Note:  Report from young person.  We will attempt to establish the precise time and date of the sighting, and request additional reports from other witnesses.  PD));40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
String of Pearls  White, cloud colored small ovals that stood still, linked up, and then 1 zoomed into space.;2004-05-03 22:00:00;2 minutes;String of Pearls  White, cloud colored small ovals that stood still, linked up, and then 1 zoomed into space. I did not want to appear as a cook, so I did not report it until I just saw the figures tonight on Unexplained Phenonmeno, so I resorted to the internet and found your site.  What I saw was what was referred to on the television show as A String Of Pearls.  Against the night sky, they where oval and appeared against the sky as small oval clouds, only these where obviously not clouds.  They were much too small and they moved like nothing I have ever seen.  From Ft. Collins, Co., they seemed to appear over Denver, Co., south of Ft. Collins and just east of Denver and the Government's satellite/missle tracking center (I forget it's name)in a granite mountain in the Rockies that is designed to withstand a nuclear bomb.  In a 2-3 min. period, they came out of the clouds, sometimes one would seem to link up to another, but they moved around, sometimes one would stop and then move again.  They moved pretty quick considering their height.  3-5 of them moved around for a few min. (the no. depended upon the cloud cover, some dashing in and out) before all but one disappeared back above the cloud cover.  Only one was left, but after three min., all of a sudden, it moved from a stand still and then went into (terms learned from T.V.)warp drive and dashed off into space, disappearing into space that was not covered by clouds.

Slow moving ellipse lit from beneath by the early-morning sun.;2008-03-10 07:30:00;3 to 4 seconds;Slow moving ellipse lit from beneath by the early-morning sun. Date:  10 March, 2008        Time: 0730 MDT	        Weather:  Clear, about 35-degrees, no breeze   Location:  In the Buckhorn Canyon near Deadman Gulch about one mile ENE of Moody Park in Roosevelt National Forest and roughly 15 straight-line miles west of downtown Fort Collins, Colorado. Description:  I had just started my morning commute to work and was by road about three miles from home which is located in Paradise Park (that’s on about any recent topographic map of the area).   The sun had just broken the higher peaks visible from the canyon bottom as I noticed a glint toward the top of the windshield.  I slowed to take a closer look as the sky was beautifully blue and clear and there should have been nothing in that area of sky.  I’ve driven this route for over 10 years and know it well.   What I saw was an ellipsoidal object lit from beneath by the sun.  It was slowly and noiselessly moving toward the west at, I would estimate, about 10 mph.  It was moving level and in a linear manner.   My first thought was a weather balloon yea, sure, Uncle.  If so, it would be moving against any prevailing breeze which would be from the west to east.  There was no breeze at ground level that morning.    It did not change shape or direction.   I had it in view for about three to four seconds and watched it move behind an unnamed hill which is a small but quite obvious peak from the bottom of the canyon.  On the topographic map the hill is noted at 6897’ in elevation at the top.  I would estimate the object was just below the peak and travelled just south of the peak as the ellipse disappeared behind the peak from the canyon bottom and road.    Based on the spruce trees on the peak, I would estimate the major axis of the ellipse which was horizontal to be about 25’ to 30’ and the minor axis to be about 1/3 that.  It was clearly lit from below by the early morning sun and appeared the white color of the sun, a highly reflective surface which added no spectral modification of its own.  It was totally opaque.   The linear distance from the road, my observation point, to the object was about 0.20 miles.  This is estimated from the topographic map of the area.  If I had been home and looking out the south-facing windows of the house, I would have been looking down on the object and had a much longer sighting Too bad!   Just for interest sake, this was by far not my first sighting nor, hopefully, will be my last.  It is the first I have reported to NUFORC.   I am ((50's-60's)) years old, am a practicing ((deleted))engineer, and have a degree in ((deleted--a science)).  Interests are amateur radio, optical and radio astronomy, general relativity, mineralogy and geology, UFOology, and pushing the limits of electromagnetics.   I presently work as an ((deleted--large, technical company)) in the Denver, Colorado area.  This is all to imply I consider myself a credible witness.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Freak lightning storm with ORB photographed and recorded.;2016-05-22 14:23:00;20 minutes;Freak lightning storm with ORB photographed and recorded. A freak lightning storm with no thunder just high wind appeared out of thin air.  I thought it was strange so I began to take photo's and video.  I caught somthing coming out of a flash of lightning, too fast for a plane.  Then, when I got home, I found an orb in a photo I took.  No sun glare, the orb was passing in between two clouds.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
