The object was of technology that is general knowledge.;1996-06-19 03:00:00;10 minutes;The object was of technology that is general knowledge. I woke up early and made coffee.  Walked out onto the porch.  Facing eastward I can see the lights of Ft. Collins to my left and the lights of Loveland to the right (I was at my cabin above Masonville, CO at the time). From the south and to the east of me something in the sky was moving towards the north.  My best guess the object may have been 3000'-3500' from the ground and mabye 5000' feet distance from me.  I was in awe.  I didn't hear any noise from the object.  It was black and as it moved in front of me I could tell it was triangular.  It was non-reflective or otherwise I would have seen lights from Loveland reflecting off it's belly.  It was much blacker than the night sky.  Stars would disappear as the object moved under them.  I can only guess at the size, there were no lights but since it was blacker than the sky I could tell it was triangular.  I would guess that from the rear tips of the craft that it may have been 125' across the back end.  From the nose to the rear tips mabye 100'.  I'm not sure.  It continued trekking north towards Cheyenne at the same pace as when I first saw it.  I wuld guess the speed at about 65-70 mph.  I watched it till the mountain north of me blocked my view.  This is the first time I've mentioned this sighting. I was a scout in the Marines from 70-76.  I'm pretty levelheaded, never did drugs and don't drink alcohol. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I saw the same tri-angular craft the guy in Masonville Colorado saw 6/19/1996.;1996-06-19 03:00:00;two minutes;I saw the same tri-angular craft the guy in Masonville Colorado saw 6/19/1996. I saw this gigantic object as well.  I was on the CSU campus that morning looking southeast over the student center.  The sky was clear enough I noticed certain stars going missing and reappearing.  After a while, I could make out a huge triangular craft much blacker than the rest of the sky moving northward over I-25 about seven miles east of campus.  It was very large, from my perspective, about six hundred yards long by two hundred yards wide at the rear.   After a while, as it moved into view, I could see its underneath dimly lit by the reflected city lights from Loveland and Longmont.  I backed into the building and shut off the lights.  At first I was not anxious.  From that distance I did not see seams, rivets, windows, lights, etc., and the whole sighting lasted about two minutes before other buildings and trees obscured it from view.  Its path may have been nearly pointed in my direction for the duration which may be why it seemed to crawl along.  No way anything that size would have escaped the attention of NORAD.

two craft with 3 white lights arranged in tringle and red light in center of triangle.  slow flight.  no noise.;1998-09-26 23:00:00;10 minutes;two craft with 3 white lights arranged in tringle and red light in center of triangle.  slow flight.  no noise. On July 31, 1998, ((male name deleted)) and ((female name deleted)). were 30 miles north of Ft. Collins Colorado at a mountain home at about 8500 ft elevation.  At 11 pm they saw directly above two identical objects approaching each other, appear to meet, then cross each other's path, and diverge.  The general flight direction of the entire event was from east to west, and the event lasted approximately 10 minutes.  After the two objects crossed, one's flight path was directly overhead, and its speed was very slow.  It was observed to fly west and appeared to hover far in the west for a long time.  ((witness names deleted)) showed two other people the hovering light in the west.  By this time it appeared no more unusual than a first magnitude star. At the crossing point of both objects their largest angular extent was the size of a ping-pong ball at arm's length.  There was no sound heard throughout the sighting except near the crossing point when a very faint jet aicraft-like sound was heard for less than one second. Since it was dark during the sighting, no shapes were observed for either object.  However the distinguishing features of both these objects were three whitish lights arranged in an equilateral triangle, with a brighter red-orange light in the center of the triangle.  The red light seemed to pulsate.  Strange as it may sound, the red light appeared to grow especially intense during moments of skepticism as the observers speculated about these objects actually being terrestrial aircraft. This pulsation apparently linked to thoughts was most intense as the one object was hovering in the western sky.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
3 flashes then 7 dim lights flying in a V shape.;2002-07-11 01:00:00;one minute;3 flashes then 7 dim lights flying in a V shape. My friend and I were laying in my back yard at about 1:00 in the morning it was a clear night so we could see all of the stars. Then we saw 3 flashes and then about 5 to 10 minutes later we saw 7 dim (they almost looked brownish) lights flying in a perfect V shape. It flew right between my neighbor's (behind us)houses and then between mine and my next door neighbors. It was flying pretty low and there was no sound at all. We couldnt see between the lights so it must have been one object. It flew above us for only about one minute then disapeared. It moved to slow to be a B-2 bomber (which is what we thought it was.)It was bigger then a 747.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

Strange triangle-shaped aircraft with 7 dim lights flying low, fast, and completely silent.;2003-09-23 01:30:00;15 seconds;Strange triangle-shaped aircraft with 7 dim lights flying low, fast, and completely silent. I was up late and standing outside with my dog at 1:30am MDT, just enjoying the cool air and staring thoughtlessly towards the NE sky when over the tree-tops appeared 7 round, very dim pinkish-red lights in a V-shape (one light at the tip, and 3 down each side). The lights were consistent (not flashing).  At first I could barely see the strange lights which seemed to be heading almost straight towards me, but as it approached I could clearly see a large (150-200 foot wide) dark-colored triangle-shaped aircraft.  I estimate it passed about 500 feet to the south of me, no more than 500 to 800 feet altitude, and traveling SW at about 700 mph (estimate based upon roughly 3 miles covered in the mere 12-15 seconds that I observed it).  It did not deviate in either speed or direction.  I was within (no more than) 1000 feet as it passed just south of me and yet it was TOTALLY silent.  The ONLY visible lights were the 7 mentioned above, across the front leading edges.  There was none of the legally required (FAA and military) red and blue wing tip lights, nor flashing strobe lights.  Both the lights AND the aircraft were easy to see looking straight at it, yet would have been just as easily missed had I not been looking right at it as it approached.  I felt like this was intentional, as if to warn close conventional aircraft, but to be otherwise relatively unnoticed.  It was a dark, moonless night (moonset 5:37pm the evening before) yet at the mid-point of my viewing the dark-colored aircraft was quite distinguishable against the starlight... and against the glow of the city lights.  This aircraft was definitely not a B-2 Stealth or any traditional aircraft... TOTALLY silent... unusual shape and lights, and no aircraft that I'm aware of could possibly fly so fast, low, and yet completely SILENT.  At about 3am I called the FAA Regional Control Center in Longmont, CO, and talked with a very helpful and interested supervisor.  In addition to checking their records, he checked with DIA approach (Denver International Airport) as well as Seattle Regional Control Center:  There had been absolutely no military aircraft in the area all night, and no reports of anything out of the ordinary.  I’m sure that this craft was flying below radar.  At the suggestion of the FAA I reported the incident to the National Institute for Discovery Sciences (9-23-03) and now the National UFO Reporting Center (10-01-03).  I have never seen anything even remotely like this before and hope to learn more about what it was.  I’m not one to jump to conclusions, yet I immediately felt that the craft had to be non-terrestrial.  Even if I was to disregard the illegal lighting, we are clearly many, many years away from producing an aircraft with characteristics such as this.  This was an incredibly fantastic experience!

Triangle craft spotted in Fort Collins Colorado;2005-02-03 21:30:00;9 seconds;Triangle craft spotted in Fort Collins Colorado My name is ((name deleted)) and I live in Fort Collins, Colorado.  On February 3rd around 9:30pm I had went out back to smoke a cigarette.  It was a very clear night, not a cloud in the sky.  My backyard is on the north side of my house.  I was looking up at the stars because the sky was so clear.  As I was looking a large craft appeared over my head.  It was the shape of an equilateral triangle and was heading NNW.  About 20 degrees to my left of where I was standing.  It made no sound as it traveled.  The craft's bottom was all I could see.  The base color was black with a hint of grey.  In each of the three corners, not the tips, were three circles that gave off a very dim blue-white light.  It was just the outlines of the circles that gave off the light.  The centers of each circle were the same color as the rest of the bottom.  I remember thinking that craft was so geometrical.  The inner circles were also in an equilateral triangle configuration.  That is if the center of each circle were the points of a triangle.  It felt as if the craft was very close, 200-300 feet over my head.  But as there were no clouds to judge distance with I really don't know.  My view to the North of my house is blocked by the town-homes that are directly to the north of my house.  I estimate that I can only see the sky above 50 degrees from the ground.  The craft traveled over my head till I couldn't see it for what I estimate to be 9 seconds.  I never took my eyes off of it, I felt stunned to be watching it.  If I were to held my hand out as far as I can open palmed it would have not have fully covered my view of the triangle.  After it had passed I went inside and told my roommates what I had seen.  I grabbed a pen and paper and noted the time on my microwave:  9:32 PM.  I then grabbed my video camera and went outside to see if it would return and I could capture it on film.  This time I went out the front of my house and into a field that borders my neighborhood to the South.  I did not see the object again.  I did note however that there seemed to be a lot of smaller planes flying around in the area.  I could see the lights on the planes and could hear their engines.  I noted that one plane was circling the town in my area a half a dozen times while I was in the field.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

3-4 intensifying lights, under telescope triangles with color-changing and cycling lights;2008-12-05 20:30:00;30 minutes;3-4 intensifying lights, under telescope triangles with color-changing and cycling lights At approximately 8:30 mountain standard time, my roommate asked me to come outside quickly.  I did, accompanied by our third roommate and a neighbor.  What we first saw was not immediately striking, approximately 6 to 8 lights in the sky.  These lights were just above the horizon as we were looking in a South-Southeast direction.  As minutes passed, however, 3 or 4 of the lights began to grow in intensity. The colors of these lights also seemed to change.  At times the lights would fade almost to dark, and at others the lights would almost shine in unison as the objects came closer together.   I immediately rushed to get our telescope.  After waiting a few minutes for the intensity of the lights to come back, I focused the telescope on the light.  What I saw amazed me.  In the telescope the light was distinctly recognizable as a triangle shape, almost like a chip, with color changing light traveling around the perimeter in a sort of cycling manner.  All three other individuals looked through the telescope and affirmed the same details triangle, color-changing cycling lights. After a duration of about 30 minutes, the sky went dark.  It might be important to note that throughout the sighting, the additional lights were recognizable as the strobes of aircraft.  A sound was only present when many of the planes heading in the direction of the intensifying lights passed over our house.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

A triangle of five lights in “V” formation flew directly over Fort Collins, moving from east to west across the sky, around 8:00pm on November 12th, 2012.  The five lights were in a “V” formation of faint white light that were glowing solid as it moved across the night sky.   No sound could be heard coming from this object and the lights were not flashing as seen on any other identifiable aircraft in the air at night.   It moved quickly at a constant speed flying from the east, heading west.  I tracked it for about 10-15 seconds before I lost it beyond the haze in the western sky.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

A friend and I noticed three triangular crafts directly overhead.;2015-10-16 19:00:00;7:55pm - 8:34pm;A friend and I noticed three triangular crafts directly overhead. Witness 1:  	A friend and I were at Spring Canyon Park, Fort Collins CO, having a conversation, when I noticed what appeared to be a kite like object gliding through the air above me.  I could barely distinguish it from the darkness of the sky, but I could see it enough to determine a shape.   It was a V-shape with five dark grey circles, two on either side and one in the middle.  It was maybe 500 feet in the air and moving slightly faster than that of a plane making absolutely no noise.   My friend did not notice this first sighting, so I took him to the other side of park in hopes that it would return.   At 8:15pm, we both noticed what looked like a similar craft to that of the first sighting gliding north to south more to the west then the original craft.  We then decided to lay down and sk watch hoping to see another craft.  At 8:27pm we noticed a very large craft roughly 500 feet in the air.  It was noticeably larger than the other two. noticeably this craft was a different shape. this one being ! a wide set isosceles triangle.  It flew northwest to southeast directly over us at a  lower altitude than the other two crafts and this time it flashed many intricate small lights over us before it disappeared. Witness 2:  	At around 7:55 my friend claimed that he saw a V-shaped UFO in the sky.  I was a little skeptical at first, however I was intrigued, so I decided to listen to what he had to say. we proceeded to skywatch in different locations around the park and at 8:15pm he spotted a V-shaped craft again this time I was quick enough to catch a 3 to 5 second glimpse before it vanished into the night sky.  I felt like we should stay and see if it would return again. we found a place to lie down and watch the sky.  My friend noticed yet again it coming before I, however it was undoubtedly visible and different than the previous craft.   Around 30 small intricate lights lit up overhead. the craft made no noise at all and as it passed us, the lights dimmed until the craft vanished.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

I was standing in my bathroom looking up at my skylight staring at the blue sky and out of nowhere appeared a triangle shaped aircraft. I'm assuming it was triangle shaped because of the pattern of dim amber lights that were visible. It was moving in a linear direction, west to east and passed right over head. It reminded me of the International Space Station and how it passes over head than a few seconds later it's gone. Only problem being it was daytime so it couldn't have been the ISS. I felt like it was at an altitude higher than a commercial airliner can fly. The speed it passed by it must have been going pretty fast depending on the altitude it was traveling at. Definitely was not an airplane. I've seen quite a few jets and this wasn't anything close to a commercial jet. The triangle light pattern was unmistakable.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
