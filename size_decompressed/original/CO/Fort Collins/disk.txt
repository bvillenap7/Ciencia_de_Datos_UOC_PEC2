Sighting of crescent moon shaped object at about cloud high, traveling from NNW to SSE in direction of Denver CO, at 9:30 PM. No sound.;1996-09-01 21:30:00;1 min.;SUMMARY:  Sighting of crescent moon shaped object at about cloud high, traveling from NNW to SSE in direction of Denver CO, at 9:30 PM. No sound. Two witnesses. Sitting in back yard with my wife, we were facing south watching the sky because I had seen something similar to this the previos year that my wife could not see. I looked over my right shoulder to the NNW. As I looked into totaly clear skys with bright stars this object appeared in my field of vision. Just as I saw it I said to my wife who had just turned her head, Do you see that, her reply was Oh my God I do. We both watched it proceed about cloud height above our heades and move very steadily to the SSE in the direction of Denver. I had my camera with and tryed to take pictured but they were only black when developed. As we watched it disappeared before it was at a distance that we thought it should have. It just faded out. The object appeared to be illuminated by ground lights from the city, and looked like the front edge, and bottom of a disk. It had the shape of a cresent moon, with a slight point in the center and back. There was no sound. Judging by the hight !it seemed to be around 100ft-150ft across.About a year before this we had been sitting in the same place in the yard and I saw the same thing going in the opposite direction (SSE to NNW)  that was the same shape, size, and hight, except that it had four rectangular blocks of light on the leading edge, and my wife could not see it even though she was looking exactly where I pointed. If there were any other sighting in the area around the same time, I'm interested.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

This had become our c;1996-09-01 21:30:00;45 sec;Summary : 9/1/96 SIGHTINGAround 9:30 pm, Sunday, September 1st, 1996, my wife and I were in our backyard watching the sky.  This had become our custom following a previous sighting I had seen alone in early August, 1995.  We live in Larimer County, Colorado, just south of the city limits of Fort Collins, approximately 2 miles from the foothills in front of Horsetooth Reservoir. We were positioned in such a way that our field of vision was to the south.  The sky was so clear that night that we remarked that the Milky Way was visible.  There was no moon visible at that time, although about a hour later, there was a full moon.For no apparent reason I looked over my right shoulder toward the NNW and saw clear skies.  Suddenly appearing in my field of vision was an object moving at what I guessed to be at cloud height.  There was no sound and the object moved fluidly toward the SSE, in the direction of Denver. The leading edge of the object seemed to be lit - possibly by the moon which had not yet risen but which may have been lighting the leading edge of the object from the east.    Also for no apparent reason, my wife turned her head and looked over her shoulder toward the NNW.  After having first noticed clear skies, the object suddenly appeared in her field of vision.Just at the moment that I realized what I was seeing, I said to my wife, “Do you see that?”  Before I could finish the sentence, she responded “God, I do.”As we watched the object proceed toward the SSE, we had enough time to consider and reconsider what the object might be.  The object moved with the fluidity of a bird riding a thermal, but there was no evidence of any wing movement or a change in course that a thermal would create. The object was much too large to be a bird - at arms length it would take a baseball sized object to obscure its visibility.  The shape was reminiscent of the Batman symbol with a curving leading edge that almost made a half circle with a point in the center rear.  The object appeared to be more oval than round, wide rather than long, and the center point was less that half the radius of the implied oval shape.The object remained in our field of vision for 30-45 seconds, long enough to pick up, set, and focus a camera. (The prints came back black.)  There was enough time for the internal dialog of considering, “Yes, I really see this - Yes, its really there” to take place more than 4 or 5 times as we watched the object track directly overhead.  It then disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  Our field of vision was such that we should have been able to track its movement longer than the object was visible.The object seen in the earlier sighting in August, 1995, was similar in size, height and flight path with the direction of travel being the reverse course, SSE to NNW.  The leading edge was illuminated by 4 rectangular blocks of light and the previously mentioned rear center point was not noticed.  The object also appeared and disappeared in the same sudden fashion at approximately the same positions in the sky.We would be interested in knowing if anyone else had observed this or similarly shaped sightings.

My wife and I have had another sighting.  Sunday night (6/21/97) at 11:15 PM we were in the back yard watching the sky. The first thing;1997-06-21 23:30:00;7-9 sec;Summary : My wife and I have had another sighting.  Sunday night (6/21/97) at 11:15 PM we were in the back yard watching the sky. The first thing we saw was a dim light we thought was a satellite because we see them all the time. The odd thing about this one was that as we watched it, it would get VERY bright and then fade to a dim light about every 10 sec. It did not seem to be as high as we normally see satellites. Julie began to count the approx. seconds between the bright and dim cycles. It appeared overhead and we watched it until it disappeared in the North. We are not sure if this was anything but a satellite.At 11:30 PM Julie began saying,look at that,look at that! I looked up towards the West and saw a squadron of small disk shaped objects flying in real tight formation, traveling from West to East over our heads. The moon was almost full in the SE. It seemed that the leading edge was illuminated by the moon, giving these object the appearance of a crescent shape. I estimate that there may have been 10-15 or more of these objects. The formation was irregular, not like Air Force formation flying. We watched them fade from view to the East. There was no sound and the movement was very smooth. They were possibly around 800-1000 ft. high, (this is an approximation as the sky was totally clear).I do not know if the pulsating light and the squadron had anything to do with each other, but the cluster of crescent shapes was certainly hair raising. They were moving very fast. We only saw them for about 7-9 seconds. My wife and I have had another sighting.  Sunday night (6/21/97) at 11:15 PM we were in the back yard watching the sky.

UFO west of Fort Collins, Colorado, November 26 2013.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in SW sky.  PD));2013-11-26 18:30:00;1.5 hours;UFO west of Fort Collins, Colorado, November 26 2013 First spotted to the west, I was at College and Prospect.  It was a bright white light in the sky above the mountains.   I ran back in and grabbed my co-worker.  She had never seen one before.  I actually stopped some people by campus.  I ran home and grabbed my neighbors.  We went out to see it and watched it for another 10 minutes.  During that time, changed from bright white to yellow/gold, occasionally flashed red, grew dim and then bright, lights reflecting off of surrounding clouds.  Planes in the sky seem to be unaware of it's presence, we watch one actually fly behind the object and appear on the other side.   Started drifting really slow along the horizon and began to drop.  Got the car to drive west to try and get a better view.  Realized it was dropping behind some hills, took a detour and ran up a hill.  It was gone by the time we got there, which was around 7 PM.

A flying disk with white lights was clearly spotted through binoculars in the sunset near Rocky Mountain National Park.;2014-10-27 18:00:00;20 minutes;A flying disk with white lights was clearly spotted through binoculars in the sunset near Rocky Mountain National Park. A glowing oval was spotted in the sky at around 6 pm in the sunset. I am guessing it was around the Estes Park area but may have been as close as Taft Street between Fort Collins and Loveland Colorado, and was about as high up as a small 2 person plane would be.  It appeared to be rotating and had white lights. After looking through binoculars it had a clear disk shape and with white lights around the top between the disk and bulb. The surface of the disk was smooth and silver or white. It hovered in the air a while but then disappeared completely from site leaving a small black smoke cloud in its place. A few seconds later a large black aircraft appeared in the same location. I could not get a good visual of it as it was bouncing around. This was very strange as the size of it seemed too large to be moving around so fast.I have no idea where it came from or where it went but it was gone in a matter of seconds. After it disappeared another thick black smoke c! loud appeared in the location I spotted both unidentified flying objects and then dissipated. The object did not show up in pictures due to the sun, but the black smoke cloud did after both objects disappeared.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Object in sky turned lights on, while hovering in one spot.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-26 18:30:00;4 minutes;Object in sky turned lights on, while hovering in one spot. We were driving down College Ave by Jax Surplus, when we saw an object just sitting in the sky pretty lowly.  It only had two lights on, and as we drove under it, all of the lights turned on and it stayed a bit longer.  We looked back and it had disappeared.
