3 discs in V formation rotating in sun, and changing formation of  foothills of Fort Collins Co.,;2005-06-30 11:45:00;10 min;3 discs in V formation rotating in sun, and changing formation of  foothills of Fort Collins Co., On a perfectly cloud free day west of the city of Fort Collins Co. I obseved 3 dime size objects in a V formation. They seem to be rotating and changing formation. As they moved I could see them change brightness in the sun. At times they seem extremely shiny as they rotated. Then they formed a V pattern and started to move north, at wich point they just disappeard. It was like turning of the light. I was with a friend, and I stopped several college student walking by to see if they could see what I was seeing. They all saw the same thing. When I was 10yrs old and living in Argentina, I saw the exact same thing. Even then everyone on the street stopped and looked at the sky. Please let me know if this is of any help!!!;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

UFO moving out with jet following;2009-05-17 15:30:00;2 minutes;UFO moving out with jet following Loud military jet noise caused me to look up into the sky.  I saw a round object climbing out with a pulsation appearance.  I observed the object through binoculars as it moved away and got smaller and smaller.  It looked like a star but it was broad sunny daylight. It did not move across the sky but instead seemed to move straight up and out.   I high flying jet aircraft with con trail, came in from the west and made 90 degree turn at location of siting.  The jet came within one minute of the object moving out of visual site.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Green circle low in the sky in Fort Collins;2010-06-03 23:20:00;3 seconds;Green circle low in the sky in Fort Collins It was 11:20pm on June 3rd. I extited my front door which faces west, and I saw a bright neon green circle just above the houses. It lasted a few seconds, maybe two or three seconds.  The circle just appeared and moved a short distance across the sky, south to north, was still for just a moment and then vanished, as if it had been erased.  It was not moving as fast as a meteor would, but it was moving. From my perspective, the bright neon green circle was a few inches above the houses and moved from left to right a few inches, like two inches. This object did not have the same characteristics as a meteor.  It did not have a tail, nor did it shoot high across the sky and fade away.  Meteors are fairly easy to track because they consume more distance in the sky than this object.  As low as this object was, and that it was headed across the sky instead of a falling or having had an arc flight pattern, like meteors do, it could not have possibly come from the atmosphere.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
White circler object following a commercial airliner.;2011-08-11 12:35:00;5 minutes;White circler object following a commercial airliner. I was sitting down eating my lunch that afternoon when I looked up and saw a jet passing overhead.  It was a very clear day with out any clouds in the sky.  I would say that the commercial airliner was about 5,000 feet above the ground.  I noticed that behind (and above) the airliner was a white circle following it.  I would estimate that the object was around one eight of the size of the airliner.  I would say the object was also less than 500 feet behind and above the jet. I watched the circler object following the airliner for about four minutes.  The white circler object then suddenly changed directions and started going in the opposite direction.  It just stopped moving forward and started going 180 degrees in the opposite direction!  I then watched it for another minute or two then it seemed to just disappear.

50-60 bright white circular lights, with 10-12 evenly spaced vertically on each of 5 evenly spaced towers (variable flashing;2018-02-18 17:47:00;2-3 minutes;50-60 bright white circular lights, with 10-12 evenly spaced vertically on each of 5 evenly spaced towers (variable flashing). Around sunset, I was taking a walk with my dog on the northwest edge of Fort Collins, behind Lincoln Middle School, on the far north edge of the athletic fields.  Just beyond here, the terrain drops down abruptly to the north into the Cache la Poudre River valley, thus providing an unobstructed view to the north and northeast.  I was preoccupied with some beautiful orange sunlit clouds over the mountains to the west, taking a couple pictures of these clouds on my iphone at 17:46 and 17:47, and thinking about sending one of these pictures and a text to a friend.  I could have first noticed the strange lights before I took the first picture, between the two pictures, or perhaps just after the second picture. The UFO I'm reporting didn't look as if it was flying at all, but rather appeared as an array of about 50-60 unidentified bright white circular lights to my north-northeast.  The array consisted of 5 vertical strings of about 10-12 lights evenly spaced on each string.  The 5 strings of vertically arranged lights were evenly spaced horizontally and apparently extended to the ground, giving the appearance of 50-60 spotlights mounted on 5 towers.  The lights looked uniform in their size, white color, and brightness.  I think all lights were on when I first noticed them.  Then over a period of perhaps 1-2 minutes, the lights on a given tower would all turn off and quickly back on, in a repeated pattern where the rightmost tower of lights would flash off-on, followed sequentially by next tower's lights flashing off-on, continuing to the left-most tower, and with that sequence repeating several times (like some kind of stadium lighting light show).  With this right-to-left off-on sequencing continuing, the off period of each tower's lights began to progressively get a little longer before coming back on, with 2 then 3 towers being off simultaneously, until finally all lights remained off.  It had the appearance of a 2-3 minute shutdown sequence from all lights being on.  It was too dark to see any kind of towers that the lights may have been mounted on.  I noted that it was 17:50 shortly after the lights remained off.  I think official sunset was 17:40, several minutes after the sun had set over the mountains.  The reason I didn't immediately pay attention to these lights is I was preoccupied with my cloud pictures and subconsciously assumed the lights were on the NIST WWVB phased array towers north of Fort Collins (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWVB).  These towers were 5-6 miles north-northeast of my location, in the same general direction as I saw the lights.  However, as I began noticing the strange sequencing of off-on light patterns, I realized that these didn't look like the NIST towers, which as I remembered and confirmed as they appeared more clearly as it got darker after the unidentified lights remained off, don't look evenly spaced from afar and which have only 1 or 2 red lights on each tower.  After the unidentified lights remained off, the impression I had of the 5 towers of lights is that they were closer and extended to a higher angular height than the NIST towers, were a little to the right of where the NIST towers were, were evenly spaced as opposed to! the unevenly spaced (when viewed from my vantage) NIST towers, and the unidentified white lights were bigger and much brighter than the red NIST lights.  I've lived in Fort Collins for 37 years and have never noticed the NIST towers with bright white lights.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Two Bright Lights With No Stars in the Sky;2018-09-01 18:30:00;1 hour;Two Bright Lights With No Stars in the Sky At about 6:30 PM myself and 4 others witnessed two very bright white lights in the sky to the Southwest.  These two objects moved very little in the beginning and when they did they stayed parallel to one another.  A couple times in the duration of watching them they moved further apart  and closer together, yet stayed a mirror image to each other in formation.  At times they appeared to have a slight color variation, ranging from yellow, to blue, to green, to red, to purple.   Now at about 15 minutes into our sighting, I was able to look through a a scope and see each of them at different times much closer and clearer.  Though they were both definitely different objects they were similar in appearance.  Using the scope I determined the general shape of each object was actually round.  To me they looked like a bubble such as kids play with.  I had difficulty holding the scope still enough until about 45 minutes later when I had a solid surface I could actually see up close what appeared to be a myriad of individual white lights flashing on the craft!   At about this time my neck could take no more as the object I was focusing on was almost directly overhead now and it was getting dark.  By the time I was able to come back stars were out and I could no longer locate the objects.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
2 bright orbs in evening sky over Colorado (Labor Day);2018-09-01 19:00:00;>1 hour;2 bright orbs in evening sky over Colorado (Labor Day) Two individuals came to our home to pick up a chair that we were giving away.  I was sitting inside the house, my mom, my brother, and the two guests were outside loading the chair onto the vehicle.  My mom claims that she looked up and saw these two fairly bright lights in the air.  She came in and told me to come outside, and I looked up and I saw them too.  They were parallel to one another near perfectly, and looked like they were getting closer to one another.  They'd be horizontally parallel, then somewhat slanted but still parallel, and then vertically parallel (they cycled slowly between these).   We watched them for a fair bit of time.  I ended up going inside, and my mom and brother watched them for a while longer.  At some point, I went in to the backyard, where my brother was tending to the grill, and still watching the lights.  They had grown much farther apart and ascended higher into the atmosphere and were harder to see. I do have both video and pictures of this.  I plan on sending the pictures in, if the video is asked for, I'll provide it as well.   My mother also has pictures and I think video.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

Two very bright and large circular objects spotted in the western sky in close proximity to each other.  The objects were much too large, bright, and circular to be stars, planets, or aircrafts.   The two objects, over the course of an hour moved fairly rapidly in opposition directions.   As they moved away from each other, they got smaller and dimmer until they completely disappeared.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143

There was a pause so I called my son out to see. Just as he arrived to the car they started coming again and again. Then one high beamed right above us all. We stood in shock as many others formed a long long long train of objects. We're going back out at EXACTLY 10pm to see what's going on at that time.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
