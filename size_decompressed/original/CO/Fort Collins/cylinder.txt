On my way to work going North on I-70 from Fort Collins Colorado to Cheyenne Wyoming.;2007-03-20 01:00:00;10 minutes;On my way to work going North on I-70 from Fort Collins Colorado to Cheyenne Wyoming. Noticed a very bright white light in the distance while driving that seemed to be slowly getting closer as I drove.   As it got closer I could see green, red and purple sparks coming out of the rear of the vessel, (I still noticed the bright white light on the bottom but it wasn't a spotlight like on aircraft, just a very bright light that you couldn't tell if it was mounted or part of the sparking it was in the middle of the sparking) at an altitude of only around 500-1000 feet to my west as I was driving Northbound.   I stopped my car and pulled over to the shoulder as I watched it slowly glide by without ANY sound at all I watched as it went over Fort Collins and out of sight.  It was on the news for only a brief time then no more was heard of it.   I immediately called my boss in Cheyenne and asked if he had seen anything .. He explained exactly what I had seen myself, so I know I wasn't seeing things.  Other vehicles had pulled over in both my lane and the oncoming lanes, as well.   I know of nothing both civilian or military that emits sparks like that, (beautiful colors and very bright as well) that can make zero noise and had no semblance of any cockpit that one could see, it was that close to the ground..  I approximate it's airspeed at around 100 knots because I could easily watch it as it came into close view and then went by and then watched as it went out of sight again..  It was said, I think, on the news that it was some type of military aircraft that went down.  Might have crashed somewhere South of Loveland, Colorado or Longmont...  Not sure exactly.  I was wondering if anyone else had reported it..  I don't know any one who did. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
