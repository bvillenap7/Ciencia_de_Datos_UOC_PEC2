I saw the phoenix lights over ft.collins colorado;2004-03-20 20:45:00;15 sec.;I saw the phoenix lights over ft.collins colorado -on march 20 at aprox. 8:45pm  Me and a friend, were standing between two buildings in a fairly lit part of town.  the buildings blocked out most of the city light so i could see the night sky fairly well.  We saw a chevron shaped (that's v shaped) object moving slowly across the sky.  It was about two or three inches across in my visual spectrum and seemed to be very high, at least 10,000 ft if not more.  it looked like 7 dim lights in a v formation with one more in the center.  the lights were just bright enough to see but not bright enough to really catch your attention. i just happened to catch the movement.  It was so big that I'm sure it was not a jet, and it was completely silent. it seemed to be leaving a wake of  light trails behind it that resembled heat inversion or the waviness you see when pumping gas on a hot day.  it moved very slow as if it were floating rather than flying.  one of my girlfriends co-workers saw the same thing from across town so I can safely say that my friend and I were not just seeing things.  it looked exactly like the phoenix lights phenomena that was witnessed in colorado springs and arizona in 1997.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Chevron glider cloaked to match stars glides for 15 seconds 40 feet from ground then disappears;2015-09-18 21:30:00;15 seconds;Chevron glider cloaked to match stars glides for 15 seconds 40 feet from ground then disappears We were climbing the side of the engineering building at Colorado State University at 9:30 pm on Friday the 18th, 2015, when out of the corner of my eye I saw a chevron shaped flying object glide over head.  I immediately yelled to my friend do you see that?!  I jumped off the building and we saw the flying object continue to glide over and past the building heading south. It was gliding at a slow speed (maybe 10 to 15 mph) around 40 to 50 feet off the ground. It was a chevron v shape flying object that looked almost like it was projecting stars on the bottom, like a chameleon cloaking device so that it would not be noticed.  We could still make out the broad outline and movement of the outline as the stars it projected did not match with the sky as the sky was slightly overcast with only a few stars showing.  It looked to have a 20 foot wingspan.  It made no noise what so ever.  The night was dead quite, we could not even hear any wind from it gliding.   After gliding for 15 seconds since I first spotted it out of the corner of my eye, it disappeared.  There was no flash of light like it was taking off, it just completely disappeared.   We spent the rest of the night looking for it in the sky, but never spotted it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Was watching the meteor shower from a field at the end of the road. ~ 4AM an object flew overhead which had 5 lights in a V formation.;2016-08-13 04:00:00;~5 seconds;I was watching the meteor shower from a field at the end of the road.  About 4AM, an object flew overhead which had 5 lights in a V formation.  It made no sound I could detect.  It flew horizontal SE, then a quick turn nearly vertical and returned horizontal continuing in the SE direction.   I could not make out a body, only the lights but where the body should have been it seemed to refract (is that the right word?) light.  The stars behind the object shifted a bit as if they were placed under water and then once it had passed returned to where they were.   I have no evidence of anything, my phone was dead, and even if it weren't, the whole thing happened in a matter of seconds.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Green lights in chevron form flying over Fort Collins, CO.;2017-01-18 23:30:00;5-10 seconds;Green lights in Chevron form flying over Fort Collins, CO. I was letting my roommate's dog outside, when I saw a group of fluorescent green lights in the form of a chevron.  This was observed a few minutes after 23:30 MST approximately 4 blocks south of CSU Fort Collins campus.  The event lasted for 5 to 10 seconds.  It was a clear night with no clouds, stars were visible.  I was the only witness who saw this. I am a senior at Colorado State studying Civil Engineering and have a good understanding of physics, optics, and trigonometry. There were 5 to 7 lights in the formation, and were first seen 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. I was looking south when I first sighted them, and watched them move north almost directly overhead they were 20 degrees from vertical to the east of me.  As the chevron passed over head, it started accelerating and gaining altitude, before the lights disappeared 40 to 50 degrees above the horizon looking north.  The lights were observed for a total of 100 to 120 degrees in the sky.  As the lights passed from south to north, they changed shape from a chevron into a straight line.  I live on a N-S-E-W street grid, and I can determine that the lights were traveling within 10 degrees of the N-S axis. From the observation point, the lights appeared relatively small, but much larger than a star.  The individual lights were round, with a hazy edge and appeared to be about 1/6 the size of the moon.  The chevron formation had a span of 3 moons, and stayed approximately this size for the entire duration, as they changed shape.  As the object passed overhead, it made no sounds.  The dog I was letting out did not respond to the event. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be eloquent, and sober-minded.  In part, because of his technical training, we suspect he is a very capable witness.  He has submitted a very nice graphic, which illustrates the sighting, and which is posted to the NUFORC website.
