Neon Green Flash Crashes South of Fort Collins.;2012-11-08 22:30:00;2 seconds;Neon Green Flash Crashes South of Fort Collins I was driving south on US-287 just south of Fort Collins around 22:30 MST and I noticed a green light flash across the sky slightly east of my direction of travel for aprox. 2 seconds.   The light had a trajectory similar to a meteor burning up in the atmosphere, but was a distinctly neon green color and was substantially larger.   My first thought was some sort of firework that ignited late, but its speed was also similar to something crashing to Earth.   The direction of travel was from East to West and looked to intersect my southbound direction of travel.  I, however, saw no signs after the flash indicating what happened.   The shape of the light I would describe as similar to the booster rocket assemblies used for Discovery and other spacecraft, except traveling in reverse.   I heard no noise (my car has substantial engine noise), smelled nothing other than my heater (it was cold), and felt nothing ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Orange Fireball at 0230 in Ft Collins Co, traveling parallel to the ground surface;2016-04-24 02:30:00;1 minute;Orange Fireball at 0230 in Ft Collins Co, traveling parallel to the ground surface While on duty As a Security Officer at 0230 Noticed an orange what looked like a Fireball traveling from East to West parallel to the ground.  First noticed what I felt was a low level high speed Military Air craft in the distance, then as it got closer it appeared as an orange fireball with a white vapor trail that just vanished.  Again this was always traveling parallel to the ground surface.  I wasn't going to report this but this is the strange part:  For some unknown reason our Security duty phone which is on the Verizon Network started acting up with Verizon not understanding what the cause was.  This is a phone we use every night, hourly for security reporting.  Other security offices reported when it was called it went straight to voice mail.  The Network never noticed the calls, and the phone never showed, missed calls.  It was tested with at times six to eight calls going straight to voicemail but the actual device never noticed the calls.  The phone is the latest and greatest, this has never occurred prior to this event sighting.  At the same time our Company CYCOP computer which is a mobile GPS reporting device RESET.  It did function the rest of the shift.  However, at 0600 our phone was still having unknown issues with Verizon reporting, NTF, no trouble found. I would like to close by saying as for my background, I was raised on Air Force bases, I know Military Air Craft, and was a high ranking consultant for both the DOD, and civilian communication issues.  I also know Stan Gorden since I was involved with a 1965 UFO incident (on site) in Pa.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
