Smooth, silent  and quickly moving formation of orange disks.;1982-05-07 16:30:00;1-2 minutes;Smooth, silent  and quickly moving formation of orange disks. It looked very much like a normal formation (V pattern) of military jets except that each one seemed to be just a bright orange disk.  They didn't make a sound and appeared (not knowing their size) to be fairly low (1000 feet..?). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

We watched 30+ lights in a line formation but in pairs.  ((Starlink satellites??))((anonymous));2020-03-04 20:23:00;15 minutes;I was taking a walk with my son, since it was such a nice night. Anyway, I looked up to look at the stars and Immediately noticed the lights. I freaked out because there was so many lights. After I calmed down, I had called a fellow trusted friend to run outside to confirm this. Keep in mind, he had to get dressed.Sure enough, while we talked for another 10 mins we watched 30+ lights in a line formation but in pairs. So 2 lines of these lights. The lights would eventually just turn off. Coming from southwest to northeast.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
