Red-lighted UFO with bluish flashing light flits over vacant field.;1993-08-19 21:10:00;5 minutes;Red-lighted UFO with bluish flashing light flits over vacant field. The following account is taken from a personal report made soon after the sighting:  As I was driving east on Prospect Road in Fort Collins, Colorado toward Interstate 25, I noticed a large bright red light or bunch of lights flying about 100 feet above the ground off to my left (north).  The craft would periodically flash a bluish-white light as it sort of hovered around.  The thing wasn't going fast enough to be an airplane, and the way it dropped altitude one time didn't seem like a helicopter, either.  It more floated than flew.  I did not hear any sound, but I was in a moving 11-passenger van.  The object, which was very bright, was only a couple hundred yards away, and mostly red.  After turning north onto I-25, I saw the same or similar object a few minutes later, moving south.  I didn't stop to investigate the craft more closely, since I had passengers to deliver back to Wyoming, all of whom seemed to ignore the object.  I did not mention it to them.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
blinking light on the road for a few minutes then stopped. No lights on houses around.;2005-03-20 23:00:00;10 Minutes;blinking light on the road for a few minutes then stopped. No lights on houses around. I was coming down a hill and before i got to the end I saw a light, like a spot light in the migle of the road so I pulled off and watched it for a minute. It was cloudy that nite so I did not see where the light was coming from but, it blinked a few times then it just stop. I looked to see if any houses around had a light blinking but there was none.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Object sited near Fort Collins, CO;2008-10-26 05:27:00;20 seconds;Object sited near Fort Collins, CO On Sunday, 10/26/08 at 05:27, I noticed a bright light in the North Eastern sky moving East.  At first, I assumed it was a satellite, but then the light moved to the right, then to the left and then moved backwards.   It continued to track in a Easterly direction, then moved to the left, then backwards again then moved to the East again.   I lost sight of the light roughly 20 seconds after I first noticed it.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
Upon leaving a friends house around 10:30pm, we walked outside the front door (facing east coming outside) and noticed a blinking light;2019-12-19 22:28:00;1.5min;Upon leaving a friends house around 10:30pm, we walked outside the front door (facing east coming outside) and noticed a blinking light in the sky which was about 2miles away and around 300-400ft off the ground headed in our direction. The light was blinking red, white, and green in the same arythmic display as a modern commercial airplane, but very bright, much brighter than normal craft. However I passed this off as a plane, being an 8yr airforce vet I was around all sorts of aircraft and nothing caught my attention of being abnormal.  But then the aircraft banked left very hard, not a curved or even slightly tight bank that of a small single engine or even that of a helicopter, but an almost 90Â°degree turn and speed up very quickly heading north. The object continued to speed up and then banked left again heading west. It did not slow down or take a wide turn, this time it was a direct 90 degree turn. It traveled west for about 1mile in the matter of seconds. At this time the craft came to a dead stop. And when I mean dead stop I mean from a couple hundred miles an hour to complete stop with ZERO deceleration before stopping.  At this time the my wife and son are very afraid and get in the car begging me to get in. I am personally just in complete awe and excitement because I have never witnessed something behave in this nature. To me this was completely impossible and only something you see through CGI in movies.  The craft sat in place for about 5seconds and then continued heading west again slowly at first but picking up speed. I would estimate the craft traveled another mile before stopping completely in place yet again for maybe half a second then turned left again heading south at the same speed it was before it stopped. It then traveled for another 3-400yds very quickly before coming to a dead stop again and hovering in place for another 10sec.  It slowly headed west for maybe 100yds and then banked right, heading north, leaving my line of sight behind the house in front of us. I jumped in the car and tried to get my wife to follow it. Her and my son were extremely scared and worried and she ignored my wishes to try and follow the object. I never gained sight of the objec6 again.;40.5540797142859;-105.064242857143
