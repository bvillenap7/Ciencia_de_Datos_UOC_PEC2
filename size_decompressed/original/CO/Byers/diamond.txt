Diamond shaped craft north and east of Byers, Colorado.  ((anonymous report));2018-04-01 22:00:00;15 minutes;Diamond shaped craft north and east of Byers, Colorado. Heard a jet fly over that sounded like it was above my house, and I wondered if a DIA flight pattern changed.  Heard it again in a few minutes.   The third time when I heard it, I ran outside and it was a diamond shaped aircraft with no round fuselage.  Color appeared to be black.  It did have a tail like a normal jet.  Could not see top, only saw bottom and side.   It was heading NE like it was heading from Denver or the mountains, then turned east.  I'm guessing about 2000 feet above ground.  From the rear of the craft, was a white light on the left and a red light on the right with smaller white lights (three or four) in the center.  The lights were blinking.  Speed of the craft was like that of a regular airliner.   Loudness was high because of the closeness to the ground.
