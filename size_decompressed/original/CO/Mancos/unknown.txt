Unidentified tracks near 5 households appear overnight;2012-11-11 22:30:00;unknown;Unidentified tracks near 5 households appear overnight On the night of Sunday the 11th my neighbor noticed strange tracks in her driveway.  The following day she called me to know if I had seen anything strange. In my driveway I found a multitude of single line tracks in the gravel of my yard some of which came right up to my house.  We checked with our other neighbors and found that in total 5 households within a 1/2 mile had been &quotvisited&quot by the same single tracked entity.  I called to find out if someone had surveyed our area recently but there are no human foot prints associated with the straight line tracks we have observed  (Some of these are in soft dirt and snow and there are no associated prints or tread marks within the tracks) which resemble a heavy ball rolling up and down hill.  These tracks are very smooth and some enter very small areas ( between fence posts and under downspouts) and move with precision.  We have pictures and maps of all the tracks we could find.;37.3501;-108.2987
