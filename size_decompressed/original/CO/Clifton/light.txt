I noticed a dim white light high in the sky and figured it was a helicopter or something.  As I drove closer, I began to realize that it wasn't a helicopter or plane, or anything I'd seen before.  I kept driving in the direction of the light, and I noticed it descending and approaching the ground.  I turned off the main road and headed East, but that's when I noticed the light was following me and getting closer.  As it grew closer, I was able to see it more closely.  It was four diffused lights, swirling around as if chasing one another in circles.  They did not have definite shapes, like lightbulbs would, but the lights seemed to swirl and liquify and move in inconsistant, constantly changing blob-patterns.  I rolled down my window and waved, and the lights caught up to my car and we were traveling side-by-side (though the lights were in the sky, and I was on the road).   I took several more turns, now onto a backroad, but the lights followed. Somewhere along the way, one of the lights must have taken off, because when I looked back, there were only three lights following me.  I finally made it to my house and ran inside to get my roommates (to make sure I wasn't seeing things). The four of us (roommates) went outside.  Everyone claimed to see it at the time, though now one of my roommates denies that she saw it. One by one, my roommates went back inside the house while I stayed outside and watched it for probably 15 more minutes.  I noticed it getting further away now, heading West and rising higher in the sky.  As it got further, the lights stretched and combined, forming a thin, bright, horizontal light.  Then there was a bright green flash and afterwards, the light was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.0789;-108.4514
I SAW A LARGE OBJECT WITH TWO LIGHTS MOVING AROUND IN THE SKY;2008-09-28 20:27:00;1 minute;I SAW A LARGE OBJECT WITH TWO LIGHTS MOVING AROUND IN THE SKY WE FIRST SAW A LIGHT STREAK ACROSS THE SKY, AND THEN SAW 2 VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS SLOWLY  FALLING TOWARDS THE GROUND. AFTER ABOUT 15 SECONDS IT STOPPED FALLING AND STARTED MOVING AWAY FROM US HEADING NORTH AND WENT UP UNTIL WE WERE UNABLE TO SEE IT ANYMORE. THE LIGHTS WERE WHITE, AND APPEARED TO BE ON EACH SIDE OF A LARGE FOGGY SHAPE. WE COULD NOT MAKE OUT AN OUTLINE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE VERY LARGE ( POSSIBLY A MILE OR MORE ACROSS ) ,AND AS IT MOVED WE COULD NOT SEE THE STARS BEHIND IT. MY WIFE,SISTER IN LAW AND I WERE SITTING IN OUR BACK YARD AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING AND NONE OF US HAD EVER SEEN ANY THING LIKE THIS. THERE HAD BEEN AN AIR SHOW HERE IN GRAND JUNCTION THAT DAY, BUT NO AIRCRAFT WERE IN THE SKY AT THE TIME WE SAW THE OBJECT. THE AIR SHOW HAD ENDED IN THE AFTERNOON.;39.0789;-108.4514
