While riding off-road motorcycles high in the mountians above Silverton, I too a few pictures of my riding buddies and the scenery.  When developed,ne frame clearly shows two cigar shaped objects, highlighted by the sunlight on one side, black in the middle and green on the other side.  The objects look to be identical. ((NUFORC Note:  The photograph shows two stick-shaped objects, with tapered ends, suspended in a daytime, cloudless sky.  We do not know what the objects are.  PD));37.8078;-107.6649
