I was watching cloud this evening looking south toward Longs Peak from my picture window.   Large puffy high clouds mostly.  Then I noticed a smaller cloud more to the south west but still high in the sky.  The sun was still pretty high over the mountains to the west and was shining brightly.  While looking at this cloud an oval shaped disk dropped out of the cloud and hung motionless in the air for about 15 seconds.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Then it started to move westward and in an instant was gone.;40.3658;-105.5142
