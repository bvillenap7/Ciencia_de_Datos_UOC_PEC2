A bright, fast moving light is chased by a military fighter jet.;1975-07-15 20:30:00;15 seconds;A bright, fast moving light is chased by a military fighter jet. On a clear evening around dusk in July, 1975, I was traveling south on State Highway 7 near Long’s Peak Inn, between Estes Park and Allenspark, in Larimer County, Colorado. I saw a small, bright round object or light going from east to west at extreme speed. It crossed over the road about half a mile south of our position.  A second or two later I saw a military fighter jet that appeared to be following the object on the same trajectory.  The jet was moving at a much slower rate of speed by comparison. Both the object and the jet were high enough to reflect the sun that had, from our point of view, already gone down behind Long’s Peak whose summit is 14,256’ above sea level.  Both object and jet disappeared from view after they crossed over the mountains. I was with my husband and my teen-aged nephew, both of whom saw the object and the military jet. I am presently a psychoanalyst in private practice.  Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S.  Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.  I consider myself to be a curious, careful and scientifically oriented observer.  My husband was a civil engineer.;40.3658;-105.5142
Estes Park, CO, green/red lights hovering in close formation.;2016-07-10 22:30:00;20 minutes;Estes Park, CO, green/red lights hovering in close formation. 4 green lights in close formation, alternating to red lights, then back to green, hovering over ridge to the southwest of our location, then slowly moving sideways, up an down, away, then back again, somewhat erratically.  We watched this for about 15 to 20 minutes.  The lights then sped off to the west, and we could see them just above the horizon for about another 15 minutes.  These lights seemed to be roughly 5 or so miles away and about 2000 feet above the ridge line.;40.3658;-105.5142
