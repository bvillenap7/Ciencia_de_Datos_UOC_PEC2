Red object moving fast, high, hovering over mountain ridge in CO.;2017-11-12 17:40:00;<5 minutes;Red object moving fast, high, hovering over mountain ridge in CO. My husband and I were seated in our living room, in the dark, shortly before 6 PM.  Our chairs face generally north, overlooking what is called “Lumpy Ridge” in Estes Park, CO.  He asked me if I saw the red light over the ridge, which brought my attention to it.  He watched it move quickly west, then east, and it came to a stop as I spotted it.  It hovered for several seconds, then sped off to the east and disappeared from our windows’ view. My spouse commented that it was too high and moved too fast to be a plane, a drone, a helicopter.  In addition, he said he saw no light except the red (the entire object was red).  His understanding is that FAA approved aircraft had to have different colored lights on port, starboard, and at the rear.  If this one had those, we would have seen lights with colors other than red as it turned directions.  Instead, we only saw the one color, which would indicate that it was flying back and forward without turning, and he could not imagine a craft that could do that.  Looked too high and fast to be a drone purchased off Amazon.  Not sure what we saw, and if my husband’s impressions about required lighting on approved crafts is accurate.  First time we’ve seen something like this.;40.3658;-105.5142
