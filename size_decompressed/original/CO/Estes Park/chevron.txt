The object was at approximately 300 to 500 feet in elevation and traveling southwest to northeast. I would guess the size to be approximately that of the wing span of a boeing 727. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be hightly credible.  We would welcome reports from anyone else who may have seen this object.  PD));40.3658;-105.5142
