I was stargazing with a friend at our remote mountain cabin.  No moon, very clear night with lots of stars.  We noticed a trianglular shape of stars inside the cup of the big dipper about 1/4 the size of the big dipper.   The triangle shape moved from north to south with the point of the triangle leading at a fairly slow steady speed.  There was no noise.  We watched it track to the south for about 2 minutes, and then it just faded away.;38.125;-105.4301
