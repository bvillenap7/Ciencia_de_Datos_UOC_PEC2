Blue circular object with small whitish arms(?);2021-01-03 00:00:00;1 minute;Blue circular object with small whitish arms(?) Object spotted above our property - south of the town of Westcliffe Colorado,  around Jan 2nd, 2021 (guess could've been 3rd).  I was using binoculars staring straight up at somewhere near the milky way, probably midnight or later.  A blue circular object enlarged toward me (apparently) and slowly rotated with two whitish outwardly opposed arms in a short spiral shape.  It had to be quite high since I was focused towards the milky way, and it was perhaps only visible with binoculars.  I could only think, wow, an angel.  But my technical mind thought more like it was a satellite maneuver captured from below?  But the intensity of the blue circular color seemed to be too bright to be a thruster of some kind.  I was for a time looking into the possibility that it was a high altitude test of water release into the upper atmosphere, but it was too clean of a circle.  Then I considered Electric Hall Sensor thrusters, which look blue and circular when 'burning'. But I was wrong again, since the size would have been way too large for that kind of thruster.  (when considering the distance this thing was viewed at).  I have yet to find any clue if it was man made, or some kind of supernova?  It was only visible for a short time (less than minute?), then appeared to almost rotate out of view - to me it may have been a cone shape, only by the way it disappeared through the binoculars - but that's a guess.  (As in looking into a cone's large end and then rotating the cone to the side - virtually disappearing from view). But this was bright and blue with what looked like a round core object centered inside.  There were lines projecting outward from this core.  I could only draw an image of it. Sorry I had no way to capture it, and did not record time or coordinates.;38.125;-105.4301
