Wife and I had gone camping on our property, and arrived at 01:15.  While setting up, I noticed this bright light to the southeast.  I identified Jupiter and decided that this was not what we were seeing.  It appeared to change colors from white to green then red and back to whiteish green.   I noticed several small, fast aircraft heading in the direction of the light.  They appeared to be jets and were very fast.  Other commercial airliners were visibile so size comparision of small jets was easy, as was the speed they were traveling.   The object then faded into a smudge simliar to hale-bopp then came back into sharp focus.  The object also appeared to be flashing in a steady pattern if I looked at it out of the corner of my eye (perpherial vision).   I watched it for about 50 minutes, until it disappeared.;38.125;-105.4301
