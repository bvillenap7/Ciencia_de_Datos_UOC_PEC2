bright white light in night sky.;2006-11-04 18:30:00;approx 2 minutes;Bright white light in night sky. November 4, 2006  I was the passenger in a friend’s car and we were heading through town in a NNE direction at about 6:30pm M.S.T., There is a plateau on the edge of town (directly ahead of us) with a ridge which rises up behind it. Directly ahead of us in the night sky I witnessed a bright white light.  The light appeared to stay in exactly the same place in the sky. As we traveled through town I rolled the window down to get a better look at it and to see if I could hear any sound from it. It was at that time we came to a stop light and I was able to point it out to my friend who was driving.  We watched the light together for about 20 seconds and then it disappeared.  I thought I might be able to distinguish some sort of a shape because of the backlight of the moon, but the object was completely gone.  There we no other aircraft in the sky that we could see ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));37.2605344594595;-107.868331756757
bright white light slowing moving across night sky.;2007-12-15 18:20:00;approx 2 minutes;bright white light slowing moving across night sky. December 15, 2007  My 7 year old daughter and I left our house at 6:20pm heading down to a neighbors house, all of our lights were out in our house because I was in the process of plugging our Christmas lights in. In our area the night sky is really dark and occasionally you can see satellites.  I thought it would be really cool to show my daughter an orbiting satellite if I could locate one.  I was standing in front of our house (which faces directly north) and I looked in a NNE direction in the sky and I witnessed a bright white light slowly heading in a NNW direction. I watched the light for about 45 seconds to a minute when my daughter started to ask me if we could hurry up and go. I didn't want to point it out to her becuase I thought she might get a little freaked out.  As I watched the light move across the sky it faded to orange and gradually got smaller until it completely faded into the night sky and was no longer visible. After about 2 minutes the light was completely gone.  When I first noticed the light I almost thought it could have been a spotlight from a helicopter, but there was no sound and because of the mountains in the canyon we live in, my thoughts are the elevation of the light appeared to be much higher than a helicopter would normally fly.  The light gradually disappeared kind of like when you turn a clear light bulb off and the filament is still hot and glows and as it cools of it goes completely out.;37.2605344594595;-107.868331756757
Very bright light moving fast, turning red then dissapears.;2009-09-25 23:30:00;5 min;Very bright light moving fast, turning red then disappears. Every night we sit outside when the weather permits us to do so. For the past few nights now we have seen a very bright light moving across the northwest sky. The light seens to be moving at a high rate of speed. We watch it for about 3 to 5 min. then it will turn red and its gone.;37.2605344594595;-107.868331756757
Two moving lights over north-central New Mexico 7:36 pm Tue Oct 6 2009;2009-10-06 19:36:00;3 min;Two moving lights over north-central New Mexico 7:36 pm Tue Oct 6 2009 My partner and I were seated outdoors observing the south sky almost an hour after sunset. We were waiting for moon rise.  Jupiter was bright in the south sky, but other stars were still dim. I looked up and noticed two stars as bright and large as Jupiter about 15 to 20 degrees above the SSE horizon, and asked where did those stars come from?  They were about 1-2 degrees apart, somewhat more than the distance between the stars/nebula in Orion's belt. My partner asked if they were moving - and I could see they were moving in parallel in a southerly direction, when tracked against another nearby star. They remained bright for another minute or two, then gradually dimmed in unison, and disappeared.  They appeared to be objects at high altitude, picking up the sun's reflection, and large enough to resemble Jupiter (not small like a satellite). There were no blinking lights and no indication the objects were lighted themselves, just brightly reflecting the sun's light.  If sighted by anyone else, these objects may be reported as flying over north central New Mexico.  I suppose they could have been two airplanes flying in tandem at very high altitude, both brightly reflecting the late sun rays, but it would have been unusual to see two commercial planes flying in the same direction so close to each other.;37.2605344594595;-107.868331756757
On August 13, 2010 in Durango, CO. at approximately 10 PM my husband and I were out on our deck observing the Showers of Perseus when w;2010-08-13 22:00:00;5 mins;On August 13, 2010 in Durango, CO. at approximately 10 PM my husband and I were out on our deck observing the Showers of Perseus when we noticed a lighted object in the eastern sky traveling quite rapidly from south to north.  At first we thought it might be a satellite but it was moving much faster than other satellites we had seen.  We live in a wooded mountain area with no ambient light to obstruct the sky.  The object appeared to be round but was too far to be certain.  Suddenly the object stopped and emitted a bright light blueish/white in color for about 10 seconds.  After the bright light went out the object continued quickly moving north and disappeared from our line of sight;37.2605344594595;-107.868331756757
Amber lights flying about in night sky.;2012-07-20 23:00:00;1.5 hours;Amber lights flying about in night sky I am reporting this because I heard on Coast to Coast AM that these types of sighting have been growing and you would like any reports.   This happened in a very rural area outside of Durango, no lights other than farm houses on the horizon and a very clear night.  My fiancé and I were driving home down a long stretch of dirt road and noticed three amber/orange light at about a 45 degree angle from us.  The three light were angled at a 45 degree angle as well diagonally.   We initially thought it was a crane or something, and were utterly confused as it was a rural area.   As we got closer the light began to move horizontally.  We then watched the light from our front porch.  They were hovering over where a small mountain was (with nothing on top).  They would shoot back and forth across the sky and at one point one converged with another and then shot out so fast it made me jump back in reaction.   There were approx. 6 lights at the most, 3 more than what we originally saw.  If I remember right, after about an hour we had to go to bed so we never saw them disappear.  I just with I could have filmed this, because it was so bazaar.   Also, we could hear hovering-almost a buzzing sound.   This was our first ever sighting and very freaky!   As a side note, one of my really good friends posted on a facebook almost the exact same experience and sighting, (only about 120 miles- in Arizona) away from our sighting about a week later.  I thought this could not be a coincidence! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));37.2605344594595;-107.868331756757
