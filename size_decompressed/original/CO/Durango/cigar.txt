cigar shaped craft hovering over mountains;2009-03-05 09:27:00;3-5 minutes;cigar shaped craft hovering over mountains I was driving towards durango west on highway 160 when i noticed what at first looked like an airplane really close to the mountains in front of me but as i looked i realized it was moving really slow and where there should be wings there wasn't any, just a ring of darker color around the ship it was cigar shaped white with a darker color midsection but it wasn't exactly in the middle it was 1/4 of the ship.. it was very close to the top of the mountain  ( or hill) and it seemed to linger and stop i watched it while driving then i remembered to look at the time and i grabed my phone to see if i could record it as i made the last curve on my way up yello jacket pass it was gone. i could see airplanes in the distance and i've seen planes up close before but that wasn't what this was.  this is a similiar craft i've seen with others on the other side of wolf creek pass gowing down hwy 285;37.2605344594595;-107.868331756757
