I was took a photo of a wispy cloud formation and an almost full moon in the blue afternoon sky.  5 days later when I downloaded the photo I saw a small line in it.  I thought it was the monitor dirt, or something from the camera lense.  I did a zoom in and saw the clear-ish dome on top of it!  The whole picture was slightly blurry of course, but you can see the saucer shape and the dome shape - and maybe wheels on either end of the bottom.  If you enlarge the photo you can also see white (it gets pixelated) underneath it. The weird thing is that in another part of the sky there's another artifact -completely foreign shaped, like a Romulan ship (with pointed arms) in some kind of maneuver- since it's really small I can't tell much about it.  Definitely not something on the lense though.;37.2605344594595;-107.868331756757
