Two objects that brighten to 1st magnitude, and dim, to be no longer visible in southeast sky.;2015-11-02 18:15:00;4 minutes;Two objects that brighten to 1st magnitude and dim to be no longer visible in southeast sky From 6 pm or earlier, my husband and I sat on our deck viewing the southeastern sky during twilight from our deck.   Around 6:14 pm two objects (appearing starlike) began to gradually increase in brightness in proximity to Neptune's current location and about 3 degrees north of Fomalhaut (1st magnitude star in Piscis, according to my iphone app Star Guide.)   The two objects were about 1 degree apart and gradually brightened to become the brightest objects in the twilight sky, then dimmed until they were no longer visible by naked eye.  The visibility period lasted about 3 to 4 minutes, from 6:14 to 6:18.  They did not appear to change location.   Perhaps these were two fixed satellites that momentarily caught sunlight.  But I am not sure.;37.2605344594595;-107.868331756757

The object appeared to be similar to a bioluminescent jelly fish.  The object pulsated red and purple colors in no obvious pattern.  At one point, it shot out an amber colored object.  In my opinion, the object normally would have been invisible to the naked eye, however, because the sun was close to rising, the object was unable to fully compensate for the light and dark with camouflage.;37.2605344594595;-107.868331756757
