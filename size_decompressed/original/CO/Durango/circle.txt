A white large round object followed by bright Green then bright Blue light moving fast across the sky over Durango Colorado;2019-07-08 22:00:00;15 seconds;A white large round object followed by bright Green then bright Blue light moving fast across the sky over Durango Colorado My sighting was on 7-8-2019 at around 10:00 PM on a clear night over United Campground in Durango Colorado,  My wife saw this with me, moving from East toward West was a round large glowing object.  It had no defined outer perimeter and was  as large as if you held a dime coin about 15 foot from you..  It moved across the sky in about 15 seconds at what appeared to be  maybe 10,000 ft altitude and there was no sound. Shortly after that an airplane was following it but was not as fast. Then to our amazement a very bright green steady light came across the sky on the same path but faster,  That was not the final sighting,  Then a bright Blue light came across the sky on the same course. None of these lights had any blinking marker lights except for the chasing airplane,  We watch the sky most nights looking at satellites etc,  None of this was normal.
