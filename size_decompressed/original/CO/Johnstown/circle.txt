3 white circle objects.;2013-08-23 20:30:00;10 seconds;3 white circle objects. I was in the backseat of the car and i peered to the right when i saw 3 onion ring circle like bright objects (the shape reminded me of a EMP symbol except it was all white).  It was there then it was gone and it did this the 2 other times.;40.3348;-104.9238
29 craft spotted over 5 hr period.;2017-11-13 17:30:00;5 hours;29 craft spotted over 5hr period Have seen 29 craft hovering over Loveland and Johnstown.  They tend to like the area East of i25, south of 34, although have seen others in more areas in Loveland.  (I saw 18 last night, I haven't seen more than ~5 UFOs in my entire life, for context)  They are hovering around 100-200 ft up. 90% of them are a soft orange-white light.  Some are a bright white light. All are entirely noticeably brighter than all other lights in city or sky.  They suspend/hover for around 5 minutes or less, and then proceed with dimming the light and turning blinking lights on (red and white, no green) to mimic a plane.  They proceed in a slow manor and sometimes re-suspend with the bright light.  Videoed one that has no sound about 40 ft up.  I will see as many is 8 suspended near each other, and they will take turns moving to another location, always while blinking, and then to re-suspend, always with a bright constant light. With so many present, I have seen a few up close and either are spherical or have no apparent visible craft.  After turning off the bright light randomly while they are overhead, they turn on the blinking lights and noticeably re-align lights and start moving away slowly.  Some are following me on the frontage road.;40.3348;-104.9238
