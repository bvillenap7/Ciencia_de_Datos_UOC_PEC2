Observed side by side stationary red lights in western sky after dusk.;2017-08-16 21:05:00;3 minutes;Observed side by side stationary red lights in western sky after dusk At approximately 9:05 PM, on August 16, 2017, I observed two stationary red lights, directly west of my home in Johnstown.  They were at about the 10 oâ€™clock position and did not move completely stationary for at least three minutes.   They were very distant and appeared as though they were above the mountain range to the west.  There were aircraft on approach to DIA, but they were far closer and at lower altitudes.  This object (side by side red lights) never moved in any direction.   I went inside to get my wife and when I returned 30-45 seconds later the object was gone.;40.3348;-104.9238

I was out watching the meteor shower Sunday night.  I saw what I thought at first was a dim, yellowish, short-lived meteor straight up (near Vega) tracking north-northwest, and I didn't think much of it.   I then saw a similar flash that looked like another small meteor but on the same trajectory as the first.  I thought both of these were small dim meteors as they were moving across the sky at a speed consistent with a meteor (far faster than any satellite or plane that I've seen). I then saw a third fourth and fifth flash that spanned equally short distances of the sky on this trajectory (it appeared to vere slightly right during the fourth flash).  The object traversed about 30 degrees of sky in about 5 seconds before going out of view.  It made no sound.;40.3348;-104.9238
