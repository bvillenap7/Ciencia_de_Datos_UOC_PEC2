Camping 4.7mi. North of the Great Sand Dunes Nat. Monument on Madano Pass. Noticed light in NW sky appeared to be a large planet, stationary for several min., then moves off to west at a HIGH rate of speed.  Still visible but very faint after moving west, appeared to join a 2nd object and move in formation circling each other, just fade away.  Due to the faintness the 2nd object is not verified.;37.4725;-105.8796
