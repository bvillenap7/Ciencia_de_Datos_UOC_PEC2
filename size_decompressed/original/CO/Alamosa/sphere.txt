They were moving single file to the SE. A ll were equal distant apart except for orb #6, which lagged a bit behind.  The orbs behind #6 were all back to equal distance apart.  There were 15 orbs total, however there could have been more that I had not noticed previously to looking up.;37.4725;-105.8796
