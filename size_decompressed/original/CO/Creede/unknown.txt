Craft over the mountains near Creede, Colorado e;2020-11-08 21:48:00;20 minutes;Craft over the mountains near Creede, Colorado e On Sunday night while elk hunting near Creede my group witnessed a large object hovering to our east over Bristol Head.  The object had multicolor light emanating from it and was extremely large and bright.  It moved west across the ridge from us covering approximately a 10 mile flight in under 10 seconds. As it got closer to our camp we could make out a throbbing hum coming from it.  It moved back east and at one point a red glare light up the valley.  As it approached Creede it made a W type movement and disappeared down out of sight.  7 hunters watched this happen and 2 of our cell phones were doing video but the object wouldn't show on the screen.  Although the audio of us describing it is clear.  One photo did show it clearly.;37.8155;-106.925
