This object looked like a bright star with red, blue, and white lights.  The lights were pertruding mostly downward and were shimmering at different intensities.  The downward lights would also vary in length.  The object was just over the mountain treeline mostly, but would zig-zag up and down, and also occasionally horizontally back and accross.  I also thought it was strange that it's movements weren't necessarily in straight lines either, and varied in speed and length.  It hovered mostly but would suddenly do one of those quick jerky moves.  It would dip down below or right at the tree line quite often.  The object was definatelly moving too fast to be a helecopter or balloon.;37.1664;-104.8266
