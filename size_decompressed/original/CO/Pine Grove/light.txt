At around  10:15 pm, I spotted a flash of light at about 65 degs upward and about 30 degs on the compass.   I estimate 3-4 secs later, it flashed again and I could detect it was slowly moving.  Every 3-5 seconds it would flash again and continued moving toward 65 degs on the compass.  It took about 15 minutes to travel from 30 degs to 65 degs, it became dim and I could no longer detect it. There were no other blinking lights, so, therefore, I conclude it was not a plane.  What it was I cannot say.;39.4665;-105.3732
