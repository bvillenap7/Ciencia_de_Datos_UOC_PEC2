The object had a very wide and pronounced tail, this dive lasted about 10 seconds.  The night was clear except for the leading edge of a front about 80 miles away moving in across the San Luis Valley, the object went behind or into the weather system;37.9472;-105.6813
I used to see you when I lived in Seattle.;2015-11-22 19:00:00;40 seconds;Hi Peter  My name is Jay Weidner.  I used to see you when I lived in Seattle.  Last night my wife and I saw this amazing comet like thing in the sky.  At first it was a bright light like a super bright star above the nearby 14000 foot mountains.   And suddenly it took a right turn heading south.   As it did we both saw a long tail with iridescent colors and then it disappeared.;37.9472;-105.6813
