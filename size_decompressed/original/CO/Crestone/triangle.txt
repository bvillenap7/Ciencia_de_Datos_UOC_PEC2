Triangular lights spotted over Challenger Peak Area from Crestone, Colorado.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2007-09-01 05:30:00;30 minutes;Triangular lights spotted over Challenger Peak Area from Crestone, Colorado. At approximately 05:30 on 1 September 2007 I saw, in the early morning sky, what appeared to be a set of bluish/green triangular lights. The lights appeared over the Challenger Peak area looking eastward from my home. My view was unobstructed and I continued watching the objects with fascination when all of a sudden the triangle moved erratically from side to side and then up and down.  After the erratic movement I woke my wife and asked if she saw what I was seeing (I have lived in this area for seven years and had seen similar sightings on and off but no one believed me)my wife said yes. The triangle then turned into one oval shape giving off a very bright white light. I continued watching this object as it headed in a south easterly direction and disappeared from view. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  Mars may be visible in the morning sky, as well.  PD));37.9472;-105.6813
