UFO shot down over military installation;1996-08-15 22:00:00;15 min. approx;UFO shot down over military installation An extremely large object (approximately the size of a football stadium)was observed to be hovering at an approximate altitude of 1,500-2,000 ft. The shape of the object did not resemble any craft capable of flight. It had more resembalance to a building than an air borne craft. One single yellow-orange light rotated around the perimeter. The craft was approached by two military helicopters, which came within very close proximity to it. The helicopters closed on it briefly, then backed off to a distance of about 200 yds. and maintained their positions. Three seperate missles, apparently ground fired from the Fort Carson military installation were seen to impact the object, causing it to fall to the ground. The line of sight prevented anyone witnessing the actual impact of the craft. The helicopters then left the area following the route they had come from. This activity was observed by approximately 10 individuals in one location to the south and another four at a location some 20 miles to the north, placing the object at almost the center of the field of observation and at a distance to the east.
