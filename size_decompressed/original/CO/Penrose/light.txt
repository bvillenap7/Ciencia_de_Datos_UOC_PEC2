Ball of light setting behind hills;1995-07-15 19:30:00;About 30 seconds;Ball of light setting behind hills A friend and I were driving east out of town one evening, when we saw a big, bright light (like a flood light) in the sky above the hills to the east of town.  It was much bigger than a star, and we caught it directly in front of us as we were driving.  It moved in an arc down towards the hills, much faster than a plane can travel.  It set behind the hills and was not seen again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
