INCREDIBLY FAST.  Its trajectory was that of an arc - like a coma, totally smooth, no wobbling.  No sound, no recognizable shape - just a glow. The glow from tip to tip was of even intensity - no core that was sharper  or brighter.  It was not a meteor, - it traveled even faster than what I have perceived meteors to travel.  I was and still am dumbfounded by the speed., and have even wondered if I imagined it. I am a (almost) 51 year female.  Until October  of last year I was an Asst. Atty General for the State of Colorado.  I don't do any drugs.  I hadn't ingested any alcohol.  I am still confounded by what I saw.  I am a level-headed, individual who weighs the evidence in any situation. I was driving home from my volunteer shift at Children's Hospital, when I made the observation.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
An accelerating streak of light moving upwards through the sky.;2002-12-09 18:45:00;4-5 seconds;An accelerating streak of light moving upwards through the sky. I'm not really a big UFO believer, but I have no idea what this was, and it was strange. I was outside Caffe Luna, a coffee shop in Longmont, running back to the car to get some crayons I had left there because I was going to be using them to make Spanish Flash Cards inside the coffee shop. Something caught my eye. I looked up to the space between two giant trees outside Caffe Luna and I saw something moving steadily and quickly up at a little under a 45 degree angle. I would have thought it was a shooting star, a BIG shooting star, if it weren't for the upward motion. It wasn't a firework because it didn't leave any smoky or sparkly residue behind. Really, it was a streak of very bright, irridescent light that was . . . accelerating I think. Also, the head of it was very definded, like you would think a comet would be. It lasted for about 3 seconds and then it was gone. I shrieked. My huspand followed my gaze, but it was gone, and I like I said, there was no residue left behind.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Clusters of lights flying abnormaly shortly after daybreak.;2003-09-19 07:15:00;10-15 min.;Clusters of lights flying abnormaly shortly after daybreak. It was 7:15 in the morning and the sun had been up for 30-45 minutes. I glanced up and saw the moon which was half a moon. Looking at the moon a bright dot of light caught my eye and I thought I was watching a sattelite. It seemed strange though because it appeared to be veering off a straight line that a sattelite would travel. After watching for a minute I noticed more lights in a grouping and another grouping set apart from it. I thought that they might be spots in my eyes but I noticed that they would disappear behind some high thin strps of clouds. My next thought was that I was viewing commercial aircraft. I stepped under the soffit of my house and used the gutter as a staionary reference point and noticed that the lights moved in random directions and circular patterns. At one point two lights approached a couple of others and ended up reversing directions before they got too close together.I watched one light fly across the visible moon and was able to see it constantly as it passed.After watching for ten or more minutes I saw my neighbor come out of his house and asked him to look. I had to cross the street to do this and was unable to find the clusters I had been watching. We did see one light moving away together. It was very exciting.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Strange lights hovered low in the sky then accelerated quickly from Longmont CO to Boulder.;2004-12-02 22:25:00;12-15 minutes;Strange lights hovered low in the sky then accelerated quickly from Longmont CO to Boulder. I feel stupid reporting this - may be nothing. i observed strange lights that appeared to be hovering in a rural part of Longmont, CO (SW outskirts) for approx. 10 minutes from the time i irst noticed it (approx. 10:25 p.m. MST). the lights were red and white and seemed to twinkle and pulsate, giving it a tumbling appearance, but remained stationary from my perspective, while driving. as my  heading took me nearer the lights, it began to accelerate and head off to the south towards Boulder.  it remained low in the sky (can't estimate) until i lost it in the distance. before i lost sight of it, it did appear to change direction and move to the west. i live near a small airport, so it could have been an airplane, HOWEVER i see those all of the time in the evening and none has ever prompted me to report it!  then again, i could be totally nuts (i'm not).  thanks;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667

Witnesses: 2(could be morepublic) My friend and I were just leaving from another friends house. We came to an intersection which headed west to Boulder, Co. We headed straight. Then all of a sudden out of no where like a shooting star. A bright. I mean BRIGHT blue light shot downward towards the north like it was traveling and we were just seeing it above the clouds. When it went across the sky it was only at first like it was surveying our city. Then as my friend and I realized maybe what this was in the couple seconds it was there. It slowed down almost to a stop then shot at even twice it was going when we first saw it. And that was all we saw. It was a duration of about 6-10 seconds in length. It was no shooting star. It wasn't the space shuttle that was coming back to earth either I will tell you that. I know what I saw. I grew up in Montana. I have been living here in Colorado for about 5-6 years now.

Three stationary red/white lights in eastern sky;2007-03-11 19:45:00;5 Minutes;Three stationary red/white lights in eastern sky Event:  I had stepped outside from one of the trailers onsite to return to the main building.  I was on the east side of the complex, and instantly notice two bright white/red lights due east of my position.  The lights were low in the sky, maybe 5-10 degrees above the “horizon”.  Positioned horizontally level with each other, the lights were separated by about the distance between my hands when my arms were extended straight out from my body.  They lights themselves appeared much larger than any other stars or lights in the sky.  My guess, due to the size of the lights, would be within 1/2 mile of my position.  Neither light appeared to be in motion of any direction, there was absolutely no sound being emitted from either light source.  After observing the lights for about 3 minutes, a third light exactly similar to the other two appeared due south of the original pair, maybe a mile or two away.  From my perspective, it too was stationary.  The thing that caught my attention most was the brightness and the clarity of the lights.  The light was not being “beamed” down or away from the source, nor was it “blinding” in any fashion.  It is best described as “clear and pure” white light, very warm without any pulsation visible.  All three sources emitted the same intensity of white light, which created a “4-point” star effect with two points up/down, and two points each left/right of the source.  What appeared to be emitting from behind each white light source was an equally bright and intense red light, whose points appeared to be along the axis of NW/NE/SW/SE when compared to the white points of light.  I describe the red lights as behind the white lights only from the stand point that the red light spheres appeared to be slightly larger than the white light, and the points of red only shown in between the points of white.  All three lights were much larger than any visible stars.  Also they were larger to any “aircraft” lights as they would normally be viewed.  All three lights remained constantly stationary.  Suddenly the light that appeared after the first two, emitted only a visible red light for about 2 seconds then was “gone” or out of sight.  No noticeable movement or sound was detected.  Then the southern lights of the two original lights appeared to dissipate in the same way: Only the red light visible for a brief moment, then instantly gone.  I viewed the remaining light for another 30 seconds or so, then had to return inside.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Three to four strobe-effect lights pass over Longmont, distinctly different from other aircraft in the area.;2009-11-06 18:20:00;10 minutes;Three to four strobe-effect lights pass over Longmont, distinctly different from other aircraft in the area. Standing outside facing northeast, I spotted three distinct strobe-type white lights in a triangular pattern approximately 30 degrees above the horizon 40 degrees apart from one another.  hey traveled from northeast to northwest.  The lights were different from the lights used on light aircraft (i.e., the position lights consist of an Aviation Red light on the left side, an Aviation Green light on the right and an Aviation White tail light).  There were no position lights and no aircraft noise was audible, just the bright white strobe effect from three different positions in the sky.  The distances changed and shifted, but a triangular pattern of some sort was maintained, and after about 8 minutes one of the lights split into two. I watched for several more minutes until they all vanished into the distance over the foothills.  Other planes were in the area and could be recognized by their normal aircraft position lights.  The sighting lasted approximately 12 minutes;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Lights with spark trails maneuvering over Longmont Colorado.;2012-12-07 19:30:00;1 minute;Lights with spark trails maneuvering over Longmont Colorado. Last night as we left Walmart on the north end of Longmont, we saw three lights, all with trails of sparks, heading SE over Longmont.  I tried to reason what they could be but then they started to fly independently of each other.  Turning and maneuvering around.  They looked like fireworks that was being steered by someone.  Watched for about a minute, then they vanished behind the tree line. Weirdest thing I've ever seen.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667

A light was seen to the South and was very far away and appeared to look like a red ball of light.  At first I assumed it was a plane coming toward my direction.  I then realized it was not moving so I watched it for about a minute.  During this time I tried to debunk it thinking it was just a star, however there was low cloud cover and I realized it couldn't be a star because it was below the cloud ceiling.   I continued to watch, when all of a sudden, it moved horizontally across the sky towards the West and then it just stopped on a dime.  I noticed a plane with blinking lights flying past from West to East and almost immediately the red light zipped towards the plane heading East and again stopped on a dime as if examining the airplane.   This all took about a total of 5 minutes.  I then lost visual of the UFO in the treeline.   The UFO was too far away to film with my sma! rtphone, but I had recalled seeing stuff like this before on the internet thinking it was all fake.  I know what I saw and am now a believer.  Keep watching the sky!;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667

I was sitting at a traffic light on 17th Ave. and Hover St. when I witnessed a pale blue flashing light overhead moving roughly in an east/northeast direction.  It was moving steadily until it appeared to stop and hover right above the FAA Air Traffic Control Center.  It ceased flashing when it stopped moving, and was then just a steady, bright round light.  After a few seconds, it took off moving again and resumed flashing.  It was gone over the eastern horizon in a matter of seconds.

two lights moving in formation in northern Colorado sky. ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-25 20:45:00;2 minutes;two lights moving in formation in northern Colorado sky My wife and I were out walking the dog.  I was looking at the little dipper and noticed two lights moving.  They kept the same distance apart, one behind the other.  It was hard to tell how far apart they were as I assume they were thousands of feet above the ground, but I’ll guess no more than a couple of miles.  I didn’t see any flashing lights so I’m guessing it wasn’t commercial aircraft.  Each was a single steady light.  They were moving eastward or northeastward.  I assume military aircraft or satellite.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Lights very high in the sky moving aircraft speed moving from SW to NE direction. ((Starlink satellites??));2021-05-06 20:43:00;20 minutes;Lights very high in the sky moving aircraft speed moving from SW to NE direction. Evenly spaced in a straight line, appeared to be same height as a star but definitely much higher than aircraft. The lights seem to be diffused. There were about a dozen first pass, then slowly one by one faded out in the sky. About 10 minutes later they appeared again near the same star as first sighting, only there were many more this time. Still seeming to be in formation but with a couple of them spaced closer together. There were 30 or more this time which led me to believe maybe they were flying in a large circle. It was hard to decide if it was a large circle or if there were that many more flying in a straight line. No other aircraft visible in the sky at this time however aircraft sighted several minutes after disappearance of sited crafts. The lights did not vary in brightness but they were not as bright as aircraft or stars. I was looking NW when i first spotted them.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
