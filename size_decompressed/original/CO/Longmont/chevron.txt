V-shaped craft moving silently, one light at the front, two on either wing.;2010-11-05 08:15:00;10-15 seconds;V-shaped craft moving silently, one light at the front, two on either wing. On Friday, November 5, 2010, I was walking my dog in a neighborhood park called Kanemoto in Longmont, Colorado. I let my dog loose to run around. It was just about 8:15 pm. I had noted earlier that it was a particularly clear night, and paused in the park to observe the sky. I was looking at a bright light in the southern sky, trying to determine what planet it was. Suddenly, five points of light in a v-formation appeared to my left, which was to the south-east. I was surprised because I had been observing the area for some time, and there was no incremental appearance of these lights.  Suddenly, they were just there. There was one light leading, with two on either side, making a v.  As it passed over the stars, I could interpolate certain features. Like I said, it was v-shaped, with the wings angled so that the inside length of the v were slightly longer than the outside.  The lights were quite dim, which was unusual.  Planes usual advertise their presence. The running lights, if thatâ€™s what they were, looked dim, but quite distinct.  The entire time I was watching this object, I tried to find some sort of reason for it, but nothing quite fit. As it passed over, there was no noise whatsoever.  I waited for the sounds of a jet-wake, but there was none. There was also a smoothness and certainty to the motion that I had never seen before.  It passed from the southeast to the northwest, going from over my position to the trees and hori! zon in a matter of about 10 seconds. I judged the craft to be a little larger than a fighter jet, cruising at about 1,000-2000 ft.  At that height, the craft had to be moving very swiftly.  If it was larger and higher, it was moving at incredible speeds.  There were no alterations in altitude.  My first thought was that it was a glider with unusual lighting, but its shape, rapidity, and lack of deviation, made me dismiss that theory. Note:  At the trajectory that I saw this object, it should have flown slightly to the southwest of the Air Control center in Longmont.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
6 or 7 Light green circular orbs forming a V-shaped craft or formation travelling half the sky in 20 sec with no sound.;2012-09-08 20:39:00;20 seconds;6 or 7 Light green circular orbs forming a V-shaped craft or formation travelling half the sky in 20 sec with no sound. September 8, 2012 at 8:39pm Longmont CO. 6 or 7 Light green circular orbs forming a V-shaped craft or formation spotted slightly left of Deneb constellation traveling south west towards golden Colorado traversing over half the sky in approximately 20 seconds or less. No sound of any kind and craft seemed translucent with no identifiable outline.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Saw a dark grey chevron shaped object in the night sky moving slowly and silently.;2015-10-16 21:00:00;10 seconds;Saw a dark grey chevron shaped object in the night sky moving slowly and silently.  I could see details on the craft such as small round light shapes that were not illuminated and lines/ridges.   The backside of this boomerang-shaped craft was web-shaped like a duck's foot.  I saw it as it passed over our house from one grove of trees to another.   I had just gotten home from work and I always look up at the night sky before I go inside. It seemed close, but my husband explained that it is difficult judge in a night sky.   I was not frightened, I was in awe.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Silent, large V shaped craft with circular lights on belly of wings faded like glow in the dark football brightness.;2021-03-06 18:00:00;7 seconds;Silent, large V shaped craft with circular lights on belly of wings faded like glow in the dark football brightness. Saturday night March 6, 8pm. East side of main street, Longmont, CO.   Stepped outside to bring laundry to laundry room at my apt.  Looked up at the stars like I always enjoy doing. Was facing south looking at Orion constellation when I noticed movement in lower left part of my view. I turned eyes toward movement and locked onto very large, wide, V shaped craft moving south. Had single row of lights on belly side of wings of craft. There is no fusalage, it's just a V. Estimated altitude possibly 5000 feet. Hard to tell, but pretty high up.  Wing span 3 times as wide as average passenger jet.  Lights were faded almostly ghostly lit. Similar to a glow in the dark frisbee or football faded brightness.  Hard to see unless you are really focusing on it.  Definitely one single solid object, not multiple objects in V formation.  Smooth gliding movement, no sound at all, no blinking marker lights. I have seen this craft 2 other times in Longmont.  Last time I saw this with ! my son when he was 2. We saw this thing very low to the ground, maybe 500 feet stationary hovering above houses. Then it seemed to react to me pointing at it, and it flew towards us and directly over us. That was my 2nd sighting. I noticed then it was transparent, or cloaked, could see the background stars distort around it's edges as it moved. Similar to the Predator in that movie with Arnold. You see the predator better when it is moving in invisibility cloaking because the background distortion around it's edges. Again seeing this much closer up that time, absolutely no sound, no fire, no afterburners. Very smooth movement like melted ice on a counter top. Very large football field size craft. Was bigger than my entire apt. building. I reported that 2nd sighting to Mufon years ago. funny coincidence or not is last time I saw this was Saturday,March 21, 2015 at 8-8:30pm.  Tonight i saw it much higher up Saturday, March 6, 2021, 8pm.  Same month, Sat. night, same time fram! e. Not sure if that relates to anything. I did not have my pho! ne on me , was not expecting to see it. No pictures no video. Even if I had my phone, I was so distracted by looking at the object, by the time my brain tells me pull out phobe to get on camera, it is out of sight. Plus camera phones might not even pick this up that far up in sky at night. Nobody on Earth can ever debunk sightings I have had or convince me it was misidentification of any known craft. People that have never had a sighting really have no say in the matter at all untill you see something yourself. The notion of needing empirical evidence to prove what I say I saw is nonsense, dumb, neanderthal arrogant thinking. I'm not saying this is alien or not, my sense is this is man made secret military craft. Super stealth surveillance platform with some crazy camaflouge or invisibilty cloaking technology.  People want to debunk my thoughts leaning to man made craft and argue that humans don't have that capability, again arrigant closed minded clueless accusation. Reality exists ! in it's true form regardless of peoples opinions. There is disinformation campaign to convince the public to automatically think exotic ufo sightings are always alien to distract from the reality that the military has technology far advanced than they admit.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
