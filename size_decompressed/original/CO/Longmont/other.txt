Train like ufo on Airport Rd in Longmont;1996-06-01 00:00:00;Several seconds;Train like ufo on Airport Rd in Longmont This would have been in 1995 - maybe late 94 or early 96. I was taking my wife home (she was then my girlfriend) down Airport Rd in Longmont. We were heading south and the event happened north of the airport. Back then, Airport Rd was a small, thin two lane road lined with telephone poles. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a long orange glowing object suddenly passing the other direction in the other lane between my car and the telephone poles that were lined up right against the lane going the other direction. The object was floating (traveling, but in the air) about the height of my car window. It was long and continuous, like a floating train passing in the other lane, but with no breaks (no train cars). Couldn't have been a plane because there was no noise, it was long (took several seconds to pass - several), and a plane would have clipped its wings on either my car or the telephone poles lining the other side of the street. As mentioned, it was simi! lar to a train, but probably not as tall - maybe half the height. I never did take a direct look at it - was driving and got nervous - kept my eyes forward. Did not see it coming - it just all of a sudden was passing in the other direction on the side of us. The vehicle behind us (only other vehicle on the back then quiet road) began flashing its lights at us and honking as soon as the object passed (I remember what the vehicle was - but don't want to say in case anyone ever says it was them, so they can tell me what they were driving to prove it was them).  The object itself was nowhere to be seen.  I didn't stop for the other vehicle - I floored it instead - wish I would have stopped to talk with the other vehicle about what we had seen.  My wife usually denies this ever happened in front of other people - only confesses to me sometimes about what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Three black flying figures in the sky heading east during rush hour.;2006-03-29 17:50:00;five minutes;Three black flying figures in the sky heading east during rush hour. My daughter and I were delivering some items to a neighbor when I saw what appeared to be three hangglidders in the air behind my friends home.  It was weird because they appeared to have very tiny parachutes or something stationary above them.  As my daughter and I watched, they flew in a perfect triangle formation and they were black in color.  She started talking about seeing them on a show and that they were flying humonoids.  The strange thing is they kept going higher and higher to the east and flew into a large cloud and disappeared.  They made no sound at all and remained motionless in the air while they were flying.  They were not falling from the sky, more like flying from west to east.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Daylight sighting of two small objects at altitude moving against the wind.;2008-05-24 11:20:00;30 seconds;Daylight sighting of two small objects at altitude moving against the wind. On Saturday morning, May 24th, 2008 I was attending the Silver Creek High School graduation ceremony in Longmont, Colorado.  It was being held outdoors on the football field with the audience facing west, toward the Front Range of the Rockies.  The morning was sunny with a very clear blue sky and a few scattered clouds, surprising since just two days earlier an unusual mile-wide tornado hit in nearby Windsor, CO and Friday had heavy thunderstorms throughout the area. During the speeches portion of the ceremony  I watched a Twin Otter skydiver jump plane climb out of Longmont Airport about a mile and a half north of the graduation location.  Within less than 10 minutes the aircraft climbed to over 12,000 ft. and I observed seven jumpers as tiny dots freefall from the aircraft and open their chutes about 2,000 feet above the airfield.  I watched as they manuvered their very colorful chutes as they descended until they drifted out of sight below buildings in the distance. The recitation of the name of graduates and the handing out of diplomas took quite some time as there were over 200 graduates.  During the hour long process the Twin Otter returned to Longmont Muni and picked up another load and climbed out again for another jump run.  At about 11:20 am as it made its high altitude pass over the airport I watched for the jumpers.  I saw one small dot exit the airplane and looked for more jumpers since they are hard to see initially at such altitude.  As I scanned the sky I spotted two more dots lower than the first one I saw.  I assumed they were also jumpers and I watched them for the deployment of the their chutes. As I watched the two dots, which looked identical to each other with white and dark markings, I realized they were not dropping but moving sideways at 3 to 4 thousand feet above the ground.  My thought was they were gliding in freefall, but as I continued to watch them they were moving further west, away from the airport drop zone.  Maybe they were birds I thought as they moved in relationship to one another, but no wings or flapping were evident.  I pointed them out to my 21 year old son seated next to me and asked what he thought they were.  As we continued to watch, it was clear they were not descending but moving further and further to the west, directly into the very brisk wind that morning.  At one point they maneuvered very close to each other, then apart again.  These two dots continue west toward the mountains and twice near the end, before they were lost to our vision due to distance, they turned and we each saw a glint of sunlight off of them. At this point we don't know what they were.  Obviously not jumpers, unless they had some special flying suit, but they moved several miles west and we never saw any chutes, plus they were in the air too long to be in any kind of free fall.  They could not have been birds due to the speed they were moving which appeared to be greater than 60 mph horizontally, and the metallic glint of sunlight from both of them in the distance does not occur with birds. As a pilot of both fixed wing and helicopters with 40 years of experience, I did not recognize them as any conventional aircraft.  There was no real discernible shape other than just a dot, as a jumper would appear in free fall, yet they moved independent of one another but continuously in the same direction, never more than about 500 feet apart, but sometimes closer. We watched for about 20 or 30 seconds until they disappeared in the distance.  I know these were not birds or waterfowl, due to the speed and lack of any wings.  Additionally ducks or geese will fly in tight formation to conserve energy and these were moving all about. Without any logical explanation of what these two items were, I can only call them a pair of true un-indentified flying objects.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Ferris wheel shaped object sighted over Longmont, Colorado.;2015-08-18 20:30:00;4 minutes;Ferris wheel shaped object sighted over Longmont, Colorado On August 18th, 2015, at approximately 20:30, my daughter and I were returning from the grocery store travelling along 75th street just North of Lookout Road, when my daughter spotted a lighted object travelling about 300 feet over our position.  The object resembled a ferris wheel, circular in shape and approximately 150 feet in diameter, which a slightly domed roof with a thickness of about 20 feet.   Across the back of the object was approximately 60 lights, organized in four rows with about 15 lights in each row.  The lights pulsed on and off in a pattern as the object moved.  The object made no noise, as it traveled due north in parallel with 75th street towards Longmont, Colorado, moving at a speed of approximately 60 mph and accelerating as we tracked the object moving away from our vehicle.   We continued to observe the object traveling over the intersection of 75th Street and Niwot Road, at an elevation of approximately 600 feet.  We then drove East o! n Niwot Road, intent on following the object and lost sight of the object until we arrived at the intersection of 95th Street and Niwot Road.  At this time, we again observed the object at an elevation of approximately 1000 feet, nearly 1 mile North of our location.  We traveled North on 95th Street for several minutes and viewed the object increase its speed and fade from sight.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667

3 bodies connected together, no noise, eggish shape flat on top & bottom, all 3.;2019-05-15 16:00:00;1 minute;3 bodies connected together, no noise, eggish shape flat on top & bottom, all 3. Was at work & went to pull the flag down.  I looked up and saw this object.  It was not making a noise and stayed still.  I snapped a couple pictures and am not a %100 what it was.   I have these pictures if someone could clear them up they maybe able to tell what it is.  I got a weird feeling while looking at it like is this for real!
