Quick, high flying noiseless object;2004-07-19 01:00:00;15 seconds;Quick, high flying noiseless object I stepped out on my porch and was looking to the south.  I saw an object that was very high in the sky and moving very quickly.  All I saw was white light... not very bright, hazy in appearance. It seemed like the size of a airplane, but there was no noise and it's speed was incredible.  Because of the haze and distance away, it's impossible to say what shape the object was.  It moved south to north going the same speed the whole time.  I thought it may be a satellite, but am not so sure, I've seen what I think are satellites and they've alway had the appearance of a star moving across the sky relatively quickly.  This was much bigger and faster.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Two very bright sparkling objects seen while driving one disapeared while the other one moved off slowly out of sight.;2007-12-24 20:15:00;5 mintues;Two very bright sparkling objects seen while driving one disapeared while the other one moved off slowly out of sight. On the Dec 24, 2007, I was sitting in the back of our van traveling east on Hwy 66 out of Longmont, Colorado a few miles before I-25.  Out the front window I noticed from the back seat a very bright light just to the left side of the road about 1 mile ahead of us.  I said to my wife as she was driving, What is that bright light out of your window at your 11:00 O’clock position?   She said that she did not know.  My mother was sitting in the front passenger’s seat.  She said that she did not know either, but that there was another light just like it ahead on the right about 2 miles.   Because I was sitting in the back right hand side I did not notice that one at first because I could not see through my mother’s head.  I repositioned myself and looked out the front to the right and noticed that object as well. My son was sitting next to me in the back seat and saw the two objects also. The objects were very bright and sparkled like the finest diamond with a thousand bursts of colorful flares inside them.  The closer we got to the one on the left hand side of the car, the further down I had to get my head to the floor so that I could see it.   After a few moments I could not see it anymore and so I asked my son if he could see it out of his side window.  He said it was gone.  I asked my wife where the bright light on her side of the van was.  She also said it was gone.  There was quite a bit of traffic on the road moving with us and coming toward us, so she was mostly paying attention to the road, like a good driver.   My mother said that the light on the right side 2 miles ahead was moving away from us.  I stooped down and looked at it as it slowly disappeared to the east. I kept looking into the sky on the rest of our journey home, which took about 25 more minutes after that, hoping to get another look at what I had just seen.  I saw many lights they were all just small planes having the small red flashing light on them, dim compared to the two we had just witnessed.   It was a full moon, partly cloudy, crystal clear stars above, snow on the ground (which reflected a lot of moonlight around to make it seem no so dark that night), and it was about 20 degrees F.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Saw a weird light move quickly and oddly.;2018-01-07 14:00:00;5 minutes;Saw a weird light move quickly and oddly Glanced out the window and saw what looked like a bright light of a plane or star flickering, not moving.  It looked pretty low to the ground for a plane and wasn’t moving. It was maybe 1 mile away.  It then started to move very quick in a straight line and then zig zagged and appeared further away. I ran and got my binoculars and zoomed in and it was a bright white light but couldn’t see anything beyond the light as it flickered. There looked like there was some colored lights in there too but it was further away so I couldn’t see very well because i couldn’t keep the binoculars still enough and it was moving upward. It was then so far away I couldn’t see it with my bare eyes. I then lost sight of it completely. Soon I saw the same light again about 1 mile away from me but maybe 4 miles from it’s starting point in only a few seconds until getting further away and going beyond some trees very quickly. I waited and did see a few flickers of light here and there! but not enough to see its speed or anything and soon it was gone. It was not a plane as it went way too fast, went upward and zig zagged, and I could see no outline of a helicopter or plane and it was low to the ground, lower than a plane would be. And there is nothing out there except an empty field. And it defiantly was not a star. Only one that I know of. Observers were me, 25 and a caregiver and my mom, 48 a caregiver too.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
