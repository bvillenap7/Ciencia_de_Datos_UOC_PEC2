Sphere shaped object moving from East to West, just before Sunset, North of Longmont .;2004-10-18 16:00:00;1;Sphere shaped object moving from East to West, just before Sunset, North of Longmont . Looking North from my hotel room I saw a sphere shaped object going from East to West. It was gaining altitude at a constant rate and maintaining a constant speed. I figured the object to be a small balloon size until it disappered into the clouds and I realized at that distance it had to be as large as a hot air balloon and traveling at a speed faster then any jet. It was silver metalic, and had a definite sphere shape with the sun light at the horizon shining off of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Triangle pattern formed by three separate objects emitting light, adjusted formation and readjusted.;2013-11-07 21:47:00;5-10 seconds;Triangle pattern formed by three separate objects emitting light, adjusted formation and readjusted. Observed three flying objects in triangle patter after arriving home.  Flight pattern was S/SE. with lead craft followed symmetrically by two other craft to form triangle.  Within the span of 5 seconds the two objects overtook the lead object and then returned to initial flight formation.  Object was only identified by emitted light.  Objects were closer than most aircraft, but still far enough away that they each appeared to be round orbs of light.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Possible drone flying in circles very high altitude, Eastern sky 35 degrees declination.;2014-12-10 06:30:00;continuous;Possible drone flying in circles very high altitude, Eastern sky 35 degrees declination. Was out front this am when I saw a very bright light traveling south-west in the high eastern sky. thought it was an airplane at first, then it faded to a mere speck- very hard to see.  Started thinking maybe it was a satellite, as it was heading into the dawns light.  Continued watching it, and it started accelerating pretty fast, then did several circular passes and changed to a nearby location to do the same.   Its speed seems to slow down when it flies in a circle, but speed up when it changes location.  It was hard to tell if it was a drone, it appeared to be very high up in or above the thin clouds.   It was still out there when I came inside to report this.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
