Tear drop shaped light descending over Longmont, Colorado August 21, 2012.;2012-08-21 21:00:00;2 seconds;Tear drop shaped light descending over Longmont, Colorado August 21, 2012. I was looking West and saw a bright blue tear drop shaped &quotthing&quot appear out of nowhere and fall towards the ground in a straight line. I lost sight of it when it fell below tree level.  I first thought it was a fire work or flare but ruled that out as I did not see it ascend from the ground or descend from its apex (fire work), nor did I see any nearby lights of aircraft or the tell tale smoke trail (flare).  As it appeared out of nowhere I realized it wasn't a meteor either.  It seemed to have a liquid quality to it, like a fire work. Its descent from the point where it appeared was rapid but I could not guess a speed.  This one has me stumped and I was hoping someone else saw it and posted their sighting or explanation.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
