Black triangle monolith passed over Longmont, Colorado in the summer of 1978;1978-08-15 12:00:00;15min.;Black triangle monolith passed over Longmont, Colorado, in the summer of 1978. My girlfriend, at the time, and I wrer walking across Mian Street, in Longmont, Co., about mid afternoon.  Beautiful blue sky, no clouds at all!    When suddenely the sky became dark, and I replied to my girlfriend, that it must be going to rain!  Her reply was for me to look up!   and how I'm able to describe of what she and I, and others saw with total amazement, was a dull looking black triangle, about 500ft. high,3-miles wide, and about 5-to 7 miles long.  It had hundreds of lights in straight rows underneath the craft. when the sun did actually shine on it,  it didn't appear to be glossy.  It was high enough to clear the Rocky Mountains, right above the Flatirons,  between Longmont and Boulder, Colorado.  As it passed over us, it did not make a sound at all!   Viewing time was approximately 15min.  I can still remember as if it happened yesterday! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates tht date in August 1978 is approximate.

UFO SITING 06/15/01 ALONG I-25 IN COLORADO;2001-06-15 00:48:00;3-5 min.;UFO SITING 06/15/01 ALONG I-25 IN COLORADO 06/15/01 SITING 	This is written from my notes taken on 05/06/01 hours after my siting.  On 05/06/01 at approximately 00:30 hours I had left my place of employment in the City of Longmont, County of Boulder, State of Colorado.  I was traveling in the left-hand lane of I-25 heading north bound from highway 66.  At approximately 00:48 hours I was north of the Mead exit cresting a hill.  Upon cresting the hill my attention was drawn to an abnormally bright white colored light in the sky north of my location.  At first I thought it was a commercial aircraft far off several thousand feet up in the air.  It should be noted that I-25 runs all the way to Wyoming and this section of highway goes threw both Larirmer and Weld County.  It is very unusual to see commercial aircraft flying in the air space of these Two County's, but I have seen commercial air traffic from time to time flying in these County's. I continued to watch the light and noticed that it never move to the left (west) or the right (east).  I figured that the light was either moving north (away from me) or that it was moving south (towards me).  As I proceeded down the hill I observed the light was now back dropped by the next hill.  I realized that the light was both closer and lower in the sky than I originally thought.  I continued now going up the next hill where this object appeared to be rather close to a bridge.  It should be noted that this bridge crosses over I-25 for east and westbound traffic.  The bridge is located south of mile marker 246 and part way up the hill.  The bridge also has no off or on ramps connecting to I-25. As I approached the Bridge the object appeared to be approximately 200- 300 feet directly above the bridge.  I also observed that there was a red colored light to the right of the white colored light approximately 30 feet apart.  In-between both lights I observed a very dark mass that appeared to connect the two lights.  At this time the object appeared to take on a shape that is similar to that of a cigar.  When I got closer to the object I noticed that the object had some depth to it.  My view changed to where I could see part of what I would assume to be the underside.  The black colored mass appeared to come from the red light heading in a north western direction (away form me) rounding off and headed towards the white colored light. With this new view it took on the shape of a rounded triangle. Just before I proceeded under the bridge I lost my view of the object due to the bridge and the height of my windshield.  I continued under the bridge and traveled approximately two tenths of a mile further and pulled over to the right side of the highway.  I exited out of the driver&#8217s side of my vehicle and looked where I had last seen the object and it was gone.  I did not see any sign of the object around the bridge.  I looked to the east and west along the road connected to the bridge and I did not see any traffic.  The traffic on I-25 both north and southbound was light/ few vehicles and there were other vehicles present at the time.  I looked up to the sky and I saw no signs of the object or any visible signs of any air traffic.  I got back into my vehicle and went home where I then wrote down what I had observed. During this time I did not observe any running lights that one would see on aircraft be it rotary or strobe type.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
blue light orange light then green light flickered on and all lights went out, football field size covers the night sky, low and slow;2006-06-30 22:30:00;15 minutes;blue light orange light then green light flickered on and all lights went out, football field size covers the night sky, low and slow 2006 10:30-11 pm Longmont Co Sunnyvale condos, (warm night with a half moon and light clouds) I cannot remember the date , but I know it was a warmer, only a few clouds in the sky and the moon was almost a half moon  that night in 2006 about 10:30 or 11 pm ( my sister’s boy friend was mad because he was trying to sleep when I went in to call my sister and when we ran through the house to get a look from out front) I went to the balcony to smoke a cigarette , and noticed what appeared to be an air plane in the distance, but it looked different, I went inside and asked my sister to come out and help me decide if it was or not, she noticed the lights were too far apart to be a plane , then I noticed it was too low, and getting bigger as it got closer, we noticed it was huge!!! At least the size a football fields set up long ways I could not figure out the thickness, it seemed like a sheet across the sky, on the left end was a blue light and on the right was an orange light, we watched the object slowly move from the size of a plane in the distance to the large size move! over our apartment and we went out the front door to see it as it moved passed our roof out of sight so we could continue to watch, it was about 15 minutes before we saw a green light flicker on towards the right side then all of the lights quickly went out and the object moved  out of sight as it left we could see the moon and clouds reappear in the sky. (I very distinctly remember the fact that as it passed over us, it was blocking the night sky’s normal features, moon, stars, light clouds etc.  looking closely it appeared to have a reddish brown color) I’ve waited so long to tell this experience because I could not find any other witnesses and was afraid to be criticized but now I’m reaching out because I think this is important and want my experience to be recorded in defense of this type of experience ( p.s.  my sister went to bed after we decided the event was over… about ten minutes later her boyfriend slammed around the house and came in to my room and said” Where ! is she?!” I replied, “my sister?” And he said “duh where did s! he go??? ” I replied, “She went to bed about ten minutes ago”, he went back to the room and she was on the floor next to the bed in a disoriented state, he asked her where she was and she replied, “here in bed”, but she was on the floor and did not know she was on the floor…?)

Big, rectangular, flying object that changed direction.;2016-08-13 02:15:00;2 minutes;Big Rectangular flying object that changed direction n August 13, 2016.  About 2:15 a.m. I was watching the Perseid Meteor shower from my home.  I saw what I thought was an airplane.  It had red, green and blue flashing lights.   We live about 7 miles west of Vance Brand Airport in unincorporated Longmont, so at first I thought it was OK.  Then it grew larger, moving from a direct northeast direction then turned west where it came closer to me and larger in the sky.   I noticed the big boxy shape, like a large rectangle.  This did not look like a normal airplane to me at all!  It was too big and square.  I had a sense of dread as it grew larger and said many prayers, mostly anti-abduction!  Really felt uneasy!  Then, it finally flew back east of my property.  If anyone has any insights as to what this plane was, I'd be glad to hear them!;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
