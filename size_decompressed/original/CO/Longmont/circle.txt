Five circular bluish-white objects moving north to south, 3 first followed by two more in a vertical pattern.;2002-07-06 21:45:00;90 secs;Five circular bluish-white objects moving north to south, 3 first followed by two more in a vertical pattern. On the evening of Saturday July 6, 2002 at about 9:45 pm 3 objects were seen traveling in a nearly vertical pattern (the topmost of the three was lagging a slight amount).  They were moving from north to south at an inclination of about 35 degrees from the horizontal.  There was no sound heard, they stayed in the same relative position to one another as they traveled across the sky.  Their size was hard to determine, if a star were 1/8 inch, these were about an inch and a 1/4.  Their color was a bluish white with a brighter halo about 1/16 inch (using the same relative sizing) of a brighter and bluer color.  They moved southerly and then seemed to go further east and upward until they were lost to sight.  A glance to the north found two more identical objects which followed the same trajectory as the first three.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Three small circles of light in a constantly changing pattern.;2002-07-06 21:45:00;1.5 minutes;Three small circles of light in a constantly changing pattern. Three white circles, about the size of a dime held at arm's length, were observed in the eastern sky about thirty degrees above the horizon. They formed a triangle, but changed their position relative to one another continually and very quickly. About one minute after the initial sighting, the objects grew smaller in diameter and finally disappeared. Two similar (same?) objects reappeared in about the same position and then also blinked out. Observation with binoculars gave no detail other than circles or vertical disks lit from within.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
unknown object sighted and recorded by camera;2005-03-29 04:30:00;4 minutes;unknown object sighted and recorded by camera Object appeared in a flash of white light then disappeared for a few seconds before appearing and proceeding slowly at the speed of a small airplane across the sky from west to east. Object was low in the sky at less than 1000 feet and about one quarter mile away.  Object made no sound and appeared as a fuzzy white light. This same object has been seen four times during the past year.  On two occasions it moved more rapidly and left a white color trail behind it.  On two other occasions the object went behind a cloud and did not re-appear.   However on this occasion the object was photographed by the security camera where the witness works as a security guard.  The recording lasts about two minutes.When the recording is magnified the object is seen to continuously change colors as it moves across the sky from purple to pale green. The recording will remain in the system until April 14 and still pictures can be printed and provided to the reporting center if requested.

Three green spheres flew above us for nearly 45 minutes in Longmont, CO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights??  PD));2005-11-03 21:30:00;45 minutes;Three green spheres flew above us for nearly 45 minutes in Longmont, CO and light flashes appeared in sequence behind 4 clouds. My daughter (who is ((deleted)) at CSU and also works for ((deleted)) in Ft. Collins) and I were visiting a friend in Longmont, CO last Thursday night, 11/3/05.   We noticed three green circular shapes moving high above us.  The dog had been acting very strangely during dinner, to the point that our host had gone outside to see if anyone was there.   During the event the cows were mowing loudly next door, and following the event, the wind chimes seemed to ring very loudly all at once.  It lasted between 30 and 45 minutes.   The objects did not seem to be opaque, but almost like circles of light.  We also noticed extensions from the sides, almost like wings which made a flying or flapping motion.  They flew in patterns, almost parallel at times, and other times in more opposite figure eight-like patterns.   They most interesting thing they did was occasionally collide, after which they would ricochet apart and fly randomly until they got back into some kind of pattern.   We were not afraid, because they appeared almost playful in nature.  There were no sounds that we could hear.  In addition, there was a strange flashing behind four clouds, which were close together.  The flashes would jump in sequence from one cloud to the next, although sometimes it would skip one of the four clouds, and only flash behind the other three.

white orbs or lights following plane then leaving plane to dance and suddenly shoot off to the south.;2006-07-10 12:00:00;3 min.;white orbs or lights following plane then leaving plane to dance and suddenly shoot off to the south. I looked skyward to watch a jet go overhead.  Behind it were these white circles.  I thought they were light reflections off the plane. When the circles were directly overhead they stopped, and the jet went on. At this point the circles moved around rapidly in a small area, then shot off to the south with a lot of speed.

I got up later and they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667

There seemed to be an orange circular object.  He noticed it was zig zagging very fast across an area of the sky and making a loud swooshing sound.  It was zig-zagging right and left and he then noticed it drop very quickly and disappear after about seconds.

White circular object appeared to be static in movement before a strong elevation gain an the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.;2021-06-15 20:00:00;35;White circular object appeared to be static in movement before a strong elevation gain an the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. A circular or round object was seen above the vicinity of South West Longmont on the evening of June 15th, around 20:00, for a duration of 35 to 40 minutes.  The object was illuminated by the sun with the moon visible above and to the left of the object.  After 20 minutes of fairly static position in the sky, the object moved Southeast to Northwest from our vantage point, the began to ascend to greater heights.  A video was uploaded to YouTube around 20:45, I have not seen the video at this time.  Through binoculars (10 x 24), the object appeared perfectly circular from our perspective.  NCAR and UCAR are 10 to 12 miles south southwest of Longmont.  The local airport data would be KLMO.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
