Hovering saucer;1982-05-09 20:00:00;1-3 min;Hovering saucer This event took place quite a while ago I was only 4 or 5 years old I haven't tried to make any report of it. Knowing by now my memory of the event will not be totally accurate I have not wished to report it. However, the memory of something very out of the ordinary remains and particular parts of the memory remain clearly as if it only happened yesterday. I remember even to this day what I was doing just before the event and I remember my dog had been with me at the time that I was sitting outside my house in my yard. I don't remember seeing the object come closer to me, so that I can't verify that for its been too long. However, I remember seeing the object either a little higher or a little lower than the telephone line than runs through my backyard and wasn't more than 150 yards in distance from where I had been sitting when I remember seeing it. This object was a classic saucer shape. It still seems like it just suddenly appeared and I remember being unsure of what it was I was seeing. My parents didn't allow me to see scary movies, in fact I had no idea what a UFO was until I picked up a book in the school library at 6 or 7 years old, recognizing the picture on the front -- suddenly realizing I had seen that same thing. I remember the object hovering over the yard in the far corner, and the noise I heard is what I remember the most...a drowning repetitive sound that never changed in pitch. The moment I felt fear struck me when this object unknown to me at the time to what it could possibly be, overtook me when the lights from the object fell to the ground, like a spotlight. I can't say for sure what colors they were except that I believe it was possibly 3 colors, either red, white, and green, or red white, and blue. I'm not even sure anymore how those colors actually formed on the ground other than it formed a circle below the object. My instinct even at that young of age took over, and I ran (luckily my door wasn't very far from where I had been sitting) straight into the house with my dog ! right be hind me. My Mom recounts the incident, still remembering me coming inside screaming and saying there was something in the sky. She says my dog was very upset and spooked, and acted like she was nervous. When my Mom went to look outside to see what I could have been possibly talking about, it had disappeared without a trace. My Mom also says she remembers me mentioning the noise and she questioned me, asking if it was a helicopter. I told her no, and described the noise to her. She remembers me walking out in the yard to show her where I had seen it -- in approximately the corner of my yard. For many years now I have tried to tell myself that if I saw anything it had to be something the military made. However I have never gotten over that feeling of complete fear when those lights hit the ground...as if whatever was in that object, knew I was there. I am a student of psychology, I know that the mind recreates memories, however there are three things I know I couldn't have make up -- the fear I felt -- that sound I heard and the fact it hovered without any wobbling. Recently, I have begun to accept my memory of the event and have done some research and that is why now I can share it with someone who might find the report useful in some way. I'm not afraid that someone might think I was crazy, because I pondered the thought myself for many years and truthfully at one time I preferred that thought over the thought of it really being something unknown.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
I saw lights in he sky.  It had five lighs in a row, each flashing one a time in a row. It was also urning slowly.;1999-03-24 21:00:00;3 minues;I saw lights in he sky.  It had five lighs in a row, each flashing one a time in a row. It was also urning slowly. I was sitting alone in my window seal admirering the stars. I saw a flash of light out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look closer. It was definetly not an airplane. It was the shape of a saucer and had lighs going around it.  I had to rub my eyse because I could not beleive what I saw.  I watched it for a couple minutes, then I ran down the stairs yelling for my brother. I knew he would love to see it. I was screaming that there was a UFO outside and we both ran together outside to see it.  It had disapeared. I was the only one to see it.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
White disc in Colorado sighted making sudden abrupt changes in direction and speed...;2004-10-29 08:30:00;10 seconds;White disc in Colorado sighted making sudden abrupt changes in direction and speed... I saw a white disc appear out of some thin cirrus clouds that was traveling at a high rate of speed(approx. 700 mph)and was probably 35000 ft high...It then made several(at least3) abrupt changes in direction and speed and then disappeared without a trace into clouds once again. I have never seen an object make so many harsh turns in my life and would think any person traveling inside would be crushed to pieces unless gravity was altered. It was the most amazing thing i have ever seen. There was no contrail from the object and no audible sounds that I could detect. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Fleet of disc shaped objects discovered in photograph taken in Longmont CO.;2014-01-29 18:17:00;seconds;Fleet of disc shaped objects discovered in photograph taken in Longmont CO. January 29, 2014. I was driving south on 95th Street from Longmont.  The sky was a beautiful blue and I pulled over to take some photographs.  When I downloaded them from my camera (Canon EOS Rebel T3), I noticed a series of 20+ objects in the 1st photo.  In the second photo (taken 12 seconds later) theyâ€™re gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photo, and we are unable to identify the objects.  They do not look to us to be discs, and they don't appear to have the precise nature one would expect if the objects were alien craft.  However, they do not look to us to be consistent with birds in flight, either.  PD));40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
