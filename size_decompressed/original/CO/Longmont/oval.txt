I was just watching a documentary on Netflix about Denver International Airport called America Declassified.   Toward the end of the episode they played footage of a UFO sighting outside of Denver.

a large orange orb that divided into 6 and lasted low on the horizon for 1-2 minutes;2009-07-02 22:08:00;2min;a large orange orb that divided into 6 and lasted low on the horizon for 1-2 minutes I saw a large. yellow-orange circle-too large for a star in the south west. I watched for a while then went outside. I called my husband who felt it was too slow for fire works. It slowly turned into 2 then 4 then five then six large flattened ovals but did not move. Then after a minute it started moving slowly south then decended slightly and disappeared instantly. There were fireworks in the area but none at the time of the sighting. aerials are not allowed in or area.There was no sound accompanying the orbs. We are medical professionals and have good vision and have never seen a strange object we cold not identify. From our prospective this was 50 times larger than a local airplane.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Light disappeared.;2014-06-14 00:30:00;45 seconds;Light disappeared. I was standing outside smoking about 0:45 am, when I noticed a bright star like object about 45 degrees above the horizon. I was watching it change colors from red to blue to white like a star. I then saw it go dim like a light bulb, then it just disappeared.   There were NO clouds in the sky last night. I reached for my phone to use my Droid Sky View to see what star or planet it was.  There was NO planet in that area this morning.

12 red/orange large, identical, oval objects, flying exact same speed, slowly over Longmont, CO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lanterns?  PD));2017-02-17 18:45:00;5 minutes;12 red/orange large, identical, oval objects, flying exact same speed, slowly over Longmont, CO. I saw a dozen oval/elongated rectangular large (car sized?) objects flying slowly across sky heading NE.  All objects were identical.  They made absolutely no sound.  Each had red/orange lights on each side and maybe one in the middle – the lights kind of blended together – hard to tell.  They all traveled at the same speed and though not in a straight line held the exact line pattern the entire time they traveled through the sky.  They appeared to be flying about the same height as small airplanes do in our area – 1,500 feet?  They did not waver in speed or direction.  Lights did not flicker – only saw steady red/orange lights on each. See youtube video “six orange UFO fireball phenomenon 2013” – this is almost identical to what I saw except objects were more oval/elongated rectangular than round.   Color and lights were exactly the same as seen in this video. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Turns out what I saw was Chinese lanterns after all.   Some people sent up about 15 of them at sunset that day, in honor of someone who died 5 yrs ago.  If you google Times Call Longmont Aliens, you'll see the story. I guess my eyes aren't as good as I thought they were!  So sorry to take up so much of your time. ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
12 orange red objects flying across Longmont in NE direction;2017-02-25 18:45:00;5 minutes;12 orange red objects flying across Longmont in NE direction. I saw 12 orange/red objects flying in NE direction.  First saw one then another a ways behind it it but off to the side.  Each flying the exact same speed.  Then another and another and another, etc.  Counted 12 total.  All flying the exact same speed.  Totally silent.   Appeared to have 2 or 3 orange red lights that made up most of the object.  Shape was either long oval or saucer but all were the same.  Smaller than any plane but much larger than a drone.

((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2)) Hi Peter,  Sorry for the slow response time  I work at ((deleted)) - 12 hour shifts - Fri, sat, sun so have been busy. Am I satisfied?   I looked again at the drawing I made soon after seeing the objects and while they didn't appear to be Chinese lanterns, it is possible that at the right height and right angle maybe they could be.  The thing that throws me off is that I remember when I saw them I thought they were way too big to be drones - even really, really large drones.   The next morning I googled drones and thought that maybe the drones that are large enough to carry one person might be large enough to match what I saw hence car sized or small car sized.   I never did see any of them rise rapidly in the sky and disappear.   They all maintained the exact height and distribution pattern the entire time I watched them move off to the NE until they were just small orange/red objects.  It was not windy that night.    I'm torn. However, without a picture or video of what I saw I have to let it go.   I can't prove anything. I sure will keep an eye to the sky though and keep my cell phone with me at all times!   Thank you! ((END ADDENDUM #2));40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
