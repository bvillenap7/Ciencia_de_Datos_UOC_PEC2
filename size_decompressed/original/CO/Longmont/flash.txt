I was on Pike Rd. looking West, and I saw a shot of sparks going from South to North....way too high for fireworks or even planes. I live in South-West Longmont and wonder if anyone saw this? I also had a sighting just like this in in 1985...in Ventura California. In both cases it looked as if a plane (or other craft) was going down in flames. Lots of guys in grey coats visited me until 3am that night, and never gave their I.D. I am not even kidding. I called the next day, and the person who answered said they never found the plane.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
