Traingle craft about 60+ feet in diameter was sighted flying west of Longmont CO.;1998-07-18 10:07:00;3 to 5 minutes;Traingle craft about 60+ feet in diameter was sighted flying west of Longmont CO. Large dark triangle craft spotted. On 7-18-98 at  about 10:02 PM Mountain Time (04:02 Universal Time) as my family and I drove west away from the Wal-Mart store in Longmont Colorado we spotted a craft flying from the southwest of our area and moving northward across our field of view.  It was moving slowing and in a slightly jerky manner and this caught my attention.  It seemed to have a great many red pulsating lights with some white lights in the central area.  At the time I wondered if it were a helicopter.  It descended toward the Longmont Airport, but it did not follow the usual flight path and was actually going down toward the farm fields just south of the airport.   We lost sight of it behind trees as we drove and I forgot about it.  About 5 minutes later (about 10:07 PM) we were driving north toward the west end of the airport when we spotted a craft that looked like the first one.  We assumed it was the same one.  The craft looked like a very large plane ascending from the west end of the airport.  It was moving slowly and was large enough that as it crossed the road ahead of us the lights on the front passed over the farm fence west of the road as the rear lights were still well toward the east of the road.  The length appeared to be 50 to 60 feet.  As we drove up toward this seen we assumed that this was merely a very large plane.  The airport normally handles small twin engine and single engine aircraft.  Thus, we eyed the craft as it slowly flew over the road about 50 feet above the ground. I commented that it was lit funny because it seemed to be box shaped in that the rear had at least two red lights one above the other, and the front of the craft had two or more red lights in a vertical column.  In the middle area were other red lights and some white.  All four of the four people in the car continued to stare at the craft  on the West side of the Airport as the car was greatly slowed.  The craft ascended slowly toward the west to about 120 feet above the ground and about 1300 feet west of the road.  Then it appeared to stop! and hover.  At no time did the lights change direction and the craft at no time banked or turned around.  Because the lights did not change their orientation we continued to assume that the craft was still going west even though the craft was now growing larger.  Suddenly we realized it was headed back towards us, it having never executed a turn, and it was ascending as it moved back toward the airport in a slight northeast direction.  It came very near the rear of our car (from 160 to 200 feet).  No airplane motor noise was heard - at other times we have heard the engines of smaller craft passing over the road.  It passed over the road at about 170 feet above the ground.  As it neared the road three people in the car saw that the craft was shaped like a triangle with three equal sides.  The leading point was facing the northeast in the direction of its movement.  Many new lights were seen on its bottom hull.  Along each of the two side angles there ran long tube like lights, like neon tubes, that were a yellowish-white.  These tubes curved inward near the west end of the craft and came to sharp points. Just east of each was a large round red light and toward the west two more red lights.  Near the apex of the triangle, the east tip, was a large round recessed hole in which was a bright light-blue light.  While the red lights had been pulsating earlier as the craft was moving west, now all the lights were continually on with no blinking or pulsation.  The lights provided enough illumination to allow the viewers to see that the craft had a dark triangle hull.  We quickly tried to pull over onto another side road to we could get out.  We saw the craft move silently toward the middle section of the airport area, just north of the runway at about 350 feet above the ground.  Then the craft changed course and moved northward until it was hidden by trees near us.  We drove to another location where we could see the surrounding area but the craft was no where in sight.  AT this point it was about 10:12 PM Mountai! n Time. It appears that as the craft lifted off from the airport grounds toward the west it was moving with the flat side of the triangle toward the direction of its movement.  It then stopped and hovered a moment as it lifted the east tip of the triangle and reversed course in a slight climb back over the airport grounds.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Many small lights, boomerang formation, going due south. Saw same 3 weeks ago.;1999-12-12 21:30:00;1 minute;Many small lights, boomerang formation, going due south. Saw same 3 weeks ago. Went out for cigarette. Always looking at stars. Saw boomerang shaped formation of many small lights, visible for 1 to 1 1/2 mins. Going due south. We were facing west when we saw this. Same thing happened 3 weeks ago. It just moved across the sky and shape didn't change. No noise. Lights, white, smaller than most stars. Huge formation. I have a doctorate, my son, who is a hiker, camper, fisherman, works in a plant in Longmont. We are spiritual people. Don't know if it was an object or many objects, so unable to correctly answer questions below. I don't know who I am talking to, therefore I do not want an investigator visiting me. You may email me. I'm not happy with what I saw. When living in NH I saw everything but this type of thing in the sky. Scary. Thank you.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Cloaked Triangle shaped outlined with stars.;2001-06-06 23:00:00;5-10 min;Cloaked Triangle shaped outlined with stars. I am posting this information in response to previously posted report.  Date is approximate.  Out on the balcony having a conversation with a friend when my eyes caught first one star moving, then noticed a formation of 4 or 6 stars moving in a triangle shape.  This information was only registering in the back of my brain until this group of stars and night went in front of a large cloud.  Only then did i interrupt my friend to point this triangle shape of stars. Cloaking Device weirdness.   Unlike the previous report of this, there was no sound which led us to believe it was far in the sky and huge.  I mean huge.  It looked like the shape of a stealth bomber, and if it was then it would have had to have been close.  Reach out and touch it close.  But absolutely no sound.  Spoke of this at work the next day with a vendor in Arizona after he brought up similiar sightings there that night.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
3 bluish lights in a triangel shape streaked across the sky at a very high rate of speed.;2004-08-14 23:45:00;3 seconds;3 bluish lights in a triangel shape streaked across the sky at a very high rate of speed. Saturday night my wife and I were out on the balcony looking at the stars, planet actually when out of nowhere 3 bluish lights in a triangle shape pattern appeared and streaked across the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared.  The object made absolutely no sound. The object was also very large and would have made a jetliner look like it was standing still.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
((HOAX??))  LONGMONT, COLORADO-MASSIVE TRIANGLE FOR ATY LEAST 1 HOUR;2008-02-19 18:40:00;1 hour+;LONGMONT, COLORADO-MASSIVE TRIANGLE FOR ATY LEAST 1 HOUR Over the course of at least 1+hour, three massive bright gold/red colored lights in sky formed a triangle, then a perfect diagonal line, then a perfect horizontal line, spread apart, rotated in a VERY large circle. One light (not sure if related)--circular shape bright light went straight up in the air leaving a huge trail in the sky. it looked like a massive light beam from the bottom. The craft rose straight up and disappeared. The 3 lights sat close to the horizon for about 1+ hour after this event. Lots of airplane activity around this. If the lights were connected--it was MASSIVE!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  Possible hoax, we wonder.

UFO might have been invisible to the naked eye but my digital camera got it!!!;2008-09-29 10:41:00;45 seconds;UFO might have been invisible to the naked eye but my digital camera got it!!! I was not aware of the UFO's appearance at the time this picture was taken but noticed it on 10-21-08 while I was reviewing my pictures for editing and filing. These are copies of the original which I still have. I also have the whole file of pictures that I took on that day to show that there were no clouds in the sky or any foreign material on the camera lens. The edited ones are enlargements out of the original. The picture was taken outside on a sunny, cloudless, clear, warm day at 10:41am MDT on 09/29/2008 with my NIKON COOLPIX 8700 digital camera.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667

2 triangular flashing lights, one doesn't move at all and the other does;2015-10-09 00:00:00;10 minutes;2 triangular flashing lights, one doesn't move at all and the other does 3 triangle lights flashing at different rates.  One triangle is not moving but flashing , the other triangle is moving away from the other.  Appears far away, seen better with binoculars.  Lights are red white and green and would flash quickly then slowly and blink.  Soon the one not moving went in the direction of the other and faded into the darkness and couldn't be seen anymore.
