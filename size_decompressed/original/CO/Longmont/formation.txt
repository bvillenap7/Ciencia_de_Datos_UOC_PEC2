The objects or object was flying from the north and traveling south, no sound noticed with travel of object and was traveling very fast then everything vanished. I have seen stuff fall into the earth but nothing like this. whatever this was got me excited, this is one is for the x files.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Two sets of faint orange lights appering to each be silently flying in v formations;2012-10-08 00:30:00;5-10 seconds;Two sets of faint orange lights appering to each be silently flying in v formations From an apartment balcony a friend and I saw two sets of faint orange lights flying in v shapes.  One set was about ten lengths ahead of the other.  Neither of us saw them appear but both sets faded away as if they became too distant to see.  They were silent.  I am an a&p mechanic and aircraft enthusiast and was unable to identify this sighting.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
UFO with visible cloaking device in Northern Longmont, Colorado.;2014-09-21 10:34:00;1-2 minutes;UFO with visible cloaking device in Northern Longmont, Colorado. On our way back from a camping trip in outside of Estes Park.  We drove home through Loveland south on I-25 towards Broomfield..   After we were going down I-25 for about 15 minute south of Littleton.  To the west I seen a blob in the sky.  It was transforming but sort of a circular shape, it almost flowed like an amoeba,  it was probably 3 or 4 miles from i25 and at least 5000 feet up in the sky, the off thing is that it seemed to have a cloaking device.   We could all see the UFO once I spotted it, but it wasn't a defined color, it was not opaque but translucent, you could see the sky behind it but you knew it was there because it was an off color to the sky, a darker gray almost.  But there was definetly a cloaking device, it didn't seem to advanced of a cloaking device for we were able to see the ship, so I wonder if this wasn't a secret military craft rather than an alien, the UFO seemed to just hover in the same area but it was still slightly moving.  The cloaking device was seemingly flowing but the movement of the object was glitchy, almost laggy, but it didn't seem to move from the location it was over.   We eventually got excited talking about it and we quit looking but we'd look back and see it for about a minute or two, then we couldn't see it anymore.   I was with 3 other people + myself so 4 people total.   I am 21, the other 3 observers were 20, there was 3 males and 1 female in our group.   Excuse my grammar and structure of this report, I was excited and had to type this ASAP.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
11/14/2016 - 4-6 large white circles in two groups moving, disappearing and re-appearing  and circling each other in the Eastern sky.;2016-11-14 21:00:00;30 minutes;11/14/2016 - 4-6 large white circles in two groups moving, disappearing and re-appearing  and circling each other in the Eastern sky. Driving east on Nelson Road at 8:45 PM and saw 2 groups of round, white circles to the East.  Some were the same size and some were smaller in sized in each group.  There were 3 circles in the group to the north at first, then 1 circle would drop down, then re-appear again quickly.  There were 4 circles at first in the southernmost group.  The number also varied from 2 large circles and 2 small circles that would move, reappear, then disappear. The two large circles seemed to rotate around each other.  The circles disappeared from the sky, one by one, until only the last large circle was left.  It was difficult to track the movement of the circles.  Sometimes I could see them move, other times they just seemed to appear, then disappear.  The was no sound.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Line of individual lights in Boulder County;2020-12-04 18:20:00;2 min;Line of individual lights in Boulder County A line of lights was traveling across the sky from west travelling north east. They disappeared one by one (not behind a cloud because they never reappeared). There were around 20 of the individual lights. They appeared to be traveling in a straight line.  Itâ€™s pretty clear here tonight and we can see stars.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
