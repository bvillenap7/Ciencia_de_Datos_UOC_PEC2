(Clicking ...examples gives Not Found);2000-09-07 23:42:00;1 sec.;Fireball sighted in a northerly direction from near Longmont, Colorado. (Clicking ...examples gives Not Found) I was northbound on I-25 and was approximately at milepost 234 ( north of Exit 232 to Erie). The fireball was green and was probably a meteorite. It was at a heading of approximately 350 degrees. It descended vertically to less than 5 degrees above the horizon. The topography is relatively flat at  that location and continuing north into Wyoming. I noted some landmarks, so the accuracy of these data could be improved if necessary, especiially if triangulation is used. I cannot estimate my distance from the object. (Note: I was unable to send this report from Netscape 4.5) ((NUFORC Note:  Another report received about this event.  PD));40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Green fireball in northern sky, moving rapidly to the left toward earth, and disappeared.;2001-06-07 22:00:00;seconds;Green fireball in northern sky, moving rapidly to the left toward earth, and disappeared. I witnessed the same green fireball in the northern sky as was reported earlier by people on this site.  Amazing green color, and not a shooting star.  I reported it to my husband upon returning home - Have seen many shooting stars, never a green fireball in 64 years of life on earth.  I am a believer in UFO's and also Big Foot, which I have a fabulous story to tell about.  Also, a friend has seen an UPO on the ground in Wyoming.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
3 UFOs seen over Longmont Colorado 12/7/12.;2012-12-07 19:28:00;2.5 minutes;3 UFOs seen over Longmont Colorado 12/7/12 I was driving home from work, east down highway 119 in Boulder County between Boulder and Longmont. I first saw the ufos at the intersection of 119 and highway 52 (next to IBM). Directly ahead (East) I saw what I though was three planes making an approach to land at DIA. This is a common site in the east at night.  I though that they looked a little strange and large. As soon as as I thought this the longer one started to &quotfall&quot leaving a small trail.   Right away i thought maybe a shooting star, but why had they have been almost stationary then start to fall? I called my wife right away. Very soon (a couple of seconds later) the other two started moving right (South) and then they all kind of danced around each other slowly moving down, although the did make movements up. I was on the phone with my wife the whole time and it was a 3 minute phone call, so I figure about 2.5 minute duration.  They all did gradually move downward disappearing behind the ! treeline.  At one point they all dissappeared for a few seconds only to reapear.  I estimate they were between 1-2.5miles away.  Between the size of a star and and asprin at roughly 30 degrees from the horizon.  They all left small glittering trails but not flame like. When the last one moved behind the tree I did not see them again.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Three dancing, erratically moving sparkling fireballs observed from a short distance.;2012-12-07 20:00:00;5 minutes;Three dancing, erratically moving sparkling fireballs observed from a short distance We were driving into the parking lot on the north side of the intersection of Martin and Ken Pratt, we were just behind the DSW Shoes building on our way to a restaurant when I asked my husband to stop the car.  I had seen a strange light flashing in the field just behind this parking lot.  He did and we watched as 3 golden balls of light with sparkling tails danced slowly around each other, no more than 300-500 yards from where we watched, and not very high in the sky, maybe 300 yards. Their trajectory was descending, but not linear.  Sometimes they would pause for awhile or move horizontal to the ground.  At least one of them sped up about 100 yards off the ground and extinguished just before hitting the field. All of them eventually extinguished about 20-50 yards above the field. I don't believe in this type of thing.  I am a PhD candidate in the social sciences and believe firmly in ruling out the most plausible explanations before jumping to something unlikely.  But this is empirical evidence for something that I do not have an explanation for.  I can't get the scene out of my mind and it has kept me up all night.  We do not live far from the field and in the morning we will go investigate.  I feel an irrational coward for not investigating last night, but somehow it felt overwhelmingly wrong to do so.  Oh, and after spending all night looking at the Internet, I can tell you it is not Chinese lanterns.  I've seen a video of those and this looked nothing like that.  There was no wind to account for the movements, they were sparkling, and they were speeding up, slowing down, and hovering.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
3 Red, Orange & Yellow Fireballs appear in sky to family of 3.;2012-12-10 19:15:00;3 to 4 minutes;3 Red, Orange & Yellow Fireballs appear in sky to family of 3 We were driving to a store in the southeast end of Longmont, Colorado.  I was with my daughter and her son who is one year and four months old. We parked about 100 feet from the store. It was quite cold and we headed for the store entrance.  I happened to look in the sky in the northeast direction. At first I saw one light, and thought it could be an airplane.  But then two more lights appeared and the three lights seemed to be traveling together ala three synchronized swimmers. The three lights moved up and down and for a few moments appearing to be on the same roller coaster in the sky.  The lights slowly changed colors, mostly reds, oranges and yellows.  At times one or two of the lights would suddenly disappear and seconds later re-appear. The three lights resembled meteors (as in “shooting stars”) – but much bigger, and moving in unusual ways.  Shooting stars streak across the sky and suddenly blip and they disappear.  These three fireballs in the sky were clearly visible and lasted for at least 3 to 4 minutes. My daughter saw the lights too.  The lights did not appear to her to be what she would consider as a UFO, but I asked her what she thought we saw, and she could not explain what we had just witnessed.  My grandson stared at the fireballs but had no comment.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
3 Fireballs with a spark-like tail moving in a serpentine pattern with light fading on and off.;2013-12-13 19:31:00;1 minute;3 Fireballs with a spark-like tail moving in a serpentine pattern with light fading on and off. My 2 friends and I saw single fireball in the sky heading downwards towards the north viewing from the west.  After about 10 seconds the first one disappeared and the second object appeared and started taking a similar path.  The first object re-illuminated and started falling towards the South in a stop-and-go pattern.  The second object taking a similar path but not exact.  After 2 of the first objects went behind a tree, the third object appeared and started Falling South.  The Second object reemerged and went north on a flat plane and then the third object kept falling South in a stop-and-go pattern and the light went out and went back on 1 time during its fall. NOTE: I saw something about one year that contained 3 objects following the same pattern in the same exact part of the sky. Also, we saw a civilian plane circling the object (not knowing how close or far away they were) and then sped off towards Boulder Airport.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667

In the east/south sky I noticed objects that appeared as fireballs seeming to interact with each other in a circular pattern. At first I honestly thought a plane had exploded in mid air I was witnessing its firey pieces falling to earth.... however they didn't fall they stayed in the air, as if being controlled. To the naked eye they appeared as fireballs with fire tails but strangely when video taped they where recorded as pulsing orbs and the fire part was not visible.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667

I saw a large orange object slowly moving over my apartment building.;2016-07-04 23:30:00;1 minute;I saw a large orange object slowly moving over my apartment building. From my 3rd floor balcony facing West I saw a large orange object slowly moving in a straight line in a NE direction over my apartment building. I assumed that it was a stray firework at first, but it was way too big and moving too slowly to be a firework, plane or satellite. My background: I am a 50ish male, college educated, no military service.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
