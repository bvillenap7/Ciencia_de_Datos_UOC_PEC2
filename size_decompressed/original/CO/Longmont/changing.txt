7 bright, white round UFOs seen over Longmont, CO on 6/27/13;2013-06-27 11:00:00;10 minutes;7 bright, white round UFOs seen over Longmont, CO on 6/27/13 We were driving north, when my daughter (15) spotted 7 whitish objects high in the western sky (in broad daylight).  She asked what they were, and I assumed they were gulls.  We stopped the car to watch them more carefully, because we noticed no wings were flapping.  They looked at first flat, which is why I assumed they were birds, but they were too high in the sky, and there was no wing-flapping at all.  They were moving, changing different formations, from four in a square, with three opposite, and sometimes triangles, and lines.  At this point, they appeared more round, and I thought maybe they were balloons. However, at one point, one broke away from the other six, and flew northeast.  Then a few moments later, a second one did the same thing.  A third one seemed to begin to do this, but it stopped and stayed closer to the other four.  The remaining four continued to make different formations, mostly staying in a square pattern, and slowly moved in a NE direction.   Then, the three that had broken away, began to come back, in a straight line, parallel to the four in a square formation, and they all moved NE.  Then they vanished.  This all happened in about a ten minute period. When they were all together, we observed them flying past each other, back and forth, very closely--could not have been planes, nor balloons, nor birds.   No idea what these could have been.  They were very bright, white, and my daughter says she thought she saw black around the edges of them.;40.1496966666669;-105.053814666667
Three flying objects in perfect triangular formations appearing and disappearing.;2013-07-24 09:23:00;20 minutes;Three flying objects in perfect triangular formations appearing and disappearing At first three appeared in perfect triangular formation and continually got brighter like they were fast approaching.  Then they split in different directions and appeared within seconds what would be miles away from where they were last seen.  The middle one continued to get brighter, and then a fourth one appeared.  And three of the 4 disappeared while the 4th stayed bright in the sky.  This was very unusual.  Definitely not an airplane.
