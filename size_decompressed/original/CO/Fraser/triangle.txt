5, red, triangular shaped, crafts fly across the night sky in Colorado............;2001-11-16 22:10:00;5 seconds;5, red, triangular shaped, crafts fly across the night sky in Colorado............ There were 4 of us laying out in the back yard to watch the Leonid Meteor shower (it was the day before the peak, but there were a few.)  Person #1 is male, 16, and in the 10th grade in high school.  Person #2 is female, 16, and in 11th grade in high school. Person #3 is male, 16 and in 11th grade in high school. Person #4 is female, 14, and homeschooled. Person #1 and #4 are brother and sister. The sky was crystal clear.  Person #1 fell asleep. At approx 10:10 pm persons 2, 3, and 4 all saw 5, red, jagged triangular shaped crafts, flying in a perfect V shape across the sky.  They stayed in perfect formation, and flew really fast from east to west.  They didn't make a sound, and seemed to be flying at  about 150 ft above.  We were all frozen, staring at them with disbelief until after they passed.  Then, petrified, we all ran inside as fast as we could and told person # 1 and 4 mother about what we saw.  We then looked up UFO sightings in Colorado, online and found this site.;39.947;-105.8122
