Cross-shaped lighted UFO south of Cimarron, CO.;2017-06-09 21:45:00;5-10 minutes;Cross- shaped lighted UFO south of Cimarron, CO. The object caught my eye on the western skyline, as it slowly gained altitude and began to move towards me.  The object moved silently and slowly from the west towards the full moon in a flight path directly over my campsite.  I estimated the object altitude to be approximately 2000-4000 feet above my head as it passed above me.   A commercial jet entered my field of vision to the northeast of the object, flying west.  The jets were easily heard and the flasing lights were clearly visible on the commercial airplane, even at the much higher altitude.  In contrast the UFO made no noise and the lights were constant. As the object passed above me I saw two large rectangular light panels, one to the front and one behind with a smaller square panel on each side at the center point.   The lights were very bright as it went overhead and the moonlight was also bright, but i could not see any shape or outline, only the cross shaped light panels.  The object moved towards the fu! ll moon and seemed to gain speed as it became smaller and disappeared, last seen moving towards the moon in a shallow ascent.   A few things about this sighting that i really can not explain or understand are: - the object did not move in a conventional manner when the object transitioned from a vertical ascent to an eastern flight path, the path was noticeable angular the movement was very slow at first, then gone - the object made no noise at all - the four light panels were all white in color - the objects lights were constant, none flashed - the only thing visible on the object were the light panels, no outline or shape I am positive that I witnessed technology from another world.  It could be the U.S. government behind the scenes, but the technology had to be alien.;38.3876;-107.4824
