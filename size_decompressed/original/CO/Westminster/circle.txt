I looked west at the sunset and above the mountains was a bright light like a star.  It was a little too bright, so I stared at the object for a few.  The bright round star started moving south very slowly.  I thought it was the motion of the car at first because we were moving south but then it started accelerating very quickly while at the same time changing into different colors.  It flash through at least all visible colors ROYGBIV and then shot off, in a flash, it was gone.  It was like a reverse shooting star leaving our atmosphere instead of entering it.  The object was far away somewhere above the Rocky Mountains. I can confirm the object sat still for approximately 20 seconds.  By the time the object started moving, and accelerated, changed many colors, and shot off and disappeared it took less the 10 seconds.  So I watched a total of 30 seconds.  It all happened just north of the railroad tracks on Wadsworth Blvd and 92nd.  I remember going over the tracks right after thinking “what was that?”;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
My friend and i where outside smoking and noticed that there was quite a few falling stars.I was facing to the north and he was facing;2005-01-16 14:00:00;1 min or so;My friend and i where outside smoking and noticed that there was quite a few falling stars.I was facing to the north and he was facing me to the south when all of a sudden his eyes got really big and i ask him what he was looking at and he said There's a real  good one there,as he pointed to the sky behind me.I turned around to look and i saw something in the southern sky that appered to be a nice,bright falling star.The object was falling just as all falling stars do which is kinda straight down.But at some point in it's desent this object totally stopped falling and began moving towards the east in a long S pattern.It continued towards the east until the cloud cover blocked our view.I can honestly say that i do not know what it was that we saw.The only thing that we could think that it could have been if not a ship of some kind,would be that it was a falling object that was burning as it entered the atmospehre(forgive my spelling),and as it was falling and burning it was becomeing lighter,Until it was light enough to be picked up by the jet-stream And carried away.They say that seeing is beliving,well i can honestly say that we saw whatever this thing was.I don't belive that every report on this or any other site are the truth.I belive that a lot of ufo sightings are not true at all.But this one is the truth,and nothing but the truth,so help me god.I truly do not know what we saw the other night.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
Eight circular objects destroyed one of their own.;2006-06-12 16:30:00;5 Minutes;Eight circular objects destroyed one of their own. These 8 objects were white and circular in shape, they moved from side to side up and down with great speed. There were two round shapes on the right side and two round shapes on the left side. With two more circular objects just beneath the other two. The two objects seem to follow the object in the center of all 8. One object moved downward away fron the others and was at a standstill. The other two objects also moved downward and positioned themselves next to the single object...they stood next to the single object for approximatley thirty or forty seconds, then moved away form the single object at an accelerated speed. The other 5 round object just seemed to disappear in mid air. The single object all of a sudden exloded in mid air. I did not see anything falling from the explosion it was just a large ball of fire and then turned into black smoke and it was all over in about five minutes.

Observed three star like objects move at supersonic speeds, one made a u-turn and (N - S) then S - NEN!;2013-07-17 04:05:00;00:04:00;Observed three star like objects move at supersonic speeds, one made a u-turn and (N - S) then S - NEN! Standing on my back porch I noticed (what I can only describe as) several supersonic waves.  I cleaned my glasses and just relaxed my eyes, thinking I was just seeing something natural.   Then I noticed a star blinking white, red, orange, blue, and then a bright white blast, if you will.  Again, I figured it must be natural, due to distance and the atmosphere.   Then the bright white object moved at a speed that was simply unnatural.   I was standing due west, the Flatiron Mountain range is directly in front of me.  The object was positioned at 2 o'clock and raced south to my 10 o'clock position and the made was looked like a u-turn and moved a little slower heading at my 1 o'clock position, towards Boulder.   The night sky was clear and dark from where I was observing.  I often see commercial aircraft approaching Denver International (60 miles approx) and aircraft flying over Denver heading WSW at over 25,000 - 30,000', the three objects were in the 100,000 plus! area!  My Wife came outside after hearing me scream her name, and she watched the third object race from our 11 o'clock and move due north.   The objects moved from point a to b in seconds (5 - 9), I did not have time to run upstairs and get the video camera.   This sighting is a true definition of a UFO, I have no idea what we observed, if they are man made then our military has something that would be revolutionary.   Note:  My Wife has always laughed at the topic of UFO's, until last night.  Not saying she is a believer, just she was truly amazed at what we observed.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563

We parked at this lookout on 82nd and Federal which gave us a full Panoramic view of the city.    About 20 mins in, my 3 year old pushes my head to the east.  I swing my head back and he does it again and points to the sky.  In the sky above  the water tower are 5 bright lights.  They are motionless at first, then all fall a few hundred feet and stop again.  2 of the 5 dissapeared over the city, the remaining 3 formed a perfect triangle.   They hovered for a few moments then 2 of the 3 slowly started descending towards the city until they vanished. When they moved they left tracers that made them look like triangles.  They moved like nothing I've ever seen before.   The remaining light which was the top of the triangle seemed to get brighter.  It stayed for a moment then moved toward the city and vanished.   I was at a lose of words.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
Large orange globe going from south to north along the Ft. Range of Colorado west of the Denver area.;2016-05-05 22:30:00;1 minute+;Large orange globe going from south to north along the Ft. Range of Colorado west of the Denver area. We saw a large orange ball or globe shape last night going from south to north just east of the Front Range in the Westminster, CO area.  It was between Westminster and Boulder, CO.  It moved very quickly to the north making NO sound.  It was lower than the top of the mountain range from my home near Sheridan Blvd. and highway 36.  A neighbor and myself and I watched it until it was out of sight heading towards Ft. Collins, CO.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563

They were all the same size balls or circle shaped objects and they continue to appear out of the sky out of nowhere but the distance between each one was uniform.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
