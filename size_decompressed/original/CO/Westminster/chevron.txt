amber orb chevron fly -by over evening backyard party;2004-06-05 22:00:00;8-10 sec;amber orb chevron fly -by over evening backyard party We were on the back deck of a neighbors home about an hours ago, the deck was facing north and I was looking north west and a chevron of amber orbs came into view moving NW going SSE. I yelled for the other folks on the deck to look up and a group of guys all looked up at once to see the chevron fly by. They were moving faster then a normal fighter jets would. There were no running lights or red and green light you would expect to see on a airplane. As the chevron passed by I noticed a deviation of two orbs moving out of formation and then right back into formation. Since we had music playing through outside speakers I could not distingush a sound factor, I would say the chevron was about 15k up, you would think if they were jets you would have heard something. Knowing that other folks on the deck witnessed this event made me feel much more at easy. We all spoke about the event for a while and drop the subject. This was a very strange event, definitly not planes, jets or satellites, these thing were moving at a very fast rate of speed. At first sight I thought it was one unit, but when the deviation out of formmation happend it seemed they were all separate but moving in tandem with each other.I'm a 51 year old , professional business person. All the other folk involved are all professional business people as well. This was a very intresting experence to say the least.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
It was Wednesday October 14th 2015 somewhere between 8:30-9:00pm. I never thought to check the time.

But when I did it was approx 9:20, and it happened 20-30 minutes before that.   It was a perfectly clear night and I was outside getting ready to light up a cigarette when I noticed an odd dimly lit light in the sky to the northeast just over the neighbors tree line, then it became clear that there were more lights in formation next to it on both sides.  It was very hard to see at first, but as they approached in the sky I could tell they were all part of one object.  Some of the stars were brighter than this object, but as it got closer, I could tell that each one of these lights were bigger than airplane or helicopter lights.  The lights almost gave off a yellowish orangish glow, unlike traditional lights and each light with my best guess were somewhere between 3-5 feet in diameter.  There were no blinking lights.  It was moving at a slow speed and I'm not a good judge of altitude but I would say it was 7,000 to 10,000 feet above the ground traveling from North east to South west.  As it passed almost directly overhead I could finally make out the body of the craft. It was black and was shaped like a V but at 90 degree angles. Nothing in the middle of the craft like the extra diamonds on the stealth bomber.  It was literally a V. As it passed overhead I knocked on the window to call my wife to come out, and stumbled to the back yard to watch it for about 3-4 more seconds before it was gone over the rooftops. It never picked up speed, and it looked like it almost glided over the air.  The object I saw that night never made a sound.  I have 20/20 vision and If I wasn't looking directly at it, I would've never noticed it.  It's almost like it didn't want to be seen.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
Three white lights in chevron formation shoot across sky and then vanish.;2016-02-28 03:48:00;3-4 seconds;Three white lights in chevron formation shoot across sky and then vanish. I observed one object in a chevron shape with 3 lights denoting the shape.  The lights were white, appeared attached to an object.  The lights dropped down, in what I initially thought was a shooting star, but then the lights moved together to the left across the horizon and then just vanished.   The lights were all the same size and shape.  The lights did not appear small and far away, but rather large and relatively close.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
