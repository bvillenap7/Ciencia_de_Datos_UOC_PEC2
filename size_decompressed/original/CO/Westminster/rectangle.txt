Noiseless rectangular object slowly moving.;2019-09-04 22:15:00;10 seconds;Noiseless rectungular object slowly moving. It was past 10pm MST and I was outside on my patio watching sky via binoculars. Visibility was excellent! Noticed rectangular shape object hovering over city at altitude 500 ft ? Object then moved slowly south without making any sound whatsoever!  I could see its dark grayed bottom (via binoculars) and a part of a side.  I think there seems to be light on its side but I cannot confirm that.  Object stopped for a moment then accelerated and very smoothly moved from north to south. We have a small airport few miles away but this was no plane or drone. It had no wings, lights or visible engines.  It was flying directly above me and I couldn't get a full view of it (due to my position).  I estimate its size to be at least 100 ft long and 30 ft wide if not bigger!  Object disappeared into the darkness of the sky and trees...;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
