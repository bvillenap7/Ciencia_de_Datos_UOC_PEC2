A white puffy cottonball appeared and then a triangle emerged from it.  It was totally silent and had a light on each corner.;1993-08-09 23:50:00;1 minute;A white puffy cottonball appeared and then a triangle emerged from it.  It was totally silent and had a light on each corner. A white puffy cottonball appeared toward the northeast at about 40 degrees in the sky, and then a triangle emerged from it.  My husband and I were looking for meteors, and we both saw it.  We were on our deck in the back yard.  It was completely silent and moved slowly from northeast to southwest.  I thought it was electromagnetic because all the hairs on my arms stood straight up like with static electricity from a balloon.  It was spooky.  I thought about running in the house, but I couldn't stop watching it.   It drifted along rather slowly and then stopped, tilted so that the lights appeared to line up, and blinked out.  I saw a red light at each corner of the object, but my husband saw a white light at each corner.  This was the night that the Pope and the President were in Denver (about 15 miles south of us) at Regis University.  There was no air traffic at all while we were outside, which was unusual.  It was about the length of your thumb held at arm's length.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
Triangle craft seen in Westminster Colorado.;2002-04-15 06:30:00;5 MIN;Triangle craft seen in Westminster Colorado. Triangle shape.  Could not make out color.  Low cloud cover that morning.  The craft was flying just inside the cloud.  enough to make out faint outline and lights.  There was a light on the bottom in each of the three corners.  There were also lights at about the midpoint of each side.  Those lights were at the upper and bottom part of the sides.  These lights seem to blink or pulse in a certain pattern while changing colors.  The craft was moving approx. 400 miles/hr, and there was no sound.  The craft flew about 1/8 to 1/4 of a mile to the west of my position, using the clouds for cover.  I would estimate the craft was about 200 to 300 ft above ground.  I watched it until it vanished into the clouds about .5 to 1 mile north of my position.  I noticed the craft when looking at the mountains out of my work window.  I thought it might be a reflection of a passing car or a plane landing at the jeffco airport.  I went outside to rule out reflection, and it was still there.  I ruled out plane when I noticed that it made no sound and was traveling parrelel to the airport runway's.  I also ruled out plane by the way the lights were flashing. My Background, 27yrs old, Engineering Drafter, I believe in ufo's and e.t.  Never seen a ufo and skepticle when I listen to stories.  Never met e.t. as-well.  Associates degree in drafting.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
Couple sees object while looking at Mars.;2003-08-27 00:10:00;10-15 seconds;Couple sees object while looking at Mars. My girlfriend just came home from work and I asked her if she had seen mars (it was a cloudless clear night with Mars as the brightest object in the sky). She didn't pay any attention to it coming home so we went outside on the balcony to look at it. Just as we were looking at Mars a triangular or V-shaped object appeared from the southwest sky and moved towards the northeast. It was a dark gray color, which made it visible in the sky. It wasn't a smooth object but seemed like it had a rough and textured exterior. She asked me if I see that, and I said, Yes. She asked me What it was, and Is that a bird, I stated I don't know, and we watched it move across the sky. It made no sound and had no movement except across the sky. The entire sighting lasted 10-15 seconds at which point it disappeared out of view behind a building.  Afterwards, we kept asking each other what it was. If it was a plane it would have had lights (it didn't) and made some noise. If it was a bird or a flock of birds such as geese it would have had movement and possibly made noise. It did neither. I thought to myself that it could be a satellite but it was too low. I do not believe in UFO's but my girlfriend does. So my only conclusion is a government test plane. But I can not get over the fact that if it was a test plane, why would they fly it over a populated area when people are sure to be looking up at Mars? So I decided to post this to see if anybody else happened to see the same thing.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
Silent, Black Triangle with lights on the corners and amber, glowing lights at rear of craft.;2003-10-25 21:39:00;15 seconds;Silent, Black Triangle with lights on the corners and amber, glowing lights at rear of craft. Just after 9:30pm on 10/25/03 I was standing out on the 2nd floor balcony of my girlfriend's apartment smoking a cigarette and looking out towards the southwest at the stars.  I suddenly noticed the stars disappear momentarily which then transferred my vision on to what caused the effect - a completely dark triangular craft with two or three unblinking red lights, very small lights, on the top of it.  I immediately thought it was an airplane as Jefferson County Airport is only 5-6 miles away, but it was *completely* silent.  It was maybe 3 blocks away from me at an altitude of about 500 feet and traveling no more than 60mph or so.  I'd estimate it's size at about 3 times that of a standard F16 fighter.  It was most definitely not a stealth fighter or a B2  bomber I'm familiar with military and civilian aircraft and this fit none of the profiles.   Once I was able to track it with my vision I followed it's path, which was south, and was able to see three dim white lights at each corner of the triangle.  Also at this time, I was able to see the rear end of the craft which exhibited 3 or 4 (was hard to tell) circular, amber-colored (or glowing amber, I'm not sure) lights.  (I'll email drawing)  Finally, as the craft got farther away and was ready to pass out of sight into some low clouds, I heard a single, very short and very faint whump sound...almost impossible to hear, it was extremely faint and was the only sound I heard during the entire sighting.  I'd estimate the distance at the time of the sound was about 1/2 mile from my location.  If I'd not been watching the craft at the time I never would have noticed it.  That's about it, thanks for your time.  Contact me for more info if needed.  I'll also send a drawing of what I saw.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
