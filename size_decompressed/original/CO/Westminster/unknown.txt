As I was smoking a cigarette, I noticed a bright blue light at about 1 o’clock facing to my North. At first I thought it was a close bright star but it seemed to be a little too bright and big in the sky. The object stood stationary for about a minute and a half, then it turned bright green and zoomed off to the east faster than my head can turn.  By the time I turned my head to follow it the light went away. I don’t know if it turned off or if it disappeared. I never believed in UFO’s or anything like that.  But now I am starting to wonder.  I couldn’t see any kind of shape or anything because the light was so bright.  I am not saying this is a UFO for sure because I don’t know, but I don’t know of any kind of aircraft that can stay in one place, that is that bright, and that can move that fast without any noise at all.

4 lights moving into each other then out again and circling.;2013-07-04 21:45:00;4 minutes;4 lights moving into each other then out again and circling. After the fireworks stopped we noticed helicopters to the right, 3 of them, then noticed 4 of them. Then we noticed how they were moving and how close to each other they were we then knew they were not helicopters.  They were moving into very close to each other then out again. At a couple of times they completely disappeared then came back. We seen many fireworks that night and knew these were not fireworks, we then thought maybe remote controlled helicopters but they were too high for this. Would like to know if anyone else saw these. It was around 2145 military time i believe, give or take 15-20 minutes. And it was in the Westminster area.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
