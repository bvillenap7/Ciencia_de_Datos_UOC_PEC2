We noticed three spherical shaped objects to the east of where we were watching fireworks the evening of the Fourth of July.  They sky was clear and visibility was perfect.  At first it looked like the three objects may have been flying due west in a straight line, but then got into what looked like a triangle shape and begin to almost rotate position while they dropped in altitude  (the top point of the triangle would drop down and one on the bottom would take its place).  The rotation seemed to be fairly slow as all three only made one full rotation.  We observed this pattern until one of the objects on the bottom of the triangle dropped out of our view and the others followed.  The objects were bright white in color.  Also to the east of our location is DIA (Denver International Airport).  At first, we thought it may be planes, but the objectâ€™s flight pattern would be almost impossible for a plane to follow, especially for a commercial plane that would be at DIA.  We also do not think it was helicopters either because the angles at which the objects rotated and then dropped would be too sharp.  Fireworks were happening about two miles west of our location and you had to turn completely around to see these objects.  They were definitely not fireworks, due to their location and that they were visible for much longer than fireworks would ever be.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
