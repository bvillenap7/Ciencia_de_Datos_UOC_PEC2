My name is Dave and I'm 22, my brother and I were young at the time, I being about 6 or seven.   We were coming out of our neighborhood in my mom's car and both noticed somthing at the corner of our eye.  We both looked up at the object and noticed its shape, and suddenly it took off faster like a reflection a mirror makes on a wall when you move it.   It is one of my most rememberable thoughts of that time in my life.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
