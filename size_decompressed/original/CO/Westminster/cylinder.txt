Extremely fast moving, sharp turning object flying;2012-06-07 01:05:00;10 seconds;Extremely fast moving, sharp turning object flying We were outside looking at the thunderstorm over the Denver Metropolitan area, looking west and north west and I saw a long shaped object with exremely fast flashing lights.   At first I thought perhaps it was a plane, but immediately realized that it was moving incredibly fast and the lights were fluttering or flashing at a extreme rate.   As I looked up about the treeline, the object moved west northwest I would say 100x faster than an airplane, which caught my attention so I told my partner to look very quickly, she saw it as well and I lost sight of it, and she continued to see it as it immediately and sharply turned due west.   I then caught it again in my sight as it again turned sharply and immediately southwest.   My partner stated she saw an airplane below the UFO traveling at a much slower rate at in the sky just below the object.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
