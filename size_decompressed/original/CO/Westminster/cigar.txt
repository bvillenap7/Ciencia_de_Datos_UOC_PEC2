cigar shaped segmented flying object sighted over Broomfield / Boulder CO;2006-07-29 13:35:00;1-2 minutes;cigar shaped segmented flying object sighted over Broomfield / Boulder CO I was heading towards US36 on Church Ranch Rd when I saw an object in the skies heading towards the mountains. It was shaped like a fuselage of an airplane and at first thought it to be such. It was very large and difficult for me to deterime just how distant it was. I would guess 2-4 miles. I consider it larger than the biggest of airbusses. I kept looking for a tail fin and tail wings but could not locate either. It was the same for the major wings. This object was segmented into 3 segments. The fore and aft segments were of the same size and color ( silverish-white ). The segment in the middle was approximately 1/3 of their size and white. That would be the part where one would expect to see the major wings of an airplane. I never saw them materialize into wings from my perspective. Other vehicles were around but as usual noone was looking up. I was traveling the entire time and observed it for 1-2 minutes.  It appeared to move a little faster than the largest airplanes I have seen at about the same distance. I am going to guess that this object was about 40 degrees going mostly East to West. The strangest thing about this sighting is that I became disoriented after watching it and I feel that on occasion since then I still have periods of disorientation or confusion, if you will, in my work that is not normally present. The background was mostly sunny with partial clouds. I never saw this go thru the clouds.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
