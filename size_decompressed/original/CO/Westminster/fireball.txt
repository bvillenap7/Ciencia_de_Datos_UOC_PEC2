These objects were noticed by several others around us in the field and there were a lot more people that had to have seen them as well.   after spotting these objects i told my wife to give me her phone and i got them on video.  I have never seen a ufo but have always wanted to, I am not very gullible and very honest,  I know what I have seen and am very excited to say that I myself have seen extra terrestrial craft.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
