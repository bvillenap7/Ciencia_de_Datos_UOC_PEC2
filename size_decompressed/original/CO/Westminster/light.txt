White light like falling star appears to hit earth;2015-03-07 20:00:00;~5 seconds;White light like falling star appears to hit earth At 8:00 pm, I was driving home, headed south.  I was heading up a slight hill, only minutes from my house.   In  front of me, in the sky, I saw a bright white light, the shape of a star, but too big and close.  It looked more like a white light from an airplane.  However, it was falling at a rapid angle like a shooting star.  I watched it fall, thinking it looked like it could hit a house.   Then the light suddenly went completely out.  I thought maybe I had seen a real meteor hitting the earth in my area or maybe a distressed plane had gone down.   But there was no crash or engine noise.   I have no idea what I saw!;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
Massive cluster of tiny lights moving together over the skies of Westminster, CO.;2017-08-26 20:00:00;15 minutes;Massive cluster of tiny lights moving together over the skies of Westminster, CO. On the evening of Saturday, August 26th, at 8:45pm, some friends of mine and myself noticed a large cluster of tiny color-changing lights in the sky.  These lights traveled as if following the same path, and seemed to glisten like a moon shimmering off the top of the ocean.  It was a spectacular sight, truly the most amazing spectacle I have ever viewed.   There was an incredible number of these lights flicker across the sky, so I estimated the number to be around 100 or so... not sure if these were individual lights or if perhaps they may have been attached to one giant craft of some sort.   I took video of this occurrence, however, due to the smallness of the lights and the high altitude of their placement, they are not visible from my phone camera.  I have no clue as to what these various lights might have been.  Some of my friends suggested perhaps they were a cluster of drones, however, I felt there were way too many for that conclusion to be feasible.  I am truly stumped by this magnificent sight.;39.8663211267605;-105.042626760563
