I was looking north over the top of our house there were several planes towards the south where the regional airport is and DIA. I saw a bright light which I believed to be another plane coming from the north west towards southeast. I was watching it and realized there were no lights around it flashing like a plane and it was going faster then a plane but not as fast as a falling star and it was heading more up then down like a star would. I yelled at my wife to take a look but she didn’t hear me. The object(light) then started fading till it almost disappeared then became a red streak then disappeared. There were no clouds in the sky so it didn’t go behind or above a cloud. That was all I saw from that point on. The whole thing probably took a minute or two.;39.7569;-104.4266
