My co-workers and I were working on the spotlight towers today at an outdoor amphitheatre when I looked to the west and saw something hovering in the air just below the storm cloud moving in.  After it kinda hovered and moved around a little bit, it suddenly broke up into 4 smaller shiny silver colored discs and was moving around in a diamond formation.   As my 2 co-workers and I looked at it, we said are they birds? but they were too shiny in the sky and there wasn't really any sun hitting them, besides, birds fly in formation, not hover, and they were about 6-8 miles away anyway.  They couldn't have been fighter jets because jets are usually travelling very fast and don't hover, especially in formation.  As they kind of floated there somemore, they suddenly all 4 disappeared up into the storm cloud.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706

Circular object in the sky above Denver;2009-08-18 04:04:00;15 seconds;Circular object in the sky above Denver Tuesday August 18, 2009 04:04 am approx. Englewood Colorado    I was standing my on my front porch which faces north. I had gone out to have a cigarette and was looking at the sky listening to crickets. I saw an object in the sky approximately 80 degree angle from looking horizontally. I was almost staring straight up when I saw what at first what I thought it was an aircraft of some sort, but it was moving too fast to be an aircraft. Next I thought it was a meteorite slowly coming into and atmosphere moving west to east but as it cleared my position it made a hard angle like turn to the northward direction and disappeared behind the tree my neighbor has. There were no flashing lights on the object like aircraft would have. There was no sound emitted from the craft and I knew meteorites do not usually make hard left hand turns like this had done. This left me with a feeling like I had seen something quite unique and not of this world. I knew I should write this out so that I may save the utmost detail of the event. I also wanted to ha! ve it on record should someone else report something strange in the skies about Denver on this morning. I am available to contact should you have further questions about this event. Current time of this writing is 04:17 on the same day.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
