I noticed glowing orange disks flying from south to north toward the western sky.  There were a group of them and I noticed more coming.   I realized they didn't look like planes or helicopters so I stopped my car so I could look at them more carefully.  They didn't make any noise and looked like they were floating across the sky...it looked like they flew higher and then disappeared.   Other cars driving by were looking up pointing at them.   I called my neighbor on my cell phone and told him to hurry and look toward the west to witness them.  He and his wife saw them...he got his binoculars and said they looked like neon orange disks.  There was a group of them... then a line of them and finally one straggler.  I called the 9 news station to see if anyone had called it in... I hope there is an explanation I have never seen anything like that!   I am a register nurse...my neighbor is a contractor and his wife is a retired postal supervisor.   We're pretty open minded people but I can't say that we've talked about flying saucers. I sure have NO explaination for what we saw...the hair is still standing up on my arms!!!!;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
