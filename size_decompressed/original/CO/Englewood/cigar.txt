Blue & White flashing UFO over Englewood,CO 5/27/2011;2011-05-27 20:00:00;30-45 sec.;Blue & White flashing UFO over Englewood,CO 5/27/2011 Me and my buddy were driving east bound on highway 285 near Simms St.  When my buddy noticed a weird object hovering about 100-150 ft. off the ground.  It was a long cigar shaped object flashing white lights, then blue lights, and white..ect.  It would shoot up and down at rates of speed no human structure could ever pull off, then it would shot right really fast and up and down. at the end of the sighting it zipped from around Simms St. West towards the mountains, west.   About 3-4 miles away in about 3 seconds flat.  Weirdest ((stuff)) i have ever seen!;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
