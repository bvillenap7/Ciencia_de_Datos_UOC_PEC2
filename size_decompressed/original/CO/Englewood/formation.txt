Multiple flying objects put on an airshow!;2002-09-13 20:10:00;15-17 min;Multiple flying objects put on an airshow! 8pm - sky is dark and clear. My wife and I are on the patio watching the sky for satellites. I see what appears to be a satellite traveling west to east which is rare in our area. Then, I notice what appears to be another satellite following the first - but it seems to be catching up to the first, then backing off. After these satellites disappeared, we watched as 10-15 red objects about the size and shape of a match head held at arms length came into view exactly over our house flying looping and curling patterns from roughly SW to NE. There was no sound and the objects appeared to be relatively high - over 20K-30k feet. These objects were followed through the sky by 4 larger round discs flying straight and parallel from SW to NE. The red objects moved around the discs in varying patterns of loops and curves. Again, no sound. We waited to post our sighting hoping to see other reports in the paper or media to confirm what we saw but none have appeared. What an airshow! Absolutely the most amazing sight we have ever witnessed.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706

Looked about 1,000 ft. in elevation and a few hundred feet apart. The movement was slow at about 20 mph with a heading of NE tracking over Centennial airport. All lights were white and about as bright as the stars in the sky. They made no noise and didn't exhibit any movement besides the straight line track. I saw the trail end.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
