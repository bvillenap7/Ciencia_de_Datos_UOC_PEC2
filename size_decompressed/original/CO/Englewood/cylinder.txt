The OBJECT was at a 10 to 20 degree angle from the intersection of QUINCY AND NAVAJO, and seemed to hover at about 500 to 600 feet above the ground. I turned left, parked and got out of my car. With me I had a 2 to 5 power monocular. Using a fence to steady the image, I could tell the object was indeed a cylinder, flat-black and approx. 50 to 60 FEET LONG and the WIDTH was about 1/4 of it's length. It did appear to have TWO ANTENNA'S in seperate places on it's surface. It would HOVER not moving for awhile then start to TUMBLE in place. When the tumble would stop it would either just sit still or ZIP VERY FAST to the EAST or to the WEST always returning to the original spot. It seemed to cover about 8 times it's length in less than a second. NO SOUND was apparent. Sighting was AT LEAST 20 minutes.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706

When I had this sighting, I tried to do a report right after it happened, but I was at work and this website is blocked were I work. I never wrote down the date or time but I will never forget it was the last Thursday of April 2013, at 11:30 PM MST. I work 2nd shift at a manufacturing plant 3:30 PM to 12:00 AM. I smoked at the time and went outside to have a smoke shortly before quitting time. I was sitting on a folding chair just outside the door and looked up to the West and saw a very strange light coming directly towards me. It was not far away and I did not take my eyes off it. Were I was sitting there is a East-West street 15 feet in front of me. When I spotted it, it was about 200 yards to the west. It just came cruising west to east over the street in front of me at about 150 yards high. It was about the size of a railroad freight car and shaped like a Tylenol pill. It was very dark except the bottom that was burnt orange and dark and looked like the shadows like you would see on a bumpy gourd. It just silently cruised by to the east until it got about 300 yards east and I could not see it any more.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
