The objects were white and rectangular shaped and traveled from the south to the north at a very fast speed without making noise.  The objects flew parallel to the horizon.  After the first object disappeared the second one appeared in the same spot at the same trajectory. We saw them from the third floor of our apartment complex.  The object appeared to be far away.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
