Blue ball with red, orange and yellow glowing brightly from center.;2015-01-11 15:35:00;3 minutes;Blue ball with red, orange and yellow glowing brightly from center. Walked outside to take trash out.  Noticed object right away, it was just getting dark.  To the south-east, saw what looked like a hot air balloon shape, a blue circle at the bottom and the top glowing fierce, shaped like a hot air balloon, but was bright flaming red with yellow, orange.   I called my boyfriend out and ran in to get my phone, snapped a photo (did not come out very good).  Ran back in to grab better camera.  I turned camera on and the object just went black, just a black floating ball.  Then it was gone!   I came in and painted a picture of what it looked like.  It was too high to be a balloon, and it was almost dark.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
Big blue starlike object in the sky.;2015-01-22 19:35:00;3-4 seconds;Big blue starlike object in the sky What I saw tonight (Jan 22) was extremely similar to what the woman who filed a report on January 11th wrote about.   I was stepping outside for a smoke when I saw it.  A big blue ball with and an orange and yellow aura around it was glowing really bright.   I thought it was a shooting star or something at first, but it seemed bigger than the typical meteor I've seen before.  It was only visible for a few seconds and was moving really fast.  It was north from where I was and moving westbound.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
