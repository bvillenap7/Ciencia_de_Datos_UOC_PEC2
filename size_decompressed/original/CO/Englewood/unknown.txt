I saw a large metallic glow very very far in the sky.  I initially thought it was a satellite.  30 minutes later while I was realing in my kite I noticed the object again in the same spot.  Except this time, there were 3 smaller silver metallic objects very close to the larger one.  I was totally stunned and I knew something very strange was going on.  I dropped my kite and I stared at it.  A few minutes later I noticed the smaller ships were moving.  One of them totally disappeard.  The other 2 began to fly off away from the bigger ship together.  They were flying together off.  A cloud finally flew over and I waited for the cloud to move away.  5 minutes later after the cloud floated away, I could no longer see any of the objects.  This was very frightening because I have seen sattelites before in the sky.  This object was extremely high.  If they remained still one could almost say there were stars, but they began moving around and the smaller ones quickly flew away from the larger object.  I'm being 100% totally serious here.  I cannot think of any military weapon that this might be.  It was obviously some kind of dock or mother ship and three smaller craft flew out of or away from the larger one.

Invisible aircraft;2008-12-15 07:30:00;1 minute;Invisible aircraft It was about 7:30 AM on the morning of the 15th of December, so the sun was just coming up and I was on the west-side of our building just looking up at the moon (I have become a pretty avid sky-watcher as of late and when you are alone it is just kind of enjoyable to look at the stars and moon etc.) and all of a sudden there were four lights just popped into the sky. They were in formation and equidistant from one another. They were flickering like what I would call afterburners on a jet from behind but there was nothing there. The only thing you could see is the four lights and they stayed exactly the same as it traversed from North to South right over us here. I watched thinking maybe I was looking at some birds that were reflecting the early morning sun, but then I saw a bird fly by and it looked totally different. These lights went South for about 20 seconds, not really fast but at a steady rate until they just poofed out of existence. I am absolutely certain that what I saw was not a natural phenomenon. It was four lights attached to something that was apparently invisible. Yesterday here in Denver Colorado it was a record cold day and I was actually wondering if maybe it was something we have built with some kind of new stealth technology but because of how cold it was out the exhaust was unable to be hidden. One last comment is that whatever I saw was close enough to me for me to notice that is made absolutely NO SOUND. I am going to watch with my camera in hand when I go outside from now on just in case I see it again I can photograph it for analysis. Oh, and another thing, I usually do not go outside at that time so maybe I had not ever seen it before because of the timing so I am going to go out at the same time again for a while to see if I can catch it. I will update with photo if I do get so lucky as to see it again. As of today I have not seen anything like it again.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
UFO with whirring red, blue, and green light spotted stationary in the sky below orion's belt.;2012-12-03 23:00:00;Ongoing;UFO with whirring red, blue, and green light spotted stationary in the sky below orion's belt. It is now 11:32 p.m. MST, 12/03/2012.  For over the past thirty minutes I have seen a bright light between Orion's Belt and the horizon, south-southeast from my location.  From the naked eye, it looks like the shimmering of colored light you get when you look at an airplane with it's red and green lights flashing in the distance, but it has barely moved.  A friend had told me it moved a short distance before stopping again all before he contacted me to take a look for myself.  The best way to describe the view from the naked eye is that of an atom.  Imagine seeing white light like a star (atom) with red, green and blue electrons whirring around it like quick lights flashing on a police car.   Looking through a telescope, it appeared as if there could be one light, or several ones close together.  It looked like there were three lights formed into some kind of triangular shape, but I didn't have sufficient magnification to make out a distinct arrangement.   At one point, I thought I had seen this triangular shape turning and transforming, like an unstable particle in the sky.  Other witnesses besides myself are 2 friends of mine, one of which told me and the other I informed myself, and a friend of one of them from Texas.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
Four bright orange lights dancing in sky after cherry hills country club fireworks.;2014-07-04 21:40:00;Unknown;Four bright orange lights dancing in sky after cherry hills country club fireworks After watching fireworks at cherry hills country club in englewood, co, I noticed my car alarm going off.  Upon returning from disarming it, I noticed 4 bright lights flying in irregular patterns, almost fluttering like a flag in the wind.  I was facing east from the hole closest to where Oxford lane becomes restricted.   By no means am I a professional but I have never seen anything like it before.   They disappeared below trees out of our view but lasted long enough for me to run to car, get mom, and show her. We're orangish in color, like a street light.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706

It moved north at an amazing rate of speed to completely out of sight in less than approximately 2-3 seconds.   Its trajectory was constant, totally parallel.  No sound at all.  Absolutely was not an plane or jet.   Inside of 30 minutes afterwards a military fighter jet flew over the same area of my sighting but was traveling west.  Seemed odd to hear a fly-by from a fighter jet in the evening.  Not typical in this area.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706

I saw Red light traveling slowly, moving slightly to the right and left.  The shape is unknown.  It was moving from the southwest to the northeast and appeared to be descending.  By the time it reached where I was standing it may have been about 100 to 150 feet in the air and hovered over me for a few seconds and then moved on.  There was not sound. The light reminded me of a fire that was just glowing cinders, like sparkling sort of.  I watched as it passed out of my sightâ€¦a total of 3 minutes.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
