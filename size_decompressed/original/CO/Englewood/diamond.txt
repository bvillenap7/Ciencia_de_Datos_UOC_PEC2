He said look up the sky then he started to count....1001, 1002...when he reach 1020, I told him lets go in but he tapped my hand and said stay, he proced counting until he counted 1039, and there it goes over our head aboout 15 to 20,000 feet on a clear and quiet night we saw a purple redish color shape like a diamond came from south going north.Two parallel object flying over us, there was no sound and glided straight and smoothly throu the air about 5 to 6 seconds. I've never seen something like it, It somewhat amazes me to see something like that but when I see it with my own two eyes, I can't believe it! It seems normal to him because he'd seen it many times. He said he just want to show it to me so to believe him. and tell himself that his not going crazy. He's been seeing this objcts since he was 12 years old. He try to tell his family and friends but nobody believed him. when I saw it with my own two eyes I believe him, and I can't explain what I saw. He said  he had this kind of feelings when it happens. and this night is just one of them.;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
