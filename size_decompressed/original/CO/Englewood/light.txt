Too bright to be a star, so I grabbed my Handicam and started shooting.;2004-01-22 20:00:00;4 minutes;Too bright to be a star, so I grabbed my Handicam and started shooting. My third floor apartment faces west toward the front range of the Rocky Mountains. Something told me to look out my bedroom window and I saw an unusually bright light above the illuminated Cross on the East side of Lindo mountain,Colorado. The object was much too bright to be a star. The small object flying off the larger bright object is flying off in the direction of Lockheed Martin Aerospace Corp. which is just a few miles away, almost due south.Lockheed Martin Aerospace built the Martian Rover landers as well as the Stardust spacecraft. It was cold and I was dressed in a T-shirt, sweat pants and socks which is why there is camera shake. If I would have had advance notice I would have used a tripod.<grin> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded about the object with the witness.  We believe the object may have been a celestial body, possibly, that descended behind the mountains to the west, although the witness disagrees with our assessment.  The second anomalous object he cites in the video appears to us to be an aircraft with strobe lights.  PD));39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
