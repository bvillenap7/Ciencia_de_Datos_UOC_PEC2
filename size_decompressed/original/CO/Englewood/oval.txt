There really are ET's I will only tell you this, I saw it clearly and for several minutes! I clearly saw three aliens in the ship they stopped an watched me for about 15 minutes! I lived on the third floor,The ship was about the size of an egg and shaped like one, it was gold with 5 black  stripes grayish wind screen. They were looking at me through what appeared to be a wrap around picture screen They did not wave or make any movements, I never saw their hands, they stood side by side. The third one on my right suddenly turned to it's left and they shoot off to my right. There was a stairway 20 feet in front of them when they took off and they dodge it in the nick of time and headed off towards the west! The craft made no noise or had any kind of flame shooting out of it! But it made a gold colored trail as it flew away! I made a drawing right after they left. I would describe them but wouldn't believe me!;39.6214055147059;-104.937399264706
