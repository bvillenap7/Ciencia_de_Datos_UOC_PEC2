It appeared fairly close, but made zero noise.  I noticed some movement in the corner of my eye and when I moved my head to look at it, I noticed it was something like I've never seen before.  The 6 lights were either separate objects, or separate lights on a single object.  They moved in perfect synchronization.  I had my cell phone with me, but by the time I opened the camera app, the object was gone.;40.3803;-104.6953
Transparent triangular craft flying northbound spotted in Evans Colorado;2016-05-03 21:14:00;15 seconds;Transparent triangular craft flying northbound spotted in Evans Colorado I noticed faint movement in the northern sky traveling north at an alarming speed.  I was able to lock in on the craft but it was almost as if it were transparent and all I was seeing was the triangular outline.   I watched it for about 15 seconds waiting for some kind of light or any other familiar characteristics of human craft but I struggled to see anything other than a vivid triangular outline.  It seemed to be picking up speed insanely quick and I couldn't see it anymore.   It was also flying pretty low, maybe 7-20 thousand feet in the air if I had to guess;40.3803;-104.6953

The lights.... randomly rotating around each other as it silently moved across the sky south to north and vanished.... sounds exactly like one of the other recent reports from Loveland, CO, which is not too far from me.. wild!;40.3803;-104.6953
Triangle shape created by 3 bright steady white lights/orbs over Evans, Colorado.;2020-11-07 18:45:00;Steady;Triangle shape created by 3 bright steady white lights/orbs over Evans, Colorado. I have seen 3 lights in a perfect triangle over the Evans, Colorado, area twice.  Once with my kids about 2 weeks ago and tonight.  They are steady and one seems to fade in and out. They are not blinking or have flashing lights.  They are round orb shaped and perfectly spaced apart. The lights are white. They look light extremely bright stars.;40.3803;-104.6953
