UFO siting 10/18/2019  We were standing on the balcony of our room at the Far View Lodge in Mesa Verde National Park in Cortez, Colorado on October 18, 2019 at dusk, just before 7pm. The hotel is 15 miles inside of the park, so we were very isolated and miles away from all building, street or car lights. The balcony faces south and we had just photographed the sun setting in the west at 6:30pm. After the sun had gone down, yet still light, we were commenting on how dark and clear it was without any buildings or street lights for miles. We looked up and it was not yet totally dark. We commented on the amazing view and the distance we could see. There were no clouds in the sky, as my photos will show, and no stars were out yet.  My friend and I were looked out and saw 3 lights in the shape of a triangle right in front of us.  It was flashing, then 2 of the lights on one side stopped flashing then quickly disappeared. The one remaining light got brighter then went out completely. I saw nothing else in the sky. No planes, no stars, no clouds.  My friend and I looked at each other and stated that we had both seen the same thing at the same time. It lasted less than 30 seconds in total.;37.3578;-108.5802
