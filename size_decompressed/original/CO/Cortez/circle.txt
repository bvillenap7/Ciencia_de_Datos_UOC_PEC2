My wife and I were outside our friend's house located west of Cortez, CO.  She noticed a bright, star-like object moving from the south of us, below the Big Dipper.  It appeared the size of a large planet, and was bright white. It was about at a 60 degree elevation, and moving very quickly across the sky above us, moving at toward the NE from the SW direction.  It maintained a straight path to about midhorizon, when it appeared to zip and zag, to our utter amazement. By this time, a couple of minutes, it had moved across nearly 60% of the visible sky (which was crystal clear).  We then saw it slow down, and begin a 90 degree turn, taking it toward the NE (toward Durango direction).  As it went into that direction, it appeared to brighten and dim slowly, at one point flashing beams from it.  Then as it neared about 30 degrees from our point of view, it disappeared.  In size it would be taken as a planet or star.  It appeared to be very high.  It left no tail or trace of its path.;37.3578;-108.5802
Two objects appearing as plantets in photos from the moon etc., appear in place of a white cloud in the north west sky, well after suns;2004-07-20 21:00:00;20 min;Two objects appearing as plantets in photos from the moon etc., appear in place of a white cloud in the north west sky, well after suns After sunset, towards the northwest, against a backdrop of rain storm, a white cloud stayed white long after the sun disappeared, and after sunset.  I wathced the cloud, begining as a little puff, horizontal but very white, it began to drift down towards the earth and divided into two forks, which I thought might be a tornado.  This is why I took the photo.    I took the snapshot on my digital camera, stepping out the back door.  You can see the 8 foot board fence, which gives an idea of elevation of the objects in the sky.    When I downloaded the photo, the cloud is not apparent, but these two objects are visible.  I did not see them, they must have been obscured by the wispy white cloud, but I don't see how.  They did not appear to move, the cloud eventually disappeared or disappated.;37.3578;-108.5802
