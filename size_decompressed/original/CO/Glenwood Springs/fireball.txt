We were star gazing, watching for meteors.  Saw five or six shooting stars.  Then around 2300 hrs., we saw what we thought was another shooting star that kept going, and then at the last second it darted back and forth in a zig-zag motion, shot straight up and disappeared.  It was red in color the entire time, and came from the Southwest sky, went right below Jupiter (from our vantage point) and continued going East until it bounced back and forth before disappearing.  It was small in size (same size as the meteors we saw) and there was no noise.  Again, we thought it was just another meteor that was taking its time burning out until it did its zig zag motion.;39.5298523809523;-107.327171428571
