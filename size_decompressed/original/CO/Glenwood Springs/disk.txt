A disk object was hovering in the early morning sky.  It had two rows of red lights.  After a minute or two it slowly descended and I could see it near the ground through the trees for a brief time.  Estimated distance and tree width led me to surmise craft was about 6-10 feet across.;39.5298523809523;-107.327171428571
