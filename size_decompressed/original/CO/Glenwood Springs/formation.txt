WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT WAS? ((NUFORC Note:  May not be a serious report.  PD));2005-05-03 22:03:00;23 seconds;WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT WAS? My Girlfriend and I are sitting in our hottub kicking back and looking at the mountain range and stars. It was a bit patchy out but there was a break for about 2 miles all of a sudden we thought we saw a flock of Geese break out of the clouds. Living in this area for 25 years I know Geese do not fly this late and when they do fly it is down close to the river and you can here them.  This craft was goverment or other but no *&%^&( Geese this was sillent.  We have never witnessed anything like this before and now WE KNOW SOMETHING OR SOMEONE IS OUT THERE? YOU TELL US? ((NUFORC Note:  Given the profanity that was present in this report, in its unedited form,  we have to wonder whether this is a serious report, or an attempt to hoax.  We are not certain what the witness intended for the report.  PD));39.5298523809523;-107.327171428571
Pair of dull red lights silently fly over Glenwood Springs, CO;2009-03-16 21:00:00;30 seconds;Pair of dull red lights silently fly over Glenwood Springs, CO On Monday March 16th 2009 two dull red orbs were seen traveling silently directly above our group who was sitting in the back yard. The 2 distinct glowing items were around the size of a thumbnail at arms length. Their glow was diffuse so that they did not look yo be a sharp singular point of light but more like a glowing object. It was hard to discern their altitude. But there was an impression that they were close because of their speed. This did not really seem close because of their speed.  They took around 20-30 seconds to travel across the sky. At the end of their course through the sky the lights crossed and then split into 3 before going behind a tree.
