So I pulled off I-25 (mead exit) on the off ramp.looking toward the east (three in a triangle shape,at first they were all white then changed to one  Red, Green and White.each) constant, not flashing.   So I shut off the motor and lights,got out  and just watched. ...then it changed from three evenly spaced lights to an elongated triangle.. (the lights at each corner, kinda like clearance lights of a truck) from the distance it had to be maybe a half mile long.  (I seem to be the only one who noticed. no one else stopped. ....after about 10 min it still hadn't changed.  So I was. (getting ancy about being late for work)  But still watching, then all of a suddenâ€¦   It turned up on one side,moved 90 degrees (turning away from me) all in less than a second. (remember very big) and started moving away.(no sound) to the East. At the rear of it was two white clam shaped pods,with little dotted lines thru the middle of both.(assumed it was the propulsion system..... I could see heat waves between it and me. As it got further away,it turned SE.  Then beyond it there was a horizontal plane of white light with an red opaque top to it in the shape of a cockpit. (much larger than the triangle) and flashing red lights swarming all around it. moving further away.  Did i mention where I first saw the triangle shape was in the close vicinity of a decommissioned n power plant.... I have heard before of sightings around things of that nature;40.2353;-104.9942
