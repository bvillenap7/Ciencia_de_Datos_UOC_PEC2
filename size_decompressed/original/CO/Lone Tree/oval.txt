Green light falling from the sky, green impact!;2015-10-02 22:50:00;5-15 seconds;Green light falling from the sky, green impact! Driving home from working at a local mall in Lone Tree, Co.  I have taken this route everyday for like 3 years.  It's a bit cloudy out and I'm at a stop light on a highway.   Pulling up to a red light all of a sudden I see this green thing shaped like a oval falling from the sky.  It was like two seconds and it was gone, but it was falling it looked like it could be a meteor.  I waited for a second at the stop light, didn't hear anything but as soon as it turned green to go, this green mist was under the car as I was moving.  It's like when an explosion happens and the impact is visible, that is what the green mist thing was.  Now I'm not sure if it was that, don't think it was a meteor because we most likely would have felt it and I for sure know it was not just something in my head if I'm going to this length to actually submit it.  Could be a Nuke, green droid who knows but all I know is that it was green and a few seconds later that impact hit me and it was like nothing I've ever seen before.  When the green impact hit it felt like time stopped for a second then the car next to me sped up and left! (It was a nice Porsche and I'm in a suv).   I live by DIA, but this was not by it at all and trust me, weird things happen in the sky around my area too, just never saw anything until now!
