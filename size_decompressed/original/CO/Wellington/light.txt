Silent Bright White Light Spotted in sky seems to disable phone and vehicle;2015-04-29 20:44:00;4 minutes;Silent Bright White Light Spotted in sky seems to disable phone and vehicle. At around dusk on Wed 29 April, I was driving south from Wellington, Colorado, on County Road 13, along the Larimer/Weld County Line. Just North of County Road 96 I see a silent bright white light in the Southern sky. I then stopped my vehicle along the side of the road.  As Iâ€™m stopped along the side of the road, I notice the bright white light moving north towards my vehicle then back South, alternating its movement closer and farther away from my position in a continuous North and South direction. After about one minute (at around 20:44 MST), I flash my headlights on and off about 10 times. The light then started moving straight towards me at a seemingly average aircraft speed of about 100 miles per hour.  As the silent object gets about one quarter mile away from me and about 350 feet up in the air, I then decided to try and capture video footage with my phone. After about 2 seconds into the video recording, my phone and vehicle shut down simultaneously.  The silent object then flies directly over me.  When the bright white light proceeds north and is approximately one quarter mile away from my position, my cell phone powered itself back on without me pressing the power button.  I then was able to start my vehicle without any issues, and proceed east along County Road 96 losing sight of the bright white light.;40.7279;-105.035
