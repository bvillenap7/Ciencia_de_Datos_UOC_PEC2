The objects crossed paths and appeared to fade and brighten.  The whole time there was at least two lights that were brighter. The colors changed from green, to red, and to a bright white. Looking through binoculars, the objects appeared to be almost spinning, one side looked green, the other side looked reddish with a trail.  Periodically one would brighten and look like a fireball. These objects appeared to be changing positions, hovering over the Loveland area, then switching to a location over the Windsor-Greeley area. This occurred for approximately 25 minutes on 27 Dec 2013 (1815-1840 MST);40.7279;-105.035
