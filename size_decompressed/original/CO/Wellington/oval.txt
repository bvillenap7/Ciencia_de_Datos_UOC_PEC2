Lime green glowing oval shaped bright light seen over Wellington, CO;2008-10-28 20:00:00;4 seconds;Lime green glowing oval shaped bright light seen over Wellington, CO I was watching TV and out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright lime green glowing oval light drop down from the top left corner of my living room window and it disappeared behind the neighbors house. When I turned my head it was in the middle section of my window and then it was gone.   The pattern of which it dropped looked like a meteor, but I know meteors don't glow green.    I jumped up to look out the window and didn't see anything.  The size of the light was about the size of the street light on the street behind our house, probably about 4-5 inches in diameter (with the glow), in an oval shape.  We have one of those honeycomb see-through shades which was down so I have no idea how far away it was.  I can't be certain of course if it was a UFO, but I have never seen anything else like it.  The length of time from it dropping from the top corner of my window until it disappeared behind the neighbors house was probably 3-4 seconds.   The time it occurred was between 7:45-8:00PM.  I am reporting this to see if anyone else saw anything. ((NUFORC Note:  I believe that some meteors are green, if they contain copper.  PD));40.7279;-105.035
