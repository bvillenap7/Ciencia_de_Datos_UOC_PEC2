Red, white and blue flashing lights in the Northern sky above Wellington, Colorado.;2013-10-25 08:15:00;45+ minutes;Red, white and blue flashing lights in the Northern sky above Wellington, Colorado. I glanced out the window at the Northern sky and saw some lights flashing.  At first I thought it was an airplane because of the lights, but then I realized it wasn't moving.  As I watched it longer, I saw that there were red, blue and white lights flashing in a column.   When we first stepped outside, it was at about 30 degrees East from direct North.  45 minutes later, it's at about 60 degrees East from direct North.  It continues to hover there making no sound.  A friend reported seeing a flash of light come off the object heading east at a high rate of speed, and disappearing from the line of sight within seconds.;40.7279;-105.035
