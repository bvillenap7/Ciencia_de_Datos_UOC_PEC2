Lightening struck behind it and i watched it slightly darker then its surroundings (storm was moving east, it moving south- this caught my attention).  Once I zeroed in on it, I could see it plainly.  I could see through it(mountains behind it) but the outline of vessel was clearly visible, triangular in shape, middle more translucent then outside with 3 circles on each  corner, no lights on.  It moved close to me and i could tell size was the same size as a cessna used to crop dust in this area at about same height which is lower then other planes.  It moved smoothly an! d quickly out of sight just above tree line.;40.7279;-105.035
