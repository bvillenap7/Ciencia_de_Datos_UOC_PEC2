Huge and out of nowhere;2002-02-10 22:30:00;NOT SURE;Huge and out of nowhere Clear night sky, I remember little if any moon.  A friend and I were outside, maybe six miles east of the Utah/Co. border on what was highway 666.  I looked up and to the north there low in the sky was a huge ship.  I can only say that it was huge possibly the size of 20-25 blimps.  Perhaps 300-400yards up.  I asked my friend, Do you see that?  Oh my god yes I do was her only response.  It had as best as I can describe a stealth look to it. It seemed to have uncloaked as some of its basic points were in alignment with certain stars.  I do not remember anything else about this at that time.  I have always had an open mind as to the possibilities of ufo's.  I think my mind was overwhelmed and shut down instead of dealing with what I had witnessed.  Over the next year I tried to talk to my fellow sighter several times about this event wanting to confirm it.  She, as I recall evaded the issue and would not speak about.  She, on the other hand says she tried to speak to me about several times over the next year or so and I was reluctant to talk about it. We have a mutual friend who says we both tried to get the other one to talk about but had little luck in doing so.  She has added that it got extreemly quiet as this sighting was occuring.  I do not remember that nor do either of us remember how the sighting ended.  The duration of the event and the timeline following it are extreemly cloudy and unsure.  I have no feelings that an abduction occured. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));37.7604;-108.9215
