The objects zipped around like fire flies changing direction instantly then hovering in one spot. All objects flashed either red and green lights, or red and white lights. There was no jet sound at all. We watched the objects for approximately fifteen minutes as they moved first to the north, then east then west. They changed direction quicker than any plane could. When they left they went different directions. A few momments after they disappeared a single point of light crossed from south east to north west, again with out any noise. As the light disappeared to the north west a passenger jet flew over. That was the first jet sound we heard during this whole time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  He appears to us to be quite familiar with the area of the incident.  PD));40.2557;-106.9309
