I was driving down County Road 14 to State 131 in Routt Co., Colorado, when I noticed a light in the sky.  We have a number of trains in the area and the best description I can give is that it was a slow moving train driving over the top of the Flattops ( a high plateau mountain range).  There are no train tracks on the top of the Flattops.  It was about 4 am with no other vehicles on the highway.  There is no train that crosses the Flattops.  I was so intranced, that, even having to catch a flight in Denver, I stopped to watch. I have driven the road many times since and never had the same visual experience.  Years later I told a friend who described a light darting from the hills while she was walking in Vail.  We only communicate rarely, maybe once a year, but I was stunned that both of us would have experienced an unusual light.  It was not until tongiht when I say the UFO special with Peter Jennings that I decided to do anything about my siting.  At first I thought I was following a star, but when I stopped it was more than evident that there was a moving object.  If this will help, please use it.  The dates are very fuzzy and I am only guessing, but if this adds to the data base all to the good. I know the time of day, but the year is in question.  I communited from Oak Creek to Denver from 1993 until 2000 traveling the same highway.  During that time I lived in NYS.;40.2557;-106.9309
