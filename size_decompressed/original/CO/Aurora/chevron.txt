Small Chevron shaped craft hovered silently above me at 200 ft. then zigged and zagged NW across Aurora.;1977-07-30 03:00:00;2 - 3 minutes;Small Chevron shaped craft hovered silently above me at 200 ft. then zigged and zagged NW across Aurora. Walking on Highline Canal path near Hinkley High School I noticed a small blinking light in the night sky.  At first I thought it was the light of a commercial aircraft at 20,000 ft. until it jiggled slightly up and down.  When the peripheal of my vision opened around the light I realized the light was at the bottom of a rectangular white craft slilently hovering approx. 200 ft. above me. Just above the tree line and above an apartment building. I stopped dead in my tracks, Rubbed my eyes and realized it was not an illusion.  The bottom of the craft as well as the sides were flat. The back side and front of the craft were angled. Much like the Chevron shape. It hovered motionlessly (except for slight jiggling up and down) over me for at least one minute.  Before it started off I could hear a slight air disturbance, and then it zigged slowly in a left angle about 50 - 75 ft. and stopped, then it zipped to a right angle and stopped, then left and stopped, then right and stopped in this exact pattern moving northwest acrossed Aurora towards the mountains until I could no longer see it.

Stingray like glide ghost.;2012-01-13 23:20:00;4 seconds;Stingray like glide ghost. On 1/13/2012 just about an hour ago from this post my mother and I saw a weird stingray but big, cloudy blueish object glide past her windshield of the vehicle.  My son and his friend were in backseat but dis not see anything.   I thought I was seeing things because I knew it was no bird, plastic bag or anything.  Temperture right now is 6 degrees no bird wld be flyimg in this. It came from the elementry schools direction NW and flew across with fluid ease & gone.   I said,  What was that?  My mother said, You saw it too, it looked like a stingray ghost!    We were in a residential area around the corner from the house so I IMMEDIATELY began to google and found this sight & hope to get answers.   Whatever it was seemed perfectfully harmless & seemed to fly across at the perfect moment to be seen.  I hope to find more people who have seen this.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Chevron-shaped object flyinf south over Aurora, Colorado.;2015-11-01 18:45:00;30 seconds;Chevron shaped object flyinf south over Aurora, Colorado. While standing in my backyard I was looking up in the sky and I saw a chevron shaped object with very dim light pattern on it ( seven total with thre on each side and one in the front ) flying at a low altitude from the north to the south.   It did not make any noise at all, but It was for real and could not believe what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he corrected the time to 1845 hrs. local time.

Chevron shape objects at night.;2019-04-15 20:44:00;10 seconds;Chevron shape objects at night While out in our hot tub, my wife and I were stargazing, when we saw a Chevron-shaped craft with dim lights on the bottom of the wings 4 on each side and 2 at the front of Chevron.  It was moving from west to east and was completely silent and was visible for 5-7 seconds and then disappeared into the night.  I reported the same sighting on this website in early November of 2015 also.  The craft was for real!  We scanned the sky for the next 15 minutes and also saw another Chevron shaped object that was white heading south to north and this one did not have any lights on the bottom of the wings.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
