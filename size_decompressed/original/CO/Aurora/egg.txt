UFO seen in backyard;2008-08-25 02:30:00;5 min.;UFO seen in backyard My oldest daughter, who lives about 4 miles away from me, called me around 7 a.m., the morning of August 25 or 26.  She said her daughter, 7 years old, woke up around 2 or 3 in the morning to use the bathroom.  When she returned to her room, she saw an object floating in the sky with red and blue lights.  She watched it fly around, get small in size, change its shape a few times and then finally fly away.  She then went to her mother's bedroom door and knocked on the door.  When her mother woke up and asked her what the problem was, the daughter told her mother what she had just seen.  The mother told her to go back to bed, that she must have been dreaming.  When my daughter told me, I asked if her daughter had been frightened by what she saw and she said she was a little scared but not overly frightened.  I then told her not to make a large fuss over the incident but maybe her daughter could draw a picture of what she had seen.  (Sending under separate cover).
