It had a foggy light dawning from it.  I nearly hit the curb staring at it.  from the short period I saw it, it was just hovering over what looked like Littleton or Highlands Ranch area.  I thought it was the moon at first, but after returning to see it again, nothing was there.  and few clouds were in that area at all.  I drove out towards cherry creak reservoir and had a clear view of a star lit sky, yet no moon or strange orange/yellow object.  from my perspective, it was about the size of a shot glass at my windshield (although clearly far away from me);39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068

The UFO seemed like a rocket about 6ft long or longer from my perspective. The object seemed to be arching toward Buckley AFB.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
