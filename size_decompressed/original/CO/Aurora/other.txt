Low, hovering object that appeared to be an airplane, but was too low and slow in the sky, then disappeared.;2004-03-17 18:00:00;2 minutes;Low, hovering object that appeared to be an airplane, but was too low and slow in the sky, then disappeared. My four daughters and I were traveling east on Alameda in our Suburban. In the distance we saw a strange airplane which appeared to be ascending from the ground where there is no airport, south to north. It turned and came straight toward us, traveling west on Alameda. It appeared to be an airplane, flying very slowly and low in the sky, but it stopped and hovered above and to the north of us. We saw other drivers watching, open mouthed at the same time. It seemed to just stop in the air, wasn't as high as it should have been for the size of the aircraft. It tilted on its left wing, then I drove past it as it was unusual and scared me, seemed it might crash. Looked in my rearview and the girls looked out the back window, but it was gone. Just disappeared. We couldn't see it anywhere behind or in front of us. It looked metallic, gray, kind of like a fighter airplane, but did not act or sound like one. I have no idea what it was.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Multiple (7-15) triangle shaped crafts with lights that would flash different colors;2015-07-16 02:30:00;3 hours;Multiple (7-15) triangle shaped crafts with lights that would flash different colors They started out as very shinny lights in the sky, me and a friend where on his balcony and noticed them.  When we took a closer look at them they seemed to look like they where growing and shrinking vertically, it was all different colors flashing mostly consisting of green, blue, white and red. They moved like they were flying in formation. One would move and then stop and it kept repeating itself until it eased its way across the sky.  Some of them would break formation suddenly and fly somewhere unrelated to its former path. They seemed to be right over Buckley Airforce Base.  Things got weird when two very silent jets took off from Buckley Airforce base and never came back from what we saw.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
I'm not even sure what really happened.  ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain this is intended as a serious report.  PD));2015-12-13 23:00:00;48:37 minutes;I'm not even sure what really happened We were just sitting and hanging out.  We had sneaked out that night and our parents didn't know about it.  We were just hanging out having a good time when suddenly we all couldn't move.  I could only move my eyes.  I looked around and everyone was completely still with their eyes moving from side to side.  Out of nowhere came a loud shrill sound from no where.  Our immobile mouths only made shrill cries from our throats.  It wouldn't stop. When it finally did and we could move again it was all still.  Then out of nowhere a large spot of light appeared in the sky.  It appeared almost like the sky was a rag soaking up the liquid-is state of the ship.  It shared no certain shape but it was so bright it burnt my eyes almost like staring at the sun, and that's all we could do was stare in ah  (sic.  awe).  Eventually a loud boom expelled from the light and then another and then another and we all scrambled for our cars.  The light followed us as we ran and even followed us till we were! suddenly all about 60 miles outside the city limits.  I was dropped off at home by my partner who i had spent the night with.  When i woke up this morning I found an extremely large bruise on the complete center of my chest.  My friends have also said they have also found large perfectly circular bruises on different parts of their body.  I'm extremely shaken up and needed to tell someone about these events.

Bright white shape seen close to a park.;2016-09-18 19:00:00;~1-2 minutes;Bright white shape seen close to a park. The object was bright white, almost as if it was glowing or shining. It was heading westward towards the setting sun. The best way I can describe it is a four pointed star with the top point chopped off.  I know this sounds weird, but I tried to take a picture and it would not show up on my camera.  I was using only an iPhone camera and it was very far away by that point, but it was still very strange. The object made no noise, however, there was an airplane nearby in the eastern hemisphere of the sky as I live very close to an airport.  The objects were not interacting, as far as I could see.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Single white crescent shaped light soundlessly moving 80 feet above me.;2017-08-14 21:00:00;5 seconds;Single white crescent shaped light soundlessly moving 80 feet above me I had gone out to the back yard with my dog and happened to look straight up.  I saw a crescent shaped light with a span of 5-6 feet, sharply defined against the dark cloudless sky approximately 80 feet above me.  It was moving from south to north in a straight line and made no sound.  Once I saw it and registered all of its detail, the light simply went out.   I continued to watch the spot where it had been but it did not reappear.  Once I was back inside, I wanted to check for any similar reports, but my internet was out.  Interestingly, the internet subscribers nearby were displayed and all of them had full range service.   My internet service came on 1/2 hour later.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
The lights always seem to make all the neighborhood dogs bark.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a planet??  PD));2017-12-22 01:00:00;Several hours;The lights always seem to make all the neighborhood dogs bark. Also when the lights appear I get a massive headache and feel nauseous. I WAS WOKEN UP BY MY DOGS AND OPENED THE CURTAINS TO MY ROOM WIDE OPEN. IT WAS CLEAR SKIES AND THE MOON WAS BRIGHT,  I HAPPENED TO LOOK SOUTH EAST OF MY WINDOW AND TWO lighted OBJECTS MOVING UP AND DOWN AND SIDE WAYS.  I THOUGHT MY EYES WERE PLAYING TRICKS ON ME, SO I put my glasses on to take a better look and it was still moving around.  The left one was moving more then the right one.  I felt that I must be crazy, so I woke my boyfriend up and told him to look up towards the SE skies and he was looking at the the lights moving oddly as well.  He went back to sleep because he does not like to be woken up like that, but I kept looking at the lights until I fell asleep.   This has not been the first time I have seen lights move around like that.  About 2 years ago it happened similar like that but no one one believes me.  When this occurs I get a massive headache and feel nausea. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a planet??  PD));39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
