Object was moving;1997-12-14 20:30:00;5 Min;Summary : Object seen shooting across the sky at a very high rate of speed and the stopped and started blinking a white light.  Object was moving faster than any shooting star. The object was seen moving from the NNW at about 50 Deg. to the NW at about 35 Deg. at an incredible rate of speed.  The object then stopped immediately and began blinking a white light that did not move.  The object witnessed appeared to be a a distance of at least 50 miles.  Took this report on 12/15/97 from the witness who has been credible in the past.  The witness does not want to release her name.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068

I was perticularly focused on the big dipper when I noticed the top star (on the right) started moveing. It moved in a straight pattern to the right. It moved very slowly as though it was a very high flying plane but it couldn't be because it was just to high up. I have perfect vision and I know what I saw. After about 4 to 5 seconds it vanished. After it vanished I couldn't see the star that was supposed to be there. It struck me as being very unusual but I wrote it off to maybe I was seeing things. It started to bother me after a while and caused me to reflect on myself. After a long time I deceided that I am not crazy , I don't see things that are not there and what I saw was true.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
while driving to wal-mart notice a reflection of something silvery high in the sky was to high up to notice shape or size but notice it;1998-11-03 14:30:00;5 min;while driving to wal-mart notice a reflection of something silvery high in the sky was to high up to notice shape or size but notice it didn't move like an airplane. I was on my way to do some shopping at wal-mart when I notice something very high and near the mountains, It was to high to see any detail it was only the sun reflecting of the surface that I notice. I tried to keep watch the object and drive which isn't easy. I notice an airplane that was heading towards the mountains and you could tell it was an airplane because of the white trail it left. the UFO had to be at the same altitude. Once the airliner got to close the object made a sharpe 45º turn toward the south then after a few seconds I lost sight of it. My back ground is I am 34 years old, I have a degree in Visual Communications and currently in school studing computer networking. I usually don't see strange objects in the sky. I don't know if this sighting will be helpful to your oganization but I felt like I had to tell someone. Thank you for listing.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Two fairly bright white lights moving in tandem.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness addendum states that object was not Space Station.  PD));2007-06-19 22:00:00;4 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  ISS orbiting with Space Shuttle?  PD)) 0n 06-19-07 at approximately 10:00 PM I observed the strangest thing I had ever seen. Two fairly bright white lights moving in tandem in the northern sky above Denver Colorado. The two lights were the size and intensity of the bright star Sirius. The night was beautiful and clear, the moon was hanging large and low on the horizon. These objects or object turned southeast and flew directly over my house and then suddenly vanished.  I was standing at my open rear door of my house when the sound of an approaching helicopter caught my attention, As usual with any low flying aircraft, I would go outside to watch for it. As soon as I stepped out onto my rear deck my attention was diverted to two bright lights approaching from the north. At first I thought the lights were stars and stationary, but then I soon realized they were moving in my direction. They were moving slowly in tandem as if two planes were flying in formation, one in front of the other. This struck me as very odd so I continued to watch them. The two lights were approaching me from a slight angle and they never once deviated laterally from their position. They continued heading in my direction. I stood there trying to understand what it was that I was looking at. As it over flew my house, I ran through the house and called for my teenage son to come to the front door to observe this as well. The two of us stood watching this thing cruise overhead silently and almost effortlessly. We both stood motionless trying to understand what it was we were watching. Within a few seconds the two lights flashed off in unison and it was all over.  The object appeared to be close however, it had no discernable shape. The object made absolutely no sound. The space and distance between the two lights can be measured by extending one full arm length and turning your hand at a 90 degree angle. one hand length. The area in which this thing traveled penetrated heavily regulated airspace, (class Bravo airspace) for DIA. This portion of class B airspace has a floor of 8000 feet MSL and a ceiling of 14,500 MSL. The object was in this air space and had also flown in between Centennial (KAPA) and Buckley AFB airspace. All three are manned by radar.  I am an instrument rated Private Pilot and I think I have a pretty good understanding of what airplanes look and sound like. This was no airplane, as this object had none of the required position lights / navigation lights or strobes that one would recognize as local aviation. The object was not a small dimly lit fast moving satellite, nor was it a commonly observed meteor streaking across our celestial heavenly body, and no, it was no weather balloon. I don’t know what this thing was that my son and I observed, but it left a bad taste in our mouths. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  ISS orbiting with Space Shuttle.  PD)) ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS: Two fairly bright white lights moving in tandem. ((NUFORC Note: ISS orbiting with Space Shuttle? PD))  First of all, the ISS orbiting with Space Shuttle occured the the next day.  My son and I observed that as well.  What we witnessed  on 6/19/07 at 2200 Hrs was Absolutely NOT the ISS/Space shuttle.  NOT EVEN CLOSE!;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068

My friend and I were at 225 and I70 near Fitzsimons.;2007-11-29 12:34:00;1 or 2 minutes;0n Thursday the 29th of November 2007 between 12:34 to 12:37 pm.  My friend and I were at 225 and I70 near Fitzsimons.  We were heading north towards I70 when I noticed an object in the sky on the right hand side it was shimmering rather brightly, it was sparkling.  I noticed it seem metallic, also appearing to be upright in the sky, that is straight up and down position.  I only saw this for a split second, at a time, due to me driving and I didn’t want an accident.  So I told my friend about the object hoping he could see it in better detail.  I told him I have binoculars by you.  The distance I really couldn’t tell you except that it seemed about ½ the distance of altitude that jets would fly. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report is well known to us, and we deem her to be a quite reliable witness.  PD));39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Three separate craft 2 moving north to south one moving south to north over Aurora,CO;2009-07-16 22:16:00;5 minutes;Three separate craft 2 moving north to south one moving south to north over Aurora,CO I saw what appeared to be a UFO. I stuck my head inside and yelled for my husband. By the time he got out and I turned around it was gone however we saw another one that clearly was not a plane(no running lights). It was moving north to south as was the first one I saw. It got brighter(very very bright) then it got smaller and dim before disappearing. It appeared to accelerate very quickly before it moved out of sight.  I was joking to my husband and said (Well guys is that all no more?) Then another appeared moving from the south to the north and again too far away to see the shape but close enough to see that it was not a plane ( no running lights) It moved up and one could clearly see it was accelerating before it disappeared out of sight.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068

4 objects moving and dancing at very high altitude. shiney, reflective orbs;2012-10-21 15:00:00;7-10 minutes;4 objects moving and dancing at very high altitude. shiney, reflective orbes Noticed up to 4 reflections of light at an extremely high altitude, flying around each other, would appear and disappear into the atmosphere.  Traveled across sky at high rate of speed, then would disappear again and reappear in their previous position within seconds.  Sky was clear, no cloud cover, to high for planes or birds, moved to fast for satellite, which don't fly and dance around in sky as these did.   Although no cloud cover the atmosphere appeared to separate around the objects.  The sky wad a slight shade darker blue around them.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
