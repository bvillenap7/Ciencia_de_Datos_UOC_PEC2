i could see it but my friend standing next to me could not it was plain as day right there.;1977-11-20 19:00:00;15 min;i could see it but my friend standing next to me could not it was plain as day right there. the shape of what I saw was circular but like a hockey puck it had round lights around the outside of the round part, the lights were white the light traveled one light at at a time around the round part of the object . the light seemed to skip to the next bulb shutting off the previous bulb as it traveled around and around the outside.this object was not far away at all if it were a plane or hellocopter i would have been able to hear it clearly but there was no sound at all. it moved very slowly and stopped at least once it sharply changed direction at least twice i watched it travel across denver to they edge of the front range then it took off at an angle into the sky like a flash and disappeared. but there is more that happened while it was above. i ran across the street to my friends house. i got him to come and see it i pointed directly at it, it was right there still but he could not see it at all this was very confusing at the time i was ten or eleven years old no one would believe me. also when it stopped for a second i felt like it had seen me watching it then it slowly started moving again.

4th of July 2013 at 9:40pm Aurora, Co. 3 orange circles  during firework seen by 4 people duration about 5 minutes;2013-07-04 21:40:00;3 minutes;4th of July 2013 at 9:40pm Aurora, Co. 3 orange circles  during firework seen by 4 people duration about 5 minutes 9:40pm 4th of July 2013 in Aurora, Colorado.  3 bright orange circled lights appeared in the denver sky, hovering over the city sky.  They were changing formation often.  First they would be in the formation of a triangle, then they would go into the formation of a straight line.  One time 2 of the objects would rotate around the third one.  Twice it appeared that they would all blend as one object for 2 seconds before breaking into 3 objects again.  There were 4 of us who witness this event and we can all see that there were some rotation within the object itself.  We were all so in awe with what we were seeing.  Anyhow, 2 of the objects disappear so quickly like a flash of light going 500 miles per hour type speed.  The third object hover for a few seconds longer and it just shot up into the air so fast it look like it evaporated.  Amazing, just amazing.  These objects were larger than a helicopter.  Believe me I was in the military for 5 years and I know ! what and how civilian and miliar choppers move and these objects were not either these objects were out of this world;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068

((HOAX??))  Large light, changing from green to red, moving erratically with great speed in western sky.;2016-05-28 22:25:00;10 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  When we first posted this report, we assumed that it was sincere, and submitted by a seriou-minded source.  However, that party has failed to respond to all our attempts to communicate with him, so we suspect that it may have been an attempt to hoax our Center.  We are uncertain.  PD)) Large light, changing from green to red, moving erratically with great speed in western sky. Directly due west of Aurora at 22:25, I witnessed what appeared to be a stationary red star, deep red in color with magnitude approximately 3 times that of Jupiter.  Position of red object was nearly 6 o'clock from Jupiter's position.   During observation, after approximately 3 minutes of observing while trying to determine what it was, I was seeing, object shifted to an emerald green color and began drifting - imagine a leaf falling to the ground.  This drift pattern of shifting left to right in gradually increasing arcs continued for approximately one minute before object became stationary again and began shifting back and forth from red to green.  Due to street light, I was unable to focus phone for photograph.  Object remained stationary for several minutes, changing in color with varying speeds from red to green before it moved incredibly fast across the sky due north. Three orb lights moving in different directions converged on the place where object was last stationary forming a very accurate triangle before blinking out.  They just vanished.  Object then raced back across sky for less than 10 seconds, changing colors from red to green while doing so before moving beyond my line of sight due west. As a photographer and amateur astronomer, I've seen meteorites, atmospheric impact on projected magnitude of various stars and planets and I am more than familiar with aircraft and helicopter appearance at night - this was absolutely not any of these things.  I can't tell you what it was that I saw, but I can tell you what it was not and it was not any standard astronomical object or known terrestrial craft. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068

Silver object in the sky moving slowly west to east then fast to north.;2018-05-31 10:00:00;15 minutes;Silver object in the sky moving slowly west to east then fast to north. Silver colored  ball in the sky moving from west to east very slowly.  Once it got near Buckley Air Force Base it turned 90 degrees to the north then sped up dramatically and continued to the north out of sight. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) The object was star like in shape. Also, I work for ((deleted)) and I don’t want to expose myself to too much media attention.  But I did want to report the sighting to you.  If you do happen to talk about the report, just don’t use my name.  Thanks. ((END ADDENDUM));39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
