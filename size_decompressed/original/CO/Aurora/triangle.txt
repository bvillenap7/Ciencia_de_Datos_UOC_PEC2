Triangle shaped object traveling slowly over Colorado neighborhood;1998-11-20 20:00:00;5-10 minutes;Triangle shaped object traveling slowly over Colorado neighborhood Some friends and I were snowboarding in the back yard of my neighbors house in the winter and were building a jump off a terraced lawn.  The youngest of us, who then was probably 9 or 10 years of age told us to look at the object flying in the sky.  We told him it was just a plane that was flying low over the neighborhood.  As it got closer we realized he wasn't lying and what he saw wasn't a plane but a triangle shaped object that had no sound to it, or very little because no one paid attention to the sound.  The object looked like a triangle but had smooth corners like that of a thick dorito chip.  We all stood there for a couple minutes staring at the object and it continued to move over our houses.  The object was flying much lower than any plane and had three or four main lights with smaller symmetrical lights between the main ones.  The lighting was not any different color than that of a normal halogen lightbulb, although it was much larger.  I haven't seen one since and none of us have talked about it because we lost touch.  The neighbors I saw it with were all part of the same household and I myself lived next door.  They ended up returning to their hometown in Canada, which is why we haven't talked since.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Triangular craft (two footbal fields in size);2000-10-26 22:00:00;10 Minutes;Triangular craft (two footbal fields in size) As reported to Art Bell in October 2000, I was fortunate enough to see a Triangular UFO from my home deck in Aurora, CO.  I was out on the deck of my house about 10:00PM looking with binoculars looking out at the city and stars. A huge triangular object at least two football fields in size suddenly appeared from the south above my house.  It was coming from the south direction near NORAD in Colo. Spgs.  It was Triangular in shape, and definitely had cloaking or stealth capability.  It was travelling at a slow rate of speed over my house, and following the I225 corridore parallel to Buckley AFB.  The whole interior of the craft was lighted when decloaked and I could see inside the craft as it passed me.  It had huge rectangular wing spars which may have been power sources or generators.  The control center at the front of the craft was all lighted.  As it was parallel to Buckley AFB (classified-Radar Domes)it started to cloak or go into a stealth mode and as it proceeded North and disappeared.  The amazing part, is Denver International Airport to the north uses this area as a holding pattern for commercial jets landing but, it did not seam to interfere with the Triangular UFO as it slowly moved along the interstate.  I am now retired, and worked for many years as a missile launch technician for the Defense Dept., and as a Quality Manager for McDonnell Douglas building pilot training programs and software, Telecommunications etc.  I am now a firm believer in UFO's, and no debunking by the government or military will ever change my mind.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Several objects came from big one, then I lost sight of them...;2002-08-03 13:45:00;1-3 minutes;Several objects came from big one, then I lost sight of them... I saw a very large triangle shaped object out my window while ((outside)).  I'm not sure how large, or how far away it was, but I could tell it was moving very slowly.  It seemed to slow down, and stop. then several more, smaller objects seemed to come out of it.  The were circular shaped, and were also moving very slowly.  They all went different directions, and then the bigger one picked up speed (note that it never got smaller, so I could tell that the others came OUT of it), and went the other direction (started going west, then went east).  The others also picked up speed.  I realized that I was peeing all over the floor, and looked down very briefly (about a second, maybe two), and they were gone.  I don't know if there were any other witnesses.  I didn't tell anyone before this, because I have a reputation to uphold, and most of my friends would think I went insane... There didn't seem to be any lights or sounds, but there may have been.  I think it was pretty far away, and it was daytime.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
3 triangle craft,  2 red and one yellow/amber;2008-12-29 22:45:00;3 minutes;3 triangle craft,  2 red and one yellow/amber Strange orange light appeared against the stars in the north east. Seeing that this was a bit strange, I went to get my binoculars after a few minutes of observing this strange light. After retrieving my binoculars, it came closer at a high rate of speed.  As it turned to go west I observed what was orange, now become 2 red objects and one yellow/amber object. The light from all 3 objects did not strobe and the lights appeared as orb/arrowhead shapes in single file one behind the other with two red and one the amber object trailing. As the craft came closer these craft were of triangle shape and all were of equal distance,  but then converged into a triangular formation. The amber was at it's highest point in the triangle formation, and as the objects traveled through the sky, the formation changed to a single file formation and then back to a triangle formation with the amber object now at the bottom of the formation. There was no sound from these craft and there were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.  The speed was enormous for the distance I observed. The objects were about 32-36 thousand feet (perhaps less), descending quickly and were about 3 to 4 miles away. I was able to observe the object for about 6-7 seconds going west. I have a nearly unobstructed 180 degree panoramic view from the back of my house  which points almost directly north. I live in an area that has a lot of airplane traffic, so I know these were not planes. However, soon after, there was a plane that flew over my house and then abruptly changed direction,  the same direction that these craft were headed. My background- I have served in the Air Force for 12 years, and held a Top Secret/SCI clearance and have worked around aircraft during my time in and I was also stationed At Cheyenne Mountain/NORAD for 8 years. I would have sent this in sooner, but I wanted to make a better drawing to send in so I could show the time line and events;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068

5-7 white triangles observed flying in formation.;2016-03-29 15:30:00;20-30 seconds;5 to 7 white triangles observed flying in formation. The day was a typical post blizzard, beautiful clear, Colorado day.  I had just pulled into the driveway of my parents' home to visit.  I heard the engines of fighter jets above which drew my attention to the sky.  Now jets overhead is a daily occurrence with Buckley Air Force Base minutes away.  I have become a custom to seeing things in the sky having grown up in Aurora, by the AFB.   At the age of 42, I have come to relize that as young teenager along with a neighbor friend, we witnessed a black triangle almost some 30 years ago.  I digress, back to the recent sighting.   As I was looking for the jets, I noticed a formation of about 5 to 7 white triangles moving south to north over the AFB, but at very high altitude.  To me it did not seem as though the jets were after these objects, but obviously I do not know that for sure.   I observed these triangles for about 20 to 30 seconds as they moved across the sky in formation.  In my mind, I can rule out geese or seagulls as, these objects moved in a tight formation.  One triangle that was on the left of the formation did break from the rest, drop to the rear only to rejoin the formation again on the right side.  It was not long after that I lost sight of the objects.  Again, I know what birds in flock look like and this was not that.
