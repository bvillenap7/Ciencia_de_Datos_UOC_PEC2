6 crescent shapes in the sky southeast of denver;2001-10-15 17:30:00;3-5min;6 crescent shapes in the sky southeast of denver on the way home from my job myself and two friends were driving southeast on interstate 225 along side of the Cherry Creek Dam. just as we rounded the turn and could see the open sky in front of us i noticed what looked like about 6 very large white crescent shapes in the sky.  they were not moving at all but the phenomenon lasted a few minutes, the distance that we were away from them it looked as though they could have benn as tall as a five story building and spaced the same distance between eachother.  as we drove towards the shapes more the crescent on the far righthand side began to shift and appeared to dissolve a little at the bottom and just a quickly as they had appeared they just vanished.

Group of faint red lights flying in a boomerang formation very high and quiet;2001-11-18 04:30:00;2 minutes;Group of faint red lights flying in a boomerang formation very high and quiet While looking at the Leonid meteor shower, I noticed a satellite traversing the sky directly overhead, that satellite was moving in a NNE direction. While looking at the satellite I saw a group of faint red lights moving in a boomerang formation from North to South that intersected the satellite path. The red lights clearly passed in front of the satellite. I did not file this report until I reasoned everything I saw that night and I went to the Satellite Prediction Report that I recieved from http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/RealTime/JPass/PassGenerator/....the satellite I may have seen was proabably ALOUETTE 1 or RadarSat......but I know for sure that the red lights I saw were not a plane or satellite. I asked my next door neighbor who was outside also with his Celestron telescope 'did you see that' and he said 'yes I see it too...your are not crazy'.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
White dots over Aurora.;2014-07-04 22:30:00;10 minutes;white dots over aurora. I seen 3 bright lights in formation of a triangle slowly hovering. I was looking toward the sky watching fireworks while walking when all the sudden down the path I was walking.   I seen these 3 bright white lights not flashing just hovering for a approximately 3 minutes.  Then like Christmas lights they disappeared then randomly changing formation.  Then a few minutes later they follows in a line of 8 lights that appeared head west one synchronized in flight pattern looked the shape of an upside down hook in the sky.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Broad daylight, blue sky, 7 silvery things that looked like they were trying to form a circle.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-28 11:00:00;<1 minute;Broad daylight, blue sky, 7 silvery things that looked like they were trying to form a circle. Broad daylight, looked up at the clear blue sky and saw this cluster of 7 silvery, shiny like misshapen circles that had a thin dark border around each one.  These 7 circles were in kind of a messed up connected circle, with one of them seeming to be lagging behind.  They would be there one second and - poof! - would just totally be gone.  In a second or two, you could see them again.   When they would come back into view the big circle of them together would be a little more of an actual circle.  The lagging one seemed to finally catch up with the rest and they were shiny silver, and when the lagger was almost in place the whole thing just disappeared totally and we didn't see it again, watched for a long time and it never reappeared.   It was totally silent, was going North to South, seemed to be moving smoothly although in a disorganized circle at first.  It was at a higher elevation than the airplanes that we always see coming and going from the airport.   It left us just stupefied, and asking each other over and over, Did you SEE that?

Objects were flying in a straight line in the distance, disappearing above one by one;2020-01-14 19:00:00;5 minutes;Objects were flying in a straight line in the distance, disappearing above one by one Objects looking like stars were flying in a straight line in the distance.  They all traveled the same speed with the same distance to each other and getting a little brighter at first when they getting closer, disappearing above one by one by one.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
3 objects in a triangle formation;2021-01-31 11:00:00;5 minutes;3 objects in a triangle formation I was driving south on I-225 around the 6th Ave exit around 11-11:30 am on Sunday 1/31/21.  When I looked to my left and noticed 3 objects flying in a triangle formation.  They were moving very slow and had a very strange contrail that moved around them almost like it would be a high speed re-entry type.  This was not like a normal aircraft where the contrail comes out of the back of the engine on each wing or the tail of the aircraft.  I watch it for at least 5 minutes until I drove past it, if I was not driving I could have watched it for a lot longer.  I am an A&P mechanic that works for a major airline and the reason I am reporting this, is because this was 100% not normal.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
