green meteor;2004-07-07 01:45:00;10 seconds;green meteor Some friends and I were watching a movie in our living room when my one friend shouted out oh my god what is that?  My other friend and I looked out the window to see a huge brite green like streak accross the sky, it almost resembled a meteor.  It only lasted a few seconds but we all got a really good look of the object. It was going from West to East, and was in sight for a maximum of 10 seconds, and then dissapeared over the horizon.  The event occured at approximately 1:45am MDT over Aurora, Colorado. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Amber Orb hovering over the skies in Aurora Colorado.;2014-03-19 00:40:00;10 minutes;Amber Orb hovering over the skies in Aurora Colorado. While driving home, I saw a bright amber light hovering very high in the southern sky behind some houses.  It must have been a few miles away.  The strange thing was that the object wasn't moving across the sky (like a plane would), but seemed to be fixed.  I could tell it wasn't a star because of the way it kind of morphed, going from solid to fireball shape, and because of the color being solid amber/white.   Luckily I had my camera with me and filmed the event. The entire object, not just part of it, flashed a few times.  At one point, I reached down to look at my cell phone to check the time, and when I looked back, the object was gone.  I drove around the neighborhood trying to find it again, but it was gone. Here is a link to the video I uploaded on youtube:  http://youtu.be/FCA95u123XE;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
5 Bright lights seen.;2014-06-05 22:30:00;15 minutes;5 Bright lights seen. 5 bright lights were seen heading west all within a few minutes of each other.  Images would not show up on camera for some reason.  Thought they were meteors, but no news on them, and have never seen planes go that way. ((NUFORC Note:  A second telephoned report from other witnesses in Aurora, CO, was received on the morning of Friday, June 6th.  It appears that both groups witnessed the same cluster of objects.  We are awaiting those other reports from the second set of witnesses, as we post the database on June 6th, 2014.  PD));39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Six orange crafts flew over our house late Friday night, one at a time.;2015-05-30 22:30:00;12 minutes;Six orange crafts flew over our house late Friday night, one at a time. On May 30, 2015, two of my daughters, myself, and their dad saw 6 orange crafts fly directly over our house.  One at a time.  They were so bright they looked like fireballs.   We took photos using our cell phones and I had a camera in the car out front, too, so I got some shaky shots with that as well.   They came from south to north approximately 2-4 minutes apart..making no sound at all. They also appeared to be flying lower than a plane would.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068

I was outside in the driveway smoking a cigarette and I seen the diamond shaped fireball come straight up  from behind the neighbors houses in the distance from the northeast and it moved sideways to the south towards parker very fast and it looked like it was lowering as it started to get out of my sight because  I could  not see it over the houses at the end of the block anymore it was more orange then red and it had a sparkle like dot at the tip of the bottom it scared me so I tossed my cigarette and went in the house it change my whole outlook on ufo's or other life forms I have never seen anything move horizontally or diagnally that smooth and fast with no sound coming from it!;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068

I was fishing on the South side of Cherry Creek State Park and there was very little illumination for lights, it was dark and excellent;2019-09-01 23:00:00;3 minutes;I was fishing on the South side of Cherry Creek State Park and there was very little illumination for lights, it was dark and excellent for viewing stars in the night sky.   I was looking up at the sky and thought I seen a red dwarf star, then I realized it was moving North at a very high rate of speed.  In a matter of seconds it was ok I sight.   Maybe a minute later I seen another round orange object move over head at the same rate of speed, almost the same trajectory, then a moment later a third object followed the previous two.  They maintained a straight flight path and was very high overhead one second and out of sight a few seconds later.  Awesome experience!;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
