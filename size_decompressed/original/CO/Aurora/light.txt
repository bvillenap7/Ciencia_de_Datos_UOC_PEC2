While star-gazing, I saw what I thought to be a satellite moving overhead. Same intensity of light and speed as other satellites I've seen, but after watching it for about three seconds, it zig-zagged back and forth about four times (very rapidly) before disappearing.

Four unusual lights flying over Colorado Skies;2001-01-13 19:15:00;18 minutes;Four unusual lights flying over Colorado Skies When my husband went to smoke a cigarrette outside,he called me and took me to the little park we have behind the house, that has no trees and is an open space. He pointed straight up to the clean and clear sky without clouds and we both saw a very bright light moving in small circles, then the light took a 180 degree turn and flew straight away to the east with a speed faster than a jet. No noises were heard. After a few minutes we saw what it was like two lights going north without noises apparently at a very high altitude with a very high speed too, one of the lights made a sudden turn approximately 120 degrees angle going also to the east and desappeared soon after, while the other light went straight north desappearing too. The last light appeared from the west going east at the same  high speed and suddenly claimed into the space desappearing.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Blinking white light moving unnaturally;2001-11-18 00:30:00;5 minutes;Blinking white light moving unnaturally Myself, my wife, and a good friend of ours drove out as far east as we could get on Smoky Hill Road to escape the light pollution of the city to watch the Leonoid meteor shower.  As we arrived, the sky was a mostly cloudy but we hoped it would clear.  It was very cold (mid 30's Fareheit) outside.  As we sat in the car, we were facing directly east.  As we were looking for meteors, my wife commented that all she saw was an airplane or something just above the horizon, due east of us.  When she mentioned it, we started observing it also. It was too far away from us to make out any details of a craft.  I can only guess, but I'd say it was ~5 miles away from us.  It was a white light, looked about the intensity of landing lights on a commercial airliner.  It was blinking very rapidly with a very consistent strobe-like rhythm.  The strobe frequency seemed almost like an everyday jetliner, however it lacked the tell-tale red nav light on the top. Since we couldn't see any meteors due to the clouds, we watched it for a bit.  The light moved a bit from the north to the south (approximately 3-4 degrees) and maintained what appeared to be a very low altitude.  I guessed it might be a car driving up a road and the headlights appearing to pulsate due to roadside trees crossing their path.  Just as I said this, the light jumped straight up ~10 degrees above the horizon.  The movement was deliberate and VERY swift. This was certainly not a car and no aircraft that I've ever seen could have ascended this quickly.  It moved an apparent 5 degrees in much less than a second. We were somewhat surprised at this movement, but as we are all fairly skeptical and scientific minds, we again guessed this must have been some sort of aircraft.  As we watched it began to move south, but as it moved, it bounced up and down very, very quickly.  Again, I can't stress enough that common airplanes or helicopters do not move this fast or in this fashion.  As it headed south it slowed dramatically and then headed north again, it appeared not to even stop when changing direction.  It accellerated just as quickly as it decellerated after reversing direction. This change of direction was simply amazing.  It seemed to have the dexterity of a small insect.  It moved up and down and north to south for several minutes as we watched in awe, all the time trying to understand what the heck we were watching.  I suppose the natural thing to do is to try and explain it away, but there was nothing that we could think of that could maneuver like this. After a few minutes of this, it travelled deliberately south/southwest of us and passed behind a hill that obscured our vision.  The other side of the hill that we could see was the town of Parker, which had many lights of its own and made it difficult to track.  We saw many lights that seemed to match this one, but couldn't be sure as they didn't appear to move. We stayed for three hours at that location and eventually saw the meteors.  The light we were watching was very clearly *not* a meteor.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068

Flashing light Ascends quickly in the night sky;2005-08-16 22:10:00;10 seconds;Flashing light Ascends quickly in the night sky While sitting in my hot tub in my back yard (as I do every night) I observed 2 aircraft overhead in the normal flight patterns over our house (approximately 2000 feet or lower for both aircraft - they appeared to be in a landing pattern for DIA).  After watching these aircraft move off to the north and the east respectively, I turned my focus up to the stars directly above the backyard.  I saw a bright flash (as bright as the surrounding stars) which I assumed was one of the many aircraft which fly at high altitude which I have seen many times.  The flash appeared in the center of a triangle of stars directly above me. This flash was brighter than normal, and caught my attention.  I continued to watch the point in space, looking to see which direction the aircraft was headed.  A second flash, not as bright, appeared in the same position as the first - in the center of the three stars.  It was approximately 2 seconds after the first.  2 Seconds later, another flash in the same position, only smaller and not as bright.  At this point I could assume that the source of the flash was climbing straight up based on it's position in relation to the 3 star triangle. Additionally, each flash had gotten dimmer, and smaller.  A final 4th flash came as a barely viewable blip of light - once again in the center of the triangle of stars.  Watching the sky for 10 minutes did not produce any other flashes or sources of the light.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
An aircraft that is so close and no noise?;2006-01-08 06:05:00;30 seconds;An aircraft that is so close and no noise? As I was heading South on this particular road, I noticed in the sky four lights, horizontally arranged. I got closer and had to stop at the intersection light, I noticed that this object was no more than a few hundred feet in the air. I found it odd that any aircraft I have noticed in the air before was considerably higher( enless near an airport)and made some type of noise. Neither one was the case. It seemed to remain in one particular area for about 5-10 seconds. The object then took about a 45 degree turn to fly directly above my vehicle and appeared to disappear soon after that. I completely questioned myself about this, it was unbelievable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
Apparent bright sundog, brilliant aqua green, yellow and pale orange;2006-01-21 16:15:00;10 minutes;Apparent bright sundog, brilliant aqua green, yellow and pale orange A brilliant apparent sundog in the southwest sky.  The sun was about 5 to 10 degrees obove the horizon, as viewed from Aurora in late afternoon.  A very bright rainbow type light illuminated a short hanging curtain cloud to the left of the soon to be setting sun. The light was a brilliant aqua green that shifted to yellow then a pale orange as if you were looking at a short section of a rainbow.  I am sure this was a form of sundog, however I noted that the flat luminous cloud reflecting the sun, sort of like a shimmering curtain of a cloud  was totally unlike the other clouds in the sky, which were mostly small round puffs covering most, but not all of the sky.  It was only after I had watched the sundog, and it was starting to weaken, that I noted the short curtain cloud causing this effect was directly under what I would call a dark, cigarette shaped cloud from which the curtain cloud descended.  I would not call the dark cloud a cigar shape, but more of a thin, long cigarette.  There were no similar cloud formations in the sky. But there were other apparently higher clouds farther west and thus that might account for the cigarette cloud being darker, as it was in the shadow of other clouds between it and the sun. But again, the sun dog seemed limited to just his halo or hanging curtain of mousture.  It might have been verdigri extending down from this long, thin cloud, but normally that is in very long strings whereas this was shorter and more compact.  But the cloud causing the sundog was like a mist cloud, perhaps an effect of the angle of the sunlight.  I am fairly certain this was a form of sundog, with the cloud particles in just the right spot to bend and refract the sunlight in my direction. (I was in the south parking lot of Aurora Mall on Alameda Avenue.)  I am not posting this as a ufo or unidentified object, but wish to post it in reference to the contrasting long thin cloud above the sundog in case anyone else had a differing view of this event that would indicate something else.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
2 balls of light chasing each other at high rate of speed;2007-01-25 15:30:00;30 sec.;2 balls of light chasing each other at high rate of speed I am an avid CB radio operator and I like to go out to the car and talk on the radio.  On the night of the 25th of January, 2007, I walked out to my truck and noticed two balls of light in the sky chasing each other.  I didn't think much of it at first, I figured it was probably some type of spotlight.  I got in my truck and turned on the radio, and there was incredible interference, registering +50 db on my meter.   I got out of the truck to check the antenna connection and noticed the balls had come much closer, and had become much brighter.   I watched these lights chase each other for at least 30 seconds, until they both sped toward the horizon at an unimaginable rate of speed.   I got back in my truck and the interference was gone, and I could hear several stations on the air.  I asked one of them, a friend of mine, how long he had been on the air he told me he had been talking on that channel since 13:00.

The first night was last night, with my friend he was doing astrophotography and noticed what we thought to be a planet, until it shot to the right quickly.  It appeared to be a bright orange-ish light.  Just a big, abnormally bright, amber-orange ball of light.  It moved like a jellyfish kind of it would dart left, then float back right a little, and dart left again, but it would change directions quickly.  From what we saw, there was no distinct pattern in the flight.  I did manage to capture some video. Then, tonight (7/21), we were outside smoking, and look up to see the same amber colored ball outside, same movement type.
