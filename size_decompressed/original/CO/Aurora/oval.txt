Brillant oblong object spotted over Aurora, CO.;2009-09-16 13:20:00;15 seconds;Brillant oblong object spotted over Aurora, CO. It was a clear, Sunday afternoon.  No clouds.  I was sitting in the kitchen have lunch. My sliding glass window faces my backyard.  My backyard backs up to a park. I live in a new development. The trees are young, not very big. At approximately 13:20 hours (or 1:20 ish) I saw a oblong/oval brillant object in the sky. It appeard like it was floating. There was no noise. It was the brightest and most unusual object I have ever seen. I live very close to Buckley Airforce base. I am very familar with the jets/planes that fly around as well as the very loud noise they make.  The object was not very big, although it was hard to gage the distance.  It probably was the size of an F14 - just oval and made of light. It was sun brillant.  I could make out by the shadows that it appared to have two decks. I watched as it moved behind a small tree.  I waited to it see appear on the other side, never looking away, but it never reappeared on the other side of the tree. I w! ent outside to look in all directions and it just vanished.  About 7 to 10 minutes later, I saw a jet (white and red not grey like all the other jets I've seen) take off in a southeast direction. Just one jet, no others followed.  I know what I saw was real.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
UFO spotted in SE skies this past summer.;2012-07-14 21:00:00;<5 minutes;UFO spotted in SE skies this past summer. We were watching a movie in the backyard at night when one of our guests told us all to look at the sky.  It had a light blue light and was about the size of a pea from where we were sitting.  It was stationary for a second or two and then moved in zigzag directions before it descended out of our site. We thought for sure it was a UFO and called Buckley Air Force Base.  The gentleman that answered the phone stated he did not hear of anything and responded to us as if we were crazy for asking. We knew it was not a plane, jet, or helicopter and before this day I was skeptic of so called UFO sightings. I am not for sure of the date this happened but it was in the summer of this year and was approximately 3 nights prior to the news story of the pilot who called his air traffic control people to state he just witnessed a UFO in flight. I had never heard of this site before until I just read the news story from November 8th, of the UFO sighting in Denver.  Now it really has me curious as to what we saw.  The object was in the South-West sky.  The observers of this UFO were 4 families, including 4 children (ages 5 years old) who were also excited about seeing the object, asking what it was they had just witnessed.
