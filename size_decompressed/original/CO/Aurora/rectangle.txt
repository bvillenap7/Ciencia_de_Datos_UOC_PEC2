large very black object;2003-04-20 13:45:00;30 seconds;While I was driving on interstate 270, right at the intersection of 25 and 270, I saw in the distance a large very black object that looked square. Its location seemed to be some distance east of the intersection of parker and 270 ( 5 miles away). It rotated as I looked at it and seemed to have a brown edge to it. I went under a bridge and then looked again and there was a small cloud where to object was(?). Then about a minute later I saw 2 f-16s taking off from Buckely air base then turn and fly to the general vicinty of where the object was.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
20 red flashing lights in a rectangular formation, 60 degrees diagonal orientation in the sky, slowly moving & descending;2017-12-09 20:58:00;5 minutes;20 red flashing lights in a rectangular formation, 60 degrees diagonal orientation in the sky, slowly moving & descending I saw lots of red lights flashing in a sparkling manner, looking like a large glittering object in the sky.  It was exactly west of where I live in Aurora, over the city of Denver, CO.  It might have been far enough away to be right over the mountains.  I was in my backyard letting the dog out when I saw them.  I thought it was radio towers at first, but I never noticed them before.  They were also flashing much faster than the slow blink of radio towers.  Any given flash was instantly on and off rather than the gradual turning on and off that you would see from radio towers.  The light flashes seemed to be occurring randomly across a rectangular shaped area, about the length of 3 moon widths, and about 3/4 as wide as the moon would be in the sky.  There must have been at least 20 distinctly different lights flashing in rectangular formation. The rectangle of lights was diagonal in the sky, mostly vertical, perhaps about 60 degrees angle, with the highest point of the rectangle on my left (meaning that it more south).  Then I noticed the object was slowly moving to the left and downward, which means it was moving south and decreasing in altitude.  This happened very slowly, and it was similar to watching the sun set.  After 5 minutes, it had slowly disappeared because it went below my neighbor's house, so I couldn’t see it anymore.   I went for a walk 10 minutes later and didn’t see it anywhere on the horizon.  Whatever it was, it was gone.   I told my roommate about it, and his friend had just posted on facebook about seeing something that looked like a line of aircraft flying in the sky.;39.6695444272445;-104.803991486068
