Unbelievable speed, instantly move across sky.;2015-07-18 10:30:00;45 seconds;Unbelievable speed, instantly move across sky. Object about 3 miles high.  It instantly jerked across sky 20 miles or more. Jerked back to near same position.  Tried taking photos, it wouldn't let me focus on it, kept jerking away in short bursts.  I did find the image in two of my photos, blurry but you can make out the shape.  My wife found the images while zooming in on picture while I was in office drawing on paper what I saw.  When I showed her my drawing, it matched what she found in pictures.;40.3681;-103.9678
