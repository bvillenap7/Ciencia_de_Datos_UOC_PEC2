Conditions:  Night, partly clouded sky (Black Sky)   While standing on a porch I noticed a string of lights to the North.  The lights were in a tight row, coming off and on in white and blue colors.  From an arm’s length, the length of lights ranged from a half inch to two and a half inches in length.  They appeared at the same height (elevation) after going out and returning several times.  They were behind a tower and bracketed by tree branches.  Gauging their height, they appeared to be 25 to 30 feet off the ground.  They would come back each time in different intensities and colors of red or white. On or about their eighth or ninth return, they were mostly red, not as bright but one red light was ejected upward in an arch to the east. The lights seemed to hover and when bright, it appeared to have a mist around them and connected by a reflective surface.  Two prominent white lights most often appeared brightly when returning and the reflective surface was more enhanced in their glare. I returned this morning at 0700 hrs.  The next morning, I snapped pictures to better to define what was in this area to make up the tower. The lights, each time, would return in a different position and in different colors and numbers.  Sometimes their position was more to the right of the tower and sometimes more to the right, but always the same height. My wife was also present and saw this event I went into the building and came out an hour later and did not notice more lights. I’m still looking for other causes for this.  I’ll be out again tonight.;38.0474;-103.7218
