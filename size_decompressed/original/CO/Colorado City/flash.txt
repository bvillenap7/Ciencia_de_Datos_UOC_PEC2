Disappearing rockets.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-02 19:00:00;30 seconds;Disappearing rockets Driving home from pueblo I saw what appeared to be 3 rockets coming over the mountain and three more coming up on the side slightly behind them and then they vanished.  They looked like large fire work rockets gold in color.  I asked others if they saw on facebook and they also said they saw this.  One person described it before I even described.
