Stationary orange light in sky fades in and out;2021-01-28 18:00:00;5 seconds;Stationary orange light in sky fades in and out Leaving Colorado Springs heading south I observed an orange light fade in and then out, clearly above the mountains on the horizon but very far away. A green light followed it, just to its left in the sky. I thought nothing of it until I got home to Colorado City, where I and my partner observed the same color orange light fade in and out two times, not moving position in the sky. There was an aircraft somewhat low nearby which seemed to be making wade circles. I found one tweet from a trucker who seemed to have seen multiple of these lights from I-25 a week before we did.;37.9412;-104.838
