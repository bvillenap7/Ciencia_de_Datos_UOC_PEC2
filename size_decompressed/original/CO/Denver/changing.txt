(see discripton);2001-04-16 23:00:00;2 minuites aprox.;(see discripton) There were three of them.  They just came out of nowhere and just floated in the sky for a minuite or so.  At first they were of a saucer shape.  After about every 5 seconds they each changed their form in shape size and quanity.  What was espesially different about them is that their was a pattern to their changing quanity, some what of a fibbinocii sequence.  Their was one saucer shaped one and then their was 3 and they were all egg shaped.  The sequence kept going like this for 2 minuits approx.  The shapes consisted of mainley round objects.  Most of all them I cannot describe.  IT happened at 11 o'clock at night on April 16 2001.  Thats pretty much it.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

The objects were reflective and the movement was not wind driven and appeared in the field at once.;2005-10-24 17:20:00;25 minutes;The objects were reflective and the movement was not wind driven and appeared in the field at once. I was in downtown Denver and just happened to look up in the Northern sky at a jet coming over head.  The fall day was clear, no clouds in the sky, and the temperature was in the low 70’s.   The Sun was low in the western sky and blocked by high rise building.   The jet reflected the silver off the body of the aircraft.  I just happened to look off to the side and I noticed a small rice grain shaped object that was a reddish brown color, very subdued.   I watched it and at first I thought I was watching a very high flying bird or weather balloon.   I now saw another object that appeared to be about the same size.  I looked at my clock on the wall and it was 17:25 (5:25 PM MST).   I continued to watch for about 5 minutes as the two faint objects went around each other.  If I held out a silver dollar at arms length the two things would have circles that item.  At about 17:31 (5:31 PM MST) I noticed a very bright object appear.   Now that looked like a weather balloon, very bright, silver colored and the other two objects circled it.   One of the smaller object started to move southeast and a slow rate, about the speed of a satellite crossing the night sky.    The larger object and a smaller one stayed in the area of the northern sky, high angle to me.   I was under the impression that the objects were reflective and the light was reflected from the Sun and they were very high in altitude.  At this time a friend, lady was leaving the building and I showed her the two small objects and the larger one.   The objects were as follows.   The small one was traveling south east and I showed her.   The larger one was in the northern sky with one of the smaller one.   At this time another small object just appeared.  We both saw it and the lady stayed for a few minutes and watched but left to get a bus to go home.  It was 17:36 (5:36 PM MST.   A friend that worked with me came on station, (Court Security Officers) and I showed him the objects.    The first small one was moving slow and almost east of us and the larger one was moving in that direction.   I lost sight of  the two and as my friend and I watched, two more appeared, we looked at each other and I said, “God they look like weather balloons but they move as if powered.    The first small one was still moving southeast and went behind a building and we lost sight.  The bright, larger one was moving south east and as it was east of us just stopped.   At this time the two lost objects came from the north and passed by the larger one with in 30 seconds and were gone out of sight.    The large bright object appeared to have stopped and I I would not have seen what took place I would have thought that I was looking at Venus or Sirius at this time.  Several other people came by and we showed them the object, they saw it and thought it was a star or weather balloon.   One of the younger men stated that the bight object looked cylindrical in shape and was reflective.  That object stayed in the east and I had high rise buildings covering 75% of the sky.  I am ((deleted--sixties)), retired ((civil servant considerable responsibility, ((deleted--three decades)) years in the military, active and reserve, I have had a telescope sense 1957 and have seen everything in the sky that could be observed in that time.   I in my life can not explain this one.   I would have thought it to be a weather balloon at first but not the way it moved and stayed in position.  The reflective silver of the one object and the five others were a reflective redish brown color and fainter the large one.  When the large object just appeared with the two smaller ones I was floored, I can not explain that sighting.   I you need to contact me please do so.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Huge lighted cluster in the eastern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));2007-10-10 04:00:00;45 minutes+;Huge lighted cluster in the eastern sky Hello - about 4:15 am on 10/10/07, I noticed a relatively large and bright planet on the eastern horizon.  Because it seemed so unusually bright and huge to the naked eye, almost like a large cluster,  I got my binoculars and observed it from there for the next hour.  It appeared to change shape from that of a hexagon to a triangle to a longer sphere.  The outer edges were extremely bright with a huge cluster in the middle – almost like multiple points or dots of lights.  Sometimes, the shaped changed to a crescent form – like a ladies diamond necklace.  At all times, there appeared to be 8-10 larger lights with all of the remaining dot lights contained within the shape.  At times, the larger lights appeared to be connected with a chain of smaller lights.  It is now 5:15 am and with the naked eye, you can clearly see it is a huge cluster of something in the sky.

Viewed a silent, grey, shape shifting ufo fly over the nearby Denver Pepsi Center at 9:36pm.;2007-10-25 19:36:00;2-3 minutes;Viewed a silent, grey, shape shifting ufo fly over the nearby Denver Pepsi Center at 9:36pm. My room mate and I were walking from Capital Hill to the Starz Theatre, next to the Denver Pepsi Center to see an advance screening of Lions for Lambs.  We are about 5 minutes from the theater when I first noticed  a strange looking object flying overhead.  It was around 9:36pm and the sky was getting dark enough to see the FAA lights on the aircraft, but still bright enough to make out the shape of nearby helicopters and airplanes coming from the nearby Denver International Airport. The object appeared gray in color, no lights, no visible vapor trails, and no sound emitting from the object. It caught my attention because after looking at the flying object for a few seconds, I realized I couldn't pinpoint what type of flying craft it was.  It seemed to look as if though it was flying in a straight motion, but had the appearance it was rotating and changing its position within the flight path. At one moment I thought I could see wings, but it would quickly change into an unrecognizable shape. I also thought that it could have been a bunch of balloons banded together, but i've seen those before. And helium balloons travel upward, this object was traveling in a straight pattern, never escalating its height. Another odd factor was that caught my attention was that it was not making any sound. I'd say it was maybe 700-750ft off of the ground, close enough to be able to hear an aircraft sound. I would know that, because other aircraft pass overhead at much higher alltitudes in Denver, and the sounds are easily distinguishable during the time the object was witnessed. And I say 700ft, because the largest building in Denver is the Republic Plaza, which is at 714ft. And this object was definitely within that range.. The Object traveled silently , and eventually just disappeared out of site. That too seemed also a little strange, because the visibility was still clear enough to see aircraft coming too and from the nearby Rocky Mountains. However this craft seem to loose visibility. As it would move farther, the shape would also still keep changing. This will have been my second time seeing UFO in two different States.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
White object, ufo, changing shape, moving North of Denver;2008-01-20 09:20:00;7 minutes;White object, ufo, changing shape, moving north of Denver My son and I were on our way to church in southeast Denver on the morning of January 20, 2008 (Sunday).   I looked up, as I was driving, and saw a white object through my windshield.  It seemed to be moving and changing shape.  I asked my 12 year old son if he saw it too and he said Yes.   I continued to drive west, the object northwest of us.  ((name deleted)) kept the object in view and tried to take photos with our cell phones.   I had to keep my eyes on the road - but the last time I looked up to see  the object I also saw a dark shape to its left. Feel free to call me with questions.  I have not yet evaluated the photos.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Pulsed Contrail;2008-12-02 13:00:00;10 minutes;As a 76 year old photo hobbyist and a former Navy aerial photographer for ten years I stopped by Washington Park Lake in Denver to enjoy the tranquility and take some autumn pictures.  While there I saw a pulsed contrail.  Above the pulsed contrail was a small object darting about making extraordinary sharp turns and darting to & fro.  Not a bird.  It rapidily disapeared behid the cloud cover or I would have a photo of it.  I did get a piture of the unusual pulsed contrail.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Three amber lights in Lakewood, Colorado;2011-11-28 17:45:00;4 minutes;Three amber lights in Lakewood, Colorado While driving home on I-70 West in Lakewood, I saw three lights in the shape of a triangle in the northeast sky.  I stopped my car, got out, and filmed it.  One of them moved south, while the others stayed in a fixed position.  Eventually, however, they disppeared.  If you look closely at part one, at 2:30, you'll see a bizarre flash of red.

Facing due N on Crestline ave in Denver witnessed what I originally believed to be an aircraft.  ((NUFORC Note:  Parachutists??  PD);2015-11-01 19:00:00;~1 minute;I was out on my balcony facing due north on Crestline ave in Denver when I witnessed what I originally believed to be an aircraft heading south with landing lights on,  What got my attention was the brightness and altitude of the the light...   Immediately there after the single light turned to 5 other lights which did not change observable distance on the horizon.  The objects then moved directly horizontal and vertical in a sort of pattern.   Aircraft were visible in the area and and the speed of these objects was far greater (based on observations only) than the average aircraft.   They then formed a line and one by one decended at a steep rate into an I would estimate to be near Longmont/Docono.   No clue what it was but definitely strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Parachutists??

UFO over Denver with two pulsating lights.;2015-11-05 16:10:00;5 minutes;UFO over Denver with two pulsating lights. Out on a walk with the dog, looked up at an airliner leaving a contrail, but beyond that noticed an object moving southeast at a slow pace.  Thought it may be weather balloon etc, although it seemed to be reflective.  I could not discern the shape at this point.  The object appeared to be at a high altitude.   The object then stayed in a stationary spot in the sky.  At this point I could make out what I would compare to two golf balls connected together horizontally by a rope.  It seemed hazy, and light/metallic in color.   The two round spots seemed to brighten and dim together as the object stayed in this same spot.   This repeated a handful of times, then the object slowly vanished.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Looks to be rapidly blinking in reds blues and greens so fast, its basically white.  I only noticed the colors flashing when I tried to zoom in for a quick video.  When I walked onto my balcony, for the video it was no longer three orbs lights but a single large orb almost like a HUGE star or planet in visibility.   After a short video, I go back inside to my room and its now still there but three orbs again.  Going on for almost 30 minutes now as I type this.  Visibility clarification, I'm on Colorado Blvd.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
