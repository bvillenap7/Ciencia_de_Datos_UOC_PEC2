A formation of a constant group of 1 dozen metallic/lights near DIA;1998-12-13 14:00:00;5-10 minutes;A formation of a constant group of 1 dozen metallic/lights near DIA Noticed unusually heavy bird activity in and around back yard and was bird watching with binoculars from hot tub. Looking at a distant group of dots that was thought to be a flock of birds revealed a dozen metallic objects darting around in the sky and occasionally creating formations. Girlfriend who also witnessed this thought they had lights but I believed they were metallic reflecting the afternoon sun. Other similar objects would dart in and out of group and come and go in a matter of a micro second. Some of these objects also seemed to trail some planes taking off from DIA. Objects disappeared after 5 - 10 minutes and shortly afterwards 3 military planes flew over.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
The formation can best be described as being in the shape of a snake;2003-09-15 22:15:00;appox 2 sec;I went out on my deck at appox 22:15 when looking North (at appox 80 degrees) I noticed 9 amber (pastel orange) colored lights (I call them lights because I could not see any 3-D dimension or structure to them) moving moderately fast from East to West. 1.  The sky was partly cloudy with cumulus clouds and I could see stars between them. 2.  The formation can best be described as being in the shape of a snake or somewhat like the number 3 with each of the 9 lights appearing to be equal distant from each other from head to tail.  The lead light, or head of the snake, was the farthest North and West light. 3.  The lights did not oscilate or change color but remained a constant through out the sighting. 4.  There was no deviation in the spacing or speed of each light as they moved in formation from East to West.  They remained constant to each other. 5.  There was no silhouette suggesting a physical presence, in front of or behind the lights.  They appeared to be separate entities. 6.  Holding my arm at length, the size of the formation could be best calculated as between 1 and 1 1/2 inches from head to tail. 7.  The formation came from the East over a large tree, in my yard, that obstructed my view of seeing them further from the East. 8.  My first view of the formation could be best described as at approximately 80 degrees above the horizon and at 1 o'clock. 9.  Total view time was approx 1 1/2 to 2 seconds. 10.  My last view of the formation, before they disappeared above or into a cumulus cloud, could be best described as at approximately 80 degrees above the horizon and at 11 o'clock. 11. There were no sounds either before or after they passed. 12. I was expecting the lights to come out of West side of the cloud at approximately 10 o'clock where I could see star light. The lights did not come out of the cloud. Nothing. 13. After the sighting I stood on the deck, in awe, for approxmately 10 minutes observing the sky and waiting for the lights to either come out of the cumulus cloud or for any sound that would help me verify what I had just seen.  Nothing. 14. While my house is in the flight path of Jefferson County Airport and in close proximity of DIA (Denver International Airport) I am well aware of the aircraft lights and sounds.  These lights did not fit the criteria of any known aircraft.  Note: Buckley Air Force Base is East of Denver and it is unusual for F16's to fly over North Denver Metro but, in the last month, there have been several fly overs going from SE to NW at low altitude and at speeds faster than commercial or priviate planes which I can only describe as unusual or concidental.  They normally fly East, South or South East of Denver.  Yesterday (Oct 1, 2003) two F16's broke the sound barrier over North Denver which made the local news and, according to the local newspaper, is under investigation by the military.  A spokeswoman for the Colorado Guard said that two F16's ... were flying what we are calling an irregular flight patrol in support of NORAD. (RMN - Oct 2, 2003 - Page 22A). Concidental?;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
4 Bright objects fly in formation over downtown Denver and the Platte River.;2006-11-08 00:00:00;30 seconds;4 Bright objects fly in formation over downtown Denver and the Platte River. This sighting occured after my initial sighting of a seperate craft earlier in the night (I reported that sighting separately). The four craft came from the East over downtown Denver. They were flying in an eratic formation at first (but still to fast and to presise to be birds, not to mention the fact that they were luminescent). They then made a sharp turn over the Platte River (now flying in a steady horizontal line with even spacing) and continued that way (West) untill they vanished over my building.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Silent V formation over Denver, CO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from law enforcement officer.  PD));2011-10-19 01:54:00;5 seconds;Silent V formation over Denver, Colorado I parked my car at 11th and Speer I got out and started to put on my uniform shirt and duty belt (I am a Deputy Sheriff).   I was facing east and as I was putting on my belt, I noticed 5 lights grouped in a V shape move over the closed bank building and flew directly over head (west bound).   At first I thought it was a Stealth Bomber, but as I watched I could tell it was numerous objects instead of one object with multiple lights (it didnâ€™t stay uniform in shape).  The lights were hardly noticeable like they were darked out or dimmed.   My next thought is it was some kind of military jets flying in formation, but as they flew past I waited for the sound of a jet engine, but heard nothing.   These crafts were completely silent.  I watched as they flew west bound and lost sight as they neared the mountains.   These objects were flying fast about the speed of a hurried F-16.  I would estimate their altitude between 1,500 and 4,000 ft.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

I was standing outside in a parking lot over looking Denver and I saw 5 orange bright lights that were larger and brighter than plane or helicopter lights.  The 5 orange objects were definitely flying in a formation and slow moving across the sky.  They slowly moved across the sky and as they went higher up disappeared behind clouds.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

I always tend to look at the sky, and today I was lucky enough to witness about 50 sphere shaped objects flying in formation in the Denver sky.   At first I thought it was just a flock birds, but then this plane passed right by the objects and that's when I knew they couldn't be birds.  Reasons being, as soon as the plane passed by these objects got so close to each other creating like a wall and quickly moved out the way of the plane.   During this time the objects also change from their white color to a black color as if they felt in danger by the plane.   After the plane was out the frame these object continued to fly in abnormal directions in the sky.  I filmed them for about a minute and half before they finally just fanished into thin air.   The crazy thing is I saw two objects similar to these object about 4 days ago and also filmed it.  I dont know what they are but when I zoomed in to the objects they definitely weren't anything I have ever seen.  They were round with like two long black I guess poles at the top and bottom of the objects.   After everything happened.  I went back inside my building and for some reason I felt really angry and agitated.  I felt this way for about 5 minutes.   I hope I can spot some more UFOs in the future.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

The objects appeared as 5 distinct white lights and were flying in a close formation at approximately 2,000 feet above ground level.  They periodically broke formation, and some disappeared, then later reappeared and regrouped in formation again.    We suspect it might have been drones, but they were very well coordinated.   We have video taken from our cell phone.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

1433 N Williams St;2021-01-31 10:43:00;15 minutes;1433 N Williams St I was having my morning coffee, I generally look out my window while I'm doing that. I looked up and I asked my friend if they could see that weird smoke trails.  The trails were long at first and you could see that there was a Direction Change in the upper atmosphere.  As it got lower to the ground, I would say within 1,500 feet, they slowly started changing directions and started heading East toward Buckley Air Force Base.  There was no sound, no odor no strange electromagnetic sensations.  These objects did not appear to be in a hurry and they maintained a straight heading.  Had I not looked at them directly, I probably would have imagined them to be a chemtrail coming from an aircraft.  However all three of these maintained a perfect formation until they're out of sight.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Fast group of lights.;2021-02-22 05:50:00;4-5 seconds;Fast group of lights. I like to watch the sky star gaze.  This morning I saw a group of lights, about 50-60, flying in formation at about 5:50.  They were a dull white color, not real bright. At first I thought it was a flock of birds, but I'm sure it wasn't. First, they moved much too fast for birds. They maintained perfect alignment, although there was some irregularity in their spacing from each other.  I only saw them for about 5 seconds or less. It was too early for flocks of birds to be flying, as it was still dark and just starting to lighten. I've seen hundreds of meteors, these were too dull and slow to be those. And, they were all the same size and shape. There was no noise, and no indication of flapping, or any slight change in distance from one another, as you see with birds. They could've all been attached to one object, but I got the impression they were separate, but moving together in unison. It was a little bit similar to photos I've seen of the Lubbock lights, ! but not in such a perfect grid shape more irregular spacing.  Whatever it was, it was unusual and special.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
