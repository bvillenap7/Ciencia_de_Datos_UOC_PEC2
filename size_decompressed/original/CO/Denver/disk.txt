Flying saucer seen by 100 people at drive-in theater in Denver;1975-01-01 20:00:00;3 minutes;Flying saucer seen by 100 people at drive-in theater in Denver Peter, I thought you might like to hear about this incident even though it  took place about 25 years ago.  It happened to my wife, not me, but I have a better command of the language and will relate exactly what she described to me.  It is a fascinating event. She was at the Mile High Drive In theater in Denver, Colorado.   Although my wife doesn't remember the year, she does remember that the movie playing was Dr Zchivago.  Everyone there suddenly saw a huge flying saucer slowly rising up behind and somewhat to the left of the screen.  Everyone got out of their cars and watched as this thing slowly rose, with lights circling its perimeter, then came to a complete standstill, hovering.  As they continued to watch it just sit there, it eventually then tilted to a 45-degree angle and then suddlenly just ZIPPED out of sight in the blink of an eye.  Everyone was astounded.  That's it.  And of course she's been a believer ever since.  There is, however, an interesting little footnote to this event... About a year ago, my wife was watching an old UFO docu-drama on tv, and some lecturer or news reporter described exactly the event she witnessed.  This leads me to think the event was indeed documented, but I have searched the internet, and cannot find any such record of the event.  I would be extremely grateful to you, Peter, if you could provide me with any information about this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
A Very Descriptive, Multi-Ship, Broad Daylight Observation in Denver in 2001;2001-06-03 14:00:00;5-7 mins;A Very Descriptive, Multi-Ship, Broad Daylight Observation in Denver in 2001 My vantage point: Downtown Denver, 22nd Floor clear of the NE sky/horizon.  On a call, I watched a storm cloud moving South, low ceiling, coming directly over the city.  A glimmer caught my eye, underniether the storm cloud, of which I observed 5 pill/saucer aircrafts.  The crafts stayed in relatively close proximity of each other.  They would swing out, in a free flight circle pattern.  Each in a different direction.  This would be my best explaination of what thier movements were like:  They had no boundries as to which direction or speed.  The would scramble from a certain dot pattern.  As Braille is a series of dot patterns to reprent a certain letter/number, the crafts would swing out tens of yards, and return to the central point, and creat a new dot pattern.  It was a sort of a communication dance.  I ran to the other room and 5 co workers came over to the window to see.  I pointed the crafts out and we each stood in excited silence.  As they watched, I scanned the storm cloud.  At the very south tip of the could (front edge), I saw a 6th ship entirely motionless, as if supervising the Communication Dance. The shape and color of the ships were interesting as well.  They were a pill shaped, most likely the size of a minivan.  They were at to much of a distance to see any detailed caps, lids, handles, or symbols.  Their undersides were a dark shade, possibly to camoflauge when looking up at them, from underniether a storm cloud.  The tops were a very metallic silver, which would glimmer off the afternoon sun, at such an angle to beam under the approaching storm cloud. -6 total Ships -A Communicational Dance -Metallic roofs, and Dark underbellies. -2:00 in the afternoon, plarty cloud sky, storm cloud approaching -My high vantage point from downtown Denver -Ships mainly over Stapleton/Commerce City/Rocky Flats area -Low pressure level storm cloud, which the ships were under, so they weren't very high in the sky (maybe Traffic Helicoper heights) -No lights were seen on ship, fore the time of day -No exhast trails present -No haze, ships has a very clear appearance -All Ships were of the same make & model', thus objects not emitted from each other -No beams, just a lot of motion and apparent intentional movement -No change in color, solid colors of the structure -No landings -No sound, due to our distance -No aircraft in the vicinty, but Stapleton is Denver's old airport, and there are Military bases in the area, as well as D.I.A. -No physical distruptions in our vicinty due to activity I, and my co-workers, were Internet Service Technicians working on a sunday afternoon.  A few were local college students, and a few just locals, as myself. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request that other reports be submitted by the other witnesses.  PD));39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

I was on the intersect;2001-10-12 15:40:00;2 Minutes;As I was driving in my car on the way home from work, I stopped at the red light turning west on Colfax Avenue.  I was on the intersection of Colfax and Simms.  The time was around 3:45 PM Mountain Daylight Time.  I looked up suddenly and noticed a huge saucer like craft stop and hover over the north east corner of the block.  I was about maybe a mile if that away from the craft as it slowed down to a halt and hovered.  I tried to make out the object as best as I could.  I didn't see any blades of a helicopter or a balloon shaped sphere on top.  I was certain that this was a Genuine UFO because when I turned off in the opposite direction towards I-70, I lost track of it and I couldn't relocate it in the sky.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Two disc-shape crafts over Denver, at dusk, resembling the recent Mexico UFO's, caught on a webcam snap;2004-05-06 19:59:00;unknown;Two disc-shape crafts over Denver, at dusk, resembling the recent Mexico UFO's, caught on a webcam snap I am in NC and was on the date in question.  However, while perusing webcams from Denver, Colorado on 5/6/04, I noticed odd lights in a webcam shot that seemed to be associated with two separate crafts, which were somehow lined up one behind the other.  The crafts appear to be disc-shaped.  They seem to be flying too close for airplanes.  This particular webcam shot is taken over the city of Denver, looking toward the west, but I do not have any more specifics.  It is from the TV station News 4 Colorado's webcam.  When I saw the odd lights, I saved the webcam snap.  At the time, I thought the lights were interesting enough, but since then, I find them even more compelling because now I think they strongly resemble the lights which were recently seen by so many in Mexico.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

The object was saucer shaped and appeared to be rotating slowly.  My mother in-law and I knew exactly what we were looking at after about 30 seconds. My wife who was driving and is very sceptical still thinks it was something that can be explained rather than a UFO.  (she has yet to be able to explain it herself.)

Daylight Disk near Denver;2006-06-23 11:57:00;+/- min;Daylight Disk near Denver I was heading East on I70 just passing up Harlan exit (right near the amusement park, when I noticed a disk like objeck moving north (just south of the highway), became parrell with the highway-did appear to be rotating, but it was pretty high up. It seemed to change course and move west after a few seconds- then it just vanished. It was blue skies, middle of the day.

Saucer shaped craft seen flying over downtown Denver from about 1-2 minutes.;2008-08-21 18:50:00;1-2 minutes;Saucer shaped craft seen flying over downtown Denver from about 1-2 minutes. I know this may sound somewhat ridiculous with most of the media attention surrounding the city of Denver with the DNC and all, but I had to report this. This is my second confirmed UFO sighting of an uknown object here in Denver. These are also my first 2 UFO sightings I have ever encountered. I was watching CNN coverage of the political candidates. I had just finished dinner as I had gotten off at work around 6pm. I walk to and from my office, so I always am on the lookout for anything flying by in the sky, as there always is something to look at. I live on the 3rd floor in my apartment, so I have a pretty good view of the nearby republic plaza, capital building, etc. The skies were clear, the sun was shining through my windows, so I had closed a few blinds, but left 2 open.  I had just finished my dinner while watching CNN news, with a Bill Richardson interview.  I noticed something start to pass by in my left window facing the capital. I see helicopters planes, balloons,and birds pass by all the time, but this looked very strange. What caught my attention quickly was that there was no sound. When something that close flies by, I always hear it coming.  I quickly glanced at the dark object and noticed immediately that it wasn't a plane, helicopter, or balloon. At first I couldn't pinpoint the exact shape, but it seemed to be wobbling, and tipping up and down in that motion.  It was hard to glance at with the sun shinning directly on my view, but I could make out the elliptical, disc shape as it appeared to continue its path of flight across the downtown area. The Object's distance from the ground couldn't have been more than 1,000 ft, possibly even less. It continued to fly North, at a steady speed in the same wobbly, tilting motion. It had given the impression as if it was spinning, and I knew immediately it was a saucer shaped craft when the bottom portion came it to view as it flew further away from the capital hill viewing area.  I cannot determine the speed, but it seemed to be flying at a steady pace, similar to a police / black hawk helicopter.  However, the object seemed to speed up and quickly went out of site in the distance. The only image capturing device I have is a cell phone camera, and that yielded no results, however it does provide a concept of where the object was when the picture was taken, and the time of day. I am not sure if anyone else had seen this, or noticed it going by.  There had to be individuals that had seen this from the ground. Anyone going to and from the 16th Mall downtown had to have a view. I am eager to know if anyone else seen this strange object.  Not sure if the military is flying drones of some sort around the city, or if this was some weird kind of civilian aircraft, but this was definitely not an object being controlled by wind. Weather.com had the winds at 10mph from S,SE during the time of sighting.  This object was traveling way to fast, and at varied elevation increments throughout its path to be mistaken for any kind of balloon or bag. I'm not saying its an alien spacecraft, but this was definitely something out of the norm. There has to be some explanation of what the object was.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Craft plummeted over Denver, CO, flashing orange and blue/green, flipping end over end, suddenly ascended rapidly out of sight;2009-05-31 18:00:00;2 minutes;Craft plummeted over Denver, CO, flashing orange and blue/green, flipping end over end, suddenly ascended rapidly out of sight From an 11th floor rooftop near Cheeseman Park, Denver, CO, while looking SE toward Glendale, one perhaps saucer-shaped craft was seen rapidly descending, alternately blinking orange or green/blue light at perhaps 2-second intervals.  It flipped rapidly during its descent, like a coin that had been tossed in the air.  It suddenly stopped plummeting and at incredible speed zipped back and forth for a few seconds, then diagonally upward, until out of sight, above and south of the Tech Center in Greenwood Village.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
We saw three objects, one big circular with bright lights moving fw and spinning, one and two much smaller ones flying with it.;2009-12-18 22:15:00;4 minutes;We saw three objects, one big circular with bright lights moving fw and spinning, one and two much smaller ones flying with it. My husband and I saw this UFO coming from SW going NE, one big circular shaped airborne object with bright yellowish lights at the bottom (it looked like several lights), and two much smaller crafts moving around it in irregular motion, like forward bakwards and making circles.  The big craft was moving forward and spinning at the same time, but very slowly, the smaller crafts were much faster in their irregular motions but moving forward with big object at the same speed.  All three were flying together in the same direction, NE.  The objects were totally silent. We have no idea what that was but it was very beautiful to watch. We do not have pictures or videos.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
large object hovering completely still, three lights in the center with a glowing rounded bottom.;2010-01-13 18:00:00;10 seconds;large object hovering completely still, three lights in the center with a glowing rounded bottom. There was one object hovering low in the sky.  I was completely still for about six or seven seconds.  There were a series of thee lights, bright yellowish in color in the center, two lights on each side above the series of three center lights, and a glowing rounded bottom.  I was in my car leaving work when I noticed it out of the corner of my eye.  It was shocking because I knew it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I kept yelling out loud what the hell is that, then as I pulled out of my parking spot into the street the object was slightly hidden by a tree, so I reversed my car as to get a better look and within a blink of an eye it was completely gone.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Denver, Cheeseman Park large ship sighted...disapears within minutes;2011-08-23 11:15:00;2 minutes;Denver, Cheeseman Park large ship sighted...disapears within minutes I looked up from my desk this morning into the southwestern Denver sky. About 500 feet in the air was what can only be described as a large disc shaped craft. It was very dark in color and show signs of construction like additional detail tooled into the surface. I was in a chair and moved to my wheelchair to get the camera which was outside and downstairs. I decided to get binoculars in stead and in the that short length of time it moved out of view. After about a minute behind some trees, it emerged again for a few seconds then simply was't there any longer. I didn't see it move or fly away or disapear. It simply wasn't there any more.no photo.

Small Metallic Disc Sighted in Denver, CO.;2013-01-19 15:00:00;10 seconds;Small Metallic Disc Sighted in Denver, CO Driving eastbound on Hampden Ave. (Hwy 285) in Denver,Co. As I was approaching the Federal Blvd. exit, a flash caught my eye. A small (6-12 ft.) wide classic shiny disc was flying northbound across the horizon.  I followed it with my eyes for a moment and then it just disappeared into thin air, which was pretty amazing.  I scanned the sky to see if maybe I had just lost it for a moment an at the same time was fumbling form my phone to take a shot in case I found it again.  As I scanned I noticed a dark helicopter in the vicinity flying low at about the same elevation the craft was at.  The helicopter was quite a distance off from the craft but it gave me the creeps as I am a UFO enthusiast and realized the implications.  In no way did I leave the house today wishing to sight a UFO, I am far too intelligent for hoaxes and am a true believer so would never tarnish the subject.....Extra terrestrial??  Not enough time to give a 100% thumbs up on this...I have never se! en a UFO before this day....;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Red round object with naked eye, disk shape with flames through scope in southwest  sky;2014-06-19 21:20:00;3 minutes;Red round object with naked eye, disk shape with flames through scope in southwest  sky At approximately 9:20 PM, my husband told me to view a red round object in the southwest sky at about 2:00 in our Leica spotting scope.   It appeared with the naked eye smaller than a full moon and larger than a planet.  Viewing it through the scope it appeared to be more of a disk that was tipping slightly up and down and from side to side with white and blue flames exiting the top.  It quickly got smaller as it moved to the south very rapidly in a straight line.

I caught a picture of a disc!!!;2014-07-04 22:00:00;Not sure;I caught a picture of a disc!!! We watched the show for the 4th of July on a hill outside of the Sports Authority Stadium.   I heard a lot of people asking, What is that??!!?  I laughed, said para sailors.   As four squirming fires fell, we could tell that they were attached to parachutes.  Snapped a photo and thought nothing of it.   When  I saw the para sailors, I WITNESSED the airplane that dropped them off fly away.    My finace was really excited asking me if I had seen the disc.  I said no.  He said it was clear as day.  So I shuffled through my photos and could NOT believe my eyes.....I noticed quite a few of my friends saying they saw something as well.   I think I have a photo of it. July 4, 2014  Denver, Co;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
