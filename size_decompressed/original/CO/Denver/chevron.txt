It had a blue light then a red light then a blue light. That was all I could see of the object as I was appraching it at about 35 mph. I began to wonder what it was because it was so low and seemed to be hovering unmoving. I eventually ruled out plane because of the complete stillness of lights. I ruled out crane or building lights for low flying aircraft because there was nothing above two stories in a 10 block radius. I decided as I got closer it must be a hovering helicopter.I was coming up to the lights now and I could tell they were only about 6 stories high so I was expecting to see a helicopter. As I passed under the object I saw a greyish black boomerang shaped object.My mouth hung open and I said aloud to myself what in the #### is that! I could not stop in my tracks as there were cars behind me. I turned aff at the nest street came to a park postion and jumped out of my car. It was not longer then 30 seconds since I saw the object but it was gone . I jumped in my car after surveying the skyline went up to twelfth went up three blocks and came down thirtenth again.There was nothing above thirtennth or low flying craft anywhere that I could see. I came around again for a second pass and again nothing above thirteenth and nothing anywhere in the sky that I cold see except plane high above (very very high) I then realized something also paculiar about the obect although it had red an blue lights (which made me originally think it was normal air traffic )I realized at the third pass when I saw the other plane high up that the object I saw lights had never blinked once any of them. I had watched it for about 2 minutes coming up to it and not on light ever blinked.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Large boomerang-shaped craft seen during meteor storm in the Denver, Colorado area.;2001-11-16 02:45:00;One Minute;Large boomerang-shaped craft seen during meteor storm in the Denver, Colorado area. During the Leonid meteor storms, a witness described in great detail a boomerang shaped craft larger than a commercial airliner that was viewed for a full 15-20 seconds as it crossed the horizon. It was viewed for another thirty seconds or so until it left the observer's field of vision. It was described as being dark, dull-rust in color with several lights on it's underside.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
V formation of white lights move with no sound;2003-10-13 21:20:00;45 seconds;V formation of white lights move with no sound v formation of multiple white lights (maybe 10) moved across the sky with no sound. It was about the size of the top of our regular brick chimney. It moved a little faster than an airliner across the sky with no sound. First saw it as it traveled south to north, lost sight of it behind a tree then it returned north to south 5-10 seconds later. this was too fast for an airliner to do a U turn. traveling north it was a little smaller and in more of an arc shape, traveling south it was larger (lower?) and in more of a V shape. it may have had more than one row of lights (we dident agree on that) We noticed that a few minutes afterward there seemed to be an unusual number of jets in the sky, though they may have been airliners and we are 20 miles from Denver international. I am an aerospace engineer and had no prior knowledge of the previous sightings of similar light patterns.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

This experience gave me the knowledge and encouragement to become a leader in the aerospace science and international airline spaceline operations. By the grace of God I currently lead the industry as the developer of a spaceship that competed successfully in the 2004 X-Prize race to space for civilian operators. My sisters possessed this same general background in aviation to confirm that what she saw flying object just below the clouds headed directly south as if head toward Colorado Springs Colorado. While looking up into the local airspace of an extremely located south east Denver neighborhood she observed  a new type of flying ship that was shaped like a open V apexes first configuration and moving very fast while making no sound emissions at about 5:30 pm. Because of its smaller size, as compared to a major airliner, she believes that the object, which flew directly over her head at about a 90 degrees zenith point could have possible been a large UVA, CUVA or single piloted craft. What captured  her attention was the fact that  the flying machine was following an  unconventional flight route that deviated from the normal east/west ATC regulated  traffic patterns class D airspace  routing support for both DIA and our Buckley AFB  flight patterns. She observed white lights illuminate near the outer section of both delta wing tip leading edges and possessed no power-plant thrust production smoke or vapors trailing it as it few at a low altitude. She does not remember the exact day but it was seen early last week around the 2ed of October. One final note in relation to this strange sighting its interesting to note that the sighting was made just before the North Korea nuclear boom test firing event schedule which place Americaâ€™s spying activities on full alert. My sister know her airplane and I believe what she saw was something new. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

A boomerang-shaped black object flys overhead during an eclipse in Denver.;2014-04-15 01:15:00;10 seconds;A boomerang-shaped black object flys overhead during an eclipse in Denver My friend and I were watching an eclipse a little while ago when we saw this really big boomerang shaped thing start to fly over us.  You really had to look hard to see it.   At first I thought it was a huge bird but it got closer and you could tell it wasn't an animal.  It was black and blended into sky, and had white lights or dots on it but they weren't very bright.  It silently and slowly went right over the house.  It seemed like it was very close.   We paused for a moment because we thought maybe someone was flying a kite.  I went around the house to see where it went but I couldn't see it.  It didn't seem like anyone was flying a kite nearby.  It was a clear night.   My friend and I are 22, and we've known each other all our lives.  I am very skeptical, I don't know if it is likely that this was some sort of alien thing but I think its fun to entertain the idea.   My friend is more skeptical than I am and she and I were both a little weirded out by the experience.  I feel a little shaken up by it, and I wanted to tell the story because I just wanted it to be on record somewhere.   Denver is just not a place I ever expected to see a UFO, especially in a residential area.  I also know that I can't ever tell the story again because no one will believe it.

V-shaped craft seen over Denver.  Also, saw fast gray wispy barrel looking craft moving thru low hanging fog.;2014-10-24 22:30:00;1 hour;V shaped craft seen over Denver.  Also saw fast gray wispy barrel looking craft moving thru low hanging fog 10/24/14 Friday 10:30 I was in the backyard when I saw a blackVwith 4 glowing yellow lights going down the 2 outer sides.  Going from my 1 o'clock position east to west.  I snapped out of it after seeing it for about 5 seconds & ran inside to get to get my husband.  We ran out to the front yard.  It had disappeared. We went to the backyard and after 5 minutes we both saw it again.  It appeared at the eve of the roof going north to south this time.  But it had undulating wings made of the same yellow colored lights.  6 of them so 3 on either side.  They were gently moving like a snake out from the center.  But the lights moved independently from either side kinda like a crawling octopus tentacle.  It lasted about 10 seconds that time. It reappeared again about 15 minutes later 12 o'clock high moving northeast to southwest.  My husband saw it first.  It was very high this time.  It was like the first one l saw again.  It lasted about 4 seconds that time. I saw another one about 10 minutes later.  It was completely different.  It looked like a wispy rod shaped gray cloud.  Either that or it occurred to me laster while writing this, that it could have been a gray long barrel shaped craft with no lights pushing thru the clouds.  It moved from 12'oclock  high to the direct south.  It was very fast again.  It lasted 3-4 seconds.  My husband didnt see that one. Then l saw the same type of wispy cloudlike thing but it was triangle shaped.  No lights.  Very strange floating motion.  It was just gliding like on ice.  It lasted about 3 seconds.  I was facing west.  It appeared   above me going west. The fifth one was 15 minutes later.  My husband had gone inside.  It was another wispy rodlike cloud going from 12:00 high to the west.  It was fast, lasting 3 seconds.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Boomerang craft-stealth bomber like- w/round amber lights;2015-10-15 20:00:00;2 minutes;Boomerang craft- stealth bomber like- w/round amber lights I live on the edge of north downtown Denver.  Last night, I saw a large stealth bomber looking craft with orange lights moving across the sky, quietly, at a fluid like speed.  It was traveling south west.   Minutes later, I saw another craft traveling south at higher altitude, quietly and even faster.  I kept wiping my eyes thinking I was losing my mind.  A few minutes later another craft flew by at a high rate of speed, on the same path as the first.   I completely feel like a coo-coo bird telling people about what I saw but it actually happened.  Not sure if this is some new government craft or what.  Out of this world technology.   Plan on taking video tonight to see if it happens again.

Dark chevron/boomerang object.;2015-11-02 19:00:00;<1 minute;Dark chevron/boomerang object Saw a chevron/boomerang shaped craft gliding southbound toward city park.  It was silent and couldn't have been flying higher than 250 feet, difficult to tell since it was such a barely visible object with no lights.
