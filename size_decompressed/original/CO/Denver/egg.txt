Orange egg lights;2012-08-12 20:30:00;20 minutes;Was on 27th floor in downtown Denver saw five orange balls as I WAS LOOKING southwest twords RedRocks and saw orange light balls in the sky coming from south to north -not a normal plane flight pattern accross my window.  Two led the way  and came close to each other and started moving west-two other were close behind and then another came into site fron behind a building.  Four started moving west and another straggeled after them-the fifth came twords the building and then back tword the other five.  I got my binoculars and watched the five head west tword the mountains -then two more came into sight- 7 in total. There was no sound -of helocopters-I dont know if they have orange lights-the craft looked like an upside down egg with the bottom cut off and there was a light rotating around the bottom. Ive never seen 7 helocopters out at once and heard no noise-just strange orange egg lights.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
