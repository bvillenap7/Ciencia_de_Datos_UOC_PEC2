It was crossing my direction of travel at an estimated distance of a 1/2 to3/4 mile distance. I watched it for 5 to 6 sec until it disapeared behind trees. It was moving in a straight line.It was oval shaped with a dull white color. I did not see any protruding features like wings or tail. Due to its small size it was hard to tell how far it was. I feel it was close to a 1/2 mile ahead. Size comparison to birds [ducks or seagulls] in the vincinity but closer was that of the torso of a large bird at 3 to 400 yards without a head or wings. The object was moving too low and fast to belong where it was. Small object. Oval shape Dull white with maybe some darker shaded areas I related its appearance to birds that were in the area  closer to me and between myself and the object. It was the approximate same size as these birds if you could see them without wings or head and just a torso. I was going to work westbound on Evans Street. I came to the stop light behind three or four cars at the Broadway intersection. At this location the street is on a decline. Basically the terrain here is part of the Platte river basin.It was a clear,cold morning with the Rocky mountains visible in the distance.My office is just 2 miles further west on Evans street.I work for the State of Colorado At A Rehabilitation center for the blind.I am in my 17th year at this job.I am college educated and have never seen anything like this in my 52 years. I've had been out of town until today [12/24]so I am, only at this time doing this report. This gave me a lot of time to think about this sighting and to evaluate what I actually saw. What I saw was this: While coming to a halt at the intersection on icy pavement, I looked to the area just past the intersection, I was slightly higher at this spot as the street was on a decline with several cars ahead of me. We were all waiting for the light to change. This afforded me a view of the viaduct ahead that goes over the Platte River. This viaduct is about a 1/4 mile past Broadway. A few large trees line the river bank on the left. I think they are cottonwoods at about 40 feet in height. That puts the trees  to the south side of my west bound route on Evans Street.The sky was clear with a plume of smoke coming off a power plant to the southwest area beyond these trees. As I looked up I was watching 2 or 3 large birds flying around the trees and the river.I then saw the object come into my line of sight from the right heading from north to south,southwest. I fixxed my eyes on the object because of its speed and course. It past by a bird headed in the same direction at a higher altitude and it was moving!!!. The bird it past is what I compared it to in size. The object was farther away and above some power lines as well. The power lines were closer in, but I can go back and visualize the position of the object above the power lines. I watched it for 5 or 6 seconds until it went behind the trees to the south and traffic started to move again. I moved with traffic across Broadway and up on the viaduct past the trees to see if I could see it again. The object was gone. I beleive the sighting was 5 or6 seconds in duration because I later later recreated its velocity with my finger and move my finger as the object moved and counted the seconds. I know this object did not belong over populated Denver at its altitude and speed. It moved in a straight line with maybe a slight incline to the south southwest direction. The object appeared to be between me and the powerplant to the southwest. The speed I estimate would be comprable to a military jet at 3 or 400 miles per hour. The OBject was not a plane.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Daytime sighting in Denver City Limits, witnessed UFO color, communications, movements of 6 flying craft.;2001-05-20 14:00:00;10 minutes;Daytime sighting in Denver City Limits, witnessed UFO color, communications, movements of 6 flying craft. Working tech support in a skyscraper downtown Denver, 18th floor, looking north over Denver, Commerce City.  A sun-shining Sunday afternoon, I watched a lone, low storm cloud move southward towards the city.  As I was helping a customer fix email connectivity, I focused on watching the cloud swirls and wisps.  I noticed a shiny flicker under the cloud ceiling.   As I honed in on the shine, I clearly saw 5 oval, pill shaped crafts, stationary in a 5 dot pattern formation.  The ships would then all swing up and out, down and back in to produce a new 5 dot pattern. (I likened it to braille patterns.  I got the impression they were producing communication with the different patterns.)  They continued to display different patterns.  I quickly put my customer on hold and ran to an adjacent room where 4 of my co-workers were on calls.  I hollered with authority for all of them to put their calls on hold and hurry to my window.  All 5 of us stood at the window watching these crafts move.   I then noticed, under the southern most tip of this lone storm cloud, was a 6th craft fully stationary.  As if in a supervisory roll, or to monitor any dot pattern messages being sent to them, idk.   The storm cloud was not high in the sky, it was smaller and by itself, so lots of sun shine.  All 6 air ships had dark bottoms and shiny metallic roofs.  I figured the dark bottoms helped them stay concealed under the dark looking storm cloud.  You probably wouldn't notice them being underneath, they may not have caught your eye to make you look up.  Remember, I was on the 18th floor looking across to them.   They flew over the area of Rocky Mountain Arsenal State Park, or the Oil Refinery in Commerce City.  The was no lights, no sounds, no flares or fire or smoke.  The movements were controlled and intelligent, similar to two like magnets repelling, but controlled. After the sighting, I emailed Art Bell at Coast to Coast AM and the local NBC 9 news station, although never hearing anything back.   These ships were real, in the daylight, and very close to the Denver vicinity.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Two solid ovoid objects with occasional light flashes drift like balloons overhead, but against the wind;2001-07-26 19:50:00;10 minutes;Two solid ovoid objects with occasional light flashes drift like balloons overhead, but against the wind Several friends and I were taking a break from remodeling a newly-purchased duplex in northwest Denver, standing on the porch and chatting.  I am a sales professional and the other witnesses are business owners and real estate investors, all in our mid-thirties.  There had been some nearby thunderstorms during the afternoon and early evening, with sporadic sprinkles and a cool breeze.  At 7:20 the sky was partly cloudly, with more storm clouds beginning to develop and move in from the mountains.  As I was facing east, I noticed a tiny black dot in the sky about 20 or 30 degrees above the horizon, and appearing to move west very slowly.  I observed that it was not a bird, so I said to my friends, Look, there's a UFO and pointed.  I said it was probably a helicopter, but whatever it was, at this point it was a UFO, and my most skeptical friend said, Yes, exactly, it's an 'unidentified flying object, with a little laugh.  It drifted our direction much like a balloon would, and initially, that's what I judged it to be.  As it got closer to being overhead, I could see that it was actually not a balloon.  It was moving in a very deliberate fashion against the wind. The clouds were not moving fast by any means, but they were slowly drifting eastward, while this object moved steadily westward.  I grabbed some binoculars from inside and another of my friends had binoculars in her car, so she ran and grabbed them, and we watched as the object flew directly overhead.  Only two of us were incredibly interested in the sighting, so we looked at it through our binoculars.  I considered it to be football-shaped, and she thought it oval.  It was a dark reddish-brown colour -- very solid and not self-luminous.  But as it went over, we both saw a pinpoint light flash on the middle of the bottom surface a few times.  Did you see that flash? I yelled, still looking through the binoculars, and she said, Yes, I definitely saw a flash!  At that point, we both felt sure that this was not an explainable event.  We cou! ldnt' fi gure out, of all things, what would present itself like this.  Not a plane, not a helicopter, not a balloon, not a blimp, but an apparent ovoid-type craft with a single light which flashed just a few times, which we could only see when it was overhead.  It still appeared to be floating like a balloon, without slowing or changing directions, but more with intention.  From the time I spotted it to the time it disappeared into the clouds to the west, it was probably close to 5 minutes, though we didn't keep track on a watch.  We both estimated the altitude of the object at between 1 to 2 miles, but it was hard to judge.  I figured it must have been about 20 to 30 feet in length and probably 2/3rds as wide, and it was traveling in the direction of it's longest length.  Again, the true size is hard to judge, but the apparent size was approximately one centimeter at an arm's length as it flew overhead.  When we lost sight of it, we both chatted excitedly about what we had seen for a few minutes, and then I spotted another apparently-identical craft directly south of our location, moving west.  It was on a trajectory about 20 degrees south of the first object, so it did not pass directly overhead as the first one did.  We lost sight of it within a minute as it flew right into a cloud, and never did catch this one through binoculars.  But it looked like the same type of object and it was moving at the same apparent speed as the first one, and in the same direction.  Once again, I looked at the clouds to confirm their movement, and they were driftly slowly eastward.  So whatever these UFOs were, they were deliberately flying westward at a steady rate of speed.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
MUFON COLORADO REPORT:  Strange objects seen in daytime sky over Denver.;2004-03-09 16:15:00;25 to 30 seconds;Strange objects seen in daytime sky over Denver. I was in Denver on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 9th, and at 4:15 PM in the vicinity of 32nd and Federal. It was a perfectly clear, windless day, and as I was walking my dog I looked up and scanned the sky. Almost directly overhead I spotted a round gray object moving to the northeast at a fairly high speed. My first thought was a balloon, but it was moving far too fast. At arms length it was the size of a BB, and as it moved away to the northeast my eyes focused in on 5 similar objects following the first. They were silent and flying in a loose formation, and appeared like the 1950 Great Falls UFO film as they faded away in the distance. The pilot of a light plane flying south might have seen these craft if he were looking up. I believe the objects were under 5,000 feet. I scanned the sky and saw a helicopter to the north that was probably over the area of Federal and I-70. At 4:45 PM I was again looking at the sky, and to the north where I had seen the helicopter I spotted what at first appeared to be a black cylindrical object with a white tail below it hanging motionless about 30 degrees in the sky. My first thought was a kite, but when I looked at it through my binoculars it appeared like a cluster of orange balloons with red lights on them. The white tail was not moving and appeared rigid. I watched it for about 5 minutes, eventually it began to rise higher in the sky, to about 50 degrees. I went back inside and returned about 5 minutes later, but could not relocate the object. Strange objects that I had no explanation for. I am a MUFON member and watch the sky quite a bit. The 6 objects I saw did not appear any different than ones I have seen in UFO films and videos shot worldwide over the years. I hope someone else saw what I saw this afternoon and reports it, otherwise I may stop believing my own eyes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is MUFON member in Colorado.

When I stoppped at a red light I looked up in the sky and noticed what appeared to be an oval type object travelling from east to west.

What added to the strangeness of the situation was that unlike the two jets, the object did not appear to be emmitting any type of exhaust or chem trail.

Fast moving oval  bright orange/amber domed object at low altitude.;2007-05-02 20:20:00;30 seconds;Fast moving oval  bright orange/amber domed object at low altitude. Standing on my west facing porch I observed a fast moving domed oval shape object with what appeared to be wings on either side.  It was solid orange, almost amber, in color, bright in intensity and with no flashing lights.  It did not leave a tail or trail like meteors do and I didn't hear any sound. I can’t approximate the altitude but know for sure that is was flying lower and much faster than a jet or airplane. It was traveling from west to east in a straight path. I tried to follow its path after it passed over my second story roof but by the time I got to a position where I should be able to see it, it was simply gone. The sky was incredibly clear. I am an amateur astronomer and practice nightly observation of the skies. This isn’t the first time I have observed an unusual object. In the last year I have witnessed four objects. Two, including this one, that were the orange/amber color and flying vertically. Two that were silver and cylindrical rather than oval and flying horizontally. All were flying at a low altitude.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

The orb went lights out and looked like a giant bubble. Silent too! My son saw the bright orange light in the sky going West to East in the sky.  I looked up and saw the same thing.  It appeared to be moving fast straight toward us with no sound.  We yelled for a person in house to come see.   The light went off and the altitude dropped just above tree top level.  We could still see it when it went lights out.   At that point it looked like a big bubble that was changing shape.   The thrid person saw it with lights off.  The orb Changed shape like a bubble blown with soap. The size was hard to tell but it looked to be 8 or 10 feet around.   Even though it drop in altitude it kept going directly in the path of the street until it was out of sight.   There was no wind, no noise and before it went black it was bright orange.

Two bright orange orbs in Northwest Denver synchronized, traveling northeasterly above tree line, then disappeared.;2014-08-02 22:45:00;60 seconds;Two bright orange orbs in Northwest Denver synchronized, traveling northeasterly above tree line, then disappeared. On Saturday, August 2, 2014 at approximately 2245 mountain time, I was standing on the sidewalk in Northwest Denver, in the vicinity of 38th Avenue and Yates Street when I saw two bright orange objects traveling northeasterly in the dark night sky.  They were well above tree line and houses, and were coming from the southwest traveling in a perfectly straight line at a stable elevation, coming from the Sheridan Avenue area in the Edgewater vicinity. Two of us saw them.  They were traveling quietly and perfectly synchronized together. After between 30 and 60 seconds both bright orange glowing orbs kind of flashed brighter one time, then immediately disappeared, both at exactly the same time.  They did not appear to drop in elevation at all, they just disappeared.  They disappeared when they were probably over Yates and 41st Avenue area or a little farther northeast. I would guess the two orbs, or what ever they were, were traveling about as high as a helicopter flies around Denver, maybe a little lower.  Very bright orange, almost red glowing, appearing to be round / oval in shape.  Pretty good size smaller than the body of a helicopter but maybe about six or seven feet in diameter, about the size of a hot tub.  It was hard to really ascertain the size or the distance they were from us in the dark night sky and with the bright orange glow they emitted. The Denver skies were partly cloudy, but the area these were in was in a completely clear sky. They were moving at a good clip, completely quiet though and perfectly synchronized together. They were probably visible by us for a total of 30 to 60 seconds.  Two of them, perfectly spaced apart and traveling side by side, but not connected to each other. We have both seen Chinese type lanterns in the night sky, but these were NOT lanterns. These were two bright orange objects, separated by space but traveling perfectly together. They appeared together and disappeared at exactly the same time.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
