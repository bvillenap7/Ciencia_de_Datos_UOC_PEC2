object behind clouds that looked like full moon but was not. moved to always be behind clouds for six minutes;2000-10-14 22:18:00;6 minutes;object behind clouds that looked like full moon but was not. moved to always be behind clouds for six minutes I walked out of work and had to walk around the building to get to my car, I was walking east and saw the full moon peaking out from behind the clouds,as I came around and headed toward my car I saw what appeared to be the full moon in the west underneath some clouds ,catching that something was wrong I did about five takes back and forth seeing two moons in the sky, there were some young men and a friend from work standing out in the parking lot so I went over to them and said, hey could you help me out here if that is the moon, I pointed to the east ,then what in the heck is that? I pointed to the west. We all got excited and walked over to the western edge of the parking lot to watch this light source behind the coluds in the west. It was the same size as a full moon behind the clouds. We talked excitedly as to what it could be and became excited as a rift in the clouds started to drift toward the light, we thought for sure then we would know. To our surprise and confusion the object moved to the other side of the rift in a split second, and you couldn't see it move across the rift just one second it was on one side of the rift the next second it was on the other side of the rift, it did that several times during the 6 minutes we watched it, I asked the guys if they would be against reporting this to NUFORC and they said that would be fine so one of the men, ((name deleted)) called right then and there while we were still witnessing the object but there was no answer. We continued to watch the object hover until another rift would come and then it would just jump over what looked like  5 inches from our perspective and then it would be still behind clouds we all watched as finally after al this it just blinked out. One of the other men and I swore a few times we saw some kind of flash come from the object through the clouds,it also seemd sometimes to have a greenish hue to the light . it was so weird... ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report, so we have not way of getting back to the witness(es) to request more information.  PD));39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Strange object behind a weatherman giving forecast.;2007-02-23 07:39:00;seconds;Strange object behind a weatherman giving forecast. While watching the local Fox news channel (Fox 31) in the Denver area, a weatherman was giving a forecast while standing outside on the weather deck with his back to the foothills to the west of the city.   A stange streaking object appeared over his left shoulder and continued across the screen behind his head and then over his right shoulder.  I would have thought it could have been an air plane, but it had a strange flight pattern.  I couldn't find any footage after the fact, but I do know that the time on the Fox clock at the bottom of the screen was 7:39 AM.  I would guess there is an archive someone could access to retrieve the footage, but I don't know how.  It might be worth a look.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Bright star looking object moved in sky and turned red, blue, green, yellow and hovered in sky;2010-02-16 20:00:00;20 mins;Bright star looking object moved in sky and turned red, blue, green, yellow and hovered in sky I was standing on my apartment patio on the third floor about 30 ft high.  I looked out into the sky and saw what appeared to be a bright star.  I realized that it wasn't a star because of the objects slow movement.  It didn't have any of the typical characteristic movement patterns of a plane either.  I got my sister from inside to come observe with me.  She also agreed that it didn't appear to be anything like a plane or anything that she recognized.  The object still had a bright iridescent white shine as it slowly moved.  As I watched it more, the object seemed to dim in radiance of the white glow being shown, as if the light was being dimmed down.  The object seemed to stay in one place and then slowly move in a linear fashion.  Not anything like any aircraft.  The object then appeared to start flashing different colors. It would flash a bright red, then bright green, bright blue, and yellow and then back to white in no particular order.  It seemed like the entire object donned the color that it turned to, much unlike blinking aircraft lights that are separated by wing space.  As the object turned different colors it seemed to hover in one place.  It would then slowly do a somewhat figure eight pattern or a circular movement pattern and would at instances seemingly accelerate very quickly and then slow back down and then just hover in place.  It kept doing this and I went inside after about 20 minutes.  I came back out hours later and it was gone.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
On May 16, 2010 I witnessed a number of strange objects in the day time sky.;2010-05-16 16:00:00;45 Minutes;On May 16, 2010 I witnessed a number of strange objects in the day time sky. On Sunday May 16, 2010 at approximately 16:00 I went to a friend’s house by the name of Matt Oliver. The purpose of the visit was to borrow his video camera in the hopes that I'd catch some of what I'd seen the previous evening on video. I was leaving his house with the camera when I looked up North in the sky and saw something appear in the sky seemingly out of nowhere. I can't be certain how to describe its movement but it was similar to that of a jellyfish. After about 30 seconds a second one appeared. I hollered to matt who came out on his balcony and confirmed what I thought I was seeing. They began to move in a easterly direction. Sometimes appearing to drift and at other times they looked to be propelling themselves. It’s important to note neither object drifted the same way as the wind or clouds. We watched them for about 15 minutes until they were out of sight. At that moment a plane that looked very similar to an airliner but painted all black or b! lue on the bottom swooped through from east to west at about 500 feet in altitude right where I had first seen the ufos. Then directly after the plane swooped through Matt began hollering to look directly up in the sky. Over head and very high we saw a number of lights blinking on and off and dancing around. This persisted for another half hour. Also I noticed cotton like substance falling from the sky. I collected some of the material and am hoping have it analyzed. It was very hard to catch these objects with the video camera I was using but I did capture one of them for a brief moment. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source in Denver.  Possibly not serious-minded reports.  PD));39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Dark, silent object moving slowly over Denver.;2012-10-09 00:35:00;1 minute;Dark, silent object moving slowly over Denver. Working outside, late at night, my crew and I all observed an object around 100-500feet above the ground moving southward towards downtown Denver at a speed of no more than 50mph.  There was absolutely no sound from the craft, no light emitted and the craft was completely black and/or cloaked.  We could not determine the shape of the craft but it appeared as a giant black blob in my eyes.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Star-like lights moved together over Air Force base in a V formation, then suddenly began to separate and then just go dark.;2013-09-26 20:20:00;15 seconds;Star-like lights moved together over Air Force base in a V formation, then suddenly began to separate and then just go dark. I was looking up at the stars last night when I noticed a satellite above. I then grabbed my cousin and uncle who were there with me to see it.  As I was trying to spot the slow moving dot in the sky I noticed a group of stars which I thought was just a constellation start to move south across the sky.  This group of stars was in the shape of a V and spaced almost perfectly apart.  As I frantically tried to point the group out to my family the stars began to separate and then suddenly went dark.  At that second my uncle found the satellite and the group was nowhere to be found.  My uncle lives right by DIA and the Air force base so I know what planes, helicopters, and even jets are capable of. None of those could have gotten as high as these lights were, and if they were anything humans make why did they just go dark all of a sudden instead of staying lit up like the satellite.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
At least 50 solid white lights traveling maybe more.;2014-07-15 21:45:00;20 minutes;At least 50 Solid white lights traveling maybe more. Through the cloudy evening clouds, I saw a herd of white led looking lights, extremely high in the sky grouped together and some that were very close together and some off in the distance.   The first group was about 25 then saw even more following behind.  At least another 25 plus even more that were hard to count.   There seemed to be more spread out all over but the clouds made it difficult to see.   This cluster appeared southeast of Denver and continued north then they continued in a northeast direction until they were no longer viewable.   Some of the lights looked as if they were staying still then would continue once the other moved.   There was no noise produced by these objects.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

It had 3 lights, red and green... Moved around erratically like a kite...At first I thought it was like an RC craft of some sort.  But then it moved away at least 2km and came back rather rapidly and finally sped away at least 600kts so that couldn't have been the case.  Also it was totally silent but maybe it made a sort of hissing noise at the point when it was closest to me (maybe it was like 400 meters away at that time).;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Drone like objects with erratic flashing white, red, orange, green, and blue lights;2015-12-03 20:00:00;5 minutes;drone like objects with erratic flashing white, red, orange, green, and blue lights Dec. 3 2015, approx. 8pm  Two objects seen from Lowry in Denver to the south slightly east and low on the horizon as if they may have been over south Aurora or Greenwood Village.  I have seen them on other occasions at a much closer distance exhibiting the exact same behavior. No shape is distinguishable and they move very slowly, slower than a helicopter usually will, and almost hover in place at times with no noise.  What is seen are white, red, orange, green, and blue lights flashing in an erratic sequence and rhythm.  They seem to be placed at various positions vertically and horizontally.  The white and red lights are the most prominent.  They flash at odd intervals, short changing sequences followed by longer periods of darkness and vice versa.  The flash patterns and light placement about the craft is unlike any other aircraft I’ve ever seen. I thought they might be drones but if they are, then they are very large –at least the size of a car or truck, they can travel a long distance as every one that I’ve seen has traveled a great enough distance to completely obscure it from visibility, and they seem to be at an altitude of at least 1000ft from the ground probably more. I’m 40 yrs old, have excellent eyesight and have been a frequent night time observer for most of my life.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

The light then disappeared- and turned into blinking red and blue lights. The craft then moved from one side of the horizon to the other, with acceleration that modern science deems impossible for aircraft. The craft then moved unnaturally, perfoming an unnatural loop in the sky, raising 1000 or more feet almost instantly. The craft then looked as if it was shaking bouncing around in an area of the sky.

Grasses laid down in weird patterns for over a mile;2021-07-23 05:30:00;1 mile;Grasses laid down in weird patterns for over a mile 5:30 am 07.23.2021 Walked to Robert H McWilliams Park in Denver and noticed grass “LAID DOWN” in weird patterns along E. Harvard Gulch Trail. Like you would see in crop circles.  The grass was laid down in different angles and patterns and followed E. Harvard Gulch for almost a mile all the way to Sr. DeBoer Park and doesn’t disappear until the Gulch turns to concrete and there was no more grass to lay down. This is not the first time the grass has been altered like this. But this is the longest run of it I have seen. Some areas the grass on both sides is laid down while the stuff in the middle of the gulch was still standing. In some areas the grass on both sides was standing and what was in the middle of the gulch was laid down. There are large areas of 15x20 feet where all the grass was laid down. These laid down grasses seemed to happen on both sides of some of the bridges where it appears what ever did this went under the bridge. It looks like a pattern! made by an airboat when it is running on high grass in water. But NO airboat I have ever been on could have done some of what was laid out here. No airboat could fit under these bridges- several of which have barriers every 4-5 feet across - to stop large debris from getting swept through.  Some areas the pattern jumped up and was like 2 feet high in the air just barely bending some of the bigger plants over. This looks like “crop circle” type stuff. But it is lines and energies drawn into the plants for over almost a whole mile. I have tons of pictures and videos. After about two hours of documenting, it I got overwhelmed with the energy it was putting off and was so dizzy I had to first sit down and then lay down in the grass of someone’s yard. But I am an energy sensitive. It may not have affected someone else as strongly. I don’t know if anyone documents these things here in America. But it seems those visiting are leaving us lots of clues and not all of them are in th! e skies. I would love an “official” UFO researcher person to c! ome docu ment this event. I don’t know what technology has been created but there has to be something that can read the energy signatures that have been left here.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
