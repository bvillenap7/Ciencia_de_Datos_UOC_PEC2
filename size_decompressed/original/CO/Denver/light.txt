My friend and I were stargazing when what we were discusing as a red giant star slowly stared to get closer. At first we thougt our eyes were playing tricks on us but when it came to within 50 to 100 ft we ran. We didnt even make it 10 ft when our leggs got tangled and we fell down. We scampered on our hands and knees under a large bush in his yard. We kept quiet and I could see a laser light spot about 6-10 inches above the ground. Just a pinpoint of light about the size of a quarter. I  had told the story several times over the years, its a pretty corny sounding story and did not fit the traditional saucer type ufo sighting.. until my wife and I were watching some ufo program on tv and one of the eyewitnesses schecthes showed a bean of light with a quarter sized pinpoint 10-12 inches off the ground and a dollar sized light on the ground. I witnessed only the light 10 inches off the ground, I called my friend and he only witnessed the dollar sized light on the ground.

Light observed above Jefferson County, Colorado moves from over-head stationary position to beyond the East horizon in seconds.;1989-05-10 00:30:00;10 min;Light observed above Jefferson County, Colorado moves from over-head stationary position to beyond the East horizon in seconds. I am a dual-degree engineer from the Colorado School of Mines.  This occurred when I was 12 but at the time (May, 1989), I understood that what I saw wasn’t possible with current technology.  Two friends and I had snuck out during a sleep over and were at a park, just after midnight, in central Jefferson County, Colorado.  We noticed a Stationary bright light  at about 15-20 degrees south of vertical.  At the time it appeared to me as an aircraft coming toward us - as it had no lateral movement but was much brighter than anything in the sky. It kept this position for several minutes.  As we began to walk back toward the house we were staying at we felt like it was moving with us (with my current knowledge, that can be explained as parallax).  Then, from a stationary position, the light moved at a high rate of speed to the East and disappeared over the horizon in a few seconds without leaving any sort of trail.  The horizon line from our vantage point was maybe 50 mi! les and depending on the “craft’s” altitude, could mean several hundred miles of travel for it pass beyond.  There was little or no acceleration period to get to speed - it went from stationary to really fast almost immediately.  Although young, I understood that what I saw wasn’t possible. I remember it vividly.  Just never thought about reporting it until now. I truly hope it coincides with other data the UFO Center may have.  It’s stuck with me throughout my life and, as an engineer, remains the only unexplainable thing I’ve witnessed.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
I witnessed 2 unusual and unidentifiable light sources in the sky above Denver. It was an unseasonably warm September evening, no cloud;1996-09-22 01:00:00;3 MINUTES;I witnessed 2 unusual and unidentifiable light sources in the sky above Denver. It was an unseasonably warm September evening, no clouds, no wind. I was leaving my sister's apartment and speaking to the manager. 2 bright white lights caught my attention to the north-west, approx. the distance of an approaching aircraft. The lights seemed to turn as if in a sweeping gesture, and crossed each other in what appeared to be a figure eight. They stopped, one making a sharp move downward, the other repeated the move back up. The lights crossed each other again and disappeared in one move towards the N.E. I turned to the manager, who also witnessed the lights, and we were both dumbstruck. Although we are quite close to the airport, I believe that the maneuvers displayed by this light would be impossible for any commercial plane, or helicopter. The lights were steady, unlike the movement of a searchlight on a helicopter, or headlight on an aircraft. These lights were dancing, almost playing with each other. The apartment manager was approx. 38-42 years old, wearing glasses. I was 26 years old, no eyewear. I was a retail manager. Neither of us were drinking or smoking, both of us were clear-headed and completely lucid at the time of the event.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

I was giving her a hard time about always watching when I looked up and there was our light friend again. It went back and forth a small distance and sometimes hovered then just disappeared. A couple neightbor kids came over and saw it also, their parents don't appreciate this. I developed the film from our last sighting and in addition to the lights there are also steaking objects that we didn't origianlly witness with our eyes.

My 9 year old son and I were driving to the store when we looked in the sky to the north (we were eastbound) and there were 4 stable objects in the sky. 3 smaller ones formed a triangle to the east while another approximately 3 times the size of the others was to the west. They all illuminated bright white lights that would light up the surrounding sky. There were airplanes flying all around them so we ruled out aircraft. They weren't planets or stars because they kept illuminating a bright light that got brighter then dimmer.  After about ten minutes, the larger one shone a bright, bright, white light, dimmed and streaked across the entire horizon in less then a second. It was awesome. The other three hovered, then moved back and forth from east to west for about a minute then two took off west while the third took off east. My son and I witnessed this and was able to videotape about 2 minutes worth. My husband got on the roof with binoculars and said he thought it was some type of military helicopters but I'm not so sure. Just curious if anyone else has reported anything or has an explanation.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Again, was in hot tub at approx. the same time as 12/22 incident.  In addition to my girlfriend,this time my 3 sons also witnessed it. First I saw a black + for about 3 seconds traveling west to east.  I said look at that!  But it disappeared before anybody else saw it.  Then a minute or two later I saw a single light in the same general area as our previous sighting-near DIA area.  This time the object primarily hovered with occasional quick horizontal moves.  Grabbed my video cam but battery was dead, so took pictures with a 35mm (couldn't) see object thru view finder and haven't developed film yet) focusing on general area I could see the object in with naked eye.  At first I though it might be a balloon as it wasn't moving much, but its quick movements dispelled that notion.  After 10 minutes or so it just vanished.  Before this all happened my girlfriend commented there go the military planes again.  There were also 5 or 6 planes taking off from DIA right before this who's colors I was unfamiliar with, white body with blue tail's ???;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

The light was about the brightness and size of mars as visible to the naked eye. Color was pure white and did not twinkle like a star. I first saw the light moving in a southwesterly direction at a slow rate. It moved through the space of about 10 full moons in about 10 seconds. The object disappeared for about 20 seconds then reappeared at about the same location and started moving again the same length and duration only to disappear again.

A star-like object flying past the moon, faster than a jet;2001-02-04 16:45:00;~45 seconds;A star-like object flying past the moon, faster than a jet I walked out of the house at 4.45 PM and looked up at the gibbous moon which was halfway between the eastern horizon and zenith in a mostly blue sky.  A starlike object, i.e. a point of light, was moving faster than an jet but in a smooth trajectory, from the 7 o'clock position a few degrees away from the moon and headed up past the moon on the upper left side of it.  This is when I swiftly ran back into the house to grab my binoculars which were right by the door.  I came back out and it took me a few seconds to find the object, which was now heading more in a downward fashion and was between 5 and 10 degrees to the lower right of the moon, at about 4 o'clock.  Unfortunately, I could not locate it in the binoculars so it was quickly gone.  It appeared to be reflecting light rather than self-luminous.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Odd movement in the Denver sky;2001-09-12 01:20:00;few minutes;Odd movement in the Denver sky I was in bed, it was 1:15 am, and I realized it would be a great time to look at the stars since all the air traffic is grounded until noon tomorrow. Within 15 minutes I saw three aircraft.  Two looked the same, very far away or high up and blinking in the same manner I assume those are the F16s patroling Colorado airspace tonight. (Due to the terrorist attacks). But the third one was strange!!  I first noticed it at the same time I saw the second F16. They were both flying in the same direction- west - nice and horizontally. The F16 was ahead.  Then all of a sudden the third craft made an abrupt upward turn and flew in a very straight line directly upwards. After about 7 to 10 seconds, it made another sharp turn eastward.  And it continued eastward until it was out of my view (about 7 seconds or so) WHATWUZZIT??!! It had a red flash of color in it but basically was just a regular white light like a plane or a star. It, too, seemed very very far away or high up, just a very small dot. I've seen falling and shooting stars, and meteors. It wasn't either of those. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness means 12SE01.  We have amended the date.  PD));39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
20+ lights seen individually, very rapid speed, abrupt direction changes, no sounds, multiple witnesses in Denver;2001-09-27 22:00:00;1 hour;20+ lights seen individually, very rapid speed, abrupt direction changes, no sounds, multiple witnesses in Denver I Was sitting in my back yard with relatives. Noticed a very rapidly moving light traveling southeast. At first thought it might be a meteor, but when it did not burn up, I jumped out of my chair and watched it disappear into the moonlight.  A few minutes later, saw another light traveling southeast. No sounds heard. Estimate altitude at perhaps hundreds to several thousand feet.  I have seen sattelites before but these lights traveled at a much greater speed.  We watched at least 20 of these pass by traveling in various directions over the course of an hour until we went to bed. They would change directions abruptly making very sharp turns and appearing to slow down and speed up as well. Also saw one light travel south to north overhead at about double the speed of the other objects.   We had a pair of binoculars and were able to follow some of the objects but could not gain any clearer resolution. There were no flashing lights or colors.  We would see only 1 light at a time, never in pairs or groups like you would expect with birds. We would see several objects per minute and other times would see no objects for 5 or so minutes.  The size of the objects I would have to estimate as being anywhere from the size of a star to the size a planet looks like in the night sky.  This is at least my third sighting of unknown objects in my 36 years.  I have also seen previously, triangle shaped craft. Will be looking again tonight;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Odd Lights in Colorado Sky;2001-10-11 05:15:00;15 minutes;Odd Lights in Colorado Sky At about 5:15am I awoke suddenly and was immediately compelled to look outside in the southeastern sky. The sky was clear and many stars were evident. I first saw what appeared to be a military aircraft flying from south to north - a white light with a red light and a blue light on it, and was flying rather fast. Not an odd occurrence given that there are several military bases in the front range area here in Colorado. However, I knew it was not a military craft when it stopped in mid-air and the red and blue lights disappeared. The single white light, which was now a little brighter (like a very bright star), started to bob up and down and around in the air, almost like a flying insect or a moth. I knew that since I was seeing this against the fixed backdrop of the stars that this one object was indeed moving, and it wasn't just my eyes. It became stationary, and while I was watching for additional movements I fell asleep. The total time I watched this event was about 15 minutes. I heard the rumble of two other military jets crossing the airspace during this time but did not see them.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

It wasn't very high up in the sky, and it definitely was not a star! As I got closer to it, I came to a stop and it was still there just this bright object, which dimmed a couple of times, then got brighter again. I then saw it move upwards over some trees, then it moved back down below them, then up over the trees again. I know that planes don't fly like that. The bright single light it originally was, turned into an object with flahing blue and red lights. It then almost disappeard, flying directly upwards. What caught my attention, was how long the bright light was in the sky, not moving at first at all in any direction. What kind of object does that?;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

He was watching an obect in the sky, but no one else was paying attention to him.  then he described it as a UFO.  I looked up to spot it, but couldn't.  Then a plane passed and he was trying to spot it with someone else and said, there, to the right of the plane.  At that point, I was able to spot the point of light he was referring to.  I would describe the color as brilliant pink.  TA first I was skeptical and thought that possibly it was a child's baloon because of the color.  But since it was stationary, I soon felt that it wasn't a baloon.  I continued interacting with people at the party and would occasionallylook up at the object.  It was so small, that it was very difficult to locate.  Time and time again, as I spotted it, it seemed very high and stationary.  afterabout ten minutes from the first time I spotted it, I could not see it any longer.

Denver downtown UFO sighting;2004-08-23 01:00:00;15min;Denver downtown UFO sighting I live downtown, have a roof top loft. I have a hammock up there, and I went up to have a smoke. I looked up as I always do when I smoke out there. I saw movement, looked like just another star, but moving. This object had to be way up there, it was a size of a small star. No blinking lights, no color, just looked like every other star up there, except it moved, and moved and stopped ever so often. I followed this movement , thinking it was a satlite ( which I have seen, they move in a straight line, and also look like a normal star, I see these often when I camp in the rockies) but the movement was all over, not supper fast, but the speed would decrease and increase, or even just stop. So this object, I followed, and then another one caught me eye, its the movement of these objects that catches your eye. Now there are two objects, I watched the two objects fly, and stop, fly and stop. Again no flashing lights, WAY to high up to be a plane, the movement is something i've never seen ever in my life! I watched till the two objects flew behind a high cloud thin cloud that was over partially over downtown. When I camp , the view of the stars is clear, but downtown there is light pollution. I took this into consideration, but the MOVEMENT , the stopping, the different speeds. I'm very skeptical person, dont buy into this hollywood, saucer, green little men thing. But what I saw last night had me a bit worried. Maybe other people saw this event, but again, its not obvious just looking up at the stars. I was watching the sky for serveral minutes before I saw movement and the objects. No noise, no beams, nothing of that nature, they were the size of small stars, very high up, and the same color of the surrounding stars ( probably due to them being so high up, that the sun reflects back just like the stars).;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Two twinkling objects were seen at two different times within five minutes far above the Western horizon.  They were either flying further west or were dropping altitude, but both floated down several degrees in vision while seeming to expand and contract, and then finally they disappeared.  I might’ve thought they were jets if it weren’t for the fact that they left no trail of exhaust.  They both simply appeared in the sky and dropped down on the vertical plane of vision while changing shape and floating down, kind of like a feather does.  The first one disappeared outright, just fading out of the sky.  I may have lost sight of the second one only because it flew further west(?) behind a cloud.  A few minutes after the sighting, a jet with a short stream was seen flying to where the objects were spotted in the sky.  I lost sight of it when it disappeared behind the same cloud as the UFO.

Witnessed V shaped lights moving without sound over Denver, Colorado for 20 seconds;2009-02-26 20:40:00;20 seconds;Witnessed V shaped lights moving without sound over Denver, Colorado for 20 seconds On Thursday, February 26, 2009, at approximately 8:40pm my mother and I witnessed some strange lights over Denver, Colorado.   Her home is located in the central Denver area in the 80204 zip code.   As we were preparing to enter her home, she mentioned that the stronger than normal winds that the Denver metro area experienced had cleared the pollution and made the stars appear brighter.   As she mentioned the clearer night sky, we looked up, initially to the south.   As we looked up, a brighter light caught our attention approaching from the southeast moving towards the northwest.   The light initially appeared to be a shooting star, but was not as vibrant as a star and not moving as rapid as a shooting star either.   As the light moved over our heads heading towards the northwest, it appeared to be not just one light, but a group of about six lights in the shape of the letter V, or very similar to birds flying in a group.  The shape of the V formation was not perfectly symmetrical like you would see from lights on the tips of a commercial airplane. It took approximately 20 seconds for the lights to appear and to move out of sight towards the northwest.   The lights were not as bright as the lights that are on a commercial airplane.  In addition, there was absolutely no sound.   If these lights were coming from a jet or a commercial airplane, it would have to make sound moving at that speed which it did not.  Also, the lights were moving below the clouds in the sky as the clouds did not impede the lights as they moved across the sky.  The lights continued to move towards the northwest until they were no longer visible leaving no sound.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

There were 6 lights. 3 to the east of Denver and 3 to the southeast. Fairly stationary, although at times one from each group would change position and move up, down or either side very quickly and over time they all were seen to move around, so we knew they weren’t stars, and planes just don’t move like that. The lights were super bright, but would intermittently go dim and then come back bright again and seemed to strobe a little bit. We thought they might be helicopters, and drove to the east to see if we could get close enough to see shape with binoculars. They couldn’t be helicopters like we thought because we would have gotten closer, but we got no closer at all and  then we realized how bright they must be and how fast the one that moved around must be moving. We decided they must either be in orbit or over Kansas somewhere.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
On May 15, 2010 I witnessed four ufo's that looked like bright stars or satellites. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??  PD));2010-05-15 20:00:00;3 hours;On May 15, 2010 I witnessed four ufo's that looked like bright stars or satellites. On Saturday May 15, 2010 I was standing in James Bible Park in Denver, CO looking at the moon and Venus which were spectacular when I looked up and noticed off the cup end of the Big Dipper a light just appeared and began to travel in a northbound direction.  It disappeared and reappeared three times before I lost it.  Then 10 minutes later I noticed two more. One was travelling southeast and the other (which I estimate to be about 5 times the brightness of Venus was travelling northeast. It appeared as though both craft were going to collide right over my head but they just missed each other.  I listened for the sound of aircraft but heard nothing.  Furthermore there were no clouds in the sky.  At this point I dialed 911 just to have an official reporting.  Then as I was on the phone I saw a fourth one appear.  It looked to me like it was following an aircraft that I noticed was far out in front of the light (maybe a mile).  I watched the light until it disappeared! and described it all to the dispatcher at 911.  By this time it was about 22:00 hours and I called my mom and her boyfriend who came out to bring me a coat and watch with me.  At approximately 23:00 hours we saw another one very similar to the first.  It appeared out of thin air directly over head moved around for about 30 seconds and then disappeared.

Bright Lights Low in Eastern Denver Skyline;2011-02-28 20:00:00;30 min;Bright Lights Low in Eastern Denver Skyline At first we saw 2 bright lights low in the sky diagnal to eachother, then the lights moved and went to the opposite diagnal of eachother.  Few minutes later a light just below the 2nd light popped up, and literally popped into the night sky.  Then a 4th light appeared and 5th. They looked to be staggered in the sky way too low to be stars.  There's no airport strip or lit towers East of Denver in Weld County, so it couldnt have been a plane.  Satallites don't move like these lights did, they moved around eachother shining bright and fading and then reappearing brighter then ever.  They had to have been there for atleast 20-30 mins, and I watched about of 25 mins of it.  Its was breath taking, I had to call my mom. I'm just looking for a logical explination, I've seen these lights in the Eastern sky a few times before, always in the east though, and I've NEVER seen 5 of them together this completly blows my mind.   Any answers will help.  Thank you;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

I looked out my driver side window and saw what looked like a silver triangular shaped object.   I slammed on the brakes and got the camera out.  When I stopped it started to move west and the dart back to east stopping.   Then repeating the same pattern two times almost identical.   Then it moved west and suddenly went behind a peak we didnt see it again. I have three pictures.  The orginal and two I reduced the noise and shadows to reveal more of what was behind the brightness in the picture.   Very crazy stuff.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Two Star-like UFO's Seen in Denver During the Time of  the  2012 Summer Olympics in August.;2012-08-07 03:00:00;15 minutes;Two Star-like UFO's Seen in Denver During the Time of  the  2012 Summer Olympics in August. I was up late and watering the grass at the small apartment complex I live in.  I was facing east and across the street there is a parking lot.  In the northwest corner area of this lot there is a tall evergreen-like tree.  I just happened to look up at the sky in that direction as I often look at the sky when watering the grass at night. Positioned above the tip top of the evergreen tree I saw what looked like a large bright star.  It looked like just a typical star, white in color, but noticeably larger, like six stars together.  It was not physically over the tree, but its position in the sky was above the tip of the tree.  I must admit I go a little alarmed because I had heard about alien abductions.  I decided to communicate with it.  But I did this inaudibly.  I sent a thought/question to it and asked if it was from the Christ (meaning Jesus).  And, if so would it blink off and back on again. The star dimmed down, like it had a dimmer switch, until it was not visible and lit up again. I then asked if it was here for the rapture.  The star dimmed down again, but this time it dimmed down and lit up twice and, the second lighting it appeared brighter than before. I need to add that sometime during this occurence, a young man was walking across the street going southbound and I asked him if he could see that huge star.  He said something inaudible and smiled/laughed and kept walking. As I kept watching the star, it started to slowly ascend upward.  As it was doing this, off to the right, another star (this one was like an ordinary star in size) started ascending upward and to the left, like at a 45 degree angle as if going toward the larger star. Both objects went upward and out of sight.  The ascension was not swift, but slow.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Triangular light formation over Denver on the 4th.;2013-07-04 21:00:00;~5 minutes;Triangular light formation over Denver on the 4th. My girlfriend and I were watching fireworks from our balcony on the 8th floor.  Looking directly North we have an open view of the city.  I'm not sure the exact time as the fireworks started about 21:00 hours and continued for most of the night but my best estimate would be somewhere around 22:00-23:00 hours. As we watched the fireworks over the city we both noticed three lights moving around about 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  Their distance from us was hard to judge but my impression was that it was a good distance away &gt4 miles.  The lights seemed to fade in and out of sight in order from three to one then three again.   The three lights maintained what seemed an equal distance from each other at all times.  A perfect formation in a triangular shape.  If the lights were on the corners of a flat triangular shape then the flat plane of that object looked to be twisting and rolling slowly but the lights remained visible.  The size of the lights were much larger than any of the surrounding fireworks which made them stand out more and the color was the light yellow of a typical street light as I recall.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Bright white orbs or points of light in cloud.;2013-12-31 20:20:00;30 minutes;Bright white orbs or points of light in cloud I noticed four incredibly bright orbs (or perhaps they were points of light from beams) inside a cloud near my house.  The orbs would meet near the middle of the cloud then each go in separate directions to skirt the edge of the cloud.   They did not make predictable circular patterns or back and forth patters such as from a spotlight on the ground, but rather changed course to stay within the boundaries of the kidney-bean shaped cloud.   There were no spotlights on the ground such as those you see during grand openings, and  frankly, the orbs were too bright, incredibly bright.  When I did see a shaft of very faint light, it seemed to be coming from ABOVE the cloud.  I am hoping there is a mundane explanation for this but I have never in my life seen anything like it.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Green light moving erratically over Stapleton at 3 am.;2014-01-18 03:10:00;2 minutes;Green light moving erratically over Stapleton at 3 am On my way to work at 3 am I observed a bright green light moving erratically in the sky over the Stapleton neighborhood near the old airport tower.  The speed at which it moved and change direction indicated that it was not an airplane or helicopter.  It was moving north to south then dipped quickly out of sight.  It made no noise and reappeared moving slowly, the bright green light turned to red then to a white light, it then quickly dipped down again out of sight.  I have a science background and am very analytical, but I can't explain what it was that I was seeing.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Bright light hovering at DIA.;2014-06-14 20:30:00;3-4 minutes;Bright light hovering at DIA. We were at DIA catching a flight to Boston.  Our flight had been delayed for several hours due to mechanical errors and then poor weather conditions, so we were on the runway waiting to depart along with several other airplanes that were also delayed.  Our plane was just sitting on the runway waiting for other planes to lift off.  I was looking out the window watching how many planes were just sitting there as it was a really weird to see 8-10 planes lined up like that. It was then that I noticed a small bright light becoming larger and brighter at around 3000 ft and about a ¼ of a mile away from our plane.  I think we were looking towards the South, but I don’t know that for sure.  It was too low to be a planet or star and it was most definitely not a plane or helicopter as it sat stationary.  I asked my friend sitting next to me what she thought it was and she said she thought it was a satellite.  I laughed and said that there was no way it could be a satellite as it was just sitting there and the fact that it was so low and bright, that no satellite could do that, so I kept watching.  This is where it got really weird. It first appeared as a small white-yellowish light that became larger and brighter right in front of my eyes.  Then it became about the size of a dime (a little smaller actually) at arm’s length. It sat there for about 45-60 seconds, moved a little to the left, and then it disappeared. I pointed out to my friend that it just disappeared and she said, “Well, that’s not a satellite then!”  I kept looking to see if it would come back and it did!  This time, it did the exact same thing as before, starting out as small, got bigger and brighter, stayed put for a bit, and then moved to the left, and then it disappeared again.  But this time, my friend saw it come back and watched it do exactly what I described the first time.  We were blown away as it seemed to be observing all the aircrafts lined up waiting to take off. As we were complaining about just sitting on the runway with no movement, it came back a 3rd time and made itself known in the exact same fashion as the previous events.  This time I took a picture of it with my new phone.  I haven’t figured out a way to make the picture bigger or clearer yet, but I’m excited to see what it’ll look like once I do. Also, the following night in Cape Cod, I and 2 other friends had another sighting that just blew our minds!  I’ll make another report for that sighting under the state of Massachusetts in a little while.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

15-25 light orbs over southwestern Denver.;2014-07-15 21:45:00;15 minutes;15-25 light orbs over Southwestern Denver I was in my backyard, when I took a quick glance at the sky and noticed there were 15 to 25 light orbs in the sky.  These orbs were white/blue and were flying together in a weird pattern.  I stopped and stared at them for about 20 seconds because I had never seen anything like that before.  I then ran inside my home to let my brother, cousin and mom know what I was seeing and we quickly ran outside to our backyard to see what was going on. These light orbs were flying toward Northeast Denver and were very silent.  As they were heading Northeast, I noticed another orb light flying at a higher rate of speed and caught up to the rest of the orbs.  We continued observing them as they flew through the clouds.  We noticed that three of them stopped and we lost site rest of the rest.  These three orbs were stationary for about 5-10 minutes and then disappeared.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Light disappears, moves, reappears, and shoots short lightning-like discharge.;2015-08-04 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Light disappears, moves, reappears, and shoots short lightning-like discharge. At first, I saw a light in the sky, assumed it was an airplane, except that it was a bit brighter, and there were no blinking lights on it, which is something that always gets my attention.   Then the light went completely black, just disappeared, a little bit like how a satellite goes out gradually, but this was not like that, the light instantly went out.  I felt right away that I was seeing something unusual, so I decided that I would keep looking in the area of the sky to see if it would reappear.   About a minute or so it did reappear, some distance away.  I was looking to the west, and it was shortly after the sky had become completely dark.  The light was traveling from south to north.  It disappeared slightly to the southwest, and reappeared slightly to the northwest.  At that time, I believe that it blinked off and on once or twice, and then there was what appeared to be an electrical discharge, vertically.  It was like a very short bolt of lightning, except whiter, and perfectly straight, which I estimate took up about one to two degrees of distance in the sky (or, about the thickness of my finger at arm's length).  I almost had the feeling that the light itself had moved vertically, and almost instantly. It then disappeared and stayed that way.    It definitely got my attention.  I felt that I had seen something very out of the ordinary.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Pink flying object that disappeared into clouds;2017-10-31 02:30:00;3 minutes;Pink flying object that disappeared into clouds I have an old dog who wakes me up to go potty at all hours of the night.  She woke me up at 2:30 on the morning of October 31 and we went outside to my backyard.  I live in the approach zones for DIA so I see many aircraft flying overhead with their landing lights on for their approach to the airport.  There are 3 safety approach zones for the airport for all but police and emergency aircraft, usually helicopters.  One goes west to east, another goes south to north and the last fro southwest to the northeast. As I was sitting watching my dog I notice an unusual aircraft flying out of the normal safety zones.  I was flying way north of the west to east zone and perpendicular to the south to north zone crossing the southwest to northeast zone.  Next its landing lights were pink, not white or yellow.  It also did not have any navigation lights flashing.  The craft was moving rather slowly then came to a complete stop for about a minute or longer.  Then it started moving again.  It disappeared into the clouds.  The entire time there was not a sound of any kind made not even my dog.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Erratically moving light fading inconsistently in and out above Denver.;2019-05-25 22:00:00;30 minutes;Erratically moving light fading inconsistently in and out above Denver While in our backyard enjoying an evening fire, we noticed a bright light moving from the south, but the light was fading in and out at an inconsistent rate, sometimes fading, sometimes blinking in and out.  As we watched the light moving, it began to slow down, and began moving erratically.  After about 10 minutes, it seemed to turn east, and while its movement east was not consistent, it remained on that general course, the light fading in and out/blinking in and out the entire time.  It finally grew too distant to see.  This was definitely not an aircraft, since the fading/blinking was not consistent like an aircraft's warning lights, and was also only white, no green or red light detectable.  The intensity of the light when it was at its brightest reminded me of a satellite when the sun catches it just right, perhaps even brighter.  We did wonder if this was the reported asteroid that was supposed to be at its closest approach tonight, given the inconsistent brightness, but the fact that it fairly quickly changed course to the east, and did not travel in a straight line makes it difficult to pin down.   We do have about 3 minutes of cellphone video of the event, with another star visible for reference.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

It looked like as balloon at the height of about 2,000 feet in the sky. It was definitely not a balloon. We looked at it through binoculars and we came to believe it may be what people describe as an orb. It was very bright and white, I would compare it to the brightness of Venus. Had it been night, we would have definitely dismissed it as a very bright star. It maintained it’s position in the sky as clouds moved past. This event took place over about 30 minutes and during that entire time it never moved. A years ago I reported 7 objects identical to this single object. In that event, they changed position relative to each other, but maintained a central point. The moment I saw this single object I was amazed how much it was the same as the multiple object event a year ago. The next day on the App, Nextdoor, there was a very long thread about this event.

This objects appearance is a regular event in Denver I have several photos and videos saved from the app that I’d be happy to forward.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
