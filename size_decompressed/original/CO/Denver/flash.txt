One flashing ball of light and 9 other balls of light in the Denver sky.;2014-11-18 23:00:00;1 hour;One flashing ball of light and 9 other balls of light in the Denver sky. I didn't see stars out last night.  I saw 10 small balls of light in the sky.  One of them was flashing.  They seemed to be in a formation.  They would disappear.  Only the flashing one would remain and then all 10 would reappear.   I live downtown.  The lights were out east.  My guess is near BAFB.

A cluster of lights moving quickly in my video from right to left at 4 seconds in my video.;2018-06-11 14:00:00;15 seconds;A cluster of lights moving quickly in my video from right to left at 4 seconds in my video. I was on a plane flying from Dallas to Denver and was using my IPhone to video tape a plane an another object that was likely another plan that was flying near my plane.  The questionable object was flying from my left to right and I was following it with my phone.  However, when I showed my wife the video upon my return to Dallas, she noticed a flash that went from right to left at the 4 second spot of the 15 second video.  I slowed it down and it looks like a cluster of lights in a circular pattern.  I will submit the video following this submission, but I can't figure out what it is. ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the video in question, and our guess is that the flash of light was caused by a reflection from the inside surface of the aircraft's window.

I saw a UFO in the sky while I was on an airplane;2018-08-18 23:46:00;15 seconds;I saw a UFO in the sky while I was on an airplane On August 18th, 2018 I was on an airplane flying from North Carolina to Los Angeles.  When we were passing Denver, Colorado, (or close to Denver, according to the airplane map), I opened my window and saw that there was a thunderstorm a couple of miles away.  I was sitting on the left side of the plane in the window seat, and the storm was directly in front of my window.  I pulled out my phone to take a video of the lightning because I thought it looked pretty cool from how high up we were.  While I was filming, I noticed a flashing red and white light flying.  It was flying the opposite direction of the plane I was in.  The object was flying in a straight line, and then it started to lower, stopped blinking for a second, and then when it started blinking again, it was up high again as if it had reversed.  It then kept flying away.  It looked almost like a drone, but because of how high up we were, there’s no way it was a drone or a building light, etc.  I also thought it could’ve been! a plane, but because of how quickly it moved, I didn’t think it could be that either.  I think I would of been able to see the outline of the plane if that had been what it was also.  It was very small and I didn’t see it’s shape because of how dark it was.  I caught it all on video though and it still confuses me.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

It was going West and flashed 3 times slowly while moving along the sky.  After the third flash, it disappeared into the sky.  At first, I thought it behind some clouds because of the way it disappeared but realized it was a clear sky after I let it sink in.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
