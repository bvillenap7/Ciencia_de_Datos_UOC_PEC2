Very large, boomerang shaped object, silently moving slowly at treetop height East to West with no wind disturbance.;1973-08-06 22:00:00;3-5 miutes;Very large, boomerang shaped object, silently moving slowly at treetop height East to West with no wind disturbance. I indicated that the craft sighted was triangle but it was really more of a boomerang shape. This thing was very large, at least a city block long from tip to tip and had dim white lights all around the edges. The color was gray/black and it blocked out the stars above as it passed over us at approximately tree top level and very slowly. There was no sound, nor was there any wind disturbance of any kind.  We kept asking each other do you see that??? and I even pinched myself to make the point of conciousness on my part clear to myself. We did not notice it until it was almost directly above us as we sat in my '63 chev convertable with the top down (facing north) and we watched as it slowly made its way west and disappeared into the distance. The strangest part I thought was the fact that none of us were frightened by this unusual event. This was in a place that we called space country because there was not much of anything but space out there in the early 70's. Dirt roads and wheat and corn fields with nobody out there but us usually. We would go out late at night and hotrod our cars along the dirt roads. The area is what is now Aurora, CO. Back then it was approximately 15 minutes east of the old Stapleton International Airport via I-70. Later, a few weeks? we were out there again and it was day time and we noticed a few radar domes nearby where the sighting took place and speculated that the craft was spying on the installation which we found out was Buckley Air National Guard Base rumoured to be a testing ground for experimental aircraft. The craft we saw as related here, in my opinion, was not made by humans. It far surpassed any of the stealth type aircraft that I have seen currently deployed by our USAF. It is something I will never forget and would have reported before but, did not know that there was anyplace TO report it until finding your website tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We looked up at the same time an observed a very large triangular craft or object moving slowly from north to south.  The underside looked grey and the triangle tips were drakly colored.  It had no lights or markings and made no sounds. It seemed to be cruising very low, perhaps only a few hundred feet above us.

One hovered over our home, the other flew over at just above treetop level.  A third was seen in the distance as a red light falling from one of the craft to the ground. My husband, myself, and our 2 sons, ages 2yrs, and 1 year old were moving into our new house on March 17th, 1977.  I remember the date clearly because it was my younger sons 1 year old birthday.  I was in the house unpacking with my 1 year old, and my husband and older son were outside getting things from the truck.  It was dark by this time, but we had the porch lights on.  This was in the sante fe area of Denver, Colorado, which is a fairly heavily populated area of Denver. At approximately 7:30 pm, my husband came running into the house, and yelling my name.  He was very agitated, and nearly speechless,and he just kept saying my name while dragging me out to the back side of the house. I would say no more than 30 seconds had past between him racing into the home, and he and I going back outside.  When I got out there he began to tell me what had happened to him.  He said he was bending down in the cab of the truck to retrieve a box when it lit up like someone had placed a powerful flashlight over his shoulder.  He looked over his shoulder and saw a craft hovering, with no sound, right at treetop level over our home.  It had ice cube shaped lights on it, which were flashing in a circular movement around the object.  The craft itself was spherical in shape.  As soon as he saw it, he raced in the house to get me.  My 2 year old was left outside by himself, and he has no memory of the event. By the time I came outside, the object was in the distance, and it looked like a very large, bright star to me.  I had jumped up on the cab of the truck for a better look, and began to search the sky.  As I looked up and behind me, I saw another craft that was very low to the ground flying right over my head.  It was higher than treetop level, but not by much.  This craft was triangular, had 3 very large amber colored lights on the bottom of it.  It was close enough that I was able to make out some of the mechanical lines of the craft on its bottom part.  There was no sound at all, and it just drifted past.  I watched it until I could not make it out anymore. The other craft (the first one spotted) had now appeared to stop and hover over the far mountains.  It was blinking, and then appeared to change shape and color.  It went from white, to gold, to pale red, and changing shapes.  It was too far away to tell the exact shapes, but it did not stay spherical.  Then a round, very bright red light seemed to drop from it, and float to the ground, leaving a trail as it did. The main craft then turned bright white and circular again, and moved off toward Boulder, CO. We watched it until we couldn't make it out anymore. Approximately 3 to 5 minutes later, a number of helicopters and planes we suspected were military buzzed around our home.  They searched the area for about 5 minutes, then moved off. There were several cars that had stopped by our home, gotten out of their cars and watched the crafts as well.  We talked with them, but did not get their names.  I have never reported this incident until now.  The main reason I am, is to see if your organization got any other reportings of this event.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

As I came under it I saw a black triangle shaped object hovering about 120 feet above the street I stopped my car and stepped out to look at the craft. The craft had three red lights on the outside points of the triangle and one brith white light directly in the center of it( the lights did not blink).  It remained hovering above me for about 30 seconds and the slowly glided away to the north until I could not see it anymore.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

So I look for more, and 10 seconds later coming from the west heading to the east are 5 faint red triangle shaped jet looking objects in a perfect V formation about 15 to 20,000 feet moving fast and completly silent.They went right over me and on to the horizon in the east.They had no running lights or sound.And then, when they went out of sight and right where they started, a white light just turns on and looks like a bright star just sitting there and then turns off, moves over 10 degrees and turns on again.I know what your thinking, but they were not any clouds yet. Then a small plane comes in from the northeast and the light goes out and the show is over.It had just got dark and the sky still had the blue look to it. The only reason I saw saw this was because the city lights reflected off them making them visible against the dark blue sky behind them.If these are ours...

Possibly about ten. Behind these lights there were several dimmer ones possibly defining more of the object. It looked like there may have been smaller lights around it. It was fairly large and it was moving east to west just above the tree line. I estimate that it was moving at 200mph. It was about 200 yards up and 1/8th of a mile south of me. It didn't make any noise and it completely disappeared after it went behind a tree.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Triangular sighting in Central Denver, 10 May 2004, at 3:35 AM  ((NUFORC Note:  NOSS satellites.  PD));2004-05-10 03:35:00;3 minutes;Triangular sighting in Central Denver, 10 May 2004, at 3:35 AM Just wondering about this and tossing in my two cents in case any other confused Denver area folks contact you.  This morning, at about 3:35 AM, I had a pretty amazing sighting.  I went out in the back yard for a smoke and, as is my habit, I scanned the sky while puffing away.  I noticed a star moving, then another near it.  After checking to make sure it wasn't illusory movement, I noticed a third.  Basically, it was a triangular formation, two lights leading with the third trailing them.  The formation came in from the south-east.  As if that wasn't enough, as the trio passed directly overhead, a fourth appeared, joined the trio, and seemed to drop in altitude (perhaps because it definitely grew much larger and brighter than the other three).  The fourth came in from the east,  then changed course and speed to match the trio the fourth partner sped off ahead of the trio to the north-east.  The trio followed slowly, taking about 3 minutes to cross the sky and disappear.  (By the way, I say trio rather than HUGE black triangle because the stars only semed to dim and blur as the triangular formation crossed them, rather than completely blocking stars as I expect an intervening triangular vehicle would.)  Anyway, I was amazed and felt fortunate.  Nope, I wasn't inebriated/chemically-modified in any way (besides the nicotine).  Just amazed.

My roommate & I were sitting in the backyard, at 12th & Ulster Streets. My roommate said What the hell is that?, I looked up and saw a fat triangle shape with lights (Six?  I forgot already). It was flying south-west. If I were looking at a car on the road, I would guess it was going about 60 mph.  The triangle shape was clear, but there was a hazy, soft fuzziness about the object. It did not make any sound.  The lights were not clear and sharp. There weren't any clouds in the sky. Several visible stars, but too much light in the city to see many. A jet followed but by the size of the jet (very tiny to the eye), I don't think it was near the object.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Second photograph dictates the object being within 1 mile of our residence and on an axis as if it were turning.  The Third photo dictates the object level again, headed south. Fourth photo shows no object in site. The object was shaped almost like an airplane however the speed it was moving was much too fast, so fast that we didnt notice that we actually had seen anything until we looked at the photos- and NO noise was heard.

About 5 minutes passed and then the helicopter returned and circled about 3 more times before leaving.  We then saw the UFO fly right above our deck traveling west.

Flying object with Triangular shaped aura spotted in Denver;2007-05-20 23:54:00;20 Seconds;Flying object with Triangular shaped aura spotted in Denver I didn’t really know what to do so I googled and found this site.  I am too freaked out to tell anyone else, especially since no one would believe me.  I was out smoking a cigarette on my patio when I saw it.  I probably wouldn’t have noticed, but a group of people in the grocery store parking lot across the street from my apartment started honking their horns at one another.  I saw them get out of their cars and point up at the sky.  DIA airport faces in the same direction, so always see when planes when they are coming and landing… but this was most definitely no plane.  I saw a light that would have looked like a twinkling star, except for a triangular shaped bright-aura surrounding it.  It was hovering above ground a couple hundred feet for a few seconds, and then shot up higher into the sky faster than any aircraft I’ve ever seen. Then it slowed down, did a zigzag up higher while going north, then disappeared.  I went inside immediately and sat down, a little disturbed by what I saw to make sense of anything.  I went back outside after a few minutes to see if the people who had also spotted it were still there, but they had left.  It was way, WAY too fast to be a helicopter, and there is no plane I’ve seen that could do such maneuvering.  I really hope other people in Denver send you info on seeing something like this tonight.  I wasn’t a believer until now.

Pale blue lights hover near Denver, Colorado in V formation;2009-12-31 21:00:00;--;Pale blue lights hover near Denver, Colorado in V formation When returning home from dinner on New Year‘s Eve 2009, at about 9:00 pm, we noticed unusual lights in the sky just east of Denver, Colorado.  There were three lights in a “V” formation which were pale blue in color, and the outer two lights kept changing in their intensity - “twinkling” in unison, while the center light at the tip of the “v” remained stable.   Because Denver International Airport is nearby, we thought at first the lights might belong to commercial or private aircraft -- but on closer observation we noticed there were no regulation aviation strobes.   Also, the lights hovered in the same location for the entire 15 minutes we watched.   We went indoors when the cold finally got to us and tried to find a window from which they were visible, but trees blocked our view.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

It was so huge and clearly a flying craft. A gigantic flying-V high in the atmosphere.  It was classic in appearance but must have been massive as it was so high yet was so clearly visible.  It was heading smooth as silk across the sky northwest I believe.  The lights were very faint and if I had not been looking at that part of the sky at that exact moment I would have missed it.  Although faint the white lights were much, much larger than stars in the night sky and they did not break formation which along with the documented shape led me to believe I was looking at a flying craft.  I have seen bright flashes in the night sky before that I cannot explain but this to me is hard proof.  I saw a giant flying -V that was clearly a spacecraft.

He saw them the first time and brought a friend out who saw them the second time. last night he came inside around 10:00pm and said he seen them again and again they were headed west. No sound.  Moving to fast to be a plane and at high altitude.  I then went outside and looked up for about 15 minutes when I saw a dim white light that was going the speed of a shootin star.  I thought it was a shooting start but it never dimmed out.  I saw it go all the way across the sky until it disappeared behind the roof of a house.  No sound what so ever but had to be going super sonic speeds. Last night it was clear skies.  A little about me:  I was a skeptic about UFOs being extra terrestrial until I had a orange iridescent orb come flying at me, get about 7 feet away then turned and flew off of a cliff.  This orb was a little bigger than a golf ball and flew at about 20 miles an hour with no sound.  After that I believe that its not all government experiments. I have never seen another UFO until last night. Not sure at all what it was, just felt I needed to report it.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

There was a weather system moving from the south to the north. The leading edge of the system had broken up into small clouds creating small gaps of clear sky.  I saw what  I thought was an airliner.  I realized this object was moving to fast to be a passenger plane.  However it was at approximately the same height as a high fling airliner, somewhere in the 25000 ft range. The object itself was white. It was triangular shaped.  The leading point was farther away from the the 2 aft points making an elongated triangle. This object was moving very fast defiantly not fast enough to be an airliner.  There was no sound.  The light was very good.  The sun was at a great angle to reflect off the object while being behind the clouds of the weather system.  There was no trail or aura. I am a enthusiast of military air craft. I know the difference in shape of most military air craft.  This was not a fighter jet.  This was not an F-117 or B2 bomber. I have  a physical every year and my eye sight is checked at that time.  It has been checked at 20-10 vision.  This is better then 20-20. I can see very well. If I had to guess I would say this object was man made.  I would say it is a lifting body possibly a space plane, a plane capable of flying from ground to orbit to back.  I would guess it is the new spy plane to replace the SR-71 blackbird. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

They were triangles quick and never seen anything like it.  ((anonymous report));2017-05-11 04:23:00;Morning;They were triangles quick and never seen anything like it. This morning, I woke up to the dogs barking outside.  I looked at the clock as it struck 4:23 and looked out the window.  I saw they triangle shaped crafts in the cloudy sky.  They were in a group together and I counted 5 then another appeared out of no where.   BY the time I was able to get my phone, they were gone as if they were never there.   I need answers I need something to tell me i'm not crazy.  This experience has changed me drastically and here I share my experience.

A cluster of whitish balls with blue chevron wings over Denver Colorado;2017-10-01 11:25:00;15 minutes;A cluster of whitish balls with blue chevron wings over Denver Colorado We were diving from the store, when we noticed what looked like a cluster of balloons floating north.  Approximately 15 to 20 of them.  I pointed it out to my wife and daughter.  Then we noticed they were swirling in circles.  We thought they might be birds.  I thought they might have caught a air current and were playing.  But we noticed they looked like dull whitish balls with blue chevron wings.  Still, I figured they might be birds.  My wife took out her phone to video tape it, but they vanished.   We were near our home so when we got there we got out and looked for them.  I found 4 of them so I took out my phone to video tape then.  When I pointed my phone at them my phone started making a grinding sound.  Even my daughter asked me what was my phone doing. I didn't know as I've never seen my phone do that.   When I looked up to locate them, there was only 1 left and I watched it move northwest and then disappear.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

At approximately 8:30 PM on 10/8/19 I went out on my east-facing balcony to get some fresh air.  Beautiful clear starlit night.  I looked up and to my amazement I saw a triangular shaped black craft gliding silently coming from the north and heading south about 5,000 feet up.  There was no sound, no lights and no visible exhaust trail.  My eyes were fixated on it.  It appeared to be cloaked and blended into the night sky, but because it was moving, I could see its shape as it blocked out the stars.  I am estimating that it was less then a mile away and it appeared to be large in size.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
