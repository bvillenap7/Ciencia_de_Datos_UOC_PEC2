cigar shaped object with colors of orange, blue and green that changed colors in a strobe from orange to blue to green over and over.;1970-01-24 20:15:00;twenty minutes;cigar shaped object with colors of orange, blue and green that changed colors in a strobe from orange to blue to green over and over. It was lightly snowing and dark there was one object, it looked sort of like a cigar but with two bumps on the top.  It was three colors: bright orange on the bumps, a bright blue middle stripe, and the bottom was green.  It would start with the bumps on the top bright orange, then the blue would be the brightest, then the green and it would keep rotation the brightness of the colors.  I was driving on I-70 between Denver and Golden, headed to Golden.  I saw it from the left side of the car at about eye level.  My car engine died and would not start until the thing disapeared.  I stayed there for about 20 minutes with the colors kind of in a strobe mode from the top to the bottom in order of brightness.  I was eighteen and headed to Golden to get my graduation pictures for the school album.  After 20 minutes it just kind of faded away.  There were no sounds.  I have only told this to one other person until now.  I will send a crude drawing, it would be impossible to really draw it.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Silver Cigar Shaped object flying over I-25 downtown Denver at 2pm on a clear day;2005-10-20 14:10:00;1 minute;Silver Cigar Shaped object flying over I-25 downtown Denver at 2pm on a clear day I was driving back to work from lunch break on I-25 headed North.  I saw people pulled over on the freeway and thought it was wierd.   About 15 seconds later I noticed an army helicopter flying in a circle.  I looked straight ahead and saw a MASSIVE silver thing flying across the freeway from downtown towards the mountains.  This thing was shiny like my wedding band, and shaped like a cigar.  The helicopter was following this thing!  It crossed over I-25 about a mile ahead of me, and about 1000 - 1500 feet up in the air and was about the length of a basketball court.  I watched this for about a minute, and actually pulled over and got out of my car.  I lost sight of it over Invesco field.   DID YOU SEE THIS TOO?   I need to talk to someone that saw this thing too, so that I know I'm not crazy.  I have always been sort of a skeptic but I SAW THIS THING!   It flew slower than an airplane and it had NO WINGS,  NO FINS, and NO PROPELLERS.  It was like seeing a cigar dipped in silver flying slowly across the sky.  What was it?  There were no lights or anything.  It passed in front of a cloud and you could really see how big this thing was.  I wish I had a camera!  Did anyone else?;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Cigar shaped object over the frontyard of my house flashed green and orange lights in my face.;2005-11-19 19:55:00;20 Minutes;Cigar shaped object over the frontyard of my house flashed green and orange lights in my face. I was out in my frontyard. And I saw a cigar shaped like object that was orange with a green tail on it and it flashed in my face. I watched the object as it went over my house. And I lost it in the clouds. And then I saw the object again. My friend that was over at my house came out and looked at the object. The object was going to the west and we lost sight of the object and we didn't see it no more. This happened on November 19, 2005 on a Saturday night at 7:55 P.M. It was a cloudy night. We went back in the house and came back outside and the object was no where in sight.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
I saw a bright white cigar shaped aircraft moving slow across the sky and suddenly disappear.;2006-05-10 09:45:00;30 seconds;I saw a bright white cigar shaped aircraft moving slow across the sky and suddenly disappear. I was driving down Alameda and I noticed a strange shaped aircraft travelling unusually slow.  It appeared bright white with a slight fin at the tail.  I pulled over to examine it.  I stepped out of the car and watched it move very slow above the neighborhood, it was fairly close then it suddenly disappeared, vanished!   There was a man standing by and I asked him, do you see a plane in the sky and he looked up and said no.   I said are you sure?   He said no plane in sight.   I was standing in the middle of the street with my mouth hanging open.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Shiny metallic cigar shape (probably saucer) object travelling above Denver metro area.;2007-08-21 15:40:00;1 minute;Shiny metallic cigar shape (probably saucer) object travelling above Denver metro area. At about 3:40pm on 8-21-7, I saw a shiny metallic cigar shaped object flying above the Denver metro area. It might have been an airplane, but I could not discern any wings, as I was amazed at how it resembled a saucer as seen from it's side. It was about 2 oclock high from where I was, and was angling upwards and away from me at about a ten oclock trajectory, perhaps five miles away. I was driving Southbound on I-25 North of the I-70 intersection, and just north of the 58th avenue overpass. I had just gotten onto I-25 from I-76 when I saw it. It was traveling toward the East (perhaps directly in line with, and above I-70), but then started traveling South East, till it diminished out of my sight. I saw it for about a full minute, as it was in constant motion. I have been very skeptical of saucer sightings till now. That was a very eery sight. I just wonder if anyone else had seen it as well.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Slow flying black mass that eventually disappeared behind a cloud;2010-08-26 23:30:00;3-4 minutes;Slow flying black mass that eventually disappeared behind a cloud In late August of 2010, while on fugitive recovery, my partner, his wife and I all saw a black mass in the sky heading from west to east over I-70 in Denver, CO.  To give perspective, we were on 43rd and Decatur. What caught our eye was that there were no running lights on this vehicle (I am not a pilot, but I think it is a big no-no to fly through the city without any lights on, but I may be wrong).  As it approached from the west, traveling about the speed of a helicopter or small plane, we kept waiting to hear some kind of engine noise to help us know what we were seeing (Police helicopter, Traffic reporter, etc).  We never heard any sound. Since we never heard any sound, we thought that maybe our depth perception was off and it was actually flying higher than the 1000-2000 foot altitude than we thought. We watched it continue to fly east.  It went behind some small clouds and never came out in any direction. My partner and I are pretty skeptical and are reluctant to classify this as a UFO.  Just because we do not know what it was, doesn't mean there isn't an explanation for it.  It was, however, very unusual.

During the mid-evening of Thursday, June 5th, 2014, myself, two other adults and three children simultaneously witnessed the following.;2014-06-05 20:30:00;12 minutes;During the mid-evening of Thursday, June 5th, 2014, myself, two other adults and three children simultaneously witnessed the following event in the night sky.   Initially, one child alerted all of us to something strange moving through the sky.  It was definitely quite visible, but hardly discernable!!  Shortly, I called the Denver Police Dept. and inquired if anyone had informed them of something in the sky, to which they said no.   While speaking with the DPD dispatch, and having had my phone speaker on from the beginning, she could hear myself and all other witnesses excitedly speaking about first one more, then another, only this one was sort of beneath the one on the top, but they were in sync with each other.   DPD transferred me to the FAA, who also reported no reports of activities in the sky inconsistent with normalcy.		 For the next 10 to 12 minutes all six of us witnessed in awe at a beautiful event, ultimately involving not less than six vehicles.   They were all the same in physical appearances.  They moved horizontal and rather slow, by other accounts of vehicles.  They were steady.  They were red but not fiery red.  All of them were like this.  They were definitely well into the sky.  When, from our view point, they all reached what seemed to be the same juncture, this huge white light appeared in the front of each craft.  Then it went out and more white lights appeared, only seemingly from within the red tail.   We noticed that a plane was near-by, prompting one child to remark that it was going to collide with this “thing!”  And it sure did look like this was likely from down on the ground, but nothing happened.  Shortly thereafter, another earthly vehicle went by, both vehicles heading northward, opposite the direction of the UFO’S. 	Since we’re all were able to see the earthly vehicles, it made since to me that the UFO’s had to have been relatively close, and the passing of the earthly vehicles provided me with the only reliable means of discerning how far away and how far up they were (as there was no horizon, no sky line … just sky!;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Two white cigar shaped UFO's stop and hover over I-25 in Denver, then change to an amber color and disappear.;2016-03-20 11:45:00;<1 minute;Two white cigar shaped UFO's stop and hover over I-25 in Denver, then change to an amber color and disappear. My wife and I were driving northbound on I-25 from Colorado Springs to Denver.  The sighting happened somewhere between CO 470 and Yale Avenue.  We had seen several commercial aircraft flying at low altitudes over the interstate coming from DIA before the sighting.  We then saw two flat, white discs or cigar shaped objects.  We were looking at them edge on, they were definitely not saucer or dome shaped.  The objects were moving at approximately the same altitude and speed relative to the other commercial airliners. The two objects caught our attention because they seemed to move similar to the aircraft previously seen, but didn't have wings and appeared at least twice the size of the commercial airliners.  In comparison with the Sun, they would have fit almost perfectly into the radius of the Sun's circle, with perhaps some overlap for the object closest to us (further south).  They looked like thin, bring white lines across the deep blue sky.  Today was a beautiful sunny day, so their bright white color against the deep blue back drop was very easily seen. I estimated they were a good 5 to 10 miles ahead of us, looking due North.  Of course, I'm not a good judge of aerial distances, but I use the other commercial aircraft in the area as my point of reference for this estimation.  One of the objects was obviously closer to us (further south) while the second appeared smaller and seemed to be few miles further North than the first object closest to us.   They appeared to move from an E to a NW direction, similar to the commercial aircraft coming out of DIA over downtown Denver headed west over the mountains.  Then, they suddenly stopped over I-25 or perhaps just west of I-25.   At this point we were looking at them NNW of our viewpoint on I-25N.  The two objects then hovered for about 30 seconds max (possibly less) and then began to turn a reddish orange color, slowly becoming more and more transparent with the blue sky - and then poof!  They disappeared!   This all happened in less than a minute and we were traveling at 80 mph.  So unfortunately, we didn't get a photo or video of the event.  However, it did shake up my wife and was very unsettling to her.  She has not been one to believe in UFO's and when I tried to talk to her about it afterward, she was very uncomfortable and didn't want to discuss it.  I know what I saw and this was something very unidentifiable.   If anyone else on I-25 at this same time headed northbound along side us looked up in the sky to the North-Northwest, they would have seen the same thing.  I would imagine anyone in those commercial aircraft headed west out of DIA would have also seen this.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Cigar, no wings, tail, or lights moving from south to north.;2019-01-06 07:00:00;20 seconds;Cigar, no wings, tail, or lights moving from south to north. Went out in the morning and looked east to see a large fuselage (cigar) no wings, no tail, no blinking lights.  Airplanes should still have lights on at that time.  Watched it move from south to north for several seconds, wishing I had my phone.  It went through a cloud and was never seen again.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
White cigar shaped object over DIA or Buckley Air force base;2021-01-03 16:00:00;1 min;White cigar shaped object over DIA or Buckley Air force base My son I were driving at about 4pm on Sunday.  I looked out to the east close to the airport.  I saw a white cigar shaped object that did not appear to move.  Right above it was a half circle shape that was just as long as the cigar shape.  Since I was driving I had my son watch the object and we tried to get a video but we were not able to capture it before I had to turn in the opposite direction.  I thought it was plane but it was very long and should have appeared to move.  It was too long and the shape was even from end to end so It didn’t appear to be a plane coming at us, giving the affect of not moving.  I really wanted to see if anyone else might have seen the object .;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
