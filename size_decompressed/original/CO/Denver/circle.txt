two bright round very near each other.;1975-06-01 19:00:00;1 minute;two bright round very near each other. it was about 1975 pm, as I aproached my uncles house to knock on the door, I was facing east at the door to knock on it, after I knocked on the door I turned to my left which was facimg north as I was waiting for a answer to the door, I saw two bright abjects, one under the other slightly ahead of the other, Im not shure which one was in the lead, they were at my farthest to my left comming into the picture, and moving at a very fast speed, I did notice that there was no noise or lights on them as to being airplanes, they were bright and shinny, and mostly round, and again moving very fast, the time from my seeing then at my farthest left to the time to my right took I may guesse one minute probablly less, I could now say they were about as big as a soft ball, adout as high in the sky as four telephone poles, and maybe as far out as I might guess not a mile more, also I noticed that as they came aceoss they did not loose speed altitude or direction they went straight across the horizen, I have had this in my mind a long time and am very happy to have had a encounter amd a oppertunity to document this event, thank you also the craft were very close to one and each other, maybe two foot or so from my view.

One pinpoint of light moved northward across the sky joining another before I lost them in the haze.;2001-04-18 18:30:00;2 min;One pinpoint of light moved northward across the sky joining another before I lost them in the haze. I was reading on the CU Denver campus and took a cigarette break laying on the grass and looking up into the clear blue sky with my sunglasses clipped on as the sun was going down over the Rockies.  I saw a tiny pinpoint of light way up in the sky which I first thought was a star but then I noticed it was heading northward very slowly so I thought it was a satillite.  I took off the clips and it was white with what looked like a corona.  It was very far up and/or very small.  I looked around and no one was looking up so I followed it about 20 degrees across the sky.  I looked around again and when I found it again there was two.  At that point I wanted someone to confirm it and  I got up to go get somebody to look and I couldn't find it again as the further north it went, it got into a whiter part of the hazy/sunset horizon.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Bright light hovering for a long time;2004-05-19 22:00:00;at least 20 minutes;Bright light hovering for a long time As I was goint to bed the night was cloudy and very windy, I looked outside the second floor window in our house and saw what I though was the light of a plane far over the North East side of Downtown Denver ( I live in Aurora South East) after a few seconds I noticed that there was no movement of the light to any direction and I decided to call my wife. The light was very low in the horizon maybe 10 degrees up, she came and we both stay for a while looking at the light. Then it started to move down very slow and stay hovering at a lower altitud for much longer. We went to bed and it was still there.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

And it flew right behind a cloud. So I asked everyone if they just saw that but only one of them said he did. He and I explained what we just saw to everyone. Then we continued playing when I looked up in the sky and saw it again. This time it was there longer so I told everyone to look and they did and saw it. Then it dissapeared again. My friend went inside to get his camera so we could take a picture of it. We stood there watching and hoping to see it again. We did see it again but my friend did not get the chance to take the picture due to it being so brief in sightings. We saw it several more timees before it dissapeared completely.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Large bright white light with evenly spaced smaller lights in trail east of Denver moving northeast, as seen by airline pilot at FL380;2006-10-01 23:15:00;30 sec;Large bright white light with evenly spaced smaller lights in trail east of Denver moving northeast, as seen by airline pilot at FL380 While flying westbound at FL380 (38,000') my First Officer and I saw a very bright, white light at our 9 o'clock high position. The object was just east of Denver at what seemed to be 40 to 50 thousand feet and was moving north to northeast.  4 to 5 smaller lights appeard behind the main object at even spacing, and maintained the same altitude and speed as the lead object.  I asked Denver Center (Air Traffic Control) if they had traffic at my 9 o'clock high. They replied negative. I said maybe it's space junk burning up but another airliner on frequency said no, it was moving too horizontal and did not have a trail of burning debris.  I agreed. The lights went out as they moved off to the north and east.  I've seen many meteors while flying and this was not a meteor.  It was not a conventional aircraft as it had no positon, strobe, or anti-colllision lights.  I have 17,000+ hours of flying time over 40 years.  I'm a Captain at a major airline and a retired USAFR Lt Col fighter pilot. This event was unlike anything I've ever seen.

Daylight sighting of unknown object.;2007-04-17 17:25:00;about 1 minute;Daylight sighting of unknown object. I was looking east from the playground at Westerly Creek Elementary School.  Object appeared bearing about 080, proceeded to track NNE, speed indeterminate-perhaps 250 knots.  Estimated distance from me between ½ and ¾ miles.  It was at the altitude of bottom of low clouds.  I Lost sight at bearing about 350.  The bottom was silvery, it appeared to be round from the bottom, kind of a fattened disk in cross-section.  Above the mid-plane, there was a dark patch.  No sign of wings or empennage.  No sound, although this could have been obscured by a jet departure from DIA.  I believe this may be of the same type my family saw flying in close (20 feet) formation above Westerly Creek park 2 summers ago-those two had silvery bottoms and straight leading edge, forward sweeping trailing edge wings.  We saw those from about 500-1000’ straight above us.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

So at the appropriate time we went out side to view this spectacle and what we saw was a little different than anticipated.  We saw two bright lights much higher in the sky than anticipated, moving one behind the other at a fast pace.  We observed them for a minute or two before the first craft in line started to dim out then disappear, with the second following the exact same exapmle, dim out then disappear in the exact same place. We don't really have any idea what we saw so thats why  I decided to put this up. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Circular object flying up and into the clouds before a storm.;2007-08-05 17:30:00;1-2 min.;Circular object flying up and into the clouds before a storm. I watched a dark round object make it's way across the sky from the southeast to the northwest. It flew as if a helicopter would-maybe a little slower-and made no sound. This occured as storms were rolling in from several directions. It came into my vision lower in the sky and continued rising at a steady pace as it flew northwest and into a dark storm cloud. Strangely enough, I have witnessed the same event before-right before an intense thunderstorm. It was maybe a year or two ago about a mile away from this second sighting. It happened exactly the same way, about the same time of day, but flew from the southwest to the northeast disappearing into the clouds.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Silent and Fast-Moving Orange Orb Over Denver;2013-05-11 23:00:00;3 minutes;Silent and Fast-Moving Orange Orb Over Denver On the evening of 5/11/13 my wife and I had our good friends over to our new house for dinner and to sit out by our fire pit afterward.  It was near the end of the evening (somewhere between 10:30 PM –11:00 PM) when a helicopter flew over and put its spot light right on us which was weird but also had it on the neighborhood briefly.  We live in a quiet neighborhood in south-east Denver and just moved from north-east Denver where police choppers – especially on the weekends were common so while this was strange we didn’t really think much of it.  What was weird and unexplainable is what happened next…   About 2-3 minutes after the helicopter flew over, we all were still a little sensitive to things flying overhead and we all saw a strange orange light moving quickly towards us from the south west (it appeared to be moving as fast as a fighter jet) but made no sound at all.  As I mentioned our neighborhood is quiet and neither of us could hear anything coming from this object.    When the object appeared directly overhead we could all see a light orange circular craft of some kind with a darker orange center that sort of pulsated but there were no blinking lights like you see on an airplane or helicopter.   We watched the object travel north east and at which point I brilliantly decided to get a video of it on my phone but I was just a tad too late.   By the time I looked up and my wife and our friends stopped making fun of me for thinking of this after it was well over our location, the object disappeared.  It was probably 20 miles or more past our house by the time we lost sig! ht.  I noticed another report came in from Steamboat Springs, CO that same night that has a similar description of the object we saw.   My wife and I and our friends (also husband and wife) are all well-educated people but none of us have ever seen anything like this.  Even with that said, we all kind of blew it off but I decided to check out if there was a way to report it since I have thought about it several times in the past couple of weeks since it occurred.   I’m sure there’s an explanation for what we saw but figured it’s worth reporting anyway.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Silver circle with black triangle ahead of storm.;2013-05-15 15:30:00;1 minute;Silver circle with black triangle ahead of storm There was one flat disk object.  It flew directly overhead.  From below, looking up, it was a silver/grey circle with a large black equilateral triangle across the center reaching its points to the edges of the circle.  There was also a pattern of a few simple black lines across the grey area.  It was traveling low and fast, just at the height and ahead of a thunderstorm rolling in.  It appeared to either be being pushed by or trying to outrun the thunderhead.  It was very easy and clear to see and I watched it for about a minute as it flew off into the distance. Observer is a young 30s, mother, professional teacher with no previous UFO experiences.  I'm just curious what it was because it was so obvious and clear.  I assumed it was something to monitor the storm, but can't find info on any weather instruments that match the description.

Squadron of enormous UFOs seen over denver at moment of full lunar eclipse.;2014-04-15 01:05:00;20 seconds;squadron of enormous UFOs seen over denver at moment of full lunar eclipse i was looking at the just eclipsed moon through binoculars when a squadron of UFOs entered my field of view.  they were silently flying in a flat V formation with 3 on the short line and 8 on the long.  their leading edge was glowing red.  i believe the glow was from the friction of traveling fast through the upper atmosphere.  they passed over head and to my right traveling north.  when they first appeared the length of the line was about 3 times the width of the moon as it appeared in the sky.  each ship was about one ship width behind the other. on this form i checked a box under animals responded to the event. i did notice just before i spotted this squadron that dogs began to bark all over the neighborhood.  at the time, i did wonder if it was in response to the eclipse or just a coincidence. i really don't think it was in response to these UFOs that were flying in the upper atmosphere.  but...  who knows?

Denver, CO, on a late afternoon clear sky, 5 orbs appeared in the sky, some showing a streak of light before going back to orb shape.;2014-10-14 18:00:00;20 minutes;Denver, CO on a late afternoon clear sky, 5 orbs appeared in the sky, some showing a streak of light before going back to orb shape. Approximately, at 6:15 in the afternoon of October 14, 2014 my son and I witnessed the following events in downtown Denver, Colorado. I was visiting him from Atlanta and enjoying a clear blue sky in his 3rd floor loft condominium that is surrounding by windows.   I suddenly noticed a bright silver streak in the sky as if the bright son was reflecting off of an airplane.  I kept waiting for the image to change and then the streak just disappeared.  I didn’t at the point think much of it, but a few seconds after I saw what appeared to be a fire trail from nowhere burning into the clear sky. At that point, I told my son, and we quickly went to his deck to get a better view.   Just as we arrived on the deck about 3 orbs appeared.  They were far away and looked about the size of large star.  It was daylight and you could see them clearly.  Perfectly round and moving slightly some moving faster than others. The one that was the steadiest and affixed in one place for a while as if staring at us, suddenly burst into a flame it appeared.  Making a definite light streak as you will see on the video.  On the camera it appears as white, but in reality, pink to coral was the color of the streak and quite beautiful.  In a matter of seconds, the streak was gone, but the orb remained just as it was before.  It had, to the naked eye, to not have moved at all.  As we were witnessing and trying to video this astonishing sight with a camera during the next 20 minutes, we noticed a total of 5 orbs in all.  These 5 orbs started moving toward the same location.  Some of them streaked as the moved, and they were moving due west of Downtown Denver to the right of Mount Evans.  As they approached the outlying hills, they dropped from the sky and fell behind a smaller peak.  One by one they disappeared slowly, deliberately to the same point.  I immediately called the local news channels to ask what they were.  I was hung up on by two of the major channels and finally the local ABC affiliate asked for a video.  We had to condense the video to the point I am sure it was hard to see, but as we watched the news there was no mention of these events at all.  I have called the FAA in Washington and they were helpful and told me to report these events to the local office here. Which I have done.  It does not have to be explained as aliens invading the earth, but it would be nice if the powers that be would at least tell the public they are not crazy when they see an actual event.

Brilliant white strobe in circle shape VIDEO TAPED flying southbound against mountain range.  Balcony viewpoint was 10th Avenue in Denver, for perspective, cross street Broadway.   This craft appeared to be totally cylindrical, and would go from 100% illumination extremely bright white light, to absolutely 0% and totally dark, back to fully lit, back to fully dark, repeat until out of site.  Full video available. After this craft appeared to have gone out of site, within approximately two minutes, a SECOND craft appeared (first craft gone, may have been same craft but different scenario). Second craft was full bright white/orange light, also totally cylindrical, appeared to hover in place for a solid two minutes, brilliantly lit, and then appeared to gain altitude.  Zero presence of flashing lights as would be indicated on traditional commercial craft.  This literally floated/hovered mid air with no observable movement.  Southbound from balcony at 10th and Broadway, no flashing, not sure if different craft or if same craft as above but using different lighting scheme and hovering as opposed to forward/southbound momentum. Have video footage of both.  Not exactly eager to post online given scrutiny factor.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

I look out the passenger window to the East and notice a large, bright circular object with a bright corona in the sky over Downtown Denver.  There are no colored lights on the object to signify a conventional aircraft.  When observed through a phone seems to be either changing shapes or is emitting orbs that seemingly change the object's shape.   We take a left turn at an intersection to head West and during this time that we are turning the bright object vanishes from the sky. Approx 30 minutes later we had returned home from errands and, as we approached the door to the house, I notice the same bright, circular UFO hanging in the sky to the East.  A seemingly conventional aircraft (read: helicopter) in the same area of the sky seems to be approaching the circular object, at which point the object promptly vanishes from the night sky. I run inside to tell my friend who had already gone inside to put away items. We both return outside and observe either the same or another circular bright object to West, low on the horizon, seemingly barely above the mountains themselves.  We observe the object to the West for approx 3-5 minutes before returning inside.   5-10 minutes later I returned outside to no anomalies visible in the sky.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

It had red and green lights with no particular flashing pattern then I realized it wasn’t moving and appeared circular.  it was just flying there and the second I thought this, the lights turned red and it moved to the right then the lights alternated and it moves down a bit.   I yelled for my husband because I’d never seen anything move like that- it’s way to too high in the sky and far away to be a helicopter.  Then, it moved down really quickly while blinking green lights only and very rapidly, faster than it had at all before.  It moved so fast down while blinking that it almost looked like it split into multiple vehicles for a second or left a trail of green lights really briefly.  Then, it looked as it if disappeared out of my sight like zoomed too far away to see while moving “down”.  It was really unnatural movement and in the middle of a lightening storm with no thunder.

I also took pictures through binoculars and with my cell phone. At first the object appeared faint yellow, then the color changed to reddish as it continuously hovered, moving slightly to the north. It disappeared and reappeared multiple times, but almost in the same spot. It did just hover and didn't make any sudden accelerations. I have witnessed this same object, along with at least 3 other witnesses. It was a circle, with approximately 6-8 round lights that lined the inside, top of the circle. There was a brighter white, solid sphere towards the middle of the inside of the circle that seemed to throw 2 reflective beams towards the left, inside of the circle.  I did not witness any lights or beams outside of the circle. I have heard that Denver has known sightings of strange objects in the sky, but have never witnessed any, until this object.
