Strange object, stranger events that followed on seeing the object in the Mountains above Denver;1998-07-07 17:00:00;all afternoon and evening;Strange object, stranger events that followed on seeing the object in the Mountains above Denver My friend and I and her two children went up above Denver into the mountains where there is a buffalo herd that is kept. It is near a park area and rest area so people can hike, see the herd or just camp for the day. On the way towards Genese housing development. We stoped to have a picnick and watch the sunset. There was other people there as well. There was a hispanic man standing on one of the many boulders watching the sky. I looked west towards the setting sun and thought at first I was watching an airplane. But then I realized it was round and metalic and very bright. Still I thought it was just the sunlight reflecting on it. I pointed it out to my frined and her kids. At that moment it skipped across the sky at such a fast speed. It was in one spot than the next, to the point your head had to turn real quick to catch it. It was definately faster than any fighter jets and made no sound at all. We just stood there watching it skip back and forth across the sky. I started to get creeped out and said to my friend we need to go. I looked over to the Hispanic man he was rushing his family out. It was like everyone just instictually knew to leave. For some reason my friend, who was driving decided to take the scenic route or back roads back down to Denver. It was a wierd decision because the freeway was right there. As we were going down the mountain side it was still pretty light outside. The sun had not set yet. There were these light like a negative print from a picture but they were florecent green. Not bright, but almost like an olive florecent? they came at the car in waves. It looked like waves, and they made geometric shapes infront of the car. Like outlines. The kids were scared, she was scared. I wasn't susre what to think. At one point we got by this switch back dirt road and there was a man just standing there. He was in plain clothes. And he was just watching us. We drove by him. I couldn't get a good look at his eyes but, He was so very still. We got to the bottom of the road and it was night outside. We couldn't figure it because the cars time clock didn't seem to be messed with and we all seemed to be of sound mind. The car was acting up.  We got to her place just in time to discover the brakes were completely gone. Which was extremely wierd because she just had new ones installed a few days before our trip out there.  Not an hour later there was several helicopters flying over her home and they were gone. The kids still have dreams of that experiance. We kind of just laugh about it, but we don't know what really happened. Or what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

While visiting relatives in Denver Colorado on the outskirts of the city my daughter and her boy friend pointed to the sky just above t;1999-10-31 17:30:00;5 minutes;While visiting relatives in Denver Colorado on the outskirts of the city my daughter and her boy friend pointed to the sky just above the location of the university of colorado and said there was a strange object in the sky. It took me a while but I finally got sight of a orange round object slowly traveling across the sky over the mountains. It was lighter in color toward the top and I could make out blochy looking designs around the top area of its shape. The orange glow of it was rather faint. There were a number of poeple around us looking at it in wonder trying to figure out what it was also. Then after a bit it disappeared over the mountains toward the north. Then sighting actually took place more toward the outskirts of the city and no telling how many actually saw it besides the small crowd around us. There was no sound emitting from the object but that might have been covered up by the sounds of the traffic. There was air traffic around including some comerical flights from a major airport.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Bright sphere in sky, completely stationary, then disappeared;2001-10-17 15:10:00;20 minutes;Bright sphere in sky, completely stationary, then disappeared I got my dogs and put them in the car to take them for their regular walk a few miles away at Fairmount Cemetary, a quiet big park like area. Driving southbound on Harrison Street at 9th Avenue--- STRANGLY ENOUGH where about a year ago I had a dream of seeing a UFO- I spotted a shiny object in my front field of vision. I slowed down, stuck my head out the window, and it just vanished. I thought it might just be a common sun reflection off of a plane. However, it now occurs to me that the sun reflection would have to be on the OTHER side of the plane, as I was north of the object.<P> I kept looking up in the sky casually, though slightly alerted. I then got in the turn lane of Colorado Blvd, waiting for traffic to clear to make a left turn eastbound. I then spotted either another object or the same object high in the eastern part of the sky. It was a VERY bright dot- just hanging in one spot, and rock solid, not moving at all.<P> I made my turn, and immediately parked the car on 6th Ave.<P> I got out of the car, and looked up to see a bright object, again totally immovable in the sky, about 60 degrees up from the horizon. Imagine how bright this object must have been to catch my attention from inside my car, waiting to make a turn, in broad daylight. I had one small Fuji Finepix 2.1 (4 MP extension) megapixel digital camera in the car which I used to take about 10 pictures, the best of which are below. This camera has only a 3X zoom lens-- IT FIGURES! This day I did not have my high power digital zoom video camera with me (never again!!)<P> Never the less, you can clearly see the object between the light and the curve of the lower tree branch.<P> Upon enlarging, the object appears to be a metallic sphere, with light reflecting off of the upper right hand side- facing the position of the sun. <P> I watched the completely stationary object for about 15 minutes, up and down the street, even driving around the block , and confirmed its presence by talking with about six other people waiting for the bus (they had not seen it until I pointed it out, then confirmed it was there). <P> I then decided to quickly drive home and get my telescope and more powerful cameras with stronger lenses. From my home a mile away, the object was not visible. When I returned to the exact same spot about 10-15 minutes later the object could no longer be seen. <P> I returned home and checked my computer sky chart program to see if there were any planets or bright stars in that part of the sky- and there was nothing at all. The brightest star above the horizon was Vega, and at 3 PM, it was completely invisible, as well as not being in the same part of the sky where I had seen this object. <P> I considered that it could be a mylar birthday or maybe another balloon reflecting sunlight, but given the amount of time that I watched it, its' apparent size at a distance and brightness (I could judge it was very high up from my perspective as I moved down the street, and that it did not budge any perceptible amount whatsoever during this time, this seemed pretty much impossible. A balloon in the atmosphere would move up or to the side- and this object was absolutely rigid in one location, as a star would be (and I ruled out any possibility of celestial object with my investigation). <P> I thought that maybe it could be a stationary satellite reflecting the sun, and so I would return on the next day and see if it was again visible. I returned again to the exact same spot at the exact same time the following day with the same weather and carefully scanned the same part of the sky, but absolutely nothing could be seen, ruling out a stationary satellite. See the photo below, taken at exactly the same position and time as the previous day, and compare with the photo above from the same spot that clearly shows the object:<P> Images at:  http://www.http://www.neilslade.com/UFOs.html   second half of page ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.  We have viewed the image for 17OC01, and believe that it is ambiguous, with regard to its being a photo of a genuine UFO.  It is an indistinct, small, white object against a blue sky.

Silver ball moving in Denver sky;2001-10-22 07:23:00;6 sec.;Silver ball moving in Denver sky It was a silver ball about a size of a tic-tac at arms length. The sphere was moving pretty slow, and it dissapeared after about 6 seconds. It was in the morning, but sunny. And there was very few clouds. The object was a perfect ball. And it was moving side-ways, and then it dissapeared... suddenly. There was only one ball. And it was silver, shiny and it looked like it was not reflecting off of the sun very much, but naturally it was that color. And about 4 seconds later I saw a plane, and I couldn't find the sphere like object.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Two unknown daylight lights observed high above Denver;2002-09-20 09:01:00;10 minutes;Two unknown daylight lights observed high above Denver While picking up mail at a downtown Denver post office I glanced up and saw two bright white oval lights high in the sky above Denver.  They were slightly to the west, about 5 to 7 degrees to the west and slightly south of the east-west axis of nearby Colfax Avenue. At first I thought they were planes but were not moving as planes would, almost stationary. I pointed out the high unknowns to a postal worker and two other regulars who pick up mail at the p.o. back door. Over the next few minutes we were busy receiving mail and kibitzing, but periodially looked up at the unknowns. One observer thought they were balloons.  Their height was undetermined but some observers saw a plane in the vicinity (no contrail) which seemed to disappear as it apparently lost an angle for reflecting its image from the sun in the east. Over the next few minutes the lights seemed to move closer together and more easterly (closer to being directly overhead, but still a few degrees to the west). At about 9:08 a.m. when we looked up one of the lights had disappeared and other was a few degrees more to the south. When we looked up around 9:10 a.m. the second bright circular light had disappeared. The FAA in Washington was contacted about 1 p.m. by me and I was referred to the Denver FAA office. The watch officer I was referred to said no one else had reported anything unusual ove Denver air space.  He was unaware of any balloon launches. (I had earlier contacted someone I know at the Weather Service and they said their balloons are launched hours earlier and expressed doubt the objects observed were theirs). The Weather Service said if their balloons pop the instruments descend by parachute.  No parachutes were observed after the bright lights dsappeared. The NUFORC was contacted (which the Washington FAA office had suggested as a second contact number) and I was asked if I knew of wind direction and force aloft over Denver at 0900 It was suggested the Denver FAA office would have that info.  I contacted the Denver FAA office a second time to try and obtain this information as it wuld help determine if the unknows were balloons - but my second transfer to the watch officer was answered by automatic voice mail. So I referred to my earlier call, apologized if I was being a nuisance, and asked for wind directions and force for three elevations above ground level and left my work number. As of 18:30 MST my call had not been returned.  (I now know more about what to ask for when initially contacting the FAA). This  sighting could have been the launch of two balloons by unknown researchers but until wind conditions are determined this sighting will be inconclusive.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
My husband and I observed an small bright red object flying over central Denver on a clear sky at dusk.;2004-05-04 20:55:00;8 minutes;My husband and I observed an small bright red object flying over central Denver on a clear sky at dusk. I noticed a small bright red light outside my north window. The light was round. At first I thought it was an airplain, but the light did not blink like an airplane. I was able to observe it until I was possitive it was not an airplane. It seemed to move slow then fast at about the altitude of small planes and helecoptors, in other words, not that high up. I yelled down to my husband to go outside to see if he could see it. He saw it. I ran outside, the object was swiftly moving dew north. We ran up the street so that we could still see it. We watched as it stayed in sight for a minute or so. It seemed to remain visible like it briefly stopped. Soon it became apparent that it was moving quickly away as it became so small, we could no longer see it.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Distant white spheres seen by crowd on college campus;2008-01-26 14:00:00;10 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We have elected to leave Mr. Romanek's name in this report, given that he has gone public about some of the dramatic sightings he appears to have experienced over recent years.  One of his sightings he captured on video, and we consider it to be a very interesting case.  PD))  Distant white spheres seen by crowd on college campus I was attending the Stan Romanek presentation at St Cajetan's Church on the Auraria Campus near downtown Denver. Shortly after 4:00 PM (4:15?) a break was called (the program ran from 2PM to 6PM). Many people, including me, went outside. It was a very nice day, mild (in the 40's), partly sunny, very light breeze. I just looked at the sky casually, but then I noticed a lot of people were looking and pointing and yelling about something in the sky. They were all looking north or northwest. I asked someone to point them out to me it took me about 30 seconds to notice them for myself. They appeared to be white. Most people said they looked like spheres (in fact, some said they were PERFECT spheres) but to me they looked more flattened, like a disc would look however, I wear glasses and my prescription is 4 years old and I know I don't have 20/20 vision with them anymore. A few people had cameras or cell phones with cameras and were trying to take pictures. I saw that one person has already posted their report and included 3 photos. They do look more rounded in the photos, so it was probably my eyesight that made them look more flattened somehow. A couple of people thought they were balloons, but I did not think so for 2 reasons. First, they did not drift together in the same direction like balloons would be if carried by the wind. They would change direction, go into and out of clouds, and move in opposite directions to one another and stop and hover, then move again. There were 3 or 4 initially, then only 2, then only 1. Then I went back inside because the program was to resume. Either the other objects took off so fast I couldn't see them, or they disappeared, or went behind a cloud or two. Stan was outside for a few minutes and also saw them but said it was hard to tell whether they were there for him and the crowd, or whether it was balloons or whatever he didn't watch them for long and went back inside. He asked the crowd later how many people saw the objects and a lot of hands wen! t up, pr obably more people saw them than didn't. Last summer at the UFO Watchtower, where Stan also was, there was a similar looking sighting--bright white color, very distant and high in the sky.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Two orbs,,,one in Denver,,,,one in San Diego;2009-01-04 05:30:00;5 to 7 minuets;Two orbs,,,one in Denver,,,,one in San Diego This is the second UFO I have observed in my life,,in this case I wake up at around 5:00 am and get ready for work,,affter getting dressed I step out on our deck to have a smoke. I allways look to the sky in the morning to see if theres weather,, and in hopes of catching another glimps of something. On this morning I noticed a bright sphere traveling east very high ( estimate ) upper atmosphere. Looked like a satelite untill it abrubtly stopped,,changed direction and traveled at an un-earthly speed in a northern direction,,stopped again for a few seconds proceeding east again. the speed at which this craft displayed was not of this earth,,nor was the way it manuvered. it continued to travel east for a few minuets,,and displaying that same un-earthly speed shot away from the earth,not straight up but at an angle which allowed me to see it it split second longer before it was gone. Trust me Humanity has nothing that can travel as fast as the craft I wittnessed. The first UFO I wittnessed was in San Diego. Over the Ocean Off of Point Loma about 2 miles away from shore. Clear nite about 9:00 or so,,,wittnessed a Green pulsing orb traveling eraticly north in a kind of floating up and down motion as it traveled north up the coast. It was fairly close, and was not like any conventional craft I have ever seen. Me and my girlfriend watched and affter about 8 to 10 minuets It left the earth close to straight up,,,,and at a speed that was close to the blink of an eye.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Glowing orange orb over south metro Denver.;2010-06-28 22:30:00;45 seconds;Glowing orange orb over south metro Denver. I was closing a window in my home when I saw a steadily glowing orange orb moving across the sky over my backyard. I went outside and observed the orb moving beneath cloud level at about the speed of a low flying airplane.  It did not blink, flash or change colors as it traveled from east to west. Size?  Maybe about the diameter of a teaspoon when held at arm's length when directly above me, growing smaller as it grew more distant.  I compared what I was seeing to several airplanes I could see in the sky at various distances and traveling in various directions.  Looked nothing like them.  Seemed to be moving too fast to be a hot air balloon.  Not enough wind tonight.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Several spheres over Denver - Visibile with polarizing glasses and invisible to normal glasses.;2011-06-28 11:40:00;5 minutes;Several spheres over Denver - Visible with polarizing glasses and invisible to normal glasses. While at the corner of N Speer Blvd and 14th, I noticed several white spheres floating in a circular pattern over the Western edge of Denver.  These appeared to be about half the size of a dime held at arm’s length.   One of the spheres was leaving this tight cluster and going out about the distance of 40 or so of the spheres.   There was a slight haze around the cluster, and a smaller haze around the individual object, but the spheres at the center were CLEARLY visible.   Confused as to what I was seeing, I removed my prescription sunglasses (which are polarized), and put on my non-polarized indoor prescription glasses.  With these glasses on, the objects were COMPLETELY invisible against the bright blue sky.   For nearly five minutes, I watched them with my sunglasses on, and during this time I tried to watch them several more times with my normal glasses.  The objects remained invisible to my non-polarized glasses.   After approximately five minutes, the objects began heading west towards the mountain at a fairly high rate of apparent speed.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

About two minutes later a commercial jet flew under it halfway between it and ground.  Another minute or so later another small white sphere quickly passed directly above the first sphere going from north to south.  Then clouds obscured it.   About 20 minutes later one other witness and I again saw two small white, spheres about one half mile east of us over Denver quickly going from north to south.  They were in unison, one slightly above and behind the other as they passed from view.  Their altitude was only a few hundred feet.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Transparent red balloon/bubble thing with lights. Had intelligence;2013-07-29 02:00:00;1.5 hours;Transparent red balloon/bubble thing with lights. Had intelligence I was driving down Colorado Blvd going back to my sisters house when out of the corner of my eye I saw something with lights hovering above the church on 38th. I did a u-turn on 40th and turned on 38th then stopped.  I recorded it on my sisters cell phone. While recording I noticed that the object was not showing up on the screen even though I was looking right at it.  I then stopped a guy that was walking and asked him if he saw it. He said ya you mean that square thing with the lights, it looks like a kite  It was NOT a kite. It was 2:30am. I then left and drove the short distance to my sisters.  I told her about it. When I told her it was still there when I left she wanted to go see if it was still there.  We drove back to that area and it was there hovering above the church.  We stopped on 38th and sat there bewildered as to what this object was.  My sister told me to drive under it. 02 Apprehensively I decided to drive down the alley just after the ! parking lot of the church.  As we maneuvered south down the alley the object hovered above but even with the car as it moved. When we reached 37th I turned left and stopped.  The object was hovering over 37th. As we were stopped a truck passed us and pulled over to see what we were looking at. They saw the object and thought it was peculiar.  They went about their business. My sister was trying to photograph the object (which we both concluded looked like a red transparent bubble with bluish white lights that seemed to be eyes.)   When the flash went off the object hovered/floated behind some trees as if it were trying to hide. I backed up down the street so we could see it.  I then decided to see if it would follow us and drove back up the street and it did indeed stay in close proximity to the car.  We parked in the church parking lot and got out. It was not threatening in anyway, just odd.  The two guys in the truck drove back by, saw us still looking and pulled into the parking lot.  The four of us could not determine what it ! was.  It did somewhat resemble a balloon so one of the guys tried to locate where a string was that would be tethering the object and was unsuccessful. Meanwhile my sister called her boyfriend and he showed up.  He too was baffled as to what this floating/hovering object could be.  The two guys in the truck left and my sister, her boyfriend and I just watched.  It seemed to be looking at us with the lights.  The lights moved as if it were thinking or computing.  I'm not sure of the correct word... It had intelligence.  By the time we left it was 4:00am and the object never went out of sight.  We left it, it didn't disappear.  During this time we also saw 2 what seemed to be stars go from standstill to across the sky.  It was like they took it out of park and moved quickly across the entire sky.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Just before midnight, after all firework shows had finished for the night..  Partly cloudy with high Cirrus clouds, partial moon..     3 orange globes, about the size of my pinky nail at arm's lenth..  Easily big enough to resolve with binoculars or other sighting device, but unfortunately, I didnt have one ready..     3 Objects came into view from the south and continued due North.   We were able to watch their entire track from almost horizon to horizon.  All 3 orange globes were following the same track, about 15 seconds behind each other, and completed the horizon to horizon track in less than 1 minute.   The objects were BELOW the cloud base (eliminates meteors), moving VERY fast, and made absolutely ZERO sound.  Fireworks would be an impossibility because of the duration, speed, and precision track of the objects. I am prior Air Force, so I have extensive experience in what night flight aircraft look and sound like, expecially on clear quiet nights..  My first instinct was that these were aircraft in full military power afterburners.  But again, there was NO sound, and afterburners are VERY loud, especially at that relatively low altitude.. There was one other witness to this event..      First time in my life I can't explain away something I've seen.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

The objects were as follows:  •8 perfectly spherical objects •Translucent with soft edges, unlike the defined edges of a balloon.  They appeared to have the exact same texture as the surrounding clouds. •6-12 ft in diameter and all the same size  •Appeared stationary, but possibly moving at low speed •Each maintained a distance of about 3x their own diameter from the next object  •Arranged in no particular order or on a particular plane;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
