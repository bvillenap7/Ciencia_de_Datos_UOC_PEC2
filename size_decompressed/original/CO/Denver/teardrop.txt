The motion made when in flight was tandem. Could have been Weather balloons except for the fact they where moving against the prevailing winds 25/30 mph winds that day I bet. Lasted only a few seconds untill they moved behind cloud cover. Same as brief summary.. there wasn't much to it other than the fact they where not aircraft. they looked like this (>-----<) and moved in tandem ( like when you would spin a dumbell) one side is always opposite the other. The main action that made me believe this thing was unusual was A. It's appearance B. it's movement against the Wind.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Driving down 285 west of Santa Fe, there was what appeared to be a bright planet or star in the sky off in the West.  Driving farther west, object began dropping slowly, (almost like a falling star) closer to the ground becoming brighter.   When crossing over Federal, I drove right under the object, it had a bright light and was flashing red on the sides. It was in the shape of an upside down teardrop with circles around the top.  Object disappeared after driving under it.   After the experience, I felt extremely uneasy and eyesight was affected right after.  Almost like I came across a very powerful energy.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
