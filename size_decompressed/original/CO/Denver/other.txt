Normal heavnly bodies do not travel in geometric patterns.;1974-09-11 20:00:00;5 min.;Normal heavnly bodies do not travel in geometric patterns. It was in n.e. Denver. I spotted a blank spot in the deep sky. Like dark matter, but only larger. In the shape of a tri-angel. Then at each corner at a time the craft stoped and left a light likened to a star. The the light went into the center. Where it stoped for a few minutes. It seemed to go straight up. Obviously at speeds faster than I can guess. When it dissapeared the three lights did also. The sky returned to normal. I could see the back ground stars, etc. I was looking south at about 75 degrees elevation. (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Brillant bright lights from the sky;1988-08-10 00:05:00;10 mins or so;Brillant bright lights from the sky I saw brilliant beams of light that illuminated the sky above & shot large circles of light on the ground below me. I was 31 yrs of age then I know the date because the event was so unexplainable to me that I wrote it all down in a notebook & have looked back at it several times over the years. It all started about midnite with a hit & run elsewhere that turned into a high-speed chase that ended across the street to the east, in Mr. K's backfield. My husband & I jumped out of bed to witness the truck crashing through the fence & numerous Denver & Englewood Police officers surrounding the truck as it came to a stop. Our bedroom is upstairs with a window facing to the South, we have a corner lot, and so we do see a lot that's going on most of the time. My husband was tired & after a few minutes of the usual police activity, we both went back to bed. He was out in a flash, which is normal I on the other hand just was lying there with my eyes shut thinking about the goings on.  Then an extremely bright flash of light lit the entire room, so much so I don't know how to explain this. Close your eyes & you see black, right, imagine that you see the whitest white. It causes me to sit right up in bed & look around real quick. I went back to the window & yes, police & everyone is still in the field. A tow truck is now waiting for his tow at the corner. Then the brilliant flashes of light begin. It lights up the so brightly, so fully more so than lightening but large circles of light beam to the ground, with such speed. It happened at least seven times in succession. Beams of light touched in the field behind the truck, on the south side of our garage, onto the garden, on the north side of the garage, onto the home to the north of us, then onto me and finally onto Mr K. & the tow driver walking back to the tow truck. No one below me acknowledges the light, no one look around or up. I ran to the window on the south side of the house, no lights. I ran back to the north window, no more lights, no helicopter noise,! no plan e noise. No lightening in the sky that day or night. I don't know what the lights were or where they came from, even was so shocked I even did the pinch test. I was awake I did see it. I decided after a few more minutes to lie back down, as I did I looked up at the alarm clock, it was 2 something in the morning. I lay there wondering where an hour & half of time went everything that happened wasn't more than 30 to 45 minutes of actual time. I may never know, but I do know that it happened, it was not a dream. I saw what I saw.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
I saw  a  UFO  in August of 1994.;1994-08-15 20:00:00;5 seconds;I saw  a  UFO  in August of 1994. I was in the penthouse of my apartment building at about 8pm.  The penthouse is maybe 15 stories up.  The object was at an altitude of approximately 170 feet.  It approached from the Northwest horizon heading Southeast.  It was in my sight for approximately two seconds.  This timeframe includes the approach.  It appeared to be a cluster of maybe four to five spherical quartz halogen type lights.  It was about the size of a small automobile.  There was no sound.  It was close enough to me and it went so fast that I should have felt a wind wake as it went by but I felt nothing.  I ran to the other side of the penthouse in hopes of seeing it disappear over the Southeast horizon but it was gone. This is all that I saw.  There are no other details.

Observed large, dark, vaguely boomerang-shaped object move swiftly and silently from NE to S and then arc W;1999-11-17 18:15:00;30-45 seconds;Observed large, dark, vaguely boomerang-shaped object move swiftly and silently from NE to S and then arc W My husband, my mother, and I were sitting on the porch of my parents downtown Denver home giving Jupiter it's first look through our brand new telescope. We had planned to drive out to the eastern Plains in a few hours to catch the peak of the Leonid meteor shower and wanted to get the scope ready to examine Saturn while in the darkness of the countryside. My husband was actually looking through the scope and my mother and I were standing up looking at the planet unaided when I saw movement in the sky just below and to the right of Jupiter. I looked and saw what appeared to be a very large, irregularly shaped object moving at an accelerated rate through the sky. Now when I say I saw it, I'm not sure that entirely describes how I witnessed it. This thing, whatever it was, was camouflaged exquisetely. To be perfectly honest, I don't know how it even caught my attention in the first place. It almost appeared to be a piece of the night sky itself. Immedeatly, I started screaming and pointing at the object as it glided silently almost entirely undetectable. I was screaming Oh my God, look! Look! Look! It's f---ing huge! What the f--- is that? My mother spotted it a half second later and began screaming as well. When my husband saw it he began saying it might be a military aircraft and to watch closely as it passed by the stars that were in it's path. The military theory was quickly extinguished when we saw light from the stars behind it pass through revealing that it was actually transluscent. We began to run to keep it in our sights but then lost it in the glare of streetlights. We were unable to re-establish visual contact with the phenomenon. We returned to the house and scrambled to call Buckley Air National Guard. The individual there procceded to remind us of the meteor shower and offered the number of the Denver Airfield. The person there was equally apathetic and offered us the number of NUFORC. All three of us  then drew pictures of the object independently without disscussing the details and ! came up with three remarkably similar shapes. The shape, like I've stated before, was an oddly irregular boomerang shape. I say boomerang for loss of any other descriptive word, for the object lacked the symmetry associated with a boomerang yet retained a decidedly boomerang shape. It appeared to be a slightly different texture than the sky which is probably the only reason it was visible at all. It's speed and apparent size were also immense.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
A triangle-shape object that looked like balls tied together, flying in formation.;1999-11-18 21:10:00;2 mins;A triangle-shape object that looked like balls tied together, flying in formation. My daughter and I were out in our backyard, looking for meteors, and noticed a wispy-looking thing approaching in the sky from the northwest. As it approached, it seemed to form a triangular formation. I remember thinking that it looked like geese, but realized it was a string of glowing balls. The balls were golden/white in color, looking like dimmed light bulbs, and the formation appeared to be, perhaps, balloons tied together. My daughter and I figured that's what it was, catching the reflection of the moon, but as it went over our yard, we realized that balloons could not hold the triangular shape we were seeing. Also, the breeze was coming from the west and this formation was travelling north to south at approximately 25-30 mph. It made no noise whatever. It was very large. I have no way to determine the altitude, as it was dark outside, but I could clearly see that the individual balls were round in shape. The formation continued due south and then appeared to veer southwest as we lost sight of it. I called a friend who lived in that direction and asked her to look for it, but she didn't see anything. We were surprised to not hear anything on the news about it or read about it this morning in the paper. We are both sane females and as we discussed the event, as it was occuring, there is no doubt that we both saw the same thing at the same time.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Daytime black wing-like configuration flying low and at rapid speed over Denver;2002-01-13 14:30:00;5 seconds;Daytime black wing-like configuration flying low and at rapid speed over Denver It was a mostly sunny, breezy, warm day.  My teenaged daughter and I were in our car, just about a block away from my house, when from the top part of my windshield I saw a very rapid West to East (right to left) flyover of something I could not identify.  I ducked but they had passed over some trees and I yelled to my daughter to look to the left, as the object came through a clearing.  Whatever it was, it had seemingly transformed from two closely-spaced but possibly separate black Vs (almost like birds flying closely together) into one slightly tilted black line with 4 distinct, shallow Vs connected to a straight black line making up what appeared to be a wing configuration (no fuselage seen, i.e. it appeared to be a horizontal line while flying away from us).  It was flying at tremendous speed -- much faster than any small aircraft would.  During the lapse of 1 or 2 seconds between my first seeing it out the windshield to seeing in a different shape (different perspective?) from my driver's side window, it was by then probably about a half mile away and flying at no more than a mile in altitude, yet still about a full inch from side to side at arm's length.  Therefore, it was good-sized, yet did not appear to be any kind of typical aircraft -- and not two very fast-flying birds which was what my split-second initial view of it had reminded me of.   My daughter was also amazed and said, Mom, follow it!  Turn up here and let's chase it!  By the time we got to the end of the block, I turned, but with buildings and trees obscuring our view, we never caught sight of it again.  I rolled down my window, expecting to hear some kind of sound, but didn't hear anything.  I would say it was definitely unidentified, low flying, and large, with a totally unique shape, and my daughter thinks it was a military aircraft.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

I went out on my deck, and above my house was a large craft, spinning extremely fast. It was very fast, and there were four jets-I supposed that they were Air Forsce jets escorting it or watching it. It moved towards the north east, spinning quickly the entire time, and closely sttended by the jets, until it dipped out of my line of sight, either going down or landing.  I ran inside, discussed it with my husband, while flipping channels on the TV, expecting to hear a news report. This was a Saturday night, warm weather, and I was incredulous that we were the only people who had seen it.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Triangle like object appears, lands then dissapears near littleton hospital;2006-10-07 02:00:00;15 to 20 minutes;Triangle like object appears, lands then dissapears near littleton hospital My friends and I were out for a drive in the South Broadway/Hampton area when all of a sudden we saw what appeared to be two planes flying extremley low to the ground. Upon further inspection, we noticed that the planes were connected to eachother by a beam of light, and that what we had thought to be the triad pattern of lights often seen on planes at night was acutally a part of this strange object. The best possible description of its appearence is that it was one larger triangular shape lined with red and blue lights connected to a similar but smaller triangular shape. It moved very fast and sparatically making no noise at all. It was able to turn very sharply. The larger and smaller triangular components of the object always moved relative to eachother, maintaining a perfect connection.  After aproximatley two minutes of what appeared to be random motion, the object suddenly flew away into the distance until it was no longer visible. At this point, my friends and I were positive that what we saw was not a plane/helicopter/weather ballon due to the apparent high velocity the object was able to reach in such a short amount of time, and the complexity of its movement. My emotions at this time were shock, excitement, and amazement of what I had just seen. After the object had been gone for about 6 minutes, it suddenly reappeared very close to us, approximatly 50 yards above our car. After flying around the area for for about a minute, the object came to an abrupt stop above a residential area, about four blocks away from our car. At this point, we stopped the car and I was able to get a better look at the object. The light beam connection was actually a very well lit solid connection and dark window shapes could be made out on the smaller of the two triangles. I glanced down the street and noticed that several other cars had stopped to observe the object as well. After it hovered for a few seconds, it began to descend and landed on the ground. We immediatley tried to drive to where ! it had l anded, but could not find anything. The object had apparently dissapeared or become invisible upon landing. We searced the area where it appeared to have landed intensly for about a half and hour but could find nothing. Three helicopters arrived and appeared to be activley searching during the this time, and for the remainder of the night we could see/hear helicopters near the area of the sighting. Throughout the entire sighting I never felt afraid, I just felt amazed beyond belief and lucky to have seen this object.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Me and my best friend went outside on my front porch (which faces east) to have a cigarette. He noticed an odd, bright light hovering in the sky. At first we thought it was just a planet or an exceptionally bright star, but it began blinking red, green and white lights. After about 20 minutes of watching, it began to move around in zigzag and circular patterns.  As it moved around and came closer, we were able to discern the object was crescent shaped. It alternated between moving at a regular, steady pace and quickly darting around.  We are two college students, both majoring in social sciences (I am an anthropology major, and he is a psychology major). We both pride ourselves on being highly rational. After discussing it in depth, we could find no logical explanation for what this object was other than a UFO.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Black and shiny object flying over Denver CO;2011-06-11 17:35:00;1-2 minutes;Black and shiny object flying over Denver CO I was sitting at my desk playing around on the computer with the blinds open.  My window faces out to the East and I have a pretty good view of the sky from where my desk is at my house.   I saw something black and shiny heading towards my house about 6-9 thousand feet up.  Lower than your usual aircraft coming in to land at DIA.  As it flew closer, I could see it tumbling over itself repeatedly and thought maybe it was a balloon at first.  But as it approached closer, I could see the sun reflecting off it very brightly and could easily tell that it wasn’t a balloon.  It started to get a little larger as it came closer and I ran outside to get a better look.  I am so glad I did that because what I saw next confirmed what I was hoping for all along. As I stood on my porch, I was able to see this thing pretty well at that point.  It was very black and shiny and was shape-shifting from a star-like object, into a triangle object and then into something I cannot even describe on any level.  But it changed shapes as it continued to tumble over itself.  But every time it tumbled, you could see something different going on, almost as if it needed to tumble in order to accomplish a particular task.  I don’t know…that’s the best way I can describe it I guess. At any rate, after watching this for 1-2 minutes, I watched it for as far as I could before it flew completely out of sight.  However, someone from downtown Denver should have been able to capture this thing well depending on his or her location.  It was heading towards the news stations so they should have been able to see this thing too. I hope someone reports it besides me.  Oh yeah, the camera on my phone wouldn’t have captured it as my phone is almost 4 years old.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Orb over Denver tonight was a helium balloon;2012-08-18 18:50:00;08 minutes;Orb over Denver tonight was a helium balloon Hello Peter and center volunteers/researchers.   I'm a UFO hound and I wanted to dispel any possible false identifications this evening.   I was at a birthday party in SE Denver (roughly Iliff Ave and Colorado Blvd)with probably 25 attendees.  My children were playing with a bouquet of balloons and a large (probably 15 x 4) cylindrical helium filled balloon broke free and rapidly began to ascend.  People see a lot of orbs and spheres and this is one that we can effectively rule as identified..  I wanted to file a report out of respect for the purity and importance of the research that you do.  I think it's very possible that you might receive some sightings because of the balloon's startling altitude which I'm guessing was at least 1,500 feet.  The balloon traveled in a pure westerly direction at 5-10mph. ((NUFORC Note:  No reports, yet, but we are grateful to the source of this report for sharing the information.

Unidentified box looking object flying across Denver Metropolitan area under intelligent control.;2012-10-13 14:38:00;15 minutes;Unidentified box looking object flying across Denver Metropolitan area under intelligent control. I was northbound on Colorado Blvd (aka State Hwy Colorado 2) going to work in Commerce City when I first saw the object about 500 feet high maybe 1/4 of a mile away.  I was able to get off the road at 52nd and get out of my car and just watch it.  I saw what looked like a big black wall....flying.  When reality hit me and I remembered there's nothing aerodynamic about a wall I just stared at the thing all the time looking for a witness, but there was no traffic on an ordinarily busy street.  Finally a young Hispanic girl with braces came along but was late to work and I couldn't even get her to look at the object.  It continued flying in a southeasterly direction and about 15 minutes later out of sight.  Important to note that it flew across Interstate 70 approaching Interstate 270 at right around 2:40PM and anybody looking up should have seen it.  The most disturbing thing is I had a good cellphone with a decent camera but I didn't even think about it and i! t remained in it's holster.  As I was watching it from behind there was at least one column like looking thing attached to the rear so ultimately I would say it was like a flying box with a propulsion mechanism attached.  It also appeared to fly over Interstate 225 a few minutes later and not far from Buckley AFB.  No noise heard during the entire encounter and as close as it was, there should have been something.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

My street is caddy-wampus, so the front faces north and east.  And if you look polar north, neighboring trees block the horizontal view.   Well as soon we backed into our driveway, we all took notice to a strange grouping of orbs all glowing orange traveling in the night sky.  We noticed they had a vertical trajectory, and one right after another they came up in the northern hemisphere as something that raised up into plain view, and came to stop at the same point in the sky, pulsated for a moment than vanished.  We seen 3 objects one right after another within a 5-10min span of time do this.  We though that was it, than 2 came up side by side with how manyever feet of distance between them, could've been a couple of miles could have been more. Same song same dance.  Amazing!

As I was staring out my window, there was a strange orange light coming towards me.  It looked somewhat neon, but softer.  The light was vibrating rapidly at frequencies I've never seen in any man-made aircraft.   As it approached, I could see 3 different colored rockets attached on the bottom and a gray/white roof on top.  The top was sort of triangular and the bottom had 3 rockets that were cone-shaped with flames of light coming off of them.  One of the rockets flames was orange/yellowish, one was blue, and one was red. It seemed like it was vibrating instead of being propelled by an engine.   It flew about 20 feet above my window and very close to the roof of my 10-story building.  It happened very fast.  The vibration of the aircraft was so fast that taking a picture would most likely have resulted in an image of an extremely blurry light.  Although it was vibrating so fast, it seemed like it had slowed down to observe the area for some reason.   This was in Capitol Hill.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

This sighting was July 28, 2015.  I was lying on the sidewalk in front of my house admiring the sunset, which is something I often do.  I noticed a black, medicine-capsule shaped object flying overhead from East to West.   At first, I thought that it was just a balloon, but as I watched it, I changed my mind.  I have seen many balloons flying, as most people have.  All that I have seen go primarily upwards, and also usually move somewhat horizontally.  They usually tend to wiggle a bit and wobble as they fly.   This object did not appear to rise upwards at all.  It seemed to maintain a completely horizontal movement, and apparently moved in a straight line toward the west.  It did not wiggle or wobble at all as a small balloon would.  It made no noise at all.   I was able to watch it for a minute or two, until it traveled so far into the distance that I couldn't see it anymore.  I wasn’t really sure about the size of it, but I recently saw a helicopter in the sky at about the same location in the sky, and about the same time in the evening.  The helicopter appeared to be about the same size as the object I saw, as well as about the same altitude, and seemed to move at about the same speed.   The thing that I saw was certainly not a helicopter, as it clearly capsule-shaped, as I mentioned, and made not noise at all.   I saw something similar about two weeks earlier, that was moving the opposite direction, from West to East, at about the same time of evening.  I ran into the house to get binoculars, but it was gone when I returned.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Before my eyes the craft went from a star-shaped object, to a cigar shape, but it also looked like it had hooked wings.   After about 3 minutes the craft took the shape of a star again, turned bright red and vanished.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Strange colored lights blinking and moving erratically in south Denver sky.;2017-09-07 23:00:00;1 minute;Strange colored lights blinking and moving erratically in south Denver sky. I first noticed 2 distinctive lights.  one red and one green.  The red light was in the upper left and the green light was to the bottom right.   The lights were solid, then they began to blink.  Both started blinking in a pattern that was frequent in wavelength like that of a plane, but then they started blinking independently instead of at the same time.  Then the green light went out and the red light started moving up and down erratically and very precisely.   Then the green light came back on and blinked very erratically and the red went off.  It then flew overhead at incredible speed from the north sky to the south sky and descended out of view.  When it flew overhead, it was pure silence.   My friend who also saw it accounts that he saw blue and white lights too.  He was certain he saw them, but I am certain I did not.  We both watched very intently.  No craft was actually seen, only two lights.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Six objects changing formation for about 10 minutes above the Denver Metro Area, mid day.;2019-05-24 12:30:00;10-12 minutes;six objects changing formation for about 10 minutes above the Denver Metro Area, mid day. May 24, 2019, Appox. 12:30pm  1 Mile west of downtown Denver, Colorado, (32nd Ave & King Street)   	Today, May 24, 2019, about a mile due west of Denver Colorado.  It is a day with almost no clouds and bright sunshine.  I was standing outside talking with my neighbors when I noticed 6 objects to the NNE.  The objects were at a 50-60 degree angle from my location.  These objects were simply just there.  From my location they had the appearance of an object between a baseball and a golf ball.  Planes were passing over headed to the local airport, Denver International Airport that fly at approx. 12,000’, less than a mile above the ground, as they have just passed over 12-14,000’ foot mountains and begin decent for landing.  A private plane passed over at no more than 2000’ feet above so my guess is they were 3-4000’ above the ground. 	My first thought is that these were balloons that had been released, as today is the last day of school.  The objects would have been too large to be balloons and they stayed in the same relative altitude.  Next, I thought they might be birds as they were constantly changing formations.  The idea being they were trying to gain altitude.  They moved from V to diamond to non-formation and back in a constant shifting of their position relative to each other. 	This was not birds or balloons.  First, their size would have been too big for a bird and while I thought I saw a wing, given the size of a bird and distance it was away a wing would not be possible to see.  Even White Trumpeter Swans would be smaller, they are exceedingly rare in this part of the US and don’t fly in the manner that I witnessed.  They also reflected light of a white translucent color with a hint of rainbow sheen leaning heavier towards the red spectrum.  Birds don’t reflect light, which is why my mind first turned to balloons, but again the size was too large.  They had to be rather large in size . They appeared to be flying in an erratic behavior at first glance, much like balloons, but it soon became apparent these were flying in a controlled manner and altering between multiple formations. I was with two neighbors who took no interest, and I’m not sure if they could see them.  I was wearing sunglasses and when I removed my glasses, I was unable to see the objects. They were not wearing any sunglasses (and chuckled at my reference to the objects being extraordinary).  My I-Phone was unable to pick up anything either.  The objects were clearly reflecting light which changed as they moved, giving the impression they were possibly spinning.  The reflecting was not bright enough to overcome the sun’s glare without sunglasses. This went on for about 10 minutes.  I turned my eyes away for a moment and when looked back they were simply gone.  I waited about 30-45 minutes to gather my thoughts and then began this reporting process.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

I am a farmer. I seen in the distance over the 25highway heading north. At first a massive cube shaped object in the sky. I didn't understand what it was and tryed to take a picture. The craft was so far I was only able to catch a glimpsed picture. I watched it for 20 minutes on the phone with my girlfriend. It moved very slowly following the path of interstate 25. After about 10 minutes. I was watching it directly gazing at how awesome it looked. A second one appears out of thin air next to the craft but at a considerable distance. They did not interact with one another but moved in the same pathway along the highway. This second craft was noticibily smaller. The crafts were cube shaped and casted a shadow on the hillside. They had distinct edges giving shape to a cube. I could see the shadows being created on its surface. It was very far away from me but I could see the lighting on its surface. It stayed at the Same elevation. I thought it was a helicopter or hot air balloon. If it was a hot air balloon it was all black and the first time I had ever seen an all black airballoon.this craft was massive and not afraid of people seeing it. I could not have been the only person to see this massive cube hovering above our highway. I watched it all the way from one site to the next roughly 20 minutes and it loved strategic and parallel to our highway 25. Needs investigated. What was that? I was not under any influence of drugs or alcohol. I was of right mind and could make wholeful judgement. I have never seen anything like this in my life. It stopped me in my tracks and all I could do is look at this massive object in awe.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
