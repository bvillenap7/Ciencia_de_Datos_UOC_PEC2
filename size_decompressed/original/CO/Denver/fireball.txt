Red fireball with red tail traveling east to west;1998-10-06 19:05:00;1-2 secs.;Red fireball with red tail traveling east to west As I was passing through the intersection of Santa Fe and Mississippi going south, I happened to see a red fireball-like object that seemed to descend from left to right (east to west) at a 45-degree angle, then zip westward quickly and disappeared behind trees in my view.  I attempted to follow its path with my eyes on the other side of the trees, only a brief distance, especially at the rate at which the object seemed to be traveling, but did not see any trace.  The light seemed to be quite far away, perhaps 2-5 miles directly south of my view, at about 45 degrees above the horizon from my vantage point.  Its size appeared to be larger than the brightest star, but not much bigger.  The narrow tail appeared briefly as it was visible before the trees, but disappeared almost instantly.  I thought about what it may have been, as I was incredulous, never having had a sighting in the Denver area. I thought about it being possibly a reflection of tail lights in my windshield, but I was traveling on a one-way street on one side of a river (the other direction is on the other side of the South Platte River, and is not visible much of the time from my side of the road) after having passed through an intersection where a traffic light halted any perpendicular traffic.  Additionally, the light had just turned green and I was one of the first cars to pass through the inter- section.  Finally, I have traveled this route many, many times before, and had never seen anything of this sort.  One more thing, there may have been light clouds that evening, but I do not specifically recall (sorry).  The sun was well-down by this time--not dusk at all. As mentioned above, I had never seen a sighting in the Denver area, but have had 2 separate sightings in the Caribbean in February of this year. I am a 33-year-old female computer programmer and UFO enthusiast, having grown up in northeastern Colorado, watching programs about such things, but have never, until recently, seen anything I would consider a UFO.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Headed northeast on a downward angle. Spotted at I-25 & I-225 interchange. Must have touched/crashed, but no explosion. Reported all over the radio this morning. Bright aqua green flashing roundish ball with orange sparkles coming out the back in a triangular shape, may have had a red dot near the back, but can't be sure. Headed northeast on a downward (45 degree?) angle. Spotted at I-25 & I-225 interchange. Must have touched/crashed, but no explosion. Reported all over the radio this morning. The orange sparkles (flames?) were not showering down, the aqua ball wash flashing/strobing like a huge flare gun round would. Dropped down behind the buildings and out of sight.  People have reported this as far away as Fort Collins, CO...so, it couldn't have been as close to me as expected. I thought I would see some fire, light, or explosion when it crashed, that didn't happen.  But, I nearly drove off the highway, along with many other cars on the road. I didn't know who to call (neither did my husband when I got home).;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Two different color orbs playing chase over denver & shortly after military aircraft shows up.;2001-08-20 13:00:00;3 min.;Two different color orbs playing chase over denver & shortly after military aircraft shows up. The second witness and I were sitting on a trampoline in the back yard looking up at the sky and as a single small cloud passed overhead two balls of fire or orbs one bluish white and the other reddish orange came down under the cloud and then played chase over and under and threw the cloud emitting bright lights that could be seen threw the cloud even during the day, they played for no more than two or three minutes and shot straight up in the sky disappearing. No more that 5 minutes went buy and two F-18 jets came screaming out of the east directly threw the cloud where the balls of fire where just playing giving me the chilling Idea we were not the only ones who seen the flying orbs. My then girl friend ran in the house terrified & I fallowed feeling the same fascinating fear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
2 Fireballs (green metal front rest on fire ) Sunday  East to West Monday North to South (live video;2002-10-06 19:30:00;caught on film;2 Fireballs (green metal front rest on fire ) Sunday  East to West Monday North to South (live video Wed Oct 8th/2002 Central City, Colorado After listening to the local Denver news tonight, they mentioned the a hugh fireball in the sky Sunday night at 7:30pm flying East to West, on Monday same time flying North to South, (Pikes Peak) tonight they showed a video from viewer, WOW, I have never seen anything that huge before, at first news told us it was an astro, but tonight they say they don't know what it is after trying to zoom in on the object to see what it is and they don't know what it is, and it has been seen in several others states as well. Channel 2 is the news TV station I saw this report on.  Just thought you would like to know this, I think this should be pursude, 2 nights in a row, are they starting to make their presence? It is huge looks green in from and on fire on the back of it. The video is great and their were many witnesses, they thought a plane had blew up, Norad in Boulder said it was an Astro, and now they don't know what it is. It's just interesting to me that is has flown 2 different directions Sunday Oct 6th and Monday Oct 7th. In other states if I remember correctly NM, WY, NV UT, it's on the news report, you got to get your hands on this video and it checked to see if you can tell what is really was. Please keep me informed, I am an ufologist (small time) but very opened minded, just would like to know what was happening and what was it?;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

A flash of light hovering over a lake.;2006-01-03 23:55:00;2 min;A flash of light hovering over a lake. We were walking around Sloans Lake when a large flash of light appeared briefly over the lake. It was about 2 meters in diameter and hovered 6 meters over the lake. It was mostly red in color but there were some yellows and oranges. We dont know if there were any other witnesses. We looked for emergency vehicles and other cars that may have been in distress, but saw nothing. There was also a definate change in temperature. It was about 46 degrees when we returned home and I would have to hazzard a guess that the temperature jumped up to 60 or 70 degrees. We're still not sure what we saw, but it definately fit the description of a UFO.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Light objects appearing over North Denver in a triangle formation.;2013-09-23 20:45:00;10 minutes;light objects appearing over North Denver in a triangle formation My husband and I seen 3 light objects above North Denver.  In a triangle formation, At first it looked like a fire work but it was standing still in mid air for awhile. The bottom right object was fading away and reappeared east of the formation. Then quickly moving side to side. It kind looked like it had tail at the end of the object. It quickly moved back to its original spot in the triangle formation. There was a helicopter flying around the object and soon there were several after the three objects disappeared.  That’s how low the objects were to the ground. We could visually see the helicopters. Took a picture of it with phone and will send it in. Looked on net for others who might have seen it with no luck. Also there was a car that lost power near our intersection, they thought they ran out of gas, put gas in and that didn’t work. The car did manage to start after awhile. And our car that was parked outside, lights did not seem to be working but work! ed afterward. Weird stuff. First time we ever experienced something like this.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367

Intelligent burning fireball over University Hills/ Denver, CO.;2015-01-01 19:50:00;5 minutes;Intelligent burning fireball over University Hills/ Denver, CO My boyfriend and I were leaving to go to dinner when we both saw something strange in the sky just above my neighborhood in university hills.  It looked like something burning and on fire, which alarmed us at first.  We could tell it wasn't a plane or anything with a constant beam of light because there was a center light that was bright and the flickering fire-like light was moving up from the lower ball of light, just as flames move up and lick the air.   The object wasn't flying as high up as commercial airplanes fly, but more around the height a helicopter would hover.  It was on a constant path moving from west to east at a constant speed when it stopped suddenly for about a minute it just hovered there and kept burning.  Then it started moving again at a slower speed moving south, also appearing to gain height in altitude as well.  We could see the light grow faint but could no longer see the burning.  At this point we were viewing the object thro! ugh the trees and watched it change course again heading slightly diagonal towards south east.   Just as fast as it had appeared out of nowhere, it began moving up in altitude very quickly until it was just a faint light, almost as if it was a star, despite the snow that was falling and the fact that no stars were visible.   I took a video that captures the main chunk of the sighting but my phone died just after it began gaining altitude and disappeared.   The fact the object was burning was alarming enough, but the intelligent speed and direction changes were enough to convince us this was something foreign and extraterrestrial.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
