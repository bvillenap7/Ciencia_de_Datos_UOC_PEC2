Something(s) rising behind me as I was driving home from work.;1999-11-12 19:00:00;1-2 mins.;Something(s) rising behind me as I was driving home from work. Within 2 miles from home driving back from work on Florida Avenue, I noticed in my rearview mirror a bright white rectangular light about the intensity of a street lamp at a distance of 50 feet directly to the east.  It appeared to be rising over Ruby Hill Park directly behind me. I say rising because I was descending the hill and it appeared to peek up over the crest of the hill directly behind me in line with the street as I continued away from it.  It could not have been a car, however, as it continued to appear to rise above the level of the street even at the top of the hill, though that thought initially crossed my mind.  I had never noticed such a light at that location behind me, but thought perhaps I had just been inattentive previously not to notice. As I continued, two more appeared to rise above the hill flanking the first one so they appeared to be in a triangular formation behind the first one from my vantage point.  Since they had the brightness of a street lamp, I thought that was what they were.  However, the street lamps at distances much nearer faded from view due to their lack of strength and the edges that direct the light downward as I drove away from them.  I also thought they could be lights on top of tall buildings that were there and I had never noticed, or were being built, but the direction I was viewing has no such construction taking place, nor does it have any tall buildings. I pulled into a filling station to get gas, then thought I would try to look for them again later that evening, as I had plans to go out with some friends.  However, I was in the back seat and did not think to look for them the rest of that night.  The next night, though, I looked for them and they were not there!  Additionally, the part of the city I could normally see was occluded while those lights were there.  This would lead me to believe that the 3 lights were not just separate lights, but were actually part of one large craft.  But I really have no idea what they or it was.  I have just not seen it since. A few more facts:  the rising action stopped and the object(s) seemed to be stationary once I saw all three.  The rising action could have even been an illusion because the land begins to rise a mile or so west of Ruby Hill.  I might note, however, that I was only about a quarter of a mile beyond the hill when I started to notice the first one.  They were not following me, nor were they moving in any direction like a plane or jet.  The light quality seemed to be gas lights of some sort, but much brighter proportionately.  The object(s) were probably a distance of 4 to 10 miles, depending on how big they really were.  I don't know why I was so casual about the whole thing, but I just felt it was an interesting phenomenon.  I had had three previous sightings which were much more interesting.  One of them was chronicled here about a year ago.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Large white rectangular UFO over Denver;2007-08-21 09:55:00;60 to 90 seconds;Large white rectangular UFO over Denver I was driving north on Santa Fe Drive.  I noticed a large white rectangular object about 5 degrees higher than the highest buildings of downtown.  It looked like a large playing card.  At first I thought it might be a large banner being pulled behind a plane.  But the object was immense, at least 300 feet by 200 feet.  I looked for a tow plane but could see none.  Plus such a large object could not be towed behind a prop plane.  As I watched it slowly moved in an arc.  It seemed to be turning to the left from my perspective.  As it travelled in the arc, it seems to shrink in size, as if you were to take a playing card and slowly turn the flat edge perpendicular to youself.  As it reached the edge, it simply disappeared.  I kept watching for it to turn again but it never did.  It was simply gone.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Stealthy object enters atmosphere, conducts surveillance of Denver and Arapahoe counties in Colorado;2007-10-04 21:10:00;10 seconds;Stealthy object enters atmosphere, conducts surveillance of Denver and Arapahoe counties in Colorado UFO sighting by a non-believer!  Date:   10/04/07 (Thursday)  Time:   About 9:10-9:15 p.m. MST  Location:   Denver/Aurora Colorado USA Parking lot of the Stampede Dance Club, on the border of the cities of Denver and Aurora in Colorado   Two Strange Phenomena   I.  Apparent micrometeoroid flash  1)	I went outside the club around 9:10 p.m. tonight to get some air, and walked to a dark area near the end of a parking lot between some trees. At about 50 degrees SE of the zenith there was a bright cloud over Parker, CO, at a height of about 10,000-15,000 feet.  It was oblong and extended down to the horizon.  Otherwise the seeing was great overhead with a dark and crisp sky (usual for autumn in Colorado). 2)  	I looked up and found Cygnus (extending about 0-30 degrees southeast of the zenith), then over to the west to find Lyra (normal sky gazing for me), then back at Cygnus, and then slightly to the east. 3)  	A very faint micrometeoroid flash occurred in Lyra.  What struck me was that it was extremely faint, so short (less than 2 moon widths) and that it had a slight “j” hook to the east. This was at about 10-20 degrees SSW of the zenith. 4)  	Total sightig--about 1 second.  II. UFO  1)  	Following the trajectory of the micrometeoroid flash (contrail?), within  a second or so and starting about 10 degrees due south, I saw an object moving across the star field at an apparent high altitude, squareish, with a cluster of lights centrally located within the square (perhaps a violet and a white light, extremely faint, and perhaps 1-2 others). 2)  	The object at first moved generally east toward Cygnus, shifting erratically back and forth at 90 degrees, while jumping erratically 5+ degrees north and south, instantaneously. 3)  	The object appeared to maintain the same altitude throughout the sighting, and was less than ¼ of a moon width. It finally disappeared to the SE into the glare of the cloud over Parker, and I waited to see if it appeared under the cloud--it didn’t. 4)  	Total sighting- about 7 seconds.  III. Personal notes  1)	I’ve been a sky gazing hobbyist for over 45 years (I’m 54 now), and I know what to look for in the constellations. 2)	I’m a veteran of seven archaeological projects including a survey, and am used to looking quickly for unusual detail (20:13 vision). 3)	Except for some inconsistencies with the Nasca features and the nearby hill theory, or an occasional mutilation that goes against the predator theory, I’m afraid I’m pretty much a “Skeptical Inquirer” type.  Crop circles are all pranks, etc.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
Sighting of unknown rectangle craft,;2020-11-02 09:40:00;5 seconds;Sighting of unknown rectangle craft, On November 2nd I’m outside having a smoke at 9:30am, on the west side of my apartment complex.   I’m sitting by an area for smoking, on north side looking south. Weather cool and no cloud cover at all.  At about 9:40am, I hear what sounds like a small business jet.  This is normal for this area.  When I look up I see something, a craft shaped like a dollar bill.  This shape is similar to Northrop Tacit Blue, but at this point things are different.  At midpoint on each side of the fuselage there appears to be wings, they are too short and straight out from body of craft to be of little use.  There is also no tail structure, is completely missing on the craft.  Finally there is what looks like some kind of exhaust port on end of craft. Also craft wasn’t too thick in cross section.  The object was on a bearing of about 165° true.  The view was about   five seconds, then view was blocked a wood horizontal beam and it was never seen.  Its bear could of change to the west.;39.7388117431815;-104.985074484367
