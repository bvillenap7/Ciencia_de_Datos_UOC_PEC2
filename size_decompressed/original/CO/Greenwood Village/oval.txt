I seen four white round objects;2008-07-06 01:35:00;10 minutes;I was turning left from Quebec to Orchard facing south.  While waiting at the light, I looked up at the clouds because it was about to rain and the clouds were a dark black. At about one oclock in the sky I seen four white round objects just be low a dark cloud. At first they where not moving, then two of them started moving in a wave form side by side. Then the other two joined in moving in the same patern.   The light changed and I had to turn.  By the time I got home they where no longer there...did anyone else see this?;39.6115720930233;-104.914893023256
