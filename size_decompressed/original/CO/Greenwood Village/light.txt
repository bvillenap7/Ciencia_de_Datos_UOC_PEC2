Blue ball of light with svrl  trails shot across the sky;2006-03-24 21:30:00;15 sec;Blue ball of light with svrl  trails shot across the sky I was hanging out with friends in the kitchen. I walked outside to get some air and check out the sky. This fast moving Blue ball flew over going southwest. It had several trails behind it as it went over. It was exciting. Wonder if it was a comet or what?;39.6115720930233;-104.914893023256
White fireball of light with a tail, like a meteor, flying low over Denver before disappearing.  ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??  PD));2015-03-11 06:00:00;3-5 seconds;White fireball of light with a tail, like a meteor, flying low over Denver before disappearing I was on my morning commute, heading north on I-25 to the Denver Tech Center, when I saw a low-flying white ball of light cross Interstate 25 around 6 a.m.   As it passed directly in front of my field of vision flying east to west, it appeared to be trailing a tail, making it resemble a comet or meteor right out of a sci-fi disaster movie.   It flew at a rate faster than a helicopter toward the west before disappearing. ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??  Please see other report of apparently the same event.  PD));39.6115720930233;-104.914893023256
