Flying triangle in Bayfield, CO;2003-10-02 21:00:00;5 min;Flying triangle in Bayfield, CO Okay, this is kind of cheesy beacuse I didnt actually see the thing my father did, but there is no doubt in my mind that he really did.  We live in a very small town, and my father had to dive my mother to a hospital in nearby Durango.  On his return he pulled to the side of the road to observe a triangular craft with blinking red and blue lights underneath, and making no sound as it passed closely over his car.  My father would never lie to me, especially on such a dramatic night, with my mother's condition and all.  So why am I, a non-witness telling you this ten months after the fact?  I actually forgot about what he told me until I was watching some show on TV about aliens and they showed a triangular craft, reminding me.  I went on the internet to research it and came across this site.  Thought I would go ahead and report the sighting for him, because my dad would never do such a thing, and I just thought it might be helpful.;37.261;-107.6068
