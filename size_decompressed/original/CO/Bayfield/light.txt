Large light object in sky with lightning storm and huge beam of light from below in  southern Colorado;1998-10-01 05:30:00;30 minutes;Large light object in sky with lightning storm and huge beam of light from below in  southern Colorado At 5:30 AM We whitnissed a huge flat oval shape of light estimated to be thirty miles across. We were about twenty miles south and watched it hang approximatly 2000 yards up, off the ground. It had a large white beam of light coming down out of it and spoted on the ground. It appeared to create its own storm of wild weather with lightning blasting off the top and in a very hard wind from west to east the lightning spilled away from the object off the east.The sky was very cloudy but had low clear cieling and the object was just above thecloud layer.  The intensity of the light seemed to throb bigger and smaller. This all happened the morning of October 1st,1998.I later made notes and a sketch. I am a commercial artist from dallas texas. I have only now come across this web site or I would have reported sooner. I saw this from a camp site I was in located in Northern, New Mexico. After seeing this thing later that morning I looked at the map to see where it could have been. I called the police station in Bayfield colorado as it seemed that was where it occured. I spoke with an officer an after a brief discription and query as to has anyone else called in  he stopped me and described the same thing only he said he was in his patrol car underneath it, He was just outside the town of bayfield. I later called the airprot control tower in Durang as I thought certain ly they had it on radar. It was huge. They said nothing. Istayed in touch with the officer but not much ahs come of it. My question to you is did anyone else see this or do you have any other reports from that day and location??;37.261;-107.6068
