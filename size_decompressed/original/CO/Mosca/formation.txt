In Pinon Flats in Great Sand Dunes.  My friend and I were taking photos of the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Insect in flight?  PD));2016-08-24 23:30:00;00:20.00;I stayed the night at Pinon Flats in Great Sand Dunes, CO, last week.  During my stay, my friend and I were taking photos of the night sky at our campsite.  I was going through the photos this evening when I came across a series of photos taken at a slow shutter speed where four lights in a straight line move across the sky.  I sent images over via e-mail. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photographs, and the object in question appears to us probably to be the wingbeats of a flying insect, flying in a straight line.  We do not believe the object is an alien spacecraft.  PD));37.6396;-105.8054
