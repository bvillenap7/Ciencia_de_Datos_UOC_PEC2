In the Mesa Junction area, I saw 3 big bright red lights, they were spread about in a triangular formation and appeared very close and quiet.  They were very slow and hovered for a bit.   One started to blink then disappeared, the other two got closer together then spread apart they started blinking at each other and then one disappeared then the other disappeared.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Balls of light or fire seen just south of Pueblo, CO.;2018-03-01 00:00:00;3-5 minutes;Balls of light or fire seen just south of Pueblo, CO. I was in my car when I saw several orange balls of light aligned horizontally.  They moved together in sync and accelerated and decelerated at the same time.  They appeared over Saint Charles Reservoir at Stem Beach 10miles away.  They would disappear and then re appear as giant balls of light.  They left my view moving with a stealthy pace behind some trees.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
