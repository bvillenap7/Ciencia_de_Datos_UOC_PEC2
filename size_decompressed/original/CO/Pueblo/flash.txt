Red flash of light in the sky;2010-10-13 01:00:00;5 seconds;Red flash of light in the sky I was driving on an early Wednesday afternoon when I happened to look up to the sky for a brief second.   It was at that time that I saw a small red flash of light eminate from the sky.   I then carefully watched the area in the sky where I saw the flash, but did not see any further activity from any sort of aircraft.  Whatever it was I saw had completely disappeared without a trace.
