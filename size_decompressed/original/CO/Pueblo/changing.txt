One paused for several munites than began moving in formation with the other as they got closer together.  Both were yellow in color, went from very dim to very bright several times.  Made no sound.  Light source was steady, not flashing or shimmering.  Not like anything I've ever seen before.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131

Three lights, western sky, in a line evenly spaced, left to right.  Burning yellow in color. Almost sparkler like.  Then mass of lights same color and effect, to the right, (north),  some distance from original three.  They turned off, then two lights same effect, in original linear arry.  Turned off shortly ofter turning on.   Moments later, array of three lights, same color, larger and more complex, center light slightly lower than two on far left and far right.  A shallow triangle, if you will.  These lights were definitely unusual.  Western sky, from south-central Pueblo. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Yellow-orange arrays of lights, appearing and disappearing over Lake Minnequa, Pueblo CO, or to the West of Pueblo, south of hwy 47.;2018-03-01 21:15:00;~5 minutes;Yellow Orange arrays of lights, appearing and disappearing over Lake Minnequa, Pueblo CO, or to the West of Pueblo, south of hwy 47. My friend and I were getting out of is truck in front of my home, to go inside.  He noticed a strange light in the sky to the west over the treeline.  I turned and saw nothing at first, he said it went off, then just as I was about to give up, and go inside, it appeared again.  The first sighting was as a heading of about 260 degrees, it looked like a somewhat linear cluster of yellow orageish lights, very close together.  If the lights were a solid object, (I got the impression they were on a solid object).  It appeared to be banked at about a 45 to 225 degree angle.  It suddenly disappeared, we talked about it, and kept visually scanning the sky.  I turned away, he saw it again. It disappeared again, then as we talked about  it and studied the sky some more, I saw it as just three points of yellow orange light, brighter than the firsst time I saw it, but with fewer lights showing at about 245 degrees.  The three lights were oriented so as to form the three corners! of an oblate triangle.  They shown for a few seconds then went out again.  We watched the sky a while longer but never saw them again. The lights were moving, but relative to us seemed very slow.  The could have been as close at half a mile away, over Minnequa Lake, or much farther away. Of course, if they were much further away the ob object would have been massive. It’s a dark clear night, there is a moon but it was not within our scope of vision.  Nearby there is a hospital heliport roughly 220 degrees from our position,  Helicopters can be heard from here running up there engines, taking off, and landing, but there were no obvious aircraft running or navigating from out position. I’ve seen lots of aircraft landing lights in my time, the oblate triangle shape resembled an array of landing lights arranged on landing gear of aiircraft, but, they weren’t the color, cool white of landing lights I’d seen in the past, and there is no nearby airport for a plane to be landing at in that direction, nor were there any sign of red, green, becon, or strobe lights.  Again, the lights we saw were the color of sodium vapour street lights.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
