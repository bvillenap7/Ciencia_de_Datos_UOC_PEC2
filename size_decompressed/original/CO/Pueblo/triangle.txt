These objects were illuminated in a blue-white continuous light. My wife and I witnessed their flight from the south horizon to the North horizon  in a matter of a few seconds. About 15 minutes later we saw them return from the north in a different path, being approx. 5 degrees above the Eastern Horizon.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Black Triangle in sky about 35 mi south of NORAD;1996-08-01 17:00:00;3 min;Black Triangle in sky about 35 mi south of NORAD About 35 miles from Cheyenne Mountain Colorado Springs, Co.  My girlfriend and I were stopped at a stop sign facing East.  It was close to dusk, the sun had droped behind the mountians, I didn't need the cars headlights to drive.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye, a slow moving craft that I thought was a B-2.  As soon I looked, I knew the craft was not a Aircraft that was known to me.  I just sat there slack jawed, my girlfriend said something like go, it's clear!, I just pointed head at the craft.  The craft was moving slow and I precieved low, appox 500-800 feet.  It was about 5 thumbs wide when over head. I've worked at an airport and can judge speed fairly close, my best guess is that the craft was woving at about 50-75 mph. when the the craft came close to overhead I shut off the cars motor, the craft was silent.  I've seen and heard the F-117 in flight at about 100 feet,  I've refueled civilian and military aircraft of all makes.  I know how conventional aircraft sound and what they look like in flight, this was NO conventional aircraft. It was black, with a light color circle at each point (not lite up), it traveled east to west directly over the city and was in view for about 3 minutes.

Strange  craft over Pueblo Colorado;2000-09-19 19:00:00;10 minutes;Strange  craft over Pueblo Colorado It was just a few minutes past seven, mountain standard time, when I went out to my backyard to talk to my wife, who was swimming. As I walked through our sliding glass door, I noticed a funny looking light about three to five thousand feet above the center of the city of Pueblo.  This distance was about a mile from my house.  From plain eyesight, the color of the object was opaque.  It was like an opal in the sky.  Furthermore, it stood stationary in the sky with no movement for a duration of ten minutes.  I unpacked my binocular and took a second look. Wow, this was incredible, a triangle shaped craft with three bright dots inside, one in each corner.  I then unpacked my spotting scope and viewed the object. Double WOW, this was one of the most amazing objects I've ever seen. Of course there were no stars out at this time, so it wasn't that. Furthermore, the object remained stationary for ten minutes, which eleminates an aircraft. About the time I zoomed in on the object for a second time it took off at a high rate of speed. I took my eye from the lense and followed it from about three thousand feet to about fifty to seventy thousand feet in a matter of two seconds, counting one one thousand two one thousand.  What ever it was, wasn't from this planet. It's one of those strange things that I'll always remember.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Multiple UFO sightings in Pueblo 09/22/01;2001-09-22 21:00:00;3 hours;Multiple UFO sightings in Pueblo 09/22/01 Four of us were sitting on lawn chairs out on our deck at approx 9:00 p.m MST, Sept. 22nd 2001 in Pueblo, Colorado. There was a nice light breeze and thin clouds with spaces between them were continuously rolling over the mountain range out to the east. The moon was approx 1/4 and out to the south west about 30-40 degrees, with clouds obscuring it sometimes. Observer 1 noticed an object directly upward which at first glance could be mistaken for a bright star, only he said it was moving. He pointed it out to us, and myself(observer 2) and observer 3 also could see it moving, almost fluttering around much like a bee, kind of bouncing ever so slightly. We kept watching it and started noticing there were many more overhead that were moving around too. They all appeared as stars at first, some more intense in light than the others. The light was constant, not blinking, but fading in and out. Observer 3 said he saw a blue light coming from one of them, changing back and forth from blue to white occasionaly. I personally noticed about 3 or 4 of these things moving, dancing on the edges of the clouds, almost trying to hide themselves with the moving clouds. They never went too far from their apparent location in the sky, but appeared to all of us that they were rapidly changing up and down in altitude at times, the light would sometimes be diffused by the clouds. We called my mom out, observer 4 to take a look. She said she could see them moving around too. Remember, this is just my account of this eyewitness, and I may have forgotten a few things, as I am writing this 24 hours after the sighting. Nevertheless, it is still very freshly ingrained in my mind. I am going to encourage the others to post their accounts of this on this website too. Just after observer 4 saw these objects, observer 3 decided to go home. Us 3 kept watching the skies, and woke my dad up to come see at approx 9:30. He looked for a just a few minutes and didn't seem to interested or convinced and went back inside and went to ! bed. Us 3 kept watching, myself and observer 3 lied down on the benches on the deck so we could see straight up. There seemed to be more and more of them appearing out of nowhere, fluttering around the clouds, which were diminishing and the skies gradually getting clearer. When all of a sudden, 2 seconds of sheer terror and astonishment at the same time. A triangular shaped, HUGE OBJECT, darts across the sky, seeming to be relatively low in elevation, and MASSIVE in size. It was almost like a shadow, an ominous bird taking up a good portion of our view. It could have been a very tight formation of several craft, or just one HUGE one. I thought I saw maybe nine arrow like faint lights or reflections of city lights below all pointing forward, almost like a formation jets fly in. We yelled out because this thing was flat out the fastest thing I have ever seen in my life. It covered the portion of the sky visible to us in those one to at most two seconds we saw it. Not only that but perhaps the biggest thing too. It was probably only in view for only 1-2 seconds. All of us saw it, and realized we had shrieked out in amazement, saying what the hell was that!!!!!!!!!! I can't begin to tell you what kind of feeling came across me, and us. Goosebumps and heart racing. It was so stealthy, appearing kind of neutral in color, not dark and not light, almost transparent, but blocking the background above it. It was going due South, DIRECTLY over us. Observer 3 said it reminded her of a huge Thunderbird. It appeared to be about only a couple thousand feet up, and about as big as my hand when held as far away as possible. As we gathered ourselves and asked eachother about it, while still looking up, another one flew over, maybe 5 or 10 minutes after the first one. We all briefly screamed again, because we were excited about seeing the first one, and something that moves that fast is supposed to scare you!! We are ALL CERTAIN we saw the same thing. This one didn't appear as large, but going just as fast, who could estimate the ! speed of these things, but I would say several thousand miles an hour, that fast!!!!!!!! IMPRESSIVE.... At this point we were wonderin what the hell was going on, almost like being in a dream, where you can't believe your eyes. But it's real and you know it. We live on the outskirts of town where many people have animals, and we heard dogs barking, horses and donkeys beying, pet geese making all kinds of noise. The second (relative to the size) also appeared to be flying low, maybe half as large as the first one that flew directly overhead, north to south just as the first. They made NO noise whatsoever, and left no trails, only in view for an instant. They appeared to be going straight and at a constant velocity, real damn fast. How could this be happening? Are they ours? I don't see how they could be, given the apparent size and speed. But you never know. All the while, these star looking lights, that were moving around, almost confined to an area, started to have more activity. We witnessed several of them shoot across the sky over the next hour or so, almost like meteor trals, but the trails much much longer then a meteorite's, but not seeing that ominous big bird again. Observer 1 was freaking out a little, and decided to go inside to sleep. Myself and observer 3 stayed outside, waiting and watching when whizzzzzzzzz Two light colored objects about 70 degrees up to the east of us, coming out of the North again, going south, were two light colored Diamand shaped craft, resembling big planes with only wings and no tail or fuseloge, whizzed across the sky with the same breakneck speed, then the were gone, disappearing as quickly as they appeared. Where are they going? Back to Nevada or New Mexico? Or better question, where are the coming from? We might never know. But we have to believe, anyone looking in the Pueblo skies that night HAD to have seen it too, just too much activity, too many things moving, and the flyovers, those were enormous crafts, too big to miss, but maybe too fast for someone to see if n! ot looki ng up at all times. This had started at about 9:00 pm and at midnight, still happening. I think I had seen some sort of UFO sighting about 12 years ago, but it was nothing as convincing and REAL and fast and awesome as this. So us two keep looking at the skies and noticed a formation of flickering lights off to the east about 30-40 degrees up. It looked like a mini little dipper constellation, only the objects were dancing around this look alike formation, way to small to be the little dipper. We kept watching this because it seems to have appeared out of nowhere. The objects seemed to be about 2-3 times the width in length, appeared bluish white in light, and danced and tumbled around almost like a school of fish. We were getting tired and weary and decided to go to sleep. That's it. Hope to see them again, next time I will have my camcorder on a tripod, recording constantly looking straight up. I didn't have it at the time of the sighting and no pictures were taken. This eyewitness was just too eery and too scary not to report, I'm sure some people will think I'm crazy, but 4 people can't see the same thing and it not be real. Besides, I'm almost certain that other people in the Pueblo area had to see it and will hopefully report this as well.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Silent large flying v of 5 orange glowing patches gives fright.;2002-10-01 05:35:00;10-15seconds;Silent large flying v of 5 orange glowing patches gives fright. At Between 5:30am and 5:35am i was delivering papers while walking through a local trailer court. I stopped to look up at the Orion constelation and find a star that usually appears to be flashing red, white and blue this time of year just bellow and north of it...I dont know why i do that... it is just is interesting to me.  This time I saw something that has permanently changed my mind about all the UFO stories. Just the south of me i noticed a VERY faint pumpkin orange glow and thought i was going to get to see a meteor start up as i turned my head slightly i realized that there were 5 very square shaped glowing patches in a v shape heading north slightly south and east of were i was standing. I intently tried to focus my sight on this and realized that as they were moving the stars behind were blocked out in a very black v area behind them and that the faint orange squares were more rectangular and bent over the leading edge of a wing like structure...try as i might i could not get any other visual ques as to the exact shape of what was going by right in front of me. I was trying to get an idea of the trailing shape but could not because as the stars would reapear behind it they seemed distorted, like in a mirage, by wave like disruption of the star light. I stood there fixed in total disbeleif of what i was seeing! As it passed almost over me and in front of me it made NO SOUND what so ever! I would guess that it was was about half again bigger than a stealth bomber(which i have seen flying over head at the Air Force Academy graduation twice, only about 40miles from here) and about 1500 feet off the ground, I had the impression for a second that it was a stealth bommber gliding but it was a little too big and there is no where close in that direction for it to glide to. as it passed to my left the orange glowing patches became almost impossible to see on the bottom edge of it and became smaller as though they were on the front edge of a wing but still absolutely no sound! I couldnt keep an eye on ! it after a few more seconds since there were no more visable stars in that area to see it blocking them. I stood there for 5 to 10 minutes looking all over trying to see if it would come back, but it never did. I would guess that it was traveling about 2 to 3 times faster than the C130s we have fly over us all the time and was about twice the wing span. I couldnt tell any thing beyond that it looked generaly like a flying wing since there was nothing but the 5 orange patches and the blacked out shape behind them. The orange patches were extremely faint, less bright than the stars of Orions belt, as if they were reflectors instead of lights, but i cant figgure out what they could have reflected since it is still pretty dark at 5:30am. I would love to know what it realy was if anyone knows. I would guess it was putting out a lot of heat to make the stars seem wavy but how does it do it with absolutely no noise? If thisv is government or visitor??? I would be quicker to beleive a government secret but I may never know for sure. If any-one does know please tell me mysteries drive me nuts!;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131

After a few seconds of traveling in a straight line, it simply vanished into the night light, not making a trace of what direction it went.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Creme white triangular craft and streak behind it.;2011-08-05 20:50:00;4 seconds;Creme white triangular craft and streak behind it. I sat in my backyard having a cigarette facing north and a small streak of light across the sky caught my eye.  I looked directly at it and it was a lighted triangular craft heading from west to east. It had a streak behind it about 15 times the length of the craft.  Both the craft and the streak behind it were illuminated a creme white color. I do no know its approximate altitude or distance from me, but it appeared to fly at the same distance and altitude as other planes that regularly fly at low altitude over the area.  It was moving much faster than the average planes that fly over this area at low altitude.  I watched the craft for about 4 seconds before it and the streak behind it seemed to vanish at the same time.  There were no clouds in the immediate area and I could see stars all along its patch and in the direction it was heading, so it couldn't have disappeared behind a cloud.  I heard no sound other than the cars driving by.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131

One red blinking one in the middle, hovering motion I and the other witness were driving down the street when he turned to me and said that he saw a ship in the sky.  I first did not believe him but then heard the urgency in his voice, so I proceeded to pull over. We saw 4 lights:  one at the front and two in the back and a blinking red one in the middle.  The other witness saw the craft for about 25 seconds and I saw it for about 5.  We look at it for a second as it hovered and then watched it until it slowly hovered downward to where we could no longer see it.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131

It began to move around so I called for my friend to come see.  It flew slowly in several directions, came toward us and then we could see it was rather triangle shaped.  Kind of resembled a stealth.  Then slowly it moved away. It seemed like it was following the street.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131

I could clearly see it through a Leoupold 40x spotting scope.  Saw the shape, sun reflecting from it and a tether/cord hanging from the bottom apex.   Didn't move much.  Sun went down far enough and it was hardly visible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
