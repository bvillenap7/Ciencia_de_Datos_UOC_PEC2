Diamond shape hovering over mountains;2011-07-28 00:00:00;37 minutes;Diamond shape hovering over mountains I had gone on a roadtrip from El Paso, Texas, to Denver, Colorado with my mom, sister, and her friend. It was between 3:00 am and 3:37 am that I had seen what looked like a shooting star it a lit up the sky for a good couple of seconds.   Fascinated, I kept watch in the sky.   A couple of minutes later, I noticed that there was what looked like a huge diamond shape with an outline of stars/lights hovering just above the mountains.  It stayed completely stilllater I lost sight of it then it appeared again but now was in a different position.   So I did some research and I came across your website and found a ufo sighting report that was very similar to mine the Bayfield, Colorado Report of Sunday May, 8th, 2011.   I looked into it and that sighting was reported to be ALSO over the mountains.  I'd say that I was probably in the same spot the people from the other ufo sighting were just on the OTHER side of the mountain.   I was really shocked to see the picture from the! report was so disturbingly similar to mine I drew out what I saw on a piece of notebook paper (didnt have a camera).  It was an exhilarating experience.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
