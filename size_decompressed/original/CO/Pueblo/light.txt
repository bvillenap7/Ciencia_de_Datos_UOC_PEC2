Stange cluster of lights in SouthWestern Sky of Pueblo Colorado;2001-12-06 19:40:00;5 min;Stange cluster of lights in SouthWestern Sky of Pueblo Colorado 2 of us  were on Mountain Bikes riding with night lights  West of Pueblo near the Pueblo Motorsports Park (a recreational area set aside for motocross, mountain biking, hiking and such). It was dark and about 7:40 PM MST.  Our exact location was near the water tower on the bluff  overlooking the Pueblo Resevoir area, on the eastern edge of Pueblo West.  My friend and I had stopped for a moment and I walked behind a tree to relieve myself.  As I started to walk back I noticed 3 bright lights which I thought were flares.  These lights were about 15-20 degrees off of the horizon in the SouthWest portion of the sky over the area of Wetmore Colorado (25-30 miles Southwest).   When the lights disappeared I walked back to my bicycle and asked observer #2 is she had seen the lights?  She saw them too because they reappeared about then.  We looked to see if they might be landing lights of a plane disappearing and reapperaing behind the clouds,  but there were no clouds.  We saw the blinking light of a plane in the same general area but saw no association between it and these lights.  The sky was  star filled. We got a reference to the mountain range that sits below and they were definitely above the mountains.  We wondered if they might be distress flares from someone in the mountains, but the lights never moved downward like flares do.  They just stayed in the same spot, disappearing and reappearing.  Each appearance lasted  20-40  seconds for about 4 times.    There were always 3 lights.  They were always in the same position but  their positioning was not symetrical.  They each had about the same intensity of light and were of the same size (about 1/4 in diameter on the scale we were viewing).  One was  slightly higher than the others and slightly to the West.  The other two were closer together with the lower one slightly East of the center one.  They disappeared after about 4 or 5 minutes.  We do not know what these lights were.  Perhaps someone else from Colorado saw them too?;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Suspended orange lights in Northwest sky;2003-10-23 21:00:00;20 seconds;Suspended orange lights in Northwest sky I was in Central Pueblo looking towards the northwest when I noticed above treeline two orange lights in the sky.  After approximately 1 second, two lights became 3, a second later 3 lights became 4 lights.  They were not moving, just suspended in the sky.  To get a closer look I stood up from my porch and saw what I thought was a shooting star, the same color as the lights suspended in the sky, come out of the eastern sky towards the suspended lights.  Once the shooting star contacted with the suspended lights, all lights went out.  I also heard what seemed like all the dogs in the neighborhood barking, but not barking at anyone in particular.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
This object was definitely like nothing I have ever seen, and I observe the night sky nightly.;2003-12-09 18:00:00;5 minutes;This object was definitely like nothing I have ever seen, and I observe the night sky nightly. The object was a bright silver blue light that was 45 degrees above the horizon.  It traveled from west to east.  It was definitely not an airplane.  I thought it was the space station.  While I was inside getting binoculars, my 10 yr. old daughter said that it turned reddish then disappeared.  I have never seen that large and bright light in the sky.  We watched the sky for several minutes after but did not see it again. I think it was something entering earth's atmosphere.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131

My boyfriend and I were stopped at a train track while a train was going by and I happened to look up.  There in the northwest were about seven lights which looked to be attached to about three objects.  The lights moved very strangely.  They came and went in no pattern, flashed in and out for the whole time the train took to go by. They were circular and mostly white with maybe a hint of red to them.  They were extremely bright and were like nothing I’ve seen before.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Lights floating above ground from Pueblo County, Colorado;2014-09-03 21:15:00;9;Lights floating above ground from Pueblo County, Colorado I was driving to Colorado Springs, Colorado from Pueblo County, Colorado between the hours of 8:45pm-9:30pm. As I was driving past the Elpaso County sign just a 1/4 of a mile north of exit 116 on I-25, I noticed a light in the northeast corner of my windshield window, off in the distance towards Peyton, Colorado. The soft orangish white light seemed to hover about a 1/2 Mile in the air, slowly dimming out and eventually it reappeared with the full brightness it had before dimming out. The time frame of it being lit in the sky was about 3 minutes slowly floating to the east.  About a year earlier I was in the town of Pueblo, Colorado, filling up on gas, and I looked towards the north, yet again to see the same floating lights, not one, but a total of three slowly floating in the night sky for about 3 minutes, and disappeared then reappeared for a final time for about 3 minutes before dying out.  I have tried doing extensive research on the mysterious ghost lights, but unable to fine answers.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Two bright red lights that disappeared.;2016-01-09 08:30:00;2-5 minutes;Two bright red lights that disappeared. A red ball of light looked like it was taking off going higher, and higher but in West direction.  I noticed 2 blinking lights had passed in front of the light, as it begain to fade, and disappear.   Then a second light from the same area that we seen the first light.  It was rising and rising till it disappeared.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
UFO sighting in Colorado July 24, @9:21pm;2019-07-24 21:21:00;15 minutes;UFO sighting in Colorado July 24, @9:21pm (I have a possible ufo sighting I need to send to you, but gmail isn't allowing me to attach)  I apologize in advance for the language in my video... But I've never seen anything like this in my life.  My name is Michelle. I live in the Pueblo, CO, area.  I captured this tonight…  Two separate, glowing orange & red lights in the pikes peak/Cheyenne Mountain area. This area is ALWAYS dark at night....  I have lived here over a year and have not once seen anything like what I saw just now.  The orange and red lights went off and on for several minutes before i grabbed my camera. I thought at first it was flares, due to the color.  Then i realized it was something else.  Possibly two things.  But then there was this odd glow behind the two Orange and red lights i was unable to catch on camera.  But it seemed as though something was behind the lights.  It was so bizarre....  You can even see the helicopters flashing lights next to it within a few minutes.  (Basically the time it took me to walk inside to grab a camera)  And occasionally you can hear this really weird metallic sound…  I have seen and heard a lot of weird things, but never like this...;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Traveling lights over Pueblo.  ((Starlink satellites??);2020-04-28 20:50:00;2-3 minutes;Traveling lights over Pueblo Was just sitting outside with my friend and looking up at the stars, when a perfectly straight line of what looked like stars in the sky went traveling by. There were at least 15 to 20 of these things and were traveling in perfect alignment an equal distance away from each other when the one near or at the front broke away and went back in a scoop motion and seemed to be checking on all the others. We tried to get it on video, but it was too high in the sky. If it wasn't military jets, then I have no idea what could do this.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
