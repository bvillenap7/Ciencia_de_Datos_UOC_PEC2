The fireball was spotted my many people I was sitting in my living room looking out the window when I saw a Blue fireball hovering over only about a mile away northeast from my house on the southside of town.  I jumped up to look closer out the window and the blue light dropped down within a split second out of sight.  I didn't think much of it, but then on Saturday there was an article in the paper which explained that the mysterious fireball that I saw was also seen by many people in Denver, and around the Nebraska-Colorado border.  The article said that authorties have not determined what it was.  So the blue fireball was seen in Pueblo aroun 8:45pm then was spotted at 9:30 near Kimball, Sidney, Chadron and in the Denver area. ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the witness that there may have been more than one object, and at different times.  We would like to receive reports from anyone who witnessed the object(s) on this date.  PD));38.292343852459;-104.661419672131

With the curtains drawn and the room lighted, I saw the outline of a fireball with a green/blue tint come down almost vertically.  I would say the event took place just a few degrees east of due north.   It reminded me of a firework with a trail behind it, and since it appeared to come straight down over my neighbor's house that's what I thought it was. I hope this helps in pinpointing the location of a possible impact.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131

It was stationary and never moved but it was bright and not anything like a planet or star.  I've seen these objects here in Pueblo before.   About 4 years ago i was talking a walk through the park late at night and there must of been 10 to 15 of these lights in the sky.  I've never seen these lights anywhere else except in Pueblo.

Yellow fireballs spotted  in evenning sky west of Pueblo Co.;2013-03-06 19:20:00;3 seconds;Yellow fireballs spotted  in evenning sky west of Pueblo Co I was heading south on I-25 just getting into Pueblo,Co at aprox. 1920 hours and happend to be looking towards the west when I saw what I thought was a metiorite exploding or skipping off the atmosphere between 6-8 times because of the fireballs it created. I've listend to the news and online to find out what it was, but nothing has been reported. I only just now heard that this seems to be something other than what I thought it was, so I'm reporting it. Like I said, it was 6-8 very bright orange/yellow fireballs over the mountains due west of town. It only lasted about 3 seconds and they looked like the went out very quickly thereafter, only a couple more seconds after they appeared. Nothing seems to have been reported about them and I haven't heard that anyone else saw them;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
8 orange, bright lights seen in Pueblo, Colorado, skies.;2014-02-14 19:00:00;5 minutes;8 orange, bright lights seen in Pueblo, Colorado, skies. 7 or 8 fireballs in the sky.  They were very dim lights, then all of a sudden they all turned bright orange and moved and vanished.  It was dark outside, and they seemed very close.   They were out west of Pueblo, Colorado.  I didn't hear any sound and couldn't see any shapes to the bright orange lights.  There was nothing in the background but the dark sky so the bright orange fireballs were very noticeable.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Three large fireballs hover in place just north of Pueblo, CO;2014-08-23 01:00:00;3 minutes;Three large fireballs hover in place just north of Pueblo, CO I was driving north 75mph on I-25 with 2 other passengers at 1:00am MST.  We were almost halfway between Pueblo and Colorado Springs when we noticed two large bright orange fireballs, suspended in the sky about 400 feet above the ground and perhaps a mile or two away from us over the hills to the west.  We agreed the must have been fairly large at their distance, each perhaps the size of a 2 story house.  These fireballs appeared to be emitting smoke we could see trails of smoke in the air lit up by the orange glow from the balls.  We commented and started taking video, still driving (we never did pull over or break speed).    After about 30 seconds, a third fireball appeared, as a tiny dot that cut slightly across the sky but grew in size to equal the other fireballs, over the course of 1-2 seconds.  The three fireballs were, as far as we could tell, hovering in place in the air for 2-3 minutes, casting a glow on the hills nearby, burning bright orange and emitting smoke.  They did not appear to move very much if at all as we drove past the event.  We rounded a bend and lost sight of them behind a hill, and when we came to the other side a few moments later, they were gone.  ** I will soon obtain the video my passenger took on his cell phone and post in on YouTube.  I will title it Fireballs north of Pueblo, August 23, 2014  **;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
