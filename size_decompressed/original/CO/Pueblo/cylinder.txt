While watching fireworks, I saw two red dots a little bigger than Venus (?) which was directly to the South.  They were almost attached together it seemed in a vertical position with  another green light halfway between them protruding to the left.  I heard no noise and most of the time the object was behind two large elm trees so I couldn't see much of it. It did move out to the West  and completely stopped for three or four minutes.  Then it reversed course and returned to where it had been behind the trees.  I also saw it move in a curved or irregular motion then stop inexplicably  It couldn't be an airplane because it would be motionless for a few minutes at a time.  All the while the three lights retained the same position with regard to each other, with the two red lights in a vertical alignment. Once or twice I saw it zig-zag then completely stop.  It seemed capable of moving at least three or four thousand miles an hour and then completely stopping.  The las! t glimpse I got of it it was moving South toward the horizon and slowly out of sight.  It made no noise and seemed so far away that I couldn't make out what it could be.  I know it sounds silly but it seemed to be watching the fireworks far below in Pueblo.  Could it be some people on Earth with laser lights all focused on one point to create the illusion of something solid in the sky?;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
