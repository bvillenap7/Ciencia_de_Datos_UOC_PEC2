Orange firery ball moving slowly across horizon.;2012-05-26 21:23:00;10 to 15 seconds;orange firery ball moving slowly across horizon. It was approximately 9:23 pm. On 05.26.2012, that a friend of mine who was with me looked up in the sky and asked what is that!! I, then looked into the sky, and saw a reddish orange ball, moving from the south to the north.  It was approximately the size of a dime at a 45 degree angle from my position facing east.  From the time I first saw it from the time it disappeared, heading north east, it was approximately 10 to 15 seconds.  I am positive it was not an air craft, because there was zero blinking lights and no sound. I would urge anyone else who witnessed this UFO sighting, to do a report on this sight or contact your local media.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131

Distant round object overhead with flashing light at center only visible with binoculars.;2020-07-28 21:00:00;15 minutes;Distant round object overhead with flashing light at center only visible with binoculars. Just after sunset tonight, just as the stars were starting to show, I noticed a “star” overhead but slightly to the east that looked bigger than usual for any star at this time.  It wasn’t necessarily brighter, but it seemed rounder like a planet would be if it were closer.   I took out the Skyview app on my iPhone to see what might be in that location, but the app indicated nothing.  Using the app, I could see that the object was approximately between the stars Vega and Etamin, but appeared to be moving slowly west.     I retrieved my binoculars to get a better look as the object appeared to be either getting smaller or moving further away (up?).   Through the binoculars I could clearly see a round disc or orb with a flashing white point of light at the center that seemed similar to what might be on an aircraft.   I thought maybe I was seeing a balloon from below with a light beneath it.  But I could not imagine a balloon being this high or in this region, ! though I suppose it is possible.     After a few minutes the object and surrounding stars were obscured by clouds.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
