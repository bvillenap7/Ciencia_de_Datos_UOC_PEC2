Dark, spinning object morphing into shapes.;2009-03-07 12:00:00;2 min.;Dark, spinning object morphing into shapes. 	Taking a walk during my lunch break I had this immediate feeling that I should look up, and when I did I saw a large, round, dark object . This object was spinning slowly and had the look of burnished metal or plastic. It began to come closer and I was determined to not look away no matter what, so I got a really good look at it. The object never stopped spinning and sort of glided in the wind, was out of the SSW, and was moving against the wind. It appeared very stark against the background of high, fluffy, white clouds. The object moved directly overhead and was stationary for a good 15 seconds. The bottom appeared to be almost plastic with a few brownish marks on it. The surface seemed to fold in on itself--not like liquid in an operating blender would do, but kind of wrinkled together. It had to be 30-40 ft. in diameter. I recently went back to the sighting location so I could get a better fix on the objectâ€™s size. There are two old coke mill towers right next to where I was standing at the time of the sighting that are about 10 stories high, and this thing had to be no more than 200 ft. above me. It was large. Then, as I watched, it moved very gracefully, (against the wind) to the SSW, and as it did I saw at about 600 ft away, it either rolled onto its side or morphed to a classic saucer shape. I continued to watch and after a couple more hundred feet it changed again to delta sort of shape! Its movement was very fluid and very well defined, and the way it moved is rather difficult to describe. It sort of slipped and dipped in the air from one place to another. A full-blown daylight sighting I will never forget!;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
