V shaped luminous streak with smoke trail;1999-11-04 00:28:00;4-5 sec;V shaped luminous streak with smoke trail Very much like many meteor events I've seen over the years except that this event had some unusual characteristics.  The object leaving the trail had a distinct V shape to it, such as the dihedral of a flying wing. If referenced to a flat plane, this object had a dihedral of about 15 degrees on each side (as a wing bent downwards would display) as displaced below the horizontal plane -- an inverted V.  The event occurred at 12:28 AM MST, 11-4-99. The objects heading appeared to be about 030-045 degrees true with an azimuth of about 30 degrees above the 'Western' horizon. The event duration was visible for 4-5 seconds, and the trail length was about 5 Full Moon diameters, and the trail width was about 1/2-1/3 Full Moon diameters.  The most unusual feature of this event was the V shape smoke trail and concurrent light flare, (V  shaped cross-section of the trail & light pattern).

My fiance and I observed a cloudy shape moving from west to east, materializing only briefly as it traveled in between Orion and the Pleiades cluster.   The cloud appeared to be lit from within as it faded in and out of sight.   The night was perfectly clear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

3 orbs (gold, green & white) seen over Southernmost Pueblo over several months & currently active Dec. 2018 - Present.;2018-10-01 21:00:00;Several hours;3 orbs (gold, green & white) seen over Southernmost Pueblo over several months & currently active Dec. 2018 - Present. Sighting was witnessed at a hilltop near the Dogpatch community of Pueblo.  The hilltop offered fantastic views of the city, looking directly to the South. For many years, my cousin and I would sit in our vehicles and spend our time talking, watching videos and listening to music.  Recently, starting in October of 2018, we began seeing bright orbs hovering over what appeared to be the Southernmost part of town.  Further investigation as to the whereabouts of the crafts led to Stembeach, a private lake outside of town or the Lake Minnequa.  The crafts appeared first as a golden color, then as green and finally bright white.  The crafts would usually appear in the same location, varying slightly in altitude.  We still continue to see these objects  (It is currently March of 2019).;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
