3 orange lights seen west of pueblo blvd and arkansas river;2009-01-21 20:00:00;1min 45secs;3 orange lights seen west of pueblo blvd and arkansas river About 8:27pm tonight, 1/21/09, me and my friend were at the Pueblo City Park behind the baseball field and skate park, parked in a car overlooking the river as it goes under Pueblo Blvd. On Google Maps, we were parked at coordinates 38.266590, -104.657360. It was somewhat windy, clear skies and able to see the stars. Looking in the direction of Google Map coordinates 38.273312, -104.667145, on the other side of Pueblo Blvd and on the other side of the river from where we were, we saw an orange light maybe 6-7 stories high. It was an orange sperical light that flashed on and off once. Then a few seconds later it turned on again, then seperated into three seperate orange spheres, extending away from us and to our left looking out toward PMI. The lights then stayed on for about 1 second, fully extended and remaining absolutely still and perfectly aligned to each other despite the wind. Then about 45 seconds later the three seperate orange sphere lights turned on, in the same direction and area as before, but one was closer to the ground and the other two were splayed out away from the other about 8 stories high, but each flashed on simultaneously and off simultaneously, all in a duration of 1 second. Then a few minutes later regular aircraft with required FAA lights flew over and kept flying over. The UFOs were not seen again afterward, and we only saw them at a time when it seemed no air traffic was in the immediate area.  We had parked there because we had seen UFOs there before and figured we might see on tonight. We noticed what seemed to be a bright, large planet out to the west. That planet had been in the exact same spot the night before, but tonight it began to slightly move around in every different direction, not staying stationary, and then it moved farther and faster from where it should have been in the sky. That's what got us to look in that general direction, and then we saw the first flash of the single orange sphere way to the right and close to the ground on the other side of the river. After the orange speheres, we looked back at what should have been a planet and it remained stationary and eventually sat below the horizon with the rest of the stars about 15 minutes after the orange spheres had stopped activity.  My friend who was driving and wants to remain anonymous called his friend who was in pueblo west on his cell phone after the second appearance of the lights and during the third appearance said that his cell phone recepetion cut out slightly during the call, especially during the third appearance of the lights, and after the lights stopped appearing the reception was back to normal. He said the person in pueblo west he was talking to also saw the lights simultaneously.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131

All of the visible stars in the night sky are spacecraft, shaped like spheres.;2015-03-31 00:00:00;ongoing;All of the visible stars in the night sky are spacecraft, shaped like spheres. Get a pair of binoculars and point them toward the sky.  I am in Pueblo, Colorado, and every visible light in the sky is a spherical craft(?)  Some are almost invisible.  (translucent)   There are spheres which are twinkling multiple colors, predominantly red.  I see a low flying sphere, it sounds like an aircraft, but it has a spherical, lit appearance.  Locate the Moon.  The lights, in the sky (?) near the Moon are ALL spheres.  That is all.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
6-8 orange orbs in the night sky.;2016-02-19 19:39:00;2-3 minutes;6-8 orange orbes in the night sky On 02/19/2016, at approx. 1935 hrs., while walking into work, myself an several people witnessed several orange round lights in the western sky.  At first I thought the lights were a formation of U.S. Army helicopters (Ft. Carson is approx. 30 mi. north of Pueblo), but realized the lights were orange and not white.  Also no side aircraft lights that are required while flying over a populated area. I work hospital security,  I am retired, but served in the USMC and was a Sheriff Deputy.  Also standing with me was another Security Officer who is also retired, who also served in the USMC and was a captain with the Colo. Dept. of Corrections. I stopped the other officer an pointed to the lights, at this time, several other hospital employees (shift change) and civilians were also watching these lights. After I figured these lights were not helicopters, I figured they were flares.  The lights started low in the western sky, over the south side of Pueblo, moved at a steady speed and after about 2 to 3 min, pos. more, were almost directly over the hospital slightly to the south.  (Hospital entrance faces south).  I have seen several flares, hand held fired, artillery fired and dropped from aircraft,  Also these lights did not emit light like flares do.  Both me and the other officer decided these lights were unknown.  At this point we started to walking to work, then I got the idea to take a picture, and about a 16 second video.  We entered the building and did not see what happened to the lights. Now at 2200 hrs., I drive our security vehicle, so I listen to Coast to Coast, and hear the UFO reports from Peter Davenport (?) so I decided to file this report.  At the time I witnessed this, there is already a report of this. No further information;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Group of 6-7 red-orange spheres, moving independently at different altitudes;2016-02-19 19:45:00;1 minute;Walking my dogs, I witnessed a group of 6 to 7 red-orange spheres, moving independently at different altitudes.   Were seen for about 1 minute, before they disappeared one-by-one, faded out slowly like flares, but the red-orange color remained solid until they disappeared.   The night is a clear, mild 60 degrees.;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
Observed a stationary bright crimson red , almost laser colored sphere in the north western sky . the object remained completely still;2016-06-28 00:00:00;5 minutes;Observed a stationary bright crimson red , almost laser colored sphere in the north western sky . the object remained completely still for several minutes just above the horizon until two jets flew above the object .  then , the red sphere slowly dropped into the tree line/horizon . the way it lowered was similar to the way a spider comes straight down on its web. It fell at a slow constant speed until out of view . it was somewhat startling how sudden and smooth it fell from view.  I observed the sky for several minutes after but it never reappeared .;38.292343852459;-104.661419672131
