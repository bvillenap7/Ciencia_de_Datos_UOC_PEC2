Bright cloud-emitting orb seen for over 4 hours in Colorado.  ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report is experienced astronomer.  PD));2021-07-04 22:00:00;at least 4 hours;Bright cloud-emitting orb seen for over 4 hours in Colorado At approximately 22:00 on 7/04/21, from a location 10 miles south of Peyton CO, I observed, in the southwestern (essentially cloudless) sky at about 60 degrees elevation, a bright apparently spherical object, glowing at about minus 3 (-3) magnitude.  The object alternately hovered and moved quickly in various directions, but stayed within about a 10 degree circle for at least FOUR HOURS.  The accompanying video shows smoke-like emissions surrounding the object. I am both a professional (having taught college astronomy) and also an amateur astronomer, and have spent many hundreds of hours looking at the night sky.  This is not any sort of astronomical phenomenon.;38.9541;-104.5472
