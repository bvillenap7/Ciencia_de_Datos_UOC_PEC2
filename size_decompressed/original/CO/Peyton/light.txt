Helicopter following light, Peyton Colorado;2007-02-07 20:20:00;45 sec;Helicopter following light, Peyton Colorado I just seen a helicopter about 500-1000 feet up following a tiny point of light. The light looked to be about 500 feet in front of the helicopter. They seemed to move at the same speed and altitude. The light seemed to be about the size of one of the helicopters lights but was not flashing and was a strange pink color, not a even color all over. It is a partly cloudy, very dark night and I was outside. No porch light on and no traffic way out here.  I seen a similar object on or about Jan. 6th, during the day but there were no other aircrafts in the sky.;38.9541;-104.5472
