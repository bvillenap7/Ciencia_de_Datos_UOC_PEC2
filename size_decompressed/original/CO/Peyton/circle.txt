Lights proceeded to blink in and out and form into linear patterns of up to four lights, sometimes merging and disappearing only for another light to appear somewhere higher up the line.  Lines were vertical to the horizon.   Originally thought it was live fire practice but these lights were hovering and moving in ways the do not match what live fire would do and there was no sound.   Husband and I both have video of the event.  After about ten minutes the lights disappeared altogether.   Drove by Peterson AFB the next morning to see if anything could have made the lights, but there are no towers high enough, large enough or bright enough to have made them.;38.9541;-104.5472
