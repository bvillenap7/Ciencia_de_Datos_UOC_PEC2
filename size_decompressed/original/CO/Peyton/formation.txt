I notice fairly fast movement.  First thought was a meteor.  ((anonymous report));2017-04-30 22:00:00;5 seconds;Outside smoking, clear sky  when I notice fairly fast movement. First thought was a meteor, because it was moving very fast, but very faint.  When I was able to focus on the movement, I could tell it was two very faint lights a distance apart from each other but keeping the same distance.  Faded out as it traveled northward.  It was too fast to be an airplane (airplanes are common sightings around here and this was to low and going to fast with no noise at all) with no flashing lights, only very faded white.   I would of missed it if I was looking elsewhere it was that fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.9541;-104.5472
