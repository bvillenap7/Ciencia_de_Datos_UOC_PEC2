Craft of unknown description.…;2003-01-25 19:30:00;10 minutes;a craft of unknown description.... I witnessed a craft that was not an airplane or a helicopter. It was a boomerang shaped object that was covered in various colored lights, and had many pinpoint lights...like what planes have on their tails.....but there were lots of them. It sparkled like a diamond in the light. It moved in erratic and figure eight patterns n the sky, like no known aircraft. It hovered in the night sky moving in erratic patterns, then would move quickly below the line of sight...almost like it was landing....then appear again in the sky. The colored lights were briliant...as were the almost sparkling pinpoint white lights. Ive seen airplanes and helicopters...and neither would be able to float in such patterns as this craft. I was delivering pizza when I became transfixed by this object in the sky. I estimate the body was between 30-50 feet in width.;39.1666;-108.723
Rapidly flashing green light in the west, moving steadily towards the northwest and gaining altitude;2014-03-28 20:20:00;~10;Rapidly flashing green light in the west, moving steadily towards the northwest and gaining altitude A green flashing light caught my attention in my peripheral vision.  I discarded it as an airplane originally and didn’t pay too much attention to it.  I didn’t even look at it at that point.  Something didn’t seem right about it so once I sat down, I paid more attention to it.  The light was flashing very rapidly and almost a twinkling type of flashing.  It was not the typical flashing of an airplane or helicopter.  It was very distinctly rapid (more rapid than an airplane or helicopter lights). I’ve never seen anything flash like that.  The object seemed to be stationary at first.  I stared at it and it still seemed to stay still.   As I kept watching it I noticed the object was moving further away.  I originally saw the light in the western sky and it was moving towards the northwest and was gaining altitude.  I watched it until I couldn’t see it anymore. I couldn’t tell the shape of the object but my first instinct tells me it might have been a cylinder type shape, but I cannot say for sure.  This was very strange and I have never seen anything like it. I did see an airplane shortly after (2 minutes or so) and it seemed to be heading in the same general direction, but did not appear to be chasing it.  The plane seemed to be a coincidence and did not seem to be associated or even aware it was ahead of it.;39.1666;-108.723
I saw a bright light moving fast over the sky when all of a sudden it stopped and then disappeared.;2018-06-18 20:45:00;15 seconds;I saw a bright light moving fast over the sky when all of a sudden it stopped and then disappeared. I was travelling west when I saw a bright light.  I looked closer thinking it was an aircraft but then the object stopped.  I looked closer and then it moved backwards and suddenly disappeared.;39.1666;-108.723
Object was bright and flew off faster than anything.;2018-07-16 20:00:00;10 seconds;Object was bright and flew off faster than anything. I was going to the store, when a light caught my eye. I looked at it, assuming it was an airplane. But when I paid more attention to it, I realized that there was no noise. I looked at it for about 5 seconds, and then the object flew backwards and flew off faster than anything I've ever seen.;39.1666;-108.723
Fleet of UFO's witnessed in small town, Colorado;2021-05-06 22:13:00;2 minutes;Fleet of UFO's witnessed in small town, Colorado At 10:15 PM I stepped outside to have a smoke on my deck. I looked to the North West, I couldn't help but look that direction because there was a whole string of bright white lights heading North East. There was no doubt in my mind what I was seeing, I knew. A fleet of UFO's. There was no sound, and they moved in precise order. And they just kept coming. Once they got farther North East, they just simply disappeared. I guessed maybe 50, but I don't know how many I missed before I got outside. Tried to video it but I was shaking so bad, I hit video on phone and forgot to hit play. Dang it. Probably a once in a lifetime event. Quite scarry, to see so many.;39.1666;-108.723
