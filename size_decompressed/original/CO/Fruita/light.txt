Light over Fruita, Colorado;2009-09-02 05:10:00;40 seconds;Light over Fruita, Colorado I was refueling the forklift at work, when I looked up and saw this bright light orange color light in the sky. Traveling in a southeaster, direction. The light appears to be accelerating for a moment than slowing down the next. Also it appears to have a jerking motion as it moved. I lost sight of the light as it slowly dim and disappear in the dark sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.1666;-108.723
Saw 5 lights or glowing orange yellow and red orbs lights you could say for about 15 mins;2012-01-06 19:45:00;15 mins;saw 5 lights or glowing orange yellow and red orbs lights you could say for about 15 mins Me and my friend were standing out side of the house and we saw the first one at around 7:45 pm and we saw five altogether it was about 15 or so mins that we saw all five.  They were yellow orange and red and they all looked adout the same. And there was air plains in the sky at that time.  Ok the first and second one went from left to right at different times and they didn't go straight but same direction. Then two came up from the monument from what i and my friend could tell and went up and disappeared into thin air like the ones befor it. And then a couple mins latter another popped up and did the same as the last two and vanished. None of them went straight just kind of went in that direction. It was amazing. Never saw anything like it;39.1666;-108.723
