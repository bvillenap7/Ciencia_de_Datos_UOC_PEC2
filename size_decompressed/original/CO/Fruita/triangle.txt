Possible drone?;1983-04-07 00:00:00;15 minutes;Possible drone? A Bright Gold looking star came out above the Colorado National Monument.  It came up and then floated from the Monument half way between a plane above and the earth below.  When It flew it looked like a golden triangle with a fish tail appearance behind it and blinking goldish auburn looking 2 blinking lights.  It flew easterly towards the Grand Junction, Co airport.  Within 5 minutes I saw another one in the west direction heading towards Moab, Utah.;39.1666;-108.723
