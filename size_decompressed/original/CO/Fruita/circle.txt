Huge, orange orbs over Colorado National Monument;2011-07-24 21:15:00;4 Minutes;Huge, Orange Orbs over Colorado National Monument At approximately 9:15 I went out to collect my mail.  I spotted a large, orange, orb over the Colorado National Monument traveling from the West heading East.  It was a huge bright light, and bright orange color and moving very slow.  I knew it was not a plain.  I ran into the house and grabbed my binoculars to get a better view.  This bright orange orb had 4 or 5 smaller lights blinking all around it, not attached to it, but in it's proximity.  Then, it drifted into the tree line and I could not see it anymore.   But just as soon as I lost sight of it, another one appeared out of no where.  Same as the first, large, bright orange, traveling from the West heading East, and many blinking lights all around it.   As I was watching it the other one appeared again for a short time and then just blinked out. And then to my surprise the visible one dropped straight down the front of the Monument. I followed it down with my binoculars until I could not see it anymore because o! f neighborhood roof tops.;39.1666;-108.723
