Three silent, black triangle craft flew over and did a loop in a formation before flying over the mountains.;2020-05-12 12:05:00;2 minutes;Three silent, black triangle craft flew over and did a loop in a formation before flying over the mountains. A friend and I were sitting outside on the deck for lunch.  I looked up and saw three triangle craft flying in a tight formation through the clouds directly over us.  We watched as they flew North and did a loop as a formation at a lower altitude below the clouds.  They each looked similar to a B-2 bomber but not with the same points in the middle rear of the craft. They looked like just a flying wing and they were black with a little brown underneath. When they did the loop they turned to a shiny, white color in the sun and then back to black as they completed the loop.  They stayed very close to each other but were moving around as they flew.  Their flight characteristics were different than any jet I had ever seen flying before though still similar with a general forward direction.  They seemed to be shaky and slightly erratic.  After the loop they descended and broke formation slightly and then flew North until we could no longer see them.  We never heard any je! t engine or other noises and they did not leave a contrail or exhaust.  The whole sighting lasted less than two minutes.;40.0747;-105.9314
Dancing UFOs.;2020-07-30 12:27:00;5 minutes;Dancing UFOs. Aircraft came in from the south began to fly in a dance like pattern rotating around each other.  Danced around and then proceeded to go under the cloud and after several minutes of Dance moved towards the Northwest at a constant speed and in a straight course.  In the middle of the video an object can be seen traveling at an extremely high speed Crossing directly past the three described ships.;40.0747;-105.9314
