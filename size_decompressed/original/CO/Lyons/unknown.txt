strange humming noise over house late at night;1997-11-02 02:20:00;2 to 4 minutes;strange humming noise over house late at night On this night at 2:20 AM my wife and daughter were woke up by a massive humming noise right over our house - it also slightly shook the house. I was apparently awakened by the noise too, but did not fully gain full consciousness until it ceased and so I did not know what it was that had woke me. My wife walked into my daughters room and they both listened to it together. The sound seemed to move from above the house from the east and moved slowly over the house and then more quickly away from the house toward the west.  I did not post this account in 1997 because I had already posted another account about a UFO and felt that it would sound unbelievable that so many events were happening to us. But I recently noted another person’s account on this site about a like event at 3:50 AM on 11/7/04 in Ashburn, VA. Our account was much like that one except we saw no special light. However on 11/9/97 (a few days after the first event) my wife was woke out of sleep by a light shining in her face – but this time with no noise. Also, later on, a small lamp in our room came on by itself and caused her to wake up again.  What I found interesting is that from 11/2/97 till 11/7/2004 is 7 X 366 days. And from 11/9/97 until 11/7/04 is 7 X 356 days.;40.2337;-105.3233
