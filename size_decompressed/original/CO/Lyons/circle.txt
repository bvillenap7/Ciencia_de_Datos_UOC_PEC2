A round, bright white, low flying object with a blurred edge hovers over a nearby mountain, darts around and then out of sight.;2015-01-18 06:15:00;1 minute;A round, bright white, low flying object with a blurred edge hovers over a nearby mountain, darts around and then out of sight. At 6:15a.m., I looked out from my bedroom window, at the mountain, approximately 1/2 mile from my home.  There looked to be a large search-light against the mountain.  I thought, That is the biggest searchlight, I've ever seen.   It appeared to be a large round white light, approximately the size of three houses placed together.  It darted against the mountain from left to right.  I thought it was strange that someone was searching for something in an erratic fashion.   It then lifted above the mountain line and appeared as a bright and round with a blurred edge, as it was while in front of the mountain.   Since there were no clouds in the sky, it occurred to me that it was not reflecting off of clouds, if in fact it was a large spotlight.   Then, it darted to the west a short distance, paused for a moment and abruptly took off going east in the sky. Then, it was gone.;40.2337;-105.3233
