Two High School Girls see silver disk move over town;1997-08-29 18:30:00;2 minutes;Summary : Two High School Girls see silver disk move over town My daughters were at the High School playing field about 45 minutes before the start of a Football game when they looked up and saw a disk about the size of a dime held at arms length, (lower than the low clouds) move from the NE to the SW to W direction.  It moved slowly and the setting sun caused it to reflect light very brightly like an object of very smooth metal or glass.  The shape was that of a disk with a slight indentation in the center. It made no noise.  They have never seen anything like it before and did not really believe stories I had told them of UFOs I had seen before their birth.   I report this because I note that other sightings are being seen in the Wyo.& Colo. area.  I also may have seen another one myself on about 8/4/97 just at sunrise, also over Lyons.  It too was reflecting the sun very brightly.  I kept it to myself because I did not see its shape.  It too made no sound though it was not very high over town and traveled N to S.;40.2337;-105.3233
