In the photos you can see the moon,at the top of the photo. It is a little blurry in the scan picture,The Larger photos are from the telescope. I had my camera checked,even though I was using two different cameras. The camera had no problems, I had these pictures taken to a camera shop,and looked at. The photo paper was good. He did not know what it was,I even had a astronomer look at them he said it was ball lighting. So I went out last summer in a lighting storm and set my camera on time laps and all the photo had light streaks in them.;40.2337;-105.3233
