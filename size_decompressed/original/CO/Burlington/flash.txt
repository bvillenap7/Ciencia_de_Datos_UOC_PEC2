We had been driving through a snowstorm it was still snowing so we didn't feel that it could have been lightning we saw nothing like lightning, only heard a gigantic wave of sound similar to the thunder accompanied by lightning, then saw the entire horizon light up in a bright purple hue.  My 3 children and I were just getting off of I-70 west heading to a Denny's at which the waitress admitted she had been witness to the same.;39.3133;-102.2614

We wondered if it was an explosion, some power lines having fallen or something, but saw nothing afterwards such as fire or emergency vehicles.   When we arrived at the Denny's shortly thereafter, the waitress admitted she had witnessed the exact same phenomenon.;39.3133;-102.2614
