Am aircraft with 2 cyan thrustsers came out of nowhere and headed north and then disappeared;2020-04-03 22:45:00;2 seconds;Am aircraft with 2 cyan thrustsers came out of nowhere and headed north and then disappeared My girlfriend and I were looking out into the city and in the corner of our eyes, we see a triangular aircraft with 2 cyan/green-blueish circular lights that appeared to be its thrusters.  This only lasted for 1 to 2 seconds then it completely disappeared.  We noticed that our porch lights went extremely dim as well when we first sighted it, but after the object had disappeared they returned to normal.  We also noticed that there was a duck prior to the sighting that kept quacking.  As soon as the object appeared, the duck stopped quacking for a bit, and when it disappeared, it started to quack again.  It was like something out of a movie.;39.948859685864;-104.816636125655
