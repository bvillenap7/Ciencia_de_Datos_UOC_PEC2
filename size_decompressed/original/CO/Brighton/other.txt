Craft with lights hovering over houses at night;2006-10-06 22:30:00;15 seconds;Craft with lights hovering over houses at night I was on Bridge St. in Brighton (medium sized town north of denver) when I saw an aircraft moving through the sky. It was about 10:30 at night.  I thought it was a plane, but then realized it was much too low, and also moving too slow.  It was only 10-20 feet above some houses.  It had green blinking lights on it, but I couldn't identify the shape.  There were maybe a dozen small lights, and also one larger white/yellow light. As I drove past, it lowered behind the trees and possibly landed.  It was in sight for about 15 seconds.  I wish I had gone to look closer at it but frankly I was little freaked out. This was a UFO, in that I couldn't identify what it was.  My first impression was that it was one of those flight for life helicopters.  I'm not positive that isn't what it was.  But it just seemed too big and didn't look right.  I'm sure the people in that area had to have seen it.  I am about 50% sure it was a flight-for-life, because that's my only explanation, but it just didn't seem like it.;39.948859685864;-104.816636125655
