Very bright flashing in a pattern of red, white, green, but mostly bright light.;2010-08-27 22:30:00;at lest 45 min;Very bright flashing in a pattern of red, white, green, but mostly bright light. Watching from patio due west and another north west.  Not moving - just flashing very brightly then dimming then brightly.  We are star gazers almost every night(also worked for an airline and know a plane when we see one), but this is unlike anything we have ever seen in the sky.  It's been 45 minutes and they are both there. Very strange indeed.;39.948859685864;-104.816636125655
3 white round objects moving NE over Brighton, CO, this morning.;2016-05-25 09:00:00;3-5 minutes;3 white round objects moving NE over Brighton, CO, this morning. While relaxing in my backyard, just sitting with my head back and looking up at the planes going over, I spotted 3 white circular objects moving fast, not in a straight line.  Two of these were sort of together, and the other was off about 1/2 mile--all moving N, NE over Thornton, and Brighton, CO.   The duration was about 3-5 minutes.  There was one or two large planes up in the sky (don't know which airline) probably not more than a mile away from these objects.   My mouth was hanging open the whole time and I did not have sense enough to go in and get my iphone to take pictures, but I called this in to our local Denver 9 news, but they had not received any other reports, as of the time I called them.;39.948859685864;-104.816636125655
