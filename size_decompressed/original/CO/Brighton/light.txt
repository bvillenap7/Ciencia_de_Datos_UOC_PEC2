Zigzagging Object during meteor shower;2007-08-12 23:45:00;15 Seconds;Zigzagging Object during meteor shower It was the night of the meteor shower and I was laying in bed watching out my window. Out of the corner of my eye I saw what at first I thought was a star, then maybe an airplane. It was pretty high up and was doing little tiny zigzags. It didnâ€™t get any brighter, but it was moving slowly. After a few moments it passed over the house where I could no longer see it.;39.948859685864;-104.816636125655
Bright white and orange light in western sky.;2010-09-14 20:15:00;20 minutes;Bright white and orange light in western sky. It was about 8:15pm mountain time Sept. 14, 10, and I went to look out my back door because I thought I heard something outside.  When I looked to the west southwest, I saw a bright white light in the trees.  I ran to get a pair of binoculars and when I returned, it was gone.  So I watched to see if it would return and it did, but this time it had moved to the right of the trees and was an orange color, then it blinked out.  Then I saw it again and it was white and orange in color, but now was back in the trees, and then it blinked out again.  It kept doing this for about 20 minutes.  The last time it appeared was just left of the trees and it was a very bright white light and then it blinked out and that was it.  There was no sound either from the object.;39.948859685864;-104.816636125655
Me and 2 other friends noticed 2 orange lights coming towards our direction.    ((anonymous report));2018-02-17 20:56:00;2 minutes;Was walking back from the liquor store when me and 2 other friends noticed 2 orange lights coming towards our direction.   At first we thought they were drones, but then they went higher and faded away at a fast pace...one disappeared first, then the other, but the orange lights became brighter before fading out like a candle with a low flame.  It was the craziest thing ive seen in my life! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.948859685864;-104.816636125655
Observed single white light stationary in sky during heavy rain and hail storm.  ((NUFORC Note:  Pilot report.  PD));2018-06-18 21:45:00;~3 minutes;Observed single white light stationary in sky during heavy rain and hail storm. UFO Report June 18, 2018.  I live in Brighton, Colorado, and tonight I was home on my front porch which faces west watching a heavy rain and small hail storm at about 9:45 PM, which occured about half an hour after the first heavy hail storm which contained literally golf ball and larger sized hail, which I have heard of and seen pictures of, but never in person until tonight. While observing the completely overcast night sky to the west, I saw a single white light at about a 35 Degree elevation directly west of my location.  It didn't pulse or flash or change color.  It didn't come closer or move further away or up or down or to one side or the other.  It remained visible for 2 to 3 minutes in the same place.  It only seemed to wobble or move slightly in a random manner and increased and decreased in apparent brightness until it slowly dimmed and completely faded from view and did not reappear. I don't know what it was, but I know what it wasn't.  It wasn't a fixed wing airplane because it didn't move.  It wasn't a helicopter because no helicopter could operate in, or just below, the clouds in such weather.  It wasn't a star or planet because the sky was completely obscured. We live about 12 miles straight distance from DIA (Denver International Airport) where I work for a major airline.  I am very familiar with the aircraft flight patterns over my house.  This light did not conform to any flight pattern I would expect to see. I am an aircraft mechanic and private pilot with over 30 years experience working on and flying in aircraft begining with obtaining my private pilot's licence in 1987 and flying on Navy P-3 Orion sub hunter aircraft in 1989.  I have seen several anomalous things in the sky over the years but have never felt so compelled to report them as this time because there is no prosaic explanation I can think of to dismiss this.;39.948859685864;-104.816636125655
