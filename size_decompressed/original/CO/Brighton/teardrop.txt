My husband and I were sitting outside this evening around 18:10 Mountain time taking in the cool autumn air when my husband looked up and seen a bright white light with  a short tail.  I looked up as well and saw the same thing.  It was teardrop shaped and glidding along pretty fast.  My father is a pilot and I learned enough to know from him that the object was not a military jet, airliner, hellicopter, or small airplane. There was no sound what so ever from this object.  We watched it for a good 45 seconds to about a minute.  We know that it was not a ameter cause it was moving too slow to be a meter. The object was heading west from the east.;39.948859685864;-104.816636125655
