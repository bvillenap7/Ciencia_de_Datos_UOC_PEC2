This event occurred in a rural, acreage, sub-division, near the town of Brighton, Colorado, on Sept. 21, 2006. I am located in Adams County, and approximately 1 mile north of a large lake, called Barr Lake. I went to my horse barn to check on a sick horse at 9:00pm and noticed a large circle of lights very low in the sky. I thought at first it was a spotlight advertisement from town, so didn't think much of it, until I started walking toward my house, and the lights followed and remained over my house until they dissapeared at approximately 10:00pm. To the best of my knowledge,the whole configuration was about one-half the size of a football field and consisted of four lights rotating in a circle or slightly oval pattern. They were spaced evenly apart and would rotate once and then all go into the center and touch, and very quickly go out again and rotate. This pattern was repeated over and over during the whole veiwing. I would estimate the constant speed of the circles to be about 40mph or faster. Two of my neighbors also witnessed the event. It was very overcast at the time. There was no noise or sound from the lights. I am located about 7 miles from Denver International Airport. I did call them this monring to see if anything showed on radar. They were going to check. I also called the police about 9:50pm last night. The lights suddenly disappeared, and I did not see how the object left the area, as I had gone into the house to get the phone. I stepped back outside and it was gone, approximately at 10:00pm, Sept. 21, 2006. It seemed interested in my movements, as the lights were rotating, but the whole configuration stayed in the same spot while I was working with my horse,for about 30 minutes, near a very well-lit barn. It was only when I started walking toward my house that the configuration also begin moving toward my house and stopped again while over the top of the house, and remained there until it disappeared.;39.948859685864;-104.816636125655
