In 1974 with a bright clear sky, me, my brother and 2 other friends watched a light zip in and stop above us in the sky. It then in a blink of an eye shot straight across the sky and stopped. It then dropped straight down in a blink of an eye. From there it shot back across the sky and stopped directly under where it first stopped. It then shot straight up to complete a perfect rectangle. From that point is shot back out into outer space so fast that you could barely see the light trail from where it left. I would say this object was moving at the speed of light. The human eye could not follow it from point to point. These points were not close they covered a wide area in the sky. It turned out that my oldest brother and a couple his friends witnessed the same thing from a different part of town. I swear to God there is nothing on earth that can move as fast as this object did. And the fact that it formed a perfect rectangle proves to me we are not alone. I guarantee that every one of us that seen this will be able to pass any lie detector test you want to shove at us. Just an amazing sight.;40.9441;-102.3847
