I immediately noticed two blue pulsating orbs that seemed to come at great speed and then slow over adjacent field.  As I continued to observe said pulsating orbs I began to notice a latticed clear sheath surrounding them.  First orb once nearly 3/4 of a mile away seemed to take off at 40 degree angle, second orb barrel rolled and returned to my vehicle, hovering approximately 200ft away & 80ft above the ground, pulsating as a heart does.  I then began to notice a large clear sheath extending from orb with orb pulsating on on one side.  I can only describe it as a large hovering jellyfish that seemed to be alive.   Two men were outside a pickup about a half mile back.  Sighting was absolutely other worldly & I slowly drove away.;39.134775;-103.7866
