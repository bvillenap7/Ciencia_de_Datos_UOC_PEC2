((anonymous report));2016-06-05 22:30:00;5 minutes;My wife and I saw a circle object that looked like a star moving northwest.  As it moved across the sky it got really bright two different times.  Then it looked like it stopped and then just disappeared.   We have no idea what it was.   On another night, about a month ago, we saw two objects in the same area of the sky that looked like stars but they were moving really fast then disappeared.
