Yellow Light with trail of sparks arcing across the sky;2011-06-10 21:00:00;30 seconds or so;Yellow Light with trail of sparks arcing across the sky Me and my friend were driving to my house, and along the road, I had looked up, and i saw what looked like a plane with a trail.  But the trail could have been my bad vision blurring the light into something else.  But then it started shooting a trail of sparks like a firework, and i turned to my friend and I told him to look up and see it too.  and he did and he saw it as well.  It was a more yellow light, rather than a white light.  And we thought it could have just been a firework, but then it started making a perfect arc in one direction, then turned and went upwards making another perfect ark.   We then got out of the house, and the sky sounded completely silent. At this point we started freaking out and considering our options.  Was it a jet that caught fire and was crashing? A new type of fire work?  But it looked like it was directly above Denver. We drove past a few houses and trees that blocked our sight from it.  And before i knew it it was gone. The trail coming off of the light was maybe seven sparks long at first, but then it grew in length to about possibly twenty sparks.  It almost looked like something was cutting a hole in the sky with an angle grinder.  But obviously it wasn't.  Hope this information is useful.;39.9789;-105.1456
