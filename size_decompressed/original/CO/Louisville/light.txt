I looked up and saw three bright lights. They were slowly moving up and down. They were not planes or helicopters because they kept moving up and down. I looked away for a minute. When I looked back one had disappeared. This kept happening until the last one disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  Possible hoax, we believe.

White light grew in size and disappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from Iridium satellite??  PD));2011-06-23 22:19:00;5 seconds;White light grew in size and disappeared. I was taking my dog out before bed when I heard this loud airplane roaring above, so I looked up in the sky and saw this solid white light passing near the plane.  All of a sudden it grew about 5 times in size for about 2 seconds, turned a light bluish color and then shrank until I couldnâ€™t see it anymore.  The strange thing is it appeared to be traveling away from earth not north, south, east or west. It was a clear night sky and lots of stars were out.
