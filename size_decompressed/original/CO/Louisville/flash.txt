Directly overhead a single very strong bright white flash the size of an average star but very bright and distinct.  Only one flash, a point of light, not the whole sky, waited a decent amount of time to make sure it was not an aircraft or rotating space junk satellite.   Perfectly clear sky, no haze, no clouds, not lightning.   This is the fourth time I have seen this.  Last three sightings were 3 weeks ago at approximately the same time, all the same night within 60 seconds there were 3 flashes.  Perfectly clear sky, no haze, no clouds, not lightning. 2 witnesses on the previous sighting.;39.9789;-105.1456
