There was this bright light about one mile from the car and it was really high in the air. Then it quickly dropped super fast, like racing fast. As it got closer we realized that it was not a airplane or helicopter. It was way to circle to be that. Then it went to the right super fast and came towards us. Then we got a back view of it, and it had flashing lights! Theres our story!;40.637;-102.8688
