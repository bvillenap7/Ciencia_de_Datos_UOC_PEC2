Strange Lights in the Sky  Over Colorado   October 1, 2006;2006-10-01 23:15:00;10 seconds;Strange Lights in the Sky  Over Colorado   October 1, 2006 My husband and I were driving to our home in Pueblo West, Colorado at about 11:15 pm and  were turning  from south to west.   I happened to look up in the sky  and saw 5 or 6 bright spheres  in a line formation  racing from one cloud  to  another.    I  couldn't believe my eyes and  shouted to my husband to stop, telling him what I was seeing.  He was driving and couldn't  see above the car but  when he stopped, I jumped out and saw the spheres disappear behind a cloud.   There were no sounds  at the time I saw  the spheres, and they were too large to be airplanes.   They were travelling at a very fast speed, nothing like I have ever seen in the sky before.   There were no blinking lights and I do not believe it was an aircraft of this world. They were travelling so fast there was a glow  behind them.  I think they were travelling faster than light.    by the time we reached our driveway,  my husband heard 5 loud explosions,  which we later learned  were heard by our neighbors (the sounds woke them up).    This is my first UFO sighting.;38.387;-104.7792
ORANGE FIREWORK SPHERE W/ TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER HOVERED IN PW 7 MINUTES, SILENTLY, THEN DISAPPEARED;2012-09-19 23:25:00;7 minutes;ORANGE &quotFIREWORK&quot SPHERE W/ TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER HOVERED IN PW 7 MINUTES, SILENTLY, THEN DISAPPEARED 1 bright orange sphere looked exactly like a frozen firework in the sky above Platteville. With binoculars you could clearly see a bright orange triangle in the center of all these smaller orange lights, point up. It flickered at first rose up... hovered 6 minutes, and disappeared. Also it was completely silent. No noise AT ALL. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, Thank you for the interest, I'm still very excited about what I saw about a block in a half from my home,i I was crawling in bed and looked out my bedroom window to the north, and behind a house there was this flickering orange light, like the house may have been on fire, which is what I originally thought, so bright it illuminated the sky all around that house. This sphere rose up past the profile of the house, and very clearly hovered there, If you can imagine a frozen, elevated, hovering, firework. As if it were shot off then froze. it was very clear. the orange lights were illuminating from the orange sphere itself, and in the center like  I said, a triangle, fiery orange as well, but clear through binoculars... Like an orange being held in the sky, with orange lights all around the outside, not like a ring, ALL OVER, like lightbulbs almost, not spinning....and i could see through to the center, the triangle..I even went oputside and stood on a lawn chair in the yard to get a better look.. Im seeing it clearly, then blackness. The binaculars are 16 x 32..188 ft, at 1000 yards. it was CLEAR                                                                                                    ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));38.387;-104.7792
