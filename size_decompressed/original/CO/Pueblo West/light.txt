4-5 bright whitish-orange lights in Pueblo West, Colorado on 10/1/06 at 11:30 p.m.;2006-10-01 23:30:00;5 minutes;4-5 bright whitish-orange lights in Pueblo West, Colorado on 10/1/06 at 11:30 p.m. It was fairly bright outside, as we had a pretty big and bright moon that evening.  As a matter of fact, that was the first thing I noticed when I turned onto Boyero Road, the moon was really beautiful and the clouds were kind of flowing over it.  As I was coming off my road and heading west on Boyero, I noticed five bright, whitish, orange lights moving from south to north, towards Colorado Springs, Colorado.  They were about the size of big headlights.  I stopped my vehicle right away and got out, as they were coming directly at me.  There was one out in front, two others above and below, and then another behind the two middle ones with 3-4 smaller redish, orange lights directly behind. I thought it was a meteor, but it was not moving towards the earth, it was moving in a perfectly straight line about 100 feet or so above me at a very, very, high rate of speed.  What made it really creepy was there was no sound, no sound at all, it was dead silent outside.  The area is very rural and you usually at least hear crickets, but it was dead silent outside, no crickets, no dogs barking, no breeze or wind, absolutely nothing at all.  It was dead still.  The one light right after the main first light would move up and down slightly and then would speed up slightly to almost catch the first light but then it would back off and go back to formation so to speak.  They seemed to appear out of nowhere and right after they passed by me, they were heading north-east and just simply disappeared.  It was that fast.;38.387;-104.7792
10-15 very bright lights, stationary and some moving very slowly, up, down, right and left.;2014-07-05 23:00:00;10-20 minutes;10 - 15 very bright lights, stationary and some moving very slowly, up, down, right and left. We went out on our patio, which faces west.  We looked to the south and there were very bright lights against the mountains, which are about 20-30 miles away.  There are only 2 very small towns in that area and we normally see no lights from there. The lights in the center of the group were in a narrow pyramid shape.  There were several lights on each side, outside of the pyramid.  At first, we thought they were all stationary, but as we watched, some of them would move to the right, left, up or down VERY slowly.  There was no color and no sound.  There was a cloud above and off to the right of the lights and they, one or two at a time, moved up and to the right until they disappeared behind the cloud.;38.387;-104.7792
