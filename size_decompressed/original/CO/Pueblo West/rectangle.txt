RED LASER COMING OUT OF A RECTANGULAR CRAFT!;2002-10-04 21:30:00;about 10 seconds;RED LASER COMING OUT OF A RECTANGULAR CRAFT! My friend and I were driving home at 9:30 when I saw a bright red laser out of the corner of my eye.  I yelled at my friend Look, do you see that!.  I pulled the car over to get a better look.  When I got out of the car, The laser started again but this time it just kinda kept flashing like it was broken or something, but it kinda had a pattern to it.  While it was flashing, I followed the laser with my eyes up through a cloud it went through and I could see that it was coming out of a rectangle shaped craft.  It eventually stopped, and I kept on going home.  About two minutes later, a friend called my cell phone saying that he saw the same light from his house.  Um, about the contact info, my dad works for the government and I'm not allowed to disclose that info. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain semi-anonymous.
