It then separated vertically into two separate lights, and then reconnected together. It ultimately disappeared.  The lights just faded out.  Total sighting was approximately three minutes. There is a lot of haze in the sky, because of fires in the western part of the state.  This light was clear and easily seen in the sky, even with the haze.
