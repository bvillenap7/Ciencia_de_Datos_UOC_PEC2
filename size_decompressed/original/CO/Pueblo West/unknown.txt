Lights Over Lake Pueblo travel past the North Star;2010-03-20 22:00:00;20 minutes;Lights Over Lake Pueblo travel past the North Star I lived in Pueblo West from 2002 to 2016. In Early spring 2010 at about 10pm I went onto my back porch and looked at the stars which I do often. In the sky over Lake Pueblo at close to a 60 degree angle, I noticed what looked like extra stars. There was one large bright light with three smaller less bright lights.  I watched this for several minutes because I knew they didnâ€™t belong there.  As I watched them, they started to move towards the North Star.  The large light was in front with the other three equal distances around. I watched them fly at a steady pace for fifteen minutes until they disappeared into outer space past the North Star.;38.387;-104.7792
