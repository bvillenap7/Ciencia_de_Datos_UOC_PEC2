A red laser-like light came out of a cloud...;2002-10-04 21:30:00;About 4 seconds;A red laser-like light came out of a cloud... I was walking home from a friend's house at about 9:30 that night.  While I was turning a corner, a very brief (like just a split second) red laser like light went through a small cloud, turning the cloud an erie red color.  The light stopped for about two seconds, then resumed again, but this time it flashed (kind of like morse code) for about five more seconds.  If any of you people out there know morse code, it would have looked somewhat like this on paper ( -....--...---..----. ).  I was down wind from the light, and a small breeze brought kind of a sulfer like smell with it, but I'm not quite sure if that was due to the light.;38.387;-104.7792
Intense red light, spinning rapidly, droning sound.;2003-10-02 22:15:00;10-15 seconds;Intense red light, spinning rapidly, droning sound. I live on the North Side of Pueblo West, people who live out here know how wide open it is and how dark it gets there at night.  Me and my friend were on our way home from a party, I was driving his truck because he was plastered, and right after we turned on my street, I noticed a red glare on the dash board, the light steadily became more intense as the seconds passed.  I watched my friend look out the window, his eyes got all wide, and he pulled the Mini Cougar (Berreta Pistol) he keeps in his glove compartment and pointed it out the window, I kind of swerved because i wasn't watching what I was doing because I was trying to keep him from shooting at anything, then I watched the lights  speed up, until i could see them in front of us, they started spinning so fast that they looked like a big red band, there was no sound till it started spinning, there was a loud like droning sound, then it was gone.;38.387;-104.7792
