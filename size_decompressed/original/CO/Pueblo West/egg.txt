White-yellow egg shaped object moving in a NW direction over Pueblo CO.;2009-07-07 21:05:00;5 Minutes;White-yellow egg shaped object moving in a NW direction over Pueblo, CO. My girlfriend and I were on an evening walk in our neighborhood when we stopped for a smoke.  While we were sitting there, I noticed a light coming out of the south and pointed it out to my girlfriend.  We both watched as this light slowly traveled in a NE direction.  At one point, when it was at its closest to us, another plane was flying over the light (could easily make out FAA lights on it).  The object was a solid light, about the size of a grain of rice at arms length.  I thought the color was white while my girlfriend thought it had yellow around it.  As it approached and was heading away, the light it put out was steady and solid.   My girlfriend thinks it was more of an egg shape, I seem to think it was more oval.  The sighting lasted about 5 mintues.   Its altitude is unknown, but it appeared lower than the airliner that flew over it.  At first I thought is was a Sat. or the ISS, but it was too large to be a sat. and to low to be the ISS.;38.387;-104.7792
