I then noticed an object just behind the Jetstream that appeared to be heading south towards us since the object was getting slightly larger.  When I pointed it out to my neighbor, it got extremely bright then instantly shot west bound with no light and looked diamond in shape. It slowed over the airliner, then got very bright again and took off at twice the speed of the aircraft and disappeared into the sky.;39.5037;-107.667
