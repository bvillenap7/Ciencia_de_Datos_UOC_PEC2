My father and I were outside looking at a clear night sky.  Suddenly, we saw this light moving at a moderate speed across the night sky heading Northeast.  We knew it could not be a plane, satellite, or falling star because the flight path was very eradict.   The light kept moving at a zig-zag pattern from west to east will continue to go towards the northeast.   We both watched the object for 10 minutes before it finally moved out of our sight range. My father is a former state policeman from South Dakota and has had many sightings in the past.  My mothers youngest sister was also abducted when she was 5 years old.
