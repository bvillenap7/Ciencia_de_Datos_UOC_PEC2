Three lights in a triangle that flew off in opposite directions at an amazing speed in Northern Colorado.;2012-12-04 19:00:00;4 minutes;Three lights in a triangle that flew off in opposite directions at an amazing speed in Northern Colorado. On the evening Tuesday December 4th I was driving home from Fort Collins Colorado to my house near Nunn, Colorado.  It was approximately 7pm.  I was on Weld County Road 100, approximately half way between Wellington and Nunn Colorado. I glanced to the south and saw three strange lights in the sky.  They looked a bit like stars in the sky but were much brighter, and there were not many stars visible at that time.  The lights were arranged in a triangle pattern. My first thought was it was just the lights of the large radio towers south of my house.  (Weld County road 27 and Weld County Road 90).  I was driving so I pulled over to the side of the road.  Once I was stopped I was able locate the red lights of the radio tower and they were NOT the three mysterious lights that I was seeing.  The lights were higher in the sky and further west then the radio tower lights. I watched the lights and I was trying to grasp what they could be.  Nothing in my mind fit what I was seeing.  They were not stars, they were not earthly aircraft.  As I stared with amazement the lights, which had been stationary in the sky, spun in the sky together in a circular motion two full revolutions then the three lights took off in different directions from each other.  The speed at which they exited my view was faster than anything I have ever witnessed. I waited about 2 minutes to see if I could see them again.  I did not.  I am not sure what it is that I was looking at, and I have done some simple google searches to see if there others that may have witnesses what I did.  I have found nothing.;40.7246;-104.7827
