Unusual orange-gold light in southern sky;2000-02-26 19:20:00;7 minutes;Unusual orange-gold light in southern sky My wife and I were southbound from the community of McClave when I noticed what appeared to be a orange-gold light directly south of the intersection of Colo Hwy 196 & U.S. Hwy 50. The light was approximately 20 degrees above the south horizon on an overcast sky. The light grew in intensity for 3 seconds then went out. 15 seconds later it light back up quickly then went out. There were no other lights such as running lights on an aircraft. The light came back on 1 mile west of the first location lit up for 1 second 3 times then off. 1.5 miles west it lit back up 2 times for 1.5 seconds. Always a orange-gold color. No other aircraft were seen in the area.;38.0822;-102.8873
