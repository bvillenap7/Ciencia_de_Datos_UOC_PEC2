Gold lime green irregular bulb-shaped object Broomfield, CO 5:30PM  9/27/11;2011-09-27 17:30:00;25 MINUTES;gold lime green irregular bulb-shaped object Broomfield, CO 5:30PM  9/27/11 On September 27, 2011, at about 5:30pm, I was sitting on my back patio, in Broomfield, Colorado, which is about ¼ mile east of Highway 287 and W. 10th Avenue.  Several small planes were making approaches from the north to land at Metropolitan Airport, two miles to the southwest.  While watching these planes, I noticed something about three times higher in the air.  It was the shape of a lightbulb, if the aluminum-wrapped lower base section were cut off.  It glowed gold-ish lime green.  It was moving from east to west very slowly. I went indoors and got my binoculars and watched the object through them.  A few times, it left its east-west course and veered in a northerly direction.  Then, it would go west for awhile, then, veer south before continuing westward. Initially, I thought this might be a Mylar balloon, but it did not look like one.  Also, they tend to be highly reflective.  This, instead, seemed to be glowing from within, a greenish gold color, not shiny or reflective. Then, I wondered if it were a bundle of helium balloons, but with the binoculars, I could not see any irregularity in the shape, or space between balloons where they would separate from one another.  It looked like one cohesive whole.  Its shape did not change. When it was overhead, it began moving in a more distinctly northerly direction, still going westward.  From this angle, it looked as if it had a red elongated vertical light in the very center of it, the shape of a candle wick.  This “wick” looked as if it extended about 2/3 of the height of the object.  It still glowed greenish gold around this long red central “wick.”  Also, when it got to the west of me, I thought perhaps it would not appear to be glowing (if its appearance were a matter of simply reflecting sunlight), since I would be on the side of the object that sunlight was not striking.  This was not the case, however, and the object did appear to be emitting the greenish gold color on the east side (away from the sun) as well. I watched this object for about 25 minutes.  There was quite a bit of air traffic to Metropolitan Airport (2 miles southwest) and to Denver International Airport, much further east.  The object was in fairly close proximity to two aircraft, so I am wondering if a pilot reported seeing it and could identify what it was.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Object with four flashing lights swoops over Broomfield houses.;2012-12-05 07:34:00;~1 minute;Object with four flashing lights swoops over Broomfield houses I was driving home after picking my girlfriend up for work when I noticed a large white vertical cylinder in hovering in the sky, and while I feel I could write an entire report about this incident, what followed drastically more entertaining.  As I was pulling closer to this object it started to flash, and before I could even get a camera ready to get some footage of it my girlfriend screaming out, &quotWhat the hell is that!?&quot   The object she saw was clearly a single bent saucer shape.  It had a row of four lights, with the two outside lights set slightly lower and to the side of the two in the middle.  It was incredibly low in the sky, lower than any of the planes which fly along a similar path from DIA.  The object was so low that I got a pretty good estimate of it's size, I'd say it was about 60' wide, about two houses. As soon as I saw it I turned onto a road that ran right underneath it to try to get some pictures or video of it, and as soon as I turned onto the road I saw the four lights grow brighter and the entire object just sort of swooped down over the houses and shot off towards the mountains.  I floored it to try to keep up with it, got up to over 60MPH in a residential zone trying to catch up to it and it still shot away from me like I was standing still.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Three strange lights in triangular formation, one brighter than any aircraft I have ever seen one passed overhead.;2014-01-17 18:00:00;10 minutes;Three strange lights in triangular formation, one brighter than any aircraft I have ever seen one passed overhead. I was driving home from Boulder on W 120th Avenue when I noticed 3 very peculiar lights to the southwest in a triangular formation.  One of the lights was very bright, brighter than any aircraft I have ever seen.  I continued to drive east for a few minutes when one of the objects passed several hundred feet overhead: I looked upwards and saw a craft that did not look like any aircraft I had ever seen with a very strange shape.  I had denied my having seen this craft and dismissed it as another human aircraft (an airport was a few miles to the southeast) until this evening when I discovered this website and watched Paul Hellyer's interview with Sophie Co.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Silver/metallic toroidal object seen tumbling northbound during daylight.;2020-08-08 19:50:00;15 minutes;Silver/metallic toroidal object seen tumbling northbound during daylight.   I'm an amateur astronomer and I was setting up my gear just before sundown.  When I glanced up at a plane that was leaving DIA, I noticed something else (naked eye) just north of the plane at a slightly higher altitude (~20k feet).   It looked like a shiny disk and was moving slowly due north.  I grabbed binoculars to get a closer look and I was able to see the object very clearly.  It wasn't a disk but rather toroid in shape and metallic silver.  It was tumbling as it moved north.  In diameter I would say it was approximately 100-200 feet.  The best description I can give would be a 100 foot diameter silver wedding ring being tossed in slow motion.  I grabbed my partner and gave her another pair of binos.  We just watched it for about 15 minutes until it was too far away to see with much clarity.  Because of its silver coloration I thought it might be a mylar research balloon of some kind, but I can't find any reference to such a thing online.  It had no visible lights of propulsion. ((BEGIN ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello, I submitted a report last week regarding a sighting I experienced in Broomfield, CO on August 9th.  I posted the wrong date for the sighting as it actually occurred on Saturday August 8th.  I'd just like to make the change in case anyone else witnessed the event on the same day.   Thanks, ((END ADDENDUM));39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
