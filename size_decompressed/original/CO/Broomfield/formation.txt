Three lights in row.;2011-01-25 17:15:00;15 to 20 min;Three lights in row. I headed east on Dillon Rd in Broomfield, co from 120th to Sheridan.  There were 2 lights in the sky about the size of a spotlight.  There was a third light that was very faint.  The light closest to me became smaller then headed south.  The second light after about 5 minutes also became smaller and followed the 1st light.  The 3rd light remained faint.  When the first light headed south it appeared to be in a cheveron shape and black.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Group of 7 red orbs, moving independently at different altitudes, were seen for 1 minute before they disappeared one-by-one;2016-01-03 19:20:00;1 minute;Group of 7 red orbs, moving independently at different altitudes, were seen for 1 minute before they disappeared one-by-one Started as 7 red orbs, with some low on the horizon and some up at small aircraft altitude.  The orbs moved independently and we certainly not planes...no flashing lights, etc.  We drove around the corner and saw the orbs, so no telling how long they were there.  However, we watched them for about one minute.  The orbs individually disappeared.   There was no sound, as they must have been 10 miles away.  It looks like the red lights on a radio tower, but there was no way there could have been a tower as tall as the highest orb and the orbs were moving from east to west.  They were viewed from Broomfield, Colorado, but were approximately 10 miles north. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above, and sent a note to the witness for confirmation.
