On 12/09/2010 2 of us were traveling east in a car on Highway 36 in Broomfield.  We looked to the south and noticed a large round very bright light in the sky.  The light was approximately 1/2 the size of a full moon.  The light was hovering over Rocky Mountain Airport in Jefferson County.  The light hovered for approximately 45 seconds, then a flash of lightning occured in the section where the light was seen, then the light and lightning were gone.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Broomfield;2011-03-20 20:25:00;15 min;Broomfield Saw 3 red lights in formation coming from the west, they slowly broke apart more and more and continued moving east.  One of the red lights started to break apart from the other 2 and then seemed to come lower down.  Then when I came back with my camera there were only 2.  Then in a blink, I looked down and they were all gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Bright light moving steadily over Broomfield disappears;2012-06-22 10:30:00;30-60 seconds;Bright light moving steadily over Broomfield disappears We stepped out on the back deck, to smoke a cigarette. Shortly after stepping out we looked up and noticed a bright light overhead. It appeared higher in altitude than an airplane, yet was too bright to be a satellite. It was moving quickly and steadily in a SSE direction. It did so for approximately 30 seconds. We watched the light and there was a period where one of us thought that the light was an airplane because it was witnessed that there was a blue and a red light on the right side. The light then changed to a bluish light and remained that way for only a few seconds. It then changed to a red light and became noticeably smaller and dimmer. It was that way for another few seconds and then disappeared. Another light not quite as bright appeared and flew for approximately 5 seconds across its path then disappeared.

Just after sunset as I was leaving the park I noticed a small ball of light moving east from the west.  It was moving about the speed of an airplane however the light was unlike any aircraft I've ever seen, a yellow amber color, surrounding the object.  After a couple minutes it veered north, the direction I was facing and continued onward.  At this time I noticed a second light, just like the one before, in the same place I noticed the first one taking the exact same course as the first.  I watched the first until it flickered out.  And watched the second till it flickered out.  I don't think they went out because they got to far away.  They weren't moving fast enough to get that far off. They just got fainter and fainter and then were gone.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Odd.;2016-07-04 22:00:00;10 minutes;The fireworks just got done and then we saw about 5 things flying in the air we thought it was just fireworks but they didn't die down until about 10 minutes and it was just really odd.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Addendum to previous report:  These lights were first observed at a point nearly due S of my observation point in the backyard.;2016-07-15 21:05:00;15-20 minutes;Addendum to previous report:  These lights were first observed at a point nearly due South of my observation point in the back yard.  They were very near the Moon, which was at an angle of about 30 degrees in the Southern Sky.  These lights moved very slowly East to West, and maintained position in relation to one another while moving.   I believe that, while the brightest lights were what first caught my eye, there were other smaller lights that seemed to move with them.   At this angle, and with trees surrounding and shrouding our view, I would estimate as many as 30 lights. When we went out to the front yard was when we saw the scope of the lights.  What we had observed previously was just a small section of the sky.  Now we saw a band of these lights stretching from the Southern horizon to nearly the Northern one, almost 180 degrees, covering a fairly narrow band that bisected the night sky.  This immense band of lights moved in a Westerly direction until hazy clouds obscured it.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Formation of moving lights moving East to West across nearly the entire night sky.;2016-07-15 21:05:00;15-20 minutes;Formation of moving lights moving East to West across nearly the entire night sky At approximately 9:05 PM, I was sitting in my backyard with my girl friend, relaxing after dinner.  The 3/4 moon was shining in the Southern sky, observable through the willow tree branches in the yard.  I looked up at the moon and was surprised to see what appeared to be the Big Dipper at first, just to the East of the moon.  I was surprised to see a constellation that close to the moon, because the brightness usually obscures stars.   As I watched, I could see that there were not just 4-6 lights, but many more, and then I noticed the entire array moving from East to West.  We moved to a position where we could see more of the sky, and these lights were in a V formation, with the point of the v heading West in the direction of travel.   After about 7-8 minutes, they moved out of the line of sight, and we went to the front yard where there are no trees to obstruct the sky, and saw an array of moving lights from the Southern horizon almost to the Northern horizon.  I would describe the formation as a series of those V's I described, in linear format running North to South almost like the serrated edge of a saw blade.  The sky became misty with clouds and after a total viewing time of about 20 minutes, we could no longer see these lights. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and found him to be both eloquent, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.
