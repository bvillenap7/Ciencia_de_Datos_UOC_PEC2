Small, bright orb in Broomfield.;2011-07-25 22:15:00;seconds;Small, bright orb in Broomfield. I was stargazing with my telescope (Broomfield, CO), looking about 336 NW (I know that doesn't help with sky measurements- sorry), when a single white orb moved in a perfectly straight line across my view.  It was not blurry at all- just incredibly crisp and small.  There were no other objects with it, and it had no tail, so I am pretty sure it wasn't a shooting star.  I am not sure if it actually WAS spherical (since it was so small), but the telescope was in focus and it didn't seem distorted. I am a university student in Boulder.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
