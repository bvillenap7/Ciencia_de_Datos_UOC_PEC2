Large, rectangular object seen flying in broad daylight;2009-09-09 14:15:00;2 min;Large, rectangular object seen flying in broad daylight I was driving Northbound on Hwy. 287.  What appeared to be just North of Dillon Rd., was a flying object going Westward.  Although I was not close enough to see great detail (I was about 3/4 of a mile away), it did not look like anything I have seen before it was flying slowly at a constant altitude (approximately 100-150 ft. off of the ground).  It was going slower than an airplane and appeared far too big and rectangular to be a helicopter.  Because of its rectangular shape, I first thought it was a banner trailing behind an airplane (like the type you see at sporting events).  There was definitely no plane ahead of it though.  It was broad daylight and many cars were on the road...surely someone else saw this today?  Also, perhaps coincidentally, my car's engine timing seemed off for a minute...the engine reved up and down while at a stop light. NOTE:  there was a reported UFO sighting in the area (on Dillon Rd.) about two weeks ago it was reported in The Broomfield Enterprise.  I dismissed the article at the time, but what i saw today makes me wonderâ€¦;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
