There were 3 adults there and we looked over toward Northglenn from Broomfield and then we noticed these 3 weird lights first.   Thought they were just lanterns then the shapes got clearer.  They were triangle and went to four and then the mother ship appeared below it.  It was more cone shaped.   There is a great video on YOU TUBE that was posted right after.  She got a upfront from her balcony the show.  They went in and out of the main ship and then disappeared in an instant both a plane and a helicopter flew by them so we could tell not those for sure.   Definitely a UFO and they are making them self visible more and more.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Iridescent dots meandering through the sky in various formations.;2015-07-25 22:00:00;5 minutes;Iridescent dots meandering through the sky in various formations I looked up at the sky and saw a shape that looked like a very bright constellation in the sky, low on the horizon.  As I stared at the constellation to figure out which one it was, the dots started to drift into a different pattern.  They looked almost like multi-colored, iridescent lanterns taking a slow journey across the sky.  They went from South West to North East.   They drifted into a loose triangle formation, then slowly went into a meandering line, until they disappeared.  Instead of continuing traveling from point A to point B, they hovered over a certain point and slowly winked out.   There were lots of little dots, and some very hard to see (small) rectangular shapes that you could only see when they flashed a very low level, dark blue.  There was no sound at all.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
