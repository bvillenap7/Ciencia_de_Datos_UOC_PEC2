My friend was in the back seat looking out the back window and she shouted to us to look.  There were 3 tear dropped shaped objects in a triangle formation, the radio station went out and we just heard static for 2 minutes.  Then the objects just dissapeared. The radio came back on. there were 3 tear dropped shaped objects, they were silver but not glowing, they were metallic and shinning.  Hoovered and then dissappeared after a few minutes.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
Horizontal gray teardrop shaped craft arced across neighborhood  just above houses;2017-02-25 13:15:00;2 minutes;horizontal gray teardrop shaped craft arced across neighborhood just above houses. I was on my way home from the grocery store at about 1:15pm on 25 February, 2017, heading south on Kohl St. in Broomfield, CO.  As I stopped at the intersection of W. 11th, looking southward, I saw a strange object moving above the roof tops near the intersection of Kohl St. and W. 10th Avenue, a block away. The object was a solid and somewhat irregularly shaped teardrop that was horizontal and heading at an even level and speed towards the east.  It was a gunmetal gray color.  The plumper part of the object was to the east and the sharper point to the west.  It was smooth, but on the east end, the shape had a slightly squared edge on the top rim.  The bottom of it seemed flat.  I wondered if it were a drone, but it had no protruding parts, such as propellers or wings.  I am estimating that this object was about two feet long and two and a half feet at the widest point. There was no traffic, so I turned east on W. 11th and kept looking at it as it arced northeast above the houses on the next street.  I turned down that street, but it flew beyond the street and disappeared from view. The wind was pretty strong from the northwest at that time.  If it had been debris, I believe it would have tumbled and pirouetted in the sky, taking on irregular shapes.  Instead, it remained in the same shape, and it moved in a completely even trajectory, at a steady altitude, and at a steady pace.  I do not believe this was debris caught in the wind.  I believe it was a craft moving at a steady velocity, with purpose, towards the east/northeast. If it made any sound, I did not hear it because I was in the car and the windows were rolled up completely.;39.9141244186047;-105.074105813953
