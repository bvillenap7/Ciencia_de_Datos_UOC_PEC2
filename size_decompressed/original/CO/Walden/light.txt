Then it started to flash colors, red, green, blue, yellow.  And it was just hovering.   I turned down my driveway and itâ€™s about a mile long, this thing was so close I called my dad to come outside because I was frantic.  My dad saw it, and it almost landed in our back field.  Then we ran inside and locked the door and watched it for about an hour or so from our kitchen window.   But also less than a week ago my friends and I saw a green object in sky moving oddly and fast.  There was four of us in the car when we all saw it.;40.7103;-106.2763
