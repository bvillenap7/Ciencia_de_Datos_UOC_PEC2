Bright oval objects hovering over Walden, CO 08/02/20;2020-08-02 07:30:00;2 hours;Bright oval objects hovering over Walden, CO 08/02/20 The objects were large.  They were well above 60,000 feet of altitude, well above the few cirrus clouds.  At first we thought it was the morning star, but seemed too large and in the wrong place. It did not move in the sky for over an hour.  We noticed another. It was smaller, but it also was further away.  This one was also stationary for most of an hour.  With 2 pair of binoculars and a monocular we agreed they were oval.  The center of the oval was dark.  They seemed to have an aura, like a bright light field around them.  There is some difference of opinion, but the aura may have been brighter and wider on the short ends.  Though the entirity of the objects was quite bright, easily seen in the blue sky with the sun fully risen, there was a VERY bright spot which seemed to be a reflection of the sun.  One of us saw that there seemed to be a gray line along the center of the long access.  At some point the lower object seemed to change from oval to circular.  Perhaps a position shift of a capsule shaped object?  When they moved It was NE to SW. The higher one moved rather quickly out of sight crossing from the center of my visual field to 2/3rds toward the edge of my  peripheral field in about 20 minutes.  The larger, lower one stayed stationary longer then followed the other at a slower pace.;40.7103;-106.2763
