White dot/sphere seen by four campers mid-day.;2016-06-11 11:00:00;10 minutes;White dot/sphere seen by four campers mid-day. So I was up in the Colorado Mountains this weekend, Thursday through Sunday approximately 25 miles southeast of Walden.   Saturday, I was in the camper preparing lunch.  It was about 11:00AM.  My son, a friend of mine, and his son were sitting outside chilling when someone noticed an object way up in the sky behaving oddly.  They were talking about it for a bit when I finally couldn't ignore the conversation anymore.   When I went to check it out, it took me a bit to find but there was a clear object way up. About airplane altitude.  Or at least that is how it appeared.  It was a white dot or ball.  No wings or any other shape was discernible.  It moved across the sky with about the speed of a high altitude airplane or maybe a little faster but made no sound and its movements were definitely not an airplane.  While watching, it did a couple of 360 degree turns and a hair-pin 180 degree turn.  We had no cell reception, so I didn't have my phone handy or I would have filmed it.  I was really wishing I had my binoculars but I didn't pack them. We watched about 10 minutes before we lost sight of it and we never did come up with a good explanation.  A bird could possibly explain the behavior but it was WAY up there and again we couldn't see anything that resembled wings.  We were already at 9500 feet of elevation.  I just don't know if a bird would be that high.  It could have been a weather balloon I suppose.  It looked like that but I'm not so sure about the behavior.  How would a balloon move like that?  The other option could be some military aircraft I suppose.  Or a drone but it seemed too high for that.;40.7103;-106.2763
