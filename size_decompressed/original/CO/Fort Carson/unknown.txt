red and green unidentified lights near an army ammo point;1992-07-20 02:30:00;15min;Red and green unidentified lights near an army ammo point. I was in the army and I was in charge of  a guard force of  5 men.  I was the sergeant in charge, we were on guard duty guarding an ammo point(Bunkers).I was sitting in the hummer with my driver parked at the entrance of the ammo point facing towards the main road that lead to the ammo point entrance. As we were sitting there we both saw green and red lights ,that looking  back it now it was like there were spinning. At first my driver thought that it was some kind of firing range and we were seeing tracer rounds, the army uses red tracers when they are conducting night fire exercises, but the only problem was the spot we saw the lights was a camping area for the non-commissioned officer school, I knew this because that was the area I went to school before I became a sergeant, and another thing is that why would someone be firing live rounds near an ammo point. So, I radioed in to the command center and notified the officer of the guard and advised them I was going to go investigate the lights. So I had my soldiers load there weapons and be on high alert and my driver and myself started up the hummer and rolled to the area we saw the lights, we used a spot light and we could not see anything and we identified ourselves and no one replied to or calls. There was a quit eerie feeling so after a few minutes we returned back to the entrance to the ammo point and it was not long before the officer of the guard showed up and we told him what we saw and he told us to make a report and that was the last thing I remember about that incident.
