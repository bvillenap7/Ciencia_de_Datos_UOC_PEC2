circular craft that strobed different collors;2010-10-04 04:30:00;over 20 min;circular craft that strobed different collors Around 4:30 am I went on my balcony to have a cigarette and looked up in the sky at the stars.  I saw what I thought to be a star at first but it was very bright and flashing different colors very quickly.  Then I thought it might be a plane, but it stayed in one spot.  As I kept watching it moved from side to side and then stayed still a while. It continued this for the duration of its time in the sky.  Then it seemed to get smaller until it was gone. I do not have a video camara.;39.8855;-104.9872
