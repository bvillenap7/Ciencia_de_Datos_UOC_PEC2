V-formation of 8-9 crafts, flying north to south, in Northglenn, CO.;2016-08-15 23:00:00;10 seconds;V-formation of 8-9 crafts, flying north to south, in Northglenn, CO. August 15th, 2016, I was outside on the balcony of my apartment in Northglenn, CO between the hours of 10:00 pm and midnight.  I looked up and saw about 8 or 9 relatively small crafts arranged in a V formation fly just overhead moving from north to south.  At first glance, I thought it was a flock of geese, but these definitely weren’t birds.  Only about 10 seconds had passed between the time they appeared and the time they were out of sight, so I didn’t get a long enough look to be able to specifically identify the crafts’ shape.  They were something between spherical and cubic, but what caught my attention and ultimately disqualified my first interpretation of it being a flock of geese was the lack of wings.  There were definitely no wings on any of the crafts, nor did I notice any “flapping” movements. They flew together in perfect unison while maintaining the V formation, almost as if they were connected in the air.  Their movements were swift and completely silent.  Geese make enough noise when they fly that most people can tell when their approaching even before they’re in sight. These crafts flew by without even slightly disrupting the air.;39.8855;-104.9872
