3 FIREBALL/ORBS FLYING TOGETHER ON NEW YEARS.;2016-12-31 23:00:00;10 seconds;3 FIREBALL/ORBS FLYING TOGETHER ON NEW YEARS. AT ABOUT 11:00 PM, I HEARD A SCREAM EMINATE FROM OUTSIDE OF MY WINDOW.  IT WAS NEW YEARS SO I COULD HEAR FIREWORKS OUTSIDE AND THOUGHT I'D JUST TAKE A LOOK.   WHEN I LOOKED OUT, I NOTICED THREE FIREBALL/ORBS FLYING TOGETHER IN A TRIANGLE SHAPE.  THEY WERE MOVING PRETTY QUICKLY, QUICKER THAN AN AIRPLANE DOES.  THEY WERE MOVING NORTHWEST IN THE SKY AND THEN ONE DISAPPEARED, LEAVING 2.  THE 2 THEN SHORTLY THEREAFTER TURNED BLACK AND DISAPPEARED.;39.8855;-104.9872
