Hovering triangular shape seen with flashing lights seen in Colorado;2007-10-10 23:05:00;15 seconds;Hovering triangular shape seen with flashing lights seen in Colorado   Driving home from work when I saw a flashing light as well as a couple of bright lights all on same object. Originally thought it was a plane, but when I got closer realized it was hovering in one spot and I slowed down and noticed the triangular shape it had to it.  I was going to pull over, but decided against it and kept driving. When I looked in my rear view mirror a few seconds later I couldn't see it anymore.;39.8855;-104.9872

Moving from SO to NO.  Absolutely noiseless.  No good reference for size or distance from where it was viewed.;39.8855;-104.9872
Triangle shaped object with white lights on the three tips seen moving south to north;2016-09-25 20:19:00;7-8 seconds;Triangle shaped object with white lights on the three tips seen moving south to north We saw an equilateral triangular shaped object move across the sky in a basically south to north trajectory.  We were basically facing due west and it moved from our left to right almost as if it were following I-25.  The trajectory did not change. There was no sound but given the height that was expected as commercial jets fly overhead all the time and can be heard, this was much lower. There were white lights on all of the tips of the triangle.  I saw the tips having three smaller lights equidistant from each other on each tip but my wife did not see this detail.  There were no green or red lights and the lights were not blinking.  The lights were rather dim as well having shown up basically overhead when first noticed which was 1/2 way across the night sky then after the 7-8 seconds they dimmed away before reaching the horizon. If the object had passed a full moon the tips would almost touch the edges.  It was more than twice the size of the commercial jets which leave Denver Int'l airport.;39.8855;-104.9872
