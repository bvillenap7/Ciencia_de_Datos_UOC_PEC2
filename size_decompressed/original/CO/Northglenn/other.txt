Crafts Watching Fireworks with enormous crowd below;2011-07-04 21:35:00;2 minutes;Crafts Watching Fireworks with enormous crowd below This happened on July 4th at Webster Lake in Northglenn, CO.  The time was approximately 9:35pm MST.   Family were at the lake with family watching the fireworks, and took a picture.  The picture clearly shows fireworks and that chaos in the air, and then to the right, I would say about an inch on the cell phone picture itself is a very not normal looking thing, very bright with self-illuminating lights.   I would like to show the picture and get some feedback on it, maybe someone else from the lake saw it too.  Mother-in-law says the craft hoovering was accompanied by 2-3 more crafts like it.  Hope this sparks some interest, especially with the crafts seen in Lafayette, CO, recently.;39.8855;-104.9872
