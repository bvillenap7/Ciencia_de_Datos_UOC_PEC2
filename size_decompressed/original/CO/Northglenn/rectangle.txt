I kept walking, but the whole time I was staring at this thing.  It didn't move like an airplane.  I was way too slow.  It moved in an almost perfect line, and about as quick as a snail crawls.   I originally thought it was a P-shape or something because it looked like it has a small bulge at the top, but I now think it was a smooth rectangle shape, but I am not totally sure because it was so far away.;39.8855;-104.9872
