This is the third time this week I've seen a lighted object (maybe lit by the sun?) hovering and moving slowly west of Evergreen. This;2006-02-13 17:30:00;45 minutes;This is the third time this week I've seen a lighted object (maybe lit by the sun?) hovering and moving slowly west of Evergreen. This evening I saw it four times in 45 minutes, it either moved away from me and disappeared to the west or moved down behind a mountain (Floyd Hill). At dusk I saw it again but it was dark and still hovering and moving slowly.;39.6347214285714;-105.337352380952
2 vertical lights changing color and moving erratically in the night sky;2010-04-08 22:00:00;20 minutes;2 vertical lights changing color and moving erratically in the night sky I am an environmental toxicologist and former college professor.  I usually don't belive this kind of stuff but this is something I definately have never seen before. My dog was barking uncontrollably so I went out on my deck to see if a bear or coyotes were in my yard.  While out on my deck I saw 2 lights directly on top of each other hovering in the western sky.  The two lights moved simultaneously so I'm assuming they were on 1 object.  The lights were white then subtly changed to a blue hue and back to white.  The lights hovered, then moved right very fast and stopped then moved left and up very fast and stopped.  Each time the object stopped it hovered for a few minutes before moving again. At that point, I saw a red light flying very fast toward the object.  I thought the red light was an airplane but it moved significantly faster than your average passenger jet in the sky.  The red light flew directly at the object until the red light was hidden behind the object and I never saw it again. The object kept moving fast and hovering and then in an instant it flew directly downward below the tree line and I couldn't see it.  My husband, who is a die hard skeptic of all things supernatural, saw it and admitted that it was unlike anything he had ever seen.  He couldn't believe what he was seeing so he finally said. It must be the space shuttle.;39.6347214285714;-105.337352380952
Two bright lights that changed formation in NNE sky.;2011-09-28 21:18:00;1 minute;Two bright lights that changed formation in NNE sky. I was working on my book on the computer and our Dachshund  Gracie was Grrr-ing at me like Come On Dad, I really need to go outside right now. Dad was working on edits, but she persisted, so I put on my sandals and headed out the front door with her. There was an airplane flying over in the Northeast, so I looked up. There, at about 70 degrees up in the north north east what caught my eye were two very bright objects, brighter than Venus and larger in apparent diameter, and with a bit more of a yellow white color to them, similar in color to incandescent car headlights or aircraft landing lights. They were moving slowly, significantly more slowly than an average satellite, and flying due north about the width of my thumbnail (at arms length) apart in direct line with each other, both equal brightness and one directly behind the other following the exact same course. My first thought was that it was as bright as an Iridium Flare, but the Iridium satellites do not fly in clo! se formation, they are distributed around the planet for good satellite phone reception.  Well, what happened next pretty well cinched it.  They both dimmed down together, not at the same spot but at the same time, and then the dimmer satellites changed formation, with one moving off to the side and catching up with the other while moving from it's 6 o:clock position to it's 4 o:clock but keeping about the same relative distance.  So, obviously at least one of the two objects changed speed and direction, unless it was actually one LARGE object that changed orientation.  Either way, it wasn't normal!  I checked the time when I got back on the front porch and got some light on my watch and it was 9:20 PM MT Thursday, Sept. 28th, so it happened between 9:18 and 9:19 PM, observed from my front yard in Evergreen, CO. I came in and checked Heaven's Above, and there were NO Iridium satellites visible at all from this location this evening.  It is pretty early in the evening for a Satellite to go dark that high in the sky, the terminator (Earth's shadow) should still be farther east, (unless they were much lower and in the atmosphere) and they were still visible though much dimmer for another 30 seconds or so.  The only published satellites anywhere close to this time are these, and neither was in the proper direction, anywhere near high enough or bright enough.

Tis a mystery,;39.6347214285714;-105.337352380952
25+ satellite-looking objects flying across the Ursa Major constellation.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-29 20:35:00;20 minutes;25+ satellite-looking objects flying across the Ursa Major constellation Over the course of at least 20 minutes my family and I saw at least 25 satellite-looking objects fly across the Ursa Major constellation.  Initially we presumed they were typical satellites given their speed and size though considering the number of them as well as their linear path and equidistant spacing we believe they couldn’t have been average satellites.  We stood outside of our home with all indoor and outdoor lights turned off for the duration of the sighting, counting a minimum of 25 of them.  We also saw multiple planes flying and in comparison we determined there was no possible way they were planes of any kind.;39.6347214285714;-105.337352380952
Massive string of slow/standard-moving lights in single-file line consumes entire sky ((Starlink satellites??));2021-02-11 05:55:00;10 minutes;Massive string of slow/standard-moving lights in single-file line consumes entire sky from the lead light to final light in string UFO Sighting in Evergreen, CO – west of Denver – on Feb 11, 2021 5:55am In the dark early morning sky, a slow moving series of white lights all traveling in one line across the entire sky.  The spacing was not exact, but the trajectory appeared to be exact, in order to create the vast single-file line. The movement was roughly North-South or NW-SE and the front leading light of the impossibly long line was about 5:55 and lasted for nearly 10 minutes until tail end of the line crossed over my home on Stanley Mountain.  Military aircraft has formerly been sighted many times since living here adjacent to a canyon between Bear Mountain and Stanley Mountain.  It is a joy when the fighter jets screech through the canyon at about eye level for me (8k feet).  Whenever they are sighted the trajectory is similar NW-SE (N-S) but tremendously different height.  Whether military or not, the path is similar – coming from the mountains (NW) heading out of the deep mountains, as I live on edge of the front range, and the line moved toward the edge of the flat land and Colorado Springs (South).   Air Force activity ?  Photo image and video attempts did not capture/show any stars, or the vast moving string of lights.;39.6347214285714;-105.337352380952
