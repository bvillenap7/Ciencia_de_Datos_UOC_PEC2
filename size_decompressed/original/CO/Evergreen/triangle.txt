Triangle shape of lights, traveling at a fast speed toward lighting storm.;2013-06-27 22:30:00;3-5 minutes;Triangle shape of lights, traveling at a fast speed toward lighting storm. We live at 8200 feet on top of a mountain and we can see for miles in several directions.   There was a huge electrical storm in the distance towards Littleton, Colorado. I went to close a window and noticed  three huge lights formed a triangle shape and this was hovering in the sky, it seemed just above the tree top.  These lights were unusually bright.  There was no sound.  For a few seconds, other lights blinked in between the triangle. I could see the lightning in the distance, but there was no thunder.  I stood there and watched it for a minute then woke up my husband and told him to look at the weird lights.   He ran upstairs to the top deck to get  a better view.  He saw the same thing. This triangle of lights took off towards the lighting storm at an unbelievable speed.  This was faster than any helicopter or plane could fly. My husband works for an airline company and I own several businesses.;39.6347214285714;-105.337352380952
