Small silver orb spotted above Denver CO mid-morning in fall of 2004;2004-09-01 10:00:00;10 minutes;Small silver orb spotted above Denver CO mid-morning in fall of 2004 I was working with three other people framing a house in the foothills above Denver Colorado.  I was on the roof and asked one of the guys on the ground to hand me a nail gun.  As he handed up the nail gun, he said, Hey, look at that.  What,  I said.  He said, I don't know, look. So I did.  I saw nothing and was busy so I blew it off for a few minutes.  Then he said check it out.  I turned and looked at the sky for several minutes and saw nothing.  It was 10:00 in the morning and the sky was almost clear.  Just then a small cloud was drifting across above us.  He said right there above that cloud.  Do you see it?  After a few more minutes, I did.  It looked like a little speck of cotton off of a cottonwood tree, way up in the air, only it wasn't moving.  I had to get back to work, so I did. The next chance I got, I started looking for the dot again.  Now all 4 of us were looking for it.  After a few minutes the person who originally spotted it, spotted it again.  An airplane was flying alomg now and we used it as a guage to let eveyone else know its locatuion.  Pretty soon, we all saw it It looked like a silverish metallic orb with the sun shining off of it.  It's altitude was way greater than the airplane or the cloud that went past earlier.  It was not moving.  I thought for sure it had to be a satelite.  Everyone else went back to work except for me and the person who spotted it first.  After about another four or five minutes the object moved in a direction that appeared to be down for about a half a second, then went to our right (west) very rapidly until it went out of sight.  When the object moved the speed appeared to be constant.  No starting slow and then going faster, and when it went out of sight, it was due to the fact that the sun reflecting off of it quit shining on it, so we couldn't see it anymore, not that it went behind the mountains or anything.  I would estimate the speed to be about five times as fast as the speed of the planes that were flying over at the time.   I looked at my friend and said did you see that?  Yes he said.  I said what did you see?  He said he saw the dot drop down and then take off that way, (indicating towards the mountains).  Me too, I said.  That was about all that was ever really said about the incident.  It was just forgotten and dismissed as one of those things that make you go hmmmm.  I will never forget what I saw though.  And I still remember it as if it were yesteday.   My opinion.  It wasn't an alien spacecraft.  It was something our government made.

All lights evenly spaced apart all moving synchronized.  Kept driving in unpopulated area, 30 seconds later saw 4 evenly spaced light in the sky horizontal, then they disappeared.  Myself (49 year old R.N.) and my 16 year old daughter observed this. Tried to videotape the sighting, however it was too dark to capture on an IPhone.;39.6347214285714;-105.337352380952
