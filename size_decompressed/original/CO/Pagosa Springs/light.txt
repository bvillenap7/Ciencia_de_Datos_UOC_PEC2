Bright light hovering over city.;2008-11-10 06:30:00;About 10 min.;Bright light hovering over city. It was on November 10, 2008 that Dad, my Grandpa, and me were going from Colorado Springs to Pagosa Springs for a hunting trip. It was about 6:30pm, we were near the end of the 5hr drive and were coming down from a mountain pass called, Wolf Creek Pass. Coming down the hill you can see the city below. It isn’t a big city so the lights didn’t really block out the stars at all. We were in a 3 seat truck with my grandpa driving, me in the middle and my dad next to me. I was chatting with my grandpa when my dad asked what planet he was looking at. I looked and saw a very bright light that was off in the distance. I said that I didn’t think it was a planet because it was so bright, I thought it was a helicopter. At that time the light seemed to collapse on itself and disappear. This really freaked me out because of how fast it was gone. About 10sec later it appeared again a little ways to the right. Now it seemed brighter and it started to fade in and out of sight. My grandpa said that he thought it was a plane, I told him I didn’t think so because it was just sitting there. It then stopped flashing and just stayed there. All three of us were so drawn by the object that my grandpa almost hit an Elk that was standing on the road. After that the object just stayed there and as we got closer to the city the object was even brighter and we could definitely tell that it was over the city. That’s when we saw airplanes flying around the light. That’s when the light started flashing again and started moving off into the distance every time it did it. The airplanes seemed to go with it. After that we saw it for a couple more minutes and then it was gone. I have really changed my belief about UFOs after this. I once did not believe in the possibility of them, now I do think something is out there.;37.2523;-107.0385
