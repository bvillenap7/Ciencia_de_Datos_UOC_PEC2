I could recognize the exact shape since it was all light. The color was a red with just a little orange. I was with my brother the moment I saw it and rapidly told him to look, but the craft had already dissapeared. It moved at a speed which was never as slow as a plane, it was also moving at a faster speed than a jet. I could say its speed was around half the speed of a shooting star. It moved in a straight line from left to right (from my point of view). It didn't make any sound.;39.64455;-106.36745
