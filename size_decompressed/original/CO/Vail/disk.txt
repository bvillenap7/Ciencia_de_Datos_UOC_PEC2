MUFON COLORADO REPORT:  Glowing disc seen below clouds.;2005-11-03 17:40:00;5-6 seconds;Glowing disc seen below clouds. I was walking my dog in East Vail looking to the northeast.  There was extensive cloud cover and a fairly brisk breeze blowing the clouds along. I looked up and saw a glowing elliptical object moving below the clouds. It was yellow/white in the center and reddish/orange around the edge. Their were no blinking lights and no sound. It appeared to be about three times the size of Mars right now which is on a close approach to Earth. I had the object in sight for about 5-6 seconds before it slipped into the clouds and was gone. A short time later the clouds blew out and I could see the stars of Cassiopeia in the area where the disc was. I was so sure of what I saw I called the local police to report it and leave my number in case anyone else saw it. I am a MUFON investigator and will be filing a report with MUFON.;39.64455;-106.36745
