Fire Ember in the Sky That Changes Form and Does Tricks Like a Bird;2012-07-22 08:50:00;10 seconds;Fire Ember in the Sky That Changes Form and Does Tricks Like a Bird During a lightening storm I was walking to my house and I saw what looked like  Yellow and Orange Embers, Fire with a tail, whisk through the sky like a dragon, or a bird playing in the wind, then disappeared only to reappear in a different looking form!   Two white lights side by side, with a dark shape behind them, disk shaped.  It rolls and flies at incredible speed in loops and barrels.  Like a bird!  There was an amber fire burning on one end of the disk. It didn't look like an orb, but actual fire, Yellow and Orange again.  On one turn it made, I saw green light flash.  Then it stopped on a dime, hovered in place with the first two white lights I saw facing me again before it rotates downwards and head dives to the ground, below the houses!   My little sister said she had seen a UFO earlier, her first one, shes 11,  She saw a similar shaped UFO making huge dips as it skipped across the sky!!!;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
