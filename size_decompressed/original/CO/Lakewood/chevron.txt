Lakewood, CO.;2014-12-31 17:34:00;30 seconds;Lakewood co I was driving home new years eve on Hwy 285 just after I passed the Sims St exit a large white v-shaped object appeared.  It was in was going straight down at incredible speed  then disappeared behind a small mountain.   There only a small valley behind that mountain before the terrain rises into the foothills.  There were no signs of a crash as I passed by the valley behind the mountain or anything on the news.  At first I told myself it must of been a meteor.   But then I watched videos of meteors and such and nothing looks anything like what I saw.  Not any kind of trail behind very clear crisp outline and in a perfect tight v shape.   What the heck was it!   There were plenty of other drivers on the road at the time but I haven't been able to find anyone else reporting this.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Boomerang stealth mode gliding object.;2015-11-08 21:00:00;2 minutes;Boomerang stealth mode gliding object Saw object gliding straight across the sky in front of us as we daced west. It was very far away, but it was a big object.  It looked like a giant boomerang that appeared to be in a stealth mode.  We never would have saw it unless we were so focused on the sky looking for meteors.  It was nearly the same color as the sky it was flying in front of.  Very hard to see, but two of us made the shape and size out clearly.  It had to be at least 5 times the size of a 747.  No lights on it whatsoever.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885

V-shaped craft with 5-6 dim lights cruising silently over Lakewood, CO, in a southwest direction. 8pm.;2017-10-10 20:05:00;10 seconds;V shaped craft with 5-6 dim lights cruising silently over Lakewood, CO in a southwest direction. 8pm. I was in my yard looking up while taking the dog out and quickly spotted a satellite, then a plane, then my eye caught the movement of a dark v shaped craft with 5-6 dim, barely visible lights outlining it, going southwest silently across the sky.  I would guess the craft was about as high as the helicopters that routinely cruise around the city, and within 5-10 seconds, it was past the treeline.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
