Light reversing directions silent - watched for ten minutes;1969-07-04 10:30:00;5 mins;light reversing directions silent - watched for ten minutes This has stayed with me my entire life, I'm fifty now, I was seven when it happened.  Up front, it was pretty anti climactic event, but it sticks because even at seven I knew what I was watching couldnt really be doing what it was doing.   My brother, myself, and a friend were sleeping out in the backyard as kids do, and spotted something very high moving in the night sky.  It was silent, and clearly reversed directions numerous times, we watched for about ten minutes. It was a steady light. Yes it was the 4th of July, no it wasnt fireworks   Ive followed the ufo noise over the years as a result, I think 98% is bull.   No idea what we were watching -planes dont reverse directions and it was too high and silent for a helicopter.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885

One of the lighted ovals disappeared and then came back.  Observer 1 then yelled for the others to come and see. It was about 2 miles away in the denver metro area and about 2 miles up in the sky.  Observer 2 saw three orange ovals.  They were going in a circle and then some disappeared and then came back.  After that they all disappeared and did not return.   Observer 3 went outside when observer 1 called and saw three comet like objects circling one another.  Objects were disappearing and coming back before finally vanishing all together.  The objects seen were a very large size.  If all observers could guess how large the objects seemed to be they would all say they objects were about each the size of half the moon.  We all observed this north east of where we were at.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Inverted W craft flying low from northwest to southeast, followed by 5 bright lights forming into a circle which dropped out of sight.;2015-11-01 18:15:00;5 minutes;Inverted W craft flying low from northwest to southeast, followed by 5 bright lights forming into a circle which dropped out of sight. When outside with my daughter to walk the dog at about 6:15, we happened to be looking up at the constellations when my daughter noticed a upside down W shaped object coming towards us.  This object was noticeable due to the rows of lights outlining the craft, forming an upside down W-shape. This object was about a football field across and 300 ft in the sky above flying from the northwest towards the southeast.  The craftâ€™s lights were slightly dimmer than the stars in the sky, yet still very noticeable.  The craft, though very low to the ground, was silent as it flew over our heads.  As it passed over our heads, the left side of the object moved in towards itself, making the upside-down W shape fold in on itself, allowing it to turn more towards the southeast.  After this it disappeared out of sight. We believed this to be the last of the sighting and turned to go inside to draw a picture of the craft at about 6:17 when we noticed more activity towards the northeast.  This time the objects were on the horizon and they looked entirely different.  At first I thought they were 5 intensely bright meteorites due to the burning tales which they emitted.  But we noticed they were lined in a vertically slanted row and not moving, so they were definitely not meteorites.  After about 5 seconds, the fireball-like objects suddenly moved into a circle.   One of the lights on the left moved more towards the west, while the other lights began to come together at the center of the circle, lowered beyond sight due to the trees and homes blocking the view, falling out of our sight.  Finally, the one light remaining towards the west followed the others beyond sight as well.  The entire event lasted from about 6:15 pm at the first sighting to 6:20 pm Mountain Standard Time in the area around Bear Creek Lake Park near the intersection of Morrison Road and South Kipling Parkway in Lakewood, Colorado.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Black object heading east to west, very high, and looked like two merkabas next to each other;2016-06-16 20:45:00;<10 minutes;Black object heading east to west, very high, and looked like two merkabas next to each other The object was black and looked like two spherical objects, side by side, from a distance.  When I got my binoculars out, it was clearly two black objects side by side.  However, they were not round as they appeared to the naked eye, they were shaped like a merkaba but not precisely(that's the closest thing I can think of).  They flew or drifted west and seemed to go higher and higher.  My kids and some kids in the neighborhood saw it.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
These 3 bright objects appeared and started moving higher up in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly twinkling stars?  PD));2016-08-12 03:00:00;North;I'm sitting on my porch and these 3 bright objects appeared and started moving higher up in the sky,  it seemed like they flew about a couple hundred feet and then orbit in a triangalur motion and then do the same process again, and again.   The objects were really bright, the colors were pink, green, yellow, blue,  and white.  We could easily  tell they were not stars, a plane, or a satelight, or shooting star.   The object stayed in or sight for a good couple hours and then shot up into the sky and disappeared and left a light beam streaming up into the sky.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Huge object with many small lights moving below the clouds in Lakewood towards Denver;2020-02-07 22:10:00;10 seconds;Huge object with many small lights moving below the clouds in Lakewood towards Denver I was standing outside of my 2nd floor apartment, in north Lakewood close to wheatridge, staring at the sky when I saw a small light dart downwards across the sky as I was looking straight out.  About 5 minutes later about 45 degrees to the left which would be going from southeast to south I saw far away in the sky what must have been a moving object not sure if it was cylinder or rectangular huge like a mile wide moving about at 20 miles per hour with many little lights like windows on the object.  At first I thought it was a banner someone was flying and then I thought why so many lights.  I tried to follow it and then I could not see it.  It lasted about 10 seconds and then it either disappeared or was beyond the houses or trees.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
