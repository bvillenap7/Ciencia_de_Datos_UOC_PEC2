Looked at it with a ITT generation 2 night scope,There was a second light. It was very near the first brighter light traveling south west. I let my daughter look at them for abought 30 seconds or so. Then I looked at them again, to my amazement there was a third light converging close to the first two lights. They came together to form a square formation trveling south at about 180 degrees. They stayed in formation untill they finally faded at about 215 degrees.When they did come into the formation all three lights were the same brighness. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness.  It is our impression that what he describes is indistinguishable from satellites.  It is not unusual to have more than one satellite in the field of view of an optical device.

Saw two star-like objects traveling southeast;2002-04-17 20:20:00;5 minutes;Saw two star-like objects traveling southeast To Whom It May Concern: I have never reported anything like this before. I would like to report a sighting of two star-like objects heading southeast this evening at 20:20 over Lakewood, CO. My wife confirmed this sighting by cell phone from a separate location and I spoke to a man at a convenience store who also witnessed it as it happened. Would Peterson AFB or Norad be able to confirm this sighting on radar? Here is a complete description of the sighting. As I drove west of Denver on Hwy 6 at about 20:20 Mountain time on 4/17/02, I was looking at the western sky at dusk to see if I could observe an astronomical event of planets aligning (see astronomical bulletins).  As I looked up again I noticed two star-like lights traveling at what appeared to be a very high altitude and very high rate of speed (above 200 mph at least).  They had no blinking lights but were apparently luminescent.  They remained equidistant apart and were traveling in a southeast direction.  I happened to be on my phone with my wife, who was traveling on I-25 North (about 10 minutes from where I was)at the time of my sighting.  I told her about it and then pulled over to get gas and get out of my car to look at it.  I saw the lights continue Southeast so I yelled over to a man getting out of his truck and asked if he could see these objects.  He stated he could.  I asked him if he knew what they were and he stated that he did not know.  He appeared interested and then went into the convenience store.  I started pumping gas and called my wife again and asked if she could see the lights.  She responded that she could and she pulled off the highway to get a better look.  She stated that they continued on their way in a southeastern direction at a constant rate of speed and distance apart until out of sight.  My reaction during the sighting was one of calm surprise and excitement to confirm it's existence with my wife.  I was also excited that my wife would take notice of something like this at the end of the day going home from work.

Blue light sighted low on Southern horizon moving in very strange and erratic patterns.;2006-11-21 23:10:00;2-3 minutes;Blue light sighted low on Southern horizon moving in very strange and erratic patterns. On 11-21-07 at approximately 11:10 pm I was in the backyard of my home walking back to go inside after emptying my trashâ€¦ I was looking towards the south and noticed a bright blue light low on the southern horizon at about 30 degrees or so...I first thought it was an air craft as there are many air craft that fly in from south to north because of the airport's landing patterns.  As I watched , it became apparent that this was not an aircraft or helicopter because of it's very erratic movements-first it appeared to be moving north toward me than suddenly stopped and rapidly turned west and went what appeared to be only a few hundred yards, then stopped again and shot straight up returning to the first position I saw it in.  Then it dropped very low from that position and disappeared from the southern horizon for only a few seconds, then reappeared and went straight up and shot towards the east, then stopped again and got much brighter in color-(blue) and dropped down and moved rapidly to the west again, dropped down to the low southern horizon made several circular patterns, and then went out and vanished.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Unusually bright light seen next to very bright full moon;2007-12-24 18:50:00;15 minutes;Unusually bright light seen next to very bright full moon I was out with family, going for a holiday lights viewing ride in a car. We decided to drive around the ritzy neighborhood on the north side of Green Mountain. I noticed earlier that there was a full moon and it was very bright, in the ENE sky. I like looking at the moon, so occasionally I would look at it again. One time I looked at it there was a bright light just to the right of the moon. I assumed it was Venus or a bright star, although I've never seen one so close to such a bright full moon. I looked again about 10 minutes later, and now the same light was to the LEFT of the moon. That didn't seem right to me. Someone told me they thought it was probably Mars. Two problems with that: it didn't have the usual reddish tint and was brighter than it would be EVEN IF it was AWAY FROM a full moon--it should have appeared even dimmer to me because of the brightness of the full moon so close to it and how did it move over to the other side of the moon? I decided at the time to doubt my observations, but now I am more curious, as there have been other reports of this object, one with photos, on this site. I didn't mention it at the time to anyone they were only looking at the holiday lights in that neighborhood. I am a member of MUFON and Colorado MUFON.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
bright starlike lights in midday in colorado;2009-07-23 11:00:00;45 minutes;bright starlike lights in midday in colorado at approximately 11:00 mountain time my wife and i went outside to smoke a cigarette and we heard a whine like a jet, i looked up seeing no jet and walked around the yard still looking upward.  i noticed what looked like two stars in broad daylight, and their aura exceeded midday light around them seeming to make a rippled outward moving ring in the area they were at what looked like less than an inch in my eye saying they were quite high one light was white the other a bright blue both with that ominous lighting, they moved very steadily but not in a constant line the white one more like a fast altered wave as planes do and the blue in a more wide and floaty motion in the same direction. my best guess of the range was at 85 degrees up from my location and at least outer stratosphere in distance, beyond what should be seen of planes and man made orbital objects especially for the hour in which it occurred there was a bit of anxiety in our pets as well but for most part the object didn't seem to be dropping or elevating from its location and after a bit it went out of line of sight from my wife and i and we went about our business.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Helicopter chasing ball of light, disappears.;2012-04-21 21:00:00;6 seconds;Helicopter chasing ball of light, disappears My friend and I were on the back porch smoking a cigarette when a whi8te ball of light with a helicopter 50 yards behind it flew over the house heading south.  They seemed to fly completely in tandem, or like they were connected, but I'm sure the distance between them was at least 40 yards.  They continued south and then suddenly the ball of light slowly faded out and the helicopter flew right through where it had been.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Orb of light slowly drifting across the sky, then it speeds away.;2013-07-24 23:00:00;~1 hour;Orb of light slowly drifting across the sky, then it speeds away. Last July we had our biggest group see the light we had all seen it a few times to that point and had gotten made fun of for it.  My friends house is a few blocks from Kipling and Colfax, and this night they had a few other friends come over to celebrate the night. We went out for a smoke at around 11 pm, then one of my friends noticed the light was back. It is very very bright, brighter than a star probably on the same scale of takeoff lights from planes which we see coming from Denver International Airport all the time.  But there was no blinking lights to designate which side of the plane or helicopter was facing us.   It started at a 30 degree angle with the horizon and very slowly moved south, there is a utility pole out back so we used it for a point of reference if we stood still.  It got past the pole in about 40 minutes, then it sped up to a planes speed, then shot off to the distance.  We see these lights every few days, usually just one slow mover then reaches a point and takes off like a fighter jet.  I used to work near Buckley AFB outside everyday so I'm very used to seeing jets do maneuvers overhead and the sound they produce.  This orb of light hasn't made a sound ever.  But we have seen it make dips, loops, and sharp full speed turns.  We have watched it take 3 hours on the path down the horizon to the north judging location on tall trees then just gain speed and disappear on the horizon.  And one time it even got close enough you could feel warmth on a freezing night on a 2012 December night, it also appeared like there was something pulsing down an aura on it.  There were times when it would glow slightly red on the top of the bright white, then little red balls would move downward around the ball of light then combine at the bottom and disappear.  It still looked small but I had the feeling if I threw a rock 40-50 feet up I would of hit it.  We have no idea what it is and our phones and cameras won't register it.  Altoget! her 20-30 people and a dog have seen these lights and didn't believe us until they got to see it for themselves.

4 lights spotted in Lakewood Colorado on Kipling.;2013-12-13 18:30:00;10 minutes;4 lights spotted in Lakewood Colorado on Kipling We were driving north bound on Kipling Blvd.  Around Kipling and Bowles me and my mother noticed four very bright lights that were stationary and seemed to be in formation. These lights were well above the street and ahead of us about 8-10 miles away.  The lights began to break formation and proceeded  on their own path. Two of the lights started to intersect each others path, but they did not colide.  We watched the lights for about 3 miles while driving.  Three of the lights that were closest to the east, started to fade away and or fly away, while the one remaining light intensified and slightly flashed a few times. Once we traveled another 2 miles or so the remaining light faded away.  I have traveled on this road for more than 20+ years, and I or my mother have never seen lights like that before  there.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Light seen in sky over Lakewood area.;2014-09-18 02:00:00;:45;Light seen in sky over Lakewood area. I woke up at around 2 am and focused on my east facing window for some reason. We have an annoying dog as our backyard neighbors and I thought maybe the dog had barked, so I was laying in bed looking out the window waiting for a bark, when I saw a small white light in the sky zoom in from the left (north) at a great deal of speed. The light stopped within the view of my window and stopped moving. I would estimate the light to be over the Colfax/Wadsworth area, but it was hard to tell as the I had a very limited frame of reference. In my sleep addled state I thought at first that it was a plane, but then I realIzed how fast it moved into my field of view and that it had stopped.  I surmised that if it was a plane, it's reference within the window would change against the tree tops I can also see In the window. I watched the light for a full 20 minutes and it never moved.  I then began to think it was a star, but again no other stars were visible due to the light pollution of Denver and it had literally flown into my field of view earlier. I drifted off to sleep at this time for about 10 minutes by my brdside clock and when I looked again the object was still in its same place and not moving. The light looked white and flickery like a star looks but it's position never moved against any reference points in my window. It never grew larger or smaller either, so I surmise it was hovering. It also had no noise I could discern, nor did it project any light (like a searchlight) it just looked like a star.  I fell asleep again at 2:35 and woke back up at 2:45 and the object was gone from view completely.  I even got out of bed to see if it was now behind a tree, but it was completely gone from view.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Orange-Red lights over the Rocky Mountains-Senn in Lakewood, Colorado.;2014-12-19 22:30:00;1 minutes;Orange-Red lights over the Rocky Mountains-Senn in Lakewood Colorado On Friday December 19, 2014, at approximately 10:30pm, I was on my back porch, looking in a southwest direction, when I noticed 2 orange-red lights coming over the Rocky Mountains.  As they were making no sound I was kind of puzzled, and I asked my granddaughter to come check it out, when several more came over the mountains.  (8 total) I then asked my granddaughter to get her aunt, her aunts boyfriend and my husband.  We all watched these lights for about 1 minute as they traveled north.  They all faded out one by one. Has anyone else reported these strange lights over Lakewood Colorado?;39.7097333333333;-105.12885

Two bright hovering lights pulsated and grew brighter before eventually getting dimmer and disappearing. ((anonymous report));2017-11-07 18:00:00;00:05:00.00;Two bright hovering lights pulsated and grew brighter before eventually getting dimmer and disappearing. I can see the planes coming in and heading out of the Denver airport (DIA) from my bedroom window and was watching them for a few minutes after getting in from work when I noticed two brighter solid lights.  Far too low to be stars but no flashing lights or flight pattern to indicate they were a plane or helicopter.  They hovered for a couple minutes before beginning to flicker.  I turned to turn the light in the room off and by the time I looked back,  One was gone and the other was flickering or pulsing.  It continued to grow brighter until eventually getting dimmer over the course of about 30 seconds and fading completely without ever having moved in location at all.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
A light flew in multiple directions, hovered for a couple seconds, and sped off .;2017-12-07 22:00:00;30 seconds;A light flew in multiple directions, hovered for a couple seconds, and sped off . Around 10PM three other friends and I witnessed a light coming from the south of Denver shoot north. At first we thought it was a shooting star. Then it shot back south, appeared above us again and hovered for avout 8 seconds before shooting west. The event happened too quick for it to have been a drone or any airplane. The event was witnessed at 39.702678,-105.154664 to be exact. We were facing east, looking over downtown Denver. I had a flight tracker open on my phone so we could watch planes coming and going from the airports, after checking the radar there was no flights. My friends and I were left speechless, shaking, and cold. It took us a couple minutes to confirm with each other what we just saw. Contact information of other witnesses can be provided.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
I saw 3 lights traveling east as if they were satellites.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-26 21:45:00;5 seconds;I was watching the sky for several minutes watching satellites, clouds, lightning and stars. Then, just east of the big dipper, I saw 3 lights traveling east as if they were satellites traveling together at the same speed and in single file.  I told my wife to look at what I see and she saw them as well.  They the clouds covered them quickly after and I thought they might just be stars together and the moving clouds made them look as if they were moving.  But as I waited for the cloud cover to blow away,  I saw two more lights traveling the same direction but a not in the same area of the sky.  As the cloud cover blew away, I could see some stars, but there weren't any stars close together.  Not sure what I saw, but I have never seen satellites that traveled that close together traveling in the exact same direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Series of lights (not a group, but travalling the same path) moving W to E.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-14 20:00:00;~1 hour;Series of lights (not a group, but travalling the same path) moving West to East t walking the dog with my daughter at about 8 PM when we noticed a light moving across the sky.  It came into vision on the west horizon at approximately the cross at Mt Lindo (the big white cross lights on the mountains) from our location.  It moved up into the sky, moving southwest to northeast in a trajectory between the cross and whatever planet was bright and about 30Â° above the horizon at the time.  It wasn't as bright as the planet and had a similar appearance to a satellite in the atmosphere.  It caught our attention because it moved much faster than a satellite or an airplane, was either far to small or high to be an airplane, and it made no noise.  When we lost site of the first light, qe noticed another emerging on the horizon from the same place, on the same path.  When we lost site or the second, a third appeared.  Came up from the same place, on the same path.  Scattered thin clouds moving through at the time began to make it more difficult to continually track the lights, but over the course of about an hour we watched as many as nine lights.  During the same time, planes traveled through and were easily distinguishable from these lights.  The only thing I could compare what we witnessed to would be missiles or rockets.  I've lived in this area for a very long time and am quite familiar with how air traffic moves through our airspace, at high altitudes and lower elevations.  Aircraft in this area NEVER follow the same flight path so closely with the exception of either taking off or landing.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
