Vehicle appeared to be round, with a triangle array of 3 lights on leading edge of bottom. Saw from approximately 200 feet away hovering at about 60 feet for almost 10 minutes.. First believed it to be a police helicopter, but from our vantage point high over Denver,it departed with no sound at an astounding rate of speed past the Denver airport in the distance in maybe 3 seconds. It made no sound while hovering or departing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Triangle shaped lights moving very very fast;1998-11-12 21:30:00;5 sec.;Triangle shaped lights moving very very fast I did not know about this forum until recently. I am posting an incident that happened a couple of years ago. I was outside of a restaraunt waiting for my family to come out after dinner and I was looking at the clouds in the night sky and I noticed three white steady lights in a triangle pattern moving at an incredible rate of speed in and out of the clouds absolutely silent. I was at approx. 5500 feet in elevation and this craft must have been at 12,000 feet or more. At that altitude it traversed the sky from the time I saw it to its dissapearance in about 5 seconds! I dont know of any aircraft that I have seen from the ground travel that fast. It looked so unnatural to what I am used to seeing that it still confuses me in regards to what I saw that night.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885

So my son and I stood up and I noticed a triangle shape of lights with orange/reddish lights coming towards us from the North, going south.  It was moving very slowly.   It was about 30 feet from the ground.  It almost blended in with the sky if it wasn’t for the dim reddish lights I wouldn’t have seen it.   As it went by extremely silent I tried looking at the flying craft itself the triangle was semi-invisible, you could see a triangle shape but not every detail.   Pardon the pun but like the clocking device on star track when they first start to go invisible or when they are taking the clock down.   It felt like I was dreaming while I watched this craft go by us, then it glided more to the South past us and it was it disappeared into the sky because of its black color and dim lights.  We couldn’t see it any longer. When it was gone all I could keep saying was that was amazing.   My son started saying he didn’t want to be abducted, he was frightened after seeing that.  My husband and I were in amazement.  I drew a picture of what I saw.  The picture isn’t a perfect image of it  I am not an artist but it’s what we saw that night, we will never forget.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Triangular, dimly-lit craft that made no noise and flew slowly.;2013-01-27 18:50:00;1 minute;Triangular, dimly-lit craft that made no noise and flew slowly. On my way to work, I noticed a triangle shape quickly approaching me from the north.  It was around 200 feet up in the air, closer than any aircraft I see flying in this area on a daily basis.  It was a large right triangle shape, with dimly lit lights that were dome shaped - spaced about a thumb width apart if I were to hold my hand up to it. These lights went all the way around the craft.  The space in the middle was black (it blocked out the stars).  It was a clear night, no wind or clouds for miles.   It flew over my head, heading south.  I would estimate at about 30-40 miles per hour.  I told my friends and family about it.  My sister told me today that one of her co-workers who lives in my area saw it too on his drive in to work. It made no noise, and i watched it until the lights were no longer visible (estimating 2-3 miles away).  The lights were a really dim beige color, no other colors or flashing of any sort.  They seemed to be illuminating from within and were almost hard to see.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Traingular shaped object, looked like a giant bird.  NO SOUND.;2014-10-26 21:15:00;5 seconds;Traingular shaped object, looked like a giant bird. NO SOUND My girlfriend and I were on a walk this evening in Lakewood walking towards Colfax (heading south) at around 9:15.  I was doing a little sky gazing as we walked and happened to notice a large object that looked like a giant prehistoric bird.  I would guesstimate that it was flying at around 5,000 feet.  I said what the hell is that? to my girlfriend and she quickly looked up and just in time to see it fade behind the tree line.   We were both a little shaken by it and spent a good amount of time sitting in a park with low lighting in the area staring at the sky in the hopes of seeing it again. Neither of us are really ones that believe in UFOs or anything like that. I, having military experience believe it to be some sort of military secret, especially considered all the military bases of operation down South in Colorado (NORAD, Ft. Carson).  With that being said, I've never seen anything, experimental, stealth, regular military aircraft that looked anything similar.  IT MADE NO SOUND.  I thought I saw faint lights, however, if there were any they were just barely visible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Silent, huge triangular black craft with 3 faint red lights in a line across the back and markings on the bottom.;2016-10-17 19:50:00;<20 seconds;Silent, huge triangular black craft with 3 faint red lights in a line across the back and markings on the bottom. I was looking up at the stars in front of my apartment complex, when I saw a VERY large, triangular black craft.  I thought it was a Stealth bomber then I realized it was absolutely silent, 4 times as big, and had only 3 very faint lights in a row on the back.  No flashing lights, no normal-colored airplane or jet lights.  It went from north to south, across the entire sky, in under 10 seconds.  I could see the entire outline while it was overhead, I saw a complex pattern on the bottom.  Absolutely no noise.  We do not live in any type of flight patterns, we do see and hear planes from Denver International Airport occasionally, less than one per day.  And we always hear them.  We are not bear any Air Force bases, there's the training academy in Oloradon Springs, and one in Aurora, but I've only seen and heard military jets once in 3 years.  My husband and I have.  Even married for 9 years, I managed to yell at him and he saw the last 2 seconds of the craft before it blended in with the dark night sky.  We both work full time, never been in any sort of legal trouble, we have no kids, we're pretty laid back and low key.  We were also completely sober.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885

They stopped and a set of 3 white v shaped lights with the points facing inward was witnessed. The set of lights appeared from out of nowhere. A basketball was bounced to distract. Then a red dot was pointed at 2 other witnesses. I told them then we left the park for the night. Entities were then made close contact in the later parts of the week.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
