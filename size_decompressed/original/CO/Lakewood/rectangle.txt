My husband,and I were on our way home, we were stopped at a stop light. At the stop light we observed, in the northwest sky a very bright white light that was rectangular in shape, heading in a westerly direction.  It was observed between one power line and it approximately filled that space. The lenght was approximately three to four times the width.  It did not appear to be moving but instead the rotation of the earth covered it with a small dark cloud for about 8 to 10 seconds, and then as the earth continued to move it went behind the mountain.  The sky had dark small clouds and the sun was not shinning.  Where there were no clouds the sky was a dull bluish gray.  The front of the object appeared to be flat and as we looked towards the end of the object the bright white grew fainter and the end looked some what like a thinning tail.  It's trajectory appeared to be flat and parelell with the earth.  The overall size of the object was about one third of a full moon.  Ini! tially, we thought it was a contrail, however, the size was too large, it was too bright a white, and it did not dissapate.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Four lights viewed from Lakewood, CO.;2013-12-12 18:15:00;20 minutes;Four lights viewed from Lakewood CO 12.12.2013.  6:15PM  At approximately 6:15PM I saw a bright light coming from a northerly slant,  I thought I was watching a comet. It burst into 4 separate lights with tails like one would see on a comet.  I called my grandson to see, we stood looking out the window (looking eastward). We watched, for about 20 minutes, as the lights moved about, at times with the comet like tails and at times very clearly four separate lights.  They moved in circles for a bit and then lined up straight.  One moved and then just disappearedthen a moment later reappeared.  We watched the lights move along the horizon just above the trees, and then one by one they sank behind the trees and vanished. I contacted an astronomer at an observatory and he suggested they were fireworks – these were NOT fireworks, or laser pointers.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
rectangular ufo seen flying overhead, while driving down residential street in Lakewood, Colorado;2015-10-17 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;rectangular ufo seen flying overhead, while driving down residential street in Lakewood, Colorado I was driving down 1st Avenue towards Sheridan, from Wadsworth.  I noticed what I thought was an extremely bright star in the sky.  It struck me as odd because I didn’t see any other stars in the sky that night.  I was driving so I couldn’t look very closely, but I kept glancing at it and realized it was flying.  I assumed it was a plane.   Then, I stopped at a red light and was able to really look.  I realized that instead of two lights on the wings, like a plane has, it was one solid band of extremely bright light.  It was coming in faster than a plane, and flying too low.  As it came closer, and was about to fly over me I saw that the band of light was coming from the bottom of the ship, not the front.  It was gliding rather than flying.  I saw it from a slightly diagonal angle when it came really close and noticed it was an extremely flat craft, with a bronze like top and darker outer edges.  I looked straight up at the bottom of it when it flew by, and it was covered in many very large bright lights, shining out from behind some sort of see through pane.  It kept flying in that direction, and that is all I saw.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
