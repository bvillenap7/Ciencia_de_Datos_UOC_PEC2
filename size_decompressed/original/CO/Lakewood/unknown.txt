Tilted looking Object moving from west to east.  I was on my way to an appointment, and had just turned onto northbound Wadsworth Blvd from Center Ave, in the Belmar area of Lakewood. A second or two after making the turn, I noticed this white line (could have been cylinder, cigar, disc or almost any shape) moving fairly quickly from left to right (west to east) well ahead of me - I estimate at least a few miles, maybe several miles (could have been over Wheat Ridge or Arvada...). As it got further east, the white color dimmed to a gray color, probably from going underneath the shade of a cloud (just a good guess). It was difficult to keep a really good eye on it as I was in rather heavy traffic, which was slowing down as I approached Alameda Ave., so I had to also keep a good eye on the traffic. I lost sight of it as it went out of view (an office building on the NE corner of Wadsworth & Alameda blocked my view). Once the traffic had moved forward enough, past Alameda Ave, I looked for it again, but could not see it, and had to continue to be careful driving. It might have still been there, but harder to see perhaps because it closely matched the color of background clouds? It also would have been getting farther away (farther to the east). I did not have a camera with me, and even if I had had one, I wouldn't have had time to turn it on, aim it and snap pictures while driving in heavy traffic - would have been very unsafe, also. However, I went back to that stretch of Wadsworth Blvd and took 4 pictures, approximating what my views were as I was driving this morning. I then used software to draw in what it looked like to me. I will upload the pictures in the sequence of the viewing you will be able to see it as a white, angled line, west of Wadsworth and roughly above a bank building on the left side of the street, past Alameda Ave. The 3rd and 4th pictures show how it dimmed to gray as it moved farther east. I was on the phone with a friend this afternoon and told him about it. He a! sked me if it could have been an airplane banking in a turn. No, it could not have been that if it had been that, it would have not appeared to move relative to my position, as it would more or less be flying away or toward me, not moving to my right (east), and it maintained this tilt throughout is movement eastward. If it was an airplane, then this would mean that the nose of the plane was inclined about 45 degrees, the nose pointing up and the tail pointing down. When a plane is landing at an airport, the nose is slightly raised so that the rear landing gear touch down, then the nose lowers and the forward gear touch down. This was a much greater angle. If it was a plane, then something must have been very wrong and the passengers would have been very uncomfortable, to say the least. So, no, I don't believe it was an airplane. If it wasn't an airplane, what was it?;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Silver Object, flashing and floating in place. Commercial Flight Altitude.;2010-07-29 09:00:00;10 Minutes;Silver Object, flashing and floating in place. Commercial Flight Altitude. To the West, over the Rockie Mountains, I saw a grey/silver object floating stationary at my best guess around 30,000 ft. It was near commercial flight altitude. Too high for a helicopter, and not moving at all, unlike a flare, missile, or Satellite. It would periodically and randomly flash a bright white light at me, as bright as a super bright iredean flare. Not in any kind of consistent order like FAA lights. Every now and again it looked like the light shown right at me. Atleast in my direction. Over the course of about 10 minutes it started to slowly move off to the North where I couldn't see it anymore. I took pictures and video of the object. I can't see it yet, but I haven't put it in Photoshop to blow it up and clean it up yet. But I did notice 2 round very strange lense blurs on my camera. Almost look like if you were to look down into a cone of water. Only when I shot photo's of the object did these blurs show up...;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
Bright white light traveling across sky turns red then gone.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite??  PD));2010-09-11 21:15:00;1 min 15 sec;Bright white light traveling across sky turns red then gone At 9:15 pm mountain time witness a bright white light traveling at a high rate of speed from the west to east.   The object had no other running lights as typical aircraft due and no sound. The object seemed to zig zag as it made itâ€™s way across the sky then suddenly stop for around ten seconds then turned from white to a red color and vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite??

3 bright white lights in the sky over Lakewood 80228.;2013-06-28 22:20:00;unknown;3 bright white lights in the sky over Lakewood 80228 I saw three bright white lights on storm clouds to the south of our house in Lakewood, CO.  They circled closely together, then spread apart, and then came back together, and one more time spread apart before disappearing.  At first, I thought they were spotlights, but there was not a point of origin visible to me from the ground, and there were not beams visible.  It also was not lightning, although there was a lot of activity in the sky tonight.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
UFO emitting bright blue and white light traveling East to West right over the overpass (10 ft) on Garrison at a fast pace (&lt15 s);2014-06-19 23:06:00;45 seconds;UFO emitting bright blue and white light traveling East to West right over the overpass (10 ft) on Garrison at a fast pace (~15 s) We were driving down Garrison, and right before the overpass, an object passed going from east to west.  It was bright and something my friend and I had never seen before. It was really bright with white and blue lights.  There is no way to describe the shape. A bunch of parallel lines emitting bright lights.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885

It was moving slowly (similar to the speed of a commercial airliner.  By the way, there were five commercial jets surrounding the Denver metro area at the time.   I happened to be watching the sky and counting the number of jets I could see at one time.   This particular 'jet' was moving toward me, but it struck me as odd that the light of an approaching jet was red.  They are always white.  Now, I realize that is sometimes difficult to ascertain whether an object is approaching or going away from you.  That's not my point.  The point is, the speed at which this object switched directions was 10x the speed.  It was then fast flashing white.  I then video captured more of these rapid switching movements.  The video quality from my iphone is grainy, but I have video.  Was it a drone?  Not sure.  I am willing to send video if I knew how.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
