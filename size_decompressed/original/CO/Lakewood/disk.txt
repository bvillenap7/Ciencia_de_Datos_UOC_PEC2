Four objects dissapear before our eyes.;2004-05-31 14:30:00;20 seconds;Four objects dissapear before our eyes. Sitting on the back patio at my sisters house we looked up and saw 4 objects in the sky, fluttered around for a while and then took off. It happened so fast that it was the topic of discussion for the rest of the day.  All of us that seen it described the exact same thing.  We saw them change direction within a blink of the eye and then they dissappeared in the sky.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885

Bright light leveling off in to a bright sphere than headed off than disappearing suddenly.;2011-12-12 01:00:00;4 minutes or so;Bright light leveling off into a bright sphere than headed off than disappearing suddenly. I was letting dogs out in the exercise yard behind an Animal Hospital.  Normally I do not do it this early but because we had no patients this night I could go home early.  I was standing in a stairwell watching the dog I had let out when I noticed the bright light.  It was between 1:30 Am and 2 Am.  I saw only 1 unidentified object. First I saw a bright light, thought it was a chopper but than noticed no sounds.  Even though the light shined directly on me nothing was lit up as far as myself or the area around me.  The object in question went further away with the bright light facing me, than like  leveled out  and  started going in a  sort of a northwest direction  than  it  just disappeared without getting smaller.  Like  someone turned the lights off.  It was kind of overcast up in the sky.  I took the pictures on my cell phone and sent them to my PC and didn't relize what I really saw till I looked at them on my PC.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
UFO caught on camera;2020-03-30 22:50:00;5 minutes;UFO caught on camera I just took a video of the ufo tonight. It was the best I could do with my phone's camera but the light in between the two street lights is a UFO I was able to record it until it dimmed it's light till it disappeared entirety. I don't know for sure if it was moving at all, my eyes may have been playing tricks on me. However, I swear, when this thing turned it's light off, I know I could make out a huge saucer shaped object for a split second afterwards.  Then nothing, poof it was gone.  Wish everyone could see this thing exactly how I had seen it in person;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
