A year previous my daughters friend was histerical while walking her dog at same complex , said a light from a space ship was trying to suck her up. We were skeptical but once we saw the craft we then knew she was very serious. One thing, there was low cloud cover on both days so when ever there are low clouds I get scared.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885

Witnessed unknown craft at about 8 p.m., while picnicing.  Children saw craft first and calle dout ALIENS!!  Adults came out from under pavilion to see craft.  Craft appeared to be a perfect circle with tubes of brightly colored-richly colored light radiating from its center. Lights flickered very quickly. Colors were blue, red green and yellow.   I saw only a flat dimension and could not make out a shape above the lighted circle.  It floated quietly seemed very close (i.e. tall building height) over Stone House Park in Lakewood moved ESE at first and then gained speed and altitude changed direction to SE and then S, and WSW, all the while gaining great altitude.  Craft came very near to cloud, or entered cloud and seemed to cause bright flash lightning.  I heard no thunder.  The flash lightning seemed to start and stop in corrolation with the craft.

Round white craft shot blue beam towards second similar craft which sped away.;2011-07-08 22:00:00;10 seconds;Round white craft shot blue beam towards second similar craft which sped away. On or around August 11, 2011, I was sitting in my backyard in Lakewood, Colorado, with 3 other people.  We were enjoying the clear night sky and looking at the stars.  We were also watching for possible UFO’s.  I was looking to the east (as was one of my friends) and I spotted a small round white object moving south.   I pointed and asked my friend if he saw anything and before he could answer my question I saw a thin blue beam of light shoot out from the white object.  The beam was aimed towards the south.   At the same instant that I saw the blue beam I saw another similar small round white object that was located slightly to the south of the first object take off at a high rate of speed to the south.   The object that shot the blue beam continued on its original path to the south and did not change its original speed.  It eventually moved out of my sight line.   I turned to my friend and asked if he had seen that.  He shook his head yes and looked stunned.  Then he described exactly what I had just seen and we were both amazed.  No one else in the group saw the incident. My background is in education and I taught children and adults for 30 years.  I am now retired.  My friend worked for the Federal Government before retiring. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.7097333333333;-105.12885

Circular gold craft with pulsating orange and red light dead center.;2016-07-03 23:30:00;2 minutes;Circular gold craft with pulsating orange and red light dead center. I observed the first craft approaching in the sky at approx 500 to 750 feet in altitude, circular in shape, gold in color, with a pulsating red and orange light in the center.  It made no sound at all, and moved from the west to the east on a linear path at a speed of about 150 to 200 mph.   Never changing it's path, it traveled over my location and over the city of Denver and was joined by a second craft exactly the same, which had been traveling parallel to the first craft slightly to the north.  Both craft seemed to come closer together past Denver to the east, and then turned south and moved out of my view.   The first craft flew right over my house clearly in my view, and was moving in a purposeful way directly east.  Again, it made no sound at all.   I did not have my phone with me at the time.  I wish I had a picture of it.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
