Cigar shaped craft with a trail behind it;2021-01-19 19:19:00;30 seconds;Cigar shaped craft with a trail behind it I was out walking my dog when I looked to the NW in the sky. At first, I thought it was a plane but it looked like there was a tail to it and I didn't see any of the usual lights like those of a plane. It was a cigar shaped craft.  It also looked as if it was a deep golden color. It was moving straight across the sky.  It was moving east towards the Denver airport so I just thought it had to be a plane. I live under the West flight pattern so I see planes a lot and something about this one just didn't sit right. It also didn't have the speed as if it was going to land or had taken off from the airport. It was moving much slower than the planes I'm used to seeing. I'm about 35 miles to the west of DIA. There also was a plane directly to the north of the craft, almost as if it was following the plane. Almost side by side and the craft was slightly to the southwest if I was to put myself in that plane.  I glanced down for a split second and when I looked back up to look at the object, it was gone. I searched the sky for it but could not locate it.  Maybe it was a meteor? Or even a falling star? Whatever it was had me baffled and wanting to report this.;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
