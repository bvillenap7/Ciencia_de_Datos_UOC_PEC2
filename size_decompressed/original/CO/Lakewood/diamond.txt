Return trip home and walking into yard when suddenly 200-400 ft up (best guess) 9 delta shaped ufo's appear flying in a V formation.  3 of the fliers exchanged places.  They had a orange/blue glow to them, they were silent.  It's night time birds don't fly here at night, except bats and owls.   They traveled from the north to south and suddenly vanished (blinked out) before flying out of line of sight.  The exactness of those fliers that switched places, one moving out, the next moved nimble, agile into the others exact place.  We've seen ufo's never this close before.  No sound....... still astonished.  WoW Wow wow;39.7097333333333;-105.12885
