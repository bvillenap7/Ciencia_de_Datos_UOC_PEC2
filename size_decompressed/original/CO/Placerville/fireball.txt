Purplish-green object near Telluride, Colorado in early morning hours.;2013-09-07 02:35:00;15 seconds;Purplish-green object near Telluride, Colorado in early morning hours. Heading into Telluride from Montrose, I had witnessed a purple and green object (almost the shape of a fireball but seemed like it had more of a circular shape that was defined).  I was approaching Hwy 62 from 145 south.  Object appeared on the horizon of the Mountain tops in front of me.  It went straight into the air upwards in motion. It then stopped when high in the air and went straight west till out of sight in a high rate of speed.  Its first appearance was about the size of the moon.  The center was green in color turning purple to the outside.  The radio station playing in the shuttle van had a strange humming while the object was going up.  When high in the sky its color seemed almost white with an orange hue.  It took only a couple seconds for it to appear the size of a pencil tip while in its upward motion when it stopped before turning in a westerly direction.;38.0175;-108.0556
