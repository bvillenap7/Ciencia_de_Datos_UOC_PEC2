Reddish, round object in Southeast sky in Snowmass Village, CO;2011-10-08 22:00:00;3 minutes;Reddish, round object in Southeast sky in Snowmass Village, CO At about 22:00 hours on 10/08/11, I saw a reddish, round object in the sky to the Southeast of Snowmass Village, CO. It was about 45 degrees above the horizon.  It was larger than any stars in the sky, and it appeared as though it was moving from South to North.   I watched it for about 3 minutes. In that time, the object moved slightly left and right.  After about three minutes, the object appeared to move toward the East, Southeast, and it faded from view. There were high, thin clouds in the area.  The clouds were not thick enough to obscure brighter stars of the moon.;39.2236;-106.9279
