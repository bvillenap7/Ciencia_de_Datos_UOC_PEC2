My location was a mountainside in the Roaring Fork Valley.  The activity continued for at least one hour.  At one point a plane passed through the area and one of UFOs chased it briefly, then peeled off.  The lights seemed to bounce and moved at speeds far beyond the capability of any aircraft I’m aware of.  A report has been turned in to local television news...I don’t know the source of the report.  There is a military base in the general vicinity of this recent UFO activity.;39.2236;-106.9279
