I woke very early in the morning and was drawn by what I could see of the view in moonlight.  When I reached the window, I looked toward the sky and, before a canopy of stars, was a bright shallow disk with lights on the bottom like the inside of the roof of a merry go round with fluorescent tubes lighting up and un-lighting in a random pattern.  The object was otherwise blue-ish, silver-ish, almost like plastic glow in the dark material.  It was as though you could see through it.  It was large looking but that was because it was close relative to an airplane.  It stayed above just and off a corner of the roof.  I had time to go get a camera, but it had already moved off a distance and at that time I saw two lights moving west along the top off the mountain range.  My photos are interesting but not definitive.  It made no sound.  It left no exhaust that I could see.  If it was truly extra-terrestrial, I feel privileged.;39.2236;-106.9279
