My friend snapped a photo of the darkened image of the plane.   I saw nothing between us and the plane except mist. Later, we saw the photo and quite clearly there is a large, what I would decribe as a lit candle sitting on a translucent dish.  The photo shows six distinct balls of light: a red with a bright yellow center on top, a white and another white beneath (these three form the candle), a green to the left, an amber on the bottom center, and a white (with light green) on the right side of the craft, all very symmetrical and clearly indicative of an intelligence and purpose.  It appears to be moving upward and is leaving beneath it a very clear vapor trail.  Incredibly clear photo.  The craft appears to have a deep blue glow faintly surrounding it and two small windows with faint green light coming from them.  I am a 50 year old father of four, have been practicing law in Houston, Texas for 25 years and up until 8/4/05, had no interest whatsoever in UFO's and the like.  My friend who took the photo is 48 years old and is a classical musician and the conductor of a chamber orchestra.  We have no agenda of any kind, but we do have proof.  Very clear and convincing proof.  We have an appointment at NASA on Tuesday 8/30/05 to have the photo analyzed.;39.2236;-106.9279
