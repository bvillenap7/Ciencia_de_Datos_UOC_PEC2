We were walking in the neighborhood with our dogs and one of the dogs stopped. We noticed a huge white yellowish light in the sky. It was way bigger than any planet or star, but too far away to tell detail. It looked like a street lamp was suspended in the air. It was moving around, in a straight direction. It went behind a cloud but we could still see some of it and then it disappeared.;39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816

Blue/purple orb seen from North Table in Golden, CO.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-27 01:30:00;30 minutes;Blue/purple orb seen from North Table in Golden, CO. I stepped out onto my front porch and looked into the northeast sky.  I noticed what looked like a blue/purple orb flying in a T shaped pattern.  It flew very slowly, and very directly.  When it changed direction, it did so immediately.  When it first caught my eye around 1am, it was moving to the left, then headed down.  Headed back up, then moved left again.  Stopped for a brief minute, and when it did, it became a semi-solid/pulsating randomly white light.   When it began moving again to the right, it became the blue/purple orb it had been when it first caught my eye.  After moving for a brief moment it stopped, changed to a white light again, and this is where it sat for a solid 20mins.  Then, out of nowhere, it became the blue/purple orb once again, this time moving straight up for a split second, moving significantly faster, and then it was gone.
