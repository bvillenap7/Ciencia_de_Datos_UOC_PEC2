The metallic three pronged upside down teardrop object moved at a constant altitude and velocity Northwest in Golden, Colorado.;2008-05-03 20:25:00;30-40 seconds;The metallic three pronged upside down teardrop object moved at a constant altitude and velocity Northwest in Golden, Colorado. The metallic colored object with the shape of an upside down teardrop with three prongs moved Northwest past the baseball fields at Ulysses Park in Golden, Colorado at approximately 8:25 pm mountain standard time. The object appeared to be moving at the same altitude for the duration of the sighting. The object was roughly 100 feet away and likely 3-5 feet long across the side facing my friend and me. It disappeared from sight after moving at a constant rate of speed for about 30-40 seconds. The object made absolutely no sound. A group of skateboarders sitting about 25 feet away pointed out the object to my friend and me while we played catch as we did not notice it initially. Interestingly, one of the skateboarders made the comment, it's spying on you. My friend and I continued to play catch as the whole event felt somewhat surreal and there wasn't an instantaneous cohesive response by us. However, a few minutes later it grew too dark and we stopped playing catch. At that time we discussed the event and did not know what to make of it. As we walked down to the parking lot below the batting cages we hoped to see the skateboarders to ask them what they honestly thought it was but they were gone. After discussing the event, we postulated the only logical explanation was some sort of runaway kite but the seemingly constant altitude and velocity on a clear and breezeless night made that postulation unlikely to us.
