Rapidly moving V-shaped black object, I detected no noise from object moving south.;2014-10-20 22:00:00;15 seconds;Rapidly moving &quotV&quot shaped black object, I detected no noise from object moving south. V shaped craft, silent and moving rapidly, two rows of dim white lights in shape of V (bottom of craft presumably)  No red lights or blinkers like on commercial flights.  Barely seen against night sky, black or grey in color.  I was out looking for Orionids, lots of airplane traffic, but this snuck in just west of me going south along front range between Golden and mountains (maybe 20,000 feet, not too high, lower than all commercial flights I witnessed).  You see it, try and make sense of what it could be, then realize it made no noise whatsoever and was moving fast.  I had once seen an unexplainable pattern of lights, a long time ago and experienced the missing time, so when I went in last night I checked the clock first thing, so unusual amount of time had past like the lst time.
