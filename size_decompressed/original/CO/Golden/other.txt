Witnessed a Barbell like object that rotated irratically, changed directions several times, and finally dissapeared.;1995-06-06 18:00:00;15 minutes;Summary : Witnessed a Barbell like object that rotated irratically, changed directions several times, and finally dissapeared. I just found this web page, and when I saw the report logs, I excitedly went to June 1995. There is a report of an object seen on the 7th in another state that is remarkably similar to what I observed on June  1995. The other witnesses, who were my co-workers did not report this event, as we did not know how to go about doing so. The following is an account of what we saw. The details are not hazy in my memory, as they are burned into my mind- they could never be forgotten.I work at a Bungee jump tower in Golden CO. I am the supervisor of five employees that run the jump tower each day. At 6pm, one of my employees remarked how the clouds in the sky, when observed from the ground with the backdrop of the tower, made the tower appear to move.(the wind was blowing the clouds) I looked up, along with another employee, and noticed that this was true. Gazing at the sky behind the tower, something caught my eye. At first I thought it was an airplane, as it appeared to be at the same altitude as a plane taking off from DIA would. But then it abruptly changed directions. I pointed this out to the other employees. We then observed the object for about ten or fifteen minutes. The object was reflecting the sunlight, and therefore was flashing in the daytime sun. After five minutes or so, it appeared that the object was getting closer. We could then tell that the object appeared to be a metallic shaft with two round ends, like a barbell. The flashing was cau!sed by the object rotating irratically, and wobbling back and forth. I suggested that it was simply two mylar balloons caught in the wind, but then we noticed the same clouds previously mentioned, and the object was moving opposite these wind blown clouds, ruling out the balloon idea. Then, after approximately seven minutes of observation the object changed directions and headed back the opposite direction. The object did not seem to be getting closer at this point, but we then noticed a faint greyish foggy halo surrounding the object. At this point two customers came to the jump, and inquired as to what we were gaping at. They observed the object as well. After a maximum of fifteen tense minutes of observing this anomoly, the object changed course abruptly, went behind a small, thin, transparent cloud, and dissapeared. I would appreciate any information regarding this sitghting, i.e. whether the similar sighting in your log is of similar circumstances. Since 1995 I have been w!rithing to get this reported, and am very grateful for this service.;39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816
Low flaming meteor with possible ground impact.;2001-08-17 22:45:00;3 sec;Low flaming meteor with possible ground impact. At about 10:45 PM driving west on I-70 near the intersection of I-70 & C-470, (Golden, Colorado) I saw what was most likely a large meteor or Space Junk. It first appeared to me just below the top of my windshield at about a 30 degree angle above the horizon, appearing to flare up at that point to a bright yellow-white color with a long tail and sparks and small chunks breaking off. It was about half to 2/3rds the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. It dropped almost vertically to a point just above the ridgeline of the foothills, and appeared to dim out just before disappearing. While very hard to estimate distance, if I had to venture a guess I would say 5 to 20 miles, though it could have been much further. It looked to me that it very likely hit the ground relatively near Denver. (A call to the USGS for seismic cooberation was quite unsatisfying) I had my hand held GPS operating, and checked the current heading at that time as 201 degrees. I am trying to confirm if that is magnetic or true heading, but the GPS manual does not specify. It appears to be magnetic heading based on my aeronautical chart and the road in that area. The object was just slightly left of straight ahead, so most likely about a 195-200 degree magnetic heading from that intersection. Plotting this on my Denver Area Chart (aeronautical chart), the line runs nearly through Marshdale, Silver Springs, and Bailey Colorado. (If my GPS course turns out to be True Course, shift the line 10 Â½ degrees to the left, but magnetic course looks right on the map). This was one of the most spectacular, low and close objects of this type I have seen, and if my small plane were not in the shop I would go out looking for evidence. It may be possible if able to triangulate or get a seismic location to find a relatively pristine meteor or space debris. I don't know who to contact about meteor impacts, so perhaps you can tell me or pass this on. Perhaps NORAD/Space Command has some info on this object if they will share it with us. ((NUFORC Note:  Map sent by witness.  Curiously, no other reports from this part of Colorado for this date.  However, we presume that this is a high-quality report.

Strange Noise In Golden CO Area;2002-02-19 14:10:00;15 Mins;Strange Noise In Golden CO Area Strange noise in the area of Golden.  It could have been an airraid siren, but I haven't heard of any reports that were given about an airraid siren test.  This happened around 2pm MST on 02/19/2002, we were standing outside of one of the Federal buildings when the so called 'noise' started.  It sounded like wind going through a tight crack but then it changed to sounding like a siren, we couldn't tell.  We were out in the open, and the wind never ever sounded like that.  I was looking for possible aircraft that might have flown overheard but saw nothing. Weather was partly cloudy/mid 50s and a little breezy.  Other than the wind, it was a perfect day.;39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816
Light formation in sky over Golden,CO   01/04/04;2004-01-04 20:00:00;20sec;Light formation in sky over Golden,CO   01/04/04 I was baby sitting for my brother in law, a house painter, mild mannered, father of four, on the night of Sunday, January 4 from about 8:00pm till about 11:00pm. He and his wife went to see a movie. When they returned, My brother in law Anthony offhandedly told me about some lights he saw in the sky immediatly after leaving my house for the movie. They were in a hurry because the movie was starting soon, but they stopped at the stop sign and looked up and they described seeing a hundred or so small lights kind of in an upsidedown swoosh formation. He said, and his wife Misty coroborated him, that the formation drifted slowly from easrt to west for about fifteen seconds while they stared at it. Then it slowly turned north and started morphing into more of an upsidedown U for about 3-5 more seconds before dissapearing. Shortly after the lights vanished they spotted an airplane flying eastbond for DIA traveling signifigantly faster than the light formation did. It was a dark cloudless night and we are over the ridge from Denver so we are sheltered somewhat from it's ground light. There are also no streetlights on my steet so nights are dark and starry. My personal opinion is it was something natural floating in the air, due to it's slow movement. Exhaust from an airplane, the after effects of a meteor, or a firework. ((male name deleted and Misty say it appeared to be as high or higher than the plane was. I'm just curious if any one else saw it or has any idea what it could have been.;39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816

I did not see a definite craft of sorts but heard a very distinct sound.  It felt like an engine.;2016-06-12 17:48:00;30 minutes;I did not see a definite craft of sorts, but heard a very distinct sound.  It felt like an engine.  When I say felt, I mean I was directly under the cloud cover and could tell something was above me.   Whatever it was had ample cloud cover and was moving at a steady pace with lightning and rain.  Granted this is common for the area but the sound that was traveling with the cloud was certainly an anomaly.   I certainly felt there was something above me moving just ahead of the storm.
