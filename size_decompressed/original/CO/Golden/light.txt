Lg bright object sped to ground. Maybe a minute later I saw a bright flash of light(it crashed?) On June 10. 1997 my boyfriend and myself were heading east towards Denver, CO on I70.  we were just coming up to the exit for Golden (exit 261?) when I saw a large bright white object (maybe about the size of a car headlight if it was 1/4 mile away.)  It was going too fast to be a plane.  I don't think it was a metoerite or a shooting star.  It was coming from diretly ahead of us(east) and heading to the left (NW).  It was going at a 45 degree angle.  It looked like it crashed behind the town we could seee from the highway.  About a minute later I saw a flash of light coming from the same town.  The flassh was so bright that the mountain behind the town lite up.  It reminded me of the airport landing lightsssssss, but when I mentioned this to my boyfriend he said if it was airport lights they would repeat not just flash once and disappear.  I looked down at the clock and it was approx. 10:30pm. Unfortunately my bofriend didn't see it.  He thought I was pointing at something else.  The reason I noticed it was that it was a clear night and the object was very bright and moving very quickly.  I forgot to mention that it was round with no visible tail on it.  If we weren't in a hurry we would have gone to look for it.  For the next several days I looked in the papers to see if there was anything about it.  I also asked several people but no one heard of anything.;39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816
Blinking object entering atmosphere.;2001-11-29 18:55:00;3 seconds;Blinking object entering atmosphere. This is an extremely questionable occurance. I was waiting for a friend in a parking lot.  There was a ton of light pollution around.  Target, Safeway, lots of big shopping centers and stores was in the immediate area with huge parking lots. I looked up in the Northern sky.  I was on Colfax Avenue at Quail.  As I looked up, I spotted this ball light which was white around and an undetermined color in between the white.  This blinked and flashed as it must have entered the atmosphere.  However, it did not leave a tail behind!  This looked very very similar to a space craft entering the atmosphere but didn't see any recordings of occurance of this date and time especially anything heading northward! I was curious if there was another meteor shower going on, but there was no record that I could find of that either.  The reason I ask this, is that there were a couple other objects of same style of craft that must have entered the atmosphere.  Has anyone looked into this?;39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816
MUFON/COLORADO REPORT:   9 obj's that appeared to be bright hovering lights, then lit up, dimmed, moved to the E and began blinking.;2005-12-20 17:25:00;hour and a half on and of;9 objects that appeared to be bright hovering lights, then lit up, dimmed, moved to the east and began blinking. A friend and I were watching TV when around 5:27 he went out to the balcony of my apartment for a smoke.  I live up on a hill on the border of Golden and Lakewood that overlooks Denver and its suburbs to the north.   He knocked on the window for me to come and look at something.  I am a MUFON Investigator so I watch the skies often.  He pointed out a bright greenish light in the sky to the NNE.  It was just sitting there perfectly still.  I thought it looked very strange so I grabbed my binoculars.  He then pointed out that there were actually 4 objects.  All of them were still.   That looked even more interesting so I grabbed my video camera.  Once I got out there with the camera they began moving.  When I got my camera on them there were three left.  The forth had moved off to the east.  When I began video taping one object began to move off to the east, and one to the west.  The one to the west then came back moving to the east.  Then while filming the remaining light, which was perfectly still, just its right and above it another light lit up.  Soon after, the bottom light lit up very brightly.  When it got very bright, it appeared like an angled disk shape.  It then began to move to the east like the rest and dim out.  All of them did this when they flew easy and as they got dimmer they also began to blink.  The remaining light did the same thing.  It began to get extremely bright, and then it began moving east.   Here again it would get dimmer and begin to blink.  This can all be seen on the tape.  As it moved to the east, I noticed yet another light appear the same place the last one had appeared.  This one was dimmer and began move to the east blinking immediately.  When the tress got in the way I stopped filming.  However, we could see at least two of the light off in the distance over Denver.  Then after a few minutes they began to fade too dim to see.  At this point I called the Director of Investigations to let him know what we saw.  That call was made at about 5:55. While on the call at about 6:15, my friend could see another light appearing in the same spot they had appeared before.  I got off the phone and went back with the camera, however right when I got the camera on it, it faded very dim.  My friend saw another one of them over Denver that was lighting up very bright again.  Again once I got the camera on it, it faded out.  Because I thought they might be reacting to the camera I put it away.  A couple minutes later another light appeared where the others had.  This time, this one stayed still.  It looked like it actually was two light side by side.  As it sat there another light began to light just below it to the left.  The light appearing looked very disk shaped through the binoculars.  After 30 seconds or so as it finally seemed to be finished appearing or whatever it was doing and they both moved to the east.  One headed east over Denver, the other seemed to keep a regular distance from us and moved in an arc to the east with us in the middle.  Once it got due south of us, it just seemed to hover out there.  We then noticed one out over Denver.  This one seemed to be east of downtown and it had two lights, one at either end.  It moved south and appeared very large for as far away it was.  I would say about half the size of a dime at arms length.  The light towards the front was brighter, and eventually the light at the back began to pulse.  It eventually dimmed out.  We could see one of the light heading east still, but after a couple minutes it began to get too dim also.  At this point the light to the south was no longer visible either.  In total we saw nine of these objects and got seven on tape.  You can look for yourself, but it does not appear that these objects had the characteristics of any known craft.  The closest would be a helicopter, but that would not explain why some appeared to come out of no where, and why they seemed solid at first.  It also would not explain the apparent disk shape.  Two other things I would like to note, although they seem extraordinary is that they seemed to react to being video taped, and they seemed to intentionally blink to mimic airplanes.

There were 7 vivid, gark green star like lights in the sky in the southwest direction.  ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??   PD));2015-12-14 21:00:00;3 hours;There were 7 vivid, gark green star like lights in the sky in the southwest direction. I was in my bed at home, around 9:00.  I looked out the window (facing west) and noticed some strange lights, there we're 4 lights that looked like stars in the south west direction. However, these were no stars seeing as these lights were a vibrant, dark, green.    I looked it up and saw that it is impossible for a star to be green, plus not all of them were being covered by clouds.  3 out of the 4 had disappeared, maybe by clouds?  So now afraid that I was running out of time I asked my sister to come up stairs and look at them.  She confirmed the light and as she was looking I saw 3 more of the same lights exept these ones were closer to the horizon and dawned just above a roof top.  These ones are a lot harder to spot than the first one I saw from the original 4.   Again, these look like stars ans twinkle but are a green color and not all are being covered by clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses may have been looking at twinkling stars.  PD));39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816

Blue/white Orb spotted on Lookout Mountain;2017-12-02 01:00:00;1 second;blue/white Orb spotted on Lookout Mountain We drove from Boulder to Lookout Mountain.  We arrived at our spot at 39°43'51.9N 105°14'28.4W. (Facing West)  We sat there listening to music for a couple hours, when all of the sudden out of the corner of my eye I saw a white/blue light hovering between two trees (it was not the reflection of car headlights, because those reflections always followed the same horizontal pattern, when I looked at the light it was just hovering there.)  I looked to see what this light was that caught my eye, as did the person sitting next to me.  Together we saw an orb.  It looked to be about 100 feet from the vehicle.  As soon as we looked at it, it zipped straight down behind the hill.  We didn't see it again.;39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816
