Several reflective flying objects, making strange formations w/liquid like motion in broad daylight near Rocky Flats (Have Photos).;2006-04-12 13:51:00;5 mins;Several reflective flying objects, making strange formations w/liquid like motion in broad daylight near Rocky Flats (Have Photos). Was Driving North on Highway 93 coming from Golden heading towards Boulder. About 2 miles S. of Rocky Flats. Saw a group of reflective objects making different formations (very high up) in the sky slightly NW of my vehicle. They were moving in what I can only describe as a liquid type motion. Kind of like mercury. They moved in unison. The group split in half w/one half of the group mirroring the other half's motion. It was very strange, so I pulled over on the side of the highway and tried to get a better look. They were very reflective and all seemed to be identical. The objects were slowly dancing in that liquid motion over head for about 5 Min's. They then made a formation of a triangle (not a V) and jetted off very quickly headed NW (more West than North) and were gone. Anyone else in the area on this date see anything similar? Have digital photos.;39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816
Advanced light patterns turning in sharp angles and moving at high speeds in a fluid manner that no known human aircraft could handle.;2013-07-04 21:40:00;~5 minutes;Advanced light patterns turning in sharp angles and moving at high speeds in a fluid manner that no known human aircraft could handle. A couple friends and I (3 people total) decided to climb up Green Mountain to view all of Denverâ€™s fireworks for the 4th. We could see all of Denver from about Alameda North.   At about 9:40 PM (21:40) we saw 6-8 really bright lights traveling in an oval pattern in the sky.  Using our geographical reference, they looked to be above Arvada or Westminster.  They were moving quicker and more fluid like than any other aircraft I had observed.   The circling oval pattern abruptly stopped after about 10 - 20 seconds.  Now only 4 lights remained and they quickly shuffled around each other in their own unique oval shaped patterns. After about 5 seconds of this the lights reduced down to three in which they formed a triangle in the sky. The lights then began to weave in and out of each other, yet always returning back to the original triangle shape.  The sharp degree turns that these crafts would turn at was remarkable they could flip a direct 180 degree turn at a really high velocity as if momentum was not a factor.   This triangular light pattern lasted for about 20 seconds until 2 suddenly disappeared as if flying north at a really fast speed.   The last light remained for a while longer, the departure of this light was observed as if it were shrinking in size and dimming in luminescence to blend with the city street lights until we could see it no longer.  We potentially considered this last beam of light to have landed as it sunk to blend in with the city lights.   All three individuals can vet for what they saw on the mountain that day, and we all agree that these air crafts were far more advanced than anything we have seen in the skies before.  It was a very inspiring and beautiful spectacle we were graced with.;39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816
Several lights in a V formation flew over head at a steady but slow pace, from N to S.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-11 23:40:00;3 minutes;While watching for meteriods, I watched  several lights in a V formation flew over head at a steady, but slow, pace moved from North to south.  The craft made no sound as it passed by. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.7598265306123;-105.220002040816
