Flashing metallic objects not exhibiting typical flight charactaristics of any known aircraft I or anyone else there has ever seen.;2008-11-03 13:10:00;15 minutes;Flashing metallic objects not exhibiting typical flight charactaristics of any known aircraft I or anyone else there has ever seen. At approximately 1:15pm on 11/3/08 I was outside and looked up and saw three metallic-like objects traveling at the same speed heading North.  After a couple of minutes, 2 of the objects abruptly stopped int heir tracks and the third continued north and that one subsequently came to an abrupt hault about thirty seconds later.   About a minute after all three were stationary, the first two that had stopped suddenly began to in circular motions and zig-zag motions, moving quickly in one direction then stopping quickly, then suddenly accellerating in another direction and stopping abriptly again.  This dancing lasted for roughly 5 minutes.   Then a cluster of four more identical objects appeared in the sky just south of the other three and were traveling in what some might call a formation.  almost as if they were connected.  But then they began to act independently swooping up and down, left and right as if they were in a dogfighting scene out from the movie Top Gun.   They then disappeared into the cirus clouds and did not reappear after watching the sky for another 10 minutes.
