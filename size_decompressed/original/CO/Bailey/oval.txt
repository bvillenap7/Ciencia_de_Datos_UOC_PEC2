Before going to bed I went out to check the horses and feed a little hay. As always I look up at the stars but the clouds had rolled in making star watching nearly impossible. A few starts shown through the clouds in between the breaks. As I was walking from the barn with hay to throw to the horses when I notice to the North this bright blue light coming down from the sky in an odd snake-like fashion, disappearing behind the hills miles away. Less then 5 minutes later it reappeared and was climbing back into the sky in the same snake-like motion to the North and West. There was enough of a break in the clouds to see this. This thing was huge, bright and bluish in color and had no tail like a meteor would have. It skirted about the hill tops just west of here... I couldn't make out any shape other then a bright blue light. This afternoon I was talking to a friend of mine who is also a night owl computer person and he was out doing likewise at 3AM over in Rivertown Utah. He described the same thing but it was to the east of him and over the Wassatch Mts. he had nearly clear skies from his point of view. I have a friend who works  as a Country Western personality for Waitt Media in Vail Colorado. I take care of his place here in Bailey Colorado and communicated what I saw last night in my daily eMail to him. He said the News Services carried a segment on an object seen over Utah, Wyoming and Colorado.;39.4497;-105.4692
