Colorado 10/03/06;2006-10-03 19:00:00;10-15 minutes;Colorado 10/03/06 On the night of Tuesday 10/03/06 around sunset in Bailey, Colorado looking north, north/east. I noticed out the corner of my eye out the window these 2 lights hovering over the mountains. I went to look out the window figuring it was planes, and I was thinking, what are those planes doing so close to each other? Then I relized they werent moving at all. I went to get some binoculars for a better look and then I notced that each one had three diff. lights on the sides and infact were not moving. after watching them for about 10-15 minutes, they started to slowly follow eachother north and then quickly disseapeared., strange, I didnt know what to think of it!;39.4497;-105.4692
