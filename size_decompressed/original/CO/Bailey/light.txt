Object shined light on us after signaling SOS with a flashlight.;2012-05-29 03:23:00;10 Seconds;Object shined light on us after signaling SOS with a flashlight. After star gazing for hours, a friend and I witnessed a light moving across the sky at a high rate of speed.  The light was not an airplane or helicopter as the light appeared to be the size of the stars and was moving incredibly fast.  While tracking it with binoculars, I shined SOS at the object.  The object flashed a light back at my friend and I.  The object shined a light at us four separate times while moving across the sky.  The object quickly was out of view and nothing further happened after.  The entire night we saw several shooting stars and satellites, none of which shined lights on us.

Bright white satellite light, stopping and swerving extremely organically for minutes.;2012-06-09 04:00:00;3 minutes;Bright white satellite light, stopping and swerving extremely organically for minutes. We saw what looked to be a satellite only brighter.  It may have been more than a point but it was a perfect white.  It suddenly stopped -- and started swerving around, holding position and swerving again. It did this for a few minutes and when it got close to the horizon, it popped out the light.   It was heading south south-east between 3 and 4:30 am.  We did not have the time with us.  Two campmates were with me at the time and we talked to at least two other individuals who saw it as well.  One of the folks we talked to had seen it several hours before us (with at least eight other people) and had a striking similar description.  Potential for many folks to have seen it.;39.4497;-105.4692
