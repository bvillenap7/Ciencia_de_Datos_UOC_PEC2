Egg shaped object hovering over the foothills looking NE from Burland Meadows section of Bailey.;2018-03-08 16:47:00;3 minutes;Egg shaped object hovering over the foothills looking north east from Burland Meadows section of Bailey. Watched it a few minutes to see if it'd move, which it didn't.  Had this weird, creepy feeling like I never felt before that it was watching me.   I went in to get binoculars to try get a better look.  When came back out it was gone.;39.4497;-105.4692
