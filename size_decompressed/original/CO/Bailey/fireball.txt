I was watching a movie in my livingroom @ 22:00 when I noticed out my window a very bright bluish-white streak of light to 20 degrees SSW at about 40 degrees angle up and moving vertically down to the horizon where it dissappeared from view.  It lasted less than 2 seconds and due to the angle of travel I ran outside thinking it may have been a meteor which could have hit or come close to it.  Though I was not looking directly at the event, it did appear to have a tail of some sort and seemed to be relatively close to my geographic location.  It was a cloudless, moonlit night and visibility was excellent from my home at 9200 feet elevation.  If further contact with me is necessary please contact me via the information below.  I'm curious if it was witnessed by anyone else.  Thank You...;39.4497;-105.4692
