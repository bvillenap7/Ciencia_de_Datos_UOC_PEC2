Through binoculors can see large disk shaped over mountain in same general location with 3 or 4 other small crafts.  We are looking over mountain range that is in Colorado Springs  area possibly in the area of NORAD.  Very interesting!! We are just curious and would like to know what they were.;39.4497;-105.4692

When I looked up in the northwest sky I saw a disk like saucer with non-flashing green lights about a half mile away.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  I had taken my phone out with me and began taking pictures of this vehicle.  It was odd because it came very close to the path of an airliner.  The green lights were surrounding the perimeter of this UFO. It made no noise.  I counted at least 8 that I could see.  My photos showed how this object didn't just fly horizontal, but was wobbling to vertical at times.  I was able to capture 40 pictures.  The UFO is very hard to see but I have three great ones.  It almost looks like a green beaded necklace.  I am very excited to have seen something that no one can explain.;39.4497;-105.4692
