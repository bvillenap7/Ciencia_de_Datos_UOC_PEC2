On the evening of March 2nd, 2018, at approx. 10:30 pm, I went outside to let the dog do her business.  As I was waiting for her, I got a strange vibe or felt somewhat spooked, which is unusual for me.  For some reason I felt prompted to look up to the east and I saw an orange ball of light moving toward the north.  It came to a standstill and sat for several seconds then suddenly blinked out.  There was a fairly bright moon that evening, which was not quite overhead, but it did not seem to diminish the brightness of these lights. Just a few seconds later 3 orange balls appeared one at a time in a horizontal row just above the trees but somewhat north of the first one.  They became very bright and sat still for perhaps a minute or two.  I called my husband to come take a look but by the time he arrived they had blinked out one at a time.  I could then barely see a less bright orange ball back behind the trees which looked further away, that was moving northeast until it completely disappeared into the trees.  It was hard for me to determine the size or distance, but they were not very high and seemed to have the ability to change from dim orange to bright orange, or totally blink out completely.;38.3714;-105.6868
