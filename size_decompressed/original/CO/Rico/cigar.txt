Ufo sighting backpacking in the San Juans of Colorado.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-21 21:00:00;15 minutes;Ufo sighting backpacking in the San Juans of Colorado At approx 2100 hrs myself and one other experienced guide viewed a cigar shaped craft that we could only estimate as beinf several hundred yards long slowly crossed the valley we were camped in, in the Lizard Head Wilderness area of the San Juan mountains. The craft made no noise and traveled in a slow set course.  There were approx eight white lights on it that blinked every few seconds.  As it was leaving our view inside the valley it seemed to rise higher into the atmospehere until it vanished.  Myself and my friend without talking moved camp into the woodline and we have never talked about this event since.;37.6911;-108.0349
