Triangle seen over Fountain Colorado outside Colorado Springs.;2002-02-07 21:00:00;7 minutes;Triangle seen over Fountain Colorado outside Colorado Springs. I saw this triangle shape object with flicking lights just sitting in the sky not moving up or down just like it was hanging in the shy. I was in a moving car going about 35 miles a hour (on the passager side) and I was looking straight up at it just sitting there in a pitch black sky. I live outside the city limits of Colorado Springs, Colorado. I was stunned to see this out here because I have heard of the flying triangles, but this one was alone. No this was not a commercial airliner, because I see planes all the time from the nearby airport and they are big with hugh flashing lights of differnt colors and moving in a straight line ( and you can hear the engines). I heard no engines or noise from this object just flicking lights.;38.6991;-104.7031
