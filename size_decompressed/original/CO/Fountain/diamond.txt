Craft hovers over neighborhood, then moves sideways and disappears.;2016-01-11 20:20:00;2 minutes;Craft hovers over neighborhood, then moves sideways and disappears. I was driving south on Powers blvd towards Fontaine in Fountain security widefield area.  This area is well known for planes as it has an airport just north of this location as well as an air force base.  Seeing planes of all shapes and sizes come and go is not abnormal and that is why this stood out so much.   As i drove south on Powers I saw what at first appeared to be a plane.  Three bright white lights in a diamond shape and one flashing red on what i would describe as the body of the craft.  The craft heading south banks and starts to head north towards the airport.  Now this is not too unusual for military craft and the slow speed it seemed to be moving at suggested military aircraft.  As I made my way to Fontaine I made a right and headed west on Fontaine.  The craft could be seen out my drivers side window.  As the craft grew closer it seemed to slow down to a point that any normal aircraft would fall out of the sky.  This one however hovered above homes in the area.  There was no sound from the craft and it was not a helicopter based on size and light position on the craft.  Also, there was no reflection from either the white or flashing red light on the craft.  I made a left heading south down Mesa Ridge Pkwy and the craft was completely motionless.  As i passed it on the left i watched it in my rear view mirror.  It moved West behind me.  I turned my car around to follow this strange aircraft.  At the light of Fontaine i made a left and headed west but the lights and craft had disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
