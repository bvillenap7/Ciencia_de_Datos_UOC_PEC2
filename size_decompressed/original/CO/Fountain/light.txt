Glowing Light Above Norad in Colorado Springs;2011-12-24 23:50:00;20 sec;Glowing Light Above Norad in Colorado Springs I ran to the store to pick up some things.  When I pulled up my street on my way home I noticed a glowing light above Norad that I had never noticed before. At first I thought it might be a helicopter or something because it was just hovering there.  I couldn’t make out any kind of shape the whole thing illuminated and had a kind of yellowish orange glow to it.  I only saw it for about 20 seconds and then it took off.  It had a trail of light behind it kind of like when you see a shooting star and then it was gone.  I’m not sure what it was but when I walked in my house I said that either I just saw Santa Clause or a UFO but both sound kind of crazy.  I just hope maybe I can find some answers because it was definitely interesting.;38.6991;-104.7031
