I left my home to retrieve some chewing tobacco from my truck parked in the street in front of my house.  I looked west towards Fort Carson and noticed a very bright light in the sky that I have never seen before.  At first I though it was a helicopter due to its location over an Army installation.  I ruled that notion out due to the lack of blinking lights and the lack of noise.  The craft was perfectly still (didn't weave or bob like a hovering helicopter).   My second thought was that it might be a commercial airplane due to an airport being nearby my location.  But again the lack of lights, noise, and movement ruled that out for me.  In a stroke of luck an airplane happened to be flying at lower altitude in the same direction and provided an outstanding visual reference.  I went back into my house to retrieve my roommate to ensure I wasn't seeing things.  He confirmed that he too saw something strange.  The object to appeared to be in the shape of a cross.  The cro! ss appeared to have been in the shape of two intersecting ovals instead of two linear components.  The horizontal part appeared to have been red in color.  The vertical part was two colors.  The middle was yellow and each end was green in color.  It didn't move for a very long time and our bare feet were getting cold from the concrete path.  We went back in the house for approximately an hour.  When I went back outside for another look, it was gone, like it was never there.  I have served in the military and have seen different aircraft from all over the world and have never seen anything like that.  It compelled me to report it.;38.6991;-104.7031
