((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-05 20:30:00;20 minutes;Saw a straight line of lights at the top of the atmosphere. All the lights were going in a straight line and were perfectly spaced one after the other. Counted at least 75 but there were more because it was already going when we looked up and noticed them. Color seamed to be a light white or orange in color. No blinking lights were observed and were flying above where normal jet airliners would be flying. There was no noise from them,they were perfectly silent. Coming from west to east the best we could tell. All dissapeared at the same spot in the atmosphere. Basically dissapeared.;39.3535;-106.9988
