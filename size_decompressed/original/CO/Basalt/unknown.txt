fast moving, zagging bright lights and hovering at times.;2008-04-23 21:00:00;> 30 minutes;fast moving, zagging bright lights and hovering at times. It was really strange.  I was out with my dog at about 9 pm mst 04/23/08.  The sky was really clear.  I looked over toward the SW because something caught my eye. It was very bright and quite a long distance away.  I could make out red, green and white lights with my bare eyes.  It was moving very fast from side to side.  I ran in the house to get out my binoculars. Then, I could really see it.  I saw one row of horizontal very bright lights.  I went back into the house to tell tell my wife and got another set of glasses for her.  Now it had moved to mid height in the SW sky about mid height in the West.  I could not take my eyes off of it.  I was really excited and my wife was like no big deal but glad to have seen one.  You knew it was not a plane because a plane could not hover like that and make the very radical moves. I watched for about a half hour.  Toward the end a second UFO joined the first one, but quite a distance from the first one. Then, this morning on Channel 7 news they mentioned that UFO's were spotted over Phoenix.  So, someone else saw some too.   The FAA said they had nothing to report.;39.3535;-106.9988
