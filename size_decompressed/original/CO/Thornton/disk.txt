On 06-21-08 at approximately 7:30 PM I was standing on my balcony facing south. I live on the third floor of an apartment complex in Thornton, Colorado.  The sky was partly cloudy and the sun was still shining. I observed the birds and insects flying around the parking lot and the traffic moving along the cross streets to the south and east of my balcony.  I looked directly above me to the sky and observed a silver colored disk approximately 30 feet in diameter hovering above me at about 1,000 feet. This object did not make any sound.  As soon as I seen the object, it took off at a very high rate of speed to the north and flew out of sight in a split second and was gone. I felt that this object somehow knew that I had spotted it and that it had been watching me prior to my seeing it.  I am forever changed from a skeptic to a believer in UFO’s by this sighting.;39.869;-104.9767
A dark circular object with red lights around it constantly rotating.  ((anonymous report));2012-07-14 01:00:00;4 minutes;A dark circular object with red lights around it constantly rotating It was late at night me and my 2 siblings were watching tv and we saw about 6 light flashes, it wasn’t lighting or thunder because there was no clouds and our tv popped and shut down.  Me and my brother ran outside to see what it was and went all around the house while my sister stayed on the porch.  She saw a circular object with red lights around it and called our names.  We ran and saw the object for a couple seconds and then it faded away.  A couple days later our grass was burnt into a perfect circle.

Flying mostly horizontal and a slight bit downward, it has a small white trail behind it and after 1-2 seconds it flashed again and it was gone. The object and the trail as well. As if it were never there. I am pretty sure other drivers on the road with me have to have seen it as well. The biggest thing I noticed was how shiny it was, and it really caught my attention immediately for the few seconds before it disappeared. I did notice a plane flying off in the distance but I live in Denver and see commercial jets and planes as well as military planes pretty often. And this WAS NOT anything like I've ever seen before.;39.869;-104.9767
