Stationary lights in sky for extended period of time that appeared to be an aircraft of some form;2003-09-03 23:45:00;45 minutes plus;Stationary lights in sky for extended period of time that appeared to be an aircraft of some form Observer #1: Former US Army observer and pilot. Observer #2: Housewife Observer #1:  Saw lights in the sky at azimuth of 342 degrees that appeared stationary for a period of 45 minutes. Observer did not stay to watch past that period of time.  The lights appeared to pulsate and change from clear, to red, and green and sometimes all three colors side by side.  At first observer thought that the lights were an airplane from the nearby Denver International Airport.  Then considered atmospheric, planetary, and stars.  Even a helicopter was considered but considering the length of time observed, it was considered unlikely. However, the lights never moved.  As of tonight, 09/04/03, the lights are not in the sky. Observer #2: Saw the same things as Observer #1 and confirms the same sighting.;39.869;-104.9767

Tumbling Star looking UFO above Denver;2009-02-03 16:30:00;5 minutes;Tumbling Star looking UFO above Denver I was looking up at the moon, while the sky was clear and blue, when I saw a light that looked like a star...  This star was drifting toward the south away from the moon.  It almost appeared to be tumbling a little changing colors (white to gray).   Then it just vanished.  Very weird.;39.869;-104.9767

More than 10 lights moving at supersonic speeds, blinking, erratic changes of direction, almost fluid like motion with bursts of speed.;2013-08-12 01:00:00;5+ hours;More than 10 lights moving at supersonic speeds, blinking, erratic changes of direction, almost fluid like motion with bursts of speed. Many (more than 10) lights moving at supersonic speeds, blinking, erratic changes of direction, and rendezvousing with one another sometimes.  You can almost make out light wings on them too, and this is still on going so I'm going to go watch some more.  They also have like a hazy cloud structure they tend to go back to and bounce around in the middle darker areas.;39.869;-104.9767
2 flashing lights seen above Thornton.;2019-12-11 17:50:00;10 Minutes;2 flashing lights seen above Thornton. We were driving north on I-25 between 104th and 120th. I noticed odd blinking lights. There was two of them, blinking at the same time about 2 second intervals. It seemed like they might have been connected because they moved at the same time and at the same speed, however I could not see any shape - I was too far away.  The light was bright white in color. The only illumination that was seen were the two lights.  When they stopped flashing there was no other source of light, no red lights, no green lights - nothing. After watching it for about 5 minutes while driving it simply vanished.;39.869;-104.9767
