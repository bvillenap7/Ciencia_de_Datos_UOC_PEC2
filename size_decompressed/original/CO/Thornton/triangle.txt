See below.;1999-06-03 19:55:00;8 min.;See below. Thursday June 3, 1999 Object observed from approximately 7:55 p.m. to 8:03 p.m., Thornton, Colorado While sitting on the back patio of my home with my wife, I gazed up and something out of the ordinary caught my eye &#8212 something that stood out from the normal air traffic departing DIA (Denver International Airport, 20 miles SE), and much higher. What I discerned shape-wise was extremely wide and triangular and flying northeast to southwest. Squinting my eyes, however, I could not make out a fuselage. This craft was definitely all wing. (Note: I was wearing my prescription glasses, and with them on my vision is corrected to 20/15 &#8212  better than perfect.) The color was either white or gray. For just a few seconds the craft banked (corrected course?) to its left (easterly) and the brightness of the setting sun brightly illuminated its belly during that time. I ran in the house and managed to find my binoculars. I went to the front porch to observe the craft more however, the it was so high and far away by this time that the magnification provided by the binoculars was inconsequential. I then went to my upstairs window, which looks south, and watched until I lost sight of the craft as it headed generally toward Pike's Peak/Colorado Springs (approximately 100 miles away). * At no time were anti-collision lights observed * Craft was perhaps 30,000 - 40,000 feet high * Two contrails tailed behind * Estimate the craft to be as wide or wider than the wingspan of a Boeing 747 * Though unusual, I feel the craft was definitely earthly in origin owing to the conventional way in which it flew * Craft was probably military, but type and purpose clearly unknown by me * Environmental (neighborhood) noise prevented me from hearing the craft I hereby affirm that the above commentary accurately portrays my observations of unidentified craft sighted June 3, 1999 in Thornton, Colorado.

Triangular Shaped Craft with a bright light on each tip;2006-11-04 04:48:00;1.5 Min;Triangular Shaped Craft with a bright light on each tip I was standing outside my house smoking (about 120th & Colorado Blvd) Looking up at the sky and on the far horizon was a craft. At first I thought it was just another airplane but then as it approached I noticed that it's lighting pattern was different. The same exact aircraft over alaska is what I saw. A perfect triangle aircraft with 1 bright light on each tip and a multi color beacon in the middle. The craft was flying below the clouds (low cloud cover because of the cold front so about 5,000 ft) and went from horizon to horizon in about a minute and a half. (From the south to the north parallel to the Rocky Mountains) I got a very good look at the craft and because of the light reflection off the cloud cover I was able to see very good detail. The craft had some kind of Headlight / Spotlight used to see in front of it. The engine was very quiet yet audible (I was in a quiet area) the tone of the engine was unlike any I have heard before.;39.869;-104.9767

There were no cloudes, No way could this have ben  any Christmas lights.. I then saw it move VERY FAST aprox, one mile to the east,then one mile to the west, then stoped for one second then.. shot straight up whithout a streak, a sound, nor was this ANYTHING I nor anybody else could possabely explaine as nothing but a U.F.O.!!!  This is a life changing experance.. and I will be GLAD to take ANY pollygraph tes, or any other test that is avalable to prove My credabilaty or my truth in this matter.

I saw the first UFO around 1:00 am, within the next 30 minutes I saw 4 more and one was being trailed by a low flying triangular shaped;2019-10-06 02:00:00;4 hours;I saw the first UFO around 1:00 am, within the next 30 minutes, I saw 4 more and one was being trailed by a low flying triangular shaped craft with three circles on the bottom and what seemed to be ventilation on the sides of the craft.  There were many orbs and one appeared about 50 feet directly above me and circled slowly.   In the next couple hours I witnessed saucers and opaque masses moving across the sky, one of the low flying masses materialized into an alien looking craft, however I couldn't determine the exact shape,  I'm sure it wasn't a saucer though.  Only two of the saucers had lights and none of them made a sound.;39.869;-104.9767
