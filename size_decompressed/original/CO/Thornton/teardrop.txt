Large  Cone-Tailed Ball of  White Light  crosses Denver Sky;2010-10-15 20:40:00;5 sec.;Large  Cone-Tailed Ball of  White Light  crosses Denver Sky extremely brilliant white sphere-shaped light, that tapered off into a short cone, crossed over the sky of Thornton, Colorado, going from north to south, just over the area of my home at 120th and Colorado Blvd. It seemed to be falling at very slightly curved angle of about 30 degrees. Sky was very clear..was not the moon, which is currently crescent form. Was way too big and tail way too short to be a comet, I thought.;39.869;-104.9767
Giant Teardrop UFO flies down toward Thornton Colorado.;2012-11-18 00:00:00;10 minutes;Giant Teardrop UFO flies down toward Thornton Colorado The object looked like a falling comet but was moving very slow and was white from the bottom to the top.  It was coming down toward the ground in a teardrop shape and was creating its own light.  The tail coming off the object did not move or change form but stayed the same until it reached above the neighborhood.  Was creating the brightest white light ever.  So bright it was like staring at the sun.  Could not have been a plane or balloon as this was so close that i could make out every detail of the object and it was definatly not man made.;39.869;-104.9767
