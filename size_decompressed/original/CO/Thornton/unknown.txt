Thursday March 28th, 2013 approximately 8:15 pm I came inside my home and my wife and I said to one another ‘’do you feel the house shacking?’’ and then we ran outside.  As I ran outside, I looked up and saw a large black object that seemed to have been twice the size of my home, with two red lights on it one on the right front side the other the left rear, it continued to move slowly northeast  I don’t recall seeing a shape I sort of froze and starred in disbelief.  Then my wife said lets fallow it we jumped in the car and tried to fallow it when we got to the street it was gone we circled the block couldn’t find the object so we came home.;39.869;-104.9767

We saw what we believe a flying humanoid , on Pecos & Sherrlwood.  Me and my husband saw it , was flying in a straight line , slowly , no motion.  Then started flying up, disappearing into the sky.  It was about 100 feet off the ground.  All black ....;39.869;-104.9767
Vertical, multi-flashing lights, slow moving to stationary, low to very high altitude and the general shape was a cross/crusifix.;2015-06-03 21:30:00;30+;Vertical, multi-flashing lights, slow moving to stationary, low to very high altitude and the general shape was a cross/crusifix. I was talking to my girlfriend on the telephone outside and looked over to the west.  I saw what appeared to be a plane flying vertically but too slow for a an airplane.  There were numerous lights...red, green, blue and white.  The lights were flashing and vertical.  It was traveling to North...approximately over the foothills (over Broomfield, CO) and continued north toward Ft. Collins.  I looked to the north and saw the SAME light pattern on another object also moving north then east.  I was narrating the events to my girlfriend and she said to take a picture.  I did but the picture doesn't show the shape or colors.  Then, I scanned the sky and saw three more to the northeast very high in the sky.   I have a federal and military background and can estimate the altitude of the lights over Broomfield at around 600-1000 feet above ground level.  The same pattern lights seen to the high northeastern sky had to have been at least 30K feet.  Two of the pattern lights were masked by a thunderstorm cloud moving north.  The top of that cloud could have been 40K in altitude.  Hard to estimate with the lack of light.;39.869;-104.9767
Craft with 4 lights videoed at 4th of July fireworks.;2015-07-04 21:58:00;5 minutes;Craft with 4 lights videoed at 4th of July fireworks. I was watching the firework display at the city rec center, facing west, and just before the finale started, I noticed a few aircraft behind the fireworks display.  One was clearly a plane, and disappeared into the clouds but the other appeared as a group of four lights and was motionless, other than the two lights closest to me which were flashing at a consist (sic.  Constant) rate.  During the finale, the craft moved east toward me, and then hovered to the south of me.  At this point I started taking video on my phone.   After hovering for a couple minutes it drifted south, and then seemed to drop elevation at a rapid rate.  As it reached the house line, it disappeared behind a house and then I caught it briefly between two houses before it was gone.;39.869;-104.9767
Seen by 3: flying object flashed a bright light (not at regular intervals), moved in an erratic path, faster than a plane;2020-07-21 00:00:00;15 minutes;Seen by 3: flying object flashed a bright light (not at regular intervals), moved in an erratic path, faster than a plane We were trying to look for the Neowise comet even though we knew it was too late.  I was showing my husband how to find the Big Dipper, when we saw a bright white light flash above the handle.  We both said, Did you see that? We saw a faint moving light, like a plane, so we kept watching, and it flashed again.  My husband grabbed his binoculars after the first two flashes, trying to see if he could see any red or blue lights to identify it as an airplane.  None, just the one, bright white light.  Our daughter came out and we pointed to where we were tracking it, then she saw it, too.  It didn't have the trajectory of a plane, and the light didn't flash at regular intervals.  From the Big Dipper's handle where we first spotted it, it arced up to the right, then down to the left, then a little hook to the right, then up and arching to the right again, then towards the southeast. And it moved much faster than a plane.;39.869;-104.9767
