My spouse and I noticed a round, very bright white orb hovering high in the sky just northeast of Thornton, CO.  ((anonymous report));2019-09-13 22:16:00;several hours;My spouse and I noticed a round, very bright white orb hovering high in the sky just northeast of Thornton, Colorado.  The object would hover, then move slightly left, move back to its original hovering point, then move slightly right, then back to its original spot, and so on.  It was a very bright white light but occasionally would emit a red light.  This light hovered in the same spot for several hours from approx 10:15pm to 2:00am.  When we looked for it again at 4:00am, it was gone.;39.869;-104.9767
