The object was traveling North to South very slowly.  Looked to be using some kind of stealth technology making the surface look blurry.  It was black with hints of brown and solid.   No noise whatsoever.  No resistance while traveling.  Roughly the size of a very, very large shipping container.  Lost sight of it when it went behind trees.
