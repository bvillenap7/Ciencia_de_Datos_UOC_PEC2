It is very big in comparison to even close neighboring yard lights.  The light is very bright and changes colors from green to amber.  We watched 4 airplanes fly over our heads and surround the light.   The light traveled up and to the right for a few minutes in a bouncing motion.  Then it slowly descended to the other side of the small hill behind our home.  We have anew airport 1 mile from our home and frequently see Army planeso and Blackhawk choppers flying overhead.   The aircrafts that came from the airport surrounded the light and just stayed over it..  They are still there though the light descended out of sight 10 minutes ago.
