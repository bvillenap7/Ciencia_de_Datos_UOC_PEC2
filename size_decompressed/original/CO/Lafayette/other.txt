Event was a meteor shower.  5 meteors spotted in one hour plus 6 regular shooting stars.;1998-12-13 02:00:00;2 hours;Event was a meteor shower.  5 meteors spotted in one hour plus 6 regular shooting stars. My occupation is a secretary.  I was surprised to see the below-described meteor shower (of Dec. 13, 1998) because it was not announced on the news but was more visable for me than the highly-talked about Nov. 16 meteor shower.  In fact, I never saw ANY meteors during the November meteor shower, but I saw 5 on December 13.  It all began at 1:55 am when I woke up from sleep and was laying there looking out the window.  I saw a bright, very large shooting star,  it was about 5 or 6 times larger than a shooting star and way brighter than the brightest star in the sky.  The color was different than the rest of the stars too.  It was the same color as the moon when it is full and bright.  A few seconds later I saw a typical shooting go by just east of the path of the meteor.  A few minutes later I saw a second meteor shooting through the sky and another shooting star a few minutes later.  At this time I phoned the UFO Reporting Center because I thought it was unusual to see 2 meteors and 2 shooting stars in such a short time.  Then I went back to sleep and woke up again at 3:00 am.  I no sooner looked out the window and I saw yet another meteor go shooting by in the sky.  This really got my interest, so I decided to sit up and count how many I saw.  I grabbed a tablet and made a column for shooting stars and one for meteors.  Within an hour (3 am to 4 am) I saw 3 more meteors and 4 more shooting stars for a total of 5 meteors and 6 shooting stars.  I just think it is curious that the public was never told about THIS meteor shower and it was much more spectacular than the one in November that all the news stations covered.  The stars and meteors were all traveling from north/east to south/west. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Sightings correspond to Geminid Meteor Shower.));39.997;-105.0974
First sighting @23:03 while watching meteor shower. Saw VERY large boomerang shape object crossing sky at satellite speed. Again at 0:3;1999-11-16 23:03:00;5 seconds;First sighting @23:03 while watching meteor shower. Saw VERY large boomerang shape object crossing sky at satellite speed. Again at 0:34 with skeptical friend noticing it. It was in the exact line of path as before. Altitude approx. 40k-75k ft. I witnessed this object alone appox. 23:03 while looking for meteorites. Noticed a group of lights, very faint, in the shape of a huge boomerang, possibly a delta shape. It was a perfectly clear night, in a location where light pollution is relativly low. I told my wife and best friend about this sighting, they noticed that I was spooked, but didn't have interest. They accompanied me soon after, only because they wanted to see the meteor shower. My friend @ 0:34 saw the exact same object in the exact same line of path where I witnessed it for a second time. The line of path was North to South. It took approx. 5 sec to cross 70 degrees of sky, and I guess it was approx. 40K to 75K ft. in alt. (guessing 2-3 times an airliners). My background is a B.S. in Aerospace Eng and my profession in Information Systems. The second witness is a Architect and specializes in Museum exhibits.;39.997;-105.0974
Crescent shaped object travels through night sky near Boulder.;2009-02-02 21:34:00;only a few seconds;Crescent shaped object travels through night sky near Boulder. I was driving home from works when I saw an odd shape race across the sky.  I had time to say, Oh my God... fairly calmly before it was gone.  The shape was a bit of a crescent, at an angle to myself and my car.  It was not moving towards me, and not heading at a steep angle towards the ground.  It simply moved across the sky.  There was a brighter light at the front, a dimmer one above and an even dimmer one below the brightest.  They were the color of bright embers and did not flicker or blink.  There was also no tale.  The object seemed large, if I had looked at the end of my thumbnail and held it against the sky with my elbow a bit bent, it would have just covered the object. I'm not certain if this is related or not, but my cell-phone reception has been rubbish ever since even in places it was perfect before.;39.997;-105.0974
Boomerang shaped UFO silently flies across sky in Lafayette Colorado.;2019-11-10 19:35:00;9 seconds;Boomerang shaped UFO silently flies across sky in Lafayette Colorado. A boomerang-like shape slowly flew above us in a straight line. It had sort of gray dots, I assume maybe lights along the craft. They were slightly scattered. From where we were, it looked about three times the size of a plane, in a boomerang shape. We had sighted several planes prior to this, none of which going this direction or of that size. I hadn't seen anything quite like it before. It was silent, though there was wind so that could've blocked any possible noise.It seemed to blend in with the sky as well and it was pretty dark out, but we could still make out the boomerang-like shape. I could see a soft glow around the object. I apologise for not being able to put in the time above. But it was around 7:35 PM when we spotted it.;39.997;-105.0974
