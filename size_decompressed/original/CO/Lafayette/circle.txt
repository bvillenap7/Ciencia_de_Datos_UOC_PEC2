small dark  balloon like object flying straight north to south very quickly in windy conditions.;2003-07-08 18:50:00;~1 minute;small dark  balloon like object flying straight north to south very quickly in windy conditions. the object looked like a balloon that had gone astray at first, but it was going to fast and straight to be one.  it was approximately 300ft in the sky and going north to south very quickly.  the wind had also picked up before this object flew by, which made me think that it couldn't have been a balloon because the wind would have shifted it one way or the other.;39.997;-105.0974
