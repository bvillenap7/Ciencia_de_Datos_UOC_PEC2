16 Lights following each other in a row;2020-12-04 18:15:00;5 Min;16 Lights following each other in a row String of lights, each following each other in formation of a line.  Slowly traveled across sky from south to north horizon.  Some lights traveled closer to one light then back to a well spaced distance from the other light.  Each was about half the light of Venus.  They only were white light in color.  No flashing lights like air planes.  Seemed to hover and float.  No sound.  Took about five minutes to travel from one horizon to the other. I was the only one that witnessed this although I'm sure anyone in my city probably saw it too.  I am a retired computer network engineer.  I witnessed this in front of my residence.;39.997;-105.0974

I noticed a lone brightly blinking star of an unusual/changing shape in the night sky, and got my  binoculars. The star was pulsing sharp bright flashes of red, blue, and green, and multiple colors could be seen at the same time. My roommate witnessed a portion of this phenomenon also. After about 30 minutes it began flashing mostly red. I had put my phone down and turned my back for about 10 seconds to get the phone to take one more video, and when I looked again it was gone.;39.997;-105.0974
