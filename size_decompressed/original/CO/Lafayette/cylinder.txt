I continued trying to look at it but was difficult since I was driving so I pulled over to get a better look and take the video. I saw a pill-shaped cylindrical craft that was silver and shining in the sun. The ends were dark, middle silver, and there was a small box or something hanging off but it's hard to point out what it is. It was moving much like a mylar balloon would, it was rotating in the sky, first doing a vertical flip and then precisely changing to a horizontal flip position and back and forth. I was almost positive it was a mylar balloon until I saw it's abrupt motion in between flips, something moves it, it does not follow the wind and is much to repetitive to be the wind picking something up, it's more methodical than that. I have never been so freaked out in my life. I called my family in tears just saying this is not pos! sible. I called the aviation center and the FAA couldn't tell me much, I'm hoping you can. It was probably around 400-500ft in the sky when I spotted it and would go up and down roughly 1000-2000 ft or so. You can see a plane fly over in the beginning of the video and it does a good job of being able to tell how far out the craft was. It was much lower than a plane but much higher than a drone. The video does such a better job at explaining it. I really can't believe I caught the video I did, I sent it to the FAA like I said, and they said they had several people look at it and they were unable to determine what it was. Any help would be so appreciated. I feel like I just discovered something and no one cares!;39.997;-105.0974
