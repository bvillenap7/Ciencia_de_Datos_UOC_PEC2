I was staying at a hotel near I-25 and Circle Dr.  This hotel had patios and balconies for smokers or people who just wanted to sit outside.  The room I stayed in was on the first floor, near the tennis/basketball courts.   Anyway, I had just gotten back from having dinner with a friend of mine and I was starting to wind down for the night.  The drive down there from Denver was horrible because we encountered major storms earlier in the day.  Lots of heavy rains and hail from Denver to the Sprgs.  So I decided to go out on the patio and have a smoke or two before I went to bed. I was out there for about 5 or 10 mins, when I suddenly saw a white translucent chevron aircraft flying silently to the South/Southwest.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  I have never seen one of these objects before.  It was flying around 2000-3000 ft. up in the air and it was moving very fast.  Unfortunately, there was a large tree close to where I was standing and the object flew behind the tree and I didn't see it again. As soon as I noticed it was gone for good, I noticed several perfect circles (a bit larger than basketballs) that were also white and translucent that were much lower in the sky, and they were much closer to me and my position!  At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I started to rub them.  But as soon as I stopped rubbing them, I saw more of the white circles just hovering in the air. There were people playing tennis that night and there were other people on one of the other courts because I could hear them being really loud and laughing about something, but I didn't know what.  I didn't get the impression that any of them saw what I just saw, but I don't know for sure.  I did not sleep well that night at all and I kept getting the impression that something was watching me.  It was so creepy!  I have had numerous UFO sightings over the past 21 years, but I've never seen anything like these objects.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
