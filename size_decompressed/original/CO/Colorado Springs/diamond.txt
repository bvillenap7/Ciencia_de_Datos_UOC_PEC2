Per usual I was looking up at the sky when I saw a large object seemingly hovering around in the same spot.  There was a weird light zipping around the object that I was able to get on video. When looking up at the sky there was an object that seemed quite large hovering in a small area. There were several lights around the bottom of the object which is how I was able to see it slightly moving in sort of a circle.  I assumed, at first, that it was a plane, but as I stood there it didn't seem to be really going anywhere.  It seemed to be very high up above the clouds, though it still seemed quite large. I decided to try to film what was going on with my phone. It couldn't quite pick up the large object even zoomed in as far as it would go.  It did, though, pick up a strange white light that seemed to just be zipping around the sky around the larger object.  This object moved very quickly in a random pattern back and forth around the larger object.  It seemed to almost disappear for a super brief period and then it would reappear on the other side of the larger object in the blink of an eye. As I said, I did get it on video and have watched it several times and even had my husband and sister watch it and we cannot figure out what could be moving around in such a way.  I don't want to just jump to UFO, but I cannot come up with any other explanation. If there was something that was going on at this time of morning in the sky I haven't been able to find it when googling for possible answers.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
