9 unknown lights off interstate heading towards colorado springs. 6 unknown lights over the mountains with planes and watching;2000-06-20 22:00:00;over 30 minutes;9 unknown lights off interstate heading towards colorado springs. 6 unknown lights over the mountains with planes and watching we were having bad lightning at night. we were coming home from visiting family. we saw a set of 3 lights. they were not moving or blinking like normal planes. then other sets would apear out of nowhere. they would appear after lightning. we were driving south on the interstate towards colorado springs. at the most there were probablly 9 lights total. there were cars parked along both sides of the road, so i could not tell you how many people saw it.they then started to line up, kind of like being in a 45 degree angle. they then disappeared. we never pulled over, we were driving the whole time. i then thought i saw something on the ground, and there were jeeps driving around it. i started to park and try to walk to where it was, but it was like you could see it clear from the interstate however it was a good 2 miles from the interstate(if that makes any sense). well we drove for a while and i decided to turn around and try to find some sort of road to see where it was because i kind of knew where it was. well i could not find it so we started to head for home. then over the mountains a set of 3 lights just was there.then another set of 3 came over the mountains. well we decided to pull over on the interstate to watch. there were other cars but i dont know how many people. then littler lights would come from the bigger lights and go to the opposite 3 sets of lights. the lights would come and go, but there would always be 3 there. it was like they were rotating and spinning and not always were they in a triangular shape. well we decided to go to a scenic off ramp because not ever car was stopping and the speed limit on colorado interstate is 75. i was getting nervious that someone would hit us because colorado drivers are not always the best decision makers. anyhow we get to a scenic ramp. i get out of my car and look up. there were all sorts of planes and i think helicopters flying around. i mean a lot, so i took that as a sign that these lights were not ours. we watched them until we got bored because ! they wer e at the mountains, never did they come closer than that. we got back on the interstate and watched the lights until we got into colorado springs. all the street lights and other lights blocked what we had been seeing. we went home. there were still many planes flying around when we got home for the night. even the next day there were more than normal amounts of planes flying around low and high. the only reason i though you would like to know is because there were so many car pulled over watching so im curious to see if any one else has reported it.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
This one is no obect- it moves about and doesn't seem to ever need any sleep though.;2006-04-24 04:30:00;while I am in here;This one is no obect- it moves about and doesn't seem to ever need any sleep though. This one Extra-terrestrial has been an annoyance now for over a week.  I'm sure it's a male though.  It's not very friendly but at least it's better than the other one.  It seems to need to try and make that it's a human being!  He doesn't have me convinced.  That room is supposed to be vacant and he's making noises and was it seems constanly dropping those.  A few weeks ago I heard some craft fly over making that old harmonica melody I used to play when on board.  They must have left it off to annoy me when in here is where I stay.  Is there any number to UFO police in this website?  I checked the 2nd box from the botton in the list of characteristics because it's closest but should be : there was an aircraft in the vicinity that seemed extraterrestrial but left and that is why I am reasonably sure that they left him someplace above.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
What apeared to be a white dot in a clear blue sky, was acually a sagnificant size unknown aircraft reflecting the sun;2008-11-19 13:25:00;10-15seconds;What apeared to be a white dot in a clear blue sky, was acually a sagnificant size unknown aircraft reflecting the sun I happened to be looking west over the mountains and noticed there was an aircraft traveling south with the normal exhaust trail coming from behind the plane.  Then what looked like a white dot:  appeared about 100 meters from behind the plane moving west.  This unknown aircraft was moving at a pretty good rate of speed and had no exhaust trail of any kind.  Watching this unknown aircraft as it moved I realized that what appeared to be a white object, was the reflection from the sun, and had to be a significant size to give off that amount of glare.  This unknown aircraft continued to travel west as it disappeared for few seconds a couple of times.    Than returned in the same flight path heading west.  There were no clouds in the sky or area that would obscure my sight.  I watched this unknown aircraft for a good ten to fifteen seconds before it completely disappeared 50 meters or more before the ridge line.  Four or five seconds after the unknown aircraft disappeared. There was a small exhaust trail 50 meters to the south of where the unknown aircraft was last seen coming over the ridge line traveling east.  The unknown aircraft did not appear again.

Large disk shaped object above Mtn Shadow..Glowing red-blue-green-white.&is stationery..;2012-09-02 00:00:00;15-20 minutes;Large disk shaped object above Mtn Shadow..Glowing red-blue-green-white.&is stationery.. My boyfriend and I noticed an odd large very bright light north of Pikes Peak mountain..At that time, there was a tradgic fire in the NorthWest area of Colorado Springs..  We thought maybe it was a air craft aiding the burn area..However, the fire was almost 99% contained..  As well as, this large light appeared to be changing colors..in a pattern..It went from red to blue to green to white..It continued turning these colors..  We got out some binoculars, to check it out.. We were on the Northeast side of Colorado Springs(bout 10-15miles away)  Once we got it into a more clearer focus, we could see that it seemed to have a disk- like shape..  Two of my boyfriends neighbors approached us with the same curiosity of this glowing object..  They too, had been watching this odd light..which was stationary the whole time we were watching it!! After bout 15mins or so of observing it, we started to walk back to my boyfriends house.  Then, my boyfriend&I saw this red star-like! light in front of us, a few hundred feet in the air , appear out of nowhere!!  It traveled (quickly)up at a 90 degree angle, then moved erractically.and then disappeared!! 20 mins later we were leaving his house..and saw the strange light above the mountain range was gone!! Needless to say, in the passed 3months or so, I've encountered about 8 or more different bizarre&unexplainable sightings in the night sky!!! In a sense,all this slightly worries me because several of my friends have also had encounters frequently as well..!! In this case, the &quotunknown,&quot makes me a lil vexed!!! :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
UFO Lands in Colorado Spings! People were out and about! Nobody noticed!;2013-04-14 21:35:00;90 seconds;UFO Lands in Colorado Spings!  People were out and about!  Nobody noticed! I was walking south on 19th street from Uintah, I got less than a block from Boulder Ave, looked up and to the right and saw it.  At vaguely 60-65 degrees, I saw a strange craft of only a vaguely discernable shape. It was either an egg shape, or a fat disk, the size of an F-150 truck.   The rectangular shaped light panels were so bright and tonights overcast haze conspired to obscure it.  The objects &quotfrom west- to south&quot trajectory put  its position from my point of view to be roughly a mile and a half from 19th and Boulder Ave. I would suppose that it was hovering over the areas between 21st and 18th from west to east, and pikes peak avenue and the Highway 24 corridor from north to south.  I would guess that it was about 100- 150 ft. In altitude, slower than a plane, but faster than a chopper.  The object did not continue its west to east flight, it came down!  It was no helicopter!  It did not have the characteristic waver of a pitch change from forwa! rd to down, as it did this very quickly.  Thats it.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

It traveled in a straight line and move through the entire frame fro upper right to lower left within the 3 second time period of the three photos. f3.5 iso800 Nikon d5100 was used in low resolution.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Red and green lights over Olympic Training Center.;2014-11-29 03:30:00;3 minutes;Red and Green lights over Olympic Training Center. Leaving from work early Saturday morning around 3:30 A.M. I noticed red and green lights off in the distance over the Olympic Training Center.  It stood out to me because I had never noticed the lights before.  As I continued driving I saw it was hovering over the OTC.   When I stopped driving it quickly shot out to the North.  It had no sound and I could not see any shape to it.  I watched it move off into the distance as far as I could see, it until it disappeared.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

Green flashes seen above Colorado Springs.;2016-07-04 21:12:00;1 hour;Green flashes seen above Colorado Springs. Starting at roughly 21:12, July 4, 2016, I (and others near me, as we were gathered watching a fireworks show) witnessed what seemed to be an oblong craft silently drifting through the clouds above the park that the public and I were in.  It appeared fairly large and at high elevation, as it could be seen fairly well from within the clouds.  For minutes at a time, the craft emitted repetitive green flashes from its underbelly.  On rare occasion, it emitted much more rapid white flashes for significantly shorter periods.  The craft seemed to have a stainless steel-like metallic sheen.  It darted across the sky rapidly and silently.  The maneuvers the craft performed were erratic and unpredictable, yet it hovered primarily above the aforementioned park and almost seemed to watch the fireworks (or the people’s reaction to which).  It then disappeared and did not show up again.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Four HUGE Lights Hovering Over Colorado Springs, CO Caught on Video;2016-10-20 20:30:00;5 minutes;Four HUGE Lights Hovering Over Colorado Springs, CO Caught on Video At approximately 8:30 pm (20:30) on October 20th, 2016, my girlfriend and I were heading North on a back road we commonly go down when I noticed a bright light in the center of my rear view mirror.  I commented on it and my girlfriend said that it was probably just a plane as we live near an air force academy.  I agreed but kept watching as a second bright light appeared next to it, then a third and the final fourth light.  I immediately did a U-turn so we can get a better look and watched for about five minutes while driving towards it. It should be noted at this point that the lights were off in the distance directly over the city lights.  My girlfriend started recording the lights with her phone and one by one the lights started disappearing as if they were never there until the last one faded out. I uploaded the video of the lights to YouTube where I explain in text everything I have outlined here and explain that we know a plane or aircraft when we see one and this is definitely not just a plane.  I should also add that each light went out about twenty seconds after the previous one.  I don't know if this is frowned upon but the link to the video is provided below.  Thanks.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASaCVyhrSSc;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

w/ a 15 mm lens.  I saw a thing orbit the moon and emit something at the moon. It hit the moon. ((anonymous report));2017-08-16 20:13:00;1 minute;I was looking at the moon with a 15 millimeter lens.  I saw a thing orbit the moon and emit something at the moon.  It hit the moon. There was this thing that flew around the moon a few times very fast, and then shoot something at the moon.  It left a small crater.   I zoomed in on it with a 9 millimeter lens.  The impact had some debris fly away when it hit.  The debris had a pattern on it.  The crater glowed for about 5 seconds.  That was the last of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

Noticed an object hovering silently high above just northeast of Peterson AFB.  Too far to identify shape.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-25 14:50:00;5 minutes;Noticed an object hovering silently high above just northeast of Peterson AFB.  Too far to identify shape or details.   At first I thought perhaps it was a white plastic bag that may have been swept up high or a balloon.  Then it occurred to me that if it were, at that height, it wouldn’t be visible.   After about a minute or two of hovering it started to move southwest towards Cheyenne mountain.  It was below the high clouds and the sky way mostly clear and sunny.  The white object then appeared black as it continued its trek SW.  There was no sound, no contrails, and no other aircraft. I filmed a few seconds of it with my iPhone.
