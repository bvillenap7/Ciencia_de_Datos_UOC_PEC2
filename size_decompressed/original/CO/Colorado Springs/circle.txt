I have told this story for over the years and never knew who to go to until tonight after watching the Peter Jennings broadcast. My friend ((name deleted)) and I witnessed a UFO sighting in Colorado Springs, CO around noon in the summer of 1974.  His family lived a couple of houses down from mine on Northcrest Drive located on the bluffs near the foot of Pikes Peak. I remember it was a crystal clear day without a cloud in the sky.  We were lying on our backs in ((name deleted)) front yard talking about things that eleven and twelve year old boys chat about and then he said to me look up into the sky.  I looked up but didnâ€™t see anything.  Then he pointed up with his left arm and I followed his line of sight and saw eight round disks rotating in a circular motion directly above us.  We pondered what they could be and I specifically remember asking him if he thought they were angels.  We watched these objects rotate in an extremely tight motion above us for many minutes. There were a couple of unusual things that immediately caught my attention.  The first was that the eight objects were metallic (silver/whitish) in appearance, circular in shape and were flying and rotating in an extremely tight circular pattern.  We viewed the objects from underneath and I remember the movement seemed extremely unusual since we were used to seeing military aircraft since we lived so close to the Air Force Academy.  Besides both of our fathers worked for a government subcontractor who worked for NORAD and so we were very familiar with all types of military aircraft of that era.  What was most shocking is what happened next.  As I stated the eight objects were rotating in a circular motion and then they suddenly stopped moving.  The objects remained motionless without falling from the sky and all were perfectly separated from one another.  Then they suddenly accelerated at an astonishing speed from one another in exactly opposite directions.   I followed one of the objects as it flew over Pikes Peak and when it disappeared behind the mountain I looked back to where the rest were, they were all gone.  My Friend ((name deleted)) followed another one of the objects in different direction and was also amazed.  After witnessing the finally, only then did it occur to us that we did not see angels.  I swear to God that what I witnessed is true and will continue to believe it until the day I die.  Some facts: Colorado Springs is about 5,000-6,000 feet above sea level.  Pikes Peak is about 14,100 feet above sea level.  The objects we witnessed must have been at least 8,000 - 9,000 feet above us since one of them cleared Pikes Peak ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

In my opinion, I witnessed a metor fall from the sky and impact the ground west of Colorado Springs.;2002-11-28 18:23:00;1 minute;In my opinion, I witnessed a metor fall from the sky and impact the ground west of Colorado Springs. Coming home from a Thanksgiving meal shared with friends, I was headed west from Colorado Springs toward the mountains. At the intersection of Cenntennial and Allegeny, I witnessed a neon green circle followed by an orange fire trail dropping straight down from the sky at my 11 o'clock. Upon impact in the foothills, the mountain lit up briefly with a flash of green light.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Round object that glowed within it.;2003-01-17 05:10:00;10 seconds;Round object that glowed within it. I had left my house about 5:10a.m. , walking west to my car,  something caught my eye.  I glanced up and saw a completely round object in the sky going west toward Norad/Cheyenne Mountain Air Station.  It glowed within, however, no light emerged from it.  It was moving rather fast, it was not that far up in the sky.  I stood there in complete awe for a couple of seconds.  It then completely disappeared.  No one believes me.  When I saw your article in the Gazette, I felt I had to report it.  My son just informed me he believes me!!!  One more thing, the object made no sound.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Bright white ball flew from west to east, did strange manuevers over and around Polaris.;2005-02-03 22:30:00;20 minutes;Bright white ball flew from west to east, did strange manuevers over and around Polaris. The craft was round and white--not like an airplane at all. I looked out my back window and noticed something flying high, because there was a few jets flying by--making lots of noise...weird time to be flying jets! When i looked out the window, it slowly went from west to south east, and it appeared to be far away. I went outside a few minutes later to see it better, and because it had dissapeared from my window view. It was fairly nice outside, only misty-looking clouds in the north west. It went slightly past (I think) Polaris, to the left, then made a manuever to the right, which seemed too unreal for a plane to do.... It seemed to hover in the south east sky for about five minutes--and for thirty seconds or so, seemed to be coming toward my direction, then went back again. Then, after going around in a weird centricity, it seemed to still, right in front of what I believe to be Polaris. It did the strangest thing: it appeared to fly at the same rate as Polaris(?) was moving across the sky. I went in becauseit was cold for gloves, and when I came back, Polaris(?) was less intense--it was alone now.... Anyway,It was like a glowing ball of light. I watched for another hour outside on and off and even brought out a map of the sky for positioning. But the map I have is for January--don't know if that was Polaris! I'm not into astronomy or aliens except to read sci-fi! I watched two airplanes cross the southeast sky afterward. Gave me a good idea of how close it was: not as close as an airplane--that's for sure! It never seemed to blink, too not like the stars or airplane lights.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Golden orb seen over Colorado Springs;2005-07-04 20:00:00;1 minute;Golden orb seen over Colorado Springs Sighting in Colorado Springs, July 4, 2005 at 8 pm  I was at my friend Gail's house in the Springs. We were sitting on her deck after a BBQ when she looked up at the cloud pattern toward the East and said, Oh, there's a ship up there, I feel it. She is a practicing psychic with years of good experience so I pay attention when she feels something. I looked where she was pointing and saw nothing. While we were both looking in the area suddenly a bright illuminated golden spot (small circle) manifested there and traveled from East to West at a constant speed. It never changed its course, speed or brightness and went across the sky in about one minute while we watched it. We have a lot of military in the area, Ft Carson, NORAD, Schreiver Air Base, Space Command and we see aircraft all the time. This was not a plane or a chopper. Even though it was the fourth of July, it was not any kind of fireworks I had ever seen. While we thought at first it might have been a mylar balloon, it traveled in the opposite direction to the prevailing wind with no bobbing or wobble we could discern, more like a determined path than one subject to the wind. We have no other explanation than it was a ship, like she intuited.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Circular Bright White Flying Saucer.;2006-04-04 02:30:00;1 hour;Circular Bright White Flying Saucer I saw a circular flying saucer just last week. I didn't find this site until now to report it. The saucer was bright white and it impossibly flew really fast in circles, which aircrafts couldn't normally do. It was too far away to notice the details on the saucer, but I can tell it wasn't an airplane. It flew over the airport in Colorado Springs. Couldn't the people at the airport have detected the saucer? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

Interesting lights and movement near the US Air Force Academy;2012-06-10 00:00:00;5 minutes;Interesting lights and movement near the US Air Force Academy My roommate and I were outside smoking a cigarette when we noticed two redish orange objects hovering over what looked to be near the US Air Force Academy.  Thinking they were just stars, we somewhat ignored them.  Looking back a moment later, we noticed they had moved.  We called my boyfriend out to watch with us.  At this time, we all discussed what we thought they might be. (Both my roommate and boyfriend are or have been in the military recently).  We ruled out the possibility of helicopters due to how perfectly still they sat, and for how long.  The colors of them should not have been visible at night from the distance we were at as well.  Watching for a few more minutes, we noticed a third object of the same size and color moving down to the other two.  They appeared to be flashing different colors at the same time, but were mainly the redish orange.  One object appeared to have been spraying a liquid (looked like water, but sparkled.  Roommate describes it as plasma).  Then, the objects came to form a perfect triangle.  We unfortunately went inside for a brief few minutes. Upon returning outside, the objects were gone and have not returned since. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date shown is approximate.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Colorado Springs sighting of multiple UFO's.;2013-04-01 17:00:00;30 minutes;Colorado Springs sighting of multiple UFO's I was sitting on my porch in Fountain looking east towards Peterson AFB area.  As I'm staring at the clouds, I make out several white, circle-shaped UFO's flying among the clouds.  They didn't appear to be in a formation.  Some were in groups and some were flying solo.  They flew from the direction of the base and proceeded to fly southeast.  I sat there for about 30 minutes, all the while, staring at the clouds.   I then noticed that they came back from the southeast and back towards the base.  I didn't see them land.   They disappeared into the clouds.

Bright orange object moving across sky;2014-12-27 19:00:00;2 minutes;Bright orange object moving across sky I went outside with my dog around 7 pm.  I was facing west. I saw a bright orange light moving across the sky.  It looked like it had spikes of light coming out at the top, bottom and both sides.   I called for my son and asked him, What is that? He replied, I don't know, but it's below the clouds.  My vision is a little fuzzy at night, so I asked him to get my glasses.  He grabbed them and ran back out with them.  The spikes coming off it weren't as pronounced when I saw it more clearly, but they were still there.  My son thought it looked like it was on fire.   It proceeded to the north and after a couple minutes just faded and disappeared.  There was no sound, and it wasn't moving very fast.   I googled bright orange ufo over Colorado Springs, and there were several images that came up.  Several of them looked exactly like what my son and I saw.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

Very fast object. I was standing outside on my last break at work staring at the stars.  There were about 15 satellites that I saw flying overhead before the signing.  This object seemed to appear out of nowhere as an incredibly fast moving light in the cloud, making very sporadic movements and making no sound.   It flew directly overhead and underneath a cloud that was reflecting the city lights.  That is when I could see the round nature of this object.  It slowed down when it was directly above, and then it continued on its way before completely disappearing.   This was absolutely insane.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

Two craft traveling similar path stop completely and fade from sight, one after another.;2020-09-04 21:00:00;4 minutes;Two craft traveling similar path stop completely and fade from sight, one after another. Date: 09/04/20 Time: 9-9:15 pm., GMT Location: Colorado Springs, Colorado  Description  On the date and time listed above,  I was located in my back yard observing the planets Jupiter and Saturn, facing in a southeastern direction.  I was not using any equipment or devices to aid my observation.  The sky appeared free of any interference such as clouds, dust, or smoke.  I was not under the influence of any legal or otherwise substance or liquid. As I continued to observe the location given above, I briefly averted my eyes away from the sky and when my eyes returned to the area of Jupiter and Saturn, I observed a white dot moving quickly along a path slightly east of a midway line between Jupiter and Saturn, moving in a straight line from SSE to NNW.  At first I thought it might be the ISS, but realized it was moving too slow to be the ISS, having seen the ISS on several previous occasions.  The size and brightness of the white dot was comparable to that of the ISS.  I did not observe any flashing lights such as one might see when observing a high altitude airliner. After realizing that the white dot was moving too slow to be the ISS, I continued watching the white dot until it reached a point NNW of Jupiter/ Saturn, at which time the dot stopped moving.  It remained motionless but began to fade or diminish until it was no longer visible.  I continued observing the location where the dot was last seen to see if it would reappear, but it did not. After approximately 60 to 90 seconds, my attention was drawn to a moving white dot, identical to the first, in an area of the sky to the east of Saturn,  traveling in a SE to NW direction, from south of a straight line from Saturn to Jupiter to a location NW of Saturn/Jupiter, but still east of the line of the first white dot.  The description of this dot is identical to the first in size, brilliance, and color. After achieving a point NW of Jupiter/Saturn, this dot also stopped and as I watched it also began to fade until it was no longer visible.  I continued to observe the area of the last visible location of both dots to see if they reappeared, for a period of time of about ten minutes.  I returned to my back yard several times over the next half hour but failed to observe any appearance of these two white dots.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
