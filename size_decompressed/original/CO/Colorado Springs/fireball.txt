The fireball broke;1998-01-11 00:10:00;15 seconds;A friend and I witnessed a pulsating, intensely bright, fireball near I-25 between Colorado Springs and Castle Rock. The fireball broke apart into three, flaming-orange chunks northeast of our position on I-25. A friend and I were returning from Denver to Colorado Springs after attending the Colorado Avalanche vs. Ottawa Senators game. We were driving on I-25, headed South. The night was relatively clear and brisk. The temperature was about 20 deg F and there was fairly extensive snow cover along the interstate. I also believe the moon was prominent on this night because it was unusually light outside for the hour. My friend and I were talking and listening to the radio when, all of a sudden, all hell broke loose. The ENTIRE sky, from the Front Range to the eastern horizon, erupted with a pulsating, incredibly bright, white light.  Due to the steep angle at which the object approached us, its speed, and it's approximately S-SW to N-NE flight path (which roughly paralleled our path on I-25), we were unable to observe it directly. In other words, the roof of our vehicle was in the way of our view. However, as the object travelled NE and neared the ground, it came into view out the drivers side window. We then observed the object break apart into 3, flaming-orange chunks to our NE just beyond a series of bluffs (about 5 miles away I would guess), at which point it disappeared. We heard no sound during this event, probably because of engine/road noise and because the car stereo was on. I hate to say this, but my absolute, first thought when I saw the pulsing light was that we were being abducted or attacked by a UFO. My second thought was that there was no way it was lightening (too cold, wrong time of year, clear skies, no storms around, etc, etc.). My third thought was someone get this damned roof out of my way so I can see what the hell is going on!. And then, I finally realized that it must have been a meteorite which broke apart into at least 3 large pieces. Needless to say, this event was all my friend and I talked about the rest of the way back to Colorado Springs. Once we got to town, we started hearing radio reports regarding what we had witnessed. Apparently, it was a meteorite, complete with sonic bo! om heard all along the Front Range. Regardless of what it was, I will never forget that night and feel privileged to have witnessed (indeed, survived) it from such close proximity.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
A slowly descending Blue-Green Fireball.  First Appeared at apx. 52 deg. El. and went down to apx. 0 deg.  Disappeared behind Condo's. ;1998-02-26 20:30:00;30-40 sec;A slowly descending Blue-Green Fireball.  First Appeared at apx. 52 deg. El. and went down to apx. 0 deg.  Disappeared behind Condo's. Had contrail of the same color.  Drifting slightly southward from a compass heading of apx. 305. deg. This is the young women you played the tape of on the Art Bell show. Age 41.  She was sitting on the couch with her husband watching TV.  He refused to turn around and look at it.  They estimate 30-40 sec. vice. 3-4 minutes she said when she was excited. I've found a second eye witness, I hope to talk to Tuesday night.  Maybe I can then triangulate and get a better idea of how far away it was. Because of the distance to the Condo's that it disappeared behind it could have been anywhere from 500 ft. to 5 miles away.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

Fireball appearing and disappearing in daylight sky over Colorado Springs;2009-09-10 17:00:00;Approx. 1 minute;Fireball appearing and disappearing in daylight sky over Colorado Springs This report is from my sighting of two years back (sometime in 2009-10), however, given the increase of the appearances of this type of UFO stated by Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast am, I feel I should contribute my sighting. This sighting took place over my neighborhood in Colorado Springs.  I was parked near my home to finish listening to the last part of a Coast to Coast show.  This show had nothing to do with UFOs by the way, so UFOs were not on my mind.  I reclined my driver's seat to gaze up at the sky while listening.   Suddenly a red/orange translucent sphere appeared in the sky.  It moved slowly for maybe 1 quarter mile (in my estimation) in a north-easterly direction before slowly disappearing back into the blue.  It was day light outside with no stars showing, nor were there any clouds near this object. However, there was a nearby plane (civilian Leer jet type of plane).  I have no idea if the pilot noticed the orange sphere.  This plane was useful only in that it gave me an indication of the altitude, whatever that typically is for Leer Jets.

Fast moving yellow/green glowing fire ball with comet trail in Colorado Springs, lands at Air Force Academy.;2012-12-07 00:45:00;5 seconds;&gt* Fast moving yellow/green glowing fire ball with comet trail in Colorado Springs, &quotlands&quot at Air Force Academy Approx 12:45am Friday, December 07, 2012 My daughter and I were driving northbound on the 1-25 Freeway last night at about 12:45am.  Right as we reached the Woodmen exit I saw something out of the corner of my eye that attracted my attention.  My daughter was driving so i was able to stare at this until it disappeared.  Up and to the left of our car I saw a very fast moving bright green/yellow ball of light that had a green trail like a commit.  I’ve seen falling stars before and it looked a lot like that in that it got bigger and brighter until it disappeared only it was bright green and it wasn’t way up in the sky. It was very low.  I know this wasn’t an optical illusion because I could see the outline of the mountain and it was definitely below the mountain line, in front of the mountain, and was parallel to the freeway at that point. I immediately stared at it as it passed our car like we were standing still.  (we were traveling at about 75mph at the time).  It came down at about a 30° angle then it disappe! ared out of my view.  It looked to me like it would have been pretty much right above Falcon Stadium at the Air Force Academy when it disappeared.  At that point I can’t tell if it landed or it actually disappeared... it was low enough at that point that it was behind trees & buildings and I just couldn’t see it anymore.  This thing was completely silent.   I’ll tell ya what, it freaked me out.  I’ve never seen anything like that before. I tried my best to recreate what I saw with a paintshop program.  Keep in mind this is a daytime google image I’m trying to make look like midnight, but the overall effect is very close to what I saw.

2-6 floating, with upword movement, yellow-orange lights outside the USAFA in Colorado Springs;2017-03-20 22:19:00;3 minutes;2-6 floating, with upword movement, yellow-orange lights outside the USAFA in Colorado Springs The light objects varied from 2-6 (i.e. some would disappear/reappear, maybe like a flare).  The color was orange/yellow.  There was movement, which included upward movement.  The location was East of I25 possibly between North Gate Rd & Interquest (re: just outside the USAFA).   I reported to the USAFA. and stated I would guess it was amateur drones and told them I have video footage.  However, they have not requested the video footage from me.  It appeared there was a triangular pattern, but the lights disappearing/reappearing could be movement on an axis.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
