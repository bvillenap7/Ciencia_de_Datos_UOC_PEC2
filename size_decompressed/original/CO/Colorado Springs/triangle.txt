Triangular black craft in broad daylight hovering high and then speeding off.;1981-01-15 10:00:00;10;Triangular black craft in broad daylight hovering high and then speeding off. This sighting has stuck clearly in my memory for 20+ years although I only occasionally thought about it over the years as you hear about UFOs.  It was a sight where you instantly know this is something extraordinary and not what our brains are used to processing and seeing.  I never really investigated anything more about it over the years because the craft I saw was triangular and I never heard of anyone seeing such a thing.  Until yesterday.  I watched a cable special about the UFO incident in 2000 near St. Louis with the various officer sightings of a black triangular object.  I then checked the internet to see about sightings in Colorado at roughly the same time of mine.  I have goose bumps again to see so many similar sightings from seemingly credible accounts.  My story is brief but it left a permanent record on my mind.  I can't remember the exact date but it was in the early 1980s and I was a passenger in a car with my brother driving.  We were on a small street road near our house and it was daylight and very clear.  As we were driving, I casually glanced at Pikes Peak which occupies a large part of the mountainous view in Colorado Springs.  Near the top (above treeline) and slightly to the right of Pikes Peak was a triangular black object that appeared to be rotating.  It was close to Pikes Peak and probably 5 miles from me - line of sight.  I could tell it was very large given its relative dimension to Pikes Peak just behind it.  Had this been at night I could have dismissed it as any possible craft but being a clear day I was instantly startled as to what this was.  I had a good familiarity with military aircraft with my father in the Air Force and growing up in Colorado Springs near the Air Force Academy.  As I stated, the fact that it was triangular and didn't seem to have any other discernable shape or markings, I was amazed at what this might be.  I immediately told my brother to look and even told him stop the car and look.  By the time he finished asking what is it and stopped the car, I watched it disappear at an incredible speed over and behind Pikes Peak.  I never saw it or anything like it again but after reading these accounts I felt I had to add my story to the many accounts listed.  I am shocked to see many accounts even older than mine of similar sightings which indicates it could not have been any kind of experimental military craft.  I hope one day I can find out what it was and solve the mystery. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Clear night, calm winds, object triangular, blue glow emanating all around, flying at250 to 500 feet north to south direction no noise ;1991-11-15 01:00:00;5 min;Clear night, calm winds, object triangular, blue glow emanating all around, flying at250 to 500 feet north to south direction no noise or sound At 100 am while watching tv,, a voice came over the tv interfering with the reception said Look Out! in a strong comanding voice. To my amazement I did after thinking about it for several nights I decided to investigate ....At about the same time a week or so later....While looking out the window, with binoculars in hand, I chose a good background of stars to pass the time when suddenly an object came into view...to my amazement this object floated carelessly toward me. At first I didnt know what to think and I started to get nervous,..... as I waited my heart began to race in anticipation to what this could be. As it drew closer I knew that this was something not of this earth ,because of the strange glow it had and how perfectly its color matched the stars, triangular in shape bigger than a C-5 military cargo plane and no sound.. It was very inconspicuous and frightening to say the least because of the way it so effortlessly moved, ever so slowy through the sky..as if to say to the observer here i am and there is nothing you can do to stop me! thats when I dropped the binoculars and looked at it as it passed over head ...Immediately i focused on the door knob to see if this thing was coming to get me as i could no longer see it overhead.....I immediatly woke my wife and called my brother who was at home but works at NORAD as a sergent in the airforce..further more I am an aircraft mechanic, FAA certified...and I know it was not ours ...Nor was it a STEALTH aircraft but i must say now i know where we got part of this technology.....more sightings to be continued .......;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

Triangular light formation in Colorado.;1997-03-14 22:30:00;10 seconds;Triangular light formation in Colorado. I recently watched a documentary (UFOs Seeing is Believing) hosted by Peter Jennings on the National Geographic Channel, which prompted me to report after all this time, something I saw when living in Colorado Springs over 10 years ago. The particular discussion on the type of objects seen in and around Phoenix, AZ at roughly the same time made me think there was something more to what I saw. After returning home from a friend’s house on the evening of the 13th or 14th of March, 1997 at approximately 10:30pm (I remember it was around this time as I had returned from a vacation shortly before, but can’t remember if it was a Thursday or Friday), I went out on my back deck to look at the Hale-Bopp comet which was clearly visible with my small binoculars in the North-Western sky.  At that time I was and still am a Financial Analyst, but have always loved backyard astronomy since I was in Jr. High School and had an issue of Sky & Telescope which told me where to see it. While looking at the comet for several minutes with the binoculars, I saw a distinct flash of light, which caused me to lower them and look to see what had cause it.  For about 10 seconds or so, I saw 5 lights in what seemed to be a triangular formation move quickly from South to North from my perspective.  It moved very fast to the North until it was out of sight, but it was visible long enough to see that the triangular V formation was kept throughout.  There was no noise or contrail(s) visible (I expected to hear jet noises thinking it was a formation of fighter planes, but there was none). Unfortunately, it moved too fast for me to determine if it was a solid object. This obviously was quite exciting and unusual.  After spending a few more minutes trying in vain to see the object(s) again, I thought this was peculiar enough to report to someone. I looked in the phonebook for someone to call and eventually spoke briefly to a person (whose name I cannot remember) at the local MUFON contact number and gave him the description of what I had seen.  As it was quite late, I agreed to call back the next day to go over the sighting in more detail, but I did not call again.  After thinking it over and keeping in mind that the simplest explanation is most often the right one, I determined that it had to be a formation of fighter planes or maybe a stealth fighter which sort of has that shape. After seeing this documentary and subsequently researching the so-called Phoenix Lights on-line, what I saw and especially the time I saw it is a little too coincidental. I have never seen anything like that before or since, but due to the similarities with what was seen in Arizona, I thought it was time to report what I saw.

craft was seen hovering 100ft above the ground at the southeast corner of Powers and Platte at 9PM on 6/28/99 for about 20 seconds nort;1999-06-28 21:00:00;20 seconds;craft was seen hovering 100ft above the ground at the southeast corner of Powers and Platte at 9PM on 6/28/99 for about 20 seconds north of airport. I am a truck driver very familiar with this area. I was driving north on Powers Blvd about to turn left or east on Platte Ave.  I saw a very large craft that was either moving very slow or hovering.  I new I was by the airport and at first thought it was an aircraft.  Howerver, it was to large, moving to slow or not at all and like nothing I have ever seen. It looked like an ace of spades flying horizontaly with the pointy end forward.  Depth perseption of the craft was dificult to determine.  It appeared that you could see through some parts of the forward section and into parts of the middle section and the back seemed solid.  It was dark and I would say the craft was black. There were lights on the three points of the spade and interior lights that seemed to give the craft 3 decks at its thickest point.  Again, depth perception was unusual as the interior lights were not on what would normally be considered the hull, but rather within the craft. When I realized what I was looking at I was frightened, completed my turn on to Platte Ave. and sped off.  A co-worker was following me and when we arrived at the terminal he was going to say nothing.  I asked him did you see that?  He said Oh the triangle?  We walked to the west side of the terminal where we could see the corner where we had seen the triangle.  There was a small plane in a tight circular bank around the area we had seen the triangle.  We assumed the piolt had seen the craft also and was checking out the area further. I am 45 years old, have a bachalor's degree and have never seen anything like this before.  One other thing we were only about 100 yards away from it at most!  We also both saw the same thing.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

IT WAS SCANNING THE PEAK WITH ONE OF THREE SEARCHLIGHTS THAT WERE ON THE FRONY BOTTOM OF THE CRAFT, AND JUST THE ONE LIGHT LIT APPROXIMATELY A THIRD OF THE MOUNTAIN. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE HALOGEN. THE CRAFT THEN TURNED AND CAME OUR WAY. BY THEN I HAD MY BINOCULARS OUT AND HAD GOTTEN THE ATTENTION OF MY WIFE AND A FRIEND. UNDER BINOCULAR MAGNIFICATION THE CRAFT BECAME QUITE DISTINCT TO ME  IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET THICK AND 300 FEET IN LENGTH,BLACK,SILENT AND THE PROPULSION SYSTEM WAS A BAR OF BLUE LIGHT ACROSS THE BACK OF THE CRAFT. IMMEDIATELY BEFORE IT WOULD EXOCUTE A CHANGE OF DIRECTION THE BAR WOULD BEGIN TO GLOW INTENSELY LIKE A LARGER BLUE DOT ON THE EXISTING LIGHT STRIP. THE SPOTLIGHTS WERE ARRANGED IN A ROW AT THE UNDERNEATH FRONT PART OF THE CRAFT.THEY LOOKED LIKE THREE GLASS PODS AND LONG-OVAL IN SHAPE. IN THE CENTER BOTTOM THERE WERE FOUR RUNNING LIGHTS TWO WERE BLUE,AND TWO WERE RED. NOW, BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE SIDE OF THE CRAFT WAS DETAILED WITH A WINDOW AS LONG AS IT WAS ON THE SIDE AND THIS LONG WINDOW WAS LIGHT JUST LIKE AN OFFICE BUILDING AT NIGHT.THROUGH MY BINOCULARS AND NOT DREAMING I CLEARLY SAW APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 20 CREATURES IN BLUE UNIFORMS WALKING ON DECK GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS, DUTIES, WHATEVER.LINDA, THEY WERE NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS IN UNIFORM! BEFORE I SAW THIS CRAFT I WAS ALMOST A SCEPTIC ALL MY LIFE BUT THIS HAS CERTAINLY CHANGED MY POINT OF VEIW! THE CRAFT MOVED SLOWLY THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS OBSERVING IT, IT WAS SILENT AND IT GLIDED RIGHT ACCROSS THE CITY OF COLORADO SPRINGS FROM PIKE'S PEAK ON A DIRECT LINE TOWARD PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE. IT'S BERTH, I IMAGINE. ANYWAY, IT COULD BE. I'VE BEEN RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD BUT WHAT I SAW I JUST HAD TO SHARE WITH AT LEAST ONE PERSON WHO WILL LISTEN. MY WIFE AND FRIEND ARE STILL IN A STATE OF PUBLIC DENIAL AND WON'T DISCUSS THIS, EVEN WITH ME. THEY JUST WISH THEY'D NEVER SEEN IT!OH WELL! I DID AND I'M LETTING YOU KNOW. JUST OFFHAND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IT WAS UTITLIZING A TYPE OF LIGHT DRICE, HENCE THE SILENCE AND THE BLUE LIGHT. HOPE THIS HELPS! YOUR FRIEND, EDDIE.

I was gazing at a star/planet and for a very brief time 15-20 seconds I saw 3 lites in a lopsided triangle shape slowly moving right to left below this star/planet that I was looking at. I am not an astronomer so I don't know if it was a star or a planet. But the very slight movement caught my eye and I followed it for the 15 sec or so until it slowly drifted left and down until it went out of sight. The sky was clear with no clouds below but it appeared as though it drifted down into the haze or cloud layer below. It may have been one UFO or three flying in the lopsided triangle formation. The size and intensity of the white lights were similar in brightness and size to the star I was looking at. It was not an aircraft and it appeared and disappeared again so quickly I did not mention it to the Co-Pilot.

Triangle shaped, no lights, clear, like it was being cloaked, I could still make out the shape. VERY LARGE. Totally silent, very fast.;2003-11-22 23:30:00;30 seconds tops;Triangle shaped, no lights, clear, like it was being cloaked, I could still make out the shape. VERY LARGE. Totally silent, very fast. I went out to my vehicle to get my wife a pack of cigarettes, it was dark, very cold and a virtually cloudless sky. As I shut the door to my vehicle I looked up and immedialtely noticed what I first thought was a piece of clear plastic or cellophane floating or blowing in the sky. There was no wind and it was very calm. As I watched it closer I noticed its form and was very shocked and exited by what I witnessed.It was way up there.  It was huge, two or three football fields wide if not larger. It was clear, I could see the stars right through it. I could see the shape of a triangle, it did not have lights on it, but I could could see the shape of what I thought was the front. The pointed end was facing in the direction it was traveling in. It was absolutely silent. No sound at all. I lost sight of it. I ran around to the other side of the house and was able to see it again. It started to move very fast-Several hundred miles an hour. As I was watching it I could tell it was some kind of craft. The sky behind it seemed to get distorted. It was what I could only discribe as it was being cloaked. I ran down the block trying to keep sight of it. The event lasted no more than half a minute.  I did not imagine this event, nor am I making it up. I was totally sober. I can not imagine this type of vehicle being of this planet. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and he seemed quite credible to us.  He reported that there were no lights on the object.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
colorado springs, colorado saw  a object at night 3 multi-colored lights;2005-06-27 21:00:00;1-3 minets;colorado springs, colorado saw  a object at night 3 multi-colored lights at the time of this i was 15 years old(i am 16 now) and i was on vacation in colorado sping, colorado. i was staying in a hotel in..manituo?(that is spelled wrong) manituo springs. my mom said i HAD to go to this place called flying w ranch or something like that. and really i didnt care to be there. there was this thing that some people sang unill maby 11:00 pm.. pretty late. and i was pretty bored so i looked at the sky at about about after the first hour it starts wich was 7 or 6. since it was the mountains and i live in kansas it was beautifull to me. so basicly i ignored the music and look at the sky and the sunset. at about 9 i started try to spot out differant conssilations. i looked at oryans bet and i saw something wrong. there was an extra star. so i thought maby a sattilight off track or something because it looked like it was moving like a weather sattlight. but then it shot a littil ways to the north. i thought wow...that is a weird air plane. and didnt think anything of it. but i kept looking at it because then i noticed the star was more than one. it had three lights and they were differnt colors. one was blue i am shure of it. one was redish orange something of the mix. and other was greenish yellish coler. at that time i thought it was simply a very advanced jet the air force  had built. for as i had been told that area had a air force base near the area. then i was the craft shoot south. in a small triangluler shape.( if u conected the places it stoped) (the whole time i was wathcing it it seemed to be shaking or vibrated very fastly but not enuff to distort was i was seeing. (the whole time the craft was in the northern sky) every time it changed postions i looked farther than it went because it moved so fast i thought there was no way it could move that fast and stop so fast. (it moved so fast my eyes barly registerd that it moved) but anyways at it had moved in the northern part of the triangle it slowly seemed to be moving up maby farther from the atmospere. its very hard to explain. but the lights begain fading but not because of distance more of the width of the circles of light. the width begain getting slimmer and slimmer. and the lights begain changed shades to darker. and the craft all of a sudden shut of the lights. but i could still see it was there.( like black on black) the only way to describe it was that some people have good enuff eye sight to see the part of the moon that isnt being shone with light from the sun. baslicly like that. as i stated into the darkness of the craft in a split second it seemed to dissapere and i saw a few stars the apperd (normal stars) kinda like something was blocking it. aka the craft. when my mind finnaly register that i had seen somewthing i coudn't explain i kept thinking of aircrafts that might be simmiler to what i have seen. the only thing i could think of was the airplanes developed by canada that looked simmiler to a sauser. but this WASNT round at all. defanlty a triange the lights that i saw iluminated parts of the ship. it was gray. i didnt hear any sound cuz them dumb hillbillys were too loud. haha oh also i am sending a crrapy drawn picture that might help explain it if possable please call me or get back to me i would like to talk and further explain. ASK FOR ((name deleted)) OR U WILL NOT GET TO TALK TO ME thank you and i hope u consider me not crazy hahah.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Black triangle spotted in Pikes Peak region and slowly fades from sight.;2005-10-16 18:15:00;2 min.;Black triangle spotted in Pikes Peak region and slowly fades from sight. There were no clouds in the sky on this particular evening.I happened to look up as we left a family birthday gathering and spotted the triangle heading s/sw along the Pikes Peak front range.It appeared to be at an elevation of about 1000-1500 ft above the ground.The object was approximately the size of a football field (250-300 ft.)in length and about 100 feet or so wide.The object was moving very slowly. As I watched the object slowly turned and headed in a westerly direction (towards Pike Peak)As the object changed directions it seemed to simply fade from existence and disappeared.One of the most striking characteristics of this object was its ability to blend in with the night sky.It seemed as if you could look through the object and see the stars and sky but you could still see the outline and fact that this was a solid object.Very impressive.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Metallic, triangular object spotted hovering in broad daylight near NORAD.;2006-06-18 13:50:00;30 seconds;Metallic, triangular object spotted hovering in broad daylight near NORAD. On June 18th my girlfriend & I were driving South on highway 115 very close to the Fort Carson Base in Colorado Springs. We both independently spotted a metallic, triangular object which appeared to be hovering (no discernible movement or jet plumes visible)about about a 15-degree angle in the vicinity of Cheyenne Mountain, home of NORAD.  We both thought it might have been a large advertising balloon/blimp, but the object appeared to be much too high in altitude (maybe 1/4 mile high) and we could see no trace of attaching ropes or attached cables. We had a very clear view of the object as the skies were very clear that afternoon. We did not see any obvious lights and did not hear any noise. There was no obvious interference on the truck radio and cell phones were not in use.  We viewed the object for about 30 seconds and then lost sight of it when we passed some trees on the side of the road. When our view of the sky was restored (3 seconds time), the object had completely vanished.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Air Force fired projectiles of some sort at alien craft and hit them directly, causing all of the craft fired upon to hit the ground.;2007-03-19 11:22:00;1 day;Air Force fired projectiles of some sort at alien craft and hit them directly, causing all of the craft fired upon to hit the ground. I witnessed for the first time the most unbelievable thing that proves something I didn't believe in before I witnessed it occur. The United States Government scrambled jets to intercept groups of alien craft all day long as I sat and watched it from my living room window. I am in such disbelief, because like I said I was not a firm believer in life outside of our own planetary system. It is the truth, the craft I saw moved so quick, made no noise, but our craft being F-15 fighters I believe or something similar in nature, we able to use their weapons systems, perhaps modified systems, and shot them down...catching flame and landing in the mountain range of the Rocky Mountains. The craft, all 9 of them, fell from the sky when our weapons hit them, which indicated to me that in fact they were destroyed. Right now I am certain that because it did not make the news, that there is a top secret cover up, naturally the government wanting to keep this under wraps and I can understand the reasoning. The craft kept appearing, making me believe that we were not being successful in hitting them with our weapons systems. I saw trails, indicating something was fired from our craft towards theirs. Then I saw two craft together, indicating to me that in fact we were destroying their craft afterall, since they struck both craft together and they fell to the ground at a fast pace. The total number of planes of our aircraft varied throughout the day as they scrambled to attack them, but they arrived quickly and to my surprise given that our craft appear to be such lower in technology than theirs...but to my surprise again, simple systems of weaponry brought down what must have been intruders in our airspace and caught or detected by Space Command or Norad, or some other top secret detection facility...I'm convinced that we must have such things now that I am convinced that we've had bad visitors from outerspace. Their craft were triangular in shape, could move in any direction in an instant, but for some ! reason t hey weren't able to duck and weave whatever weapon it was that the United States Air Force was firing upon them, which was something unconventional you could tell by their streams that they left in the air...very different looking, almost as if to trace the location of the missiles from start to finish. I believe, knowing weapons systems very well from the Reagan era that are in use today, despite treaties, that satellites lit up the craft from the sky up high, and the missiles were guided directly to their targets without fail. I did see one alien craft seem to disappear in an instant, or it traveled from its location in an instant. All 9 craft that I saw were hit and fell to the ground behind some mountains. All scrambling jets ceased to fly once they were shot down, but it's not reported in the media and I haven't heard of anyone else seeing what I saw. So I do know it's being covered up in large scale. This is not the first sighting I've had with triangular craft. A group of about 7 or so flew directly over my condo one night, had zero noise in propulsion, flew very slow, and were lit up from beneath for all to witness, didn't seem to be afraid of showing themselves off. This event was in Lakewood, CO at the time probably 2 years ago.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Triangular light configuration indicated low flying hover-craft in fog and snow above Powers Blvd.;2007-04-12 20:45:00;30 sec;Triangular light configuration indicated low flying hover-craft in fog and snow above Powers Blvd. I was driving south on Powers Blvd in Colorado Springs, headed to the current/new airport to pick up friends who were flying in that evening.  The weather was foggy with a fair amount of snow beginning to fall, accompanied by a moderate breeze.  I'd stopped at a stoplight, located near the old Colorado Springs airport.  To my left (east), about 50 or 60 feet above the ground, I saw 3 identical, white colored, down shining lights (appearing similar to those housed in recessed can lighting fixtures) they were very, VERY slowly, smoothly hover-gliding forward, together.  Two slender blue-colored bars of light were positioned behind, and perpendicular to the nose light, but within the boundaries of the triangular configuration formed by the larger 3 white lights.  There may have been a small red light located between and/or just behind the blue bar shaped lights.  Due to the time of night and poor weather conditions, I could not see the body of the craft... just the lights on its under belly.  At first, I thought the lights were reflections on my windshield, but I couldn't determine their source.  I looked at other drivers around me to see if they had noticed the lights but they appeared to be oblivious as the weather/visability was poor and the drivers were concentrating on the stoplight, waiting for it to change from red to green.  The thick fog and snowfall reflected the street and city lights to provide a sort of overall orange glow.  Thinking that the lights were reflections, I remained still, using the frame of my windshield to verfiy that the lights were indeed moving, and that they weren't reflections.  The lights continued to glide, VERY slowly, foward.  The 3 lights formed an elongated, triangle configuration one round light in front (leading the direction of movement), with 2 identical round lights behind.  The overall size was approximately the size of an USAF F4 or F15. Since all the lights moved with identical speed and direction at the same time, it seemed probable that they were attached to one body.  There was no noise and the craft's movement left the fog and snowflakes undisturbed.  After moving forward, the hovering craft paused, then VERY slowly, smoothly made a slight banking action to it's right, then slowly and smoothly, (without rotating)it drifted in an easterly direction, to disappear, uncerimoniously into the fog and snowfall.  The craft's hovering was steady and constant, without bounce, shake, waver, list, or yaw it moved much smoother than a helicopter, seemingly unaffected by the poor weather conditions. It reminded me of a British Harrier, but, again, its movement was much, much slower, unwavering and smoother than that type of craft. The only movement that I can equate this craft's with are those displayed by some 3D computer generated and animated futuristic design aircraft... only this one was real.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
the second object appreared suddenly, then flickered out as the first object returned the way it had come.;2007-10-02 23:00:00;20 mins.;the second object appreared suddenly, then flickered out as the first object returned the way it had come. I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado. On Oct. 2, 2007 around 11:00 PM I was outside saying goodbye to a few friends.  As they drove away I looked up at the night stars and noticed something strange.  There was what appeared at first to be an airplane flying east to west toward an area between Pikes Peak and Cheyenne Mountain. The object was flashing red and white lights and was flying in and unusual jerking manner.  It may have been the irregually flashing lights that made it appear to be not flying straight.  A couple neighbors where out walking.  I mentioned what I was watching and they stopped for about 5 mins. and also saw the object.  After watching for about 10 mins. the object moved more south toward Cheyenne Mt. It was over the mountains now.  Then it disappeard for a quick second or two. When it reappeard there were two objects now flashing. They stayed together for only a couple mins.  The first (I think it was the first object) began heading back toward the east the same way it had come.  The other object remained stationary above the mountain.  The object above the mountain slowly flickered out over several minutes.  The other object continued headed east. As it passed overhead I could make out the shape of the craft by the configuration of the lights. I could make out four distinct lights.  It was triangular. After a few more minutes the object was no longer in my view.  It seemed like the second object became visible when the first object reached it's destination. I have seen similar objects with these kind of flickering lights over Colorado Springs previously.  However, I have never seen one appear out of no where.

I always gaze up at the night sky. I observed in the north sky a boomerang or triangle shape with many lights.. As the object came closer above my house the lights began to breakup out of formation, kinda of dancing.  It then formed back into the V shape.  I watched it disappear into the south sky.  I thought I must be crazy!  I just stood there... about 2-5 mins lapsed, and I turned around to the east sky and looked up and it had circled around again.  Same thing was happening...  The lights broke out of formation then back into the shape of a boomerang or triangle. This time it disappeared into the west sky.  I watched for many more minutes thinking I might see it again.  Nothing, I know what I saw was really there. I wonder if anyone else saw it in Colorado Springs?;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Witnessed multiple low flying triangular crafts with bright lights outlining its shape. Seen near military base.;2008-02-05 21:00:00;15 minutes;Witnessed multiple low flying triangular crafts with bright lights outlining its shape. Seen near military base. When traveling home on Highway 85/87, I witnessed a large, low flying, black triangular craft traveling sideways. The craft had multiple lights on its underside, placed in a triangular pattern, as well as outlining the craft. I turned onto another road, and followed the craft east. I saw nothing for about 4 or 5 minutes, then out of nowhere the craft floated above my vehicle. I pulled my car over, and watched as the craft slightly descended and glided over me. At this moment I determined that this could not be an airplane, as I could clearly see the entire outline of the craft. Upon reaching south Powers Boulevard, a second craft appeared, identical to the one previous. This craft again descended and glided over me. I became panicked as the craft continued to move in my direction. I turned my car around and began to travel west, towards my home. Eventually the craft ascended away from me, traveling north east. The third craft, identical to the previous two, was barely visible. However it was traveling in the same direction, at a higher altitude.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

I live very close to the back side of the locale air;2008-11-06 21:30:00;20 - 30 Minutes;I was driving to work on November 06 2008. I stopped for Sonic to eat before work. I live very close to the back side of the locale air port and 4 surrounding Military bases. I say this because I see lots of aircraft in the air at all times. I was in the drive up and I saw a strange pattern of lights on a plane or what looked to be a plane banking to the left to turn, but the object never turned and the light pattern never changed. I then saw a state police helicopter go in the same direction. I thought nothing of it at the time. I paid for my meal at the window and started driving to the base I currently work at as a Computer Systems administrator. I'm maybe a mile up the road still in town and I see the same object, flying very close to a residential area well under 300 feet in the air. I thought for a plane that’s close I sure don’t here any noise coming from it, so I rolled down my window and sure thing it did not make one sound. It soon dropped off of my vision and I keep driving. The road I’m on comes to a 4 way stop and is just off the back side of a locale air port and I see the same object coming from the direction of the air port and thought for sure this pilot must be trying to land or is having problems. I make my left hand turn at the 4 way stop and then a right on to the highway. The object at that time has stop in mid air just of the right of the highway I'm driving on. I'm coming up to the object and I see a row of well yellow lit windows so bright you can’t make out the inside compartment. But not a blinding eliminating light just well lit and yellow in color. I’m driving at about 30mph now and the object is to my right and I can see the underbelly it had green strips of lights all over the undercarriage of the craft and the body of the craft was black and blended in with the night sky so well I really could not make out the shape or even the hole size of the craft. It was very well triangle shape from the way the green lights were lade out on the bottom of the craft and! I rolle d down my window again and heard not one sound. At this time a second car had pulled over to the side of the road and started flashing its light and the object with out banking in any direction to the left or right to turn seemed to go back in the direction it came from towards the airport. I speed to the nearest cross section to make a u-turn and race to the airport with the object still in sight. I have to stop at a stop light and lose the object behind a set of buildings that a recently gone up in the last two or so years. Its very bright over buy the buildings as if the craft was hiding but the buildings are on a gated road I don’t have access to and I can' see the craft anymore. I'm leaving back towards work and I'm looking at the new buildings that I have never seen before and it seems there is a private run way and some indicator lights lighting up a run way path I've never seen before. And there seem to be an airplane hanger right behind this new building that’s just off the main run way to the locale airport, where I think this object my have landed and possibly if it was not a true UFO may have been stored away. Any way I tried to Google maps the location of the building and it seems they are brushed out of the picture or were not built when the photo was taken. I saw this craft up-close and for a very long time, I'm more then sure I'm not the only one in the area as it was flying very close to the ground and very slowly no aircraft other then a helicopter could have pulled off the speeds but not the maneuvers. I wish I would have had my camera to take photos. It was not any aircraft I have ever seen nor was it your typical UFO sighting as the object did not glow did not have over powering bright lights or laser beams. On the ride out to the baseI work at I saw what seemed to be more aircraft all NONUFO and very identifiable in the sky then I've seen in a long time it was as if they were looking for some thing. I will be keeping an eye out and would like to know where I could better report my f! indings or receive any information or any other repotted similar sights for that night in my area.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
UFO hovers off of mile marker 129 (Interstate 25) in Colorado Springs??;2009-03-01 21:30:00;15 minutes;UFO hovers off of mile marker 129 (Interstate 25) in Colorado Springs?? We were headed south on I-25 towards Pueblo, CO when at approximately 9:30 PM I saw a bright light ahead of our vehicle in the distance.  Assuming it was a low flying airplane or a helicopter with the bright search light on, I watched without much thought or concern.  After about 5 minutes passed I realized that the object had not moved and we were getting closer to it.  As we got near, the one light from the distance became two distinct lights with a couple red lights in between.  Again reminding me of a plane, however, this object was still stationary.  We actually passed the object at around mile marker 129 (it was to the east of the interstate) and at this point we could make out the three bright white lights in a triangle shape.  The object NEVER moved.  I also noticed some blinking coming from on top of the craft, I could make out two brighter white lights that would blink up high and one of the red lights blink below.  The craft made no sound and continued to hover as it got smaller in the distance of us driving away.  In total, I watched the object for about 15 to 20 minutes.  This length of time rules out the possibility of it being a low flying airplane because that would have come and gone in minutes.  The helicopter is the only logical explanation, but that doesn’t explain the silence nor the triangle shape of the lights (and I could be wrong, but I thought they could not hover in one spot for too long of a time).   Furthermore, I have seen many helicopters growing up in Colorado next to all the airports and air force base and I’ve never seen one stay perfectly still for as long as this did.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

I was in my back yard sitting down smoking a cigarette.  I live on Peterson AFB.  I saw triangle shaped craft flying almost overhead.  I saw a total of five really dim steady lights. Two where in the rear..two more in the middle..and one at the point of the craft.  For a few seconds it was reflecting the lights from the city.  It would have flown directly over the AFB/Airport for Colorado Springs.  It was traveling on a south to north path.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed and I heard no sound from it at all.  I didn't really see a color to this craft.  There is no moon and a I saw it reflecting the lights from town and the small emitting lights from it has well.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

I and my daughters observed an arrowhead shaped object over Colorado Springs, Co. Thanksgiving night. We were located 20 miles west in Woodland Park, Co. and observed the object to the east over Colorado Springs. The object had dozens of blue-green lights that would flash red, pink, magenta, and orange colors. Another fainter smaller but similar object was observed through the binoculars. After an hour it moved to the east.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Triangular shaped object with 6 to 8 orange colored lights, 3 on each side.;2009-12-17 21:00:00;5-15 seconds;Triangular shaped object with 6 to 8 orange colored lights, 3 on each side. Triangular shaped object with 6 to 8 orange colored lights. There were 3 lights on each side and I believe 2 on the backside. The ‘front’ end was open, as the side lights did not meet at a point. At approximately 21:00 hours I stepped outside on my front porch to smoke a cigarette.  I live close to an Air Force Base and the City Airport, less than 5 miles.  I have seen many military aircraft fly over my house, including the Stealth Bomber.  I have also worked at the airport for about 3 years. As I looked up at the stars I saw orange lights moving from North to South at a height of the same as a landing aircraft.  I did a double take when I realized it was not an airplane, or one that I would have recognized as there were no standard aircraft lights visible.  I tried to knock on the front window to get my wife’s attention, but to no avail.  I went to the street to follow the lights as they went south over my house and disappeared.  The event lasted about 5-15 seconds. I do not know if the lights vanished or disappeared in the distant haze. I did not see any type of body and the lights appeared they would be on the bottom of a craft.  I am uncertain if this was one craft or several in formations.  There was no sound at all.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

A reddish/Orange object traveling silently at a very high rate of speed at relatively low altitude.;2012-09-23 03:22:00;3-4 seconds;A reddish/Orange object traveling silently at a very high rate of speed at relatively low altitude. On 23 September at 0322 hours, I had stepped out of my Office at the Fort Carson 911 Dispatch Center (Lat: 38 degrees, 44’, 55.54” Long:  -104 degrees, 47’, 52.1912”) for a break. The sky was clear with 10 miles visibility, no wind relative humidity 72%, Temp: 43 F.   I was standing looking to the East/Northeast.  An object that was reddish in color came from the South/Southwest and continued on a North/Northeasterly path at a very high rate of speed.   The object did not appear to be very large and appeared to be relatively low, maybe 2000-3000 feet and made no noise at all.  If I had to put a shape to the object I would tend to say it was triangular.   My first impression was that it was an airplane until I registered its speed and the fact that there was no sound. The object covered a distance of 10-20 miles in approximately 3 seconds and continued out of sight.  It did not burn out but traveled at a constant speed and asthmas until out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.  He is a highly qualified witness.  The witness indicated to us that the object covered and arc of 160-180 degrees in the 2-4 seconds he observed it.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

I was checking the lights on my roof when I noticed three white triangular lights shoot across the sky, west to east, from Cheyenne Mountain out towards Peyton/Calhan way.  The motion was fast and low, somewhat sweeping too fast for an aircraft as it was completely silent. Speed was slower than a shooting star but faster than jet aircraft. Being as low as it was an aircraft would have created a boom we see jets daily here. It literally disappeared, no change in altitude, only a slight curve in trajectory and then it was gone.
