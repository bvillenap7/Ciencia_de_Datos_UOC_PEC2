Then disapears.;2003-11-24 17:00:00;5 minutes;Colorado Springs has Bright Stationary Object(s) that were filmed for about 5 minutes. Then disapears. I have this event on tape,  I cannot believe that this happened right under NORAD. The same mountains.  The tape I shot clearly depicts the mountains and craft(s) above it, not moving North to South or East.  West is the Rockies. The very bright object was extremly white, then changed shape to a square looking craft and changed colors from red, to blue-white. I showed this to my roommate so far. I have not contacted the military or media. Norad would be embarrassed to find this craft close to its own location. This is not a plane, balloon, hellicopter, It is very strange and was there for about 5-6 minutes. The thing next to it was very strange. Glowing type thing, smaller than the bright object and reflected (at times) from the other craft, it did change its position from the craft near the end of my filming. I really couldn't get the craft very well in focus, but in slow motion there are very strange events, designs, colors. Strangest thing I ever have seen. No mention of this in last nights television. That too surprised me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is forwarding film to our Center.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

White light in the sky, rising, getting brighter, then white orbs, then red light rising from cloud.;2014-10-11 18:26:00;7 minutes;White light in the sky, rising, getting brighter, then white orbs, then red light rising from cloud. I was standing on my porch, in Colorado Springs, CO, around 6:24 p.m. on Oct. 11, 2014, when I noticed an unusual light in the sky.  I am on the west side of town, and I was looking south, between Pikes Peak, and NORAD.  As I watched, the white light started going up, and getting brighter.  At this time, I asked to my wife to get my camera.  When I looked back, I now saw two white orbs, with one of them looking to be a lot higher in the sky than the other one. My wife came outside with the camera within a minute or two, and I started filming.  I lost track of one of the objects, and for some reason, I was having trouble keeping track of the other object.  After about one minute, I lost the object, and turned off the camera. At 6:30 p.m., I saw a red light rising slowly from a cloud, in the same area that I saw the white light, and white orbs, earlier.  I called my wife outside, and I lost sight of the object, while I was trying to show her where it was.  I turned off the camera, quickly spotted the object, and started filming again.  As we watched, it seemed to change color.  I got less than 30 seconds of video, that time, before I lost sight of the object again, and could not find it again.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Dark, elongated horizontal streak, which changed shape, seen by airline passengers over southern Colorado on January 12, 2016.;2016-01-12 14:00:00;3 minutes;Dark, elongated horizontal streak, which changed shape, seen by airline passengers over southern Colorado on January 12, 2016. We were passengers on an American Airlines flight from Seattle to Dallas (DFW) on the mid-afternoon of January 12, 2016, when we noticed a strange dark brown or black-ish streak or elongated smear to the north  high-lighted against the clouds.   As we watched this unusual sight, it suddenly had a roll upward so that the shape was more like an object with a long tail or smoke exhaust, but then it resumed the horizontal streak shape and very very quickly receded sideways to the north, in just a few seconds it disappeared.   Very strange!  We've been flying for over 50 years and have never seen anything like this.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Thin light accompanied with 2 orange orbs,Colorado Springs, CO.;2016-03-19 06:30:00;32 minutes;Thin light accompanied with 2 orange orbs,Colorado Springs, CO.   Saturday, March 19th, 2016, and a pre-dawn sky.                                                                   	 After backing up my van, facing east, I sat back awaiting the sunrise.  The time is 0630am.		In front of me, the skies were alight with hues of orange, pink, and purple colors.  A white color was also present, which I thought to be a cloud that had not colored yet.					  My glance continued northward, to see the glorious display of the morning colors manifesting themselves.													  Again my eyes returned to the sky in front of me and the “white” light had not moved or changed color.  It resembled the top half of a hamburger bun.   I said to myself “I’m going to watch you to see what happens”, when no sooner said, the” white” light started to COMPRESS itself, to flatten out to look like a thin, straight “light-line”. I couldn’t believe my eyes as I was engrossed and marveled at this happening!!!!!!!  												Now it started to move northward very slowly and from underneath, simultaneously appeared two(2) orbs, from white to glowing orange (2 mini suns came to mind), back to white and faded again simultaneously, all the while the “light-line” object travelled northward.						  It stopped and hovered for about a minute before starting to move back across the same flight path, southerly, passing it’s original point of sight, then stopping and hovering once again.			  The sun had just broken the day, when I averted my eyes to see momentarily, and when I looked back, it was gone.												  The location: Bear Creek Park, Co. Spgs., CO. 80905  							Total time of sighting was 32 minutes.									  Guess estimate of distance to be 25-30 miles.								  Using my left index finger, a foot away from my face, the “light-line” measured a” knuckle” inch.		   The location is also home to Peterson AFB, Schriever AFB  and Co. Springs airport;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Unusual object that seemed to change color Andrew sose;2017-12-28 15:48:00;10 minutes;Unusual object that seemed to change color Andrew sose Object that hovered over mountains and appeared to alter direction several times and vary in size/ shape.  Seemed much too large for a drone, and don’t think drone would be visible given the distance.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
One White Object Omitting Zero Noise Flying West To East Over Colorado Springs.;2019-05-29 09:45:00;30 seconds;One White Object Omitting Zero Noise Flying West To East Over Colorado Springs. I was in my backyard around 9:45 a.m. on May 29, 2019, when I noticed something odd flying in the sky.  It appeared very white against the bright blue morning sky.  The object was flying from West to East.  Just to my west is the Front Range Rocky Mountains and Mt. Cheyenne. It did not emit noise that I could hear.  It flew in a very straight line. The object had zero lights.  No wings or tail. It did not waiver up or down.  It did not tilt side to side.  Just flew in what appeared to be a straight line. Wanting to catch it on film, I ran inside my home and grabbed my iPhone.  I was able to record the object on video.  The video is terrible (of course ) as I couldn’t see it (the object) in the sky through my screen so I moved the camera around a lot but the camera was able to record it. When it flew behind (in?)(through?) a white cloud it was still visible although the top of the object appeared to become more white and domed-shaped with the bottom becoming rounder in appearance and darker. On video, when it comes out of the cloud it then looks to be 3 spheres in a close triangle formation. The video when slowed down and zoomed or viewed frame by frame is the best way to see it, but after a hundred times once you know what you’re looking it’s clear as day.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Changes shape, rotates, changes colors, does not move the way any airplane moves.;2019-10-16 23:45:00;0:45;Changes shape, rotates, changes colors, does not move the way any airplane moves. This is the 2nd time I saw something similar to what I saw in the summer of 2008 in Indiana. My fiance went outside to put trash to the curb, came back inside to tell me to check this blue light out in the northwest sky. He knew it wasn't a planet, wasn't a bright star, and didn't look like any sort of plane. A plane actually went by it, I'm sure miles apart in the sky, but from our perspective it was a couple feet. It doesn't seem like something the military would make because of the way it moved. It was a bright star similar to how bright Venus and Mars is, but it changed to red and blue, which at first we thought was an airplane, but it kept spinning in circles as if it was searching for something, when it was moving to the right it would become elliptical- like it was stretching, moved really slow, hovered and spun around and around. It would slowly move back and forth, up and down. It even made a zig-zag pattern in the shape of an S, my mom and daughter came out, while it was harder for our daughter to detect the movement, my mother saw it. And was shock no F-16 were up there investigating it. It even got dimmer at one point. And my fiance just checked it again now (01:17) and its further to the right of where it was when we first saw it. We were going to use our daughter's telescope- but couldn't find all the pieces we needed to get a closer look.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
I saw an object  flying near my home and I took dozens of photos of it from different angles;2020-05-15 09:30:00;10 minutes;I saw an object  flying near my home and I took dozens of photos of it from different angles I was standing in my backyard garden taking photos of birds and the flowers this morning. I live near a school, and there was someone playing a trumpet on the hilltop, I looked in that direction and noticed a single object reflecting sunlight, I had initially assumed it was a bird of prey. I took several photos of the object as it passed quietly over the sky beyond my house, catching the first image as it crossed behind my neighbor's chimney. I took over 30 images, but at that distance and without my glasses I could not tell what I was looking at. When I loaded the images on my computer I was shocked to see a strange object, and in the images it appeared to change shape a few times. I have the pictures, taken today. The object slowly moved across the sky, and then rose to a very high altitude when I lost sight of it, and stopped taking photos. ;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
