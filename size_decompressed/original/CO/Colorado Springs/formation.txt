Firework type of formation hovering south of Pike's Peak;2011-10-31 00:15:00;it has been about an hour;Firework type of formation hovering south of Pike's Peak I noticed the formation when I was driving home, South on Nevada. It caught my eye because I thought it was a firework, but then it never went away.  I was astonished, you could say, maybe confused, so I kept driving straight for about another 15 minutes to see if I could get closer to what I was seeing.  Trees eventually got in the way of my view, but as I was heading back, North on Nevada, I could see the formation in my side view mirror the entire way home. I live on a bit of a hill, so I have a view of it from my window. My window view is facing the Mountain Range.  I am seeing the formation South of Pikes Peak. It looks like a firework, a bunch of shimmering lights in a circle, but none in the middle.  The lights are pulsing, it seems like there is a rhythm.  They are colored red and white.  It seems too low for any government aircraft to be hovering.  I could email a few-second video I took.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Bright orange objects floating near NORAD.;2013-08-15 00:50:00;5 minutes;bright orange objects floating near NORAD At around 0:50, traveling South bound Powers Blvd, my roommate and I noticed at least eight very bright, orange-warm-colored and much bigger than any other lights or planes in the sky.  The objects were further south, between NORAD (Cheyenne Mountain) and Fort Carson.  They seemed to be stationary, one would fade out, then another would fade out and another would re-appear in particular pattern.  They were in small lines together, kind of lined up parallel of each other again in no particular pattern- just random clusters of lines.  We tried to continue South on Powers to see them, and eventually they all began fading out of vision.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Cluster of stars move after being at a stand still.;2014-01-01 00:05:00;2 minutes;Cluster of stars move after being at a stand still. My friend and I saw a clustered line of white stars to the north.  There were about 25-30 stars and they made a top-to-bottom style formation.  It was at a complete stand still when first observed.   Moments later, they all broke formation and went east across the sky at a slower than normal pace.  I tried to record it on my cell phone, but the camera couldn't capture the light in the night sky.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
One large object  followed by several silver lights in no particular order. The lights were following the larger object;2014-06-16 10:00:00;10 minutes;One large object  followed by several silver lights in no particular order. The lights were following the larger object I was parking my car on North Academy outside of the Dollar Tree when I saw a large object moving directly north towards me.  I could tell it was going way too slowly for a plane or a helicopter, and it took about 10 minutes to reach right above where I was standing and then veered off north west.   I grabbed the binoculars out of my car and I could barely make out a huge bunch of what looked like balloons (hundreds of them), BUT what was really weird is it had been followed the entire way by an escort of 8 or so silver colored lights.   They were up way higher than the large object and seemed to be following it.  I pointed them out to another lady who got out of her car and she said she could see them too.   When I first saw them I honestly thought it was a squadron of jet fighters, tailing a plane of some sort but they were not jet fighters and they all disappeared into the clouds when I lost sight of them all. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite eloquent, and serious-minded.  We suspect the the report is quite accurate.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
5 colored lights moving in sky east to west.;2016-08-01 21:30:00;2 minutes;5 colored lights moving in sky east to west. I was taking the trash out and looked to the east and saw 5 lights, 2 green, 2 red and 1 white.  They moved over the sky heading west at a somewhat fast pace, as they passed behind a cloud they went into a 5 point pentagon shape and then faded out.   I'm not sure what it could of been.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Ok so i was living in Colorado springs CO in an apartment close to NORAD base and on that night me and my boyfriend were laying in bed;2017-06-12 23:00:00;03/2017-06/2017;Ok so i was living in Colorado springs CO in an apartment close to NORAD base and on that night me and my boyfriend were laying in bed and my 5 year old child wanted to sleep in there with us so he was next to the bed on his new sleeping bag.  I had the window open and the door cracked shut.  There was a full moon so there was a good amount of light coming in and the wind was blowing so the door was kind of banging so i was kind of zoned in looking at the door thinking should i close it all the way when suddenly this shadow creature that was darker than night shot out from the corner at the door and moved faster than anything ive ever seen into the other corner and disappeared into the other corner.  It was a shadow from a car or anything like that it definitely was some kind of shadow creature. My 5 year old jumped on the bed his heart was racing and my boyfriend turned to me and asked did you see that?  What was that?  I was like o don't know?!  But all i got was this feeling of dread. It only stood maybe 4 feet and was darker than the night. I moved from that apartment not long after that and there was other things that happened before but i kind of ignored it but after that i was gone.  It was too creepy and scary for me to live there and after that i kept all lights on all the time.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
I noticed what I first thought was Orion’s Belt but it was moving   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-03-05 19:40:00;15 minutes;Walking dogs with two of my daughters and as we started to turn west, I noticed what I first thought was Orion’s Belt but it was moving....we stopped and watched a formation starting in the west under and South of a very bright Venus and moving up and North/Northeast and all seem to disappear when they were near the Cassiopeia constellation.   From the time they became visible to us to when they disappeared was approximately 20-30 seconds and we counted nearly 40 of them.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
