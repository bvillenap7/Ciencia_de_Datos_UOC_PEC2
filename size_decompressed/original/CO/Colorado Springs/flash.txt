Bright Flash directly overhead.;1990-07-15 03:00:00;5 seconds;Bright Flash directly overhead. I was laying in a chair in the backyard watching a satellite make repeated passes overhead.  A bright flash occured directly overhead.  The flash was the color of a camera flash. It appeared something very far away exploded.  The distance to the flash seemed to be out of the solar system, even as far as to a distant solar system.  No sounds were heard.  The time is correct within a couple hours, the date it occured was summer of 1990. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Flash may have been due to the reflection from an Iridium satellite, if, in fact, they were in orbit during 1990.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

The star m;1998-04-28 22:42:00;3 minutes;Two people witnessed an extremely bright star  flash on and fade out in the night sky for approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  The star moved in a steady pace in a northerly direction until it was too far to see it any more. On 28 April 98 at 10:42 pm  I looked up at the night sky and noticed the Dipper directly above me.  (Do not know if it was the big or little dipper.)  At this time I noticed that the brightest star blink out.  I kept looking and saw that it reappeared in a slightly more northern attitude.  It faded out again and reappeared at a more northerly position.  I yelled for my husband to come out and he too quickly found the star.  While he tried to identify it with binoculars, I counted the seconds between fades and reappearances.  Counting in a measured One-One Thousand way, this star blinked on after 8 seconds ... in all cases in a more northern position. (This position, according to my compass, had the slightest northwesterly slant to it, but I cannot confirm the actual degree.] The only way to measure the distance between the sighting and the reappearance would be to say that with arm extended, the thumb extended, the space between would have been as wide as my thumb. Binoculars did not improve the detail of the object, which had no color other than the bright white of some closer stars. We watched it until we could no longer see it. ((NUFORC:  Sighting possibly explained by tumbling object in polar orbit.));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Bright Flashing extremely white lights.;2005-09-24 23:00:00;6 Min;Bright Flashing extremely white lights Approximately 2300 hrs., my wife noticed two strange flashing lights.  When we noticed them they were east of Colorado Springs flying north.   There were two crafts, one would flash a very bright white light twice and the other would flash six times in about 2 sec.   They would repeat this cycle every 7 or 8 sec. They continued north till they were north of Colorado Springs and turned to the west and then flew southwest over the mountains until they disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the observers witnessed, but the pattern of the strobe lights, we note, is not uncharacteristic of the strobes on a helicopter.

As i was standing on my back pourch around 1:00 am looking up at the stars i saw a bright flash.  This flash appeared out of no where,also it was going way to fast for it to be a plane.

The flash though only lasted for about 3 seconds and vanished.After that i was still surveying the sky hopeing it would appaered again,and that's when i saw these planes following in the same flight direction.

Three flashing objects in night sky over Colorado Springs.;2015-05-13 21:50:00;Few seconds;Three flashing objects in night sky over Colorado Springs. Caught two flashes and one very slow trailing object in the night sky.  Flashes were bright and dimmed slowly.  Two front objects were moving at about twice the speed of an aircraft.  Most likely two front objects were around cruising altitude for airliners and trailing object appeared much higher.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

This is a normal procedure I find myself doing on my late shift nights, especially when it is dark. Having used my small flashlight and having identified no immediate danger I cautiously started walking towards my car when, out the corner of my eye and to the right, I picked up something that looked like bright lights or a fire towards the southwest area of town near Fort Carson and/or Cheyenne Mountain AFB.  Turning my head to get a better look I saw what appeared to be a bright string of amber colored flare like lights that at times appeared connected and at times with gaps between them.  At first I thought they may have been aerial flares or illumination rounds fired from the artillery ranges at Fort Carson.   However, I quickly determined that they were not acting like flares and too high to be ‘Illum’ rounds.  In fact, they appeared to flicker in and out by disappearing and reappearing for lack of a better explanation. As I looked harder, it appeared that these lights were above the flashing antenna lights on the very top of Cheyenne Mountain.  I could not quite put together in my head what I was actually seeing and could not fully determine if the object was actually one or many items and if it was moving or spinning (from possibly right to left) or if there was an illusion of movement due to its flickering nature. Suddenly after about a minute or less of this, the object or objects suddenly disappeared and did not come back.  I saw one of my coworkers getting into her car nearby and I yelled out if she just saw that to which she replied she did and made some half joking comment about a flying saucer.  My whole drive home, which was 12 miles in a southerly direction down Powers Blvd, I made sure to keepe an eye out on the sky, however, I never saw them again. At around 20:55 hours, from home, I called a local new station’s news desk, KKTV I believe, and spoke with someone named  Tony and asked him if anyone had called in reporting a string of amber colored lights in the sky. He immediately became excited at stated I was the first report from Colorado Springs and that he has been getting reports of such a thing for the past hour from Pueblo which is just south of Colorado Springs.  He even volunteered that he was going to call NORAD and ask them if anything was going on and that someone had even sent video which he intended to put on the station’s Facebook page. As of the following morning, there were no news reports or video.  I talked to my coworker and she stated that she saw the same thing I did and added that the incident seemed to cause the antenna lights on top of Cheyenne Mountain to flicker on and off, something I did not, myself, seem to pick up on. I am a veteran of the US Army and former law enforcement.  I have seen numerous aircraft and aerial flares over the years and can positively state I have never seen anything quite like this.  However, I am open to the possibility that this sighting could be due to military aircraft and/or flares. The lights were bright and amber colored, much larger than stars but smaller, although brighter, than the moon.   There was a slight wind where I was at but I do not know what the weather was like in the area where the lights were. Postscript: I have waited over a year to post this and was on the fence, so to speak, about doing it at all for reasons personal to me.  However, 3 recent Joe Rogan podcasts have changed my mind.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

In my peripheral vision, I saw a very large, yellow, bright light which I believe moved from top of patio downward, but it was hard to say.  It happened very fast.  It was extremely bright.  I went to look off my patio balcony and there was nothing.  There were no people at all in the courtyard.  I thought it was a firework, but there was nothing on the ground or anywhere and no people at all.  When it happened, there was a slight whirring noise.  It really rattled me;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
