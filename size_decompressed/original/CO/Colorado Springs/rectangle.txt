I was wondering if anyone else in Colorado Springs, CO noticed the object near Pikes Peak, possibly close to Woodland Park, CO? This would be looking southwest from my house Pikes Peak on the left of the object. I observed what appeared to be a very bright PARALLELOGRAM (exactly what it looked like) yellowish glow, either moving very slowly or nearly stationary. I brought out my field glasses but could not make out any other lights in fact, there seemed to be dark splotches scattered on it (not symmetrical, just random). Oddly, I could not really get it into focus (it was kind of shimmery), although I could focus on the visitors center (sharper but much smaller) at the top of Pikes Peak fairly easily. It was quite large in comparison to the visitors center so it seems I should have been able to see more detail. Trying to use my videocam and my digital still camera proved fruitless...I couldn't even see it in the viewfinders.  It was visible for approximately two hours and appeared to move only slightly from right to left at one point it was partly obscured by trees which is how I could detect the motion. It did not move up or down, just slowly side to side. It was an absolutely perfect parallelogram (I even looked up a photo of a parallelogram just to make sure). I made my husband come out and look he saw it but kind of shrugged it off even though he had no explanation for it.  Size-wise, using the Pikes Peak visitors center as a standard, it was at least five times larger.  I believe I have seen only one other UFO in my life and that was over 25 years ago in San Diego, CA. I called a local TV station about that one (cigar-shaped with colored lights) and other people had also called in about it. I did not call any local TV stations this time (I probably will in the AM) as it was getting late. When I went out to check on it again around midnight, it was gone.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

About 30,000 feet in the air I saw two white rectangle shaped objects that were about a few hundred feet apart from each other. Slowly one of the objects moved closer to the other one. I looked down for just a second to grab my phone and they were gone when I looked back up.  It was a clear day with a few wispy clouds here and  there.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
