I was riding the shutlle bus to school and I glanced over the mesa at U.C.C.S. I saw four silvery oval shaped objects hovering near the radio towers.  It seemed that they were slowly moving away to the east.  The objects were in a pattern: two closer to the west directly above each other and two directly above each other to the east.  I can't belive no one else on the bus saw them (there were about 30 passengers!). I got off the bus walked in front of a building.  The pair of closer zeppelins had dissapeared.  The pair further to the east slowly drifeted away.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

Took a picture of Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado while I was there this week.  Looking at the picture there appears to be a craft over the mountain.  There are also purple concentric circles along with what looks like a reflection in line with the suspected craft.  It's all the picture as I did not notice anything while I was taking the picture.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
UFO in Colorado Springs/Manitou Springs area;2006-08-29 06:45:00;10 minutes;UFO in Colorado Springs/Manitou Springs area I was pulling into the HP parking lot and was blinded by what appeared to be an airplane at first.  I thought to myself man this plane is flying awfully low to make a turn into the airport.  This thing was in the proximity of Manitou Springs area and litterally blinded me.  I slowed to a halt and could see it was very clean silver in color with lights around the base.  IT NEVER MOVED from hoover position.  I turned to gain a better vantage position but lost site of it as I moved down into a troft like position in the parking lot.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

A Brightly Colored Object appeared in front of Pike Peak, north/west of NORAD in Colorado Springs.  The light flashed a blue, purple, and green.  The object was by far the brightest object in the sky.  The UFO hovered and at about 30 degree angle in the western sky and made erratic turns and achieved incredibly fast speeds.  This anomaly lasted for approximately three minutes and was witnessed by six other people.   I have never witnessed anything like this before.  I was quite surprised and excited by the sighting.  It was impossible for me to tell the distance or size of the object, but if I were to hold my arm extended out in front of me it was the size of my thumb nail.  I witnessed this from the east and the object was directly west from me.   According to the other witness this is the third sighting in three weeks.  I will be out with a Camcorder from now on.
