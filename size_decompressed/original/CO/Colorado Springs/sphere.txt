Sphere light UFO seen near Pulpit Rock, CO.;1986-06-14 18:30:00;2minutes;Sphere light UFO seen near Pulpit Rock, CO. Location of Witness: Sunset Creek Apartments (F.K.A. NorthRidge Apartments) off of N. Nevada Ave. and I-25. (west of Pulpit Rock) Location of Sighting: Near and Around Pulpit Rock (about 4000 feet from apartments). Looking out one of the apt. windows, viewing the rock possibly after a rainstorm and watching the rainbow, I saw a mysterious ball shaped object floating south in a staight horizontal line toward the middle near the top of the rock. It was golden-white, sometimes with a bluish tone. I knew that it wasn't an airplane or any known flying object, especially since it never had any blinking lights, made any noise and lacked other shape than a sphere. I felt entranced everytime I saw it. The most peculiar thing about it, was that after reaching the rock, it appeared as if going behind it, yet never came out the other side! I have hiked the rock many times in my life and there is no trace of any aircraft landing, nor any place for a helicoptor or even a smally plane to land, since it is very treacherous terrain, behind the rock, ie., rocky hills and ravines with lots trees and uneven territory. In recent years, I came to conclude that this object may have not even entered behind the rock, but perhaps into the rock itself, judging by the rocks enormity. I not only had seen this phenomenon on this occasion, but aproximately three to four other times, in a span or two to three years, always in the same location...and horizonal direcion and height. The appearance of this happening occured usually in the mid summertime, and always durring the early part of the evening, where it was still lit outside. It was usually after it rained and the sky was almost all clear, yet I observed the same occurance on a clear evening, where it had not rained at all! I do not recall any other witnesses beside me, I was perhaps alone in the room everytime. I always felt that Pulpit Rock was a Strange and Mystical place, where I always felt drawn to. Up to this day, this place is like a magnet to me....It energizes my spirit, stimulates my Higher conciousness, and body and a peculiar something that isn't logical and radiates from it.

The object looked to me like a soccer ball, it was round, silver colored and motionless while I watched it.;1999-09-17 09:00:00;30 seconds;The object looked to me like a soccer ball, it was round, silver colored and motionless while I watched it. My UFO Experience  This is what I saw in September of 1999.  (Exact date unknown)  I was working at the MCI building at Garden of the Gods Road and 30st Street in Colorado Springs.  It was about 8:45 to 9:00 am and I was driving my Datsun to work.  The sky was clear and blue, with no clouds to West and no noticeable wind.  I was driving West on Vindicator when I stopped in the left hand turn lane for the traffic light at Centennial Blvd.  The light had just turned red in front of me.  The red light for traffic coming from Vindicator lasts 40 seconds.  There were only a few cars on the road at that time.   As I sat there, I happened to look up toward the West.  I saw a round, soccer ball shaped object in the sky over the Mountain Shadows neighborhood.  I just stared at it for several seconds not believing what I was seeing.  I rubbed my eyes and blinked several times to make sure I was really seeing something in the sky.  The object was a light silvery color and was to the West-Southwest of where I was stopped.  The object sat there motionless for the entire time the traffic light was red and while I was watching it.  I did not see any windows or markings of any kind on this object.  My first thought was that it was a hot air balloon as the Labor Day Balloon Classic in Colorado Springs had just occurred.  But there was NO basket or harnesses hanging from or attached to this object. I tried to judge the height and distance while looking at it.  I was thinking that it was to the East of the ridge which runs on the West side of Mt. Shadows.  It looked like it was above the Western most point of the Flying W Ranch Road (which is what Vindicator turns into on the other side of Centennial).  This would be about one mile from where I was.  The height of this object seemed to be a little above the high points of the rock ridge in back of the Mt. Shadows area.  The high points in this area are a little over 7000 feet.  The intersection where I was at is a little over 6600 feet. While I was stopped at the red light watching this object, I noticed people going into and out of the Walgreen's store across the street.  Other cars were traveling on Centennial Blvd. in a normal manner.  I did not see anyone else (walking or in cars) viewing or appearing to view this object. When the light turned green for me I made my left hand turn and proceeded South down Centennial.  I don’t believe that there were any cars behind me at the traffic light.  I tried to keep the object in sight, but the object was to my right and there were houses and trees along the road I was traveling.  It took about 4 minutes before I arrived in the MCI parking lot.  (I later timed this trip at 4 minutes, 15 seconds and the distance was 2.3 miles)  When I got to the MCI parking lot, I looked back toward where I had seen the object, but the sky was empty.  I looked in all directions and there was nothing.  If this had been a hot air balloon it would have still been visible to me somewhere in the sky. I don’t know exactly what I saw that day, but it Was there and it was Real…. At the time of the sighting I was working as a software quality assurance tester at MCI.  My occupation for the previous 40 years was as a software developer and software tester for several large aerospace companies.  My positions at these companies required me to obtain security clearances.   I was 60 years old at the time of the sighting.  I remember the object I saw as being very vivid in detail.

Dark Spherical UFO sighted in the early evening in the colorado springs CO area.;2001-02-02 18:00:00;30 min;Dark Spherical UFO sighted in the early evening in the colorado springs CO area. I had taken a friend to her storage shed.  It was early evening but still quite dark.  The moon was visible and next to it venus (I presume).    As I looked at the moon I noticed what appeared to be 3 small stars (very dim and white in color).  On closer observation I noticed an outline of a dark spherical craft.  The craft seemed to be very large and very high in the sky but was clearly outlined. the little lites changed briefly from 3 to 5 and then back the lights were on the bottom of the craft.  The craft was motionless and seemed to just hang there.  This thing must have been huge!  There was no sound or any motion.   I pointed the craft out to my friend and she glanced up and said that she thought that i was seeing stars.   We drove to my moms house and I pointed it out to my mother who was able to see the crafts outline as well.  It had remained in place for the entire 20-30 minutes that I observed it.  The following night and for the last week I have been looking for it and haven't seen it or any small grouping of stars that should have been present if that was all I was seeing.  I would greatly appreciate it if anyone else has had a simular sighting.  I expected that a UFO would be bright and saucer shaped not spherical and dark.  I had the feeling that it didn't wish to be observed and that it was observing something --- there is a great deal of military stuff in the springs like NORAD and the SDI-testbed and the consolidated space operations center etc..

Glowing silver-blue sphere which vanished.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Iridium satellite flare?  PD));2002-07-23 03:00:00;20 seconds;Glowing silver-blue sphere which vanished I went outside in the early morning/late night, to have a cigarette.  I walked out a ways and went to a tree ((deleted)) and looked up at the sky and saw a slow moving, glowing blue sphere.   I couldn't gauge distance, or size.  It was moving slower than an airplane, but it wasn't an airplane, or a helicopter, because there was no sound and the lights were different than that.  It wasn't a satellite because there was clouds that would block view of satellites.   I watched it for five seoncds then thought, Just what the hell is that?   Right then it stopped, glowed a litttle brighter, and then vanished.   I stood around for a few minutes hoping to see it again.  Then the hair on my body stood up and i thought I heard sounds like wind in two different points approx thirty yards out in the woods and got scared and went inside. ((NUFORC Note:  May have been the characteristic flare from an Iridium satellite.  We are not certain that this report is intended as a serious account.  PD));38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987
Unknown sphere seen in relatively close range moved rapidly and suddenly stopping and changing positions placement in the sky.;2003-09-24 10:55:00;10 minutes;Unknown sphere seen in relatively close range moved rapidly and suddenly stopping and changing positions placement in the sky. Noticed a bright glowing object travelling along the front range of Colorado Springs, going north towards the Air Force Academy. Several minutes later, I heard several sirens in the area of Fountain Blvd. and Murray Blvd. These sirens, three to four sets were headed west on Fountain. I was outside taking a break, while at work, I turned to check the area west of my location.  Within one block, just over the Sand Creek Police Dept. I observed a very white sphere travelling from the west and heading towards my position. This sphere, started to go upwards from just above the Police station.building.  As this sphere rose rapidly, it started to glow to yellow and orange color. While rising the sphere was travelling towards my location.  A couple of people, co-workers, saw that I was intent on looking upwards and came out and observed the sphere travelling above our building.  We observed this object suddenly stop in the 11 o' clock position. I walked into the building and one other guy stated that the object moved extremely fast to the 2 o' clock position.  This took place within a few seconds of me walking into the building.  Within just the few seconds that I was away. The object seemed to be small in diameter and was completely still in the sky. About five of my co-workers saw the object at different stages of the sighting.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

Sitting mid-day in the backyard we noticed these clear spheres with something silver inside. Some 50+ of them moved in a group and had some stragglers taking up the rear.  We sat and just watched them.  Unbelievable – these were something we had never seen before nor could compare them to anything we know of.  They moved quickly and in a group.

White Sphere seen over mountains Colorado Springs;2017-01-01 13:50:00;<1 minute;White Sphere seen over mountains Colorado Springs As I came to a red light waiting to turn left I was looking West out to the Pikes Peak mountain range.  The clouds were hanging over the mountains, and I noticed one little white dot in a small space of blue sky between the clouds.  It looked as white as the clouds, but it caught my attention as it was a perfect sphere and it was motionless.  On a whim I went to grab my phone to try and video it, but before I could even grab my phone the object move directly down in a steady pace and was gone behind clouds and the mountain range.  I knew it wasn’t a helicopter, and the way it moved was similar to what I have seen in some supposed UFO videos.  I was so moved by the experience I pulled right over and posted to Facebook what happened.  It was exciting to say the least, and quite an interesting start to the New Year.;38.8753097510373;-104.772105082987

They appeared to be about 2-1/2 feet away from my window. They looked to be about 2” to 3” apart from each other. They were white and you could not see through them. The day was clear blue skies from my angle on the floor. I heard nothing, my windows were closed. They seemed to be traveling in a straight line at about 35 miles per hour.
