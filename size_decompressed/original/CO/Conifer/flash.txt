Standing on my deck and it looked like something flew through the mountain range/Valley.  It looked like a shooting star at first but it flew straight and too low, at a speed too fast for anything man made, then it disappeared.  About 1 minute later it came back and was moving and flashing oddly back and forth, up, down and sideways like it was scanning the ground below or looking for something.  I ran into grab my phone and turn all my lights off and it was gone.  All the dogs in the area started barking at the same time.;39.5224;-105.3209
