Turkey Creek Canyon Road, Conifer Colorado sighting (3 witnesses);1995-05-05 22:00:00;10 seconds;Turkey Creek Canyon Road, Conifer Colorado sighting (3 witnesses) A couple of friends and myself were driving to the mountains in colorado after seeing a movie. We usually take the main road up to Conifer, CO, but we decided to take the side road (Turkey Creek Canyon Road) this time. We were travelling about 30 mph when I noticed a glowing light up by the ONLY street light on that road. Just as I noticed the light it moved VERY QUICKLY towards the windshield (I thought it was going to hit us) then travelled with us for about 2 seconds when the driver suddenly hit the brakes and swerved out of the way at which time it QUICKLY flew off to our left through a clearing and over the ridge out of sight. The driver and I got out of the car and his date remained in the car crying and very scared. When we returned to the car we gathered our senses and I demanded that we each write down what we saw (as to avoid convincing each other of our encounter). When we compared what we saw, we all came to the same conclusion that we had seen a UFO. It was a translucent image about the size of an SUV. It had, what appeared to be a fan propeller, but it moved rather quickly for it ot be powered by a propeller. We could tell it had a very bright light because when it took off to our left it lit up the trees around it before darting down the ridge about 60-100 yards away.;39.5224;-105.3209
