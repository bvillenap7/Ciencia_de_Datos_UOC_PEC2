5 or 6 lights in day sky.;2003-07-13 13:00:00;8 minutes;Vacationing in Steamboat Springs, sitting in hottub, and noticed 5 or 6 lights in day sky.  The lights were visible for only a second or two, would fade out, and reappear in roughly the same location in the sky, but had moved in relation to one another.  I watched this for three minutes or so, ran to get my camera, and tried to get some shots.  After a few more minutes the lights disappeared.  My camera was on auto focus and I don't think my pictures will turn out.  I'll be ready if they come again this week.  I'm a huge skeptic but these lights truly have me confused.;40.6299490909091;-106.92994
Six red orange lights over tree line that made different shapes.  Viewed for over an hour.;2015-12-31 23:00:00;1 hour;Six red orange lights over tree line that made different shapes.  Viewed for over an hour. At 23:00 while working on the local ski area got out of the machine I was running to move a fence when I noticed a red orange light just above the tree line.  It was joined by a second light higher and to the left.  I watched for a few moments and noted that the lights were moving.  I went back to work continueing to watch and within minutes there were six lights.  Over the next hour the lights would disappear and reappear make shapes ranging from triangles to crosses to L shapes.  At first I thought someone was using a bunch of lasers but looking at where they were in the daylight that wasn't poosible.  My other thought was someone was flying drones but even that was ruled out.;40.6299490909091;-106.92994
