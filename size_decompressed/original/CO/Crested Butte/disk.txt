Craziest UFO Siting. 6 over a two hour period.;2016-05-04 04:00:00;2 hours;Craziest UFO Siting. 6 over a two hour period. I couldn't sleep last night, and so I went outside to look at the stars, it was four am... I saw FIVE ufos.  It terrified me.  They were coming from the south east and headed north west. They were probably about 15 mins apart from each other.  Large disks, with 2 rows of large round red lights around the bottom.  I eventually went inside and just looked out the window at them.   My fianc√© wouldn't get up to look, and my phone died.  Probably one of the scariest things I have encountered.  I didn't want to leave the window, so I just kept staring at them and swearing to myself (as one could probably imagine).  I eventually got the courage to go outside again once the sun started to rise.  I sat  down and watched one as it slowly drifted away and then out of nowhere a silver disk went flying into the sky at Mach speeds... It was different from the other ones I saw earlier.  The way the stars were last night it almost looked they had some sort of galaxy highway to follow! ... They all followed suit above the same star. It was just so weird;38.8691;-106.9619
