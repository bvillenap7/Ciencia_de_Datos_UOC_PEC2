Also have seen great amount of activity READ ME! It was broad daylight and i witnessed a metallic looking craft hovering over our valley in crested butte. It was situated at a high altitude I would guess over 20,000ft.  After i watched it hover for a short time it left to the west from a stand still hover to going over 2,000 mph in an instant.  I basically have seen dozens of separate sightings here in the gunnison valley.  This place is constantly having something odd in the sky above and the activity seems to originate most often from the main visible belt of the milky way.  if it is going to help someone may contact me.  I have seen too many things that arent natural to us on earth above crested butte to stay silent anymore.;38.8691;-106.9619
