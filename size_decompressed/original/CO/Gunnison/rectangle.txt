Red glowing sphere hovering just about skyline moving back and forth.;2018-11-12 19:00:00;1 hour;Red glowing sphere hovering just about skyline moving back and forth Rectangular shaped craft with a circular bright glow around it brighter than a star, almost looked like a planet but in the wrong spot.  Hovered and went side to side in the sky near the skyline just after sunset.  Stayed for about an hour then disappeared.  Has been occurring around the same time and place each night since (3 nights, 11/12/18-11/14/18) Odd colored lights were seen coming from it and it seems to hover in circles almost looking for something.  Several military looking aircrafts were seen flying around near it maybe trying to check it out.  It was a weird time of night for so many planes, around 6-8 pm mst.  Planes also usually donâ€™t fly this direction (not a normal flight path).;38.5536851239668;-106.922734710744
