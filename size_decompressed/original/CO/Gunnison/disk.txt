Daylight sighting while ice fishing on a lake in South Western Colorado.;1998-03-15 14:30:00;30 Seconds;Daylight sighting while ice fishing on a lake in South Western Colorado. Sunday afternoon the weather at 9300 ft. was very comfortable. There were a few clouds but a lot of very blue sky. We were fishing on the SW side of the lake looking to the N. when Jim said look at the UFO. I very luckly look in the correct direction and saw the object quickly. It was falling parralell to a E facing slope that we were sitting beside. I thought it was going to crash. It then stopped for a second and then speed at about 2 oclock. It went into a cloud and never came out. This,what used to be a small cloud the began to enlarge and move directly over us like no other clouds around. I told Jim that something else was going to happen but it didn't. Not Yet anyhow. That evening because of warm temperatures the ice had become slushy and we had to abandon our snowmobile,ice fishing sled with all of my fishing gear, and 6 21 Lake trout. Everything on the sled was very secure with four bungie cords. The next morning we drove out on another machine. We observed that there were not any tracks from birds or fopur legged animals. 4 out of 6 of our fish had vanished. I wonder ?;38.5536851239668;-106.922734710744
