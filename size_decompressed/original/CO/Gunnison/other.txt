I do NOT believe it was a refueling craft. My husband and I viewed what appeared to be a large jet with three smaller aircraft off of one wing and four off the other.  These aircraft seemed attached by a cord.   Another smaller aircraft was behind the tail of the jet, also attached.  The smaller craft were on the exact same axis as the wings and did not change angle or distance from the main aircraft.;38.5536851239668;-106.922734710744
