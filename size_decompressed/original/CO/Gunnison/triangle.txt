We both observed a triangular shaped aircraft with many orange lights and a few blue lights streak across the sky, the rear end of the aircraft also had an orange glow.   This aircraft was larger than any plane I have ever seen and was flying low and did not make any sound.  I believe that if it were a plane, perhaps it was a stealth bomber, but it is likely that even if it were a stealth bomber flying that low it would have had to make some noise.   There is an air port in town and we are used to seeing military aircraft training, but I but I believe this was out of the ordinary enough to report it as a UFO;38.5536851239668;-106.922734710744
