I watched a white sphere shaped object move from the North to the South.   I watched it through a spotting scope and it looked like a golf ball.  Just a round sphere with nothing hanging from if.   My wife saw it, too.  We watched it for about an hour and then cloud cover stopped our view.;38.5536851239668;-106.922734710744
