giant bright white light moves autonomously and travels EXTREMELY fast. SILENT!;2007-04-15 22:00:00;2 min.;giant bright white light moves autonomously and travels EXTREMELY fast. SILENT! I was walking my friend Mariah home at about 10pm in Gunnison, CO.  No booze, no drugs.  We saw what out of the corner of our eyes looked like a star growing in size and magnitude very rapidly until it was the relative size equivalence as the moon from our perspective in the crossroads of Denver St. and Ohio St.  After reaching the maximum size and brightness it would grow to, it began to move autonomously through the sky making very abrupt and often jagged maneuvers for a couple of minutes it headed north at an extremely high rate of speed and ultimately disappeared.

Multiple large ufos sighted moving from the southwestern heading northeast..  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-05 20:15:00;9 minutes;Multiple large ufos sighted moving from the southwestern heading northeast Myself, husband and neighbor all saw multiple large ufos flying past Venus in a straight, slightly arched line, equally spaced apart except for a couple. They must be massive as although they werenâ€™t close to being as bright as Venus they were however brighter than nearby visible stars.;38.5536851239668;-106.922734710744
