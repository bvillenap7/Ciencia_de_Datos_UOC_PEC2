The shape was like two ovals intersecting and it pulsated with white yellow and pink light and the light streamed down from the center oval.  I tried to take a picture but only got the window screen.  I watched it for about 2 minutes and then it slowly got smaller and disappeared.  It was really cool.  I definitely think it was a ufo.  It was a large and pulsating light.  I will look at the same time tomorrow morning.  I wish i could email you the shape it was really different.  I drew a picture.  The sky was pitch black and it was close, pulsating and definitely not a planet.;38.5536851239668;-106.922734710744
