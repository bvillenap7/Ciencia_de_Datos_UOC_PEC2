Huge bright light followed us 30 miles!;2009-02-01 04:00:00;30 minutes;Huge bright light followed us 30 miles! My husband and I left Gunnison 4 a.m. to catch flight @ DIA.  Just as we left town E on Hwy 50 we saw a bright white light directly east.  We thought it was a plane, however unusual in middle of night unless emergency.  As we drove light was brighter and closer and followed along with us.  We began to become alarmed as we could not discern what it was!  Finally as we started up Monarch Pass - about 30 miles - it disappeared.;38.5536851239668;-106.922734710744
Large round light came from above in one smooth 3-4 second movement,;2016-07-18 21:00:00;4 seconds;Large round light came from above in one smooth 3-4 second movement, then disappeared.  My husband thought it had a “tail,” but I did not see one.  It was right in front of us while driving westward toward Gunnison after sunset.  We were less than 10 miles from Gunnison.   By “large,” I mean too big to be a shooting star or an airplane light.  I thought it might be a meteor but the “burn out” wasn’t quite right, and the size and shape didn’t really fit either.  Meteor might explain it though--hoping other people saw it.  I guess I would say it was like an oncoming headlight, way up in the sky, coming slowly.  No cars were on the highway with us at the time (we checked,);38.5536851239668;-106.922734710744
