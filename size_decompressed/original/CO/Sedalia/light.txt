As we went further down the road, I realized that there were really two lights, one stacked on top of the other vertically.  One was always brighter than the other, and when one got brighter, the other dimmed.  This happened again and again, but not flashing, more like pulsing, the lights never quite disappearing. I told my husband to pull over so we could have a better look.  About a minute later, I couldn't find it in the sky, and realized it had jumped quite a distance from the west to the east, but I never saw it move.  About three or four minutes later, it was back to where it originally started from. It then suddenly seemed to turn and disappear south.;39.3113;-105.0676
