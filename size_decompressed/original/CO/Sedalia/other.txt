Fast hummingbird UFO possibly? Speed and sounds never heard.;2005-07-01 14:00:00;20 seconds;Fast hummingbird UFO possibly? Speed and sounds never heard. My girlfriend and I were out in the mountains looking for rocks and minerals one sunny afternoon and we decided to take a short rest upon a rock. As we were sitting alone out there and talking there was a lull in the conversation.  Approx. 1 minute into that lull an object flew right next to the left side of my girl's ear and made a loud buzzing growl type sound like we, or i , have never heard.  This was on her blind side and we both heard it and it caused me to look over due to my angel I had a better view than she, however, we both saw this.  As I turned it was flying straight back to the trees and made a 90 degree hair pin left turn like nothing i have ever seen move that way.   I am a country boy from ILLinois who has traveld for 10 years and been in every state and i have never seen nor heard anything like this before.  The closest way to describe this motion was like a giant hummingbird on steroids.  From about 20 yards it was still the size of a baseball.  We heard nothing until it was on the retreat, almost like it went right to my friend to scan or investigate and then hit a thruster to move at such a pace, and then we only saw it for a moment.  If you have any leads or sights for me to investigate I would be very appreciative.  I have been searching for some theory or info and am at a loss. I'm not crazy. I have a need for answers. If you had been there you would be at a loss as well. Im not a fraud or crazy, or into ufo's, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));39.3113;-105.0676
