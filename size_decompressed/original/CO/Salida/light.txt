Bright light with no sound passed above us;2009-07-06 23:00:00;2 minutes;Bright light with no sound passed above us We were laying around a camp fire just northwest of salida when my buddy pointed something up at the sky.When I looked up I saw a bright light which looked like venus during sunset, or sunrise moving across the sky. My first thought is to look for the typical signs of an airplane. Flashing lights, and the typical sounds you hear when a plane is flying overhead. Well none of these were there and as this light passed over us there were three other lights behined this that were i guess you could call it sparkling. Again there was no noise. All of a sudden these lights were gone as soon a they appeared. About a minute later an actual airplane flew over with all signs of an airplain. Strobe lights and the sounds of the engiune. Pretty much confirming what we saw before that was not normal.;38.5265;-105.9954
Lights traveling across sky, disappear suddenly.;2017-10-12 19:10:00;5 minutes;Lights traveling across sky, disappear suddenly. We took our dog out for his evening stroll and saw a bright light moving rapidly across the sky, flying from the WNW toward the ESE.  At first we thought it might be the space station but it was moving very quickly and silently, was in the wrong location and moving in the wrong direction.  Then, it disappeared completely.  There were no clouds in the sky. We continued walking and then noticed another light, just as bright, just as silent, following in the same path across the sky.  We stopped to watch it--and it disappeared at approximately the same place the first one did.  Several high altitude jets went by during the time we were out, and we watched them to ensure that we had seen something different.  The planes had the traditional flashing lights and sound, so we are certain these lights were not planes.;38.5265;-105.9954
I got into my hot tub and when I looked up I saw a string of about 100 bright lights racing across the sky from NW.  ((Starlinks??));2021-02-11 05:51:00;1 minute;At 05:51 I got into my hot tub and when I looked up I saw a string of about 100 bright lights racing across the sky from the northwest to the southeast at about 10 degrees off of vertical. There were no blinking red or white lights. The string was farther east than I could see so I am not sure how many there were total.;38.5265;-105.9954
