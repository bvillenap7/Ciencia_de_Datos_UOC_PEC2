Around 10:30PM on 06/03/13, looking east over our house with Jupiter in view. I spotted an orange object moving approximately south very rapidly it passed just a short distance over Jupiter.  I would compare its apparent speed to that of a low flying jet fighter except it was completely silent.  The object was bigger than a point of light and was not symmetrical it seemed to have a longer dimension perpendicular to the direction of flight.  The object continued south and seemed to curve toward the southeast as it gradually faded from view as it approached the horizon.  I would estimate total time it was in view at around 15 seconds.  My best guess  is that it could have been a meteor passing through the atmosphere more or less parallel to the Earth's surface although it did not leave a vapor trail. What makes me doubt that the object is a fireball is that about 2 or 3 minutes after, I saw a satellite on the same path moving south to north and passing right above Jupiter. Then a couple minutes later, I saw another satellite again on the same path going from north to south and also passing right above Jupiter. That seems like too much coincidence for me to come to terms with.;38.5265;-105.9954
