A star like object stagnant with a sudden light speed movement a little ways away.;2021-01-03 10:00:00;Didn't watch long enough ;A star like object stagnant with a sudden light speed movement a little ways away. It was a cold and windy night, around 10:00, me and my friends were watching TV. Out of the corner of my eye I see out of the window a giant blob in the sky that looked the size of a planet, but had the blinking properties of a star. The more that I looked at that, the more it became a mystery to my mind. Since it was very windy, we thought that maybe it was a few tree branches making it blink that much, so my friend went outside to see if it was the branches. He comes back and reports that it was not the branches and that it was just like that. He starts speculating that it was something different, such as a drone or a satellite. We already ruled out the option of a plane since it was stagnant in the dark moonless sky. Soon after we ruled out a satellite since satellites are orbiting the Earth, and just like the plane’s reason, it wasn’t moving at all. Even more curiously, it just moved faster than my eyes could see to the right. One minute it was in perfec! t view out of the window, then the next you had to be outside to see it. It was still blinking, and had the same properties as it did before. I don’t know why aliens like cows so much, but I have seen stuff on the cow mutilations that take place around where I live, and to make things scarier, cows were/are on the property. I had never put in much thought to aliens, but after that night I have been a firm believer.;38.5265;-105.9954
