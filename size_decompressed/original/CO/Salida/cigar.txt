Two of us were 10 miles east of Salida,CO at a rest area, lying flat on our backs atop a picnic table at a rest area watching the sky. A large object with no blinking lights (moon reflected off it) crossed the sky southwest. As it appeared to be taking it's time & clearly was not a plane, we grabbed video camera & camera with telephoto & doubler lenses... It approached the bend in the big dipper & then dissapeared. 35 mm film yet to be developed , but I got a perfect bead on it in the camera. The video appears to be too dark to see the object. Planes appeared in the area shortly after.;38.5265;-105.9954
