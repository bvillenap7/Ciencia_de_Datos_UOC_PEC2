3 Crafts Above Methodist Mountain in Colorado in August 2004!;2004-08-20 22:00:00;3 hours;3 Crafts Above Methodist Mountain in Colorado in August 2004! Several UFOs entered the area from the north. 3 of the crafts stayed above or beyond Methodist mountain which is on the south-east end of town.  Methodist mountain separates us from the San Luis Valley which is famous for its many sightings. Its possible the crafts could be above the San Luis Valley, but it was hard to judge distance.  The 3 crafts zoomed all around the sky like nothing I've ever seen.  I have been somewhat of a skeptic until that evening. What I saw was absolutely amazing and I could not take my eyes off the crafts.  I continued to watch the entire duration of their presence which was approx. 3 hours.  They seemed to be boomerang shaped or triangular. There are no aircrafts on this planet that could move like that that I'm aware of. After they cruised around for a while, they all 3 took off high up into the heavens headed west and up, up, up until they were no longer visible.  Wow!
