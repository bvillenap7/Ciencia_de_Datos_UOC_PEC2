The light sat just above the mountains.  Initially thought of as the shine of a planet however the light dimmed to a small dot.  It stayed in place then wavered.  After this action it was thought to be a helicopter or a plane.  However, not additional colored flashing lights, like a plane were visible.  After it had dimmed and wavered it had started to shine again.  This shine wasnâ€™t as bright but it was brighter than it was after it dimmed.  Then it disappeared amongst the night sky.;39.8159;-105.4702
