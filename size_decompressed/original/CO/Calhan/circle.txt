REPORT FROM CHUCK ZUKOWSKI, INVESTIGATOR:  Friday night around 7:30pm, I saw a large white circular light heading West to East in;2008-10-03 19:30:00;2 minutes;October 3rd  Diane (last name omitted) report:  Friday night around 7:30pm, I saw a large white circular light heading West to East in the Northern sky. It caught my attention because of it’s brightness. It had a straight path across the sky, no zig zagging, no falling and it did not streak across the sky. It just looked like it was on a straight path. There were no other lights on it and there was no “tail” like a comet. I continued to watch it until it literally faded out. It became almost a translucent grayis/silver color then faded and disappeared. October 6th Monday night about 7:10pm, I was out in the yard with my dogs and I noticed another light. It was a very white light, round and it appeared as if the light were on a craft facing me, however it didn’t appear to be moving in my direction. It was traveling more North to South, and appeared to stop and go, it did this twice but very briefly. I looked at a star that was by the moon for comparison, and it was about the same size. I watched the light for about 2 minutes, then it just got smaller and smaller  and was gone. As it was getting smaller, it did not appear to be going faster. Note: I’m checking satellite positions for this region and time periods. There is a small airport nearby, but no sound was detected. Colorado Springs Airport’s flight path it near the area depending on weather, but the airplanes taking off and landing would be noticeably larger for this area.
