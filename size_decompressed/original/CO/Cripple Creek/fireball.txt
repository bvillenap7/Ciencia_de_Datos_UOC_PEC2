Fireball object in Western Sky;2006-10-01 23:20:00;15 + seconds;Fireball object in Western Sky On the night of 1 Oct. 2006, at approximately 11:20 pm, I was outside on my deck looking in a West/Southwesterly direction when I observed a large fireball type of object traveling from ( approximately ) west to east. As I live in the mountains, away from city lights, I am able to see meteorites very regularly. This object was considerably larger, and slower, than any meteorite that I have seen. It appeared to be burning,as something would entering the atmosphere,with a whitish, and briefly green light as it progressed through its trajectory. Roughly 5 to 10 seconds after it appeared, it seemed to be break up and shed burning pieces of itself,dropping them along its flight path. I was able to observe this object's trajectory until it disappeared from view behind the upper story of my house. I ran to the other end of the deck, but it was no longer visible. At no time did I hear any sound. The object seemed to be at a relatively low altitude ( though it is difficult for me to guess it's altitude with any real accuracy, I would guess it was less than 20,000 feet, and perhaps much lower ) had a very flat trajectory, and did not appear to be descending . My object size estimate relative to the moon, given each objects respective distance to me, would be that the object was 1/15th to 1/20th of the moon size.;38.826;-105.1475
