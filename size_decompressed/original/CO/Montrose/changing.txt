PD));2015-02-08 17:00:00;65 minutes;White Orb, only noticed due to low flying Cessna type plane going same direction Towards east moving slowly to ENE, clear sky, looked like a white donut but without center poked out, then to a spherical shape watched for an hour till faded away, looked more rectangular towards the end.   We used binos and a 9x rifle scope to view, the pictures and video from cell phone just show the white shape.   When first noticed looked as though playing doing flips and such, then settled down.  Color: white then orangeish(believe due to sunsetting). ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses were observing a star or planet.  PD));38.44073006993;-107.893816783217
