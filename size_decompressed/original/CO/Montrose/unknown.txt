Stationary object with three pulsating lights ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD));2004-09-07 00:00:00;20 minutes;Stationary object with three pulsating lights I woke up shortly before 3:00 am. From my bed I have an excellent view of the eastern sky. I noticed a bright, pulsating, stationary light in the sky at a distance of at least 15 miles. I observed for a minute and woke my wife. While she observed I ran down to find my binoculars (10x25 Nikon). I observed the UFO for a minute and then handed the binoculars to my wife. Without any comment from me she described what I had seen three equidistant, white lights, apparently attached to some sort of object. After about 3-4 minutes of observing it moved to the east and remained barely in view for another 10 minutes and then become impossible to view.  This is the third incident in about two months of an anomolous occurance in the same area. The first was bright, stationary object that I thought was a planet. While observing it dimmed completely out and then came back on. Unless I lost my bearings and confused it with a planet it remained there until sunup.  Second sighting was of a very bright object at 9:00 in the same area. Again it appeared stationary as I gauged it to the stationary horizon. Honestly, it looked like it could have been an airplane reflecting the sun just right, but then it dimmed out. It very well could have been an airplane but it must have been moving directly away from me as it appeared stationary.  The third sighting described at the beginning of this report was very distinct in that we could make out something that did appear to have structure.  Anyway, still can't be sure of anything but perhaps this will get some more eyes trained on the area east of Montrose. ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.

Loud humming dark craft passed overhead against a bright cloudy night.;2008-02-24 21:50:00;2 Minutes;Loud humming dark craft passed overhead against a bright cloudy night. I heard an amazing loud humming noise coming from West-southwest. The event grew louder and louder as it approached our house and I jumped out of the Hot tub to see if there was an aircraft that was going to crash nearby. The only thing I could assume was that it was a jet airliner, but it was getting way to loud and way to close. The sound was also somehow wrong and a lower tone than a jumbo jet, and it sounded like an electrical transformer hum, but at a deeper and yet sharper tonality with a bit of a throb to it.  The craft flew nearly over our ranch and was nothing but a dark spot (or lack of cloud reflection) in the sky against the clouds. No lights at all. You could feel the strong humming in the air and my body was vibrating with the noise as it passed heading up towards the hills and on to Gunnison Colorado. Never heard or felt anything like it.;38.44073006993;-107.893816783217
