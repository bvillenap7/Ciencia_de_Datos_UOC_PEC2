solid bright light hovering in sky.;2009-07-01 23:00:00;10 seconds;solid bright light hovering in sky. We were driving home from taking a cruise around town. As we were passing  an elementary school, we encountered a very bright object  due north east  hovering in the sky around 11:05 pm. Me and my friend looked at this object and thought to ourselves that it was just an airplane coming in for a landing but the strange thing was that it was not moving, and there were no flashing lights around it, and it was a solid white light. As we kept driving, a tree passed in front of us which got in the way of the object, and after passing the tree where there were no other trees around, the bright circular object was gone! We both freaked out, and turned around and went back to the same spot where we had seen it, and to our surprise, it was no where to be seen in the sky. No picture was able to be taken due to poor timing.;38.44073006993;-107.893816783217
