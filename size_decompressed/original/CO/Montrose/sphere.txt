One large orange ball crossed the sky above the horizon at apporximately 8:15 on 8-22-16 in Montrose, CO.;2016-08-22 20:15:00;1 minute;One large orange ball crossed the sky above the horizon at apporximately 8:15 on 8-22-16 in Montrose, Co. At approximately 8:15 on Monday Aug 22, 2016,  sitting on my patio looking west a large orange ball went from north to south across the sky just above the horizon above the airport.  It was slow moving and decreased elevation as it traveled until it was out of my line of vision.  It was bright red orange.  I didn't get a picture.  It was just getting dark.  It took a minute or so to pass from my view from right to left which is not the direction of incoming aircraft.  There were trees between it and my patio which blocked the view for part of the passing.  The airport is a couple miles directly west of our house and it looked to be passing over that area.  When it was out of my view it would have bee quite a ways South of the airport area.;38.44073006993;-107.893816783217
