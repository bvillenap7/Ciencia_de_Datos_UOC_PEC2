Two white flashing lights this morning, over Montrose Co.;2019-09-26 05:45:00;15 minutes;Two white flashing lights this morning, over Montrose Co. This morning I extremely bright white light woke me up, (the head of my bed is directly next to a window.)  The light was extremely close to the ground, so I am sure it was not a helicopter.  The light was flashing, and darting, about ten feet every time it flashed.  As it was flashing the object was slowly inclining into the sky, but still darting around about 20 feet every time it flashed at this point.  Then I saw a smaller object appear next to the original larger object.  At this point both flashing lights were quite small.  Then they both darted off.  Shocked and curious, I looked into when satellites were to pass over Montrose, Colorado.  A satellite was secluded to pass over today, but at 7:32pm this evening. This happened at 5:50-6:00am.  It felt like time was lost, so this event could have been longer than this approximate time.  My right hand has a small cut, in between my thumb and index finger.;38.44073006993;-107.893816783217
