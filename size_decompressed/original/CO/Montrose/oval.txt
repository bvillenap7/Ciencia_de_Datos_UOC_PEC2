2 Glowing, super fast moving orbes in the western colorado sky on march 2nd  2013.;2013-03-02 19:00:00;5 minutes;2 Glowing, super fast moving orbes in the western colorado sky on march 2nd  2013. On march 2nd 2013 at about 7:00 pm i stepped outside to have a smoke, it was then that i looked ahead into the south western sky and whitnessed two glowing orbes.  These orbes were orene in color, flying real close to each other and just acting verry strage to be just some regular air craft.   I live near an air port and have seen enough stuff in the sky. the air port is about 10 miles in the opposite direction of where these crafts were spotted. one of these cradts shot straight up in the sky at a rate of speed that I have never whitnesses before it was out of my visual view in a matter of 1 or 2 seconds. The other craft stayed around a bit longer and continued heading north. This 2nd craft also took of faster than any thing i had ever seen. I could not hear any sound comming from ither of these crafts and they were a solid illuminated color. They were illuminated orange, there were no flashing lights they were lit up solid. I have video evidence of this sight! ing that I would like to share with any body who is interested in seeing this compelling video i just need to send it in the form of a video txt messege.;38.44073006993;-107.893816783217
Orange and red oval shaped lights seen by to in Western Colorado!!!!!;2013-03-02 19:00:00;5 minutes;orange and red oval shaped lights seen by to in Western Colorado!!!!! I stepped outside to have a smoke and no sooner after i did that i whitnessed to oval objects flying verry close to each other. at first they appeared to be side by side and moving slowley. shortley after i spotted them they began to seperate. Both objests were at first headed north. Suddenly one of the objects began to climb in elevation it headed straight up (and I mean straight up) verry verry fast it was out of my eye sight in  a matter of moments. the other craft continued heading north also this craft was at first traveling slowley than it just sped up and accelerated verry verry vast and was out of sight in a matter of moments, how ever it did  ot head up into the sky like the other one it just continued heading north. What compelled me to report this was the fact that these crafts did not move like a hellacopter or plane they were way faster, and hellacopters and planes dont just go straight up like that. Also they were jot illuminated like a hellacopter or air plane there were no flashing lights they were a solid red and orange color there no flashing lights at all just a solid ball object in the nights sky.  Also they did not make any noise they were silent and i believe they were low enough in altitude that I should have been able to hear some sort of sound comming from them.  The weather conditions were great it was a clear nite in colorado, my mother also whitnessed these lights in the sky. i've seen lots of air craft in the sky as I live near an airport (about 1.5 miles away but in the opposite direction of where these lights were originally spotted) so I feel like i've seen enough air craft in the nights sky to say with out a showdow of a doubs that these particullar air craft were j! ust DIFFERENT and verry out of the norm.  Air craft do not jenerally fly super close to each other, they make sound of some sort, and they are not usually light up in a solic color, normally they have flashing lights and that is clearly evident in the video footage that I have.  im not teck save so i need to sent this video to some body in the form of a text message video.  YOU NEED TO SEE THIS IT IS CAPTIVATING!!!!!;38.44073006993;-107.893816783217
Round, peach-colored object heading wsw.;2014-03-24 19:47:00;4 seconds;Round peach colored object heading wsw I went outside to put the dog out and observed a beautiful clear star filled co. sky.  I observed one jet aircraft heading west to east.   I looked to the north about 80 degrees up and noticed an object traveling east north east to west north west that was round in shape and peach colored.  It headed to a tree which I ran around to try to observe better and on the other side a jet appeared.  The jet was high in elevation, about the same as the other object.  The jet had its light flashing and the other object had no flashing lights.   I didn't see the other object again but its diameter was larger than the jet.  It may have been shadowing it.  I would guess their elevation over 20 thousand feet as ours is 5890.  There were no flashing lights on the unknown object.;38.44073006993;-107.893816783217
