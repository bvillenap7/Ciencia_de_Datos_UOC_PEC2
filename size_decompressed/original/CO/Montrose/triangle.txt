Black triangle craft.;2020-05-15 22:06:00;5 minutes;Clear, no moon, unlimited visibility, no street or house lights, very rural area. While outside I observed a black triangle craft slowly moving from southwest to northeast directly over my house. The craft made no sound, no engine sound, no contrails or exhaust observed. Estimated from 500 to 800 feet above me, about the size of a small house, moving very slowly. Craft had a series of white lights on sides and stern, which was a rounded concave shape. No reflections of any kind seen, the white lights were quite brilliant but didn't reflect off the craft itself or light up the ground. Craft appeared very smooth with no detail or markings seen. The black color is hard to describe, it was VERY black. Observed for about 5 minutes. I've seen military aircraft in similar shapes, and there is a small airport a few miles east of me. This was not a typical aircraft, there were no typical red green running lights, no strobe lights, and no engine sound. I am a retired ! police officer, trained to observe. This sighting has really disturbed me.;38.44073006993;-107.893816783217
