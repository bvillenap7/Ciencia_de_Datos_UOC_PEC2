Rectangular silver object at the town pool.;2014-05-28 15:15:00;30 seconds;Rectangular silver object at the town pool. My girlfriend and I were at the town's pool swimming laps and playing.   At 3:15 PM I looked up and saw an object with a silver rectangular structure with a pair of short stout  brownish appendages that ran the full length of the rectangle's sides.  Within the rectangle were two symmetrical dark gray circular disks. The object had no sound.  It did move in a normal flight pattern.  Nothing odd here.   It flew to the south and curves southeast out of my sight. My girlfriend wears glasses, however not in the pool.  The object was large enough for me to track but she couldn't see anything.   I am not sure how high the object was, thus I am not sure of its size. I hope I wasn't the only one at the pool to see it.   There were 250 to 300 people there, roughly.;40.4836333333333;-104.899431884058
Rectangular object seen during the day.;2015-10-15 14:00:00;45 seconds;Rectangular object seen during the day. It was early afternoon, I was driving southbound on county road 13, approximately 1/2 mile south of Hwy 392.  I looked up to the NW and saw a large rectangular object moving very slowly to the the north.  It was at cloud level.  The edges were well illuminated but the entire center had a milky almost transparent color.  The object turned west and instantly disappeared.  I had pulled over to the east side of the road on the shoulder.   I was a bit dazed, but on the west side of the road was a small 4 door sedan with a woman, about 45 years old in the driver's seat and a young teen in the passenger seat.  They had pulled over, and were stairing up at the same location.  They had a similar stunned look on their faces. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
