Upside Down Black Metalic Pyramid with non-defracting lights;1982-02-12 23:54:00;6 Minutes;Upside Down Black Metalic Pyramid with non-defracting lights Coming home from work, I saw 3 non-defracting white light beams streaming over tree tops and creating distinct round lighted areas on the hillside. As I approached town, I noticed that these lights were coming from the grocery store parking lot area. It was a stationary object so even though it was about 2 miles to town it was still there when I arrived. I saw a dark triangle shape against the sky with the 3 lights coming from each side of the point witch was pointed towards the ground. I was curious, still thinking that this could be a hot air balloon or something else. I was the only car which turned into the parking lot. I thought this in itself was amazing since the road had alot of traffic that night. Was I the only one who saw this?. I pulled my car directly under the craft, which was only slightly above the parking lot light. It was a dark color maybe black, metalic with slight bumps arranged in possible adhesion or rivet type patterns. The shape was clearly up-side down pyramidal and about 50-60 feet from top corner to top corner. It was centered over 4 parking lot lights and I wondered if it was gathering energy from them also. It made no sound.(I turned off my car, and listened carefully between the waves of cars on the road). Another car pulled up, a grey Toyota Celica with 2 young men inside. they roled down their window and were looking at the craft with the biggest eyes I've ever seen. Their mouths were hanging open and I could see their tongues. I waved at them and the craft began to rotate on axis. The men burned rubber out of there and squealed tires again acelerating onto the road. I decided that my car was a safer vantage point at this time and hoped it would start. It did and I backed up about 50ft. The craft then headed towards the grocery store. It looked like it would run into the sign and roof. When the point of the craft got within 15-20 ft of the store, the craft lifted about 5 foot and cleared the store top. I should metion that it didn't make any sound, the lights had rotate! d from p ointing west to pointing south and it was only traviling at a speed of about 5MPH. Against the night sky I could see the flat top clearly. A few months later a co-worker was talking about the UFO that crossed the road in front of her. She said that she and others stopped their vehicles on highway 34 towards Greeley and just watched this up-side down pyamid thing cross the road. She said that it was still moving at about 5MPH. Her sighting lasted about 15-20minutes as she saw the lights before it crossed the road. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not specify whether the time was am or pm, but we presume it was a nighttime sighting.  We have amended the time.  The date may be approximate, although we are not certain of that.  We would welcome reports from other witnesses.  PD));40.4836333333333;-104.899431884058
Black triangle with three lights over Windsor;2001-11-18 01:00:00;5 seconds;Black triangle with three lights over Windsor My wife in I were sitting in our hot tub watching the Leonid meteor shower when all of the sudden we both noticed flying directly above us three orangish/yellowish lights moving in a northern direction.  The lights were round and were arranged in each corner of what seemed to be a perfect triangle.  The rest of the object was black.  It was moving at a very fast rate of speed and completely silent.  I'd also appeared to be flying at a very low altitude. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports of an object, or objects, allegedly witnessed during the dramatic Leonid meteor shower of 2001, which do not appear compatible with traditional meteoric events.  Please see other reports.  PD));40.4836333333333;-104.899431884058
Black triangle with three lights seen flying over Windsor, Colorado.;2004-09-25 01:30:00;30 seconds;Black triangle with three lights seen flying over Windsor, Colorado. My wife and I were sitting in our hot tub late Saturday night.  The hot tub jets were turned off so there was very little noise around us at the time.  I looked up at the stars and all of the sudden I saw a black, triangle shaped craft moving almost directly over our house.  I clutched onto my wife's arm and when she looked up she knew she was seeing exactly the same craft that we had witnessed just 3 years ago from the exact same spot.  As it flew over us, it appeared to veer slightly to the left and then continued flying in a north-eastern direction.  It was black with round lights in each of the three corners and completely silent.  This is the second time we've seen this aircraft flying over our house.  The first time we saw it was during the Leonid meteor showers.  It's almost like it wants to be seen.;40.4836333333333;-104.899431884058
