Splitting light;2011-09-08 22:45:00;1-2 min.;Splitting light I was walking my dog around 22:45. I got to the end of the alley and was looking up, I saw a bright round white light heading east/south east traveling in an arc.  No running lights what so ever. As I watched the white light split into 3 amber lights in a triangular formation, no flashing, just steady amber lights. Then it seemed to disappear. There was a small airplane a few minutes later traveling the same path about the same height in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
