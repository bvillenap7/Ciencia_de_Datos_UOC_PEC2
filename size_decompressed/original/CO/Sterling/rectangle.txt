Small, silent, glowing probe above house;2000-03-01 19:00:00;20 seconds;Small, silent, glowing probe above house I was in the alley in back of my house taking out the trash.  When i came back and approached the back gate I looked up and floating above my house about 30ft. away from me was this small cylinder type craft.  It was probably only 2ft. long and 10 inches wide.  It was glowing with green lights and it floated completed silently moving down the length of my house.  It flew slowly just above the power lines, right over my head and into the neighbors yard. I then watched it disappear in the moonlight because it was a full moon that night.  It never changed altitude or speed.  My only guess is that it was some sort of probe.  I'm reporting this in hopes that someone else has witnessed this strange little craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));40.6306;-103.2212
