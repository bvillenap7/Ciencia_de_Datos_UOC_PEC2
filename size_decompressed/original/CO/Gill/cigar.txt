2 or 3 lights found over the horizon- there and then gone.;2015-12-27 23:05:00;1 minute;2 or 3 lights found over the horizon- there and then gone. I was letting my dog out and I noticed the craft far off near the horizon but higher than most lights would be (and there isn't a lot of lights).  There was 2 or three lights.  I looked away and it got much closer to me, at least 200-300 feet. I went inside and it remained in roughly the same area for half a minute or so and then I looked away and it was gone completely, nowhere at all.  I am in a very small town, and there is nowhere for a helicopter to take off or land. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
