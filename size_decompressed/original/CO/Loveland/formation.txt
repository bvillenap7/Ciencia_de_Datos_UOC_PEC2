3 object formation over Loveland, CO;2006-07-28 04:40:00;1 minute;3 object formation over Loveland, CO I had gone outside in SE Loveland, about 2.5 miles west of I-25 and the 402 exit, just after 4 AM on 7/28/06 to watch the Aquarid meteor shower. The night was clear and cloudless with just the barest hint of approaching dawn on the eastern horizon, and an occasional airliner or 2 from Denver International Airport was visible far to the SE. After spotting 1 or 2 unremarkable meteor trails in the southern sky within half an hour, I was about to go back inside when I noticed a formation of 3 faint unblinking starlike objects in a triangle formation in the mid southern sky moving N/NE at about airliner speed. It was positioned backwards as it were, with the point of the triangle in the rear of the direction it was travelling. It also was a longer distance from the front two objects to the rear, giving the appearance of a long thin triangle.  Size was unknown but my extended thumbnail at arms length would just fit in each point of the group. Other stars could be seen behind the objects as they travelled so it didn't appear to be a single object. When the formation was almost directly overhead I noticed another starlike object, somewhat brighter, that was travelling to the south and which crossed the formation's path, although I don't know if the objects had any relation to each other and I kept my attention on the formation as the other object passed by. No noise was heard nor any other effects from the objects. After watching for approx. 1 minute the objects began to fade and I lost sight of them about midway into the northern sky. It almost seems like they stopped in the sky but due to their faintness that's only speculation. Further scanning of the sky revealed no more objects or meteors and the sky was beginning to brighten towards dawn.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
3 circular object formation or triangle over Loveland, CO;2007-09-30 21:45:00;10 seconds;3 circular object formation or triangle over Loveland, CO Scanning the sky as I often do, I was setting out my trash bin on Sunday Sept 30, 9:45 p.m.  I noticed a satellite and 2 or 3 commercial aircraft on approach to Denver International Airport while I watched the sky.  As I was about to go in I spent another minute or 2 to look up, and noticed 3 dimly lit circular objects speeding from south to north almost directly overhead.  They were either a tight formation or a single object with 3 lights.  There was no noise. They may have been illuminated from city glow as they looked a faded brownish color. Each object or light had a hazy glow around the edge.  With my stuck out thumb as a guide the object(s) together were about as big as a quarter at arm's length.  I had both a camera and camcorder 2 feet away from me in my car but the whole sighting lasted less than 10 seconds and by the time I could have gotten them out and turned on the objects would have been gone. I opted to watch.  After watching them cross the sky and disappear past the roof of my house I watched a few more minutes to see if anything else would show up, then I went inside and started typing this.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765

After 5 minutes went by, one single red light was already past our house and near my mother's house!  She lives east of us I was in her pasture and it was like a stop light flying right at me!!  My husband has video footage of the event but won't share it with me.  The light I saw was so bright and it didn't make a sound.  It flew left, then right, and then proceed to fly toward me and then slowly went out.  I tried to get video of it, but my phone couldn't catch it;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
