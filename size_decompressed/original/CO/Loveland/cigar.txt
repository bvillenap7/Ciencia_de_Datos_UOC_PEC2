Cigar Shaped Lighted Object;1989-07-05 23:30:00;1 minute;Cigar Shaped Lighted Object We were building a house in the Buckhorn Canyon 25 miles West of Ft. Collins, Co on County Road 44H.  We had started on our footers and we were sleeping in our camp trailor which had a large back window next to the bed. It was 23:30 and I saw  an object coming from the South.  I told my wife to look at it.  It was moving about 25 to 30 mph.  It was long and lit up.  It almost looked like it had 5' x 8' windows. It went North not making a sound (No noise at all). It was about 100' over the mountain.  Later on we joked about it, calling it a flying mobile home.  It was a half mile off a seldom used dirt road back on a mountain.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765

I just got out of my friends truck to go inside my house about 10pm.  Then as i was walking up to my door then a comit like object (like a missle) with a bright gold jet trail flew above me about 1000 yards.  It was flying in a completely straight line.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
