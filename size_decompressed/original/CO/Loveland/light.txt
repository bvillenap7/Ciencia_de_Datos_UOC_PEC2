It changed color an;1995-03-27 21:15:00;45 min;Summary : It looked like a star that was moving across the night sky.  But it stopped and changed direction again and again.  It changed color and became up to 5 separate lights always moving closer to us.  Near the end we could see spotlights from the craft(s).  It disapeared straight up so fast it could not have been man made. We were all camping, and sober.  It was green at first and when it was clear it was not a star or satalite it changed into up to 5 lights.  They were all changing colors sometimes when forming shapes.  Squares with the bottm red and top green.  Then a diamond all blue then white.  We watched for 25 min. then our vision was blocked by a rock face.  We all discussed what we saw and decided if we climbed on top of this rock and we were able to see it again it was certainly not our imaginations.  we viewed it again from on top of this rock face for 20 min more.  We could now see spot lights coming from it- them...  It continued to change the shapes it was forming and color of the lights that were visable. The spotlights were changing color too.  It went back to a single light, brighter than it was befoe.  Then it changed in to 3 then 5 then 9 lights forming a hoop of white lights only.  No other colors just white.  It accelerated to the west and upward so fast that the hoop i! mprint of light was visable for atleast a full second after it was gone.  If it was man made I would like to meet the men who built it-them.  We were all pretty quiet for the last min or so just watching, but when it flashed away that fast all of us screamed at the same time in aknowledgemnet.  Witnesses I am sure ((Name deleted)) of Ft.

triangle, lights, front range, co, summer 05;2005-07-17 23:00:00;1.5-2min;triangle, lights, front range, co, summer 05 This was another very similar sighting I had in Arizona, but in a different place Loveland co. It occurred July 17 05 very much in coincidence to the fact that I was talking about what I seen in Phoenix.  This night I was not alone my sister her boyfriend and their friend, they had all seen this to but they don’t remember or care as much as me.  I started to talk about these lights I'd seen, and they were actually interested. This conversation continued and I remember saying I think its just a matter of looking up at the nights sky once in a while and I was looking.About an hour had passed the conversation had changed. I had this feeling or intuition to look and I looked straight at the same three lights. I stood up and yelled  that’s them and sure enough I wasn’t crazy because they all seen them.  We watch the 3 lights move together in a triangle. I said lets see if they cross over a star I wonted see if it blacked out the star when the triangle covered it. We followed them to not see them do so when I said  I hope they do something different. And sure enough the did before I could finish saying it.  I remember the front light shut off(disappeared) then a second and the third in a 123 type of rhythm. I was like Woh that’s different, but they were gone.  My friend spotted them again as they reappeared where they started. to do the same triangle thing traveling in the same direction at the same speed. But they didn’t move as far because the triangle stopped moving forward and then in a manor where it flipped and turned and didn’t look like a triangle anymore. we could  tell that this wasn’t a solid vehicle but three individual  lights.  This all was happening very fast and continued to do so. the three lights moved closer to each other to only to go into a chase that was all mathematically perfect. they chased each other in a perfect circle so fast and so tight to form a perfect bright white ring. then they split into three directions in perfect angles from each other and then disappeared after a very short distance, to not be seen again.  we all went nuts and climbed on to the roof of our trailer house. we were all being very loud and hopeful we'd see them again. but we didn’t and I haven’t again yet. I remember my mom getting pissed about all the noise. I am certain this wasn’t a manned vehicle maybe controlled remotely (robotically).  But again the vibes I got makes me certain that it was not man made. I felt like it was trying to communicate but I really don’t know. I just know I’m a believer. I’m not lying. I never do. But know one believes tell they see it for them selves. just look up at the stars once in a while an think about it.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Flashing light with no running lights inbetween flashes over NE Colorado;2005-08-06 23:00:00;30 seconds;Flashing light with no running lights inbetween flashes over NE Colorado While stargazing last night (8/6/05) approximately 10:55 MT, a lady friend with me pointed out a white flashing light in the NE sky travelling to the north.  The light flashed once like a bright aircraft light but after the initial flash there were no visible running lights like a conventional aircraft.  About 10 seconds later the light flashed again in an apparent northward movement, and repeated once more about 10 seconds later further north again.  There were no lights or shapes visible inbetween flashes. It was then obstructed from view in the distance by trees and buildings. The light appeared bright and close enough that normal aircraft running lights would have been easily visible inbetween the long delay between flashes.  Also the light first appeared in the NE section of the sky, it was not visible coming from the south. We had been skygazing continuously for approximately the past 20-30 minutes prior to the sighting, were actually looking up when the first flash occurred, and would have seen the light if it had been approaching from the south. The only other events of note were that we did notice 3 or 4 meteor streaks spaced out over the time we were gazing, and the only possible way for me to explain the light conventionally might be a small meteor travelling too slow to create a visible streak but fast enough for some material to have heated during reentry and ignited intermittently.  (Note to NUFORC personnel: I've submitted a number of reports over the past few years and mentioned this to the NUFORC hotline, which I called just before entering this report.  I realize one can go for years or never at all without seeing a ufo, and receiving yet another report from me might create suspicion, but for the record I maintain that all I do is look up, and that these are all legitimate reports that describe events that are just not conventional enough for me to dismiss as such.);40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
eight bright red-orange lights in formation at night traveled from northwest to southeast over my house and disappeared instantly;2008-04-27 20:45:00;13  minutes;eight bright red-orange lights in formation at night traveled from northwest to southeast over my house and disappeared instantly At approximately 8:45 pm on Sunday, April 27, 2008, I went outside  through my open garage door. I had just returned from my job - I work in retail - I looked up at the sky because it was very clear and dark and I thought I would see some stars.  Straight ahead of me- due east, were two bright red-orange lights just hanging suspended in the sky above and in front of me.  I thought they might be a reflection on my eyeglasses, so I removed them.  I was totally shocked and surprised by what I was seeing.  I put my glasses back on - the lights remained the same.  I could not make out a distinct shape because it was dark and the light was so bright.  They started to move very slowly and silently toward the southwest.  Two more sets of lights, identical in every way, joined the first set.  They took a position directly under the first set of lights.  Then a third set of lights did the exact same thing.  There were six sets of identical lights arranged in pairs- each under the other.  They all moved slowly and silently - there was no noise whatsoever - toward the southeast.  I went in the house to get a family member to see what I was seeing - we were both mesmerized by the lights and their intensity and their slow, silent movement through the sky.  I looked over to the North and saw one more light (I was up on a hill) which I thought, at first, was just something that was being launched, like a flare.  It was a single light that moved (glided) very quickly right next to the last set of lights. I kept trying to identify by some logic what the lights might be: hot air balloons, flares, etc, but nothing fit what I was seeing.  The lights continued to glide away toward the southeast and just immediately disappeared - they did not fade away - they just disappeared as if their lights went out.  The total duration was about 13 minutes.  The second witness is an older person- quite skeptical, and could not believe what was being seen either.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Light seen near Colorado air port;2011-05-02 21:56:00;Driving;Light seen near Colorado air port I live near an airport in Colorado and very used to seeing helicopters and air plains.   Last night however I saw something I cannot explain.  To the east of 1-25 I saw a bright white light! It caught my eye because it was brighter then all other lights in the sky or on the ground.  I watched this light shrink, change colors and then move sporadically across the sky, it then vanished.   I have never been one to jump to conclusions, and am not claiming anything, but I saw something in the sky over northern Colorado.

Light in North Eastern sky;2012-06-21 21:50:00;5 minutes;Light in North Eastern sky I was looking back porch sliding window at around 9:50 pm when I notice a bright white light in the North East sky. I watch it move from North East to South East.  I took around 5 minutes and then disappeared in the South East sky.  I made no sound and was much brighter than the stars. I moved much quicker than an airliner as I’ve seen these across the sky almost every night.  The white light may have been a satellite?  The satellites that I’ve noticed in the past seem to move similar to this but are not as bright as this one.

Bright lights multiplying;2015-02-05 19:30:00;5 minutes;Bright lights multiplying There were 3 bright lights not moving out east of town.  We started driving towards them. The first one stayed in bright and in place while the others dimmed and moved towards the south then stopped.  Then a fourth bright light appeared next to the first one.  It dimmed and moved away towards the south and stopped near the other two.  We stopped the car and just watched.  Out of no where a fifth bright light appeared next to the first one and again it dimmed and moved to the south towards the others.  Then the first bright light died dimmed out and they all disappeared.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Multiple colored lights west of Loveland.;2018-01-07 18:00:00;45 minutes;Multiple colored lights west of Loveland. First my son and boyfriend noticed a green light in the sky above us and slightly west and a light yellow larger orb shaped light directly above.  They yelled into the camper and I came out and saw them also.  We pointed them out to a neighbor who then watched them with us.  My boyfriend went to his mother's camper and had her come out and look also.  The lights moved and changed directions a few times.  We watched for about 5 mins then 2 helicopters flew towards the lights at which time the orb stopped moving then proceeded north west and the green light headed west.  When the lights were too dim to see clearly, I was headed back into the house when my son yelled at me to look because there were more lights.  When I looked to the West I saw two hot pink very bright lights with a green light in the center lined up perfectly spaced vertically coming over the mountain straight towards us. We then yelled at the neighbor and my boyfriend to look and I knocked on my ! other neighbor's door and had him and his girlfriend come out and look at the lights as they were so shocking amd unusual.  The two pink and green light moved in a strange manner, shifting position and changing direction quickly moving towards us but always keeping in a triangular pattern with the green in the center. Just to the east  of the pink and green lights was a smaller  red light we noticed at one point that was harder to see and it did not follow the pink and green lights as they traveled so we lost track of it. We saw what we identified as a plane come across the sky from the West towards the formation at which time the green and pinklights paused then moved off to the northwest, shifting an appearing to get farther apart but still equally distanced and triangular in nature.  At least one other neighbor at the campground came outside and witnessed these lights while we were out there. He was on the phone at the time and told the person on the phone about the light! s. We saw the lights move off into the distance until they wer! e so fai nt we could not see them any longer. Then above us and to the west we noticed a bright blue light which came towards us and appeared to come lower then moved north west and higher until out was also out of sight. We stayed outside for about 10 mins after that and saw no further strange lights but an incredible amount of air traffic flying much lower than usual which we also found strange. All of the strange lights we witnessed stayed solid and did not flash or change color. One neighbor tried to record and photograph but the lights did not show up on his phone camera. My son tried to photograph the lights but they did not show up for him either. I did not try to photograph it myself because I did not want to break away from viewing to go in the house and get my phone.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
String of lights equidistant in western sky that followed each other.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-03-05 19:30:00;18 minutes;String of lights equidistant in western sky that followed each other. At approx. 19:30 lights started appearing in the western sky, just to the left of Venus.  The lights traveled NE, and approximately every 5 seconds a new light appeared from the same spot, and followed the other lights, until they disappeared in the sky one after the other, all in the same spot.  The stream of lights lasted until 19:48.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
7-8 white circular shapes moving in uniform, at same speed across the sky for 2-3 min before disappearing. ((Spacelink satellites??));2020-03-05 19:45:00;2-3 minutes;Loveland, CO 7-8 white circular shapes moving in uniform, at night, at same speed across the sky for 2-3 min before disappearing. I was looking at, what I soon after found out was Venus, in the sky as it clearly stood out in the sky as a bright white light.  Above the light was what I assumed were 3 to 4 stars above the light evenly spread out, but as I was looking I noticed the dimmer circular lights moving.  They were moving left to right.  As I was observing they all stayed in a line and all moved at the same pace.  As they got to a certain point in the sky they changed direction and went upward.  Shortly after going upward they quickly disappeared.  The circular lights started to show just left of Venus before moving right across the sky.  I noticed 7 or 8 of them before the last one started, where they all did, and they all disappeared in the same spot after moving upward, which from my vantage point was about an inch when direction changed. I have no explanation to what I saw and I am not a regular star gazer, but at my age I've looked at stars, constellations, and planets many o! f nights, and have never in my life seen anything move.  So I know it wasn't a star, planet, or constellation, as they sit in the sky and don't move.  I have no answers to what I saw, but it's like nothing I have ever come close to wittnesing before.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Multiple small white lights swooping and changing direction.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-05 20:00:00;30 minutes;Multiple small white lights swooping and changing direction. 20 or so small lights like satellites. Swooping and changing direction though with no apparent pattern. Moderate speed, not super fast or slow. Two small planes up there obviously flying lower as lights disappeared behind the planes. Quite dark so not able to see shapes. Same color as satellites just tiny white lights. Eventually they seemed to decide to all head towards the NE and disappeared into the clouds.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Stream of perfectly spaced light objects;2020-12-02 19:00:00;3 minutes;Stream of perfectly spaced light objects We just witnessed a string of perfectly spaced lights traveling together for at least a few minutes.  Long enough for us to stare and repeatedly ask ourselves what we were seeing.  Estimated total was between 30 to 50 objects.  At first I thought they were coming from the ground and exiting the atmosphere but I now believe what we were seeing was them crossing or skimming the upper atmosphere.  They seemed to appear from no where on the horizon, would then get very bright as they entered the middle of the stream, and then fade out.  All while maintaining perfect spacing and formation.  The stream of bright objects flowed for an estimated two to three minutes nonstop.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
