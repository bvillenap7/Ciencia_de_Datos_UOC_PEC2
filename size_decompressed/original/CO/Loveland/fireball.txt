On April 27th 2008 at about 8:40 we were standing on our driveway on S. Arthur Ave in Loveland CO. We saw 6 round orange yelllow lights in the sky, like the color of fire (fireballs). There was no sound. The lights were in formation, two followed by two followed by two, the same distance apart from each other side to side front to back. They were moving from the Northwest to the Southeast at a pretty good speed. When we first saw them they were at about 60 degrees elevation (about 11 o’clock looking east) and then when they were about at a 30 degree elevation (about 2 o’clock looking east) a seventh came from the Northwest traveling at a faster rate of speed (this is when we remembered the camera and took the pictures) it cought up with the others and joined the formation. And then they were gone. The entire time we watched them was 10 to 15 minutes;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
