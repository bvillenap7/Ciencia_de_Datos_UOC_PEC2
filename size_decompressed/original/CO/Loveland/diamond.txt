Stationary white starburst light sighted over the Colorado eastern skies at 0515 until 0540.;2007-10-09 05:50:00;:30 minutes;Stationary white starburst light sighted over the Colorado eastern skies at 0515 until 0540. I hesitate to term it a UFO, but I saw this light continuously for about 30 minutes while on my morning walk between 0515 and 0540. It was a stationary light in the eastern sky that looked like a star that would be drawn by an artist. If I held a ruler in front of my extended arms, I would guess about 1/2 from side to side, which were the longest rays. To the top and sides were more and shorter rays. The bottom of the item seemed to be reflecting the light, which would suggest the morning sun rising in the east. However, the object was completely stationary and it is still dark out at 0610.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
