At first I thought it was commercial aircraft, but I soon realized that it was not because it was a single orb of orange/yellow light that pulsated and remained stationary.  I knew it wasn't a copter because copters have more than one light and they don't pulsate. I continued looking at this thing and soon approached it, but it still did not move and continued to pulsate.  This event probably occurred in about 5 minutes time since I was traveling at about 40 mph. I continued to look back after I passed it, and it continued its strange behavior.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765

It was above the horizon, but not as high up as an airplane.  In an instant, it disappeared.  There were many reports of this sighting that night, all the way from Denver to Nebraska, Wyoming and SDakota.  I have confirmed it with at least 7 others that saw it also, all in various locations in Larimer county.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Slow moving and silent a bright red orange color that was one ring of lights with no lights in the center.;2001-07-15 01:50:00;60 sec.;Slow moving and silent a bright red orange color that was one ring of lights with no lights in the center. It was a ring of light a bright red orange.  Reminded me of an old flourescent kitchen light.  It was not a series of individual lights.  It was dark in the center. Because of the angle I could see it was a ring shape.  Saw the light through the trees, then the shape when it came through a section with no branches. I saw this through my second story bedroom window. We live in the country so there are not alot of lights surrounding us. It could not have been too high.  We live not too far from the airport, so I see lots of planes coming and going.  That is not what I saw this morning. It Moved slowly, and silently I am college educated, never seen anything like this before.  Never gave it much thought. Just stared at it with disbelief.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Seven  round,bright orange lights seen, spaced  evenly apart, moving in perfect unison without any sound.;2008-04-27 20:30:00;5min;Seven  round,bright orange lights seen, spaced  evenly apart, moving in perfect unison without any sound. Sunday April 27,08 at 20:30 me, my husband,son and daughter were getting out of our car to go into our home when my husband looked up and saw these bright orange lights in the sky.  They were circular in shape, bright orange, and moving  from the west to south east in perfect unison.  They were seen in 2's appearing to be gliding in perfect unison and spaced perfectly apart from ea. other.  We saw two lights, then two more and then two more with a single light coming up at the tail.  There was absolutely no sound, or noise of any kind.  No trail of smoke or exhaust was seen. I have never seen anything like this before. We watched them for approximately 5 min. and then they were suddenly gone without a trace.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Orange/Pink orb moving at high rate of speed over Loveland/Fort-Collins heading north to Wyoming.;2014-12-09 17:15:00;15 minutes;Orange/Pink orb moving at high rate of speed over Loveland/Fort-Collins heading north to Wyoming. I had just turned north off of Foxtail Dr. onto Rocky Mountain ave. in Loveland's Centerra Shopping area, when I saw a bright orange dot, initially solid in color, appear from the top of my jeep's windshield and begin heading north.   At first I thought it was a plane landing at Fort-Collins/Loveland airport but then quickly realized it was moving far too fast to be landing.  My next assumption was that it was meteor falling from the sky.  However when it didn't dissipate, as most meteorites do, I realized I must be looking at something very special.   As I looked closer I noticed that it was an almost semi-opaque but well defined circle... or orb as you people call them.  As I looked, the object very clearly changed color to a pinkish color for a few seconds and then changed back to orange.  It did this a few times as it flew north but because it was moving at such a high rate of speed, I only saw it change color 4 or 5 times.   It was traveling south to north, paralleling I-25 on its west side, appearing to head to Wyoming.  I watched it almost disappear into the northern horizon, to the point where you could barely see it.  It looked like a faint star very low on the horizon, maybe 5 degrees.   I was having a hard time seeing it at this point, so I pulled over and on the frontage road and watched it on the horizon.  It didn't move for a long time and just looked like a faint orange star.  It stayed there for maybe 8 or 9 minutes, at which point it went straight up and disappeared.   I have never seen anything like this and have never believed in this sort of thing until now.   I have been unable to sleep tonight because of it and decided I would report it.   There was no sound and given how low it was initially and how fast it was going I would have assumed you would have heard a sonic boom or something.  I have never seen anything move that fast!;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
I look east.  There are 3 vertical stars, that I use to see the craft.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of stars??  PD));2018-01-16 21:00:00;Continuous;I live between Loveland and Berthoud on Highway 287.  I look east.  There are 3 vertical stars, that I use to see the craft.  It is to their right.  It hovers higher than aircraft, and becomes one, still light when a jet passes below.  It moves in all directions, within a small area.  It goes from one to several lights.  When it is lit up, the lights follow a curve, like along a circle.  The lights dim and get very bright.  They have smaller, colored lights that flash once and awhile, on the bottom.  I've seen blue, green, and red.  I have observed them for a week now, and they are always there! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the three stars the witness alludes to may be the three stars that form the belt in the Orion Constellation.  Possible sighting of stars??  PD));40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
White round disk with dark markings and lights seen high over Northern Colorado;2018-07-29 20:00:00;20 minutes;White round disk with dark markings and lights seen high over Northern Colorado A little after 8 PM, I looked up at the sky from my backyard and saw a tiny round white object high overhead, looking like a little moon with dark markings I could not make out.   I grabbed my binoculars for a better look (7x50) and still had difficulty seeing what it was, but it appeared that the dark markings were squared off, and the object had a circle of tiny lights.   I went to the garage to get out my small telescope, but the object by this time was coming in and out of clouds, however, I could see that it was moving eastward, from high overhead toward the eastern horizon.  The sky was still very light.  Now (8:40 PM MDT) clouds have obscured the sky, but I have no idea what this object was.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
