Oval ufo speeding SE to NW;2003-11-04 23:15:00;1 minute;Oval ufo speeding SE to NW About 11:15 p.m. (Checked my watch when I saw it) I was letting my dog out before turning in for the night.  I was standing facing due north but staring straight up watching the stars as I waited for the dog. Out of the corner of me eye I noticed an object speeding (faster than any jet) from the southeast to the northwest in a straight line.  It was oval shaped, about the size of a pea held at arms length.  It was not brightly lit like a star, but had a dim glow, sort of close to what a flourescent light looks like at half strength before it flickers completely on.  The color was brownish red. I almost thought it may have been a balloon, but the speed it was travelling at -against the wind, which was blowing the clouds around quite a bit at that time- and the straight line it travelled in, discounted that theory.    I also thought of the possibility of a goose, but I'm not sure they fly at night and would think if a goose belly would be that visible at night then so would its wings. It looked to be roughly several hundred feet in the air, though I'm not a good judge of altitude. I watched it for about a minute until it disappeared into the swirling clouds to the nw. The entire incident was over with before I could have run inside to get a camera. The dog displayed no odd behavior, and after scanning the sky for a few minutes to see if there were any other objects, I went inside. Loveland CO is nestled just east the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. In town you might need to crane your neck to see the mountains over your neighbors roof or fence, but it's fairly close. The terrain is flat and grassy with sparse groupings of trees, so much of the sky is visible anywhere you might be.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765

Observers:  2 males aged 17 and 55 female aged 59  Weather conditions:  Sunny, clear skies (zero clouds), slight breeze  Initial Sighting:  17 year old male observed what appeared to be a meteorite while driving. He stopped the car to observe direction of location of impact.  He described the event as ‘a teardrop shape object from which smoke and what appeared to be flames or heat of some type from the bottom of the object streaming to the top of the object’.  The object stopped its descent at which time he observed an oval shape having a black ring at its bottom’. Witness sightings:  55 year old male and 59 year old female. The 17 year old male rushed to our home to tell us he saw a UFO.  Disbelieving his claim we accompanied him to the front yard of our home and looked in the sky at the direction he instructed.  We saw a small silver/white oval in the distance hovering above the far corner of a neighboring house across the street from our house.  The sky behind, around the object was clear blue, not a cloud in the sky that morning. The 55 year old male rushed to get our camera a Nikon 15megpixel, gave the camera to the 17 year old male who then snapped a series of 16 pictures of the object. We are able to make out the object in the pictures however need to locate the means of enhancing the picture to clearly define the object.  This said, based on our ability to view the object it is indeed is a domed oval shape having a darken space at its underside (what we assume to be its underside). During the 15 minute or so observation we witnessed the object bank (assumed as turning) then disappear from the sky.  Shortly thereafter the 17 year old male witnessed military jets (4) fly over the exact location where the object had been located.  The 59 year old female witnessed 2 of the 4 jets fly over the aforementioned location. Witnessing of the jet fly over:  59 year old female: Obviously military because of the tight formation (commercial or private aircraft would never fly as closely together as these jets did).  The jets were black, wings angled back towards the fuselage of the plane.  The jets were silent just as the unidentified flying object was silent.  The jets flew from the east/ southeast to the west/ northwest.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Orange lights in the sky over Loveland, CO.;2013-12-25 19:15:00;10 minutes;Orange lights in the sky over Loveland. As I was looking at the sky facing South South East I watched a seemly large, orange lozenge shaped light fly in a slow arch traveling at a high rate of speed.  As I watched the light flickered twice and disappeared.  The light appeared near a plane light, the differences being obvious;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765

I watched until the sun went down and was able to tell they were medal as they reflected the sunset.  They sat in the same place until it was dark then appeared to get smaller and faded away.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
