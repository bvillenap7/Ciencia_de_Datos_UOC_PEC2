Silver metallic cross and ring with white lights hovering above the highway.;2009-03-22 19:50:00;15 minutes;Silver metallic cross and ring with white lights hovering above the highway. On the evening of March 22, 2009, at approximately 19:45 hours, I was traveling southbound on I-25 approximately five miles north of the Loveland, CO area when I noticed a set of lights in the sky that were approximately 250’ above the ground that were remaining stationary.  As I traveled closer I was able to see that the lights were part of an aircraft/mechanical object.  This object was directly above the southeast corner of the I-25 to C-392 interchange.  The object was comprised of square shaped beams making up a metallic silver cross of equal dimension on the x and y axis, with a circular shaped ring of the same silver metallic material that encompassed the outside of the cross and connected at the ending points of the cross itself.  The distance/size across the bottom of the cross/ring section was approximately 50 feet. There was a large dome light in the direct center of the cross, and four smaller lights at the end points of cross sections just prior to where the circular section met the square cross sections.  There was a dark, solid section that extended above the cross/circle, but I was unable to identify any specific details/shape of this dark colored area.  It’s height seemed to be about one third to half the size of the width of the craft.  The five lights on the bottom of the craft were solid white, neither blinking nor changing color.  The large center light was the lowest part of the craft, with no type of landing gear or runners (such as seen on helicopters) being visible. The craft was perfectly stationary as it hovered in the air, neither tilting nor moving in any specific direction.  After I passed by/under it, and traveled for approximately ¼ of a mile, the craft tilted on an approximate 30 degree slant and began to slowly travel towards the west.  I could no longer identify/see the craft after five minutes or so. There were numerous people/cars traveling on the road at this time who also could have seen this craft quite easily, but I have not been able to find any mention of this type of craft or anyone who saw it and/or had the opportunity to photographed or video capture the event.

extremely bright light over tree in loveland, CO;2010-01-02 23:17:00;5 minutes;extremely bright light over tree in loveland, CO While driving home from work, I spotted an extremely bright object in the sky.  As I turned onto my road the object started flying closer and closer to my vehicle.  It was so bright I could not tell what it was, and had a glow around it, like you see aroung the moon.  As I got out of the vehicle to look at it, it silently started descending over a nearby tree about 50 yards away.  I watched it for about 15-20 seconds and then it slowly went backwards, flew around another tree and took off quickly;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
