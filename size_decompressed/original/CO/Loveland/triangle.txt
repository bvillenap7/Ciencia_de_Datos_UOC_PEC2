Triangle ship following a ball of light.;1995-11-23 19:00:00;30 minutes;Triangle ship following a ball of light. Triangle ship with lights that were triangle to.  It was following a small ball of light.   Watched them fly north along the Rockies.  They flew to the south side of Fort Collins, and the the ball turned south and so did the ship.  They were not moving very fast all.   Before I left Fort Collins, I saw a low flying military airplane flying over the south side of Fort Collins.  Looked like a HUGE plane, but going slow, too.

Triange object;2005-04-12 21:00:00;5 sec;Triangle object While sitting in the hot tub I usually look up at the sky to look for for satellites.  I noticed a triangle shaped object moving north about 500 feet high.  It was a quiet night and the tub jets were not on.  The object was totally quiet.  It went over the top of the house and was gone.   One year ago or so I saw a similar black trinagle much closer while sitting in the hot tub with my 14 year old son. We both saw this object.  The bottom had 10 black circles in a triangle pattern.  This ogject was only 100 feet up or so and was completely silent.  We both saw it for about 10 seconds as it moved north.  The object moved slowly say 50 mph.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
4 Synchronized Lights Flying above Loveland;2007-09-02 11:00:00;2 minutes;4 Synchronized Lights Flying above Loveland While returning home from errands, my daughter and I noticed 4 shimmering lights in the sky North West of 43rd and Taft at approximately 11am. All 4 lights flew in a synchronized formation and would shimmer, disappear and reappear laterally in a different part of the sky a second later. They did this continuously for about 2 minutes until they just disappeared.  The best way to describe the event was that they were almost dancing in the sky. They were shaped in a triangular shape and very shiny, and could move from one area in the sky to another area in the sky in less than a second. The sky was clear and sunny with almost no clouds in the sky. There was no obstruction of our view. We did not notice any vapor trails or hear any sounds.Unfortunately I was unable to obtain any images.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
