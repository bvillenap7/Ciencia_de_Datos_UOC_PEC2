Lights to the west over the mountains;2005-07-30 19:00:00;35 mins;Lights to the west over the mountains My wife and I were standing on the balcony enjoying the evening when I noticed a bright light in the sky to the west, I pointed this to my wife and she agreed that it looked like a star, but it was to light outside not another single star was visible,  I thought we could be looking at a plane or another aircraft approaching as Loveland has a small airfield of its own and we are very close to Denver. I made this decision as there was a level of movement on the light both up and down and side to side but only slightly so we thought it may have been heading straight at us.  I then noticed another object close by but appeared to be at a different altitude and was not nearly as bright, this I assumed was another plane following in. I was happy with my guess until the first object literally dropped from the sky behind an apartment building blocking the rest of the view, the secondary object seem to get dimmer and completely disappear,  At first reactions from residents has been probably children with fireworks but this was no firework, It was over the mountains not actually in Loveland I don't think kids will trek into the mountains to have fun with rockets.

((HOAX??))  Craft with four white lights.;2014-07-31 22:45:00;5 seconds;Craft with four white lights. I was sitting on my back porch with my fiance & were stargazing.  At 10:45 pm, I observed a craft flying overhead.  It had the shape of a trapezoid.   I observed the craft between two trees in the backyard for 5 seconds.  It was flying North.  It was moving faster than anything I've ever seen & it was silent.  The sky was clear & the craft really stood out in the night sky.It had four visible lights that were a dim white in color.   This is the shape that I observed.  The dots represent the light's that I saw & with the two lights that are closest together would be the front of the craft.

 I spotted an extremely bright light to the South East.;2018-06-23 23:25:00;4 minutes;My family and I were driving south on Taft Hill Road, between Fort Collins and Loveland, Colorado when I spotted an extremely bright light to the South East.  I would estimate it floating, stationary, about 300 to 400 feet in the air. It is raining and a thunderstorm behind the object so it was not a star or a drone of any sort. I have flown drones and lived in the area long enough to know where drones are flown and what they look like. My wife and daughter watched it while I drove, wondering what it was.  They then said, It just disappeared!  I asked my wife for a more detailed explanation and she said that it didn't drop to the ground or fly up into the storm clouds.  It vanished.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
