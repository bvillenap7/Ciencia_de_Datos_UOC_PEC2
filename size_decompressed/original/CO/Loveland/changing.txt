I saw what originally looked like five lights of aircraft heading east towards me over the mountains, all in a line, one after the other.  As they got closer, the lights took up a stationary position in a row off in the distance, then moved to what looked like a perfect number five from a dice.  They didn't move from this position for approximately 30 seconds, then one by one they flew off quickly to the northwest until they were quickly out of sight. This happened around 18:00 hours, from memory I believe it was late October or early November, it was dark, and this occurred during my drive home from work. I have never before, or since, seen what could be considered a U.F.O. I was around 43 at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

5 glimmering stationary objects for 20 minutes and then vanished;2017-11-08 20:50:00;20 minutes;5 glimmering stationary objects for 20 minutes and then vanished I was looking East while driving home up Pole hill mountain West of Loveland and Stopped immediately when I saw 5 stationary glimmering lights changing color from red and white and yellow.  Got my binoculars out and got a better look.  It was changing shapes in the sense of light flickering.   I drove up to look out point and lost view of 2 of them as they were further South.  A car was there and I got out of my truck and asked them if they are seeing what I was.  They said yes, and I told them to look through my binoculars.  He was blown away like I was.  I took pictures and video for confirmation.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
