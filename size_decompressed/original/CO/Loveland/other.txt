NORAD Bulletin board says 800 unknowns tracked last year;1995-05-31 18:00:00;30 seconds;NORAD Bulletin board says 800 unknowns tracked last year During a KWGN news show about NORAD (Cheyenne mountain - Colorado Springs, CO), the camera was pointed at the female t.v. journalist. To her side, and behind her was a bulletin board with the words: 800 unknowns tracked last year, or words very close to that.  I've tried to contact KWGN in Denver, but to no avail. I don't know if they knew the camera was on that bulletin board or not, but, for just a few seconds (maybe 20 to 30) were the words that haunt me.  NORAD tracks ALL debris, aircraft, spacecraft, spacejunk, anything that flys or is in orbit around the planet. For those words to be where they were, is paramount to saying the AIR FORCE admits they can NOT identify at least 800 bogies in a year. That says a LOT. Although it is not proof positive of FLYING SAUCERS, it is a far cry from the hardline statements that UFO's are swamp gas, clouds, meteors, or imagination.  Hope maybe you could dig deeper and find out if they still have the tape of that special on Cheyenne Mountain. It aired in May of 1995 as I recall. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

ofznge/red ring.  Dark in the center.  Low flying, and quiet.;2001-07-15 01:50:00;30-45 sec;ofznge/red ring.  Dark in the center.  Low flying, and quiet. This was a ring shape.  Orange/red in color, with clean edges so it was not like a burner. Dark in the center.  Slow and low flying.  Quiet.  I am curious as to why this was not posted on your sight.  By not posting this you have lost credibility with me.  This was real, and I looked to your sight for some answers.  If you do not post it, how can others see it?  I also so no evidence of any ring shapes.  I would think that would be reason enough to post it. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see entry for event on 15JL01 @ 0150 hrs.  We have corrected the date to 15JL01, as originally indicated by the witness, although other reports were submitted from Colorado for 17JL01.  Original report was posted to our website.

Bright starlike object slowly fades at initial viewing;2005-09-16 05:49:00;10 seconds;Bright starlike object slowly fades at initial viewing While walking the dog early A.M. on Friday 9/16/05, I periodically looked up at the sky, as it was still dark with stars out and the barest tinge of purple on the eastern horizon. The sky was totally clear, no clouds. I was walking west on a rural road so viewing conditions were unobstructed. After one of many glances upwards, I looked back down and out of my peripheral vision noticed a light on my shoulder as if from a light source similar in intensity to a full moon. Knowing the full moon wasn't visible at that time I looked up again and in the same spot I had just observed I noticed a bright starlike object, roughly halfway between Mars and Orion (locations of both later confirmed with Sky and Telescope interactive starchart for date and that time of morning). It was white, unmoving, silent, brighter than Venus, and as soon as I looked at it, the object began to fade from view.  The light I noticed on my shoulder makes me think it was even brighter before I looked up. It seemed there was a slight haze around the object as it faded and it was completely gone within 10 seconds.  I watched for at least another minute and saw no other lights or objects in that spot. I kept looking up to that area every few seconds while I continued walking but saw no further objects.  If not an unknown, then conventional explanations might be a glint of light off a coincidentally perfectly positioned satellite, an orbital SDI test, or a supernova from light years away that I just happened to glance up at the perfect time for - there go my lotto odds.  Any explanation for this?;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Crescent shaped bright object with green and red edges seen through telescope.;2007-07-04 22:15:00;30 minutes;Crescent shaped bright object with green and red edges seen through telescope. After the fireworks display on July 4th, my husband and I were headed home a short distance away.  I happened to look toward the mountains in the west and saw what appeared to be a huge star perhaps 3 fingerbreadths above the foothills which are about a mile and a half from where we are located..  I alerted my husband and he saw it too. At first I thought it might be a planet, but I had been observing Jupiter recently which is the brightest “star” in the night sky, and this object was about twice the size and brightness of Jupiter.  We were headed to a party 2 houses down the block where we live but after 10 minutes or so  I went home to watch from my backyard, hoping perhaps to set up my telescope and be able to discern its shape.  I looked toward the west again and watched it for another 10 minutes or so.  It was stationary to my eye but just as I decided to lug out my telescope, the light from this object became dimmer until it disappeared.  The next night it was there again at about the same time  but I was only able to watch for about 5 minutes before is disappeared again.  I surmised that  the object was stationary and had not actually vanished but slowly disappeared behind the mountains due to the rotation of the earth.  On the third night (July 6th)  I saw it again in  what appeared to be the same place.  This time I immediately got out my telescope.   With the naked eye, although it was very bright, I could see that it wasn’t exactly circular in shape, seeming to have a couple of sharp points.  When I focused my telescope I was amazed to see an object which was roughly crescent shaped, with the rounded side facing downwards toward the mountains. One edge had a reddish hue and the other edge was greenish but the colors and the entire object seemed to be shimmering or more accurately, waving.  I thought that perhaps I was visualizing an atmospheric distortion so I focused my scope on Jupiter which was more southerly.  I could see the planet very clearly and distinctly with no distortion.  Through the lens of the telescope this UFO was approximately 3 times the size of Jupiter and the light from it was not the almost pure white light which emanates from the planet Jupiter.  The light from this object was slightly warmer with the red and green edges as I mentioned.  I am sorry that I didn’t think to get my video camera out to film it.   After the 6th,  I have not seen this object again.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
Large white light shrouded in 'fog' travels slowly across sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space X booster venting fuel??  PD));2018-02-06 19:40:00;25 minutes;Large white light shrouded in 'fog' travels slowly across sky. I live close to downtown Loveland and was standing on my front porch looking to the Southwest.  I saw what at first looked like the white light of an airplane behind clouds.  Then I realized that it was moving too slow for an airplane and I could otherwise see stars.  This light traveled slowly across the sky from west to east and was shrouded in a fog of some type.  That part of the event lasted about 5 to 6 minutes. Then as the light was over the downtown area, directly to the South of me, I noticed that it turned on a light from the rear side (I say rear because it was opposite of the direction it was traveling in).  Very bright, strong, v-shaped light beam.  Since it was much closer to me at that point and because it turned on a light, I was able to see the air disturbance.  The fog was almost phosphorescent, also flaring out in a dramatic v-shape.  Then all of it just kind of became indistinct (turned its lights down?) and disappeared completely.  The fog it left in its wake became distorted and from the pattern of the fog (there was a stream going downward) either the craft went down toward Earth or shot straight up. Then at 8:08pm, with still no substantial cloud build-up, there was a sudden flash of light.  At this point I was standing on my back patio, which faces East. The kicker is, I texted a friend who lives over by the foothills (about 11 miles west of me) and they had seen the craft as well.  Her neighbor was outside on her porch and had also seen what she thought was the flare of fireworks at the time I saw the ‘lightning’ flash. ((NUFORC Note:  Space X booster venting fuel??

A flame in the sky;2021-02-12 19:00:00;10 minutes;A flame in the sky On 2/12/21the 3 of us were on our way home. Noticed a bright flame in the sky. I was driving and noticed it first and pointed it out to my passengers.  At first we thought it be could a meteorite coming down but it appeared to have directional control.  We pulled over to observe the object. The passenger in the front passenger seat was the only one that could see the object because of how I was parked. They stated that the object shot straight up and disappeared in the clouds.  We are in winter and that night there was cloud cover. The flame was bright and large. Looked cone shaped. We waited to see if it would reappear but it did not.;40.4075317647059;-105.093339411765
