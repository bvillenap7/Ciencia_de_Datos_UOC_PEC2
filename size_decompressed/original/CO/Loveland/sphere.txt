Then the spheres formed a line and vanished. I was in Loveland, CO, with my kids, and we where flying kites then I noticed 3 spheres shaping a triangle.  The spheres where copper with darker shadows.   As they came passing by one of the spheres stopped, while the other two kept moving.  Then the 3 spheres formed a line and vanished.  During this time, it was hard to look at the sky because there was a lot of static in the sky.  The sighting only lasted about 3 minutes.  They appeared on the Eastern side and moved south before vanishing. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
