It appeared in the sky out of nowhere at about 45 degrees in elevation and then shot straight down to below the horizon in about 2 seconds. It did not flash or sparkle like a normal SS. summary says it all;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Large black object that never moved for 12 min;2003-05-24 19:45:00;12 MIN;Large black object that never moved for 12 min Me and my 3 year old daughter were standing outside in our back yard- and i noticed a big black spot in the sky- it kinda looked like a hot air balloon way to high up in the sky- I was on the phone at the time with a friend - and told him I had to go - that something weird was in the sky- I ran and got my Binoculars and then viewed the object- My binoculars are the little ones- so thru them it only appeared to be a larger black spot- The object never moved the whole time I looked at it- it just got harder too see- after about 10 to 12 min it just kinda faded away- Through the Binoculars I could definetly tell it was not an aircraft as we know it- the weird thing is it never moved ((NUFORC Note:  We believe this report alludes to an evening sighting.  We have amended the time above.  PD));39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Diffuse coherent ghostlike object seen rapidly crossing night sky.;2004-09-06 22:05:00;5 seconds;Diffuse coherent ghostlike object seen rapidly crossing night sky. The object passed almost directly overhead from northwest to southeast, covering an arc distance of approximately 50 degrees in approximately 5 seconds. This appeared to be at a very high altitude. The most notable feature of this object was its ghostlike nature. It appeared similar to a telescopic view of a nebula and had a diameter of about 15 minutes - about half that of the lunar/solar disk. It was very faint but distinct. I was enjoying the crystal clear dark sky on the Labor Day evening. I don't think I would have noticed it otherwise, but I happened to be looking straight up at the time just as it passed across my line of sight. I followed it until I lost sight of it to the southeast at about 45 degrees elevation. It was not pointlike like a meteor and was not brilliant like a fireball. It was a diffuse, ghostly object that swiftly passed overhead. I have never seen anything remotely similar to this. I report it here because it was astounding and I couldn't identify this flying object.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Dozens of tiny specks floating, pulses of light, green object comet like;2006-05-15 12:00:00;5-10 mins;Dozens of tiny specks floating, pulses of light, green object comet like My husband and I were sitting on our porch facing the mountains, I commented on how the sunlight was reflecting off of a plane above our heads. It was at that time that I saw 2 or 3 white objects fall from beneath the place. I pointed them out to my husband and asked him if he saw what I was seeing and he replied yes. It was like seeing tiny stars from lack of oxygen that slowly disappear. A few minutes later another plane flew by over our heads and I saw dozens of these little white objects fall all at the same time from beneath the belly of the plane and slowly drift towards the mountains. The aircrafts we flying in separate directions and looked as though they were DC 10's, silver in color. I thought perhaps it may have been parachutes but I wasn't aware that dozens could jump all at once. I’m not a stranger to strange phenomenon Colorado seems a hot spot for strange light shows. I’m never exactly sure what I am seeing but I’m such a skeptic and surrounded by skeptics, I have never gone public with my sightings until now. I have seen at night in Castle Rock what looks like pulses of light, like an explosion underwater, in the sky before an object cracked like the Challenger and shot up into the night. I have also seen a green ball of light come down into the foothills of Littleton years back which illuminated the trees before it disappeared. I’m certainly not afraid but this last occurrence was a bit unsettling. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

Double oval-shaped cigar shaped craft seen at high altitude, air traffic diverted;2008-04-03 19:30:00;10 Minutes;Double oval-shaped cigar shaped craft seen at high altitude, air traffic diverted The sun was setting on the horizon near my house southwest of Denver. I frequently look up as I am an aviation enthusiast and am very observant of flight paths, and can identify any aircraft.  I started noticing something wrong when I saw a 737, an A320 and a 777 WAY off of the normal flight path into Denver International Airport.  I kept looking up when I saw a craft flying at about 40,000 to 50,000 feet.  It looked like two oval shaped cigars joined somehow.  When I first saw it, I thought it was wreckage from some type of mid-air catastrophe due to its strange way of moving, but realized it was something else when it continued northbound in the sky for about 10 minutes. The way it flew looked like something tumbling, yet in control. Like it was rolling in all directions while still flying in a straight, coordinated manner. I am an extreme skeptic, and usually write-off UFO sightings as military craft, or natural phenomena. But, what I saw was not earthly. I know alot about aviation, and nothing, I repeat NOTHING can fly like that. It was black, and gave off a glare from the sun's reflection.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

Cool ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Unknown hellicoptor type object chasing bright light.;2012-04-21 00:00:00;4 minutes;Unknown hellicoptor type object chasing bright light I thought it was a helicopter at first.  Loud noise, vibrated house.   Flew by once, we did not look.  Came by 2nd time, I took my son out to see it because thought it was military.  What I saw scared my son and he started crying.  Object appeared to be very long and thin.  Black.  It was chasing a bright round light.  Smaller red light also seen.  There were no blinking lights on object that normal aircraft have.  It was hard to see shape as it was black in night sky but I described it as a long stick.  Made propeller noises, but no propellers seen.  Flew lower than helicopter as well.  I don't know what kind of military aircraft we would have that made such loud noise.  Very confusing and also scary.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

Seen in the exact same place and same distance apart in the sky between 11pm and 1am every night for about 2 weeks now.  Appears and vanishes faster than a blink but always in the same time frame.
