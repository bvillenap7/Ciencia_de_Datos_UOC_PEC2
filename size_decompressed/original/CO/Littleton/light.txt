Two fixed star-like objects in Littleton, CO;2002-01-03 17:55:00;20 seconds;Two fixed star-like objects in Littleton, CO I was outside talking on the phone to my nephew in Ohio trying to instruct him on how to find Saturn from Jupiter in his telescope (he was not outdoors in Ohio at the time).  It was a crystal clear night sky in Denver at the time.  As I was talking to him, I looked to the North of Saturn, just East of the constellation Cassiopea and saw two bright lights fixed (not moving)approximately 10 degrees apart at an elevation about 45 degrees above the Eastern horizon.  They were very bright, both with the same magnitude, nearly that of Jupiter.  They looked beautiful, like a wide double start system.  As I continued talking I saw one light begin to fade, then about 4 seconds later, the other faded also.  They both became dark.  They appeared to have angular dimention, as opposed to being like point star light sources.  They also appeared to be very high.  When they both faded away, none of the other stars in their vicinity faded.  I then, about a minute later, saw two aircraft with navigation lights flying in the vicinity (about 20,000 feet)in differnt directions. I can only surmise that I was looking at two satelites in a fixed geosychros orbit.  It was about two hours after local sunset.  I'm thinking the objects faded when the earth's shadow engulfed them.  I wanted to look at the same time tonite (01/04), buts its snowing and overcast. ((Second report from same source.)) Two bright fixed starlike lights dimmed and faded to darkness on a cloudless evening. I was outside talking on the phone trying to tell my nephew in Ohio how to find Saturn from Jupiter in his telescope.  The sky that night in Denver was clear, about 5:55 pm, 2 hours after sunset.  As I was describing this I looked to the North, just East of the constellation Cassiopeia, about 45 degrees up from the Eastern horizon, saw two bright starlike objects.  They looked beautiful.  They looked like a set of double stars separated by 8-10 degrees.  They were fixed, not moving.  Both brightness magnitudes were as bright as Jupiter. They appeared to have angular width, not points of light.  It's difficult to say, but I'd estimate altitude at 20,000 feet.  As I was still talking, one of the lights started to dim.  After 2-3 seconds, the other light also dimmed.  Both dimmed to darkness.  No other surrounding stars dimmed.  Following my observation there were two aircraft with navigation lights that flew into the vicinty.  My best explanation is that they are two satelites in close proximity to each other in geosynchonos (fixed?) orbits.  They dimmed when the earth's shadow enveloped them?;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Beautiful blue light flashes by me.;2005-07-23 01:45:00;5 seconds;Beautiful blue light flashes by me. My wife had just given birth to a beautiful baby girl and I was driving home to get some sleep. I was traveling along C-470 back to Littleton from Lone Tree. I thought I saw a police car blue light flashing on a flyover and I looked again but there was no flyover. The light flashed again, closer but still seemingly a point light source. It was a beautiful irridescent? cobalt? blue. It flashed another two times seemingly getting closer and then it streaked past like a line of the same blue. Perhaps my emotions got the better of me but I thought I'd document it anyway to see if anyone has shared the experience. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Please remove my recent report - determined to be a blue flashing light on a post at the side of the road. Please ignore my previous submission. It turned out to be a blue light on the top of a post. I saw it a couple of days later on the side of the road. I think it is probably a weather station. That's what happens when you don't get a lot of sleep after holding your wife's hand during labor :-);39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Pulsating light with no red beacon, navagation or strobe lights moving into a lightning storm.;2012-04-26 22:35:00;3 min;Pulsating light with no red beacon, navagation or strobe lights moving into a lightning storm. I was walking southbound on the Highline Canal Trail in Highlands Ranch Co, observing an intense lightning storm when I noticed a pulsating light moving from left to right.  This object was moving fairly slow with and erratic ascent towards the storm and then it disappeared.  This object seemed to be a few miles away with no red beacon, navigation or strobe lights like the other air traffic in the area.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Unknown light over Lookout Mountain.;2012-07-11 21:00:00;10;Unknown light over Lookout Mountain Sitting on the patio looking approximately 15 miles northwest towards the Lookout Mountain light towers, three people witnessed a ball of yellow-white light flying around the towers in no specific pattern.  The ball of light headed east and quickly turned back west, before finally disappearing into the mountains.  The range of the flying object was too vast to be a common radio-controlled craft and moved too low, fast, and sharp to be any known, piloted craft.   However the light was certainly that of a flying object and not of a spotlight.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Several glowing objects flying side-by-side at low altitude making no noise.;2017-01-20 20:50:00;00:03;Several glowing objects flying side-by-side at low altitude making no noise. We saw what appeared to be a lights flying side-by-side.  They reminded me of luminaries, but they were obviously under some kind of control, as they were flying in a straight line, heading northeast to southwest.    Then they moved back and forth toward one another, almost like they were one unit.   We then noticed two more coming over the horizon, so I started to record them.  They continued to come in tandem, making absolutely no noise.  For the life of me I have no idea what they could have been, but I can’t imagine them being any kind of aircraft or drone, as they made no noise and didn’t have any red or green lights, only a steady warm yellow glow.   All in all we saw at least 8 . I will upload the video.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

Bright light seen tracking an airplane, joined by another light and then disappears.;2019-04-27 13:30:00;10 minutes;Bright light seen tracking an airplane, joined by another light and then disappears. Looking north from my backyard into the clear blue sky, watching the planes in the distance just coming from DIA, I noticed a circular bright light a distance behind one of the planes and it kept the distance the same for about 5 minutes.  It didn't look like a plane so I got out my binoculars and it was a round bright light, yellow and orange in color.  It then proceeded to go higher into the atmosphere and was joined by another bright orange/yellow light and they seemed to stay apart, then come together, then apart and then after a minute or so they just disappeared.  I would guess the planes from my backyard were about 25-30 miles north of me.  The bright lights seemed to be about 1/4 of the size of an airplane.  Thought they might be drones, but would have to be quite large for me to have seen at this distance.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

Long string of a line of stellar type objects moving from SSW to NNE.;2021-05-07 00:00:00;~2-3 minutes;Long string of a line of stellar type objects moving from SSW to NNE. I am a seasoned amateur astronomer. Went out to look at the night sky to check out my new eyeglasses. Looked upward toward the zenith near the north. Movement of stars caught my eye. Then I saw more moving points of light. First thought was a satellite array moving together then it became evident that there were scores of objects (maybe 20-30) following in a straight line moving from SSW to NNE through tail of Ursa Major. I would estimate the brightness of the points of light to be -2 magnitude. All followed the same path. Spacing was not uniform. No noise. They flickered out before reaching the horizon (possibly passing through the earths shadow terminator.  Might have been multiple deployments of satellites.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
