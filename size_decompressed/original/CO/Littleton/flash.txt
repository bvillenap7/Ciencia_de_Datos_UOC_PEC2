Bright Orange streak in Littleton Colorado sky Oct 2007.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible high-altitude contrail, perhaps.  PD));2007-10-29 05:00:00;1 minute;Bright Orange streak in Littleton Colorado sky Oct 2007 About 4:45 am I went outside to look at some owls and notice a bright orange light out of the corner of my right eye,  At first I thought it was a airplane, then I realize it wasnt.  It was a very bright orange very long streak in the sky, if I had to measure it I would have said it was maybe 1/2 mile long, and only a few hundred feet up in the air. I stood there and watched it as it flew by, still wondering was this a comet, but this thing went straight across the sky from west to east.  Running along above Bowels Avenue. I figured this counldnt be a comet, it would have been on the news, plus it was way too close to earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
