white balloon-like object flying on its own volition, i.e. not with wind direction;2003-07-11 11:27:00;1 minute;white balloon-like object flying on its own volition, i.e. not with wind direction I was looking out my office window, which faces west, and noticed a smallish round object (not a pinpoint) moving on a direct west to east trajectory about to fly over my building.  In the first seconds, I thought perhaps it was a white helium balloon drifting overhead, but it seemed too steady and deliberate to be a balloon. I ran outside as it flew right over my best guess is that it was about a mile up.  The sun was in my eyes but I caught sight of the object again as it continued on, apparently heading directly east.  The ground level winds were variably, but mostly coming from the N/NE.  I watched the clouds, which were primarily over the mountains to the west, and, noted that they were drifting primarily in a southerly direction (and probably easterly as well).  Whatever this was, it seemed to move by its own volition. This is not the first time I've noticed and reported similar objects outside my office here in Littleton.  I work in sales and am a very avid skywatcher. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness means a date in July, not August, so we have amended the date above.

Small light colored or silver sphere moving in circular pattern;2011-06-28 11:41:00;4 minutes;Small light colored or silver sphere moving in circular pattern While standing outside my home in Littleton Colorado which directly southwest of Denver Colorado I noticed a small light colored or silver sphere shaped object moving in a slow counter-clockwise pattern in the sky slightly southwest of my location.  The object was small in size but clearly visible in a cloudless sky. After a period of about 3 or 4 minutes the object suddenly broke pattern and made a beeline to the northwest at a relatively high rate of speed (much faster than an airplane).  I watched until the object disappeared from my view. I was with several family members at the time who were not able to see the object themselves with the naked eye.  After the incident I realized I was the only one wearing polarized sunglasses which apparently made the object more visible.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Object falling from sky.;2013-10-31 19:00:00;15;Object falling from sky We were night watching when a large object appeared in the sky.  We thought it was a star at first, but then realized it was falling and also was way to large.   The object was sphere shaped in the west part of the sky.  It was slowly falling and after about ten minutes vanished from sight.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Bright white object in the sky above Littleton, Colorado, around 0905, 15 August 2014.;2014-08-15 09:05:00;75 minutes;Bright white object in the sky above Littleton, Colorado, around 0905, 15 August 2014. I was on my deck in the rear of my house, when the sound of an airplane engine (prop) brought my attention to the south eastern sky around 0905 on the 15th of August, 2014.  I saw bright white dot in the sky just south of the sun and just above it as well, I didn't pay much attention to it but when I looked back up about ten minutes later and it was still there, I thought it was a bit strange...  Please keep in mind that the moon was also visible in the western sky.   I went back in my house and watched TV for a bit, and then decided to go out on my front porch to see if the object was still there, and it was.  It had moved to the west a bit but at about the same elevation as before, this was around 0930.   I went out again around 1000, and it was still there, but it was now due south at about the same elevation.  I checked again around 1010, and it was still present but a few degrees farther west.  When I checked again around 1020 it was gone.  It seemed to track as if it were stationary in space and the Earths rotation was causing the movement.  I'm assuming this was some sort of satellite that was reflecting light from the sun or possibly indirectly from sunlight reflected from the moon.  To my eye and through a 9X rifle scope it was about the size of a .22 caliber bullet held at arms length.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
