It was a while ago but I remember it extremely clearly, it was a birthday party or something and we were out back when I and a couple others spotted a cone shape object flying over the neighborhood. The point was facing the sky and it was spinning, not too fast, about 1 spin per second, it was moving about 50-70mph and was about as high as a helicopter would fly maybe lower. It was bright out and sunny so I got a good look at it.  It wasn't smooth but more like crafted metal placed together other than one big piece.  (Picture the texture of the melenium falcon) I can't tell if there were lights but small bulb shaped rapped around the bottom ring of the object were present.  I dont remember the exact date other than it was around the beginning of the decade in summer time.  No other objects were seen with the cone, it didn't shoot off anything or cause any weird anomalies. It just flew past and nothing came of it.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
