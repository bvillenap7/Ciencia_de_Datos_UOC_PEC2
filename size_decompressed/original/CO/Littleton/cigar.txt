Cigar shaped flying object appears for 3-5 seconds in the southern sky;2004-09-17 13:50:00;3-5 seconds;Cigar shaped flying object appears for 3-5 seconds in the southern sky I was driving south towards C-470 on Kipling with my car window rolled down.  Through the winshield of my car I spotted a silver cigar shaped object appear in the sky (the object looked like a silver platter until it rolled on it's side then it looked like a cigar).  Once I saw the thing in the air I looked out my car driver side window as I was at a stop light and the thing was still there.  Unfortunately this thing only was around for about 5 seconds that I could see it.  I would have to say that if straight up was 12 o'clock and the base of the foothills were 3 o'clock then it appeared to be in the 1 o'clock position.  The object was moving in an easterly direction initially, I would say the length seemed to be bigger than most airplanes  and helicopters that usually fly in our area. Up until that point I saw no planes, helicopters or hot air balloons in the sky.  The object seemed to rotate or flip on it's side and move up in the straight up in the air.  At this time I thought it might be a plane, but it then disappeared.  It seemed to faded in the background of the sky, but there were no clouds or anything else to hide it.  I continued to look for any signs of planes or anything that could explain this but I cannot find any.  I continued to look in the southern sky for the next 5 minutes but could not find any signs of it again.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Sighting over Littleton on Wednesday.;2020-01-29 16:00:00;30 seconds;Sighting over Littleton on Wednesday. I've seen three in my area in the last year. I always get a feeling to look up. I'm parked at a turn signal on Belleview and Kipling. I see a contrail to the west over the foothills. I see a glint reflection off a metal craft at about the same elevation, but maybe twice the size of the airplane producing the contrail. It flies parallel to the contrail for a few seconds then makes an abrupt left turn in the direction of, and in line with, the Lockheed facility in the neighborhood. At that point I notice it is cigar-shaped, identical to the craft seen over Los Angeles last week. It floats in the sky traveling south at a walking pace and then in a clear blue sky disappears.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
