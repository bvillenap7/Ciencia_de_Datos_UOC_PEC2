three star-like objects moving in a straight line over Denver area;2003-01-31 10:30:00;3 minutes;three star-like objects moving in a straight line over Denver area I work in sales, and currently have a good view of the mountains west of Denver from my office window.  While I'm on the phone I tend to look out at the sky and clouds.  Today I looked up at a contrail and immediately noticed something moving near it -- a pinpoint of light, like a satellite, but obviously a satellite can't be seen during the day!  The light was on a very steady trajectory from N/NW to the S/SE, moving about as fast as a satellite would.  I thought it might be a mylar balloon, as it was moving in the same direction as the cloud-level winds but slightly faster than the clouds, which were higher (i.e., the light was seen against the cloud backdrop -- it was partly cloudy).  But within seconds, I noticed another light, following in a straight line behind it, and I put my fist up to see how many degrees apart they were.  If my fist is 5 degrees, which is what I remember from astrophysics class, then they were about 2 or 3 degrees apart.  Then I noticed a THIRD light, equidistant from these two, so that they formed a string of three star- or satellite-like lights traversing the daytime sky.  I watched until they disappeared to the left from my window view -- a few minutes.  Because there was sun in the east, I could have been seeing a reflection off mylar or other metal, but I couldn't say with certainty that they were not self-luminous either.  And because they travelled in a straight line and were equidistant, I find it hard to believe they were mylar balloons, unless they were connected by a very long string! ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM SAME WITNESS)) Correction to report This is a correction to the report I made on 1/31/03.  For one thing, I may have entered 1/31/02 by accident, but it was 1/31/03, the same day I reported it.  Furthermore, I had forgotten that a fist-width at arm's length is 10 degrees, not 5, as I guessed in my initial report.  Therefore, the distance between the first and second object, and between the second and third objects, was about 5 degrees -- about half a fist-width at arms length.

What appeared to be 3 normal stars began to move in perfect formation, then faded from view.  ((NUFORC Note:  NOSS satellite.  PD));2004-05-08 23:15:00;30-45 sec.;What appeared to be 3 normal stars began to move in perfect formation, then faded from view. While looking up at the stars, a friend and i both noticed at about the some time that a few stars appeared to be moving.  We pointed them out to the third person there and watched as the stars continued to move in a large isosoles triangle formation.  The formation was much larger than any plane could have been, even if it was at low altitude-the formation was approx. half the area of the inside of the little dipper, which is where we first spotted it.  the object continued to move at a fairly good clip, at one point obstructing the view of another stationary star, until it faded from view.

Glowing orange spheres in a V pattern in sky southwest of Littleton, moving eastward.;2014-03-15 20:15:00;5-10 minutes;Glowing orange spheres in a v pattern in sky southwest of Littleton, moving eastward. My daughter and I were walking to the store, saw 6 glowing orange spheres in an upside down V in the sky southwest of Littleton, heading east at a high rate of speed.  The lights sequentially turned off, one by one.  Two other witnesses were watching this as well, transfixed.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

It was silent, moved as if each light was it's own, and appeared to be 12 or so.  The lights were a dim blue you had to focus on them to see them.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
