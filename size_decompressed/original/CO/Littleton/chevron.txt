Stealthy chevron with dim white lights;2015-11-20 01:50:00;<1 minute;Stealthy chevron with dim white lights While watching for meteors/satellites, I noticed movement to the southeast of my location.  The object was moving south at a low rate of speed which was somewhat against the local prevailing winds which were coming very lightly from the south-southwest.  The object passed over the constellation Canis Major and after about 20 seconds I lost sight as it passed behind a large tree in my yard.  I picked it up again a few seconds later on the other side of the tree and started to observe through binoculars.  The object then made a leisurely turn to the west and faded from view as it became more distant. At first glance I thought it was a deflated translucent balloon or plastic bag debris.  As I observed further I noticed the object had an angular shape and was not rotating or changing shape as you would expect with paper/plastic debris in the wind. Observation through the binoculars confirmed it was the shape of a chevron or sharp boomerang and the object appeared to be a dark blue-gray very similar to the color of the sky.  It looked like there were 2 very dim and diffuse white lights on each wing or else these lights were bands of dim reflected light. It appeared to be quite large but did not fill the entire field of view in the binoculars.  I would estimate within 2000 feet of my location at an altitude of under 1000 feet but I cannot be certain of that estimate.  The object emitted no sound and appeared to be on a controlled flight path.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
