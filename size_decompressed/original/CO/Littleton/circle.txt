groups of black circular objects;2002-09-14 06:30:00;5 - 10 min;groups of black circular objects It was a little before sunset when I was out on the balcony looking out towards the west.  I notice these black things up in the sky and thought (at first) they were geese flying.  Someone that was with me said, No, those aren't geese.  So I looked harder and noticed there were more of them.  The first bunch I saw was 5, black, circular objets, to their diagnal was 4 more, then 3, then 2, then 1.  They all seemed to be hovering in place.  After about ten minutes the first five started moving.  Then the other groups followed.  They moved west then disappered.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

Silver metallic.  Looked as if it had 3 wing like structures evenly spaced around the craft.  Was not moving at all and could not have been a balloon.  Watched it for at least 20 minutes and had to go into the house to take a shower.  Had plans to go somewhere.   After my shower I went back out to see and it was gone.  Object 2:  Also silver metallic but was more like a small rocket plane but the wings were not large as an aircraft would be.  Was moving fast rate of speed to the north west and out of sight in about 4 seconds.  No noise.  This was at the same time as the other object.  I am 63 years old.  This will be the 9th object I have seen in my lifetime.  I am not crazy and I am not stupid.  I think I know what they are.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
UFO seen in Littleton CO near airplane;2008-07-01 10:00:00;5 minutes;UFO seen in Littleton CO near airplane I witnessed a UFO, or at least I feel as if it was a UFO on July 01, 2008 at around 10:00 in the morning in Littleton, CO.  I was on my cell phone at the time and was looking at the sky at an airplane that was flying near by. Around the middle part of the airplane contrail I notice this silver, metallic/chrome/shiny looking object flying around the trail. I couldn’t really see it up close, but I did notice that the sun was reflecting off its surface and its movement was sporadic and really quick. It went back and forth. It was further back from the airplane and it looked nothing like the airplane so I definitely dismissed it as -- an airplane. It went through the trail and then flew fast upward and then disappeared.  Now, I know what airplanes look like and this wasn't an airplane! It was round -- at least it looked round maybe more like an oval is more like it. It's movement really freaked me out. I told my friend who I was talking to at the time that I had just seen something really strange (remember I was on my cell at the time). I watched it for about 5 minutes and then it did its thing as I described above. It went right through the airplane contrail and then darted right up into the sky.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

Two, bright orb-like objects seen in sky disappeared but photographed and noted a trail of parallel lines left by objects.;2013-05-02 16:17:00;2-3 minutes;Two, bright orb-like objects seen in sky disappeared but photographed and noted a trail of parallel lines left by objects I am writing to you because I wanted to share some information and I wasn't exactly sure where or with whom I should share this information.  Although it may seem relatively insignificant to many, I experienced what I deemed to be a very unusual sighting in the sky, somewhat near the foothills at about 3:17 p.m. this afternoon. I will send a photo of the same--the details appear more clearly on my iphone, from which I took the attached photograph.  Please allow me to explain what occured so that you may have an opportunity to both preview the photograph as well as understand the nature of the surrounding events because the photograph alone (even from my perspective) appears to be relatively neutral and insignificant.  I have attempted to gain a clear picture, with details that I sent from my iphone to my email and when zooming in to view details of the photo, they were very blurry.  When I zoom in on my cell phone, the details are crisp and clear, just as I am able to view the actual license plates of the cars that are in the foreground of the picture on my iphone, in the photo off the computer, the details become quite blurry.  I would be happy to send my iphone photo somehow to someone else's iphone in order to prove this point.  Please let me know because the evidence on the computerized photo is alm! ost impossible to discern. This afternoon was a fairly clear day and there were only a few, small clouds in the sky. I was driving south on Wadsworth Blvd, just south of Belleview in Littleton.  Prior to reaching the light at the interesection of Belleview and Wadsworth(from almost as far south as Cross Drive intersects Wadsworth), I noted that there seemed to be, what I thought was a plane 'hanging' in the sky.  It was approximately north by northwest, towards the mountains, at about 11 o'clock (position-wise, from where I was driving in the left hand lane, as I approached and prepared to turn west/left on Belleview).  I didn't think alot about it but I did think it was a bit unusual because of the following features:  it appeared to have only a very, small, faint trail, different from what I typically see from a large plane the faint trail was absolutely vertical in nature it seemed to hang in the sky, without moving further, it was perfectly round and bright, right to the edges of its shape, as if the sun were either directly casting its light on it or the brightness was emanating from the object itself. As a result, I kept on looking at it because it didn't seem quite right. I knew that I would be stopping to turn at Belleview and I thought that I would have a better look at it when I stopped.  As soon as I stopped in the turn lane and at the very moment that I was looking at it, another bright object, absolutely identical to the first one, suddenly appeared to the right and about (4 o'clock, by location, relative to the first object) and within eyesight of the other(not being able to estimate distance, but easily just a few miles from the first one). At that moment, since I was stopped, I thought I would grab my phone and take a photo of these two, bright objects.  The second object had no 'tail' whatsoever, it just seemed to appear out of nowhere and I was a bit flabbergasted at this.  I instantly took a photo and the instant that I lowered my camera, the right-most object disappeared entirely and then, while I was looking at the other object, it disappeared right before my ! eyes.  I was stunned.  There was no trace of the object at all. What was more astounding was the fact that the sky was quite clear...no clouds in the immediate vicinity and absolutely no 'trails' of a flying object did I perceive.  To my eyes, the sky appeared completely clear. I turned the corner and pulled into the parking lot to see what had come out on my camera.  To my dismay, it looked like an ordinary photo and nothing out of the ordinary seemed to appear.  When I magnified my photo, however, I was stunned again, because, there are TWO sets of two parallel lines that appear to trail westward(to the left) of the photo.  The one set appears more clearly, but the other set is barely visible (below the traffic lights).  This would coincide with the fact that I saw the higher object stay in the sky longer and the lower object disappeared instantly upon me taking the photo. What is clearly shown on the photo are the double lines that streak off to the left. This is my story. I have no proof or reason to share anything like this other than I am both completely perplexed and even a bit upset about what I saw today.  It was as if both the objects that I saw were either descending in a vertical fashion and/or hanging there in the sky(which is what it appeared to be, to my eyes) and then, they both suddenly, one, moments before the other, moved off westward at such an amazing speed that my eyes were unable to visualize their rapid movement in that direction.  I actually saw the one disappear in front of my eyes, but I did not visually observe the actual movement that my camera was able to capture.  I kept looking back at the sky because I couldn't believe that an object so bright and obvious, could just disappear without any trace.  The photo shows two sets of parallel lines streaking off to the left but nothing more.  I have attached the initial photo and then, I attached the photo, with circles around the lines that I noted when I enla! rged the photo on my iphone. I thank you for your consideration and I just felt that I had to record this event as accurately as possible. I know that many unusual events have been recorded over the years by many individuals but this was a first for me and I felt it important to share.  I am also very curious to know if anyone else saw anything out of the ordinary at the time.  On my actual iphone, I was able to see the license plates of the cars which were in front of me.  That's why I say that this photo, when enlarged here on my computer, only gives a fuzzy appearance of things, as well as the previously noted streaks that came out on the original photo.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

The craft changed light colors from blue to red to green and quickly plumetted to the ground in the distance.

I saw a whight object moving above my school at very high speeds.;2014-11-05 08:30:00;2 minutes;I saw a whight object moving above my school at very high speeds. I had just walked out my front gate to my school.  I looked up at the sky, a habit now. My house is on top of a hill, so I had a clear view of the sky over the school.  My eyes lade on to a circular object,  That was white, almost see-through moving about the same speed that a low flying airplane would move (but this is an optical illusion the speed of an airplane) but it was way higher than any airplane, flying low or high, would be at, therefore, flying much faster.   As I was walking to school, I stayed far from the school so I could still see it, looking down at my feet occasionally so I wouldn’t lose my step.  But, the third of forth time I did this, when I looked back up to see it again, it was gone.  I mean, like poof, it just disappeared, or it flew away at very high speeds.   Sadly, I didn't hav my Ipod with me so I couldn't take a video of it.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Five orange objects floating over Colorado.;2015-05-23 23:00:00;1 minute;Five orange objects floating over Colorado. A little after 11:00 P.M., as my family and I were heading in the house, I looked up to the west and observed five glowing orange objects moving slowly across the sky in a southerly direction. I quickly got the attention of my family members, and we were able to observe them for about a minute until they traveled out of sight. They made no noise at all.  They traveled in a line, but the distance between them seemed to fluctuate, almost like birds.  They did not move like normal aircraft, but appeared to be floating.  To me, they appeared circular.  To my dad, they appeared triangular.  Their color was beautiful.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

I was taking my dogs to go to the bathroom one last time before bed, and something glowing and giant flew across the sky.  It was far to fast to be man made and far to big to be a shooting star.   It was big enough and close enough that if it were a falling star, we would have felt the earth shake from it.  Plus, it didn’t carry the same kind of light tail that a natural object entering our atmosphere would have.  It was glowing.  Artificial light glowing.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564

Silent orb passed nearly directly overhead in the pre-dawn morning.  ((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station.  PD));2017-07-24 03:50:00;4 minutes;Silent orb passed nearly directly overhead in the pre-dawn morning. It was such a warm summer morning, so I stepped out into my backyard with a cup of coffee and took a moment to few the stars.  Nearly directly overhead a saw a light in the sky that I thought was an airplane coming into Denver Airport.  It was tracking the same flight path as most flights coming in from the west do.  Something was a little different this time.  What I first thought were landing lights were not.  It was the glow of the craft itself that I saw.  I looked for flashing beacon lights on the wings but there were none.  In fact, I could now tell there were no wings.  It was a simple orb.  It was traveling east northeast.  It was headed in the direction of DIA. As I continued to watch, it made a gentle turn to the southeast.  That is when I realized it was silent.  I said to myself What am I watching?  As it moved away from me, I was completely convinced that this was not a plane.  If it were a plane and with it past me now the landing lights would no longer be visible.  The orb was still just as bright as ever as it moved further and further away from me.  Finally it vanished beyond the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.
