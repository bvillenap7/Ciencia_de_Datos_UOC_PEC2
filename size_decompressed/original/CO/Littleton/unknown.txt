Red dot high in the sky moves very quickly and in a zigzag pattern.;2002-11-29 03:00:00;40 seconds;Red dot high in the sky moves very quickly and in a zigzag pattern. The time was about 3am Colorado time. I was unable to sleep, and decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette. We have these reclining chares in our back yard, so I laid down on one and looked up into the sky. I was not thinking about anything special, the usual pressures of life. It was a nice dark, clear night. As I was gazing towards the heavens, I noticed this red dot. I estimate its height in the sky between 20 to 30 miles up. The reason I estimate its height, is due to the size of the object. I can only compare it to, looking at a laser pointer dot, 30 feet away. While I was staring at this object, I did nothing unusual, at first I had thought it was a twinkling red star. Then the dot began to move. The dot moved slowly vertical, from it's position. I estimate, about 1 mile. Then the dot stopped. The dot stayed stationary for about 5 seconds then moved at a 90-degree angle, and stopped again. After about 5 seconds the dot moved again, zig zagging at an incredible speed, in a northern direction. The dot stopped suddenly, zig zagged backwards for about 5 seconds, then stopped for about 3 seconds, and moved strait up, and disappeared ((NUFORC Note:  Please see reports from Pennsylvania for this date.

Bright white object in Littleton, CO;2005-11-09 05:25:00;3 seconds;Bright white object in Littleton, CO brilliant white in color.  Flying parallel to the ground.  Height was hard to tell it was dark and I didn't have a point of reference, but if I had to say, it was no higher than a helicopter would fly.  It bobbed violently towards the ground, then back up again and disappeared.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
