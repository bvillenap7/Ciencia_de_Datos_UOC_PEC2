Blue Light Ball Thing followed by fire  or spark streaks, west of Highlands Ranch, Colorado.;2000-05-26 22:50:00;A few seconds;Blue Light Ball Thing followed by fire  or spark streaks, west of Highlands Ranch, Colorado. I'm a 25 year old Male.  I'm a professional computer geek doing I.T. and website design. I was outside walking to the house from my car and noticed the sky light up.  It was a bright blueish light followed by a trail of orange sparks or fire.  It lasted just for a few seconds, and I paused and listened expecting an explosion as whatever it was hit the ground.  I'm near C-470 and Lucent Blvd and this was to the West of me, possibly over the mountains. At 10 pm, our local news had a story about the Space shuttle so I went to nasa's site and saw that the landing wasn't until the 29th so that ruled that out.  I went to Art Bell's site to find your number/website and saw the Iridium satellite flare page, looked up the flares for the day and ruled that out as well. Whatever it was, it sure looked like it could have been low in altitude.  Like I said, I was waiting to hear a crash.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
On April 20, 2007, at approx. 10:00 PM, blueish fireball descends low near downtown Littleton, CO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??  PD));2007-04-20 22:00:00;4 seconds;On April 20, 2007, at approx. 10:00 PM, blueish fireball descends low near downtown Littleton, Colorado. We live in a west facing home in Littleton, Colorado near historic Old Downtown.  On the evening of April 20, 2007, a light caught my eye above the shutters of our living room window. My split second reaction was that it was a plane or helicopter since the light was the right size, color and distance.  However, it was moving quickly at a downward angle so my second thought was a plane or helicopter crashing.  I moved quickly to the window and watched the blueish fireball descend behind the trees.  It was large enough and low enough in a highly populated area that I expected to hear a boom or sirens afterward but haven't heard any reports.  My husband was with me at the time and even though I startled him with my reaction, he missed it.  This all took about 3 to 4 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor, we suspect.
