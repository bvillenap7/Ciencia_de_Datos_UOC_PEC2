I and my brother in-lam where playing frisbee at clement park. There must have been 200-500 people in the park that day with soccer games going on and other activities. I looked straight for no reason and noticed a white dot way up in the sky. Few seconds later a black dot was fly around the white dot for a few minutes. Then all of the sudden we lost track of the objects. From the north we saw a black disc clear as day come over raccoon creek golf course- Jefferson apartment complex. It moved slowly across bowles maybe a 100 feet of the ground, it was almost like you could reach out and touck it. It looked like a lightning blot was shooting out the botom of the craft contained in a large vacuum tube. It moved southwest across the park over wadsworth. I'm surprised cars weren't skidding off the road. The whole time I and my brother in-law are saying to each other are you seeing what I'm seeing. Both of us comfirm what we saw. Then its like we came too, and found nobody else in the park. It's like they all vanished, or we lost 2-3 hrs of time. We didn't remember the event for about 2-3 months. This is the first time that I have posted anything on the internet about the unbelieveable event that day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Daytime disk flying in stormy Denver weather;2002-08-29 15:00:00;2 minutes;Daytime disk flying in stormy Denver weather I am in sales and have a great view of the sky outside my window.  At this time, there is a storm blowing through the Denver metro area.  I just walked outside to the south of my building to watch the clouds churning, looked up to the southwest, and I saw a dark circular object -- almost like a child's helium balloon -- sort of hovering and drifting toward the north.  I was surprised at how slow it moved because the wind was pretty strong.  It was at this point about 1/2 to 3/4 mile away. I watched for a few seconds and could tell it wasn't a balloon, and it went out of sight around the corner of my building, so I ran through the building to the other side and caught sight of it again.  By this time it was a disk shape, more elongated, still dark in colour, and flying a bit faster toward the north.  It suddenly slowed down, then wobbled and went slightly sideways, and at that point it changed to more of a white colour briefly, then it tilted back to a horizontal position and started moving again to the north. I ran inside and yelled to some CSRs (who were just 15 feet inside the door), Come tell me if this isn't a flying saucer! and they all 4 ran out.  One of them could also see it, but the other 3 couldn't.  It was flying rapidly to the north, seeming to fly faster all the time.  It was still an elongated dark object.  We watched it for a few seconds until it disappeared.  It was moving from SW to N/NE.  When I first saw it, it was probably about 1/2 to 1 mile away, and by the time the CSR saw it it was still about 1 mile away but was travelling to the west of our building, toward the north.

I looked up, and just above the roof of the strip mall, a couple miles up in the sky, I seen this disc shaped thing hovering.  I kept walking along the back of the strip mall staring at it and it started to move in the same direction I was going.  It fallowed my direction for a couple seconds then it took off very fast away from me. When it was flying, it didn't make a sound.  I watched it untill it looked like a little ball flying in the distance. When it got that far away it swerved off to the left and flew that way for a couple seconds then disapeared.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
White disc flying over south Denver metro area;2003-08-04 12:20:00;30 seconds;White disc flying over south Denver metro area Seeing UFOs from my office window happens frequently.  About an hour ago, I was on the phone with a client, and looking at the western sky.  From above a bank of clouds comes a bright white, flattened oval -- not an airliner, but a disk shape -- flying in a path that would bring it directly overhead.  The object was about 1/8th of an inch wide at arm's length.  My best guess is that it was flying at at altitude of about 10,000 to 15,000 feet, with a speed of perhaps 200 to 300 MPH -- similar to a jet.  It was elongated to the left and right sides with no fuselage.  I watched it for a few seconds to try and determine what it was, and decided to ask my client if I could call her back in a few minutes.  Outside a few seconds later, I never caught sight of it again.  It was partly cloudy with much blue sky overhead, so I was surprised (and disappointed) when I couldn't find it.;39.5770400742115;-105.02146864564
Saucer spotted flying over 4 witnesses;2004-06-16 01:00:00;10 seconds;Saucer spotted flying over 4 witnesses During the summer of 2004 myself and 3 friends stayed the night at my house.  It was a warm night so we decided to grab some blankets and pillows and sleep on the tramp.  We were in eigth grade at the time so it was easy for all of to sleep on the tramp.  It was a clear night and we were all enjoying looking up at the stars, pointing out patterns, spotting satelites, and even a shooting star.  As we all sat gazing for the next object to spot, a saucer like object with multiple lights on it flew over head. We watched it fly for about 10 seconds and it was gone.  Immediately following the incedent we all turned to each other in amazement asking if we had seen the object.  It was definetly an UFO. It moved quickly and silently through the air drawing little attention.  The object was fairly close and appeared larger then an airplane.  We could definetly clearly see the shape of the object and that it was nothing man made.  Myself, my brother, and two best friends all witnessed and described the same exact object.  Being so young at the time we didnt do much about it.  Recently after watching UFO Hunters on the History Channel I decided to send in my case.

I witnessed a shadowy disk in the afternoon sky and also have a photo of a the disk in early morning.;2011-04-16 05:30:00;2 seconds;I witnessed a shadowy disk in the afternoon sky and also have a photo of a the disk in early morning. Between April 15 and April 18, I was sitting on my deck looking up at the sky, watching three hawks circle high and higher in the sky.  They got close to the clouds toward the west and the clouds parted and I saw briefly what looked like a huge shadowy disk.  It didn’t seem to have much substance to it, just shadowy.  It was big enough to contain 50 full moons.  The clouds and the sun moved back over and I lost sight of it.  It was really strange.  I only was able to see it a few seconds. The morning of the full moon (April 18)  I took a picture of the moon setting over the mountains and when I uploaded it to my computer and looked at the picture there was the same looking huge disk, about 1:00 o’clock two inches (on the photo) above the full  moon, still very shadowy looking.  You have to move the screen on the computer to be able to see it. I remember watching Star Trek and it reminded me of something that was being cloaked I certainly can’t explain it but I saw what I saw and the photo captured disk.

Summary Description: Silver Disk Seen During Daylight in CO,  Moves at inhuman speed.;2018-08-25 16:30:00;90 seconds;My boyfriend and I are avid believers and reasearchers of extra-terrestrial and paranormal phenomenons.  As we were driving to my parents house (on C470 in Littleton, CO) we got stuck in minor traffic. We were having a mundane conversation, unsuspectingly both looking North East up at the sky, when suddenly, we looked at each other with bewildered eyes and said, together, Did you see that?!?. We had both witnessed one(1) gray/silver disk in the sky (while it was still light out) just sitting above us.  It didn't move or have any flickering/blinking/flashing lights.  We'd both stared at it for a minute while talking and sitting in traffic, and watched it zip away and disappear, after another 30 seconds of no profound movement, towards the North faster than anything either of us had seen before. (There was no box for my Summary Description so I hope it's okay for me to add it onto the end of this box)   Summary Description: Silver Disk Seen During Daylight in CO,  Moves at Inhuman speed.
