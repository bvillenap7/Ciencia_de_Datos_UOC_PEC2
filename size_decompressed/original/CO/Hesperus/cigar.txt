large, low flying object with two lights flying east over Hesperus, Co.;2003-12-18 09:30:00;15 minutes;large, low flying object with two lights flying east over Hesperus, Co. We live in a rural area and the local airport is so small it does not have a tower.  The largest planes that leave or come to this area are 'hopper' planes, which holds maybe 25-30 people.  At about 9:30 tonight my husband and I heard a loud noise which brought us running outside.  Unfortunately, our eyes were not adjusted to the dark so we could not see the body of the object, which seemed to be cigar shaped.  It was just over our house when we got outside and was very low to the ground, maybe 200 feet in the air.  There were two lights (reg. airplane sized) one above the other slightly tilted with the upper light being forward in the direction it was moving.  It turned very slowly so that the lights were eventually horizontal to one another.  It was much too large to be a helicopter.  I would say the size was about that of a large passenger plane.  However, it did not sound like a passenger plane nor could one fly this slowly.  I had enough time to run into the house get the binoculars, turn off all of the lights and still watched it for another 10 minutes.  It seemed to hover over the mountain for about 5 of those minutes.  There was another small white light near it while it was hovering, and I thought it to be a small airplane.  (but now wish I'd given more thought to it while watching) It then seemed to land, but it may have just gone over the mountain and out of my line of view.  My husband is a mechanical engineer and has studied and understands aircraft, he had no idea what this was....;37.1654;-108.1219
