Similar to report from Longmont CO on 9/7/98.Very fast moving light;1998-08-22 20:00:00;3 seconds;Similar to report from Longmont CO on 9/7/98.Very fast moving light While camping in the Lizard Head Wilderness Area near Telluride CO I saw a light move across 2/3 of the sky in approx. 2 seconds. I've watched satellites and meteor showers. This moved MUCH faster. It was a constant white light with a brightness greater than any star or planet. It moved from the WSW horizon to the NE horizon in a straight line(arc). Like the gentleman in Longmont, I thought I was imagining it. I couldn't believe its speed, and replayed it in my mind several times to get a grasp on the speed at which it must have moved.I still think it's possible it might have been a low orit satellite since sunset was only a couple of hours before the event. I took a photograph of star trails that night in a 2 hour exposure. Unfortunately the shutter was not open during this event.;37.9408;-107.8243
White star-like light wobbled as it got closer to me, then it was scared away by 5-6 F-15s that scoured the area for hours afterwards.;2002-08-09 22:30:00;Half hour;((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from same source for locations in Arizona and Colorado.  PD)) White star-like light wobbled as it got closer to me, then it was scared away by 5-6 F-15s that scoured the area for hours afterwards. Camping at Alta Lakes, south of Telluride, CO (a 11,300 foot high lake on the continental divide, San Juan Mts.) Saw a white light with intensity twice that of a star. GPS coordinates of it's approximate location: 108.05 by 37.55. Since I camp all the time, and see things all the time, my first action was to see if it was just a planet, since Venus was out at the time. So I lined it up between two big trees that didn't move in the wind. It definately wobbled as it got closer to me. It was like it was trying to maintain it's position relative to me as it got closer so I wouldn't notice. I paniced and shuffled things into sleep mode, where I can hide locked up in the back of my truck with my .44 Magnum next to me, when all of a sudden three F-15s soared past me about 700 MPH. Two were on the other side of where it was, criss-crossing the area. I looked, and the light was gone. At least five F-15s (a couple could have been F-16s), scoured the area for over an hour after that. I thought I saw what looked like two orange lights comoing out of one, like it was shooting it's guns. Then I went to sleep and nothing else happened. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source.  Note:  If F-15's, or any other plane, flies by a witness at 700 mph, it is not a roar.  Rather, it would sound like a huge explosion (actually, two explosions), since the craft would be supersonic at that velocity.  There are a few questions we have about this report we would like to resolve.  PD));37.9408;-107.8243
