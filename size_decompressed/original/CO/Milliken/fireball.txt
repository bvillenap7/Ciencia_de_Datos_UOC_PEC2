Light orange/white/yellow 'Fireball' sighting in Milliken, CO.;2016-05-27 23:52:00;1 minute;Light orange/white/yellow 'Fireball' sighting in Milliken, CO. At 2352 hrs. on Friday 28 May, 2016, my friend and myself were traveling southbound on Highway 257 towards the town of Milliken.  The terrain drops in elevation as you approach the town, which affords a wide view of the horizon. As we turned the slight bend during the elevation drop, we both immediately noticed a bright light orange/white burst of light approximately 60 degrees above the horizon.  I initially thought the object was a commercial aircraft making a maneuver towards Denver International Airport, as this location is in the flight path of the airport. After the initial burst of light, the ‘fireball’ appeared to dim slightly while changing to a yellow color.  At this point the object began to descend and hover lower above the horizon. It then moved in the sky irregularly up and down before regaining a higher altitude.  During the entire sighting the light pattern flickered at an irregular rate with varying intensity.  After approximately sixty seconds, the object was out of our line of sight and appeared to disappear from its original sighting location. This sighting seems to be similar to the other ‘fireball’ sightings occurring over the last four years as regularly reported by NUFORC.;40.332;-104.8538
