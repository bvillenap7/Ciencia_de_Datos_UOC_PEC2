They had been in a triangle formation with 1 in top 2 on bottom and the closer I got the more the triangle disbursed (or got bigger.)   I was going to continue straightening as to see what this object was but the closer I got they disappeared.   I wasnâ€™t able to spot them from my home which faces west.  I did capture 2 pictures as I was driving.  I was hoping to find others on this site who witness the same thing;40.332;-104.8538
