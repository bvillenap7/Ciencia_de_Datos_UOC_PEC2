Bright, Flying Lights Near Milliken, CO;2008-05-21 23:05:00;10 seconds;Bright, Flying Lights Near Milliken, CO At approximately 11:05 p.m. on May 31, 2008, me, my husband and two kids were traveling North on Highway 60 towards Milliken, Colorado.  We were about 3 to 4 miles North of Highway 85 when my husband said, what the heck is that?  I looked to my left and noticed a bright, flashing light.  I was stunned by the light and initially thought it was some type of a light from the field we were driving by, but then it started moving and it was apparent it was no stationary light.  It was pretty low to the ground, only a bit above the tall trees in the area. The flying, flashing light passed us on the left, I watched it fly out of sight which only took about 5 seconds.  It was moving at a really fast speed.  As I was watching the first flashing light move out of sight, I noticed a  second one passing us as well.  I watched it until it disappeared out of sight in about the same amount of time.  Both flying, flashing lights headed South in the direction of Highway 85. All I could see was the flashing light, that looked like a ball shape to me.  It is hard to put a size to them, but compared to the moon, they were a lot smaller and were both the same size. I heard no sound from them, we however were driving in the car. I have never seen anything like it and my husband and I were stunned after they flew by wondering what the heck these things could have been.;40.332;-104.8538
Bright, Flashing Flying Light Near Milliken, CO;2008-05-31 23:05:00;10 seconds;Bright, Flashing Flying Light Near Milliken, CO At approximately 11:05 p.m. on May 31, 2008, I was driving North on Highway 60 towards Milliken, Colorado.  I was about 3 to 4 miles North of Highway 85 when I saw an intense flashing light to the left of the road, about 100 feet in the air.  The flying light was flashing from a less intense light to a really bright light and did not appear to be moving.  But after watching it a couple of seconds, it appeared to start moving towards me.  I asked my wife, What the heck is that?   We both watched it approach and pass very quickly to our left, still in the air.  I was looking forward trying to drive and looking back trying to watch the object.  After it had passed us, I noticed another flying, flashing bright light which appeared to be going the same direction as the first flying, flashing bright light.  Both objects moved quickly in the direction of Highway 85 and disappeared out of sight within a matter of 6 seconds.  I could not put a size to it because there was no shape to it, just a bright flashing light.  I do not remember ever seeing that intense of a light at night before.  The entire time I saw the objects was only about 10 seconds.;40.332;-104.8538
