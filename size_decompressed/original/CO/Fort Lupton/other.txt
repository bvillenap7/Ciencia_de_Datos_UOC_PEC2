Very strange, very fast flying object near Boulder Colorado;2007-08-15 14:00:00;2-3 minutes;Very strange, very fast flying object near Boulder Colorado   Traveling west on CR 50, we observed a flying object also heading west.   When first noticed it seemed to have just  taken off from the ground and was gaining height rapidly.  It levelled off at about 100 feet from the ground and seemed to be picking up speed.   It banked suddenly away from us, then banked again to a straighter course, then gained more height and speed very rapidly.   We're both experienced observers of aircraft and the forward speed and altitude gain far surpassed any light, small vehicle we've ever seen or heard of.   Within seconds the object was moving at well over 100 MPH (gauging by our own speed on the road).  We observed it while it travelled away from us at great speed, then disappeared from view several miles to the north and at least a mile above us, gauging by its visual size. It was very hard to tell how large the object was and whether it was manned due to its speed.  The closest description we can give is of some kind of very small ultralight flying machine that seemed to be constructed of just very thin metal bars.   The shape was of a completely stripped down vertical metal piece with one cross piece.  The ends of the cross piece seemed to have flanges, but it was hard to tell as it was banking, rising, and gaining speed very rapidly.  It couldn't possibly have been a radio-controlled toy and there didn't seem to be anywhere for a person to be sitting.   Could this be a small military drone?;40.1077;-104.8107
