3 lights moving in perfect Triangle formation across the sky in Ouray County, Colorado on August 4, 2003;2003-08-04 22:45:00;3 minutes;3 lights moving in perfect Triangle formation across the sky in Ouray County, Colorado on August 4, 2003 We were camping in Ouray Colorado - sitting by the embers of a fire, watching the stars when I saw 3 lights - that looked like stars moving from the North.  They were moving in formation - a triangle shape with the head light in the front - forming the tip of the triangle.  The other two lights were spread out behind the first one to form a perfect triangle.  They were quite high up, like I said they appeared at first to be stars - but upon seeing them moving in sync we realized they were not.  If they were a color I would have to describe them as slightly Bluish.  The four of us watched them (myself, my boyfriend and my two oldest sons: 16 & 13) as they moved out of sight.  After that we were very excited and watched the sky carefully.  We also saw a light moving across the sky that appeared to change color from White to Red, Red to White.  It moved fairly quickly in the opposite direction of the other formation.;38.0278;-107.6733
