UFO in Buena Vista, Colorado;2008-05-17 10:19:00;~10 sec.;UFO in Buena Vista, Colorado During a daily walk, there was an object floating above a rock formation to the North.  It was spherical, looked metallic (which could be the cause of a change in color), and was approximately Â¼ of a centimeter in the sky from the observed position.  The prediction was that it was just a plane far away, although the planes at this altitude often have trails (as compared with many other planes in the sky at the time).   After keeping watch on it for between 10 and 15 seconds, the object had hovered, started flying (to fast for a plane) and disappeared behind a wisp of cloud no bigger than a finger nail when held to the sky.  After watching that area of the sky intensely  for 5 minutes, the object never came out the other side of the cloud.;38.830028;-106.14436
