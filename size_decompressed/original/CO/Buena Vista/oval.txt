White oval with gold light/energy over mountain in daylight;1997-03-15 10:30:00;10 mins;White oval with gold light/energy over mountain in daylight It was a clear day and my girlfriend and I were letting our dogs run around the rodeo grounds near Buena Vista Co. This is in a valley with 12 to 14 thousand foot mountains running North-South. The Collegic Peaks were south of us, also near Mt. Antero.  Looking northeast from rodeo ground right above mtn. peak was a white oval shaped object hovering stationary.  It was approximately a couple miles away and perhaps 2-3 times bigger than a goodyear blimp. It was white, oval shaped.  I had binoculars in the car and so used them for a better look. I could get the peak of the mountain in focus but the object remained a bit fuzzy with a gold light shimmering inside of it. This was as if it was emitting some sort of energy or field around it that sort of distorted (like heat waves).  However it was still clear enough to watch for about ten minutes w/ binoc's and w/out.  Closest thing it could have been was a blimp, but of course wasn't in this remote location. It then just vanished no trail, trace, anything just poof- gone like into another dimesion or something. remember clear daylight 10-11am or so. not typical saucer or round sphere-OVAL and just vanished.
