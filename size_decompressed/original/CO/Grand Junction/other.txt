Witnessed a craft moving southeast across the sky at a high rate of speed.  It was shaped sort of like a cresent moon, with the convex edge leading. It has an orange glow, and appeared to be hazy, as if to say it was hard to see hard lines in it.   It moved incredibly quick, and twice entered into an s curve as it followed its trajectory.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
