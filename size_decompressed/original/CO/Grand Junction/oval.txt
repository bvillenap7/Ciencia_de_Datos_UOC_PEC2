Unexplainable glowing craft moving oddly over the Grand Junction Airport;2008-04-16 23:00:00;5-7 mins;Unexplainable glowing craft moving oddly over the Grand Junction Airport My three friends and I were enjoyig a few cigars on an abandoned dirt road a bit south-west of the Grand Junction Airport. My good friend sitting to my right in the back seat of the jeep (My other two friends were in the driver and passenger seats) had pointed out seeing a light in the sky doing some strange things. We all watched the light for a minute or two and after seeing that it was moving in a pretty regular pattern to the south we passed it off as a plane. As my other three friends continued to talk I continued to watch this light, I noticed that it was an oval shaped light and had changed direction, it was now moving exactly on the same path, but in a different direction, then it stopped... moved vertically upward... stopped... moved in a diagonal direction, and started moving south again. I had at this point told my friends to take a second look at the light and we were all baffled as it repeated its strange movements, the strangest patterns were the perfectly verticle upward and downward motions of the light, and it was close enough to see that it was not a plane, or a car driving with its headlights on over the mountains. After two or three minutes it settled back downward slowly out of sight to the hills near the Grand Junction Airport. With 4 whitnesses as equally sane as I am I cannot begin to explain this light. But we were all very shaken and disturbed for the rest of the night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
White oval drops out of black storm clouds.;2019-04-03 12:40:00;30-40 seconds;White oval drops out of black storm clouds. Witnessed a very white oval drop down out of the clouds.  Clouds are very dark rain clouds.  Oval stopped and hovered for approximately 5 seconds, then moved north for 10 seconds.  Stopped then moved east about 5 seconds.   Without stopping immediately moved back to the west 5 seconds.  Stopped and hovered for 10 to 15 seconds, then went directly vertical back up into the clouds.   The oval was very precise in movement when changing direction it made a very clean 90-degree turn.  No corner turns just 90 degrees at every turn.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
