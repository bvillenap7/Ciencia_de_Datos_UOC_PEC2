first object was huge second much smaller both chased by fighter jets.;2004-09-16 19:15:00;15 min;first object was huge second much smaller both chased by fighter jets. I was hunting and just as the sun was going down I looked at the horizon and noticed two airliners reflection from the setting sun.The date was 9/16/04 at approxamently 7:15pm.As I was looking at the airliners I realized I was looking at another reflection that was higher than the airliners and seemed closer but I think it was as far if not farther than the airliners.This object was huge, looking through my binoculers it did not seem to have a definet solid appearance but was flat with a slight dome shape to it and moveing at about the same speed as the airliners.In cmpareison in size to the airliners the airliners would have made a small dot on the object it looked that big.At this time I was trying to understand what I was seeing when a jet fighter banked over Grand Junction.When I looked at the fighter I saw 2 more fighters higher up and none where in any kind of formation.The fighter that banked over GJ got on a straight course towards the huge object and hit his after burners flying west the other fighters did not follow.I watched this pursuit and the huge object just faded out,if I had to guess this happened closer to Green River UT.I kept watching the horizon after the huge object dissapeared and saw on the horizon a much smaller object holding in the sme spot.I thought this was a star but then another fighter flew over GJ heading directly for this object as the fighter grew closer this object dissapered like turning off a light.All this took place in 15 min.And ther was not a cloud in the sky and I never saw the third again.

A large-seeming camouflaged saucer rotating on an axis;2016-11-24 03:00:00;30 seconds;A large-seeming camouflaged saucer rotating on an axis I was sitting out on my porch when I saw something moving through the trees out by the road a thousand or so yards down and I dismissed it as an owl or something.  But as it emerged from obscurity I could tell that this was a large, spherical entity, rotating on an axis somehow.  The strange thing was that it seemed to be under the veil of some sort of camouflage, though since it was rotating on an axis it was easily identifiable.  I have included another report from later on in the week (last night) regarding a seemingly different type of UFO encounter in the same area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
((HOAX??))  Mental contact made with ufo.;2017-07-16 15:00:00;3 minutes;Mental contact made with ufo I was sitting in my backyard, enjoying the afternoon.  Something caught my eye.  A white object was up in the sky, I thought it was a commercial aircraft, but it was flying way too slow.  It was traveling in a straight line.  I've had ufo sightings before.  So I stood up and stared at it, and I was going to try and make mental contact with this craft.  So I stared at it and directed these thoughts at it.  You make no exhaust you make no sound you are moving way to slow you have no wings what are you?  After I sent these thoughts to the this craft, It began to act differently.  It was going in a straight line.  It was white.  It was sort of rectangular, but it was curved on top of the craft and below.  It morphed a tiny bit, then after it received my thoughts, it began to flicker in and out of this reality.  It did this four times, then it completely vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  HOAX.  Witness provides contact information which is bogus.  We seriously question whether it is a serious report.  PD));39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
Mental contact made with ufo but with a negative  response;2017-07-22 19:00:00;4 minutes;Mental contact made with ufo but with a negative  response Hello.  This is a p.s. to what I wrote to you on the 16th.  On the 22nd I saw two of the same craft that I saw on the 16th.  They were one minute apart.  They were both white and traveling in a straight line.  They were rectangular shaped but with a curved top and bottom.  I decided again to make mental contact with it.   The first craft was just like the one on the 16th. I stared at it while it was moving and directed this one thought at it, what are you?  It just kept slowly moving and didn't disappear.   A second one soon showed up.  It was flying just like the others, it made no noise, no exhaust and had no wings and flew very slow. I sent another thought at it what are you.  Then I watched it fly out of sight.   I then went inside my home and my sight was now strange.  When I looked at anything of a light color, my eyes began to flicker-On and off very fast.  It was light that I saw whenever I looked a light colored object.  This lasted for six minutes, then stopped.  I'll never try to make mental contact with a unidentified object again.  I view that vision problem as some type of retaliation for the thoughts I sent to all three craft.       Anonymous;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
