Cluster of UFO's seen over Grand Junction, CO.;2014-09-13 20:45:00;3-5 minutes;Cluster of UFO's seen over Grand Junction, CO. I was sitting on the patio of the Grand Vista Hotel in Grand Junction, Colorado around 8:45 pm with my Aunt and her friend.  Her friend interrupted our conversation and pointed out there were strange lights in the sky facing SW of the hotel. I immediately pulled out my phone and started capturing what we were seeing. I had seen the recent reports with similar descriptions and the red color we first noticed. There were at least 15 spheres moving together and changing color from red to a brighter almost yellow gold color.  Some were breaking off and forming triangle formations.  I took off running on Horizon Dr heading West. I was capturing these objects and talking to people near by alerting them to look at these lights in the sky above. A few thought they were Chinese Lanterns that were launched, but being so close to the airport and freeway it seemed like it would be a dangerous thing to do. I e-mailed the Bookcliff Country Club GM on the 14th inquiring if they had hosted a party that may have launched some Chinese Lanterns.  I have not heard anything back. In my opinion they did not resemble or move like Chinese Lanterns would have and they match similar recent reports, including the UFOs over Olympia, WA.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
Orange sphere with beams of light emanating from it.;2014-12-15 01:20:00;3-5 minutes;Orange sphere with beams of light emanating from it I work nights and left on a break to a local supermarket.  Upon my return to my place of employment, I parked in the back of the building where I always do. I saw a large orange spherical shape that was emitting beams of light.  I got out of my car to get a better look and determined that it could not have been a helicopter (I work near St. Mary’s Hospital), nor could it have been an airplane because they do not emit light in a circle.  I was facing north and the sphere traveled from west to east at a steady, smooth, fast pace.  It did not have a tail and it did not trend downward.  The farther away it traveled, it seemed to trend upward. I did get my phone and thought I was recording it when it was close but then realized that it was not recording until it was farther away.  I did get a recording of this when it was farther away and I can’t figure out how to send it in an email.  It says the file is too big but the video is only for 30 seconds.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
