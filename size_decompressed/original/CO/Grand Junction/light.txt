Four red lights slowly moving, high above.;2014-01-17 08:30:00;30 minutes;Four red lights slowly moving, high above. Walking outside tonight my mother called and ask if I noticed the red lights toward the south.  They were red and kinda blue slowly blinking but not moving.  They were high in the sky.  Seemed to have four lights but could not see what they were attached to. Checking now it has seemed to moved a little higher.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
