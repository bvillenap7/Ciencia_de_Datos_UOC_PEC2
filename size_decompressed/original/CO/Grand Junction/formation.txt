Maybe the rapture ? Hopefully not an invasion they were headed in the direction of albequerque new mexii don't believe in extra terrestrial invasions but I do think someone should call the base in slb or at least be watching I I don't know where they would land here to many for the mountains;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
