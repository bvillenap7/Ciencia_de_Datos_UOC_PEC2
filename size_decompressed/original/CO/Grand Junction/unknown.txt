I observed it for several minuets .   I  then seen it turn to the  north . I called my two brothers out and they saw it too.  It was going at a fast rate of speed about 1000 mph. I went in to the house and  got  a pair of binoculars. I went into the back yard and by the time I could find it, it was almost out of sight. There were no flashing lights, at the same time that we saw this there were at least three airplanes in the night sky and we could see their lights flashing.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
Rumbling red light in the sky with a bluish-purple tail moving very fast and changing direction instantaneously.;2009-09-02 20:50:00;1 minute;Rumbling red light in the sky with a bluish-purple tail moving very fast and changing direction instantaneously. I was looking at the stars and heard a subdued, very deep, low rumble. My eyes scanned for where it was coming from and I found something in the Southern sky approximately 20 degrees from the plain of the horizon.  The object appeared to be moving West at a high rate of speed, in an instant it was moving East at a similar speed. It was a red dot bluish-purple hue emanating from the back of it.  The object then jutted back in a Western direction for a moment followed yet another direction change which appeared to be straight up for about 5 seconds, then West again. After this the rumble disappeared and it circled South-East and I lost it behind some trees.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509

No lights, quiet, hovering & stationary.;2012-10-24 21:30:00;5 minutes;No lights, quiet, hovering & stationary. I was outside of a movie theater with two friends when I looked east toward the middle of the parking lot to witness what appeared to be a vague yet solid bodied object floating above.  No illuminations, just simply hovering without a sound.  From the lights reflecting off the parking lot, me and two friends were able to identify there was something above the eparking lot.  The lights from the parking lot made it hard to see but I could only identify it to be about the size of an suv and hovering in our immediate location.  We marveled and went into the theater.  In duration we watched it for about five minutes I walked closer and around to get a better view but could only see, effectively the underside of something.  It was stationary in the sky the whole time.  It was gone after the movie.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
Bright orange glow illuminating south Douglas Pass north of grand Junction, CO.;2013-12-30 01:00:00;30 minutes;bright orange glow illuminating south Douglas Pass north of grand Junction CO Early morning Dec 29, 2013 driving on hwy 139 heading south over Douglas pass and before we got to top I commented to my companion that it was beautiful as the sky was an orange color and illuminated the skyline with trees and mountain tops,   once we were on top we saw two separate lit up areas on top of ridges the one farther away was much brighter but both were deep orange also as we started up Douglas it was snowing but the sky was clear..  as neither of us are very familiar with area we took note of the glowing lights but only realized what we may have saw because of a group of about 15 sheriff and I assume undercover vehicles were at bottom of the south side of Douglas pass and had what appeared to be an antenne with a green light on top about 30 feet in the air as we continued down we stopped to look back to see if we could see what the lights were about but we saw nothing but black sky not even a glow in the canyon.

Strange high-pitched frequencies and a beam of electric light going downwards diagonally before quickly vanishing.;2016-11-28 00:00:00;1 minute;Strange high-pitched frequencies and a beam of electric light going downwards diagonally before quickly vanishing. Me and the other witness were going out to smoke some cigarettes and everything was muffled under the first snowfall of the year.  After a few smokes we began to hear these bizarre, high-pitched noises.  I mean, the noises we were hearing were otherworldly.  Witness 2 is a bird-watcher and says there is nothing like that in nature (not to mention our nature is pretty limited in this town).  If I could compare the noise to anything it would be a zipline made of electricity.  There were two of the same noises, each which lasted about half a second yet created a distinct Doppler effect.  When me and my friend slowly went outside to see what the hell was going on there were birds flying from the direction of the noise (in a dead, snowy night) we could tell that the noises were almost communicating with each other.  Then all of a sudden the noises came again and the most ridiculous thing in my life.  At the moment they made the final noise there was this streak of electricity moving faster than I've seen anything move yet trailing a tail of what in the brief time I could see it appeared to be electricity.  So naturally at first I attributed it to something hitting a telephone wire or something.  But when I walked further out to get a view I realized there never was and never has been a telephone pole in that direction for a long ways.  The closest one is strung along the opposite direction.  I have not believed in anything UFO related up until this point, but this is the second encounter I've had this week. I'm actually wary of publicizing it on here but I will include it in another report since it was almost a week prior from this and the 2nd witness involved was not present.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
