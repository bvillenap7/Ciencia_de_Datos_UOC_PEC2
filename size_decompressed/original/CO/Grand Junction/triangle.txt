I woke up at 4:20 AM to go to the bathroom and have a cigarette outside and when I stepped out onto the back porch I saw an amber light attached to a triangle in the sky. It went back-and-forth really slow. I didn’t have my phone on me so I ran back inside the house to get it and when I came back outside it was still there and I was shaking so bad that I had to set my phone on the outside table to study the focus of what I was trying to record. I was in disbelief and the hairs on my head or standing up. There was no sound. When I hit record on my phone my phone made the object look circular in shape. I placed my phone on the table as steady as I could and hit record insight move back and forth up and down. Towards the end it took off to the right so fast it’s like it disappeared into thin air. I’m here visiting my sister in Grand Junction Colorado And this is the most Crazy thing I’ve ever seen in my life. I have a video and a picture of what I saw.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
