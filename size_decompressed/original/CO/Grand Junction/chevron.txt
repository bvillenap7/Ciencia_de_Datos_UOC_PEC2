U.F.O. zips across sky at incredible rate of speed, HUGE and very high in the sky Western Colorado.;2010-09-17 13:00:00;20 seconds;U.F.O. zips across sky at incredible rate of speed, HUGE and very high in the sky Western Colorado. My wife and I were lying in the grass watching the sky and we saw a dark object pass from the South heading North/ This object was traveling at an amazing speed, zipping across the sky and disappearing into the horizon within 15 seconds, appeared to be very very high altitude yet extremely LARGE in size.  This object made no noise at all, no trail or anything else you would expect from an aircraft.  We know the differance between commercial, military aircraft flying through the sky high or low, fast or slow but this was truly something of its own and amazing!  It was a dark color, grey or blakish.  Chevron or triangle shape.;39.0925074550128;-108.56945218509
