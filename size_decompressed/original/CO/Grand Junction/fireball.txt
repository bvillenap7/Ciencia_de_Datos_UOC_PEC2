It looked like a camp fire on the rear of the craft that was not affected by wind speed .the fire seemed to be like a normal camp fire in color and action with out the wind disturbance that should have been there.  This area is in the flight path to the airport I do not know if the air port tower could have seen it or picked it up on radar, my neighbor and his wife also saw the craft she ran into the house to get a camera but it was not in time to get a picture.
