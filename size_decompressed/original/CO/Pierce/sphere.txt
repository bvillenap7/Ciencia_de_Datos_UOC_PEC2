Dull grey spherical object  with black helicopter and military vehicles in Peirce Colorado.;2017-11-21 11:00:00;2 hours;Dull grey Spherical object  with black helicopter and military vehicles in Peirce Colorado. I was sitting in my living room and decided to open the front door for fresh air when I noticed a dull grey spherical shaped object slowly moveing through the sky about a mile away in a south western direction. There was no sound that I could hear comeing from the object. The object stopped abruptly in mid air, then zipped away super fast in a northern direction, there was no noise when this happened. I didnt see the object again after this time, however about an hour later my windows started rattling as a single bladed black helicopter that was flying sort of low made about 6 large clockwork circles over our town.  After about 10 minutes of this I started hearing a bunch of sirens coming north up highway 85 of which my home is about 1000 feet from.  I walked down our street to see what was going on when a convoy of about 15 to 20 tan armored military vehicles passed by.  There was one vehicle that was blue in the middle of the convoy that looked like some kind of truck with a camper like shell with a door on the back. The convoy where traveling at about 50 miles an hour maybe faster.  After the vehicles passed I saw the black helicopter make another pass between Pierce and Nunn before i lost sight of it.;40.6368;-104.7666
