big bright white dot;2003-05-21 21:30:00;10 minutes;@ 9:30PM May 21, 2003 Rifle, Colorado 	Me and my husband just seen what looked like a large star (or planet like Venus or Jupiter) moving slowly from the SW to the NE.  I ran and got my binoculars to see if there were any green or red lights , but there wasn’t any.  It was just a big bright white dot.  It never picked up speed, and it didn’t make any noise that we could hear.  It also seemed to be adjusting it’s direction, for it seemed (as I watched) to be making like a wide curve turn, and as it disappeared beyond the horizon it seemed like it was traveling more east then northeast.  We spotted it when it was over head, and it took about 10 minutes before we lost sight of it.;39.5507;-107.787
