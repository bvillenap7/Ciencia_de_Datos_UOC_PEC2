I thought, when I first spotted it, satellite.... space junk.... space station???.  I watched it for about a minute or so (it wasn't moving very fast)... then it slowly changed into a fairly nice dot of light... then the dot started getting smaller and smaller and smaller... till it finally vanished.  I thought... well... I don't think that was a satellite and etcetera, nor even a meteor.  It made me think as it vanished though, that it was like... flying away from earth(?);39.5507;-107.787
