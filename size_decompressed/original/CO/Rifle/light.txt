' Venus is setting now... it shouldn't be overhead at this time...'then it faded away very quickly... as though moving directly away into the night sky.

Two bright lights flying over rifle colorado;2009-07-24 21:45:00;2 min;Two bright lights flying over rifle colorado At approximately 2145 on 7-24-09 I witnessed a bright object overhead moving at a high rate of speed. The object was traveling east from Rifle, CO. The object did not have any flashing lights to indicate that it could be an aircraft. The object seemed to be changing direction in a serpentine type of pattern. It also appeared to be changing speeds accelerating and decelerating several times. I watched the object for approximately 45 seconds when it entered some clouds and I could no longer see it. I noticed a second object at that time that was further west and flying in the same direction as the other. This object appeared to be brighter and slightly bigger than the first. At this time I called my son who was in the house outside. I pointed out the object and we watched it until it also went into the clouds. Both objects were very bright white lights that were a round shape but no definite outline could be seen. No noise was heard from engines but they were ! flying at an unknown altitude approximately the same as the clouds this night.
