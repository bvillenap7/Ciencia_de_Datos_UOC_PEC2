Twice Looking SW Dillon we saw a campfire type glow, ascend and disappear to the east.  My son had just left and sure enough, he saw it too while up at the stoplight.  He filmed w/his phone, not good footage. I thought of an afterburner on a jet, ut it was silent. distances are hard to tell.  The light could have been dimming, not getting further away, says my wife.  The light kept getting smaller and faded away like a dim star. It happened twice about 5 minutes apart and lasted 3  or 4 minutes each.  We did not see them down below the mountainous horizon.;39.5952;-105.9741
