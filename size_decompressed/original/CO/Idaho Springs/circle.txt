Three circular lights appearing  as big as the moon on mountain top hovering in Idaho Springs, CO.;2004-03-31 03:00:00;2 Hours;Three circular lights appearing  as big as the moon on mountain top hovering in Idaho Springs, CO. I live on the front range of Denver,CO- In the city of Idaho Springs. I live on the side of the mountain. The street that I live on is at the highest point on the mountain side. That evening I woke up at 3AM. For reason's that most people over 50 get up for! I looked out the back door that faces the mountain--straight up where the mountain ends and the sky is seen(horizon) I saw three circular shaped lights. They were the size of the moon --each of them. The light being emitted from them was white just like the moon. At first I thought that the light I saw coming into the room from the window was the moon. Then looking out the window,,I noticed the three white lights--giving off as much light as the moon! I watched them for a while. They remained in place..never moving. At times the light would stop and then come back on again. Two of them remained next to each other. The other was spaced a little further away. But they were lined up in a row. Straight along the top of the mountain horizon approximately 14,000 ft. This is just a guess. I had gotten up again at about 5AM. They were still there in the same position and flashing on and off every once in a while. This was not the only time I have seen these objects. That particular week, four days in a row...but I can definately say I saw them on March 28,29,30,31. I hope that you will find this of some interest.
