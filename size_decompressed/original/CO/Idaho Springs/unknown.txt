bright lights stanley rd.;2006-09-26 21:00:00;2 min;bright lights stanley rd. i saw (i think) 4 bright white lights. they semed to be in a pretty staight line. i thought it was strange because normaly at night in this area you see planes and they have the normal red lights. the light caught my attention because they where so bright and they where moving so slowly. in this area there are alot of planes. i think the planes follow i-70. the lights just seemed to totaly disapear. at first i thought they just disapeared behind the ridge of the mountain. then i turned around and came back the same way. it didn't appear to me that it could have disapeared at that time due to the mountain. i have seen alot of stange stuff in the sky at different times in my life. this by far was the strangest and i can't seem to get it out of my mind. this all happened on stanley rd. outside of idaho springs. i was heading west. i lost sight of it  before the alma linclon mine which is .772 miles down stanley rd.
