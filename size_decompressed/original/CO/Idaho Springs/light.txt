Mass UFO sighting.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-24 21:45:00;15 minutes;Mass UFO sighting. I noticed a string of lights that resembled stars but they were in a straight line of 15-20 evenly spaced and then suddenly disappeared 1 after the other. Un know objects were very high in the sky and traveling SE as I was headed West @ Floyd hill on I70. I have seen a few videos one from Detroit of the exact thing I saw.
