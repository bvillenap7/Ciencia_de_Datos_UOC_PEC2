After watching the ball drop on TV, we went outside to celebrate with a few small fireworks.  First we saw a smaller orange looking fireball to the SE, moving NE across the horizon.  It streaked quickly across the horizon, then was gone.  2 or 3 minutes later, we saw a MUCH LARGER fireball, to the NE, moving NW across the horizon, then dissapearing.  We could see so much detail on this fireball:  It appeared to be a white/yellow glowing orb, with colorful tails streaming off it's sides and rear.  The tails were red, blue, and green.  We couldn't stop thinking & talking about it all night.  I was surprised to find not much collaboration on the internet.;38.8182;-105.5788
