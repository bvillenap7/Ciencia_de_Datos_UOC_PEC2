While visiting Colorado during the Perseid meteor shower, my family and I saw three lights moving in a triangular shaped formation across the sky in a south to north direction. The lights resembled stars or satellites moving, except that there were three moving in a constant triangle shape. There were no sounds and it wasn't one triangular shaped craft since when they moved across the sky we could see stars appear between the points of light. They moved quickly and they did not blink. The whole sighting took approximately five minutes before we lost view of them.;39.55035;-104.99195
Fast High altitude V Formation over Colorado day before 9/11 attacks;2001-09-10 22:30:00;5 to 10 seconds;Fast High altitude V Formation over Colorado day before 9/11 attacks I was setting up my Mead LX200 10 telescope on a clear night when I sat the scope on the tripod, I looked up and noticed a V formation of dim lights higher than an airliner and  lower than a satillite but much faster than either a plane or a satillite.  It was headed directly south towards the Air Force Acadamy in Colorado Springs which was 45 miles south of my location in Highlands Ranch.  There was no sound and the lights were not flashing, I was able to fllow it until it from straight up 90 degrees to where it was at about 45 degrees and it took 5 to 10 seconds.  The V was much larger than an aircraft or a satillite would be at that altitude and the lights were much dimmer than the Phoenix lights, they were almost grey like dim stars.  If I held my thumb out at arms length like in 'The Right Stuff' the formation was about one to one and a half thumbs wide.  This was the night before 9/11 which is why I remember the date so well, I thought maybe the visitors! were here to witness the events of 9/11. I made an computer animation of what I seen and reported it to MUFON but never heard back probably because 9/11 was succh a hectic time. My background: I am a Navy Veteran electronics data systems tech, my civilian background is engineering fiber optic outside plant networks and ROV electronics.  I do know what satillites look like and have introduced dozens of people to the ISS passing over.  I am a very good photographer so I will not say amature and have phtographed the ISS with the Milky Way in 360 panoramas, some on Google Earth    http://www.panoramio.com/photo/37492413;39.55035;-104.99195
