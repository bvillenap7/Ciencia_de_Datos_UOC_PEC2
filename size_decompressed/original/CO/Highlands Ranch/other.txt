Object moved silent to west at an estimated altitude of 2500 feet.;1998-09-22 23:15:00;Highlands Ranch;Object moved silent to west at an estimated altitude of 2500 feet. At 23:15 Sep. 22,'98 I had glanced up at Jupiter which was at appx 30 degrees above southern horizon.  At this point I noted an object moving rather slowly (speed est. 250mph) on a course of 250 degrees.  No sound came from the object.  It appeared a dull copper from below and was shaped like a very thin, elongated boomerang.  I thought it might be gease flying at night since several lakes are nearby--but no tell-tale calling amongst members of the flight could be heard.  I blocked low level lighting as best I could and observed the object make a slight 15 degree banking turn slightly to the WSW.  I lost sight of it against the background of a streetlight.  I hold a Masters Degree in Aeronautical Science, and have worked in the aerospace industry for several years.  I currently teach college level Astronomy.;39.55035;-104.99195
Lone Tree/Highlands Ranch UFO tracking north to south pattern;2018-09-14 20:56:00;2 hours;Lone Tree/Highlands Ranch UFO tracking north to south pattern Had the same pattern of travel North up Quebec to I-470 then south across Lone Tree to Highlands Ranch.  Would travel consistent moderate speed.  Then the double white solid lights on each end with red blinking light.  Thought it was a drone, but it traveled up to the sky too far upward and then would drop down and freeze in place and change direction.   Always consistent with speed, it stopped when I stopped in my car, I believed it was following me.  The object waited for me at one point at a friend's home, and as I came out of the house an hour after I saw the object it then passed right above me again near the south of Highlands Ranch open space field.  It flew away, and then went back up north past I-470 and then back over to where I lived in Lone Tree.;39.55035;-104.99195
