LIghted cylinder unexplained object was spotted in Douglas County Colorado;2002-04-16 21:45:00;1 to 2 min;LIghted cylinder unexplained object was spotted in Douglas County Colorado I walked out of a friends house after an evening meeting.  I noticed the object immediately.  I was larger than an aircraft would have been and was just floating in the sky.  It was cylinder shaped with running lights on it.  They seemed to be whirring around the object.  The light were white with some blue and pink in them.  I considered I was possible seeing a plane at some strange angle, but there were several aircraft in the sky over Denver and this was very different.  The lights seemed to be larger and brighter than other aircraft lights.  The object was silent and started to move 1 direction only and that was straight down.  When I first saw it it was about 40 degrees above eye level, then it just floated straight down like it was going to land somewhere.  I lost sight of it behind some hills and trees.  The sighting lasted 1 to 2 min.;39.55035;-104.99195
