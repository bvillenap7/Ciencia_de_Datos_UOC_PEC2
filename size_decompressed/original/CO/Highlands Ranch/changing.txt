My husband and I are retired educators and our adult son is an artist.  We saw a light in the sky that was bigger than a planet and hanging completely still in the eastern sky.  The left side appeared red and the ride side, white.   The light moved quickly straight up and then stopped and stayed perfectly still.  Then it moved quickly and straight to the left, then paused.  Then it moved quickly to the left, paused and then went straight down.   Using my telephoto, I viewed it closer up and it appeared like a hexagonal orange orb, with other lights glowing behind it.   The object seemed to move forward and then backward.  Then it changed into four lights that pulsated, rather than blinked.  Two of the lights were red and the other two seemed white or blue.  It eventually disappeared by moving downward, behind the trees in the distance.  Upon reaching the land, it seemed to spin and emit blue lights.;39.55035;-104.99195
