Looked at sky saw what looked like a meteor flying across sky for about 20 secs then suddenly split into 5 balls, two were on the left, two on right and one above those four in the middle. If you drew lines along the balls it would look like a house hovered for about 15 secs then suddenly disappeared only to reappear seconds later as a single ball on the horizon and stayed for about 10 seconds then disappeared again.

Fire orange orbs.;2014-01-24 21:40:00;5 minutes;Fire orange orbs. Coming home from work turned onto my block at night bam 5 to 6 fire orbs looking like fire in balloons they were fading out one by one did take couple of pictures  As they faded i could notice a balloon shape after orange fire burnt off.  My camera did catch a gassie Clouds substance around objects.  the funny thing to me was seeing these objects with pulsating fire in the midst i wonder what kind of material can float and have fire in it as a wheater balloon does it seems to me that gasses would have to controled some how other wise burned up quickly.  No these strobed Through the air.  With fire.   I estimated objects 1000 ft to 2000 above moving 5-10 mph  5 ft in diameter.;39.55035;-104.99195
