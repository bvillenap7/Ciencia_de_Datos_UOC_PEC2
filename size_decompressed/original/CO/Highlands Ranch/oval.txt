I noticed it while looking at the thunderstorm and clouds rolling in at about 1:00 pm.  It stayed motionless dispite the clouds moving  across the sky.  We didn't hear any noise, and when we looked away it was hard to visually find it again it was so high b.  We were able to get binoculars to see it better, but I lost site of it when I went to get my telescope, and neither my dad or myself could find it again.   A mild thunderstorm followed, the clouds were very cool looking, interesting.;39.55035;-104.99195
