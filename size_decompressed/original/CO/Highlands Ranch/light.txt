We saw a strange red light in the sky south of Denver.;2000-07-20 22:00:00;10 minutes;We saw a strange red light in the sky south of Denver. While on vacation in Colorado, we observed a red light in the southern sky, looking toward Colorado Springs. The object sat for several minutes, then moved toward the east, where it sat a few more minutes before disappearing. The red light was definitely sitting still in the sky for a time because its later movement was obvious.;39.55035;-104.99195
Bright light going at high speed completely reversed direction and then disappeared.;2017-07-23 22:05:00;20 seconds;Bright light going at high speed completely reversed direction and then disappeared. We had just taken our dogs out for the last time tonight, and we were sitting in chairs on the patio.  There were some clouds, but we could see planes and stars, and I was looking up at the stars, when I noticed a very bright light moving quickly across the sky from west to east. It was way above the plane traffic and it was really going fast.   I told my husband to look at it, and he said he thought it was probably a plane in the Jetstream and was so high up because it was bypassing Denver.   So he went back to watching the dogs and I kept watching the object for about another 5 seconds when suddenly it completely reversed direction and went back to the west at warp speed and disappeared.  It wasn't hidden by the clouds because I watched for it to reappear but it never did.  When it reversed direction it didn't turn or waver it just went the other way in the same line it was traveling in.;39.55035;-104.99195
Continuous string of lights moving across the early morning sky from south to north.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-23 05:30:00;30;I viewed what looked like a continuous string of lights moving across the early morning sky from south to north in Highlands Ranch, CO. On the morning of Saturday, November 23rd at 5:30 am I went out on my 2nd floor balcony wearing only my pant bottoms to smoke a cigar.  I’m telling you this to help show you the timeline of what I saw.  As I stood there and looked up at the night sky, I watched a light come from north to south.  It took about 1 minute for it to move north from about 2 o’clock south in the sky to about 12 o ’clock straight above.  Being out there only a minute with just my pants I was getting cold and ran in quick to get a shirt.  On my way in I noticed another light coming from the same direction and hurried and got a shirt on and went back out, taking less than a minute to get back out. Standing out in my shirt, I noticed 2 additional lights following the same path.  Still cold, I stepped inside to grab my coat.  This time coming out about 30 seconds later, I looked up and saw 3 lights in line with each other about 1 o’clock in the sky, coming much faster in the same direction from south to north. I continued to watch and more lights continued to move across the sky in increasing numbers, grouped together in lines, not clusters, moving from south to north. About 5:15 am, a small prop plane flew underneath the lights moving west to east.  I kept counting the lights as they continued to appear, and lost count after 75.  I estimate that I viewed a little over 200 lights total, however due to the horizon getting brighter, I believe there may have been more, just not visible any longer. One last thing I’d like to mention, is from the point of start of 5:30 am, to the point it ended at 6:00 am, looking southward, I noticed that the lights started at an 11 o’clock angle, still facing south everything ended at a 2 o’clock angle. I would like to receive an explanation of these lights if possible.  If I were to give it a basic explanation, I would say it looked like continuous strings of lights moving across the sky. Thank you for your time and attention to this.	;39.55035;-104.99195

We were nearing Quebec in Highlands Ranch when a bright, solid bluish-white light dropped out of the cloudless night sky above us, seemingly within a couple thousand feet off the ground.  It zipped southward, arced downwardly west, then just blinked out.  It was much too fast and bright for a plane or helicopter, turned too sharply, and defied all logic of nearby light and traffic patterns.  We're both educated 50+ adults and have years of plane & shooting-star spotting experience and we've never seen anything like this.;39.55035;-104.99195
