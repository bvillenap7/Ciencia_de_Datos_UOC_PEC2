Low flying Globe of light crossing the sky from south to north no sound.;2019-09-19 20:30:00;1-2 minutes;Low flying Globe of light crossing the sky from south to north no sound. On 9/19/19 at approximately 830 pm, myself and roommate were outside on the patio when I looked up to see a huge light in the sky. I pointed it out to my roommate  saying that’s too low to be a satellite and there aren’t any aviation lights showing(no blinking lights) I moved to a darker position for a better view and continued to watch the globe of light and make commentary to my roommate as to possible explanations’ and why there was no sound.  After it had passed over head I noticed a satellite passing within my observation area going the other way and a one point they were in line in the sky and the comparison to a satellite was easy, it was not a satellite, it was not a plane.  My roommate could not see the satellite and kept his eyes on the globe which as it made its way north the light faded as if the object accelerated and disappeared before it passed the horizon.  The entire observation lasted approximately 1-2 min. I am a female professional that contracts with DOC, my roommate is a male retired Colorado state trooper, we are both in our fifties.  We discussed our observation afterwards as the sky had many airplane flights passing over as we continued to watch the sky and see if the light globe returned it did not.  We agree that no other common flying object in the sky looked like what we saw and we have no explanation as to what we saw this night.;39.1032;-108.368
