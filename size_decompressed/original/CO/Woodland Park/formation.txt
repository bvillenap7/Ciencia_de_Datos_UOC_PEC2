((Spacelink satellites?));2020-03-05 19:55:00;5 minutes;I saw a strange sequence of lights being shot out of a “star” in the western sky maintaining an equal distance in a diagonal line. Walking into the house, I looked to the west night sky and saw what I thought was Orion’s Belt.  I thought I was going nuts because I know that it is usually southish of my house at that time.  Then I noticed a ball of light shoot out of one of the “stars” going up into the sky instead of down.  This happened repeatedly in equal interval, creating a diagonal line up towards the north.  So, I called my husband to verify that I wasn’t going crazy and he saw the same thing.  It reminded me of the old shooting arcade games that shot things out with equal intervals.  This lasted maybe 5 minutes before it stopped.  I honestly have no idea how many there were, but there were maybe 5 in a row before the top one disappeared from view with a total of 13 in the series that I observed.;38.9932933333333;-105.059853333333
