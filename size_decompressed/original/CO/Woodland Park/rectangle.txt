Lights and a thin retangular shape.;2001-02-17 19:10:00;2 minutes;Lights and a thin retangular shape. Looked kind of like a plane, but I knew it wasn't because planes can't hover. It stayed still for appox 1 minute and then moved away and was not visable anymore. It had quite a few lights on it with the colors of blue, green, and red. And it also did NOT make any noise whatsoever, as you can hear planes as they fly by. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.9932933333333;-105.059853333333
