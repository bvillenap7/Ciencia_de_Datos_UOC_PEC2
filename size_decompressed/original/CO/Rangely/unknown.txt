While star gazing, facing directly up from ground. Two objects, very distant (thought were satellites at first) crossing galactic plane from south-west in north-east directionality. Both objects started out very dim, increased in brightness until a visual magnitude of approximately equal to the star Sirius. Faded out approximately same speed as faded in. Saw for a total of about 30 seconds. Brightness peaked as it was directly overhead. Trailing object appeared to 'weave' back and forth slightly, but stayed a constant distant behind lead object. No visible blinking on either object. Looked up ISS and it was reported to be over Indian Ocean at the time, so could not have been that.
