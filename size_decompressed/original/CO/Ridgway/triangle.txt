Unidentified flying object near Mt.  Sneffels;2016-09-17 19:00:00;15 minutes;Unidentified flying object near Mt.  Sneffels My girlfriend and I witnessed a triangular shaped object with very bright cylindrical shaped lights at the corners.  It was stationary and remained to the east of our local mountain (Mt. Sneffels) for about 15 minutes, before moving off to the southeast, and then out of site.   Not sure what it was, but was most definitely not a star or planet.   Did anyone else from my area see the same thing?;38.1417;-107.75
