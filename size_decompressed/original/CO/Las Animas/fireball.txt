The first blew up, the second flew on by and disappeared. 2340 hrs., Monday 12/13/99. I walked out to lock my car for the night when I noticed 2, one folllowing the other, meteors, space junk... coming from the north of Las Animas going south. The first blew up, the second flew on by and disappeared. They were in the air a little longer than most falling stars. Next was a ground based explosion(large) south of Las Animas, by the sound quite a few miles to the south. I thought this was space junk on reentry, so I called Space Command and the officer told me they did not track space junk and he really did not know of any one who did it, there would be no one to call to find out. I told him of the largeness of the 1 object, bright buring blue and bright white(may have been below cloud level, cloudy in parts tonight) and possibly impact south of Las Animas. He could have cared less and told me to call my local police. The thing that really bothered me was the explosion south and the officers excuse of no way to track it and how he could care less about the explosion(not a sonic bomb).;37.923;-103.0884
