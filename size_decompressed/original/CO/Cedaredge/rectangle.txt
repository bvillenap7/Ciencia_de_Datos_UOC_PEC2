Day time observation of rectangles with aircraft.;2012-09-19 15:50:00;less than 30 seconds;Day time observation of rectangles with aircraft. Three rectangular objects in formation being apparently escorted by military aircraft flying west by north west.  One rectangle was larger than the other two and had a silver shine and apparently had several round lights or reflections on south facing side.  The plane flew a little north of formation and stayed course with rectangles.  Only sound was from one engine- obviously aircraft.  The other objects added no noise.
