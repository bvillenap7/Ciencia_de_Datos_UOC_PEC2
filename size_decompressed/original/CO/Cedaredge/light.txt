I often watch the stars, we have an beautiful large view facing south off the Grand Mesa.  I had mentioned to my husband that at any given time of day or night, there would be a minimum 3 planes in the sky view.  Traffic from Denver to Salt Lake City etc.  This was not a plane. I saw a round light through the first of three large panes of glass in my bedroom. I thought what a bright star, huge. I watched, it seemed to be moving, so I thought satelite.  No, this was skirting left, up, down & right not dramatically but noticeably. It was in the distance, how far I don't know but close enough to see the back and forth movements. I watched it cross to the second pane of glass, still bright. No flashing lights like a plane, of which there were three I could see in the same sky area. It wasn't consistant moving like a statelite would very high in the sky.  This was a bright round moving light.  As it entered the third pane of glass, I woke my Husband to ensure someone else could see this.  He did, very clearly and he saw the darting motion...then poof !  It disappeared, we both gasped and confirmed what we saw.  It didn't drop, or speed away, the light went out - poof.;38.9141;-107.9241
