We were sitting watching TV facing two large south-facing windows. Suddenly a large greenish light appeared moving rapidly, low across the sky in an east to northwest direction eventually disappearing behind Grand Mesa. It appeared to some of us as it was swirling as it moved. We wish to report this as surely others in the area saw what we did;38.9141;-107.9241
