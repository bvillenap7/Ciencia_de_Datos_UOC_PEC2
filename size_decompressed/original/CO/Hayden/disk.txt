Observered unmistakeable very bright metallic saucer/disc hovering and moving slightly;2008-06-20 12:30:00;10-15seconds;Observered unmistakeable very bright metallic saucer/disc hovering and moving slightly UFO Sighting   I was traveling east on Highway 40 coming into downtown Hayden, Colorado  to pick up a pizza at Wolf Mountain,  traveling at 20 - 30 miles per hour.  The sky was dark  blue with some sparse cirrus type clouds. Looking into the sky in front of me I had observed what appeared to be an unmistakable disc, a very bright shinny metallic silver, a silver unlike any I had seen before. I had thought to myself, maybe it is a very shinny old plane moving forward, however it was moving slightly to my right as if semi-hovering.  I could not take my eye’s off of it as it,  again ever so slowly shifted to the right .  I had also noticed a jet much farther distant and very  high with it’s vapor trails. I thought to myself this is definitely a disc and was watching to see if it would make any sharp movement’s, when a tree branch and than a number of buildings obstructed my view for about 5 to 10 seconds. I observed the craft itself for about 10 to 15 seconds. When that area of the sky came back into view there was a wide funnel/chimney cirrus type cloud extending vertical and angular to the left, in it’s place.  The disc was gone. I stopped at the pizza shop, got out the car and went out across the street to get a wider view.  If it was a plane it would still be in view somewhere, I thought.  Nothing in sight except for this broad funnel/chimney type cirrus cloud. I looked at my pocket watch and it was 12:30 pm Mountain Standard Time. The size of the disc relative to the sun was very near one quarter to one fifth of the Sun.  Relative to a star it was perhaps 20 times larger or more.
