Chevron-shaped object in the sky above Eagle County, Colorado;2011-07-01 21:30:00;5 - 10 minutes;Chevron-shaped object in the sky above Eagle County, Colorado At approximately 21:30 on 7/1/11, we saw an extremely bright white light in the sky.  It was very bright and it was traversing our view in the sky at a very rapid speed.  It paused in the sky twice, traveled again and just above the line of houses it stopped for a longer period of time, directly in front of our view, but quite a ways up in the sky and then it disappeared.   We took a video and three photos of it.  When we zoomed in on the photo we took from our iphone we could clearly see that it was a chevron shaped object with a round circle, black in color on the bottom of it.  There was no sound associated with the object.   The first to see the objects were 5 children, ranging in ages 7 to 14.  They were sitting in the street watching the object, one child came into the house to report what they were seeing and to ask us, (parents, ages 39), what it might be.   We went outside and at first thought it was a planet, then a satellite and then as it disappeared!, we were not able to determine what it was.   We didn't think much about it, (assumed it must have been a satellite, etc.) until we zoomed in on the photo and saw the object more clearly and could not identify it.;39.6618;-106.9671
