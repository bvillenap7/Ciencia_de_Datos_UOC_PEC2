UFO near Gypsum and Eagle Colorado around 1987 - strange oval object hovers and speeds away;1987-07-21 11:00:00;5 minutes;UFO near Gypsum and Eagle Colorado around 1987 - strange oval object hovers and speeds away Back in 1987 (approximately) my husband and were driving on a rural road from Gypsum, Colorado, to Eagle, Colorado.  I believe it was mid-day around 11 or noon.  Just outside Gypsum, past the high school, there was a small farm with a ranch house and barn on the left hand side of the road (we were headed East.)  While driving, we noticed a strange metallic oval/sphere that was hovering over the farmhouse.  It was about 20 – 30 feet above the house and seemed to be floating.  The metal of the object did not have any reflection and was hard to make out any detail.   The object was not large, perhaps the size of a small car (VW bug).  The main thing that was odd was the way it moved.  It made no noise, and the object’s movements didn’t make sense or seem to apply to the laws of gravity and physics.  It floated, and then hovered above the farm house.  Then, suddenly, the object shot up into the sky extremely fast.  Its speed was faster than anything had ever seen before.   Afterwards, my husband and I looked at each other with stunned faces and said, “What was that?”  And then for some reason, we discounted it and never talked about it again.   I had completely forgotten about this occurrence until a few years ago.  I have no idea why I didn’t report the incident or tell anyone else what we saw.   However, without a doubt – I believe that it was something not natural or normal – definitely a UFO.;39.6618;-106.9671
