Lights in the sky moving in all directions;2020-04-17 21:00:00;30 minutes;Lights in the sky moving in all directions First we saw lights moving in formation like a triangle and then more appeared moving west to east.  The more we watched the more we saw.  They went in all directions and at different speeds.  They seemed to be silent and high up.  We called other people in the valley and everyone could see the same lights.;38.87;-107.6025
