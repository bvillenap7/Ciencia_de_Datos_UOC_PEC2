Toward silver mountain, they were invisible except when the sun hit them, they glistened brilliant reflection. Looked at them with binoculars and they turned and moved within the air waves, they at one point made a “c” and wishing the middle of each c. A middle pistole like in a flower, was seen. It lasted about 4 minutes. Watched them stay close together if one got away from the other they would come together closer again. Watched until I could not see any further glistening of the sun on them. The inly time I could see was when the sun hit them and was bright white in color. Tried to get a video. But when the video came out no white glistening, they were black round dot areas;37.6488;-104.7757
