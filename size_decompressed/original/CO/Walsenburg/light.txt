3 small lights that made a formation, moved separately and disappeared.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-14 00:30:00;>30 seconds;3 small lights that made a formation, moved separately and disappeared. I was on a camping trip near the base of the San Juan mountains just north of Walsemburg, CO.  Around 12:30-1:00 am, there were 3 small lights, the same size of the stars off in the distance.  At first only one was moving, slowly and towards the earth but directed north.  I didn't notice the other two until it abruptly disappeared.  That's when the second light started moving at the same speed but in a slightly different direction.  Again it disappeared abruptly and that's when I noticed the third light do precisely the same as the other two-slowly move in a slightly different direction and abruptly disappear.  These did not resemble a satellite as they moved from a similar point of origin, traveled only a short distance-separately-while the others were still-then all disappeared.
