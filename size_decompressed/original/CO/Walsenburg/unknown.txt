The object was illuminated but it was assumed that was the setting sun's rays were striking the object. The object was at times stationary but at  times it's path of travel was also moving in all directions. As an example the object would move forward, backward,and in a curved path it. It's speed was variable and it's excelleration was uneven sometimes quite fast then stationery and it's path also would wobble at times. As a pilot of various aircraft I know of no such capability for the movements observed by any man made craft including drones at the altitude observed. Being that the object was at a extremely high altitude no discernable shape was observed. The objects movements were it's only distinguishing  characteristics from the other observed objects being stars, planets and satellites. The night sky was perfectly clear and No obscurations w! ere present. A number of satellites moved in the object's area but their tracks were straight and constant in contrast to the object observed. The object appeared as a star.;37.6488;-104.7757
