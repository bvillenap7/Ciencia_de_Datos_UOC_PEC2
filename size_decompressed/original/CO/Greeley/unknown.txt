Yesterday was really foggy in Colorado.  On my way back from Boulder, I saw at least 3 blocks from my house 3 red lights up in the sky but in a shape that would add up to the shape of a UFO.  I laughed at myself for thinking that but as I watched it it was going VERY fast for an airplane  I thought it was a jet but the red spaced out lights made it look much bigger than that.  It was higher up in the sky and was traveling about (my guess) 6 or 7 times faster than an airplane.  The solid red lights started to blink rapidly and then rhe object literally went so fast to the right my eyes couldn't keep up with it.  It just BOOM flew to the right and was GONE.   I tried to search for some reasonable explanation for what this thing was.  It wasn't an airplane or jet so the only other thing I could think of was some sort of m! ilitary craft like those really huge silent bombers but where I saw this UFO is not anywhere near a military base.  And I gotta tell you (with my expierience living right next to a marine base) this did not move as fast as one of- what I saw.  So, to kind of wrap it up here, I do believe now that what I saw wasn't something that should have been seen, and I'm going to have a really hard time trying to unsee it.  But to make something clear, I think that there are oher planets out there- more- beyond our imagination, so maybe this thing that I saw is just an airplane to some normal people like us. Hopefully not some green big headed creeps......;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811
