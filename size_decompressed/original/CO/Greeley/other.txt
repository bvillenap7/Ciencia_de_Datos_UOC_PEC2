Bar shaped craft;2009-09-26 23:00:00;5 minutes;Bar shaped craft The object was flying around a cow processing plant it was doing afly around it while I was driving to my home, it had 2 lights on each end it looked like it was a bar floating around the lights did not change colors as would a helicopter or a plane. It had even flown over the car and back to the plant area and it stopped and hoverd. It had made no noise and when it had gotten close the silloute of the vheical was still bar type. Only other possiblity would be a predator UAV from our local air force base but it is a small space command center so likely hood of that is zero.;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811
Strange lights (stars?) in the sky.;2015-09-12 20:20:00;~5 minutes;Strange lights (stars?) in the sky. I was in my bed trying to take a nap when I get a call from my husband at work saying that he wanted to let me know his manage had sent him outside to look up at the sky and see the odd lights.  He told me to go outside and check and so, of course, I did.  When I went outside and searched around, it wasn’t long before I found the lights he was talking about. There were three extremely bright ones (equivalent to the North Star) and above was a huge cluster of at least 100 smaller lights. It almost appeared as though they were spelling out something but I couldn’t quite make out what it was.  As I was standing out there staring at it and trying to figure out what or if it said anything, the three larger lights started blinking, slowly at first then a bit more rapidly and eventually blinking out, the smaller lights following suit.  They all looked as though they were stars with the same shape and color as one you would just randomly see in the sky but I have never seen stars behave like that.;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811
My friend came by my house last night, it was a clear night. Street lights were the only lights on at the time, ((anonymous report));2017-10-07 18:30:00;20 minutes;My friend came by my house last night, it was a clear night.  Street lights were the only lights on at the time, when I happen to look up and what looked to be like some sort of airplane or aircraft circling around above the police station.  It disappeared for about good 5 mins  then I seen it circling again  maybe 5 feet from the original position.  It looked like a foam paper airplane model you throw in sky.  It had no motor sound or sound at all, but seemed to blend in with the darkness of the sky.  The only way I was able to see it was from the reflection it gave off under the wings.  It had to be about 10 feet wing span.  It moved like a bird would.  Like ascending then coasting.  The only way I was able to see it was from now focusing on it directly.
