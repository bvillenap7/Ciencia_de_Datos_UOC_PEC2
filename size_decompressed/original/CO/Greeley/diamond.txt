Large diamond shaped craft with white-yellow diamond shaped lights sighted in Greeley, CO;2001-06-23 00:00:00;1.5 sec.;Large diamond shaped craft with white-yellow diamond shaped lights sighted in Greeley, CO A group of us were sitting on my friend's lawn at midnight (friday night/saturday morning)when I looked up to see what I at first thought was a shooting star traveling from south to north.  A friend of mine looked up at the same time, and we both saw an object that had two brightly lit white-yellow diamonds which never once blinked.  The diamonds were surrounded by a much larger diamond shaped structure that was outlined faintly in orange.  The object was in full view for 1.5-2 seconds, before a tree hid it from view.  My friend and I ran into the street (to see around the tree) but the object was gone.  It was huge (maybe 3/4 the size of a full moon in the night sky), and was moving very fast (I would estimate far above Mach 1), but it didn't make any sound at all.  The diamond shaped lights were perfectly symetrical, as was the craft.  The sighting was in between 10th and 11th avenue on Cranford Street in Greeley, Colorado.;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811
