One saucer shaped metal object over Greeley, Colorado.;2010-10-15 17:40:00;23 minutes;One saucer shaped metal object over Greeley, Colorado This is not necessarily a report, more of a follow up. I reported a sighting on 10-15-2010, I remember the date because there were reports on the TV about that day being the anniversary of UFO balloon boy from 2009. It is because of those reports that I did not report this during the incident.  However, I have seen pictures of this type of UFO on the previous UFO images. I kept trying to convince myself that this had something to do with the UFO balloon boy, but I went inside for a moment to check something, this took about 20 seconds, and when I came back outside to view it again it was nowhere to be found.  Even though, I had a full view of its location in the sky. I thought at that point this was a hoax.  What convinced me that this was a real UFO, was that at 18:20, I counted 12 fighter jets flying in a direct pattern from the direction of Buckley AFB to the location where the UFO was hovering.  I know they were fighter jets because they flew directly over the apartment complex that I live in.  We have never had any sort of air craft fly directly overhead here before this incident and we have not had any air craft fly over since then.  The air craft flew directly to the location where the UFO was located.  The last 10 fighters continued on past the area and the first 2 approached the location and flew in circles at the exact location for a few minutes before continuing on with the original flight path. My report was not considered to be credible because I was so excited that I forgot to take pictures or video tape this. I am just wondering if there was any information or verification of this event. I know I had no pictures but, I KNOW WHAT I SAW!;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811
