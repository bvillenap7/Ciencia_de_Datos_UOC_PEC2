formation of 9-10;2004-05-21 15:00:00;5 minutes;formation of 9-10 I was outside and looked up and spotted these objects.  At first i thought it was birds, they were pretty high.  Than two birds crossed my line of vision and they werent birds.  I watched them as they made turns and changing places and circling the others, when one departed and flew to the NW and another that i hadnt seen previously seen came in from the SE and joined it and they continued to the NW.  The others continued in formation and disappeared to the SE behind a tree.  They would change color from white to black like turning to the side.;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811
50-100 lights in the sky in formation over Greeley, CO.;2015-09-12 20:00:00;15 minutes;50-100 lights in the sky in formation over Greeley, CO September 12, 2015.  Myself and about 8 other people  in my neighborhood were eyewitness to 50-100 pretty dim lights in the sky moving from the Southwest, going directly over our heads, moving Northwest, before coming to a complete stop, then moving North out of our sight.  These lights were not planes, they were not balloons, they were not satellites.  They made triangle formations, switched directions, flashed at different times, and ALL came to a complete stop before heading North.  These were far higher than a typical jet, if I took a guess because they were so dim, 40-70 thousand feet or more from our ground.  Some have said this had something to do with balloons being relased from a nearby park....after reading my description above, I think its safe to say what we saw did NOT fit the description of balloons  Somebody did get a picture which catches a part of what we saw, but is not complete of the whole thing.  I am emailing that.;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811
