I was driving west on my way home when at about 0:35 a.m. on June 9th 2013, I observed a round fire ball, blue in color.  The sky was pretty dark, and the object was coming down in a slower motion then a falling star.  It looked like  natural gas blue color, and it was coming down in a slight vertical position from the north west sky.  It lasted about 3 to 5 seconds, and it was as big as a volleyball from a far distance.;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811

They crossed  our path in front of the vehicle and then moved parallel eastword along the highway, moving gradually northward until they were out of sight.  Both looked like flying balls of fire in shape and color.  They moved together, but did not always stay the same distance apart.   These were not very high in the sky, no higher than 200 yards.;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811

Over head we could see a group of little white lights blinking off and on.  To the left of the group was a larger orb that was glowing with blue light.  The group of lights started to move toward the north and the number of white light grew from approximately 20 to a couple hundred.  The group of white blinking lights appeared to follow the larger blue orb.  The encounter lasted about five minutes and the lights could be seen off in the distance.;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811
