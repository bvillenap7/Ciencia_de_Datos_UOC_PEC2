Bright unmoving amber light hovered in the southern sky for approximately five minutes.;2003-06-16 03:00:00;Approx 5 min.;Bright unmoving amber light hovered in the southern sky for approximately five minutes. I had fallen asleep on the couch with my front door open so that the screen door would allow cool air to flow in. When I awoke I got up to retire to my bed. It was about 3 am. I went to the front door to close it and saw a very bright light up and in front of me. My front door faces south. It was amber colored and I could not see any stars. It did not appear to be moving and my first thought was that it could be the hospital helicoptor however there was no noise. I watched for a few minutes and it seemed to get slightly brighter and I still could not identify it. I grabbed my digital camera and am now embarrassed to admit I did not feel comfortable stepping outdoors to get the photo. I took the photo through the screen door. I quickly enlarged the photo on the tiny camera screen and was still unable to identify what I was looking at. As I prepared to take another photo the bright light disappeared. It was as if someone had turned off a light switch. This experience has nagged at my brain since as I have not been able to think of a reasonable explanation. I will send the photo.;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811
Large, fast moving green light disappears abruptly.;2014-09-03 20:00:00;<5 seconds;Large, fast moving green light disappears abruptly. I was leaving my house at about 9:20 or so to go to Walgreens just down the street. I decided to take the long route just to enjoy the night and drive around the neighborhood a bit (opposite direction as my usual route, wouldn't have seen this occurrence had I not taken new route). As I pulled out of my driveway and turned to progress down the street, I noticed a large (perspectively about the size of a pea held in your hand) green light in the sky absolutely railing Southwards. It progressed in speed for a matter of a few moments, grew in brightness, and then abruptly disappeared as I kept my eyes peeled in the direction that I saw it in with no avail with the intentions of another sighting. I have communicated with a few acquaintances of mine, and apparently they have experienced the same thing. What absolutely astounded me was the clarity of the light, it was quite blatantly either very low to the ground or a type of lighting that I have not witnessed bef! ore in my life. Equally astounding, though, was the apparent frictionless flight that this object had attained. It was the cleanest moving, brightest object I've ever seen in my life. Others that have seen the same thing claim that the same two details, being the frictionless flight and the brightness of the light, were aspects of the sight that stuck with them and astounded them as well. It was an odd feeling night, at that. Had a very different feel to it.  This is one of many experiences that I have had witnessing UFOs, not strictly of this sort (this is the first of this sort that I've seen). Also, the first I'm reporting. I often go outside with confidence that I'll see something astonishing in a matter of minutes admiring the sky.  Thanks for reading, hopefully this gets out to anyone else who's seen the same thing.;40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811

Like someone was intensely watching me.  So, i turned on a flashlight and went to the bathroom.  After I went into the kitchen but I noticed the whole kitchen was making a weird noise.  So I peaked out the window and saw a bright light in the sky.  At first glance I thought it was a bright star but it was getting bigger.  So I jumped back and the noise got louder and went over my apartment.  I ran to the other side of the apartment and watched as it veered behind a big tree and near some housed before I lost sight, but it had blinking red and green lights on it. (All white light light with red and green lights);40.4032827027028;-104.734710810811
