I was driving from utah to colorado springs to visit my wife oct 12 2013 . Like an hour into colorado a little after 10 pm.  I'm  not exactly certain exact city I was in but it  remote colorado like 1 hour west of aspen.  Anyways I was driving and I looked at the sky and saw 3 orbs moving in the craziest formations up and  down and side to side simultaniously when I looked up like 3 seconds after one of the orbs bursted into space with a red trail behind it and like 10 seconds later the other two orbs disipated.  I pulled out my blackberry to try and get a pic but sighting only lasted like 10 seconds didn't have enough time driving and part of me was just entranced cuz I couldn't believe what I was actually seeing.  I've never seen anything move that fast and in formations that don't match any aircraft I know of.  I'm a skeptic so if anyone has a good explanation please let me know cuz I'm honestly baffeled;39.1977833333333;-106.825375
