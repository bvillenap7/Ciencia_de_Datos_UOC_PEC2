New Years Eve Anomoly In Aspen Colorado;2010-01-01 00:30:00;2 mins;New Years Eve Anomoly In Aspen, Colorado This was just after new years, us four were driving home from a party, and our car stopped working about 10 feet from the house.  Everything stopped when i turned they keys the car wouldn't make a noise.  It was very quiet and then we got out of the car and looked up. We saw two 15-20 feet long chevron shaped flying objects.  I was scared out of my mind. They were still were rimmed with blue and red and green and yellow lights.  It was a full moon and they had a distinct shape due to the bright sky of the full moon they were black but because of the lights, they kind of glowed they were moving slowly and down toward us.  Then something must have startled them but they moved north at a speed i have never seen anything go, and in a instant, the car turned back on, and the car alarm went off as well. My miles in my car are now set to zero, which is cool, but my radio doesn't work and neither does any of our cell phones.  I think there was some sort of magnetic force messing up our electronics.  Oh and my watch reset itself  too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));39.1977833333333;-106.825375
