Red. White, green flashing lights in the sky;2011-03-13 23:00:00;?;Red. White, green flashing lights in the sky I saw several stars as I was looking up into the night.  Then I noticed the different colors flashing. Green, white, red, maybe some yellow.  I realized they were way too high in the sky to be planes, so I'm reporting it.  Strange thing is. I don't live in Aspen, and I don't believe in UFOs.  What I saw is unexplainable. Therefore . I'm reporting it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
