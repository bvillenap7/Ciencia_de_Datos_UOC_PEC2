Bright white light moving fast from south to north.;2009-08-24 21:45:00;15 seconds;Bright white light moving fast from south to north. We witnessed a bright white light, much faster than a satellite or an airplane move from the south to the north.  The sky was partly cloudy and we saw the light in the clearing and then disappear into the clouds to the north.  It was moving very fast and was not a shooting star.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
Bright orange light seen moving slowly in sky then disappears!;2013-08-16 22:00:00;02:00;Bright orange light seen moving slowly in sky then disappears! Sitting on back porch at home in Parker, CO.  A bright orange light caught my attention from the SE moving NW.  Did not make a noise.  Very bright orange.  Moved across the sky W/NW.   Started to dim and eventually disappeared.   Only reporting it because my sister in Hagerstown, Maryland, just witnessed the EXACT SAME THING on 08/17/13!;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
Lights flickered in the sky, eventually surrounding one larger, brighter light.;2016-02-29 18:00:00;3 hours;Lights flickered in the sky, eventually surrounding one larger, brighter light. Saw one stationary red/white flickering light that appeared and disappeared while it was still light outside.  We noticed more and more as time passedâ€”then we saw one large one, glowing red and yellow.  The other lights (we counted at least six) moved closer to and away from the larger, which pulsed and flickered as that happened.  We all heard a buzzing, humming sound for several hours.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
UFO's over Parker CO night sky, 30 lights moving in a row;2021-05-06 22:00:00;4 minutes or more;UFO's over Parker CO night sky, 30 lights moving in a row My son and I witnessed 20-30 bright lights in a row, moving across the night sky in a row, following each other. They were steady. No blinking lights, no colored lights. I have a video that is poor quality from my Iphone but you can definitely see what we saw. They did not resemble airline or military planes, nor helicopters.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
