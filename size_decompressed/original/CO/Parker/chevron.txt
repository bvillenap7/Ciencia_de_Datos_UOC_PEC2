Boomerang-shaped object travels over suburban neightborhood toward Rocky Mountains in Denver, Colorado.;2003-10-06 20:30:00;1 Minutes;Boomerang-shaped object travels over suburban neightborhood toward Rocky Mountains in Denver, Colorado. I lived in Colorado a few months ago, not the mountains, but near Denver (it was all prarie).  While there, I became fascinated with UFOs, for a number of reasons.  The most signifacant thing that turned me into a believer was an actual sighting.  I remember it perfectly:  It was about 8:30 pm and I was watching TV in my bonus room.  When the commercial came on, I walked into my room to get a pencil for this quiz-type thing that was on the show.  I had a fairly large window in my room (it faced my neighbor's feild in their backyard), and we had quite a bit of air traffic in my neighborhood (I lived in a suburban neighborhood), so it wasn't unusual to have airplanes flying overhead.  But tonight when I looked out there, it was different.  The craft I saw was much to close to be an airplane, and it was noiseless.  I would have missed had I not looked out there.  It was like a V in shape, but more boomerang-like.  It had 6 lights that I could see.  It was set up like this:  o O 00 O o        (o, O, 0 represent lights)  The two lights on the sides (the smallest ones) were not blinking at all.  The two slightly bigger ones were blinking slowly, and the biggest ones (in the center) were blinking rapidly.  It was almost like a code, or a pattern, the way they were blinking.  Every second the middle light blinked, the smaller ones blinked with it (if you could understand that).  The lights seemed to change colors, from a tint of green to a tint of red.  The color that there seemed to be more of was a bluish-white color, like halogen.  It moved south-western directly over my house, and my neighborhood, at speeds slightly faster than I have seen any airplane move.  It could have been an airplane, except for one vital thing.  It was silent.  It was about an estimated 50 feet over house, and if it had been an airplane, my entire house would have reverberated.  Instead it moved silently, smoothly over my neighborhood, right over my roof until I could see it no more.  I dashed to the front of the house, ripping open the door, but it was no more.  The craft had disappeared.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
