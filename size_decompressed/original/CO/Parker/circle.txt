Strange lights over eastern Colorado;2007-05-01 20:38:00;1 minute;Strange lights over eastern Colorado My husband and I were watching television from our bedroom. I had just fallen asleep when I heard my husband saing to me LOOK! LOOK! I looked out the window and we both saw a huge semi circular blue green light on the horizon.  At first we thought it was some kind of explosion it only lasted for maybe 4 or 5 seconds then dissappeared.  We sat looking out the window for it to happen again and we noticed a orb of light coming up out of the trees and then it dissappeared, this happened three times.  Later on we watched the news nothing was reported.  We could see a police car and several trucks with spotlights in the area.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
At least 3 different yellowish lights seeming stationary only to rapidly change colors/Alt. at (high) rates of speed.;2012-12-30 11:00:00;Ongoing;At least 3 different yellowish lights seeming stationary only to rapidly change colors/Alt. at (high) rates of speed. Ongoing incident witnessed by 3 people numerous times.  What appears to be a star perhaps but the color of a yellow diamond.  This is how I can differentiate them immediately from bright white stars around them.  You have to keep your eyes on them for 30 seconds or so but they always move. Left to right and versa, up and down versa.  Some nights like last night Monday I told my Dad to drive up to the lake ( Pinery ) and I was immediately able to spot this one as it was rapidly changing colors faster the my eyes and brain could process.  I have hawk eyes, have always looked at the night sky since a child, but if you we're to glance at these for a second or so they would appear to be just another star a yellowish tinted star unless they are doing their light show which seems to be later in the evening. When I sit on the dock at night their always seems to be one pretty much straight ahead but elevated in the sky. Up and left from Orion's Belt. I am very familiar with Aircraft, Military and otherwise and this is nothing we have even keeping in mind they hid Stealth from us for over 30 years, SR 71 etc. This object even in its basic of aerobatic moves has got to be moving in excess of 5,000 M.P.H. In my opinion. And when it is done ( toying ) with you or whatever they are up to it takes off at no predetermined flight path at least nothing that makes any sense and they move. Conservatively I would say in the 10,000 M.P.H. or more. Last night the one thing that seemed different is that they almost seemed to have an additional much smaller circular light on the structure as well but a seventh to tenth of the object in question. I have been  observing these for months, I reside in the Pinery. This has been almost nightly with one always being about vertical over my house. Can't seem to gauge size or distance but erratic moves can be seen by my Father who doesn't have the eyesight he used to. Nothing Government and not a high powered laser ! because they would need to have an end to the beam for it to s! hine and be visible? I look for these ( guys ) every night and seem to have gotten a method to finding one in about 20 seconds or less now that I know what I am looking for. Also have footage but from I phone that I was able to set at angle and press record so I feel given the opportunity to enlarge this video it could shed some light pun intended on what the heck is going on. Also aircraft in vicinity all over and not on glide slope to D.I.A. Have also seen and heard F-16 Falcons from Buckley being scrambled with afterburner just under Mach 1 having no effect on the flight characteristics of these U.F.O.'s. Very awesome more than slightly disconcerting. Hope they are friendly because something tells me my .40 cal might best be best suited to use against myself in lieu of going for a ride! But than again if I could be assured of no anal probing what a ride that would be until your blood started boiling. I'm also sure of more than 3 and possibly smaller barely visible smaller ships. ! The 3 main ones always seem to be in pretty much the same place in sky not exact, when you line them up with a star you know it's no satellite and if you look hard enough you I can find many more in further reaches of sky. I always knew since a kid. Had that feeling or encounter? This vilifies my certainty of existence.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
2 Orange globes, smooth steady speed. 2nd  group of 5 objects,sighting more changes in formation. But seemed to hover at times;2016-07-04 21:30:00;3-4 minutes;2 Orange globes, smooth steady speed. 2nd  group of 5 objects,sighting more changes in formation. But seemed to hover at times Orange golbes flying west to east over front range at peak of fire works. 3 globes moving in a line, no sound, no other colors or blinking, we were watching fireworks from our yard, east of Parker  elevation higher than denver.  Flew over our house into the eastern sky .They were very high but kept constant speed and distance between the 3.  Did NOT go to the airport.  Within 10 mins we saw 5 more over the front range, must have  been north west Denver.  Again, orange globes but formations changed , some would seem to go low and out of sight till all were gone.  Distance too far on these 5 to tell how fast they were moving but often ( through binocculars ) seem to hold position. I saw similar objects some yrs ago. 2 flying lower, no sound  came from south but moving east. Same orange globes at steady speed.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238

Round UFO seen, and then a strange being caught in a photo around the time of the sighting.;2017-09-09 19:30:00;15 seconds;Round UFO seen and then a strange being caught  in a photo around the time of the sighting I was at a friend’s birthday party in Parker CO on 9/9/17.  To be honest, I’m not exactly sure of the time, but I’m guessing it was between 7:00pm–8:00pm because the sun was starting to set. Most of the people at the party were in the backyard listening to music and getting ready to eat some BBQ, while a few others were inside watching a college football game.  When the BBQ chef loaded up the platter of meat from the grill, pretty much everyone moved inside to eat as the wind picked up a bit.  But I stayed outside with the birthday girl because I just lit up a smoke.   Anyway, I was looking up at the sky and telling my friend how much clearer the sky was in Parker as opposed to Denver because of all the light pollution we get living in the city. Just as I said that, I spotted a satellite moving from East to West.  I pointed it out to my buddy and told her something along the lines of, “see, you can see satellites on clear nights like this.”  She agreed and that was that. About 2 minutes later, I was still sky gazing and I see what I think is another satellite coming from the same direction and heading in the same direction as the first one.  I again pointed it out to her, but just as I did, I immediately realized that this light was much brighter, larger (3x’s the size as the first one) and much faster.  I said, “Whoa, that’s no satellite!  That thing is moving way too bright and way too fast to be a satellite.”  She immediately said, “Yeah, that’s completely different from we what we just saw!”  We talked about it for a couple more minutes and then we jumped to talking about her new house.  We saw no other UFOs that night. Here’s where things get REALLY weird and make no sense. On evening 10/30/17, I was watching MNF and something told me to pick up my phone and view the photo gallery (I’ve only had this phone since August and I didn’t have many pictures on it.  But I recently saved a throwback photo that my best friend texted to me on 10/23/17, and I immediately saved it to the gallery.  At the time I saved the photo I knew what exactly what was on my phone as there weren’t many pictures saved on it), and so I did.  I discovered a photo that wasn’t there when I last looked on 10/23/17, so I immediately opened it up.  It was a strange picture of a man that I’ve never seen before.  Not knowing who he was and not knowing where this picture came from, I went to the gallery data on the phone and it said that the picture was taken on 9/9/17 at 7:13pm. I didn’t remember taking any pictures at the party, and I only remember taking my phone out 2 xs’s to check the time, but I did not take any pictures, nor had I seen this man at the party.  There were around 20 people at the party and I knew almost everyone there, but the guy in the picture was not someone I remembered seeing there that night. I sent the picture to my friend who owns the house and I asked her if he was at the party that night. She said that she had no idea who he was and then asked me, “And what is that light??”  There’s a weird light in the center of the picture that looks like a small orb flying through the air.  The weird guy is at the bottom of the photo and you can only see his face, which is scary looking!  My buddy and I thought maybe he was in front of a window, but we were merely guessing because the photo doesn’t offer much detail to explain where it was actually taken.  I have shared it with a few co-workers, but two of the people I showed it to said that it looked like it had been taken outside and not inside.  Those two people are a sheriff’s deputy and a probation officer.  Interestingly enough, I think they’re right.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
