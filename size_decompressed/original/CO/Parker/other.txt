UFO sighting  12/30/17 over southern suburbs of Denver.;2017-12-30 17:45:00;1 min or less;UFO sighting  12/30/17 over southern suburbs of Denver. I was driving on Crown Crest Blvd nearing Parker Rd, facing west.  I noticed a very large object in the sky to the slight northwest, about 1 oâ€™clock.  The object was moving at a steady and rapid rate in that direction.  It appeared to be a relatively flat craft, with 2 sets of lights on the rear.  These were flashing white lights, one on each side of the craft were blinking brighter than the other.  I looked for green or red lights, similar to an airplane, but there were none in my view.  The object was relatively large, much larger than a large plane.  The shape of the object was difficult to tell.  The color of the object was dark, so it was very difficult to see an outline.  It traveled to the northwest towards the Rocky Mountains.  I was traveling west on E470 shortly after my initial sighting.  There was no noise that I could hear from this object.  In 45 to 60 seconds, it had traveled outside my view.  It appeared to disappear when it was very close to! the mountains.  It was flying relatively low, which is what caught my eye when I first saw it. The sky was already dark at the time.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
Giant bright blue beam shot across the sky.;2020-09-24 21:15:00;3 minutes;Giant bright blue beam shot across the sky. I went out to walk my dog and looked up and there was a giant beam of deep blue light going from north to south.  The beam lasted for about 3 minutes and then stopped...it looked almost like a giant laser and someone put a piece of paper in front of it.  Towards the end of the beam, the light was a brighter, almost white blue.  The beam was big enough to make the sky divided into two and the beam had a clear shimmering around the edge.  My dog immediately took off when I saw it and ran back up to my apartment.  I've never seen or imagined of seeing something like this.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
