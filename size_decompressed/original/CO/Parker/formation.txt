One object was slightly lower and ahead of the other. With respect to appearent speed and path, these might have been airplanes - heading toward DIA. However, we quickly saw that both had very distinct tails of glowing light. We continued to observe the objects keep the same slow horizontal path for about 40 seconds. Then the objects appeared to break up into an number of smaller objects - followed by their disappearing from view. The observations were definately inconsistant with a comet-type object. It is possible that these could have been military craft using afterburners - but that would not explain the break up into smaller fragments. We are puzzled. Have others reported seeing the same thing? I would love to hear from you on this. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.

5 almost clear or translucent jets that didn't make noise being chased by one F-16 or military type solid jet.;2014-10-14 02:35:00;30 seconds;5 almost clear or translucent jets that didn't make noise being chased by one F-16 or military type solid jet,  which was not translucent or clear and made loud noise like a military jet should. We have fighter jets fly over our neighborhood all the time and just two of them shake our house, but the first five this time hardly made any noise at all and I would have expected 5 jets to make a lot of noise. Within seconds they were all gone, as they were going so fast.  The 5 clear and translucent aircraft were in a formation like a flock of geese with one in the middle and the front two seems to make turns really fast compared to an F-16, which I have seen turn and it takes them a while to bank. Just saw two F-16 or 18s at the Centennial airport a few weeks ago, when they landed and flew over the Family fun center golf course. So, I do know what jets look like.   Either the military has a new kind of jet or a bunch of UFOs...  Seriously strange.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238

3 objects together and then separate during storm over Parker/Aurora, Colorado;2017-06-07 16:45:00;5-10 minutes;3 objects together and then separate during storm over Parker/Aurora, Colorado Occurred : 6/7/2017 4:45pm   Reported: 6/8/2017  Posted:  Location: Parker/Aurora, CO  Shape: 3 darker objects each with lights  Duration: 5-10 minutes  Moving 3 darker objects spotted between approx. Parker/Aurora (perhaps Smokey Hill area) area over E-470 from person in Parker/Franktown – video and video screen captures available.   Every so often, objects would rotate and project beam of light.  Perhaps 10-15 miles away from viewer.  Objects spotted and perhaps 10 mins total observation.   Speculation the objects were there before viewer spotted them initially.  Objects initially appear to be somehow connected as they undulated together in the sky as if they were connected, but later one of the objects broke pattern with the other two and did its own maneuver and then returned to the other two, and then the three of them continued maneuvers together.    Due to the undulating pattern, it is not thought they were just one object such as a dark plane with three lights (since one did separate from the two and then later rejoin) since the viewer has witnessed planes heading to or from DEN as the viewer knows the flight path over e! ast of Parker Road and basically down E-470 to DEN.  Objects went higher in elevation, lower in elevation, east, west, north, and south – moving further away and then closer in several different patterns, some looping, some more block-style in nature.  Ball lightening ruled out since ball lightening doesn’t last this long.  Total movement from time noticed until they disappear into the passing storm that was hitting Aurora area at this time was maybe 10-30 miles.   This seems too far for a controlled drone or drones and drones don’t seem to be able to fly in unison like objects.  Drones also don’t seem to have such bright lights as object were maybe 10-15 miles away.  Objects did not appear to be metallic, but some kind of darker material, so doesn’t resemble photos seen of weather balloons, and weather balloons don’t seem to have lights or ones that were so bright as the objects did.   Objects were making various loops, appearing to stop in mid-air, rapidly going from left/right (West/East) but were generally following either an Easterly or North-Easterly direction.  During this same time, a large storm with hail, rain and lightning was passing from West to East north of the viewers position with the objects between the viewer and the storm.  If this was under human control, why were these maneuvers being carried out extremely close to a monster of a storm?  The viewer cannot think of any plane, drone, etc that can make such maneuvers.   iPhone 6 video was captured (2 min 45 sec) in zoomed in mode.  No rain at time.  Video shows birds flying around and trees for perspective.  Video is a bit shaky.  There was no water on the camera since it was not raining yet when the video was taken.  Viewers voice can be heard on video wondering what they are.  Objects were seen by viewers eyes and captured on video.  Still images are taken from the captured video since the video is somewhat shaky.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
