I was on a jobe site I drive a concrete truck I was pouring concrete into wheel barrels for another company and they were taking the concrete down a bike path and putting it in an area that neede redone..while pouring two planes caught my eye I looked.up seen the small planes and noticed.what at first I thought was an shinny foil like balloon floating seemingly between the planes..  I watched  it while standing outside the back of the truck then it suddenly stoped moving I was facing east.so.it stopped in the east and began to emit strange white sparks I carrie alot of stuff in my truck so I grabbed a pair of small binoculars and took a closer  look it was a perfect sphere chrome, it was my best guess about 6 feet diameter.  it was emitting a spiral of wat looked like white smoke look like a  chemtrail but spiraling behind it also sparks were coming from behind it aswell..I watched  it do this for a couple.o minutes then it became more iridescent or pearl like ! I guess and then it unfolded like watching a popcorn kernel pop into a pop corn in slow motion and then it became a sheet transparent and flew directly over my truck at low alattitude it flew in a waving pattern and was gone in seconds....I haven't been the Same since .;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
