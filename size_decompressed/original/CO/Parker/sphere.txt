Object moved in a large circle, then moved east and then turned and moved south until we could no longer see it against the white sky.  Object was round and small and silver in color.  It moved slowly and without sound.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
Flying Ball of Fire in Parker Colorado;2008-06-09 23:30:00;10 minutes;Flying Ball of Fire in Parker Colorado I met my friend outside of my house, and he pointed out a ball of fire flying above our heads. I ran and woke up my father, and he came outside roughly 3 minutes later, and witnessed it flying into the distance. The backdrop was the night sky, and houses. It didnt appear to be very large, and it was silent.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
Driving down the road (heading north at 39.564284 - -104.803112), I saw a white and dark teal colored light flying above me.;2014-02-23 18:05:00;1 second;Driving down the road (heading north at 39.564284--04.803112), I saw a white and dark teal colored light flying above me flying in the same direction that I was traveling.  To estimate the size, my thumb at arms length would've covered half of it.  It was very low in the air, at about 200 feet above me and I'd guess it was about that far ahead of me.  It was flying Extremely fast! I've never seen anything fly that fast through the air.  It flew straight ahead of me, then veered up toward the left (northwest), and suddenly disappeared as if it were erased from the sky.  Just gone, just like that.  There was no sound, nor any debris or smoke in the air.  The sphere shape was more like a hamburger, tilted at 45 degrees, with a white light on the upper left side, a black line through the center, and a dark teal colored light on the bottom right side.  The lights were solid and were not blinking.  When it disappeared, I got a feeling that I wasn't supposed to see what I saw.  I searched the whole sky for any more sign of it, but there was nothing.  This is the first time I've seen a UFO.  We do live close to an airport, so initially I thought it was a plane but it was flying so much faster than any jet that I've ever seen and it disappeared completely.  The closest thing that I can compare it to would be a shooting star, because of the extremely fast speed and the way it disappeared, except that it was very low in the sky, traveling horizontally, veering up and away before it disappeared.  I don't know of anything that can do what it did.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
