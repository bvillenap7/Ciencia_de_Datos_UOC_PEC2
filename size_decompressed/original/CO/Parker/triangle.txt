Triangular Craft;2004-06-13 12:45:00;1 minute;I was driving home from A Perfect Circle concert, at Red Rocks, when my friend and I noticed a strange bright orange light fixed in the sky at the corner of Jordan and Main street.  I imediately stopped the car to watch the glowing light. I was in the middle of the road and there were no other cars around.  Eventually the light got bigger and we could tell it was coming towards us.  A Triangular craft with red and blue lights slowly passed over head.  It looked really strange.  I suppose it could've been some kind of jet... but it was going slow and sounded sort of different also.  My friend and I were quite sober and neither of us have ever seen anything like this before.;39.4946257142856;-104.814218095238
