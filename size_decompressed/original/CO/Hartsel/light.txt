There was a very bright light, and I saw flashes of red and I think green.  Suddenly, whatever it was zipped across the sky from left to right.  About 10 minutes later, I looked again, and the light was back where I had seen it originally, but was moving very slowly straight up.;38.9673;-105.8788
WE WERE NIGHT FISHING ON ELEVENMILE RESERVOIR WHEN WE NOTICED A FEW STRANGE LIGHTS ON THE WATER. MY BROTHER AND I HAVE FISHED SINCE WE;2009-05-08 22:30:00;1 hour;WE WERE NIGHT FISHING ON ELEVENMILE RESERVOIR WHEN WE NOTICED A FEW STRANGE LIGHTS ON THE WATER. MY BROTHER AND I HAVE FISHED SINCE WE WERE LITTLE KIDS, IM 27, HES 32, AND WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING CLOSE TO THIS. KEEP IN MIND, NO BOATS ARE ALLOWED ON THE WATER A HALF HOUR AFTER SUNSET.THE LIGHTS WERE LITERALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE. WE WATCHED A WHITE LIGHT GO FROM DIM TO BRIGHT A FEW TIMES, BUT DIDNT APPEAR TO MOVE. WHILE WATCHING THAT LIGHT, MAYBE A 100 OR SO YARDS TO THE SOUTH, A PULSATING ELECTRIC BLUE LIGHT APPEARED, AND ACTUALLY SUBMERSED ITSELF UNDER THE WATER WHILE CONTINUING TO FLASH. WE COULD SEE THE LIGHT BLINKING JUST UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. AT THAT POINT WE HEAD TO THE CAR. WE WATCHED THIS HAPPEN FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR. WE DECIDED TO DRIVE TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE LAKE, WHERE WE COULD STILL SEE THE LIGHTS FLASHING, ONLY THIS TIME THERE WAS A THIRD LIGHT RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE OTHERS THAT FLASHED FROM BLUE TO WHITE TO GREEN. WE WATCHED THESE LIGHTS FOR ANOTHER HALF HOUR, BEFORE WE DECIDED TO LEAVE.;38.9673;-105.8788
Dancing red lights above elkhorn basin.;2021-05-01 21:00:00;2 hours;Dancing red lights above elkhorn basin. While camping in the elkhorn basin, my father and I saw a red light in the sky approximately 20-30 miles away from our location. We had an expansive view and could see many miles in all directions. Our sightings occurred in 3 separate events, as the light would drop below the horizon and reappear again later in a different part of the sky. The light had a gentle pulsing appearance, where the brightness would fluctuate by about +-20%.  The first sighting way at approximately 9pm. The light was moving back and forth across the sky in a zigzag pattern, while also moving up and down perfectly vertical. It would also have erratic bursts of speed where I estimate it would cover many miles in less than 1 second. The light dropped below the horizon and we went inside. The sighting lasted for approx 5-10 minutes.  About 30 minutes later we witnessed a similar light, possibly the same one, in a different part of the sky. It was behaving in the same manner as the first one we saw. This sighting lasted for approx 15 minutes.  30 minutes after the previous sighting another strange light was spotted. This time approx 90 degrees, to the west, away from the initial sighting. This light was much brighter and was white. It was behaving in the same erratic manner as the other lights before. After watching it for several minutes it headed north east and it the erratic behavior ceesed. While the bright white light was moving we also noticed a smaller, seemingly much more distant, light lower in the horizon. That light was red and behaving like the initial light, doing loops and moving in a somewhat random pattern.;38.9673;-105.8788
