FLASHING STROBES OVER PIKES PEAK-VERY ERRATIC-NO DIRECTIONAL PATTERN- HOVERING ,THEN VERY FAST- ONE HALF HOUR DURATION;2000-09-13 19:30:00;30 MIN;FLASHING STROBES OVER PIKES PEAK-VERY ERRATIC-NO DIRECTIONAL PATTERN- HOVERING ,THEN VERY FAST- ONE HALF HOUR DURATION WE LIVE IN THE ROCKIES, ON 60 ACRES ON THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN,15-20 MILES DIRECTLY WEST OF THE SUMMIT OF PIKES PEAK. WE OFTEN ENTERTAIN OURSELVES LOOKING FOR ANOMYLOUS LIGHTS AROUND THE TOP OF THE PEAK-WHICH WE HAVE SEEN ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THE PAST.  FROM OUR DECK WE CAN WATCH (WITH BINOCULARS) THE PIKES PEAK HILL CLIMB,THE FIREWORKS SET ON JAN 1 AND JULY 4, TOURISTS AND RANGERS DRIVING UP AND DOWN THE PEAK HIGHWAY. WE WENT OUT TO WATCH THE RISING OF THE FULL MOON OVER THE PEAK (WHICH IS QUITE AWESOME)- AS WE WERE WAITING FOR THE MOONRISE, WE NOTICED WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE TWO ERRATIC FLASHING WHITE LIGHTS (IDENTICAL TO AIRLINE STROBE LIGHTS FLASHING ABOUT ONCE PER SECOND) HOWEVER, THESE WERE MUCH DIFFERENT- THEY FLASHED IN ONE LOCATION (ALL WITHIN THE AREA OF A FINGERNAIL HELD AT ARMS LENGTH) THEN WOULD JUMP TO ANOTHER LOCATION AND THEN TO ANOTHER FOR THE NEXT FLASH AND SO ON--WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE A FORMATION OF MILITARY PLANES BUT RULED THAT OUT WHEN THERE WAS NO DIRECTIONAL HEADING AND INDEED EXCEEDINGLY ERRATIC-FOR THE LIGHT GROUPING.  WE LIVE DIRECTLY UNDER A TRANSCONTINENTAL FLIGHT PATH, SO WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE AIRCRAFT LIGHTS ABOUT 20-30 THOUSAND FEET ABOVE US. (WE ARE AT 9250 FEET.) THE LIGHT PATTERNS DRIFTED OFF TO THE SOUTH OF THE PEAK (TOWARD PUEBLO) AND THEN SHOT BACK TO THE NORTH OF THE PEAK TOWARD THE AIR FORCE ACADAMY. AT THIS POINT WE CONTACTED SOME FRIENDS WHO LIVE IN EAST COLORADO SPRINGS-POSSIBLY 40 MILES AS THE CROW FLIES- AND ASKED THEM TO LOOK AT THE PEAK- BECAUSE THE HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW- AND THEY CONFIRMED WHAT WE SAW.  OUR FRIENDS USED TO BE THE HEAD OF THE UFO INSTITUTE IN COLORADO SPRINGS AND EXPERT WITNESSES (MY WORDS) WHEN IT COMES TO SIGHTINGS. THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN GUESTS ON JEFF RENSE'S RADIO SHOW SEVERAL TIMES, THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL, ETC.  THE DURATION OF THE SIGHTING WAS ABOUT 30 MINUTES-IT ENDED WHEN WE LOST SIGHT OF THEM AS THEY CONTINUED NORTH TOWARD THE ACADAMY.  WE ALSO CONSIDERED THAT THEY MIGHT BE A FLIGHT OF HELIC! OPTERS B ECAUSE THEY WOULD HOVER IN A SMALL AREA(FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT) AND THEN DRIFT EITHER NORTH OR SOUTH-AND AT ANOTHER TIME COVERING APPROX 20 MILES ALONG THE HORIZON IN A FEW (10) SECONDS-WE SORT OF RULED THAT OUT BECAUSE OF THE ALTITUDE WHICH THEY MUST HAVE BEEN FLYING (THEY WERE ABOUT A FULL FIST, AT ARMS LENGTH ABOVE THE PEAK, WHICH IS 14,110 FEET- THEY MAY HAVE BEEN EITHER ON THIS SIDE OF THE PEAK OR ON THE OTHER SIDE, WE DON'T KNOW.  THE ONLY OTHER VANTAGE POINT WAS IN COLORADO SPRINGS- AND THE CHANDLERS SAW THE LIGHTS ABOVE THE PEAK, TOO. AS WE WERE WATCHING THESE LIGHTS THE NORMAL AIRCRAFT ACTIVITY WAS CONTINUING IN THE FLYWAY, WITH ABOUT A HALF DOZEN PLANES GOING EAST& WEST.

WE HAVE ONLY A CELL PHONE, AS LAND LINES ARE NOT AVAILABLE HERE.;38.8607;-105.3113
Bright white lights seen in the SW sky from Florissant.;2011-05-22 22:00:00;5 Min.;Bright white lights seen in the SW sky from Florissant. While outside on rear deck of my house my wife and I saw a very bright white light toward the SE.  The light was a flash with a much brighter center.   At first we thought it was an explosion but there was no sound.   The flash was high in the sky and was repeated several more times over a 5 minute period.  Nothing was reported on the news.  Very strange.;38.8607;-105.3113
