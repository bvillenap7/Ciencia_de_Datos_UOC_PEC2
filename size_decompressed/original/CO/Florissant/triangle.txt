As I was driving home I noticed a triangular shaped object with the corners connected with round ball shapes.  No lights.  It was a dull gray color and it was emitting a gray 'exhaust' trail behind it.  It was dense near the object and did not trail for long, as does an airline exhaust and did not 'shine' white as an airline exhaust does.  I wanted to get a picture, but I only had my cell phone and I knew it would not be clear enough to justify pulling over to try, so I instead used the phone to call my boyfriend to look and verify what I was seeing. He was just a mile from where I was.  I did not get the call through to him, so he didn't get to witness it.  It than moved directly away from me rather than across the sky and that is where my occurrence ended. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.8607;-105.3113
