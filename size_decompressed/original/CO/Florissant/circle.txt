During the HAYMEN FIRE, while evacuating from our residence, I was looking out of our windows to the south, south/west, while helicopters were flying in and out fighting the fire, and I saw an extremely bright, round object with a flat trajectory (horizontal flight) moving from east to west at extreme speed. Not at all accociated with the helicopters. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));38.8607;-105.3113
