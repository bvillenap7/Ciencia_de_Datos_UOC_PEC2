At first I thought that it may have been a plane landing at a nearby airport, but I watched for about 15-20 minutes and it never moved.  I drove down 3 different roads so that I could see it from different angles.  It looked the same from all 3 locations.  It was a round ball of light, and it didn't move. I continued to drive home I was hoping that it would still be there when I got home so that I could show my husband, but after about 15-20minutes, I saw the ball of light disappear, some red streaks of light shoot out from the top and bottom of it , and then it shot straight up into the sky until I could no longer see it. It took about 3-4 seconds for it to disappear out of sight straight up.;39.3836;-104.592
