Enormous disc moving westward near Elizabeth, CO;2019-12-07 19:15:00;15 minutes;Enormous disc moving westward near Elizabeth, CO Viewed 3 objects low in the southern sky moving slowly from east to northwest (the objects were perhaps 3 miles east of Elizabeth and approximately 5 to 25 miles from my vantage point).  I initially thought they were merely aircraft since all objects were intermittently flashing white and red light (the dominant color throughout was red). However, the objects were silent, flew in a straight line equidistant apart, and maintained that formation throughout my observation to the south.  As they proceeded into the western sky, the lights no longer flashed and instead glowed red.  As the objects moved into the northwestern sky, I noted a curvature in the lights which more closely resembled an enormous disc. I went indoors to retrieve my wife, who also observed the object until it moved out of sight.  We are both retired and scan/enjoy the sky daily from our patio observing all manner of aircraft. This was markedly different. My wife was a financial analyst and I am a retired 4th grade teacher.;39.3836;-104.592
