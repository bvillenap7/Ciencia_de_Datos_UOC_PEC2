We took advantage of a great opportunity and were able to use our aunt’s beautiful cabin in Drake Colorado, its way up on the mountains between Loveland and Estes Park.  On Sunday morning, as the Orion Constellation was just getting into full swing in the southeast sky at or around 2:00-2:30 am, we noticed something. I had my iPhone with the pocket Universe app, so I can hold up the phone in the sky at night and go over the constellations with my kids.  If you don’t know all the constellations, this is a real handy app and if you do, well then, you are a real geek.  Anyway, as was panning around with my phone, I stopped and notice something in the northwest sky that caught my eye. It appeared to be two bright stars and I then asked my buddy what constellation they were a part of as I didn’t remember seeing them earlier.  That’s when he said, they aren’t stars…they are moving! I shut off the phone and we just stared in amazement as these 2 white lights moved sl! owing through the northern sky.   As they continued to move in a pattern (as if they were surveying  the area) one seemed to slow down and the other got to a place and stopped. The light went dimmer and dimmer (bubbling like) then just vanished. A short time later, the other did the same. There was also no sound during the whole event. I’ve been looking up the sky all my life and this is a first time I feel confident, we were seeing something that wasn’t from Earth.;40.4275;-105.3831
