(We were facing North) Each light was about the size of Mars in the night sky.  There was no sound, no colors, no strobes.  The lights moved together as if each was a wing tip on the ends of a single object.  The object (lights) moved behind a hill and out of our view.  If I held my thumb up at arms length, the lights were right on each side of it.;37.2691;-104.5038
