Though out the night we witnessed  up to 50 of these discs dancing throughout the sky from a dull color and would light bright white when making sudden stops and cuts. At one point about 30-40 of these disc formed together, almost like a swarm of bees slowly moving from west to south eventually shooting dead south in a flash. I took 2 videos on my phone thinking it would not be powerful enough to capture the dull, silent fast disc...rechecking, I did capture them! Never seen anything like it.;37.2691;-104.5038
