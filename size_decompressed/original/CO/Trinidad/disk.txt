On June 8th, 2007 at about 1:45pm & 2:00 pm, I was looking out my kitchen facing Northwest towards a local peak known as Simpson's Rest.  I noticed something revolving behind a tree like a child's top you spin on the floor.  I watched it for a few minutes, as I watched it I noticed it was moving back & forth West to East.  It came out from behind the tree that was obstructing my view, I was amazed to see the shape of this object.  It was a bright silver and it was revolving mostly in the middle of the craft.  It was shaped sorta like an egg, but more or less flattened from the top. It hovered in the same spot for about 8 to 10 minutes. It was moving back & forth for about maybe 3-5 minutes. I grabbed my camcorder & filmed it while the view of it was still in my sight. It seemed to be staying ( hovering ) in one spot.  It was just sitting there hovering a brilliant shine off it.  I think the sun's rays was making it more shiny & gave it more detail.  I went to grab another tape for the camcord, when I went back to film it.  It was gone.  After this incident a few more incidents has happened.In the same area that I had observed my first sighting.  I was driving on Nevada Avenue 10-days after my sighting.  I noticed a craft moving from West to East over the mountain & then move back from East to West at a very calm speed.  It keeped going in the direction towards Alamosa Colorado (Northwest).   In 2007 when Colorado was hit by a massive snow storm for Christmas 2007 & the New Year of 2008.  Several witnesses including myself observed a craft hovering Northwest of Trinidad, over a-little town known as Hoehne 10-miles out of Trinidad.  The craft seemed to be studying our weather that fell on our town.  It hovered in the same spot for about 3-5 minutes.  It moved East to West, then it was gone.  The area I had seen the first sighting is closed off to the public.  No one is allowed up there, only certain vehicles & people are permitted up there.  I was curious to go up & see if I could find anything from the first sighting.  But they didn't allow me up there.  I will be submitting my video on youtube later this summer of 2009.
