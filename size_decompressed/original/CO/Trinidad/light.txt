I observed a white light at what appeared to be a very high altitude, moving from West to East at an extremely high rate.;2007-03-07 18:58:00;2 min;I was on patrol in the county between Hoehne and Trinidad. I took a break on CR 83.1 and looked up at the stars.  I observed a white light at what appeared to be a very high altitude, moving from West to East at an extremely high rate. I could observe 4 aircraft moving within my field of view. Using the other aircraft as a reference, this object was approximately 90,000 to 100,000 foot altitude and traveling several thousand miles per hour. The object passed over head and then headed South by Southeast. I thought that it could be the space shuttle, but the shuttle is still on the ground.  It did not behave like a metorite the light remained steady the entire time. ((NUFORC Note:  Meteors are not visible for two minutes.  PD));37.2691;-104.5038
Around 20 small dots of light, in a perfect line and evenly spaced, moving over Trinidad CO ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-14 19:00:00;15 minutes;Around 20 small dots of light, in a perfect line and evenly spaced, moving over Trinidad CO on January 14, 2020 at 7:00 pm At exit 6 on I 25 (south of Trinidad, CO) I observed 20 dots of light moving across the crystal clear night sky. They were the size of an average star, and slightly brighter. They did not appear to be blinking and there were no red or green lights usually associated with plane. There was no sound.  These dots were in a absolute straight line, and nearly perfectly spaced apart.  One by one, as soon as they hit a certain spot in the sky, they would vanish (presumably obtaining sufficient altitude to disappear from sight?).  They seemed to have originated from the south.  My gut instinct was that they were military craft (drones?)and were being launched (possibly into orbit or very high altitude).  There was no way to determine the size, as they could have been very small, very high or both.  They just seemed the same size as a medium star. However, my impression was they appeared small because they were so high.  Other cars pulled over to observe this event as well.! I'm very curious as to what they might have been, and if other people saw them.;37.2691;-104.5038
