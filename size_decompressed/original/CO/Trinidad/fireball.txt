It formed an arc from what looked like NE to SW of Trinidad. Because of the overcast sky, I don't think it could have been a meteor/fireball even though that is what it appeared to be.  I spotted the object as I traveled north on I-25 entering the southern edge of Trinidad, CO, in full daylight.  The speed and path of the object reminded me of a military missile.;37.2691;-104.5038
