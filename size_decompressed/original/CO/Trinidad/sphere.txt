Object over Trinidad;2005-05-16 09:55:00;less than 1 min;Object over Trinidad i was traveling on the train heading southbound towards new mexico. I was looking at the sky, it was a clear day and we had just picked up a bunch of kids.  I noticed a reflection from an object in the sky. The object at first looked perfectly round and metallic but the more I stared it seemed to become transparent. I thought it was a weather balloon but I could not see any devices hanging from the bottom.  I watched the object and soon there were trees that slightly blocked my view of the object but I kept my eyes fixed on it until the trees passed. The trees were only there for 10 seconds tops and I could still see the reflection through the trees. But by the time the trees passed, the object was gone completely.  Planes were visible at the same time and traveled slowly in comparison to the dissappearence of the object. I was facing southeast at the time and if I am standing on the ground it would have been above me at an approximate 70-75 degree angle. A bit before this happened the train I was traveling on lost power for five minutes.;37.2691;-104.5038
