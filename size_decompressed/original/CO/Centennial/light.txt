Strange lights seen by 5 witnesses dipping lower, rising, changing color, and playing tag several nights in a row.;2014-03-09 22:00:00;3 hours;Strange lights seen by 5 witnesses dipping lower, rising, changing color, and playing tag several nights in a row On the night of March 9th, around 23:00, 4 friends and I witnessed bright lights changing color, flying erratically, flying lower and higher for hours.   We watched them for about an hour, went inside, and when we returned 30 minuets later, they were still there.   They would get closer and further, dip down then quickly rise.   They would also appear to be playing tag with eachother. The next night, we witnessed the same thing.  We've also noticed birds behaving oddly, dogs in the neighborhood freaking out for no reason, and mist at strange hours during the day.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
5 Orange lights seen on multiple occasions, west of our direction.;2014-07-01 21:45:00;20+ minutes;5 Orange lights seen on multiple occasions, west of our direction. 5 orange lights that changed in their intensity of illumination were seen flying west of the facility our officers protect.   Two weeks later, at almost the exact same time the phenomenon was seen again.  The 5 lights appear to rise from the ground, at different times, eventually all arriving thousands of feet from the ground, before making rapid direction changes.  The lights end up “disappearing” in under one hour.   We have had 3 witnesses on the first sighting and two on the following sighting.  Needless to say, it’s not something we normally put in any SOR’s but we made the exception for both occasions. All persons sighting the craft are former military, from multiple nations.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
Diagonal lights shift into pyramid shape and fade into the distance.;2015-11-01 18:10:00;3 minutes;Diagonal lights shift into pyramid shape and fade into the distance I looked to the North West and the 6 lights were in a diagonal line perfectly spaced.  Then they moved to a pyramid shape then went into a horizontal formation and went off into the distance without a recognizable shape.  Yellowish orange lights.  No flashing indicator lights.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529

Chambers Rd. nearing Compark Blvd. (at the Centennial/Parker border) when a bright, solid-white light appeared out of nowhere at a very low altitude to the left of me in the pre-dawn darkness.  It zipped south-eastward in the same trajectory as my car, veered northward and down before it just blinked out.  It was much too low & fast for the distant flights ascending/descending out of DIA and much too fast for the smaller planes allowed in the immediate Centennial airspace.  The light was more solidly encompassing, rather than just a twinkle on a plane or helicopter.  My car was the only one on the road in all directions at 5am so there were no head- or tail-lights anywhere in the vicinity to have been reflected on my car windows or against anything external.  I've never seen anything like this before until last month when my husband and I both were startled by a nearly identical occurrence.  Two sightings of my own seems both noteable and worthy of reporting.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
