If I hold my arm straight out it was the size of my thumb nail.  It looked close by.  It stopped for about 10-15 seconds then sped off west toward mountains so fast it was gone in 2-3 seconds from sight.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529

Thought it was a plane at first with a weird shape.   Moved toward us at the rate of a plane in flight but it was spinning which made me think it was a drone.  It then shot down like it was on a string but quickly darted up like a v pattern and then up again at a controlled speed and then shot off to the east.  I've never ever seen anything like it.  Could not have been any drone or plane.  Movements were too quick.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529

On Tuesday, September 27, at around 5:15 pm in the evening, I stepped out into my backyard, facing west, and as I walked into the yard, I perceived what appeared to be a small white dot moving across the sky, northeast to southwest.  It traveled in silently in a straight line, making steady progress but not in any particular hurry.  Then it stopped and just hovered.  I called to my husband to come out. It was still broad daylight at this time and the sky was clear. As the object hovered there, it appeared to be bouncing or pulsing.  It seemed to periodically flash a reflective silver appearance, like it was flipping over or something.  It was hard to tell if the shape was actually circular or spherical – or more elongated, although when I first saw it, it appeared as a circle. It was very far up, it seemed, I don’t know how to judge the distance but it appeared higher than most planes that we usually see in that area.  It was so high that pictures my husband tried to take with his really good camera don’t really show anything other than a long, more cigar-shaped flash of light, which is not how it looked to our naked eyes.  As it hovered, there were times when it seemed to disappear, then reappear.  It hung for several minutes, then moved upward and out of sight. It feels like our ability to truly perceive even the basics, such as the shape, distance and behavior, of this object was limited.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
Bright shifting lights seen over Buckley Air Force Base;2019-12-16 17:37:00;2 minutes;Bright shifting lights seen over Buckley Air Force Base I was driving in my car and looked out my window to see what looked like four very large bright stars, in a perfect square. There were located in proximity to/above Buckley Airforce Base, which was north of my location. As I watched the lights, they shifted from a square to a diamond formation. In the blink of an eye, two more similar objects appeared next to them, as they gravitated towards each other and made some what if a zig zag pattern. A seventh light/flying object appeared next to them,  out of nowhere.  They all shifted to create a horizontal line.  At this time, I turned the corner in my neighborhood and lost sight for about 14 seconds as I drove down my street.  I pulled into my driveway, jumped out of my car, and ran straight to my back yard in time to see a single bright light (a little to the east of where I originally saw the cluster of lights) shoot straight upwards into the sky, almost like a reverse shooting star.  The sky was quiet after that! , I saw nothing else. The lights disappeared as quickly as they appeared.  They moved fast, were completely soundless, no color or blinking lights.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
