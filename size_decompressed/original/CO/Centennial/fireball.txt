Circular glowing object falls and the disappears.;2005-12-05 22:00:00;3 Seconds;Circular glowing object falls and the disappears. This happened two times, seen in close proximity of each other, on two different nights, two of us witnessed it one night and the other witnessed it a night a few months before that.   When it happened my friend and I were outside a friends house having a cig, a very good sized (about 3/4 the size of a full moon) circular blueish/greenish/white fireball with a good size trail following came falling straight down as if it were on a crash course with the south east horizon.   As it got very close to the horizon it disappeared as if nothing ever happened.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
Eight pulsating, low altitude, reddish-orange spheres/orbs over Denver.;2015-12-13 17:20:00;~5 minutes;Eight pulsating, low altitude, reddish-orange spheres/orbs over Denver. While sitting on the couch I looked outside the family room window and see three pulsating spheres/orbs that were reddish orange.  The objects were loosely formed (spacing between orbs were equal to 4-5 times width of sphere) moving somewhat irregularly, low on the horizon, west to east.    When I went out onto the deck to get a better view, I looked east over the trees and roof tops and see five more spheres/orbs still moving irregularly west to east.  These eight orb devices did not move in a standard formation.  They were never traveling in a straight line.  They’d gradually descend a bit and other times ascend as they traveled west to east.  They did not change altitudes simultaneously.  The trailing, pulsating orb appeared to be moving closer to us but moving more vertical stopping about 2-3 times higher than the other orbs that were still moving away from us, but the pulsating never ended.   A small plane flew by with its position and strobe lights on.  I have worked on or around aircraft for nearly 20 years and these spheres/orbs looked and moved NOTHING like any plane, helicopter or Chinese lantern I have ever seen.   Over a period of maybe 5 minutes, all the orbs eventually traveled beyond a point where house roofs obstructed my vision.  My wife after a couple minutes of me being outside came out and witnessed the same objects… whatever they were.   I found a video posted five years ago that shows the same type of objects that my wife and I saw tonight.  Here it is:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc2ppoJIexY;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
