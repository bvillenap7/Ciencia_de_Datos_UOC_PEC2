I am located off of Picadilly St. & Netherland St., just north of Smoky Hill Road.  I was checking out the local skies for signs of potential tornado activity. I noticed a white object moving through the sky (heavy winds) as I scanned the sky looking for characteristics of tornado weather. I initially thought I was looking at a balloon or white plastic grocery bag moving across the sky easterly, due to the high winds. I then noticed the object glimmering with the reflection of the sunlight. It appeared silver & shiny (shaped like a small hamburger/ thick frisbee) as it moved across the sky at a high rate of speed. I continued to follow that object visually as it changed direction & then suddenly headed northeast towards Denver International Airport. It continued to travel at the same rate of speed throughout the encounter as it changed direction & headed north. I continued to watch it travel as it disappeared into the horizon, AMAZING!;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
