I was outside around 2:30am MST. Just a little while ago. . . I noticed it was really dark and no moon out, dry, and crystal clear sky.  I looked from the back yard due west and saw something hovering emitting a rainbow of colors. It was somewhat static but seemed to hover in a random elliptical motion/manner.  I watched it for about 10 minutes and ran inside to get my sister she came out and then her fiancée we all stood there trying to figure what it was and confirmed it was not a satellite, balloon, helicopter, drone or anything known.  I wanted witnesses and confirm I wasn't crazy or seeing things. We all we perfectly sober for the record.  We could not debunk it.  I went back inside and got my binoculars (40x) and  my sister fiancée and I took turns looking at it.  We concluded it was exactly due west, very bright and was gradually either moving away slowly and/or downward.  We figure it was 50 to 100 miles away or so and from what we could tell it was triangular with three light source that seemed to be emitting from the points we think.  We figure it had to be massive because it was seemingly had to be since it was so far away and still seemed rather big.  As it either descended or flew off slowly it went out of view because the roof tops obstructed our line-of-sight. It fit the exact description my last landlord/friend described seeing a handful of times in the same area and about the same approximate time.  One night he said it came right over the house very low then shot off.  He said he went out cause all the neighbors dogs were going crazy. He went outside and everything went quiet.  He looked up and it was right over the house and it was bright, dead silent and huge!  He said the next-door neighbor came outside too to find out what the dogs were barking at and she saw it.  He asked if she saw it to confirm he wasn't crazy, and she said “Yeah!”  I never confirmed it with her, but I know who she is and their addresses.  At the time I was skeptical.  Now I totally believe him after this event!  If this was a hoax I have no idea how anyone could have made a vehicle do what it did or make so bright.  Kinda like a disco-tech hovering in the sky.  It kinda reminded me of a police car strobe light rack but it was spinning all different random colors.  I hoped it would just zip away into space so I could rule out a hoax.  Seemed legit to me!!!  Definitely an Unidentified Flying Object!;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
Spotted at lower altitude moving south to north over I-25 we initially saw a white strobe as we watched looking east from Dry Creek Rd.;2015-10-04 19:00:00;20 seconds;Spotted at lower altitude moving south to north over I-25 we initially saw a white strobe as we watched looking east from dry creek rd.   The triangle turns west toward us and is gaining elevation.  We look up and there is no doubt what it is.  The underside, grey like the clouds, close enough that I could see the panels that make up the exteriors underside, but the white lights at the tips of the equilateral triangle were most evident.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
I saw one low flying craft with 3 dim red/orange lights.  Triangular shape with 1 light on each corner.;2016-07-24 22:50:00;1 minute;I saw one low flying craft with 3 dim reddish/oranges lights.  Triangular shape with one light on each corner.  It looked like the craft split into two.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
large black triangle;2020-11-09 05:00:00;5 seconds;Very large black triangle with faint lights, noiseless, flying fairly low to the ground, heading south. Observed while driving to work near Centennial airport. Usually when aircraft are flying that low approaching the runway you can hear them very clearly - this craft made no noise at all.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
