Red Spiral Drone Like Object with Red Lights.;2016-07-07 07:37:00;7 seconds;Red Spiral Drone Like Object with Red Lights I was driving westbound on E-470 about 1.5 miles before I-25, just before Centennial Airport, and I saw a spiral object, about 70 feet above the highway.  The spiral was red in color with red lights that appeared to be active.   As I passed under the object, I could see an airplane taking off from Centennial Airport ahead, so I assumed the object was related to the airport.  As I looked in my rear view mirror to try and see the object it was no longer there. I was traveling too fast to get a picture. The object was hovering/floating.  I thought maybe it was a drone, but I have never seen a drone in that shape.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
