After observing for several minutes, called a co-worker to help identify.   Neither of us can explain what we first thought were birds but erratic flight, altitude, and a reflection from sun discredited the thought.  Though many military jets frequent the sky, none would fly with such patterns so close.   After viewing for some time, the objects just disappeared into a cloudy sky.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
A lighted object seen hovering over a small airport in SE DENVER, CO, area.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-25 17:15:00;unknown;A lighted object seen hovering over a small airport in SE DENVER CO area. POSSIBLE UFO SIGHTING    1/25/18  I may have seen a UFO tonight.  It seemed to be hovering in the SE skies of Denver, CO, from my vantage point.  I watched it for about 1 hr 15 minutes.  From my vantage point, it appeared to be directly over the Centennial, CO, airport approx 2 miles east of my home.  Since it was hovering, I thought of two things:  a helicopter or a UFO.  It was dark, so I couldn’t determine its shape.  Time was about 7:15pm MST. This object was making only slight movements and they were erratic.  Once in a while it made larger movements and faster but certainly not ”jet” speeds.  The main point was the erratic movements and the right and left turns it was able to make and that made me suspicious.  It could back up as well. That’s it!  Nothing else to say….
