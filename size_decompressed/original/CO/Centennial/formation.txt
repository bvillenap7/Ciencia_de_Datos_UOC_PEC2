Blood moon ufo sightings centennial.;2015-09-27 21:00:00;1 hour;Blood moon ufo sightings centennial Watching blood moon southeast, noticed single and large v and w fornations aswell as single flights flown above bird heights and below commercial plane heights.  Faint matte color off white heading south slight west.  With in 10 minutes of eachother or less.  Some appearing out of no where mid sky.  Haven't seen any since reporting 10/13.  They were not flashing lights nor emitting sound.  Traveling at constant speeds faster than helicopter x2 disappearing in the distance faster than fighter jet in vantage point over Highlands ranch.   Phenomenon stopped after 20 min interval waiting for another sighting.  I called non emergency police line, got a call from an officer watching the blood moon, who did not note the sighting, also debunked government drones which he stated have to be scheduled with the counties.  Far too many sightings to be hobby drones and far too fast.  Noticed the single sightings to vibrate upon first glance. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
Formation of 25-30 light gray objects pass through the night sky.;2020-01-19 21:00:00;10 seconds;Formation of 25-30 light gray objects pass through the night sky. We were sitting in our hot tub on the evening of 1/19/2020. It was just past 9:00 PM MST (we know this because we had just finished watching TV) Our tub is on the north side of the house and we have an unobstructed view directly overhead and to the east.  The sky was completely clear with no moon or clouds.  My wife suddenly exclaimed What is that! and pointed E-N/E. She continued to point at it and said: It went behind the trees. I didn't see it, but she described it as v formation of light objects.  We continued discussing the event postulating what it might be.  Then, 15 minutes later (I checked my watch afterward to verify), I saw something directly overhead and pointed it out to her.  She remarked that it was the exact same thing she saw earlier.  We watched it fly rapidly from overhead to the E-N/E where it vanished behind the trees. What I was a formation of 25-30 light gray objects in a nearly perfect, but 'flattened', 'v' shape.  They were not illuminated but were distinct in the night sky.  Each object looked roughly square in shape and they were spaced very closely together with even distance.   The formation was completely silent as it went overhead.  The formation passed overhead and over the horizon in approximately 5 seconds.  The width in the sky was approximately the same as my hand extended at full reach.  (I would be happy to submit daylight photos of the location if it would be helpful)  I ran inside to get my camera and we spent the next 20 minutes waiting for another pass but never saw anything else.  During that period we observed several standard airplanes flying their usual routes. An airplane (at altitude) was the same size or smaller than each of the objects in the formation and traveled much slower.  We could clearly hear the airplane's engines.;39.5957352941176;-104.877558823529
