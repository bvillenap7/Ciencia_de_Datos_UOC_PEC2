They flew across the sky one by one as if chasing each other. They were going faster than anything we have ever seen. One came by and then every 20 or so seconds afterwards another one flew by. We saw lights hit the fourth object then we saw it explode. The Fifth UFO was flying close to the fourth when it exploded.
