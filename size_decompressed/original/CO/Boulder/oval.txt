Peter)) My Girl-Friend and I noticed something strange in the sky above Boulder, Oval in shape and I have a Video Tape of it.. Interested?? Last Year I started a Video of my Daughter her Friend and my Girlfriend. I enjoy reading www.sightings.com and decided to try Jon-Bro's Techinques, Which are also on the film.. This year, approx: July 15th I walked outside on the front steps to have a cigarette and noticed a strange looking object in the sky. It was positioned approx: South-southwest at about position 09:00 o'clock in the sky, just in the back-drop of the Flatirons mtns. I yelled to my Girl-friend to look at what I was seeing. She came out-side and I told her to look.. At this time the object was Due South and about at position of: 11:00 o'clock. It hovered there for approx: 10-15 mins., as if it was looking at us. During this time I ran in to get the Video-Recorder.. The Batteries where nearly dead which accounts for the lack-of-ability to Zoom.. However I managed to get approx: 10-15 mins. of Video on the object that just hovered before it dissapeared..  The Object at first appeared Square, then appeared Oval with dim lights on the sides of the Oval. I tried to get a picture of the house below the object to get an approx: size of the object.. I fumbled several times with the Video camera due to checking the power which I plugged in later. I and my Girl-Friend were witnesses..  I have the Video of this if anyone is intersted..;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
The metal oval objects were there and then they were gone without a trace!;2002-03-31 17:30:00;30 Seconds;The metal oval objects were there and then they were gone without a trace! A friend and I were driving north on hwy 93 to boulder from I-70 when I noticed an object in the sky with clouds in its background. The object had an odd reflection as if it were made of chrome, and it was not moving in any direction at all. So I pointed it out to my friend and he spotted another one just a little higher in the sky with just a blue sky background. So I say to my friend, I think those are spaceships? Then without a blink they disappeared with no trace. It was wierd because they just were there and then were gone. They both looked like horizontal ovals of chrome or some type of reflective metal, and had nothing to campare to a regular plane or jet. That was the wierdest and most unreal 30 seconds of my life.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
October 1, 2006 meteor reported across skies of Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado;2006-10-01 23:15:00;30 sec;October 1, 2006 meteor reported across skies of Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado I was watching TV. The lights were out the window shades were open. I noticed a  white movement out the window. I jumped out of bed saying What it that? What isss that? My husband stirred. It looked like 4-5 very large thin oval shapes, directly in a line, low in the sky heading east, I was looking south. The movement was just slightly south/east. There were long thing clouds in the sky, it was clear. It seemed bright- mostly from the not full moon but also from the light. There was no sound. I said, look, oh wait you missed it (the items had just disappeared behind the siloette of a tree. Wait, look to the left of the tree you will see it come out...nothing did.  I couldn't believe it. I descibed this to my husband. The next few days I could not let it go. I went to a UFO sightings website (something I had never done before)and looked for sightings. Several people descibed seeing something similar at about the same time and day. I did not report my sighting. But then, Saturday, I read the Friday Colorady Daily newspaper, where there was an article about a man who is a meteor hunter. It stated he searched for marble-size rocks in a 50-mile strip of Colorado.There was a picture of him holding a piece of the meteorite that occured on Oct. 1, 2006. One of the brightest meteors reported in recent years slow-danced across Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. Apparantly landing south of Colorado Springs. And he was holding a piece of it that looked about the size of a coconut. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
