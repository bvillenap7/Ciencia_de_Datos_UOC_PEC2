close range sighting of lit up disk at drive in theater;1976-07-03 21:00:00;5 minutes;close range sighting of lit up disk at drive in theater time and date approximate..i was at a drive in movie near boulder, longmont area. i was visiting from out of state so i,m not too familiar with this area not long after sunset my girlfriend said what's that? at the same time i noticed a lighted craft approaching from the south west. it at first appeared to be a helicopter flying low and makeing slow, gradual turns back and forth as it got closer i could see that the lighting and motions were definitely not standard for a helicopter (or any other aircraft) the object seemed to be attracted by the movie playing on the screen and approached and hovered over the cars parked at the theater. at this time it was at a distance of only 200 feet and an elevation of 200 feet. the shape was that of a classic domed saucer..the lights were predominatly red,orange and yellows of average intensity (like car headlights or street lights) and flashing at a slow rate as the object continued to hover and descend slowly the intensity of the lights dramatically increased as did the rate of flashing. a rectangular structure slowly extended from the bottom of the disk with more lights and more colors..greens,blues,purples. the intensity of the colors and lights became almost painfull to look at. the other people at the drive in reacted by honking their horns and flashing their headlights! at this point about 1 1/2 minutes from the initial sighting, the object was only about;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
3 slow moving disks over south Boulder.;1981-10-18 16:00:00;10-15 seconds;3 slow moving disks over south Boulder My husband and I had just parked at a restaurant near the intersection of 28th Street and the Diagonal in Boulder, Colorado.  We both saw three silvery-white disks in a triangular formation above south Boulder.  Each disk looked like a yo-yo on its side, with the top section a little smaller than the bottom.  They were close enough or large enough for us to see that each one had several windows or portholes.  They moved very slowly and were visible about 10-15 seconds before they faded out of view. I am presently a psychoanalyst in private practice.  Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S.   Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.  I consider myself to be a curious, careful and scientifically oriented observer.   My husband was a civil engineer.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
The object made no noise, had no markings,  and was not made in this world.;2008-05-09 22:05:00;104;The object made no noise, had no markings,  and was not made in this world. The object was first seen as an extremly bright light through the tree tops.  It did not move but was not in a location for any star and was much brighter.  We were north bound at about 20 mph.  It was slightly to left of overhead.  The object was in the same position as we drove on a straight street.  After driving 0.3 miles there is a slight left curve in the street which caused us to drive directly under it.  There were two intense lights (about 60 degrees apart) that illuminated the details of the object.  Opposite from the lights on the other side was a bright blue pulsating flame like my propane torch. We could see circular metallic bands on the bottom.  Our best description would be a two cup-type saucers, the top being upside down on the bottom one.  After traveling a total of 0.5 miles, we made a right turn to a street to take us home. At that point we lost sight of the object.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Rotating disc with blinking colored lights seen flying along ridge in north Boulder, followed by quickly moving lights on the ground.;2013-04-22 02:04:00;5 minutes;Rotating disc with blinking colored lights seen flying along ridge in north Boulder, followed by quickly moving lights on the ground. On the morning of Monday, April 22nd I woke up at 2:04 AM to use the bathroom – and this is what I saw:  I live in the mountains just 10 mins from the town of Boulder Colorado.  My house sits on the east face of a mountain which goes down into a small valley and then up again – to a ridge that I see if I look directly east from my home.  This ridge is the first mountain (of the Rocky Mountains) and directly east of it is North Boulder.  I live on what is the second protruding mountain and my home sits across this small valley just a bit higher in altitude than the first ridge. I noticed out of the window a row of colored lights blinking different colors, 5 or 6 of them in a row, and it looked like they were on something that was rotating slowly in a circle.  It traveled slowly from the South East going directly North, up above the ridge of this mountain across the valley from me.   As I looked at it I thought it was a plane at first, or maybe a helicopter.  I became concerned at how close it was flying to the trees and houses, and then suddenly it stopped and just glided back the opposite way.  Then it stopped again and continued the way it was going and by this point it was directly across from my house above the ridge. I could almost make out the shape of it, and at this point I yelled to my husband, “Quick! Come in here! There’s a UFO!” My husband jumped up and ran into the bathroom and just before he arrived the craft went up and down and back and forth one more time but just as he looked out the window it dropped behind the ridge. I told him, “Oh, I can’t believe you missed it! Wait - maybe it will come back up.”  He had stepped into our shower (closer to the window) and was looking down into the valley and he said, “I see it! There are at least 2 of them!”  I stepped in beside him and looked down into the valley and saw that he was looking at 2 little (these are hard to describe) areas of light.  They weren’t orbs or balls of light, but the ground was being lit up – as if from a big flash light or spot light, but there were no beams of light projecting from anywhere, and they were moving faster than any spot light could possibly move.  They circled around a certain area, then a bigger area, it all seemed very random, and then they were gone. My husband never saw the blinking craft - but if not for him I would have never seen the flashing lights. That’s it, we stared out the window for a while and then tried to go back to sleep.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
