Low flying, silent, muted white lights on a chevron shaped glider;2005-10-03 21:30:00;45 seconds;Low flying, silent, muted white lights on a chevron shaped glider 2 adults and 1 8 year old girl were walking on a bikepath in Boulder, CO, coming home from dinner.  I spotted a swift, silent, glider-ike object flowing through the air at a very low altitude (less than 2000 feet).  It had 5 'lights' on it, in a zig-zag shape arrangment.  The lights were not spotlights, typical airplane lights, nor were they flashing.  They had a muted glowing quality, almost like a white/yellow glow in the dark look.  The 5 lights, I assumed at first were all on the same craft, but the far two lights wavered and moved closer together and then assumed the original shape again as it glided out of our sight.  It was very low and very large, a fist across when held at arms length.  We walked on, in amazement talking to each other and a voice on the path said, Did you guys see that?--our neighbor Alec had seen it too and he had planted his self down in the middle of the bike path.  He had noticed it when he said the 5 or 6 lights were seperate and only after they had moved apart and then converged did they take on the glider like/chevron shape when we had spotted it. The reason I am reporting this is not only my interest and excitment for UFO's but also that I saw the same thing less than a year ago, I was also in Boulder. I called the Boulder Municipal Airport the following morning askng if their were gliders up in Boulder County that previous nights, the man informed me that all gliders are grounded prior to sunset.  I am very interested to see if anyone else saw what we did and what the theories are?  I have a science background and consider myself an observant, relatively sane thinker.  This object was not a typical aircraft.  Most notably the craft was silent.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Pink and blue pulsating manta ray shaped ufo over boulder;2011-09-14 23:00:00;4 seconds;pink and blue pulsating manta ray shaped ufo over boulder I was at a park in central downtown Boulder, my boyfriend and I were just watching the stars on top of the hill in the park.  This strange 'manta ray' shaped craft appeared and just flew gracefully through the sky, from the North East to the South West.  I call it a manta ray shaped craft while it honestly looked like a manta ray was just soaring through the sky.  It was so peaceful, it glowed a faint pink and blue. Imagine the changing colors of the fish of the deep, it was exactly like those colors, and exactly like the pulsating motion.  The wings of the ship slightly appeared to be moving, and it left a faint light trail (Which we actually believed was just an illusion, while it traveled so fast). It was unbelievable, we couldn't believe how much it looked like a manta ray. It just soared so gracefully through the sky for a good 4 seconds.  It appeared to be far up in the atmosphere, based on its faint color, but it also seemed so huge.  We thought we were cra! zy at first, until we realized that we saw the same thing... we are just two college kids, no drugs were in our system... and we saw something in the sky that night, which still haunts us in a very mystical way today.

Seven blue square lights seen moving in a chevron formation over Boulder, CO;2014-10-12 23:00:00;10 seconds;Seven blue square lights seen moving in a chevron formation over Boulder, CO I was along the railroad tracks near the power plant in eastern Boulder, CO.  Something caught my eye and I looked up to witness seven square pale blue lights moving in a Flying V pattern in a Southern direction.  At first I thought it may have been a gaggle of geese in formation, until I realized that the objects were evenly spaced, square in shape, and glowing a full pale blue.  I'm guessing the objects were 200 feet off the ground and moving 70 mph.  No sound could be heard. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Dark Silent Chevron.;2018-05-15 23:16:00;10 seconds;Dark Silent Chevron. A very dark, perfectly silent chevron shape with what seemed like 2 very dim lights on each end of the wings was flying at a moderate speed seemingly only a couple hundred yards off the ground.  Only saw the dark shape move across the dark sky for about 8-10 seconds before it disappeared behind houses.  Flew extremely straight, and away from where I was standing.  No blinking on the dim lights.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
