The object was a few miles away and resembled a silver plane.  It appeared to tip its wings twice and then dissapeared.  I had a full view of the sky and it could not simply have dissappeared that quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
BOOMERANG shaped.  no lights on craft.  Nighttime sighting.  DEFINITLY under intelligent control. utterly silent.;2005-09-19 20:20:00;10 seconds;BOOMERANG shaped.  no lights on craft.  Nighttime sighting.  DEFINITLY under intelligent control. utterly silent. Lying down in a local park, looking at the stars, I witnessed what seemed to be a BOOMERANG shaped craft cross the sky directly overhead. The craft had no lights, but was quite large and easy to spot if one were to know where to look for it. Also the moon was just coming up over the horizon and was nearly full which is probably how I managed to see the craft, in addition to watching the backdrop of stars blink in and out as it traversed the sky. To get an idea of the size and scale I was looking at, extend your hand out above your head, and then create a distance of 3 or 4 inches between thumb and index finger.  The craft was definitly under intelligent control and moved from North to South/Southwest.  The craft was utterly silent. No sound whatsoever that I could hear.  It appeared to be dark in color, roughly matching the color of the night sky, though just slightly lighter and greyer. I watched the craft traverse the sky overhead in a straight line for between 8-10 seconds, until I could no longer make it out against the night sky.  Various other airplanes (with required lights of course) were in the area, as usual. None appeared to me to take notice.  There are three possibilities for what it could have been.  1.  Could have been a glider flying at night (but I still think it was boomerang shaped) 2.  Black military project.  Stealth? 3.  Unknown craft guided by unknown intelligence.  I had a similar, yet very different sighting about 7 or 8 years ago in october with a friend, of another silent craft that moved directly over our heads to the point that it filled half of the visible sky.  Huge. only very tiny discreet lights. Could not identify shape due to close proximity. 6 second sighting as it crossed directly overhead from left to right(and again North to South) over the allyway we walked down.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

Steady behavior until it faded into space.  Tonight under clear skies I saw it again, 9/14/13 with two small visible green dots of light that where emiting waves of modulating light.  It was long shapped and lasted for about 4 to 6 minutes until it became one dot of green light and faded quickly into space.  I saw the same in2011, at the same location, at around the same time.  It is steady, last for a long while and sometimes it looks as if there are 3 point of light emanating streams of light to each other.  It does not travel like a shooting star or  flashes like a meteor.  It is steady and consistent.  It is my 8th sighting since 2011.  Very steady behavior.  When I ask if it could connect with me - last evening - it flashed twice - maybe a coincidence, but  felt like it was in comm! unication. I asked for help with the floods and natural disaster we experienced last night here in Boulder.  It was very steady in its behavior.  Don't know what it is, but sure it emanated peace and green steady streaks of light that did not travel, but stayed steady in the sky until became a dot and disappeared.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Two lights very spread apart, moving in unison almost like a blimp through the sky.;2020-03-25 20:55:00;10 seconds;UFO sighting in Boulder CO. Looking at stars, then some of them started to move. Two lights very spread apart, moving in unison almost like a blimp through the sky.  Quickly dimmed the lights, then disappeared, about four seconds after I started filming... &#128760&#128149 the truth is out there!

I look straight up and it looks to be like a frozen shooting star, just hovering silently a few thousand feet above my head. The craft was massive, although I couldnâ€™t see the craft, only the light being emitted from the bottom of it, which showed up as an enormously long streak of light. Literally exactly like a picture of a frozen shooting star. It was hovering about the speed of an airplane, although it looked like it stretched well over a few football fields in length. I spent about 30 seconds trying to film it with my iPhone to no avail, it was pitch black.  Then I finally had the idea to try and take a picture of it with the brightness turned up all the way.  By this time the craft was more off into the distance but I was able to snap a motion picture of it, a short 3 second video.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
