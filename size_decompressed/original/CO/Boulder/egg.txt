Slow-moving, silver craft seen over Boulder, CO;2013-05-08 13:30:00;5 minutes;Slow-moving, silver craft seen over Boulder, CO I witnessed a small craft approaching from the west at high altitude at approximately 1:30 pm on Wednesday, May 8, 2013.   At first glance I thought it was a weather balloon, due to its shiny, silvery appearance, but I noticed that it was moving in the opposite direction of the cloud layer, which it appeared to be immediately underneath.   Also, upon closer inspection, its shape negated the possibility of any balloon I can imagine. It was somewhat egg-shaped, but with two protrusions on either side (engines?).   I heard no sound from it, but it did appear to be at fairly high altitude.  It moved slowly and steadily with no changes in direction, passing directly overhead.   One interesting note is that there appeared to be some sort of energy field around it, with pinkish waves of energy emanating in a circular pattern from the craft.  I was the only witness. I am a 20 year-old male working at a software company in Boulder, no history of mental illness or hallucinations.   I have seen odd phenomena in the sky before, but this was the first instance which I have been unable to explain conventionally.   I am emailing a rough sketch of the object's shape along with this report.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
