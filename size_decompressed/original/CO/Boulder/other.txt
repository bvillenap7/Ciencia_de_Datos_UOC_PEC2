This event took place while camping above Boulder, CO. on Flagstaff Mountain.  At this position we had a very clear view of the sky & the town below. The object went from one end of the sky to the other & was witnessed by myself as well as 4 other friends. This took place approximately in  July of 1969. We were all just kids & no one would believe us. Since then I've been in the military & have traveled abroad & have witnessed another sighting in Terrell TX. The object was copper in color , it came out of the woods as I was driving down the road late @ night & I lost sight of it as it shot straight up. This happened in 1978 on or around the month of May right off highway 429. This was an unpopulated area @ the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness records 1970, but states that the incident occurred in 1969.  We have amended the date here.  PD));40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
I witnessed a shape over head coming from the north;1998-09-13 22:10:00;10 seconds;I witnessed a shape over head coming from the north,which i thought was a cloud at first,then as it got closer ,i thought it was a hanglider.It being 10 at night,i realized i was seeing something very unusual.I was playing a song,on  guitar, in my backyard,when i saw the object.I stood up from my chair,and watched it pass directly over head,moving from north to south.I believe it was boomerang shaped,although it may hve been cylindrical.It had no lights,and a pewter or lead kind of sheen.It almost seemed to blend in with the sky. It also seemed to change shape ,as i was watching it move over head.I felt a most incredable rush,as i have been a believer in ufo's,though have never actually seen one,till now !! The craft disapeared behind a cloud,as i went imediatly inside to take notes ,and sketch out what i had seen;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Dark metalic object along Colorado Frontrange;1999-08-15 13:00:00;10 minutes;Dark metalic object along Colorado Frontrange While attending school at U of C, I painted houses as a summer job, in and around the Boulder area.  We (a fellow employee and I)were painting a house about 10 min north of Boulder, wich was in an older golf course type communitee along the foothills, I would say we were about 2 miles east of the frontrange.  While painting I noticed a black object appear from over the peaks slightly Northwest of our location, it seemed to have risen from behind the hills, but given our location was far below mountain top, it may have been travelling west at a steady altitude before it was visible to us.  After clearing the mountain top, the object lowered altitude slightly, to,I would say between 300-500ft. and continued to move east.  As it continued our way, but slightly northwest of us, it would travel slowly, periodicaly jolting forward, but never changing altitude.  We watched as it traveled from the mountain range, at first from a distance it did look as though it could have been a very large balloon, and was a dark metallic color (like Black Chrome... but not as shiney) but was not round or teardrop , as it got closer it looked a bit like a pyramidic bubble, rotating randomly on no certain axis, and possibly the size of a school bus (this would be at a distance less than a quarter mile north of us, and at the same altitude stated, I know we had to look upward)  as it passed it seamed to pick up speed and headed more northeast, it must have begun moving much faster, because it was out of sight quicker than the time it took to reach our vacinity from the mountains.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
W shaped UFO sighting in Colorado.;2007-12-03 08:00:00;Driving;W shaped UFO sighting in Colorado. I was driving around 8 o'clock at night. And I looked up in the sky, and I saw somthing flying rather low. At first I thought it was a plane, because there are public runways for planes to take off and land near where I was. But I took a closer look, and I saw strange lights. there were about 7-10 lights. some were flickering dimmly. and some were remaned on. There were multied colors of the lights. they all changed. some went to red, to white, to blue. and then brown, orange. Pink, Yellow. (Very Wired.) The lights were forming the UFO's shape as a W. It was dark out, so I wasnt compleatelly sure. It was flying at a normal plane speed you would see in the sky. And then It stoped. Looked as if it went around in a 360 in one spot. and Flew off, at an amazing speed! As it fled my sight it left a trail of light for about 5 seconds and then it was gone.

strange hovering white light that eventually descended slowly;2009-02-11 20:15:00;7  minutes;strange hovering white light that eventually descended slowly I was driving West on Highway 36 into Boulder, Colorado and I noticed a bright white light hovering above the city.  It appeared to have multiple lights clustered together as a single unit (large light on top with a couple lights on bottom).  It hovered in the same spot for about 4 minutes,  and then slowly moved down towards the foothills.  I couldnâ€™t tell whether or not the light actually went behind or in front of the flatirons before it finally went out of my sight.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
A tight group of flashbulb-like lights glittering high up in a clear blue sky.;2013-01-19 14:15:00;~2 minutes;A tight group of flashbulb-like lights glittering high up in a clear blue sky We were looking at gulls riding currents very high over Walden Ponds wildlife area outside of Boulder.  They glinted white as the soared against a deep blue, cloudless sky.   Behind the birds, seemingly much higher, we noticed a peculiar group of flashing lights in a tight formation, looking much like a bunch of flashbulbs going off at the same time or like glittery fireworks.   Having forgotten binoculars, we couldn't tell if it was one very large reflective object or many smaller ones, but it appeared to remain nearly stationary for a couple of minutes.   It was fainter than the sunlit white birds but still glittery and flashbulb like against the blue.  It was small enough and faint enough in the sky that it's highly unlikely that anybody else saw it, unless, like us, their attention was attracted by the gulls.   It continued to flash constantly as it gradually became more difficult to see over a period of two or three minutes.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Loud Noise Along with UFO flashing lights aircraft.;2014-03-11 06:35:00;2 minutes;Loud Noise Along with UFO flashing lights aircraft Approximately 6:35 am Tuesday, March 11, 2014, I was in my room studying for a test while it was still dark out, with the sun just barely making the bottom of the horizon a lighter shade of blue.   Out of nowhere I heard an extremely loud humming noise coming from the sky unlike any noise I had heard before.  The noise was extremely loud and continuous and when I went outside I saw a dark aircraft with numerous blinking lights (many more than an airplane) flying over my house toward to Flatiron Mountains.   It was flying high enough that it eventually disappeared over the mountain, though it was pretty low to just go over the mountain top.  It came from the East and headed toward the West over the Flatiron Mountains.   I watched it pass over me for about a minute or so and the loud noise continued until it was no longer in sight and earshot. It was dark which made it hard to tell the shape but rather the many blinking lights on the craft were more distinguishable!   Eventually it disappeared over the mountains and the noise faded away along with the flashing lights.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Four bright symmetrical horizontal lights on a craft in sky near dusk, banked left, lights dimmed and then they vanished;2014-05-05 17:15:00;20 seconds;Four bright symmetrical horizontal lights on a craft in sky near dusk, banked left, lights dimmed and then they vanished I was jogging south when I looked up toward the southeast and toward the horizon I saw four bright lights in a symmetrical line.  Craft appeared to bank left, lights suddenly dimmed and then disappeared.  I often view the sky as an aviation enthusiast and am certain it was not a commercial craft.  The lights were very large relative to the perceived distance. It could of been a military plane of some kind but appeared to be going away from me.  Usually landing lights or other bright lights face forward.  It was there and then gone very quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
