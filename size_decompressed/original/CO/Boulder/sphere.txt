They hovered and moved too slowly.   The fighter jet was in the same area. 11:35 am. MST: I was sitting alone outside at Brewer's Market in Boulder Colorado having a cup of coffee reading the paper.  The location is between Arapahoe and Canyon on Folsom street.  The coffee shop patio has a panoramic view of the Front Range and continental divide.  The skies were clear with some clouds to the south.   I happened to look up and see a very small spherical, metallic white object to the west about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was very far away but had a uniform color, and spherical shape (i.e. not an airplane, jet or glider shape). Because it was spherical it was difficult to determine the altitude of the object but I would guess that it was about 10 – 15 miles to the west, somewhere over the continental divide in West Boulder county.  I would guess the altitude was at 20 – 50 K feet.  It was not moving which I found to be strange.   I marked the position of the object using a tree in the parking lot.   I thought that it might be a weather balloon.   I noticed that without my polarized sunglasses the object was almost unperceivable in the hazy blue sky.  11:40:   I notice two airliners (DIA is 15 miles to the East).  One was flying West about 5-10 miles North of the object at about 15-25 K feet the other airliner was flying East about 5-10 miles south of the object at about 15-25K feet.  Both airliners were traveling in regular flight paths into and out of DIA.  I live in the mountains and watch aircraft fly into and out of DIA and Jeffco Airports regularly.  I know the flight paths.  11:45:  The object started to slowly move East toward my position.   It moved too slowly to be an aircraft at any reasonable altitude.   It moved too quickly to be a weather balloon propelled by the wind.  12:00 :  The object had moved almost directly above me, from 30 degrees to 90 degrees from the horizon.  It was still at a very high altitude.  It was still a metallic white spherical object.   It was at this time that I noticed another identical object moving past the first object heading due west both at similar altitudes.   Both moving at similar speeds.  I doubt that both objects were weather balloons, moved by the wind in opposite directions. Clouds had started to form to the west.  12:05:   I watched the first object move slightly to the east of my position towards the sun. As it approached the sun it appeared to shine a red color around the object, like the light was shining thru or around the object.   I soon lost the first object in the sun and clouds.   I tried to find the second object that had moved to the West, but was unable.  12:08  To the west at a very high altitude I spotted a fighter jet moving towards the West at about 45 degrees above the horizon.   It was clearly a fighter jet, not a Lear or Gulfstream, or airliner.   It has wings swooped back at a sharp angle.  It was moving very quickly, even at the high altitude.  I would estimate the jets altitude at 20-30K feet.  Conclusions: The objects were too high to clearly discern any features other than the spherical appearance of the object based upon the way that light reflected from them.   I was surprised to see the fighter jet.   The appearance of two objects passing each other did not support my theory that the object were balloons.  They did not appear to be any type of aircraft that I would recognize.  They were not gliders that frequent the Boulder skies.  These objects were very high up.  There were barley visible to the naked eye, but definitely objects. ((COMMENT FROM READER)) The fighter Jet this person is talking about is most likely a Mig-15.  I am a private pilot and fly out of Jeffco Airport.  There is a private pilot who has restored a Korean War Mig-15 and flies it all the time.  By the flight path and swept back wings and altitude I would guess this is the fighter he saw.  The only fighters in Colorado are Air Guard and those are F-16's.  And we all know they always have a wingman, they never fly a mission solo.  Just my .02 ((END));40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

The orbs were white and blinked on and off at time Dear Sir                                                                                                                          December 03, 2012  I looked up at the moon at 18:12 PM.  The moon looked normal, however light as bright as the moon was shooting out making the moon twice the size.  It looked like it had possibly an large asteroid impact and debris was moving away from the lunar surface.  I really think it was a powerful light source.  It was about 85 degrees from the ESE.  I began taking shots, then called my friends and asked them to look.  Carry and Amy.  They were awe struck.  This is what happened.  We had some very thin Cumulus Stratus clouds.  When the clouds passed, it was even brighter and alien to me.  I focused my camera and saw to orbs moving  toward the moon from WSW.  Then they disappeared, then reappeared .  They were moving in harmony, then quickly separated as on craft moved faster than the other.  The other caught up and they joined as one.  I will forward your picks as soon as I can.  Sorry for upsetting you. Regards  ((name and telephone number deleted));40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
4 very large bright spherical objects -- one green, the others red or orange -- moving at high speeds upward in linear series;2006-10-01 23:20:00;6 seconds;4 very large bright spherical objects -- one green, the others red or orange -- moving at high speeds upward in linear series 4 very large bright spherical objects -- one green, the others red or orange -- moving at high speeds in a linear series, apparently beginning from near the ground (in the mountains) moving almost straight upward. High cloud cover blocked my view of them after 5 or 6 seconds. I've never seen anything like this. I'm a philosophy professor at the University of Colorado. I'm very scientifically minded. My best guess is that the objects were part of some covert military operation. They were certainly not conventional aircrafts of any sort.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Spheres of light over local municipal airport;2009-04-01 01:15:00;ongoing;Spheres of light over local municipal airport I was relaxing having a cigarette not 100 yards from my house near a playground and looked up to look at the constellations. Since I live near the Boulder Municipal Airport when I saw two orbiting red spherical objects (they were orbiting each other) over in the west of where I live (which is slightly to the west of the airport) I called the police non-emergency line. As the phone was ringing I saw a slight flash of green come from the east. A solitary green sphere was floating right over where the airport is emitting occasional bursts of light. As I watched the three orb/spheres I told the police what was going on. Then I saw something I knew I should not tell them. The green orb detached two smaller green orbs that chased the two red orbs off to the north. When I went inside to email this off, the large green orb was still there. All the time there were aircraft passing by at normal flight altitudes but what I found disconcerting was the fact that I could not hear the trains I normally hear this time of night going by on the tracks just under half a mile away. So you know, I am a firm believer in UFOs and have twice before seen them but never this many in a single sitting, it has always been silver doughnut shaped UFOs before now and in pairs. Anyway I am a student and a retail sales person who is between jobs and schools. If you are wondering why I list a California address that is my permanent address and the address I live at now I am here for only a few more weeks. The address in Boulder at which this happened is 4832 Baldwin Place, Boulder, CO;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

2 huge Sphere-like tentacle stars stationary in lower SE and East sky.;2014-10-23 02:20:00;Steady went back to slee;2 huge Sphere-like &quottentacle stars&quot stationary in lower SE and East sky. Two identical sphere framework objects which appeared (inside the sphere shape tolook as if an octopus were splayed out like a star you could not see a definite sphere shape, rather a tentacle-looking star in constant tentacle-y movement which had an even sphere/star look to it).  It was huge, much larger than any satellite I've seen.  About the size of what a full moon looks like, perhaps just a little smaller.  The tentacles appeared red, but also shimmery whitish-gold light.  One appeared in the SE sky (45 degree angle from due East), and the other was 340 degrees, or 20 degrees N of due East).  Our condo complex endured an extensive planned power outage after lights came on at 11:15, I couldn't sleep. Found myself up at about 2:15-2:30 a.m., looked out a large window and noticed this.  I have heard reports that these objects hovered over our complex at one point in the evening (waiting for more info to confirm).;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Orb that split into two orbs.;2015-09-27 22:30:00;2 minutes;Orb that split into two orbs. Saw an orb moving over the skyline very quickly over the front range/36 in Boulder, then the orb split into two orbs.   First yellowish orb vanished after it split into two orbs about 5 seconds later.   The second orb, which was more reddish in color, vanished after about another 7 seconds.   Both maintained a straight flight path parallel to the ground and moved very quickly.   The sky was clear when the orbs just vanished.  No fast flying plane engine sounds were heard;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Shiny sphere, high altitude, moving steadily west before disappearing;2021-03-28 16:30:00;2 minutes;Shiny sphere, high altitude, moving steadily west before disappearing Walking westbound on Mayhoffer Singletree trail (approx. 39.957516193973746, -105.19582641562917). Spherical silver/shiny ball appeared to the west, above Eldorado Mountain, seemingly near cloud altitude, moving steadily west (no contrails). Moved in front of very feint clouds, and went dark/black, then promptly disappeared. We stopped and waited for it to appear, but it did not. This did not behave like a plane, nor like a mylar balloon.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Spikey Orb hovering. I thought it was a balloon. Came back and it was gone.;2021-08-08 20:28:00;2 min;Spikey Orb hovering. I thought it was a balloon. Came back and it was gone. Driving home at 8:28pm and here, above a field near home, about house height from the ground was a black, spiky looking orb. Looked like a sun shaped birthday balloon but it was black. No lights, no sound just hovering. I thought someone tethered a helium balloon in the field just behind their house. There was a bicyclist going the same way as us. We noticed him turn around, it must have been unusual for him too. We found an opportunity to turn around. We we got back to the main street and we saw the biciclist standing and looking back where it was. There was no object. I rolled down the window and said Was that a balloon? he said I don't know, it just disappeared. All of this happened in the span of 2 minutes.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
