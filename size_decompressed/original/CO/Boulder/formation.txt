All 3 objects were flying in the same heading. 1 followed by 2, 3 sec. later. I was sitting in my back yard witch has a great view of the front range of the Rocky mountians. I was on the phone looking up in the night sky. The moutian range is to the west of me and I am facing north. the first green light was headed in a southernly coarse. I mentioned to the person on the phone that I had seen a shooting star. Three seconds had passed and then two more green dots That were flying directly side by side flew along the same flight pattern . the last two lights flew on either side of the first one . the approximate alltitude was probably 50,000 ft.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Three black objects flying in close, diamond shaped formation.;1999-11-13 21:00:00;10 seconds;Three black objects flying in close, diamond shaped formation. Two friends and I were sitting in an open space watching for meteors and generally looking at the stars.  One of them pointed to an area of the sky and said What is that?  We all looked and saw what appeared to be 3 smallish objects flying in very tight formation.  The objects emitted no sound at all, and it was difficult to judge the altitude because none of the objects had any lights whatsoever.  Only the light pollution from the city illuminated them.  They flew very quickly from east to west.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
5 glowing golden cigar shaped discs moving in formation;2004-05-12 04:02:00;30 seconds;5 glowing golden cigar shaped discs moving in formation We were out to see the Space Station come over when 5 golden glowing discs, a bit larger than footballs and the same shape, came by us, over the roof, and out to parking lot where they disappeared.  They were moving fast and as if one unit but 5 different discs.  All were glowing gold and moved with no noise..;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Formation of 4. Greenish white Flying V & pyramid shape displayed.;2014-07-04 23:30:00;5-10 minutes;Formation of 4. Greenish white  Flying V & pyramid shape displayed. We were watching the fireworks of course, then between the show in Westminster & Denver 4 greenish white lights appeared.  They circled with each other, dancing, then formed a very articulate V shape pointing to earth, somewhere near Lafayette.  They descended toward the horizon, broke formation & regrouped in a perfect equilateral triangle, with one in the middle.  I assume it was a pyramid in the air.  They descended further toward the ground & then disappeared.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Husband and myself witnessed a line of star-like lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-24 04:40:00;15;At 4:40-458am my husband and myself witnessed a line of star-like lights That seemed to enter our atomosphere and move across the sky traveling south to north east. The lights were in a straight line formation, evenly spaced except every 8-10 lights, two were traveling almost abreast. They were moving at a steady speed. Definitely not aircraft. We thought satellite except for the numbers.  We believe there were 75-100!!  It was strange how the lights entered into our our view. Almost like they flew in through a port hole above Louisville Co. We are educated and not crazy.  This was weird.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
