Saw six bronze color flying triangles, no lights on, flying between the stars in Boulder CO, 1979.;1979-09-18 21:00:00;12 seconds;Saw six bronze color flying triangles, no lights on, flying between the stars in Boulder CO, 1979. We were returning to my friend's car after dinner.  It was in a parking lot off of Broadway.  The night had no moon.  The sky was inky black and the stars were bright.  He had been telling me about healing eye sight by looking into darkness daily.  I opened my eyes as wide as possible to drink in the cool dark night.  It was like a balm to my eyes.  I was looking west toward the mountains.   SUDDENLY, I saw six triangular craft to the north flying south.  They were so incredibly high.  They were the color of a bronze key and had no lights.  There were no windows...  And I could see them flying between the stars.  I was THRILLED and ecstatic!  I started jumping up and down yelling my friend's name and shouting, So and so, LOOK! LOOK! LOOK!   The triangles were flying in formation and as they flew their motion was as if riding waves.... and then the one from the back right flew forward and the front one seemed to fly back... or take up the back position...  They traversed from north to the south horizon in what seemed for ever but was very fast...  I was jubilant!  My friend did not see them.  I was sure that they were some new kind of airplane. Back at my place I re-enacted it and he timed it.... The sighting lasted about 12 seconds. Nine months later a good friend a school teacher told me that her husband had seen six flying triangles the previous night.  This was June 1980. In fall of 1997, I was living in Washington DC.  My son living in Boulder CO called me to say that he had seen 'Mom's six flying triangles with two of his friends.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
I observed a large triangular shaped object in 1983 in the same area and with identical characteristics described in a 2005 report.;1983-09-01 21:30:00;10 seconds;I observed a large triangular shaped object in 1983 in the same area and with identical characteristics described in a 2005 report. This report is submitted only after reading an existing report dated September 19, 2005.  I too was in Boulder Colorado, watching the night sky, at approximately 2130, in a park near Boulder Canyon.  There were only a few lights on at the time in the area so that my vision of the night sky was not obscured.  I too saw a very large (probably the size of a football field) triangular / boomerang shaped object cross the sky above me – going from west to east (I know because I was near the mountains and the object came from over the mountains).  It was very large, traveling surprisingly slow, and at an altitude I would guess to be less than 1,000 feet.  There was no sound associated with the craft, there were no lights visible at all, and it was very dark in color.  The only way I knew the craft was there was because I noticed it block out the stars above it as it passed in front of them directly above me.  I focused in on it and observed the very distinct outline of the craft and watched it maintain a straight course for 10 seconds until I lost sight of it as it passed directly over the City of Boulder.  It startled me so that I immediately went to a pay phone and called the Boulder Police Department.  Dispatch for the Boulder Police Department informed me that they had recently received over 20 calls already on the same observation.  This wasn’t 2005 as was the case of the report that has caused me to file this report – My experience was in 1983.  Unfortunately I don’t recall the exact day.  I can only guess that it was late in the year, very possibly September.  I do know that I saw a craft, however.   I had recently spent 4 years in the Navy and was familiar with every type of ‘publicly known’ military aircraft, and this fit the profile of none of them.  I have since gone on to develop a career in the Navy and have spent a great deal of time in a flying status.  To this day, I cannot identify a possible aircraft profile that I know of that is similar to what I saw in 1983. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Saw 3 lights moving slowly over the foothills;1997-10-15 19:00:00;5 min;Saw 3 lights moving slowly over the foothills I was watching movies at a Nonalcholic party for our Kung Fu Group.  My Friend called me outside to his front porch We saw a saucer shaped craft with 3 reddish orange lights in a triangle formation moving slowly southwards over the foothills near Boulder, CO.  The craft moved very slowly and made no sound.  It couldn't have been more than 1 mile away and must have been about 2000 feet altitude above us.  I've grown up with Airplanes my whole life and I feel I'm pretty good judge of these things.  We watched for a few minutes some of us watched thru a spotting scope.  It slowly moved into a cloud.  The Cloud was a fairly light wispy cloud and we could see it move in and out of the cloud. Then suddenly it vanished. I stayed out watching the cloud for nearly 45 minutes until the entire cloud dissapeared. The Cloud was not so large that I couldn't see it in it's entirity.  After 45 min or so nothing emerged from the cloud and the cloud had completely dissapated. At that time I quit looking.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Triangular constellation of star-like objects float silently across the sky at very high altitude.;2003-07-11 03:30:00;2-3 mins;Triangular constellation of star-like objects float silently across the sky at very high altitude. I was sleeping in my car on a hot summer night. I folded down the backseat and pressed the top of my head against the rear window, staring at the stars around Orion and across the Milky Way. Suddenly, there was a bright zip of light across the sky, it was a large meteor, leaving a beautiful contrail. a minute or two passed, still staring straight up. I thought I saw a starr moving, I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks on me. I squinted a couple times and focused more intently, there were three. They wwere the exact same magnitude, size and appeared to be distant stars, a constellation like that of Pisces. But, they glided slowly across the sky from south to north, never breaking formation. I got out of the car and stood in the middle of the dark street gazing to the north as the objects slowly disappeared on the horizon. I was so frightened, I drove straight home and climbed in bed ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness observed what are presumed to be the triplet of U.S. Navy NOSS satellites, which are often reported to NUFORC.  They fly in formation for several weeks, and them disappear, only to return months later.  PD));40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
UFO craft shaped triangular burn (1 x 3/8) on left wrist;2006-08-12 17:00:00;ongoing;UFO craft shaped triangular burn (1 x 3/8) on left wrist Though i've had UFO and ET contacts throughout my life, this experience did not include a sighting, but i was brought to your website to explore what happened and i've felt it to be ET/UFO related since the outset. Around 7 pm last Saturday, after a 2-hour phone meeting, i noticed a red triangle on my left hand about halfway between the  thumb and the wrist. It looked like a burn. The triangle is exactly 1 wide on bottom side and 3/8 from the center of this side to the top with both ends narrowing into a perfectly very thin point, particularly visible on the left (wrist) side. It looks just like a UFO! The  triangle seems burned on the skin but there is no pain, heat or blistering.  The bottom of the triangle (the widest side) looks or appears slightly curved down just like the shape of a craft seen in profile. Three days later it's slightly redder than it was that first day but otherwise unchanged. Have taken photos of it. This is not my first unexplained marking but it's the most artistic one!;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

A child and two adults were sitting in a hottub on a cold partly cloudy night. The 10 yr old boy looks up and points and screams, Whats that!? The adults looked but didnt see anything. He said it was flying to the south. The child said I just saw a UFO and he jumped out and ran inside scared to death. A few minutes later as the adults talked about how scared he looked, the child slowly comes back out and as we say,  Come back in it was probably just a shooting star, he points back up and says There it is! and we all looked and saw a huge V shaped triangle made up of redish, dull, illuminated sections flying north. It was flying low and silent and fast about 1000 feet up. We were all in shock and after a few minutes of staring at the sky. We all went inside in amazment. The boy said when it first came by it was rounded in the front not V shaped and had more lights and was flying lower.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

The craft appeared to be very large, about twice the size of a 747. Flying at about an estimated 5,000 feet, very fast. There was very little sound, no jet engine sounds, it silently flew at a very rapid pace. In the shape of a triangle this was a very odd sighting. The only sound was the air being moved in the sky.

A trangular craft with several, large, bright lights flew low and quick over the neighborhood;2010-01-08 23:00:00;40 seconds;A trangular craft with several, large, bright lights flew low and quick over the neighborhood My boyfriend was on his computer with no lights on in the room at the time.  The west facing window is directly behind his desk.  He saw bright lights and the motion sensitive outdoor lights in our neighborhood went on simultaniously. He opened the blinds and began to yell for me,  ..Come look! Hurry!   I was too late to see it from the front (west) side of the house, so we went across to the east facing back door and we both observed the object travelling extremely low and quickly towards the southeast. It appeared triangular in shape with several large lights.  It seemed to be comparative huge to normal aircraft.  It was definitely not a helicopter, by the size, shape, and lack of sound.  He said he heard some sound from the object, but I did not.  If it were a helicopter it would have been very loud.  They vibrate the house.   We do not live in a flight path and do not usually see planes.  Aircraft from the Boulder Airport does not seem to take off or land over where our house is located.  The airport is north of our location. We just don’t see aircraft and neither of us have ever observed anything like it.   It happened too quickly to grab the camera phone.   We are scientists by nature, so we are just curious if anyone else reported the craft and if there is a valid explanation.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
V-shaped craft flying southwest over Boulder CO;2012-04-10 20:10:00;6-8 seconds;V-shaped craft flying southwest over Boulder CO I was sitting on my porch, having a cigarette, and looking up at the sky. It is a cloudy night, and there was a patch of sky without clouds.  I was looking at the stars I could see through that patch. From the northeastern part of that patch, I noticed what looked like a bright wisp of clouds moving at a steady rate southwest.  It was behind the clouds, however, and moving much quicker than any cloud, and it was not windy. I then realized it was in the shape of a perfect V, so I looked closer, and noticed it was nothing like I had ever seen.  I could tell that it was somewhere just above the cloud cover, and it looked as if it were a typical V-shaped UFO with its lights off.  As it moved away, I noticed the V-shape, from my perspective, now looked like a straight line.  That is when it disappeared behind thick clouds once more.  I hoped to see another opening in the clouds farther on, so as to see it again, but the clouds got thicker towards the mountains, the direction it was going.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

Boulder CO Triangle/Chevron Object.;2012-11-07 23:45:00;5 seconds;Boulder CO Triangle/Chevron Object Having recently witnessed an orange fireball object on 11/3/12, I was a little reluctant to report this new sighting.  However I felt compelled because my sighting was very similiar to another report in Boulder this month.  I was walking my dog at the Howard Hueston dog park last evening when I spotted an object that appeared to be a triangle or chevron shaped object.  It was extremely difficult to see.  It appeared to have deep red tones on the body of the object, it may have also had about 4 very dim lights on the leading edge of the object.  The object was silent and appeared to be gliding in the sky.  The object was heading west, then turned at a 45 degree angle and headed to the north.  I lost sight of the object when it went into tree line.  It is also important to note that this park is very close to Glenwood Dr similiar location to the other Boulder triangle report.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

I was on the highway in my car, when me and a group of people saw a huge blue triangle object flying over the city.  It looked like a stealth bomber, a flying wing.  But it had circular tubes sticking out of the end.  Most of the other people mistake it as a kite, but it was too large.  It was hard to see rough the forested park, but it continued flying northwest before passing over the mountains and disappearing.  There was no response from most of the cars and people, who continued driving or walking.  It scared me, but I suppose people thought it was a kite or military aircraft.  Maybe they thought it was a weather ballon from NCAR?  It scared me and I still wonder today.  Birds migrated throughout the city and they seemed scared.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

I have heard of other people reporting these v shaped flying wings and was very excited that I got to see one.  I tracked it for about 5 seconds then it was gone, they make no noise so it's very hard to pick up on them you have to only look with your eyes, I believe that is how they go undetected as they are completely quiet and move very fast but graceful through the night sky's.

Preface:  I understand submitting this 2 years later may show little merit. My friend and I both saw this craft, I did not report it to the authorities and have only informed my family and close friends and have been labeled a loony on this topic. I grew up flying glider airplanes and have been a hobby aviationist my entire life.  I am knowledgeable on the topics of aircraft mechanisms and modes of lift. This event has burned itself into my mind and I cannot let it go.  I discovered this website today.  What is prompting me to share my story is the report located at http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/130/S130339.html   as it matches my sighting nearly exactly and is only a few days separate from my friend and I's experience. At approximately 03:15 I was standing outside in the ally way of my friend’s apartment with another friend who was smoking a cigarette.  I was star gazing as I am from the midwest and the elevation of Boulder offers a unique and clear view of the stars I am not often afforded back home.  While gazing up I noticed that suddenly stars began disappearing.  As more and more stars were blotted out I was able to make out that a large, pitch black, distinctively solid Triangular craft that was moving North to South at a slow speed at what I estimated to be 500-800ft directly above my friend and I. Startled, I grabbed my friend who was also able to make out the craft as well when I pointed to it and indicated its heading.  The craft was initially only seen by me as I had been peering at the stars in the exact location that it began to fly over us.  If this had not been the case I would have missed it entirely. The craft was a solid Triangle shape with 3 incredibly dim red/rust diffuse lights on each of its 3 corners. In the middle of the triangle was a larger, yet still very dim, blue-ish/purple diffuse glow.  I know this craft was a solid Triangle and not a boomerang shape as the stars blotted out were consistent with a complete triangle.  It maintained its direction with no spin or wobble with 1 of the dim red/rust lights “leading” or being the “front” of the craft. The craft slowly moved over us at a constant speed and over the apartments on the other side of the alleyway in a North to South heading.  If I had to estimate the speed of the craft I would put it between 50-90mph.  The craft was COMPLETELY silent.  Once past us the craft showed no engines or engine glow on the rear of the craft like a traditional airplane would.  The event lasted approximately 8-12 seconds.  I did not attempt to capture any footage as I knew my cellphone camera was garbage and did not want to risk looking at my bright screen and losing my view of the craft. I would not have shared my experience publicly if I had not seen the aforementioned report and the uncanny similarities between the two. The eeriness of the silence was what really startled me. Even a glider at that low of altitude produces the whooshing sound of wind passing over its wings.  I spent the rest of my vacation pointing out to my friend who experienced the event with me how the sounds of jets passing thousands of feet overhead can easily be heard and how bizarre and unique our experience was.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

It flew in a straight direction but seemed to vanish at an angle I assume is 45 degrees from my vantage point.  It was a dark color but was visible because of its dim lights.  It seemed to be flying low and if so was very silent and not very large so there was no possibility it was a drone.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
