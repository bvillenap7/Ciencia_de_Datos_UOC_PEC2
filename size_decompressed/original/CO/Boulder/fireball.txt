While walking south a large comet like object swept out of the sky and turned horizonel at about a thousand feet from the ground and headed west disappearing at the point it would have hit the mountain. The object looked like what I thought for many years was a metiorite. It had a hot molten look to it with a firey like tail. I was amazed when it didn't hit the mountain. It flew the length of the Boulder Mall, a very busy place and there was never any mention of it so I just kept quiet. Until I learned that these fire balls have been reported as possiblely vehicles. The point at which it disappeared would be Pearl St. at the base of boulder canyon. The Ball seemed to have a crator like surface.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
01/11/01 fireball over western skies was different color and headed in a different direction.;2001-01-11 21:30:00;5sec;01/11/01 fireball over western skies was different color and headed in a different direction. Just an addendum to the coverage from the AP of the fireball seen on Thursday evening. The report from the AP states The helicopter crew spotted the fireball while flying about 30 miles east of Greeley. The light came from the east, around the Nebraska-Colorado border. But what we witnessed (just happened to have just reached the top of Bear Peak and were looking out across the plains toward Denver) was definitely traveling east and came from the west along a trajectory more like Salt Lake/Denver than Nebraska/Colorado. The glow from the illuminated gases around the object were bright enough to light up my face and allow one of my friends to realize and turn around and catch the end of the spectacle. Also, the AP story states that the observers in Sydney saw a blue fireball. Our observations were definitely of a bright green fireball. Not sure the exact length. I'm guessing around five seconds. Very amazing.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

The object was silent. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be unusually eloquent and sober-minded in his description of the event.

Two other cars were nearby and stopped to ask us if we just saw that.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

About 4 minutes to Boulder I see a big, bright orange, fire ball floating low in the sky. I literally put my hazard lights on and pulled over on the major highway to get out and look at it. I tried taking a video and I thought it was going successful until I got back into my car and the video was messed up. I was shook and excited by the experience. The fireball moved quickly and was very close the the land-comparitively to any air craft. It also made absolutely no noise.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
