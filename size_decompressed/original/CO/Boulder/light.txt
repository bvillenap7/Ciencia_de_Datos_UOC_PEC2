Three Stars Begin to Move Randomly, Stop, Change Direction, Move Again, And Then Vanish;1988-10-10 22:00:00;1 minute;Three Stars Begin to Move Randomly, Stop, Change Direction, Move Again, And Then Vanish I've recounted this story many times to many people over the years, but have only just found this site (6-27-06).  It's important to note that I've had similar sightings to this one two other times, all with witnesses.  I'll just put them all on this one posting.  First Sighting:  The happened way back when I was in highschool, about 1988.  The location from which we made the sighting was in the mountains above Boulder, Colorado, in the parking lot of the Bald Mountain hiking area.  I was parking with a girl I was dating at the time.  It was about 10pm.  We decided to stand up in the back of my car and put our heads out of the sunroof to look at the stars.  It was a clear night.  Looking northward, we just stargazed for a few minutes.  I then noticed three stars that seemed to be in a perfect equalateral formation, about 75 degrees above the horizon, fairly close together (if you hold your hand out at arm's length, they would be about the distance apart of 1 between thumb and forefinger).  I just looked at them for about 30 seconds, and mentioned them to my companion.  She looked at them.  Then they started to move in apparently random directions, each one in a straight line, only a few degrees, and then they'd stop.  Then they'd move again for a few seconds, and then stop.  Then they all started moving about 1-o'clock from their position, still in a clear triangle formation, but not equalateral.  They accelerated in that direction, and vanished.  We were stunned!  We both saw the whole thing.  We were both totally sober, too.  A year or so later, I saw a very similar thing, this time with two other sober witnesses, from the top of Flagstaff Mountain in Boulder, at night.  Later, about 1991, I again made a similar sighting, this time with another two sober witnesses, while walking in North Boulder park at night.  Geosynchronous-orbit satellites do NOT look like what I saw.  Neither do faster-moving satellites that move counter to the rotation of the earth.  Stars do NOT start moving and then stop and then move in different directions and then disappear.  I know that some people would say that what I saw were military planes, but that's not true.  They were VERY distant and looked just like stars.  Military planes do NOT move like what I saw.  I know that it's hard to determine distance at night (or even in the daytime) of objects you see, but I have a good spacial sense and I know what I saw.  These were NOT normal astral events.  This sighting is VERY similar to one seen from Twin Peaks in San Francisco that I saw in the database, but can't find now!  Anyway, there are numerous cases similar to this one in the database.

Glowing light in early night sky becomes two, then back to one, glows brightly then implodes over I-36 Boulder-Denver turnpike.;1996-09-01 18:30:00;20 minutes;Glowing light in early night sky becomes two, then back to one, glows brightly then implodes over I-36 Boulder-Denver turnpike. In the car on I-36 heading to Denver.  My friend was driving her new Subaru Outback on the highway for the first time, so I was not talking much as I wanted her to pay attention.  We are heading south no far outside of Boulder, perhaps approaching Superior.  In 1996 the area was not built up, so it was dark.  I am in the front passenger seat.  Up ahead to my right, above the ground quite a ways is a light in the sky.  Is it a star I ask myself?  I decide that it is a warning light for airplanes. But, no, it is too high up.  Then it becomes two lights... and there seems to be a silver glowing line under them.... I am still watching... the car is rolling along smoothly... the lights seem to glow brighter.  I decide to ask my friend if she can see it... She does.  We wonder if it is an airplane coming toward us?  But the light does not get closer and there are no red blinking lights that would be on the wings and underbelly of a plane... I see the two lights now merge and become one... the line underneath vanishes....  We are both watching.... and then it seems that the light glows bright and suddenly it implodes and is gone.  We turned and looked at each other and simultaneously said, That was weird!  There was no report about it in the paper... it was seen and then gone. In the morning, I talked to her husband about it since he was a pilot of small planes. He had no idea of what it could be.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
June 17, 1999 Bright capsul shaped object which I thought was a star brightened and took off, then disappeared.;1999-06-17 22:00:00;5 seconds;June 17, 1999 Bright capsul shaped object which I thought was a star brightened and took off, then disappeared. On June 17, 1999 at 2200hrs I stepped outside for a break with a co-worker and was making a comment on how clear the sky was because it had been cloudy all week. When I looked up in the sky exactly above my head I had my eye on bright star and a couple of others in the area one of them moved. I am not sure now that it was a star. The object was not very bright but when it started to move it grew in length and width it was the shape of a capsule like a pill, it got VERY bright and it moved a short distance and then it started to dim and just blinked out. It was moving north from south and it was straight up from where I was standing facing north. When I first saw this I said, wow and my co-worker looked up and saw the object disappear. I thought it may have been a shooting star but it didn't streak and it didn't look like other shooting stars I have seen before. This object moved and brightened up like it was building energy to move very fast. The object was very high in the sky and appeared to be close to the stars.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Very fast object over boulder;1999-08-15 17:30:00;2 min;Very fast object over boulder I was driving home from work and got on east bound Highway 52 from the Diagonal.  It was a clear summer day, not a cloud in the sky.  I saw a bright white or reflective object very high in the sky, I would say 30,000 feet or about the same height as commercial airliners.  What made this object unusual was its size and speed.  Although I couldnt make any detail out of it I could tell it wasnt very big.  Its speed was what i found amazing.  For me the best way to describe it is to be standing behind a missile as it was lauched off a airplane and all you could see was the orange glow of its thrust as it dissapear, it moved that fast.  except this object didnt have a orange glow, no smoke or no contrails.  I watched this object dissapear over the horizon, the hole event only lasted a little over a minute. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
small light grows extemelt bright and then dissapears.;2001-08-12 04:00:00;30 min;small light grows extemelt bright and then dissapears. Last nite a friend and I went up into the mountains to watch the meteor shower. I kept noticing this star that seemed to be moving from north to south. I figured it was probably a sattelite, and thus didn't pay too much attention to it. Although, several minutes later I noticed it in a completely different part of the sky and still moving from north to south. It was hard to keep track of because it was so small and dim. I gave up on trying to keep track of it after a while, and then all of the sudden it started growing in brightness, and for a second it was the brightest thing in the sky. After this brightness dissapated, the light kept moving in the same direction and dissapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Report is consistent with the flare of an Iridium satellite.

Glowing orbs sighted at University of Colorado at Boulder;2002-09-02 20:00:00;20 seconds;Glowing orbs sighted at University of Colorado at Boulder I was lying on my back in a soccer field on the campus of CU Boulder. I was talking on my cellular telephone and glancing at the stars. Two spheres of orange glowing light appeared in the sky from the south east. They appeared to be at a great altitude and were miving extremely fast. one sphere was slightly ahead of the other in a small formation, and then the following orb sped up and passed the first. After about ten seconds they had moved completely out of sight to the northwest. The speed, precision maneuvering, and brightness were unlike anything i have ever witnessed in the sky before.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Object avoids jets contrail, stops and changes direction;2004-06-15 14:00:00;3-4 minutes;Object avoids jets contrail, stops and changes direction While taking a break at the picture window at the north end of my floor at work today, I watched a passenger jet flying at altitude to the east, leaving a typical contrail. It was several miles away but the outline and wings were still easily visible. As I continued watching, I noticed a white object approaching it from the southeast.  Assuming it was another plane too far away to show any detail, I didn't think much of it.  However, when it approached the jet, it changed course in a wide arc underneath the jet's contrail, then continued to the west. Once or twice during it's flight, a flash of light glinted off it implying it may have been metallic.  At this point I called for 2 women who were in the cubicles closest to the window to see the object.  They came over and watched for a few seconds, and after approximately 1 minute, the object stopped in the middle of the sky and reversed direction back to the east. No arc, or 180° turn or quick bank, just stopped and started travelling back east.  When I saw it stop and change direction I became very excited, though the women with me weren't impressed even though they also saw it stop and reverse course.  I continued to watch the object fly east till it was lost in a developing cloud formation.  It was roughly 2:00 p.m. (I forgot to look at my watch for the exact time of course), the weather was sunny to the northwest but became cloudy to the east due to a developing thunderstorm system coming over the mountains, and the sky behind the object looking north was blue. I was inside so I could hear no noise, but I assume it was too far away to hear anything at that distance if I was outside. Seeing as it was several miles to the northeast from my vantage point, I estimate the general location of the object would have been high in the sky above the line dividing Larimer and Boulder county in northern Colorado.  I will email an edited photo of the view from the window after I send this report.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

Seven orange lights in the north sky at night gradually faded away.;2007-12-15 21:15:00;10 minutes;Seven orange lights in the north sky at night gradually faded away. We saw 7 orangish lights in the sky to the north, moving around slowly, staying in the same general area.  Soon 1 faded out of sight, and gradually another faded, then another.  After about 10 minutes all had faded away.  They did not appear to be projected, but they seemed to be a light source. At first we thought they might have been remnants of a recently shot firework, but they lingered too long for that.  We speculated they could have been weather ballons, with flames heating the air to fill the balloons, but they were too far away to see any balloon or flame shape.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Light or small object, drifting slowly E-W on a clear afternoon. No sudden maneuvers, flew v. slowly.;2009-03-14 14:15:00;10-15 min.;Light or small object, drifting slowly E-W on a clear afternoon. No sudden maneuvers, flew v. slowly. I observed a possible UAP (UFO) over S. Boulder, Colorado about 1415 MDT (GMT - 6) on 14 Mar 09.  I was out enjoying the sun when I noticed a light or silvery object (a point) drifting very slowly to the W.  It passed overhead about 1415 and finally disappeared behind the trees.  It did not perform any of the sudden maneuvers often reported of UAPs, such as darting off at extreme speed it just slowly traversed the sky.  Size, height, speed unknown. It left no trail, did not flash, etc. A star or planet, or even a spacecraft such as the ISS?  Not likely.  It was too bright to be the former and S/C are usually launched to the E. to take advantage of the Earth's rotation, so fly W-E.  They also usually go much faster, in angular velocity.  Not a jet it went too slowly. Weather balloon?  Possibly.  Wind here has been light NE all day (as usual) but winds are usually W. at higher altitudes.  It did not seem to slow down or get fainter as it would if it had been climbing.  It could also have been a UAV (pilotless drone airplane), very high or flying very slowly.  It jogged to the N. a bit then continued drifting W. Location observed from: ~Lat. 40° N., Long. 105° 15' W. (just N. of Baseline Road near 29th Street in S. Boulder), el. ~1625 m. (5330').

Large round, fiery looking light flying slowly from south to north over Boulder, Colorado at 21:17 MST 06-20-09.;2009-06-20 21:17:00;3-5 minutes;Large round, fiery looking light flying slowly from south to north over Boulder, Colorado at 21:17 MST 06-20-09. There were four of us were sitting in a hot tub enjoying the late evening of June 20, 2009 when we all noticed a very bright round light moving slowly from south to north over southern Boulder, Colorado (roughly 21:17 pm).  The light looked like it was coming from something burning.  It had a red-orange color and was not blinking or fading.  It appeared to be 20-30,000 feet high and was flying slowly.  It made a couple of small turns to the left and right, but mainly followed a path from south to north.  At one point it stopped moving and remained stationary for a minute or so.   It then appeared to fly straight vertically fairly rapidly and the large round fiery looking light grew smaller and smaller until it finally disappeared completely.  The entire viewing time was three to five minutes in length. There was not a tail of flames, just a large round light with the color of something burning.  If it was 20-30,000 feet up, the size of the object would have been very large (many hundreds of feet in diameter if not 1,000’).  It may have been closer to the ground though since all we could see was a large light, definitely not a point source.   Also, at no point could we see any other object than the light.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

Bright lights seen pulsating over east Colorado.;2010-10-15 19:30:00;2 hours;Bright lights seen pulsating over east Colorado. At around 7:30 pm a friend called letting us know that there were weird lights in the sky.  3 friends and I went out to look at the lights, when we went out we saw about 4 bright lights towards the north east about 15 degrees above the horizon.  The lights were moving back and forth between each other and pulsating red, yellow, blue and, green.  They would fly close to each other and then at high speeds, fly away.  Every few minutes one or two of the lights would get extremely bright emit other lights. After about 15 minutes of watching the lights i called the sheriffs office of Boulder County and reported the sighting.  A few minutes later one of the local deputies called me back and said there had been multiple reports in the area of the same lights.  The deputy then told me that he was driving out to east Longmont to check out the lights for himself.  A few minutes after hanging up with the sheriff my friend called back and said that he had talked to another dep! uty who said he saw the lights and called the FAA(Federal Aviation Association)who said they had gotten three reports from from sheriffs offices around Colorado who said they had also gotten multiple reports.  The FAA then said they scanned the area with radar and got 3 blips for a few seconds then the blips flew below the radar.  They also said that they hadn't determined if they were going to scramble jets yet.  The entire encounter lasted about 2 hours.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
3 lights moved past a streak that was left by an airplane but the lights were very very far away.;2011-04-16 00:00:00;15 minutes;3 lights moved past a streak that was left by an airplane but the lights were very very far away. I had just watched the UFO disclosure video and thought it would be interesting to see if I could find anything, but I definitely did NOT expect to see anything at all.  I was on the Colorado University Campus and lay down on a bench while on the phone with my friend and was just looking up at the sky when an airplane flew by and left a streak in the sky.  I landed my eye on that streak so I would have a point of reference and saw these 2 lights that were definitely above the airplane streak move. They both moved in a semi straight line, past the streak and then stopped.   I then spotted a third one moving toward the airplane streak, but it did not pass it. Those 3 lights lined up in a straight line.    After spotting those, I tried to look for others, and thought I saw things moving, but the streak had faded, so I didn't know if my eyes were playing tricks on me. But I know that I saw those 3 lights move, and they were too far away to be a plane.  After a while, the lights very quickly moved upward and disappeared to my sight.  I'm amazed that I was able to see something just by trying to look for it.   Incredible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

4 bright lights observed for 3 hours above Boulder/Lafayette, CO with repeated movements as if surveying the land. ((Planets??  PD));2012-07-22 03:00:00;3 hours;Four bright lights observed for 3 hours above Boulder/Lafayette, CO with repeated movements as if surveying the land. My boyfriend and I were walking back from a friend’s house early Sunday morning around 3:00 am.  The night sky was very visible with only a few scattered clouds.  It was not until we were about two blocks from our apartment when I looked up at the Eastern horizon and notices a star that was extremely bright and much larger than any other star I had ever seen.  It was located beneath the stars, not in any constellation.  Its brightness was about 4 times a bright as all of the other stars as well as 4 times bigger.   At first we thought we were witnessing a Super Nova of some kind but soon realized that that was not the case. We had stopped to watch and admire this possible Super Nova when all of a sudden the object (star) Shifted, moved to the left.  It was at this time that we realized this was NOT a super nova.  We continued to watch the object as we ran back the rest of the two blocks.  When we returned home we woke up the others in the house and all climbed up on the roof of our apartment to watch what was going on.  It was also then that we noticed the other three, slightly less bright, objects moving in the sky. Each of the four objects followed the same movement patters:   The object would be completely stationary for a few min. and then move slowly to the left or right. Hover there for a few min. and the begin almost bouncing back and forth, Left and right, before it stopped and hovered stationary again. After it completed both the movements described above, it would then begin to spin. You could tell this due to the way the light was moving. All of these movements were repeated over and over in the same order for about 3 hours -	They did not stay in any specific formation, almost like they were individually surveying the land  The description of what the objects looked like: -	The brightness of each object was not the same this was due to them being at different distances from my roof top. One would grow brighter as it moved towards my location, while others would get dimmer -	The objects would go from dim to very bright in only a few seconds. I took photographs on my phone of the objects and when zoomed in, looks like they are simply white spherical Balls  I continued to watch this phenomenon for the entirety of its performance. After three hours of watching their actions the sun began to rise. As the sun began to peak over the horizon, the objects slowly began to move out of the atmosphere. However, two stayed behind for a very long time. I watched as one took about 15 min. to move up and up out of visible view. The last one followed shortly after the sun had completely come above the horizon. The entire three hours I was not sure whether to be terrified, amazed, or excited. I was trembling the entire time. A little background on myself:  Born and Raised in Kansas City, I moved out to Boulder only this past January after finishing by Business Management Degree at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland OH. I am of very sound mind and have steady employment here in Boulder, CO. I am positive that this was not a natural phenomenon.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
4 orange lights hovering above/near Rocky Flats former nuclear weapons plant.;2012-11-06 18:00:00;1-2 minutes;4 orange lights hovering above/near Rocky Flats former nuclear weapons plant On November 6, 2012, at approximately 6pm MDT, after voting at Centennial Middle School, my wife and I were walking back to our home in north Boulder.  At the intersection of 19th and Norwood, which is located at the top of a steep hill that faces south, we observed 4 bright lights near the southern horizon.  The lights were located on a bearing just east of south, probably about 170 degrees.  They were all the same brightness, evenly spaced, and resembled sodium vapor street lights they were orange in color.  They were no more than 5 degrees above the horizon from our vantage point. The lights were stationary during the minute or so that we viewed them. My wife is an adamant skeptic regarding UFOs.  Nonetheless, she readily admitted these lights looked &quotweird&quot.  My wife and I both have bachelor's degrees in physics and we have both studied astronomy at the university level, including considerable observational experience.  Neither of us thought these lights looked &quotnormal&quot. I have a private pilot's license and I am familiar with the location and traffic patterns of all airports in the vicinity of Boulder.  Our line-of-sight to the unknown lights passed near the traffic pattern for the Rocky Mountain Regional Airport (RMRA) (formerly the Jefferson County Airport or &quotJeffco&quot). However I do not think these were conventional aircraft landing lights because  1) they were distinctly orange and not white  2)  because normally we do not see landing lights from aircraft in the pattern at RMRA since the downwind leg for runway 29 R&L points *away* from Boulder  3) because there were *4* of them, all identical, evenly spaced, and they did not change their appearance at all during the minute or so we were observing them. Normally, conventional aircraft landing lights only take on an unusually bright appearance (such as we observed) when they happen to be pointed directly at the observer, a condition that normally happens for only a few seconds when an aircraft is maneuvering in the pattern.  I was unable to imagine any plausible arrangement of conventional aircraft in the landing pattern that would produce the display of lights we observed. In addition I should mention that the line-of-sight from us to the unknown lights passed more or less directly over the former Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility.  The lights (if taken to be similar in brightness to aircraft landing lights) looked as though they were located right over the former nuclear facility.  Although Rocky Flats has not been used for nuclear weapon production in many years, the author is aware that UFOs are often sighted near sensitive military installations, and thus thought that this detail should be included in this report. I was conflicted about whether to file this report or not, since we do have a large amount of conventional air traffic in our area at nearly all times, and therefore it is conceivable that what we saw was an unusual configuration of conventional aircraft.  However I decided to submit this report because I have thought about this sighting a number of times since it happened and I really am at a loss to explain those lights in a conventional manner.  Also, I reasoned that perhaps others saw these lights and may have already reported them, or, if not, perhaps my report will catalyze others into coming forward with corroborating information.  As far as I know there has been no mention in the local media about such lights, but I did not do a thorough search to confirm this.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

Saw a bright, star-light like one finger's length away from noonday sun in Boulder, clear skies.;2014-09-14 12:30:00;15 minutes;Saw a bright, star-light like one finger's length away from noonday sun in Boulder, clear skies. While waiting for a meeting to start, I happened to look up at the sun during a beautiful, cloudless day in Boulder.  I saw a bright object--like a star--about one finger’s length from the sun, my finger one foot from my nose.  I observed it for 5 or 6 minutes, during which time it never moved.  The bright light was stationary.  Because the light did not move, I concluded that it was not any sort of ordinary aircraft (not a helicopter by any means, and no noise whatsoever), nor was it a balloon, because high altitude winds would cause it to move.  The light looked just like a star.  But, how could a star be visible shortly after noon, in a cloudless sky, a finger’s length from the blazing sun?  I have never seen a star under such conditions. 	A man and woman came walking by while I was mulling over the possibilities. I stopped them, to see if they would have a look at the bright object.  They did so, but neither knew what it might be.  One reason I asked them to look was to verify that I was seeing something, and that its nature was not evident. 	After watching it for 8 or 9 minutes, I went inside, but the meeting had not yet started, so I went out again to see check on the light.  It was still there, its position the same.  I was stumped. 	My conclusion: Something very curious was up there, but I have no idea what it might have been.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639

Lights move across the sky and then disappear, one by one.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-05 19:00:00;5 minutes;Lights move across the sky and then disappear, one by one I went outside to let my dog out and saw evenly spaced lights moving though the sky West to East. They would arrive at the Big Dipper constellation and disappear one by one. There was not a cloud in the sky, as you could see the stars. I called for my partner to come out and she witnessed as well. If it were planes they were flying very high. Could they have been turning in the same location to make their lights no longer visible?;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
Caught a strobe of bright orange light from a dim light then noticed 4-5 other dim lights moving left to right. ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-21 21:00:00;15 minutes;came out for a smoke @ 9pm and caught a strobe of bright orange light from a dim light then noticed 4-5 other dim lights moving left to right then one started rising sratght up then another one followed it.  we saw the strobe 3 times.  then they stationary ones just seemed to fade off into the distance!  would guess they were a 100 miles away?  did not see anything unusual where the two rose straight up expecting a mother ship.  I hope other people were able to witness it!;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
White dot moving/stopping with a purple tinge for 30 minutes high in sky;2020-05-24 02:30:00;30 minutes;White dot moving/stopping with a purple tinge for 30 minutes high in sky My girlfriend and I were stargazing at about 2:30 am on a field with good skies. Fast moving clouds temporarily blocked view after about 20 minutes but otherwise good conditions. We noticed a light somewhat brighter than any star in sky was moving erratically directly above us. Returning to almost exactly overhead and stopping many times, moving in all directions and changing, but did not seem like a helicopter. Difficult to gauge height from ground or size. Seemingly subsonic speeds, but otherwise difficult to gauge speed without distance. Did not make any noticeable sound. There was a faint deep purple tint to the highest and wispiest clouds around it. Did not know if it was between the highest clouds and us or behind them, but was above the lowest and fastest moving clouds when they came in. We took several videos on our phones, but it was hard to make out a reference point or star in the videos so the camera footage is questionable unfortunately. It was ! larger than any star in the sky, and the light did not look exactly like a point source. It was almost like a light strip but far away. It pulsated occasionally with slightly brighter white and was purple on and off around wispy clouds (sometimes it did not give off the purple glow). Went inside eventually because we got cold.;40.0217727272726;-105.258365102639
