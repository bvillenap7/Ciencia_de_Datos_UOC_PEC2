It was constant and happened every other second. Every other light flash was dimmer and the other brighter. We tried to think of very possible explanation which is why I am 3 days late.  While I was thinking of what it could be I dozed off and when I woke up 20 mins later It was gone. We bot agreed the light looked to be At least a few thousand feet in the air. That day we drove to where we though it was and there was a mountain a few hundred feet.;40.2268;-105.8647
