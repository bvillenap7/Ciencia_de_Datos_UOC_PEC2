While on vacation in Grand Lake, Colorado, I was standing outside talking with two construction workers also staying at our motel when one looked up and said, What is that? I then looked up and saw a cigar shaped craft(silver in color} with a dome on top perhaps made of glass. It glided into the clouds.   It had a row of windows through the center and it looked like each window was separated by black frames.  There was one single light in the middle that was pulsating.   We heard a  humming sound.
