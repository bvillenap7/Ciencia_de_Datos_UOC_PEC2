Mis-shapen, slow moving Colorado Object.;2014-10-01 20:00:00;15-20 seconds;Mishapen, slow moving Colorado Object. The object was small, about the size of a soccer ball or basketball. It was a dark mass that held a shape that had no sharp corners and yet wasn’t round. It possessed a unique color that seemed to mimic camouflage, but each shade of brown, gray and black was unique to certain protrusions or forms this object held. There were no lights on it. It moved from about 50 feet above the neighborhood street, over the line of homes and into the fields to the east of the homes where I lost sight of it. Its movement was slow, smooth, steady, and yet at certain times it would change, dipping down and then to one side or the other, never changing its orientation or “facing” direction. There was one section that did protrude further than the rest and it was this section that was always facing the direction of travel. There were no sounds from this object and due to the calm weather it would’ve been easy, at that small distance, to hear any sounds.  The total time of observation wasn’t more than 15-20 seconds. I’ll email a rough drawing of this object with the title of “black object”.;40.095;-104.9378
