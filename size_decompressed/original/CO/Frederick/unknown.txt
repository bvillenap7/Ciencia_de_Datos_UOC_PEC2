Myself and two friends were outside in the back yard smoking a cigerratte. We went inside becuase it got dark and chilly. As soon as we walked in one of my friends said he felt something weird by the door. I stood by the door and felt the breeze but nothing else. He stood by the door again but he said he felt a painless, pulsating throb in his head with a sort of hum. I stood by the door but felt nothing. We forgot about the incident and sat down to watch TV. About a half hour later we saw a large flash outside the window it was either blue or green. It was so bright it felt like several cars were in the backyard with their brights on. This light was also accompanied by a loud and low hum that rattled the kitchen window and a painless electric feeling on the couches we were sitting on. This lasted for a solid 5 to 10 seconds. We ran outside thinking lightning struck the house, nothing was burnt not their was any clouds in the sky. We noticed about half a mile away from the house was a white suv that was motionless in the middle of the road and then proceeded slowly on its way as if it had seen something. We went to the front yard for about 15 minutes duting this time a neighbor that said he lived about a quarter mile away asked if we had seen it. We told him what we saw and he said he thought it was in his backyard as well. Shortly after we saw a young kid with a flashlight looking around telepone poles stating he also saw a blue light out side his window.;40.095;-104.9378
