We went on a late drive up mount Herman road, parked there for about a hour I was telling my wife iv felt strange things before up there around that neck of the woods above air force academy on the lookout point and I was telling her how people have seen things in the sky up there I wanna saw it was like 1:15 and off to our left this red/white light brighter then iv ever seen and believe me I work around high pressure sodium bulbs all day long and nothing I have ever seen was this bright.   It moved very silent the atmosphere around us changed to still air almost stale air it moved I wanna say 20 maybe 30 miles in literally a blink of an eye my wife said it's moving and all of a sudden it was hovering about 60 yards off to the left of us once I said let's follow it poof gone never saw anything again I drove home a changed man speechless I'm from highlands ranch just a 1 am bored trip changed my life.;39.1004;-104.8548
