Silent black triangular object in sky;2019-07-19 17:00:00;2 mins;Silent black triangular object in sky I saw a black object moving about 1000 ft above ground. It made no sound and I thought it might be a paraglider. It sort of floated across the landscape. I could hear jets also but did not see any. That noise did not come from the object though. Object was triangular and black and looked a little like an angel (2 wings). I watched it move west to east and looked away for an instant and it vanished. It was not scary, but I am not sure what it was. This happened in a rural area.;39.1004;-104.8548
