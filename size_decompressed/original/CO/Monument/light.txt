I looked at this one in particular, then it started to move.  It moved like a fruit fly.  Hoovering around.  I knew it couldn't be a plane because it would also stay in one spot then sway around.  The Physical desciption liked like light but it was oddd.  it looked like a crystal that someone was holding a flashlight behind, it shined in that way.  the body of the (craft)?  looked to be as big as a star but the crystal like shining surrounding it extended maybe six star lengths around it in all directions.  I just saw it right before i am writing this.  It freaked me out.;39.1004;-104.8548
