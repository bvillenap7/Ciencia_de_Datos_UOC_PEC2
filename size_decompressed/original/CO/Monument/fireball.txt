Fireball-like objects over Monument, Colorado.;2013-12-26 18:00:00;12-13 minutes;Fireball-like objects over Monument, Colorado. It was dark and we  were stopped at a stop sign facing north, towards monument hill.  We watched fireballs ascending from what looks like the mountains, maybe even Monument proper, but it was dark.  They were evenly spaced, one behind another finite ally moving east from the mountains but made a gradual turn north.   They didn't appear to be going fast but disappeared quickly.  The 4th one was initially following the others but made a turn west and disappeared behind the mountains.  We have an iPod video but it's not the best.   We shut off the engine to listen for jet noise or helicopter noise but there was nothing.  We're not sure anyone else witnessed it but it was very clear and started maybe a few  hundred feet in the air, the disappeared very high and north of us.;39.1004;-104.8548
