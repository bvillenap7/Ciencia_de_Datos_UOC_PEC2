Metallic silver like object in the cloudy sky;2010-07-13 09:24:00;No more than 1 second;Metallic silver like object in the cloudy sky July, 13, 2010.  My wife and I were travelling home from Hot Sulphur Springs, CO to Aurora, CO. While on US Highway 40, it was a cold and rainy day. We had past Winter Park, CO, when I began to take pictures because it was a beatuiful scenery of the cloudy mountain tops. This had happened for just a second.  Through my camera lens, Samsung SL620, I witnessed between mountains through the clouds a gigantic metallic silver building-like top and clicked the snap button.  I shouted to my wife, “Did you see that?!“   But she said “I am driving and watching the road.“  After that she asked me what had happened, but I thought that I had seen a hallucination because looking back at that spot there was nothing there. I left everything at that. But in my head left an uncertaintey of what was really there. My son put all the pictures into our computer.  Time by time i remembered that moment and looked at the photo. It had been more than a year past.  On the eve of my 47th birthday, I couldn‘t take it anymore so I zoomed in on the photograph on my computer screen.  I called over my wife and son and asked if either of them saw anything unusual on that picture.  They saw the same thing as me.  A huge object in the upper-left hand side of the picture.  So it seems to me that I have yet to go crazy.  We talked it over and decided to send this photo to you guys.  According to the picture it is easy to figure out at what portion of the US highway 40 the picture was taken. With regards.
