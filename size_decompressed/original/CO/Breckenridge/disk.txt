HUGE silent disk floats slowly in the Rocky Mountains;2002-08-12 12:30:00;3 minutes;HUGE silent disk floats slowly in the Rocky Mountains My girlfriend and I sat on the edge of a stream, just watching the water and listening to the trees. At the same time, we both looked up...in the middle of the afternoon, and were totally mezmerized by the sight of a HUGE disk floating silently above...in the midst of some light cloud cover. The disk was gray/sand in color and had no lights whatsoever. It was approximately 100 yards in diameter and floated slowly over us at an alitude of approximately 1500 feet. I cannot explain the fact that my girlfriend and I did not, or could not, talk about it for about two weeks after the event.

Disk with a portal.  ((NUFORC Note:  Anomalous objects in photo sent do not look to us as if either is a portal.  PD));2019-09-03 09:04:00;Pic;Disk with a portal I was with my friends in the mountains, they were hunting goat while I stayed lower elevation. I was watching the fish and taking pics.  When I reviewed my pics, I noticed two objects in the pic.  One was black disk shape and the other was a rectangular shape portal object.  I never heard or seen the objects with my eyes.  I couldnâ€™t tell if the disk was leaving or entering the portal. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be sincere.  Two anomalous objects in photo sent to our offices do not look to us as if either is a portal, in our opinion, although we have never seen a portal, to the best of our knowledge.
