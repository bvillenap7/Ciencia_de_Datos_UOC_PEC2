Moved in tandem, occaisionally thrusting. Strange, transluscent lights, objects moving slowly in tandem. Seemed to hover, then thrust. Thrust happened 3 times, I believe. The last thrust caused them to disappear. It was a clear day, bright blue sky. These things seemed so out of place that we first thought it had to be birds. Obviously, by their movement, it was not birds.;39.4844;-106.0192
Colored light falls to Earth, then reverses course through sky;2012-07-16 21:43:00;10 seconds;Colored light falls to Earth, then reverses course through sky At 9:43 pm, as I drove north on Airport Road in Breckenridge, CO, I saw a large light falling from NE to SW through the Northern sky.  The light fell predictably (as if it were a shooting star), but it changed colors from white to red to green.  After the light fell below tree line, it reversed its course and came back up into the sky before it fell back to Earth again (it was pink in color).  This reverse pattern is what leads me to believe it wasn't a meteor or comet.  I drove along airport road looking for people who may have been shooting fireworks, but there is a fire ban in Breckenridge and this light action was seen along the highway where shooting fireworks would be quite risky.  I couldn't find any people or any action of sorts.;39.4844;-106.0192
