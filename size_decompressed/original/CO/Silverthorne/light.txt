My husband and I were sitting in our living room.  We have a large wall of windows, and at 11:20 p.m. on Sunday, October 1, 2006, we saw about six lights coming from the south toward our house.  They were traveling northeast one behind the other in a straight line.  They looked like huge stars, whitish in color, smaller than what the moon looks like.  We ran out on our deck to watch them.  We watched for about 10 seconds.  They were close - between us and the mountain range on the other side of the highway.  We didn't hear anything.  One by one, from the furthest south, they each disappeared.  The first object, which was the last one left, was almost directly east of our house, near the mountain range, turned red, and disappeared.  At the time it disappeared, it was the size of a star.;39.74775;-106.1964
Strange lights in the sky while camping.;2015-07-31 09:50:00;8 hours;Strange lights in the sky while camping My brother and I went to my friend's family ranch in Grand County on William's Fork.  There were five of us, as well as my friends parents.  His parents went to bed, and the five of us sat around the campfire.  There were hardly any clouds in the sky as dusk fell.   At around 9:50, I spotted the lights of a plane in my left peripherals.  I'm a pilot and I like checking out all the planes and choppers in the sky.  As I watched it I found it strange that I couldn't hear any jet or propellor engine.  I pointed the plane out to my friend and he and another friend looked at it.  The plane had cruised from left to right and the moment after my two friends began watching it the plane lights dissolved and a split second later there were 5-6 greenish sparkling orbs of light flickering and sparkling interestingly.  They disappeared and my friends and I freaked out.  We went inside and didn't come out for a few hours, but when we did, there was a clear sky with a big bright full moon and lots of twinkling stars, as well as some strange lights hovering above the mountain ridges overlooking the ranch.  Throughout the rest of the night the lights continued, some would move, some just hover, some would illuminate in a new spot, some disappear and reappear, some would move blatantly across the sky, others would disguise themselves as the lights of a plane and then change later or just disappear.  The lights all stayed at a remarkably low altitude, hovering just above ridges or treetops.  We ended up staying awake until 6 am, when we went outside at 5.30 the light of day had chased all the stars from the sky.  However, two bluish orbs of light remained peeking out at us from behind a ridge.;39.74775;-106.1964
