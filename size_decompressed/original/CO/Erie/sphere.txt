Orange orb seen flying over Erie, Colorado headed NW.;2020-07-04 22:38:00;2 minutes;Orange orb seen flying over Erie, Colorado headed NW. A bright orange spherical light was seen moving from the southeast to the northwest like one would expect from a low altitude plane.  However, there was no noise heard and only a single light, no beacon.  I immediately started recording the object with my phone.  The light appeared to travel in the sky as a typical small aircraft would.  Approximately 2,000 feet in the air and moving in a straight line while maintaining altitude.  The object was lost to view in the clouds to the NW after approximately 2 minutes.;40.0622;-105.0653
