5-6 objects flying in v formation;2016-02-13 22:00:00;2-5 seconds;5-6 objects flying in v formation On a somewhat windy and foggy night, I saw what appeared to be 5 or 6 objects in a triangle formation out of a small side window of my house, towards the west I think.  I did a double take and really only caught a quick glimpse, but it was dark and foggy and it stood out very oddly to me.  My immediate thought was maybe Canadian geese migrating, as I've seen a lot of them lately, so I ran to the window as soon as I saw it to confirm, and it was already gone.  Whatever it was, it was moving way too fast to be geese, there was no sight of anything by the time I moved to check....there's no way birds could move that fast. It could have been military planes in flying V formation - that's my only guess.  The Erie Airport isn't very far from here...but it's usually only small private planes that fly into that airportâ€¦I don't know what I saw, but it was strange.;40.0622;-105.0653
4 triangular shaped craft in formation, no lights, no noise.;2016-08-21 21:40:00;3 minutes;4 triangular shaped craft in formation, no lights, no noise. Saw 4 triangle shaped craft coming in from NW.  No noise.  Seemed to be fairly low (maybe 500 ft. or less).  Flying in formation that changed, seemed to arrange vertically one on top of another.  Pale, with a faint pink/salmon color (my wife thought red).  No lights.  Turned slightly SE and flew off in that direction.   Waited about another 10 minutes, then gave up.  Too late and too fast for parachutes or hang-gliders.  No lights whatsoever so could not be commercial craft.;40.0622;-105.0653
