We were walking out of a local grocery store and were looking up at a beautiful rainbow.  To the south side and inside the rainbow were four somewhat triangular shaped objects. They were very bright and were stationary.  One of the objects traveled slowly down to hover above one of the other objects, but for the most part, they all stayed in one spot.  Three remained in a triangular formation and one of them remained above the rest of the group.  The objects faded away or were obscured by clouds and disappeared. Several customers and employees of the grocery store witnessed this occurance and there was much discussion as to how strange the sighting was.  Most of the witnesses noticed the very vivid rainbow prior to the appearance of the four objects.;39.7435;-105.0619
