Definitely not aircraft (Air Force veteran) but passenger aircraft lights where present in area, lights seemed to be higher than aircraft flight altitude but we do get a lot of air traffic coming and going from DIA over our area so canâ€™t be sure of altitude.  My first thought it was drones that has been in our state news recently but my opinion changed once the lights started to disappear to the west.  Rough degrees of travel was from 240 degrees traveling to 270 degrees roughly before fading out.  Flight path seemed to be the same for all, with roughly the same spacing in between and was just a continuous stream of them with aircraft traveling opposite direction but close to same flight altitude maybe a hair higher.  By time I returned to house to get the phone to get video the last few disappeared fading out! site all roughly in the same area around the 270degree mark.;40.8713;-105.378
