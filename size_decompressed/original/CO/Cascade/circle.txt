They appeared to maybe be comets but I cannot be sure. When they first came into view there were about 8-10 of them and they were orange and left trails or orange as well. After about 5 seconds they went behind a cloud and then 2 of them came out on the other side. They kept flying for about another 5 seconds until they were out of view. About 10 seconds after they were gone, I had not taken my eyes off of the sky, an airkplane came into view and flew behind the same cloud and then came out and left view. All of the objects were behind the cloud for approximately 5 seconds. I see many airplanes fly by my house, but have never seen any other flying objects. I am a strong believer in extra-terrestrials and immediately knew I would have to report what I saw.;38.8929;-104.9738
