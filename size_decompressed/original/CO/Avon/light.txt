Two solid white lights flying in formation over the Colorado Rockies;2006-07-13 11:00:00;1 minute;Two solid white lights flying in formation over the Colorado Rockies While looking at the stars, we saw two steady white lights flying in formation, traveling from north to south across the horizon.  They were travelling rather fast and at the exact same speed the entire time we saw them, one slightly below and behind the other.  The light went from similar to that of a star to very bright (resembling a spotlight) then gradually dimmer until we could no longer see them.  Almost as if the light was rotating very slowly.  When the light was brightest, it appeared to be vertically oblong in shape.  We waited to see if they appeared farther down the horizon, but they did not.  At the same time, airplanes were visible in other areas of the sky.  Since they looked nothing like the planes, we decided they must be UFOs.;39.6313;-106.5108
A very large bright light moving fromeast to west a a very high speed.;2009-07-22 21:30:00;30-40 seconds;A very large bright light moving fromeast to west a a very high speed. I was out walking my dog at about 9:30 at night.  I  live on top of a mountain at about  8,000 feet. I  looked up at the sky and saw a very large bright light moving at high speed from the east to the west.  There was no sound and no flashing lights.  It was not a plane.  I at first thought that it might be the space station.  However, I did some research on  the internet and the space station was not over Avon on that night.  There were also not any known satellites in the area.  It was also moving much too fast for the space station according to a friend who has watched it several times.  It was not a meteor and did not leave a trail. It moved horizontally and was extremely bright.  There have been many UFO sightings in our area recently.   I felt that it was important to add this one to your database.    I am also hoping that someone else saw this one.;39.6313;-106.5108
