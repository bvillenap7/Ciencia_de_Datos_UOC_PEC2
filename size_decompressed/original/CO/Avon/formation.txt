There were approximately 15 flashing red lights in a vertical formation.  They were seen headed NW, and then shifted to W.  The lights were flashing in sync, and appeared to have an effect of “falling” - as the lights Forbes farther in the distance over the mountain, the blinking appeared randomized.  When we first saw it, it looked like a cell phone tower, because off how straight the lights were after it was in the distance, it looked more like a grouping, in no particular order.;39.6313;-106.5108

There was no detectable sound.   Dogs in the neighborhood were barking loudly.  Usually one barks at a deer or two, but to hear many dogs barking at 9:15pm was odd.;39.6313;-106.5108
