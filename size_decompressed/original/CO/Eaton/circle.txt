UFO and pink orb.;2017-02-23 18:00:00;1-2 minutes;UFO and pink orb. On Feb. 23, 2017, at about 6:00 pm, I went out my back door and after the ice/snow storm the trees were gleaming in the sunset and It was beautiful and I wanted a photo.  I took 12 photos within seconds of each other trying to capture the sunset scene.  When I looked at the photos later I discovered one with a great pink orb with a bright light in the middle.  I also found 3 other photos with the bright light/orb and it was moving.  When I zoomed in best I can on my laptop, it appears that the bright orb is solid unlike the plasma orbs which you can see through.  I have had many sightings but this was the first photos.  I would love to know what you think and any additional information would be welcomed!  Thank you!;40.528;-104.7181
