White light grouping in north sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-10 20:30:00;5 minutes;White light grouping in north sky. While closing blinds in north window, noted a grouping of clear lights in sky above neighborâ€™s roofline.  The configuration was sort of plane-like, in that it appeared elongated.  Lights were numerous, not like those on an aircraft. They (lights) appeared small but could have been that object was further away than I thought.  It hovered in place for maybe 3 minutes then very slowly moved off to the southwest.  Tried to pick it up from a west window, but had lost track of it.  (? Drone ?).
