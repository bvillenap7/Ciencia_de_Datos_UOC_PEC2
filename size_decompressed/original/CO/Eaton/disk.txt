Large disk with light blue lights underneath.;2017-06-24 00:30:00;10 seconds;Large disk with light blue lights underneath. I saw a large disk hover silently about 200 feet or so above the ground with light blue lights on the underside.  It was much larger than a plane and a perfect circle shape.  It was a very clear night.  I have never seen a UFO before and it was very interesting.  I felt frozen.  However, as soon as I saw it and when I could no longer see it I could move again.  There was a dark haze around the disk.  My dogs didn't seem to notice anything.  I checked the clock after regaining movement ability and found that the time was an hour ahead, as the time when I went outside was 11:30 pm and the time after the sighting was 12:30 am.;40.528;-104.7181
