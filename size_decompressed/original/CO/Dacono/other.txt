Line of evenly spaced lights appearing at the same location then traveling through the sky and disappearing. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-03-05 19:45:00;5 minutes;A line of evenly spaced lights appearing at the same location then traveling through the sky and then disappearing From Dacono CO. looking West, I would estimate over Erie CO. a string of perfectly spaced lights about the size and shape of the stars in the sky were traveling from West Southwest to Northwest.  They appeared to be about 1/4 mile apart.  They appeared to be at the altitude and speed of jet airliners.  The lights would appear at the same location, travel through the sky for approximately 8-10 seconds each and then disappear at the same location.  There were approximatly 6 - 8 lights at a all times in the string.  I noticed this going on for about 5 minutes and then alerted a neighbor who witnessed the event for about 1 minute.  At that point there were about 4 lights in the string.  The entire time they were shining the same and moving the exact same speed.;40.0797;-104.9307
