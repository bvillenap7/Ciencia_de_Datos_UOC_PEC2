Other two witnesses focused on the area and saw a second bright flash directly west of the big dipper cup.  The flash was as bright as a camera flash.  Incredible.  It looked like it was traveling north. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));39.6341;-106.7588
MUFON/COLORADO REPORT:  Anomalous flashing strobe lights seen over Eagle CO;2009-05-07 21:30:00;10 Minutes;Anomalous flashing strobe lights seen over Eagle CO I am a MUFON investigator in Vail CO and recently we have had a number of UFO sightings in the area. I wanted to report through this site as the witness did not want to do a report with MUFON. The witness reported to me that on the evening of May 7th at about 9:30 PM she saw flashing strobe lights in the sky over Eagle that seemed to move about erratically. She said she had seen the lights over several nights and that they did not appear to be coming from any aircraft. There was no noise. There were two other sightings reported in Eagle County on the 7th. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Bob Fiske, of MUFON/Colorado, for sharing this report with NUFORC.
