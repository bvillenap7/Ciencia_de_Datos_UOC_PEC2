MUFON COLORADO REPORT:  Triangular craft seen in vicinity of Eagle County airport.;2005-10-09 20:30:00;Unknown;Triangular craft seen in vicinity of Eagle County airport. As a MUFON investigator I sometimes get reports second hand that I feel are good.  I was told this one within a few days after it happened.  A man who was visiting his daughter in the Eagle area spotted a lighted craft in the vicinty of the Eagle County Airport on the evening of Sunday October 9th.  There had been a storm passing through the area that night.  The craft appeared triangular in shape and was either hovering or moving slowly before ascending into the clouds.  Before I could interview him he returned to New Mexico and I hope to get his phone number soon so I can interview him and get more information.
