Used stargazing app to rule out planet or star. Observed a stationary, bright, orange-tinged light (as large as a bright star) in eastern sky. It was below and to the right/south of Orion. I observed for several minutes before remarking aloud that it had to be Mars. As I said so it faded and disappeared to black. After about 10 seconds it reappeared slightly higher and to the left/north of where it had been. Remained for about 30 seconds before fading to black again. There was a small cloud in the eastern sky but it was thin and I could still make out Orion in it this light was brighter than any around it. I could barely make out faint lights beneath it that appeared to be moving. Recorded with iPhone.;39.2087;-104.0702
