Two big bright spheres floating around over mountains;2012-11-08 19:15:00;10 minutes;Two big bright spheres floating around over mountains We were driving down the road when we saw two big bright orange colored spheres floating in the sky, probably about a half a mile over the mountains probably, much lower than the stars.   They would sit in place for about a minute maybe or less, then very slowly move up, down, left, and right.  They crossed paths at one point also.   They began to dull in a colar a tiny bit as we left.  There were absolutely no blinking lights like an aircraft, and they were about at least 4 times bigger than the stars we could see and much much brighter.;38.9585;-105.1987
