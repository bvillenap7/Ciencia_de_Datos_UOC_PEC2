Light in the sky that can stop moving, move in any direction, and has a ditinct light cycle.;2010-06-10 23:00:00;3 days;Light in the sky that can stop moving, move in any direction, and has a ditinct light cycle. I was with two buddys when i first saw it. we drove far back into peach valley, almost to black canyon and parked, we were all focused on one strange looking star that was much too big and bright to be a star, might have been a planet at that piont.  we then noticed a blinking blue light that was moving in a strange direction, swooping, doing circles in the air, and then it slowly moved to the east and was out of sight.  we then saw a glow on the horizon that was getting brighter very fast, it was a bright orange light in the sky coming directly toward us, the driver freaked out and started to drive away, the light did not move for awhile, then the light turned blinking red and blue,(but if you look closely you can see aring of lights) and may have been coming toward us but i cant say for sure, the light then turned blinking blue just like the light we saw before it.  The next day we went back to the same spot at about the same time and the same thing happened,! the light cycles were the same.  And then last night i was at my house in peach valley and i saw the same orange light that was not moving at all, i walked toward it and i could see it move from side to side, then it headed south and was blinking blue, this occured twice in one night.   I looked at the big star that in my mind still might be a planet, I watched it for about five minutes to see if it was moving, and i think it was but very slowly, i then went into my house, and when i came back out the big bright star that had been there for three days was gone.
