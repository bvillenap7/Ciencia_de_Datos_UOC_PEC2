On 12/10/2016, I sited 2 orange/pink spheres/fireballs, the were hovering and a slight motion left to right.  Seconds later another one appeared .  The third  one  appeared low on the horizon, than gained altitude to join the other two.  They made a triangle formation.   I went in the house got my husband out of bed and by the time we got back outside a fourth one had appeared and they made a diamond formation.  They hovered for a few seconds, than one by one at a high rate of speed moved west over Delta and disappeared into the clouds.  As the fourth one disappeared two more appeared at the original spot, hovering, than a third one appeared much closer to us,  The last one appeared to be within a forth of a  mile from us as it was a lot larger than the others, the three of them made a triangle formation and than again one by one moved west.  There was on sound.  This took about 6 to 7 minutes.  There was a cloud bank to the south of us, and t! hey appeared below the cloud band and in front of it.  They gained altitude, as they move West  over Delta they then flew into the cloud bank and disappeared.  Only the last one that appeared must have turned as it took a different shape, fireball in front and a slight arch and a smaller fireball at the end.  Temperature 37 degrees and no wind.  We live in the country and there is no road noise, so when there is noise it is easy to distinguish what it is.;38.7369;-108.0651
Fast fireball going straight down near Delta, Colorado.  ((anonymous report));2016-12-10 22:10:00;5 seconds;Fast fireball going straight down near Delta, Colorado. On the evening of December 10, 2016, my husband and I were driving toward Delta, Colorado, on Highway 50 at a little after 9:00 or so.  Through our windshield, we saw an AMAZING FIREBALL that was actually quite scary coming down in the farmland a little northwest of the town of Delta.  It appeared to be a meteor that was flaming down toward the land and seemed to extinguish just a couple of hundred feet before impact.   Once he concluded that is was not the missile he thought it was, my husband remarked that some farmer is going to find a really cool meteor in his field this spring. I am posting this a little late as we concluded this was just a larger meteor than most, however, others in Delta have been talking about seeing lights in he sky that preceded what we had observed around the same time.  I thought I would report what we saw to corroborate any other sightings that night in the area.  It was remarkably unusual.
