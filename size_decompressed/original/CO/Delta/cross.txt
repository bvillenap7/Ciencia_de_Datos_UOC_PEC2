Saw a green and red glowing cross in the sky;2007-03-31 21:48:00;30 min;Saw a green and red glowing cross in the sky At around 9:30 pm me and a friend of mine were observing what appered to be a very bright star. To our amazment it seemed to get brighter and brighter and closer to us, I was done I needed to know what it was so we came off the hill to my buddies house (he is the only one that I know that has a telescope).  Once I got it in a clear focus, it appered to be a cross shape with the main horizontal piece  a bright green while the vertical piece was a steady red strip.  Me and 3 of my friends identified it to be what we all agreed on!  At around 9:45 pm it started to get dimmer and fade out of the telescopes range, by 9:56 it was completey out of our view.......;38.7369;-108.0651
