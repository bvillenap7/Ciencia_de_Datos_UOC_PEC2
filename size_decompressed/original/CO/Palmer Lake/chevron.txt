Triangle shape moves across sky north of the US Airforce Academy;2011-10-16 21:45:00;13 Seconds;Triangle shape moves across sky north of the US Airforce Academy On Sunday Oct. 16th at aproximatley 9:45 P.M. I was standing outside my back deck smoking a cigarette when a small flash caught my eye.  When I looked I didn't see any flash but what I saw definately caught my eye.  It was the chevron shape just like I saw in reports of the Phoenix lights.  It had round orange lights on the bottom of the front and back two corners.  The lights were not bright enough and also far too large to be a normal aircraft lights.  I was able to pick out its actual shape as it flew by.  The most astonishing thing was how fast it was flying.  It took approximately 12-15 seconds to cover the horizon from south west to north east.  It did make noise but not like a jet engine.  I live in a big military area with an army base, an airforce base, and the airforce academy all within close proximity.  I see all sorts of aircraft flying around.  This was faster and and shaped different than anything I have ever seen.;39.1224;-104.9123
