I saw a sequence of lights that looked like stars moving through the sky from a single origin point to a single end point. They were all perfectly and evenly spaced and moving at the exact same speed. There were another plane flying at another point in the sky so I could distinguish between the plane and these other ufos. These objects moved from point a to point b for a duration of 2-3 minutes until the last one was gone. If these were planes and not ufos than it was a highly coordinated flight sequence between a huge squadron of planes to all be flying at the exact same speed in such a long linear fashion.;39.1224;-104.9123
