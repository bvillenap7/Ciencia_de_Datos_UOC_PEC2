Two extremely bright star-like lights that flashed vivid red and green.;2000-10-17 19:00:00;60 min, +;Two extremely bright star-like lights that flashed vivid red and green. These were two very bright lights distinguishable from surrounding stars by their exceptional vividness and clarity and the fact that they were flashing red and green.  One was on the east side of the valley and one was on the west side. The flashing red and green colors were clear to the naked eye. Icalled two couples and they viewed them too.  One couple are , both individuals, are ((profession deleted.  Individuals hold positions of responsibility.)).  One at ((deleted)), and the other at ((location deleted)).  Neither of them had ever seen anything like these flashing lights, and would love, by the way, anexplanation.  The other two people have been ((profession and tenure deleted both probably skilled at viewing the night sky))  years and they have never seen anything similar, either.  My ((age deleted)) year old son watched them with me as well.  I might add that te size of these lights was that of a huge star.                  as we viewed these the one on the east side of the valley moved. very slowly, south, not the direction one would expect from a fixed object like an actual star.  What are they and is there a history of similar sightings? ((NUFORC Note:  At request of witness, we have removed data from original report.  PD)) I have already submitted a description..I am concerned that I metioned that two of the witnesses wer ((deleted)).  Would it be possible to removethat fact from my submission this a.m.?  This is a very small town and I certainly don't want to cause tem any problems, at least not without their permission.  Thanks.;40.1279;-106.9074
