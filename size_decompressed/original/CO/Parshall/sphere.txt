White Orb Like object seen in digital photo;2004-03-13 14:00:00;Photo;White Orb Like object seen in digital photo I was going through some photos from a spring break trip that took place in early March and noticed a odd spherical white orb in the digital far off in the distance subsequent photos did not have any such object so i know it wasnt something on the camera lense. I have another photo from the trip of a strange looking object taken within the same series of photos on the drive between Steamboat Springs Colorado and Denver I-70.;39.9539;-106.093
