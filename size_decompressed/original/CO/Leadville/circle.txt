Massive near Leadville, CO.   A bright orange/amber orb appeared from the southwest, traveling towards the northeast.  Was traveling faster than an airplane (we saw several planes passing overhead), but not as fast as a meteor.   A distinct vapor trail was visible behind the craft, as reflected by the moonlight.  I would estimate the altitude to be between 15,000 to 18,000 ft above sea level.   As an airline pilot, it was something unique that I was unable to explain.  The orb disappeared behind Mt. Massive.;39.2458;-106.3003
