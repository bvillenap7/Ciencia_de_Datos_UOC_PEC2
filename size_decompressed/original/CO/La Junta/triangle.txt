perfect triangular objects flying in perfect form with incredible speeds.;2001-06-23 23:15:00;5 seconds;perfect triangular objects flying in perfect form with incredible speeds. Lat night was very clear, My wife and I were visiting with freinds, as we spoke I was watching the sky, as I usually do.  When I noticed that directly above us was the most amazing sight for me. the shape was that of a perfect triangular form, with each tip of the triangle light with a dim light and pointing the same direction, I beleive that between the three light triangle there was something in the middle, like if it were just one craft.  The craft was traveling east at an astounding speed.  From the time it was over the top of us to the time it disappeared into the horizon was just few seconds, but I felt as I has watched it for longer.  The object  blended with its stary background so well, I just could not beleive how it mixed in with its surroundings so well,  My estimates of the distance  off the ground would have been about 300 feet.  totally quiet, There was not a sound to be heard and the speed was like no other.  Out of the three of us, I was the only one who saw. the speed of the object was so great that by the time I told them to look it was gone by the time they looked.  I was just lucky to not have taken my eyes off of it.  amazing. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD));37.9546;-103.6644
