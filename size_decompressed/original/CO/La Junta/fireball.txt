Flying object shoot out in the sky.;2016-02-11 03:45:00;30 minutes;Flying object shoot out in the sky. I went to let my dog out, and when I looked up I saw what looked like falling stars or meteors.  When they finished entering our atmosphere, they seemed to separate, slow down and stop moving (just hover).   After around 30 seconds they appeared to start firing at each other.  I even saw them blowing up.  After around 25 minutes of watching this display, I figured that I had freaked myself out enough and went back to bed.   Later that day I saw nothing on the news or internet about it.  I thought I was going crazy, until I saw someone from FL posted a video of the exact same thing I had seen (only without the shooting).   Is there anyone else that saw this kind of show or behavior?
