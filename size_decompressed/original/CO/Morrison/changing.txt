I was hiking in the foothills of Morrison, Colorado, when I saw three lights in the southeast sky hovering over the city of Denver.  I ran to my truck, grabbed my camera, and by the time I started filming, only two lights remained:  they were amber-colored, they glowed unlike commercial aircraft, and they stayed still. Then, one of them began to move:  it split into two, raced across the sky underneath the other one, and then transformed into three objects.  It went behind a hill and I lost sight of it.  The whole event lasted about 20-25 minutes  Please see the video here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9qRnuqm7jA;39.6131;-105.1757
