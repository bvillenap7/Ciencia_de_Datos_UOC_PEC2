Saw a stream of lights going from north west to southwest.  ((Starlink satellites??));2021-02-11 05:45:00;7-8 minutes;Saw a stream of lights going from north west to southwest. They were not evenly spaced but moved at at a pretty fast pace. Probably 3 to 4 times faster than satellites Iâ€™ve seen in the past. They where in a perfect line a stretched across at least half the sky. I had problems with my phone camera video but did manage to get a couple photos and a short video.;39.6131;-105.1757
