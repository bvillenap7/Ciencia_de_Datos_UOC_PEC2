Flashing light of different brightness and duration moving high in the sky to the south very slowly.;2017-08-27 20:42:00;5 minutes;Flashing light of different brightness and duration moving high in the sky to the south very slowly. I went outside to grab something from the truck and as I looked up I noticed a bright flash of light.  A few seconds later there was another flash and after that there were slower flashes of light coming from the object.  These slower flashes were varied in their brightness.  During this time the object was moving very slowly across the sky to the south.   It seemed very high in the sky but was not like any satellite that I had seen before, it moved slowly, and when it wasn't flashing the bright light it was non visible.  At that point I went and got my girlfriend who is more skeptical that I so that she could see it also.  From the time I saw it until it passed behind the clouds was around 5 minutes.;39.6131;-105.1757
