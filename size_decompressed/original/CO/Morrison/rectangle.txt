Wife and I laying in bed looking out the sliding glass door, facing east, just after a thunder storm. We both saw a black rectangle appear high in the sky for about 1.5 seconds or less. No apparent mothion.  We immediately told each other what we saw, and out descriptions matched. Appeared to be a few hundred yards wide, and about 1/3 as tall as it's width. It was completely black with no detail. It was as if a door into blackness temporarily opened and closed. There were clouds behind it, but nothing showed through it. Direction or view: East by Southeast. Angle of Elevation from viewer: 25 degrees. Apparent Distance: 2 to 4 miles. A two-dimentional black rectangle, long edge parallel to the ground, apparently facing (flat face of it) due west. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.6131;-105.1757
