Fuzzy black box hovering mid day on winter solstice at Red Rocks caught on video.;2006-12-21 12:00:00;3-5 min;Fuzzy black box hovering mid day on winter solstice at Red Rocks caught on video. I find it odd that this sighting has not been reported here before. I was looking for the video footage I saw on Fox News Denver when I found this site. Fox News in Denver showed the video sometime in April 2 weeks after I saw a similar object near Loveland, CO. The video was taken by an amateur on winter solstice at Red Rocks Park, Morrison, CO. I remember it was a fuzzy hovering black box. Has this video been proven to be a hoax?  Or is it legit and being suppressed?  I remember this date because I was at Red Rocks drumming up the sun that brisk winter solstice morning.  I did not see the object there that day but someone recorded video of it.
