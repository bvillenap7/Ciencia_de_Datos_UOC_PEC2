Observed a glowing spherically shaped object approximately 1/2 mile North of my position moving from west to east.  As the object passed due North of our viewpoint, it bob up and then down, penetrated a small cloud and disappeared momentarily.  It reappeared still heading east, then went dark for approximately one second, then standard aircraft lighting became visible.  The object then began making noise consistent with a single-engine propeller driven aircraft.  Prior to the lighting configuration change, the object had been silent.  The object then continued on an eastward heading.;40.3185;-104.7261
