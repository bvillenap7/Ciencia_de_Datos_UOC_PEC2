Two strobe like lights flying in unison in southern sky over Victor, CO;2012-01-26 19:00:00;15 minutes;Two strobe like lights flying in unison in southern sky over Victor, CO While driving between Cripple Creek and Victor, saw two strobe-like white lights flying in unison in erratic circles and patterns, headed from the northwest to the southeast.  Parked in Victor and watched for several minutes while they flew back and forth in the southern sky.  Came close enough to see there were two craft but could not identify as a plane or helicopter.  No distinguishable sound, but did hear other planes in the area.  Only one white light on each craft, no other lights and each blinked erratically, sometimes in unison.  We see planes and helicopters, even military all the time in this area and these were not even comparable.;38.7091;-105.1369
