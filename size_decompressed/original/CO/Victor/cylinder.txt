colored lights behind Pike's Peak;2000-09-24 20:15:00;4 or 5 minutes;colored lights behind Pike's Peak My husband and I were heading home from work on a dark country road and noticed a very large strange object hovering next to the west side of Pike's Peak.  It appeared to be oval with colored lights and either pulsing or rotating in position.  We ruled out helecopters and planes.  It definately wasn't a house or vehicle as there are no houses or roads in that area.  We turned off our lights to watch it for a couple of minutes.  After a couple of minutes, I turned on my parking lights in case someone happened to drive up on us and the object suddenly emitted a very bright white spot light and started moving in what looked like our direction - I turned the lights off very quickly and the object returned to it's original colors and stopped moving.  I asked my husband if we had the vidio camera with us and he said yes.  However, When hereached for it, the object disappeared in slow motion from the outside in.  Very strange.....;38.7091;-105.1369
