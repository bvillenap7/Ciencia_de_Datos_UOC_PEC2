vertical formation of stars connected by a straight, bright white light.;2020-04-25 21:45:00;30 seconds;vertical formation of stars connected by a straight, bright white light. Looking northwest into the night sky. A vertical formation of over 10 stars appeared gradually over the course of a few seconds. The stars were connected by a vertical, straight, bright, white light. The vertical line of stars remained stationary and were always connected by the line of light. The stars were twinkling in the night sky for about 20 or so seconds before they began to fade until eventually they were gone.  It looked as if someone had drawn a straight vertical line between formation of stars. I  have reviewed photos of starlink, but they do not match what I saw that night.;39.1009;-104.5729
