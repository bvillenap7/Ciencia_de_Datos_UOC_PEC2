String of 5 Total Lights That Slowly Moved In A Span Of About 15 Minutes;2016-03-20 05:30:00;10 minutes;String of 5 Total Lights That Slowly Moved In A Span Of About 15 Minutes I woke in the middle of the night on a camping trip, looked out my tent and originally saw a line of three bright white lights.  After looking at it for about 5 minutes, I tried to turn on my iPad to see if I could snag a video of it.  Around that time, two very dim lights appeared on each side of the UFO.  I tried to take a video of the flying object, but couldn't see anything.  It began slowly moving away after about 5 minutes.  The lights slowly got closer together as it disappeared behind a tree, although I could still see the light of it behind the tree for a couple more minutes.  It disappeared soon after and I went back to sleep.;39.1009;-104.5729
