close encounter;2007-08-18 00:45:00;10 seconds;close encounter I'm a science teacher and do not normally believe in the paranormal.  I was coming back with my wife from dropping off the moving truck.  There were no cars on the roads. We were passing a 1 mile stretch of farmland.   We drove over a small hill and a flying saucer was hovering over the road.  It made no noise and had a metallic shine it looked like the classic UFO.   We were only about 80 feet away and getting closer.  It must have been 20 to 30 feet across.   The UFO made an aggressive move towards the moving car.  I thought it was going to hit us.  I panicked and did not stop.   My wife looked back and it was nowhere in sight.  We do not know if we lost time.  I think we did not.  We are not sure to this day.   It took me a while to report this since I'm into astronomy and a skeptic.;39.8284264150944;-104.910677358491
