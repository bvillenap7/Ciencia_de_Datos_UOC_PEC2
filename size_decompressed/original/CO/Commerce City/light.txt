Three star like objects seen in broad daylight on two seperate days;2000-07-10 12:15:00;30 minutes;Three star like objects seen in broad daylight on two seperate days I was sitting underneath a tree at lunch today and saw a strange object.  It was nearly straight up, moving VERY slow to the north.  It looked like a star.  It kept its course going north, I figured it must be at 30,000-40,000 feet.  About as large as one wing of a commercial jet flying at 35,000.  I watched it for about 10 minutes in which it had traveled to about 45 degrees above north horizon.  Then it got close to a cloud and changed course to the WNW.  I was able to follow it for about 3 more minutes before it was to far away to see.  Broken clouds where at I would guess 10,000 feet and moving to east.  There was some cotton seeds blowing in wind at I would guess 100 feet, they where moving north also.  Then about 10 minutes later I saw another one!  This one appeared slightly to the northeast of direct above.  It was moving slightly faster and to the west.  There where more clouds and when it went behind one it actually was in front of it.  The strange thing is it went from a star light like object to dark, it showed up against the white cloud!  When it came out from in front of cloud it was still white/star like.  It changed course after about 1 minute and started moving NNW.  I watched it pass in front of some more clouds and lost sight of it as it got to far away.  I do not think it could be a balloon because it was at a lesser altitude than the clouds yet they where moving in different directions.  I'll never know what it was, but it was not a airplane or helicopter.  It was like a light than just a white object.  Must not have been to large since it was at a lower altitude than I first thought it was. You won't believe it but I saw it again on Tuesday.  I noticed it almost straight up slightly to the east.  Did not move for a couple of minutes.  Then started to drift SLOWLY to south.  Then started to move slowly north.  Meandered to east.  At this time it faded but was still visible.  It brightened back to original intensity.  Then picked up some speed, although still very slow, began moving NNW.  Then WNW.  Followed it to around 30 degrees above horizon.  I had to ask myself if I was imagining it.  This time I tried to keep my head still to see what kind of movement I could detect.  It seemed, although I can't be for sure, that it would meander back forth to and fro.  It is bright enough that if you pointed it out to someone they would be able to see it easily.  I have no explanation.  There where no clouds.  Still saw cotton seeds at lower altitudes.  Does anyone know if they gather into huge balls?  I have seen small clumps like 10 joined together but they are not in a perfect sphere.  This is Wednesday and I did not see it today.  I am going to bring binoculars tomorrow just in case.  I followed it this time for 20+ minutes.  Do not remember which direction wind was blowing.;39.8284264150944;-104.910677358491
White light changes direction and zooms into space;2011-08-08 04:50:00;1 min;white light changes direction and zooms into space My wife and i we're going for a run. wile waiting on her i saw a brigt star that dimmed. When she came out I pointed the now dem star to her.  At this point we bouth could see it moving slowly higher north and east.Much lie a satelite moves. Then it changed directions and excelerated very very quickely to the west.Inless then two seconds it was a third of the way across the sky and apeared to vanish into space;39.8284264150944;-104.910677358491
Dancing stars in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect twinkling stars, but cannot be certain.  PD));2015-08-20 23:00:00;All night;Dancing stars in the sky. There are what looks like stars in the sky, but they move and dance around great distances.  It is not temperature caused atmospheric wave distortions.  These stars actually move about sometimes rapidly, sometimes a hand width at arm's length, sometimes not very far.  It is hard to judge because they are way up there and we are down here on the ground.   I have not heard any one else mention this phenomenon.  Not on Coast to Coast nor any other place.   Surely I am not the only person on earth to have noticed this strange happening. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect twinkling stars, but cannot be certain.  PD));39.8284264150944;-104.910677358491
