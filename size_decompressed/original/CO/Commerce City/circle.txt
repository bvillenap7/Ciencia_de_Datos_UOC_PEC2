White dot in daylight sky cloaks, reappears, and travels to to numerous locations before scooting away and out of sight.;2012-03-15 11:00:00;15 minutes;A white dot in the daylight sky sky cloaks, reappears, and travels to to numerous locations before scooting away and out of sight. While laying in a field looking at clouds with my now ex-wife, we noticed a white dot in the sky.  The distance was similar to that of a jet flying over at 35-40k feet.  We noticed the dot was 100% stationary and started wondering if it was a satellite, etc.   After a few minutes, the dot vanished, almost as if it were being covered by some kind of dome that, as crazy as it sounds, felt like a cloaking device.  You could see it vanish from top to bottom and then, nothing but sky. As strange as we thought that was, we went back to looking at clouds.  A few minutes later off to our left, there it was again moving back overheard from our left, the west.  The white dot moved to several different locations, stopping, changing directions, etc.  It did this for several minutes before finally moving at a fairly high rate of speed to the northwest, where it disappeared in the distance.
