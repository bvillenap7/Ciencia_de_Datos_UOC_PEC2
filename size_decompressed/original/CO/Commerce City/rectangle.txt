Large rectangular aircraft hovering west of Commerce City, CO;2015-10-28 11:22:00;1 minute;Large rectangular aircraft hovering west of Commerce City, CO Saw large aircraft hovering in sky between Commerce City, CO, and the Rocky Mountains.  Craft shaped rectangular like a bus, but much, much larger.  Had strange shadowing/aura around it.  Clearly was not an airplane.  Could have been a huge helicopter or blimp, but heard no sound nor saw chopper blades.  Aircraft traveled northeast away from me and was gone out of sight within one minute.  Seemed too fast to be a blimp.  Presidential debate in Boulder today.  Possible military craft, but did not look anything like the military blimp, recently in the news, flown over PA.;39.8284264150944;-104.910677358491
