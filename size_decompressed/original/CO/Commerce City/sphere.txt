Large number of high altitude white spheres in sky over Commerce City, CO, in 1997;1997-03-01 12:30:00;a few hours;Large number of high altitude white spheres in sky over Commerce City, CO, in 1997 This is from when I was in fourth grade. I was eating my lunch in the cafeteria of Central Elementary School, when another student ran in and said There are things in the sky!  Come look!   I got excited, downed my lunch quickly, and went outside to the playground.  By the baseball field nearest the school, there were several other children standing and looking at the sky, and I looked at the sky and saw many, many small white spheres quite high in the sky.  They didn't seem to be moving, and I told the other kids they were weather balloons, but I wasn't really sure of what they were myself. They did not appear to be in any sort of formation, there were just a large number of white spheres widely spread out over the western sky.  If I had to guess, I'd say that there were around 50 spheres, but I'm not sure.   In the afternoon, the teacher gave us a short recess, and there were still white spheres in the sky, though there were fewer of them, I'd say <10, all seemed stationary.   After we were released from school, I could only see two of them.   When my parents came home a few hours later, I wanted to show them what I had seen in the sky, but when I went outside to look for them, there were none to be seen.
