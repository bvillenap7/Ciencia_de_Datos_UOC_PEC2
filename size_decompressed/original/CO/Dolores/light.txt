Red light traveling north to south the reversed direction;2011-09-25 20:22:00;4 minutes;Red light traveling north to south the reversed direction On 09/25/11 at 2022, I observed a red non blinking light travel from the south towards the north.  The light appeared about the area of the Constellation Triangulum traveling towards Cassiopeia.  As the red light reached the Constellation Cassiopeia, it faded away and reappeared on the north side of Cassiopeia eastern stars.   After the red light reappeared again it, traveled North a short distance before it disappeared again.   I started searching the area where I had last seen the red light when it reappeared traveling to the south retracing its prior flight path.  The red light crossed directly over the second star to the bottom of Cassiopeia blocking out the light of the star.  The red light continued traveling south until it disappeared again, this time to the south of the Constellation Triangulum at 2026 the event lasted for approximately 4 minutes.;37.4666;-108.4717
Bright yellowish orange object moving south to east.;2014-06-28 22:27:00;2-3 minutes;Bright yellowish orange object moving south to east. On 06-28-2014 at approximately 2227 hours, I observed a bright yellowish to orange light moving from the south next to the constellation Scorpio.  I noticed the object moved from the south, and then slowly curve to the northeast.   The objects motion was not a consistent smooth motion, it appeared to hesitate at times giving it a slight jerky motion.   Once the object neared the east, the color became a deeper orange.   I observed the object for about two to three minutes until I could no longer observe it.  The brightness of the object was twice the brightness of a commercial airliner.  Due to the brightness of the object, I wondered if it was the International Space Station.   I did look at isstracker.com and saw that at 2227 hours the Station would have been over the southern tip of South America.;37.4666;-108.4717
Facing Sleeping Ute Mtin. toward ?Venus a stream of around 20 slow and steady moving, evenly spaced objects. ((Starlink satellites));2020-02-07 20:00:00;~10 minutes;Facing Sleeping Ute Mountain looking toward ?Venus a stream of around 20 slow and steady moving, evenly spaced objects moved in what appeared to be a gentle arc originating just left of ?Venus.. Each appeared at full brightness and as the line continued to my right they each disappeared at full brightness at the same spot. Guessing I would say the event lasted 10 minutes.   I like watching for satellites and would think that is,what they were...but high flying aircraft maybe? Totally silent.;37.4666;-108.4717
Observed a point of light move and stop in the evening sky.;2020-11-13 17:00:00;40 min;Observed a point of light move and stop in the evening sky. At about sunset (17:00) very low on the northern horizon I saw what I first believed to be a bright star or planet. It was the only star visible in the evening sky at this time. I watched it for a few seconds before realizing it was moving east just slightly.  I asked my wife to come out and see it. I told her  hey you see that star there, keep and eye on it for me will ya? I went inside to find binoculars. By the time I had come back out ( a few minutes later) my wife had witnessed the object move slowly and evenly a great deal eastward, before it came to a complete stop.  When viewed through the binoculars the object appeared to be a single dot of white light. We had time to set up a telescope on the now stationary object and through this the object appeared to be scintillating with all colors but was still a very small and indistinguishable dot of light with no features.  I shot the object with a compass and shot where I had originally observed it. The object had moved from almost due north to 44 degrees and at an angle of approximately 15 degrees. The time was noted as 17:44.  We continued to observe the object periodically through the evening and it appeared to melt into the rest of the night sky and rose with the rest of the night objects around it. At about 20:00 a haze moved in and the object was no longer distinguishable from other heavenly bodies.;37.4666;-108.4717
