Two objects seen (daytime) over Arvada Colorado;2008-06-24 09:10:00;10 min;Two objects seen (daytime) over Arvada Colorado Looking west two object were seen. One large one small.  The larger object was square brown and mostly transparent with spots.   Although the larger object was square it had the characteristics of an amebae organism.  The second object was much smaller and very close buy the larger object.  The second object appeared to be of a very shinny silver material but extremely thin. The second object was floating horizontal.  The object was first spotted in the western sky by the first person.  Person # 1 called a coworker over and both saw the larger transparent object but the coworker could not see the thin second object.  The objects were stationary and the wind made the larger object wave like a flag because the object was flat.  There were NO aircraft around what-so-ever.  The thin silver object seemed to be pulling or holding the larger object.  A large very dark shadow moved over the building and when the witnesses looked back to wear the object they were both gone.  No clouds and a very windy day.  The event left a 'feeling' or impression with one of the witnesses that there was something wrong the event.  Something wasn't right.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
bright orb seen flying over arvada, colorado;2011-01-24 06:12:00;10 minutes;bright orb seen flying over arvada, colorado This object came out of the north/northwest.  It was a circular ball of light that I thought at first might be an aircraft landing light.  It was as bright as an aircraft light,very bright.  However there was no flashing lights of any kind.  I did have binoculars, but could only make out a bright orb.  It moved directly over me as it was performing a wide arcing turn. It eventually was headed toward the east/northeast and I watched it until it disappeared.  The total event lasted around 10 minutes time.  It made no sound whatsoever and never varied its speed or altitude.  It never lost brightness only dimmed as it receded into the distance.  Its altitude didn't seem as high up as a commercial jet, but I couldn't be sure because of nothing to compare it to.
