3 large blue spherical objects spotted in Arvada, Colorado in late 1986;1986-11-03 20:30:00;less than 1 minute;3 large blue spherical objects spotted in Arvada, Colorado in late 1986 The date and time are more of a guess at this point given that the event occured at least 2 decades ago.  Reading some of the recent events reminded me of it.   I was walking down the street and off to the west, toward the mountains I saw the large glowing blue spherical objects arc across the sky and then vanish.  They flew in-line with one another, like a traffic light, just straight up and down.  They just appeared, and followed, almost like a rainbow pattern and then vanished.   The lights remained solid the entire time, they did not flicker and they did not make any sound.  I would approximate the distance to have been at a minimum of 3 miles away, and still they were very large.  A few moments later, another individual came out of her house and said she saw them as well.  After about 20 minutes of continued observation of the location the objects were spotted, they did not reappear.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
Watched 4 orbs of light traveling in unison then rotated around each other.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect advertising lights.

I was driving, so I couldn't get video.  Tried to follow, but lost them. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect advertising lights, although the witness believed that not to be the case.
