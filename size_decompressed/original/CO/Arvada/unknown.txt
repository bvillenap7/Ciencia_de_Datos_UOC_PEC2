Extremely fast moving silent white orbs in formation over Arvada going SW turning SSW. 9:50 pm 12/31/16;2016-12-31 09:50:00;3 seconds;Extremely fast moving silent white orbs in formation over Arvada going SW turning SSW. 9:50 pm 12/31/16 I saw a group of what looked like white orbs traveling extremely fast going SW and making a turn in formation to SSW at 9:50 pm over Arvada Colorado.  I have also seen a translucent shapeshifting boomerang craft fly over 13 times and have documented it within my own records.  This also could have been the translucent shape-shifting craft flying lower, but it looked different.  They could have been separate.  These things or thing was traveling faster than a fighter with no sound. 9:50 could be a possible route time as I have been witnessing the craft around this time after the time change.  Before the time change it was around 8:50 now 9:50?  Hmmmm flight pattern detected.....;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
