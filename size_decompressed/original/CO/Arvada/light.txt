Two stars in the sky, moving and then dissappearing;1977-06-19 22:05:00;20 seconds;Two stars in the sky, moving and then dissappearing I looked in the southwest sky and saw two stars and almost immediately realized they were moving away from me. I checked their movement by looking at the other stars to make sure they weren't moving too. I watched the moving stars again and subsequently, they just faded away. There were at least three earthly crafts in the general viscinity as well.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
Report to COMUFON: James Peters, 303-344-5576. Two observers. Very fast moving lights. Changes in direction and velocity.;1999-06-13 20:00:00;20 minutes;Report to COMUFON: ((name deleted)), 303-(telephone # deleted)). Two observers. Very fast moving lights. Changes in direction and velocity. At 20:00 hours, Observer1 notices a bright object from his back porch that is almost directly overhead.  Observer1 is sure of the time because he could hear a popular television program starting inside.  He was facing towards the south and the object was aproximately 80 degrees above the horizon, almost directly above his position.  The object catches his attention because of its brightness and that it seems to be moving around.  The object is not confused with normal air traffic, which was present at that time, planets or a satellite because of its intensity.  Observer1 calls his friend out to witness the object.  Observer2, who was a sniper in the Army, easily sees the object and three other objects in near proximity to it.  Observer1 goes inside to get his binoculars: West German, Steiner, Commander Pilot S, 7X50mm with a built in compass. With binoculars, Observer1 is able to see the other 3 objects noticed by observer2.  Observer1 is not able to make out some substance and colors to main object.  Main object begins to move rapidly to the south after loitering around with 3 smaller lights.  Observer1 tracks main object to the south while observer2 follows 3 smaller or less intense lights.  Observer1 watches the main, brightest object disappear beyond the horizon at a heading of 136 degrees in a time span estimated to be 5-8 seconds.  Observer2 sees other 3 objects depart straight up or radially from the Earth.  Observer1 not able to reaquire the 3 smaller lights and observer2 is able to see the 3 smaller lights longer than observer1.  Note: terms smaller and larger deal with the intesity of the lights and not necessarily to their true size.  The terms were used by the observer1 to report the event to this investigator.  The altitude of the objects seemed much higher than surrounding aircraft traffic.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294

What looked like a simple satellite, changed color, became more bright and expanded in 3-4 times in size.;2009-08-29 21:50:00;3 minutes;What looked like a simple satellite, changed color, became more bright and expanded in 3-4 times in size. Watching what I thought to be a satellite.  A small dim light, very high in the atmosphere moving steadily across the sky as I've witnessed other satellites do.  The light changed color to a vivid blue then brightened and expanded to at least 3-4 times the original size, all while moving at the same steady speed.  This lasted for about 10 seconds, then the light both dimmed and went back to it's original color.  I watched it for a few moments more, then it simply winked out.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294

Orange orb up in Lookout Mountain in Golden.;2014-11-28 19:50:00;20 minutes;Orange orb up in Lookout Mountain in Golden. My mother and I were on our daily drive to go visit my grandma, at the Arvada Cemetery.    As we were paying a visit to wish grandma a Happy Thanksgiving, we happen to notice a light that was not a regular part of the hillside.  It was seeming to float above the towers up on Lookout Mt. in Golden.   We watched the light,which was a orange amber colored oval shape light, dancing above the towers.  It moved and got lower to the horizon and shifted to the right.  And began to station itself above the third tower.   This was not the only thing this orb did, it grew and shrank in size, and would turn off like a light.  And reappear again.  It would vanish and reappear in the same spot.  After viewing it 20 minutes, it was gone! Like it just vanished in thin air!  I also went home, and got on the bike to see if I could investigate further.  I brought my highest viewing binos with me.  And to no avail, was not able to find the light that was over the towers on Lookout Mt.   I am trained and UFO investigator, since 2000.  I have many hours of field work.  And keep logs of what I see each year, and yearly on since today!  I have been seeing lots of these orange orbs here CO, and they seem to be apart of the night skies year after year!  But this orb was special to have seen.  It was the longest I have seen stay in one spot and disappear in thin air!   The temp outside was a 55 degrees and the moon was above the mountain as well.  Also, there was a few air traffic that flew above the orb, and that was when it turned off and then came back again after the plane had passed.  Which was very interesting to witness.  My mom and I were so amazed, we knew it was not something of our known knowledge.  So, we both said, UFO!  Couldn't identify it, and therefore was unknown to us.  Keep on looking Coloradans..  The skies keep getting more interesting over the years here!  Nights are fun to catch these orbs up in the foothills here in the Metro area.  Keep your eyes to the skies!;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
Amber Light Changes Solid Red.;2014-12-08 22:01:00;10 minutes;Amber Light Changes Solid Red Just went outside to bring the trash out in my neighborhood.  Happen to notice a amber gold light that was heading south towards Lakewood.  The light was right over my house here in town, and flew overhead above me.  This was not a commercial type plane or such.  As I watched the light/object continue on a southern heading, it began to take on another color.  It changed into a solid Red Ball!, about the size of  dime in distance!  The light now was a round ball of solid red light.  Not only did it change color, it was moving slower and began pulsating on and off!   I remember back in 2000 when my parents and I went down to visit the then first of it's kind here CO, The UFO Watchtower in the Valley!  That was the first time my father and I had seen such light of this nature!  It was just like the one we had seen down in Hooper in 2000.This Red Ball of light is always haunting to see! I always see this type of UFO here in CO.  Whatever it is,it is not ours.  And it is intelligent.  Tonight was not the first time I have seen the Red Ball of light.  During the earlier part of this year in Feb,I had witnessed several Red Balls of light.  In Feb., the lights were in a Triangle formation here in Arvada.  Heading West toward Golden.  I had made my report and contacted this site about it.I am just amazed how I can be in the right place at the right time to catch a good view of these lights.  Lucky I am.  I also have been reading Messages by Stan Romanek!  And he too, has seen lights just like the ones I see.  I guess this makes me wonder, what the heck are these lights doing?  And why here in CO period!!  Not sure!  But can say this,whatever they are,they move like nothing we have!  And disappear just as they appear as fast as they do!  I know I will keep looking up and keep on reporting to better help all other investigators in getting to the bottom of what these lights are.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
Orange orb-like lights seen.;2019-07-10 20:50:00;15 minutes;Orange Orb like lights seen. On my way home from fishing, stopped at Stinger Field for a quick break to view the mountains.  Looking westwards,noticed multiple orange/yellow looking lights high up on the mountain range.  Lights were fading in and out!  Sometimes two appear at once, and then one again by itself!  These lights have been seen by me, almost every night when I come back from fishing.  During the winter time, the same lights can be seen as well.  The lights seem to be intelligent and controlled!  The lights reminds me of the orange orbs I used to see in Hooper and Center, in the San Luis Valley for many years now.  I will continue to report this summer and year of these orange lights seen here in Arvada and the Metro Area!  If any one else sees what I am seeing, I encourage you to give your details and report it here too! I am certain there are others out here who are seeing the same!  Also, last night on July 9th 2019 at the same time, the lights were seen along with a meteor!  It was a bright white fireball streak that broke up over the mountains where the lights were!;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
