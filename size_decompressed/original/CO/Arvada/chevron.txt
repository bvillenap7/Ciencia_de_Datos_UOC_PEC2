Object was seen in the eastern sky east of Wadsworth, in Arvada, CO.  I thought it looked like someone was flying a kite.  It was hovering like a kite, but not in a place you would usually noticed a kite, like where there are trees and houses.  My husband said that no, that is not a kite.   The object pointed itself southward and then due west across Wadsworth Blvd and headed west towards the mountains.  We were in the car and were unable to track it from that point.  We got a decent look at it.  It was boomerang shaped, metallic and glistening. It seemed to be at a low altitude, small plane in size.
