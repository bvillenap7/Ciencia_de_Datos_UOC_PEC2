Daylight disc , Jeffco Colorado , 2001;2001-11-10 15:00:00;30 seconds or so;Daylight disc , Jeffco Colorado , 2001 In the fall of 2001 , my elderly father and I were attending a high-school football playoff game on a bright late-fall Sunday afternoon at the beautiful North Jeffco stadium , nestled right against the foothills of the Colorado front range . At one point , a jet roared overhead , and many spectators immediately looked up ( a not-unusual reaction immediately following the 9/11 debacle ! ) and saw a 757 heading west at about 5000 ft. altitude . Everyone looked back down to the action on the field...and my father goes  What the hell is THAT ?  . I looked back up , and on a south to north heading , at a hieght of no more than a thousand or so feet , a small , oval or egg shaped , brightly reflecting silver object was zipping at a good clip , disappearing to the north in a matter of less than half a minute . My Dad was in WWII , well versed in estimating distance , speed , and aircraft identification , and I have been an aircraft watcher and fan for over 35 years.......and niether of us have ever seen anything to compare with the high speed or odd shape of this problematical object .

During 4th of July event, we saw four orange lights moving very slow and smoothly in the sky appearing and disappearing one at a time.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;3 minutes;During 4th of July event, we saw four orange lights moving very slow and smoothly in the sky appearing and disappearing one at a time. On July 4th, 2014, at about 10 pm mountain time.  I was watching the firework display in Arvada Colorado.  In the east, off to the right of the fireworks, I saw four orange yellowish lights slowly moving to the right, and then moving to the left in perfect sink.  At first I thought it was a part of the show, but after about a minute of watching, I told my wife and she agreed that it couldn't be a part of the show.  We both watched as the lights moved very slowly from side to side.  Then, while in continued slow smooth motion, one light disappeared and then another light disappeared, and then another, until one light remained. It remained in continued slow steady motion. The other lights then reappeared one at a time until all four lights appeared. Once again, they all appeared to be moving slow and steady from side to side in perfect sink. After about another minute the lights began to disappear one at a time until one light remained. The remaining light continu! ed movement but seemed to dip downward a bit before completely disappearing from site.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
Mysterious lights moving back/forth and up/down in the treeline.;2014-08-18 22:00:00;30 minutes;Mysterious lights moving back/forth and up/down in the treeline. Monday, August 18 in Arvada, CO, (near Standley Lake) – mysterious lights moving back/forth and up/down between 10:00 pm and 10:30 pm.  Sitting on my back patio I noticed a blue/red/white lights moving erratically due north, about 20 degrees above the horizon (near the base of the Big Dipper). The lights moved in a fashion similar to somebody pointing a laser pointing at a wall and moving it around erratically.  However, these lights were much bigger and were blue/white/red, depending on which way the lights were moving. From my back porch, I sit about even with the treeline.  I could see a blinking light moving up/down and back/forth up out of the treeline, and above/down into the treeline.  The lights would do this for about 30 seconds, then stop for about 5 minutes , then start again.  The happened for about 30 minutes. At about 10:15, I also noticed, what looked like, a shooting star heading in the general direction of the moving lights.  I thought it was a shooting star, until I realized there was some cloud cover in that direction, so the “shooting star” had to be in front of the cloud cover (which I thought was strange)  At about 10:30 pm, I got in my car and drove about a mile north to get a better view, overlooking Standley Lake.  However, by this time the lights had disappeared.    The sighting was in the general direction of Rocky Mountain Airport.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
Four UFOs flying in diamond pattern seen over Arvada, CO.;2015-11-01 18:08:00;5 minutes;Four UFOs flying in diamond pattern seen over Arvada, CO Hi there! My boyfriend (a police officer) and I (molecular lab tech) had both just left my house in Arvada, driving in two different directions and we both saw four, slow-moving, almost hovering oval shapes in the sky that definitely were not helicopters or planes.   They were moving very close together in a diamond shape and were emitting a yellowish-white light.  The light of one of them would fade slowly in and out, as though it was possibly disappearing behind a cloud.  I tried to follow them toward the east but lost sight and they disappeared.   This is my first ever sighting.   I was able to take a picture on my mobile phone of two of them due to obstructed view.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
