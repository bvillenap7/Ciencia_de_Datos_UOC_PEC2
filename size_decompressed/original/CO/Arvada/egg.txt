In a blue, cloudless sky I saw another object moving in the opposite direction across the sky. I didn't have the shape of the jet I saw, but appeared to be oblong and slowly spinning around. I could tell this by the way the sun was reflecting off of it. It also had a halo around itsort of like the moon has at night. I watched it as it travelled across the sky and then stop. The lightof the object seem to get smaller so I assumed that it was moving away from the earth. I watched it for a couple of minutes and went into to get my video camera and when I went back out on my deck 15 seconds later, it was gone. Anyway, I thought I would go on record as having witness this event.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
