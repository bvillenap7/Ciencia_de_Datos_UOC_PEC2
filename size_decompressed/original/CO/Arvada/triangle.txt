HUGE Triangle UFO spotted over Denver;2001-08-12 09:20:00;2 Minutes;HUGE Triangle UFO spotted over Denver In this event, I was shocked to see this object.  At least a couple of football fields long, made no sound whatsoever.  It was around 9:20 Mountain Daylight Time.  August 12 of 2001.  I was so extatic.  I rushed into my house to grab the digital camara.  I also was able to take several pictures of this craft. At first, I thought it was two seperate craft with bright red pulsating lights.  However, they were in syncronization with each other.  So therefore it had to be one craft.  They were coming from the direction of Rocky Flatts (nuclear facility) and also our local small airport here.  It was moving from the NW to the SE in the direction of Downtown Denver so I'm hoping a lot more people would have seen this object.  If you have any questions, my email is ((e-address deleted))  you may request photos of this sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the photograph.  It is not clear whether the sighting occurred during daytime, or at night.  We will attempt to clarify this point with the witness.  PD));39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
silent v shape  craft , no light's, moving west to east, circles on bottom from center and two down the wings;2008-12-23 12:00:00;9 seconds;silent v shape  craft , no light's, moving west to east, circles on bottom from center and two down the wings 12/23/08- snow was on the ground and a clear full moon night.  Looked up and saw a boomerrang like craft flying from west to east.   Waited for a sound but only silent night surrounded, no lights whatsoever.  V shape and with dark circles on bottom, from center and two on wing sides.  Moving rather fast and only got a glimpse of it.  High enough in sky but low enough to catch reflection of moon light off the snow.   Again, on 08/15/09 saw the object flying westerly at same speed at 3:43 a.m. both nights a vivid array of shooting star activity..  Too dark to capture a picture, too fast to run and get my cheap camera phone to try.  I often wonder of whether this craft is of this region in the mountains, my instinct tells me that it is .perhaps.  Will keep the eye’s open.  You too.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
A triangular shaped object this a white light at each vertex and a red light in the center.;2011-11-09 18:40:00;about 5 minutes;A triangular shaped object this a white light at each vertex and a red light in the center. On November 9th 2011, my brother and I ware driving down 80th Avenue going to our local church for a confirmation meeting at about 6:40pm.  My brother was driving. He looked to his left and said, What’s with the lights? I didn’t see them at the time because of the roof of the car.  I thought it was a plane or a street light or something. Then we pull up to the next intersection and he points it out again.  This time I see a vertical line of four lights.  One was red.  We turn onto the street where the church is off of and we get a better look at it and notice that it’s triangular shaped.  And the red light was in the middle.  And we also notice that it’s spinning slowly and moving.  We were basically following it though the parking lot of the church until we parked at one end of the parking lot.  The object was spinning slowly as it moved across the sky at about 30 or 40 mph. We get out of the car and watch it continue moving in the same direction (East) until it was too far away to see.  We also notice, after getting out of the car, that it was completely silent.  It was probably the most extraordinary things I have ever seen.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
Red Orbs.;2014-02-15 18:14:00;2 minutes;Red Orbs Witnessed three small Red Copper Orbs in formation.  Appeared and lasted about two minutes.   As we were coming in to the house, we saw lights pop on and formed a triangle pattern.  As we watched the objects pulsate, one began to slowly fade out in to a small copper dot.   Then the next two also began to fade out to nothing but a small dot.  The lights soon became nothing.   The direction they were flying was Westward towards the mountains. I had called several news stations to report and give my sighting to them.  And i also had heard that some people here in Denver, have reported drones flying around out city.   So, I am investigating that story as well.  If this is true, i might have very well have seen night time maneuvers here in Arvada.  I think its still UFO but not ruling out DRONES either.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
Triangle formation to horizontal line.;2017-05-03 02:04:00;3 minutes;Triangle formation to horizontal line. Went outside Friday/Saturday early morning from 12:50AM-2:30 to do my weekend star gazing.  While listening to Coast to Coast AM, at 2:04AM, I noticed, while looking up towards the sky to my NW position, a triangle V formation of lights!  Three pin dot lights of yellow/white color!  With three red colored lights as well!   The lights were in a triangle formation at the start, and ending in a horizontal line formation!  Noticed also three slow blinking red lights at its base!  Object did make a low hum sound as it flew over my backyard!  Moon was also setting west over the front range foothills/mountains.  My first thought was a B-2 or Stealth fighter!  But was too large to be any!  Was bigger than any of our aircraft!  I also investigate as well!   Been a Ufo investigator for 17 years!  As my own private Ufo investigator, this was my first Tirangle/V shape sighting!  As to how high this was,estimate altitude was 7,000ft+.Temperture was 52 degrees out!  Clear skies!!;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294

I lifted my head away from the eye piece and saw 4 lightly flashing lights shaped like a triangle floating through the sky.  I followed it traveling from southwest to northeast for 5 seconds.  it moved beyond the horizon of the trees in my parking lot.  I heard no sound and I can't tell how far or big it was.  Best guess the size of a hot air balloon with the basket leading north east. I am located at 80th and sheridan in Arvada Colorado 80003 at 21:01.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
