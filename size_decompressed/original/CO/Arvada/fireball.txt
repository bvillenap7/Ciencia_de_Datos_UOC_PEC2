As I looked out the windshield, I saw a huge white ball of light with a tail, like a comet.  Several seconds later, the ball of light accelerated its speed and literally vanished into mid-air, almost looking like it entered into a invisible portal of some sort!   I freaked out and asked everyone in the vehicle if they saw the comet-like object disappear into mid air, and of course no one did besides myself.
