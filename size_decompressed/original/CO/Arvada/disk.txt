Rather large saucer shaped craft spotted over Denver.;2003-03-08 18:16:00;30 mins+;Rather large saucer shaped craft spotted over Denver. This took me awhile to report but I have taken photos to analyze the data of what I have seen. It was almost sundown and I was driving along Wadsworth Blvd southward.  When I noticed that this craft was sitting in the air still.  It was incredibly huge because I could see it at such a far distance (maybe 20+ miles away).  It stood there still for 20-30+ minutes because that's how long I've been driving. This looked to be more disk/saucer shaped object rather than anything else.  It didn't move erratically only just sat in one place.  But by the time sundown came, I lost sight of it due to its lack of light. There must have been hundreds of witnesses that day because Wadsworth Blvd is a rather busy street.  I'm hoping its true.  I will send the photos along with the enhanced version I have managed to detail.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
On a hill and 5 or so people watching this circle ship hovered above us and then took off.;2004-07-08 21:00:00;2 minutes;on a hill and 5 or so people watching this circle ship hovered above us and then took off. My friends and family were mountain boarding on this local hill roughly outside of town. During summer it gets dark later in the day, about half a hour once the sun fully set we all sit up on this hill.  Me and my cousin were the first to notice, but in the sky about 80 feet above us was this saucer.  It stopped above us.  This thing was crazy!  The machince was rotating fast, really fast to were it almost looked like it was still.  This inner circle had a dim light as well and light and somewhat windows at the top.  The level of peace that me and my friends had when we saw this was unbelieveable those who have had something like this happed would agree.  After 2 or so minutes and everyone now in the group watching this thing, it took off and flew 6 miles into the mountains.  The time to go into the mountains was roughly 20 seconds and it was gone as a blur of light.  This whole situation was comepletely silent even birds in the area had stopped chirping.
