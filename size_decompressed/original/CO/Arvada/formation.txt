It occurred to me that from my angle they could have been in a triangle formation.  I thought i may have been mistaking them for Orion's Belt, but they did not coincide with the constellation's location in the sky...AND they were gone ten minutes later.   I frequently observe the night sky from my backyard, and haven't seen this phenomenon before or since.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
8 objects flying completely silent with three lights each in the night sky;2015-10-16 13:15:00;20 seconds;8 objects flying completely silent with three lights each in the night sky Hard to tell what it was.  Looked potentially military but was oddly completely silent.   Looked like 8 craft with three lights, each flying in very close V-formation and seeming to move slightly independently, but in a very very tight formation that looked odd, and almost too close and right to be planes, all moving at the same speed.  Each craft had three lights In a triangle shape.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
7-9 glowing white lights in arrow formation flying east to west fast and low;2016-09-30 20:30:00;30 seconds;7-9 glowing white lights in arrow formation flying east to west fast and low Looking east I noticed a white glowing object traveling low and fast coming towards me as it got closer I noticed there were more lights with it around 7-9.they were in a arrow formation.  My first thought was, okay it's a comet breaking up but as it flew over my head I noticed they were all the exact same size and glowing the same white cream luminescent color and in almost perfect formation..there was no sound at all.whats crazy is I can stare east and see planes from a distance coming from DIA all the time but this just appeared.It was like you couldn't see them from afar until it got close to you.I star gaze all the time when I'm outside smoking a cigarette (bad habit), so I always see falling stars (comets) and single flying lights (satellites) but this was unexplainable.thats why I had to document it here.   P.S as soon as it was over my head I ran 10ft to the back door to yell at my wife to come see this and instead of her running straight out the back door f! rom the couch she paused to turn the thermostat off for the swamp cooler and it emitted sparks( something it never done before) by the time she ran out it was to late because my backyard neighbor has a big tree and it was out of view headed for the mountains.

I was standing outside facing W from approx. 64th and llamar.  I like to star gaze.  Out of seemingly nowhere.;2017-12-09 19:30:00;20 minutes;I was standing outside facing west from approximately 64th and Llamar.  I like to star gaze.  Out of seemingly nowhere a long line of blinking red and green lights just appeared in the sky, no big flash or start, it was very subtle. they were definitly lights though.  I thought they might be crane lights but there were thousands of them in a straight line that seemed to stretch for miles.   Maybe they were lights on an airplane, but they moved across the sky so slowly that you'd think they weren't even moving but over the course of a hour they slowly drifted westward.  A plane would've flown much faster across the sky at that distance relative to myself.  Best estimate of distance is at the start being maybe a half mile to a mile above me and a few miles to the south west.   There didn't seem to be any other lights.  It didn't do anything but rapidly blink between red and green and slowly drift west.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
Very long, perfect string of red lights evenly spaced with no sound moving slowly from east to west;2017-12-09 21:15:00;10 minutes;Very long, perfect string of red lights evenly spaced with no sound moving slowly from east to west At approx. 21:00 hrs through 21:15 hrs my mom was taking the dog out and noticed in the south eastern sky traveling to the south western sky, where Orion would be later in the night, a string of at least 12 visible lights that were red occasionally blinking white (one at a time but not in order) then going back to red.  The distance was unknown but there was no sound to be associated with the lights.   She came and got me about five minutes after she first noticed the lights.  They were evenly spaced and appeared to be moving slowly from east to west finally disappearing over the mountains.  I was able to grab image stabilizing binoculars which just made the red and white lights appear larger.  A minute passed and I grabbed my dad from inside and all three of us watched as the lights slowly moved over the mountains and disappeared.  At the end of the formation to the east there was another set of lights which looked like a normal plane which appeared to be following the red and white light formation.  The plane was lower in the sky to the other lights and moving at a different speed and angle and had normal blinking running lights including green.  What really stood out was the exact distance of the lights to one another, the fact they appeared to be in a perfect line with no sound and the slow rate of speed.  It was impossible to tell wether it was one huge craft or many smaller crafts.   The following day on the news reported it was a military formation of C 130 (I think), performing training HALO mission flying to Nevada.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
34 Points of light traveling in a straight line equidistant from each other over the course of 8 minutes.;2020-02-27 05:00:00;8 minutes;34 Points of light traveling in a straight line equidistant from each other over the course of 8 minutes. On the morning of February 27th I was leaving for work at 5 am.  I looked up and saw what I first thought was a satellite moving from the northwest to the southeast.  But then noticed another moving in the same path behind the first some distance back, then another behind that moving in the same path, then another.  I began counting how many I saw continue in this fashion until I reached 34 total, all following in a straight line on the exact same path approximately equidistant from each other.  Of the 34 I counted all but about 4 followed the same path.  The other 4 were moving in the same general direction but on a different path a ways outside of the main path.  Also they all seemed to be traveling slightly faster than you normally see satellites moving.  I stood there watching this event for somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes.  I witnessed this from my home in Arvada.;39.8289982352941;-105.110888235294
