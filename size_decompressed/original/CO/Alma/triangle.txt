Massive triangle over NORAD for 4 hrs today!;2014-10-03 07:00:00;4 hours;Massive triangle over NORAD for 4 hrs today! Walking to the local store at 7am, I noticed 3 bright lights hanging in the sky.  They looked like stars in a perfect triangle and didn't move for four hours.   This was nothing man made, it was bigger than a football field and after the first hour military aircraft started flying all under and around it.   It looked to be over NORAD then it dissapeared one light at a time. The military jets are still searching the sky at 6pm.;39.2871;-106.0632
