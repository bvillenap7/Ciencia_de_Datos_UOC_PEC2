There was an object bobbing around and floating just above the mountains right on the horizon. It appeared orange with the naked eye.  My father and mother called me outside to watch it.  We got the binoculars and we could see that it was a saucer shape, and had running lights along the entire outside perimeter. It appeared to be spinning and or stretching and contracting.  It also appeared to have a tail end (that is what my mother and father saw, I did not see that).  My Dad said it moved from one point in the sky to the other and it was already in point B when I came out and watched it bob along. It finally disappeared over the mountains. What's more, is all the dogs in the neighborhood were going insane and when I came inside to file a report or at least look it up, my internet went down. Very strange.  It was pretty far away so it seems odd for the animals to be going crazy, but the dogs as well as coyotes could be heard barking and howling.;39.2027;-104.8518
