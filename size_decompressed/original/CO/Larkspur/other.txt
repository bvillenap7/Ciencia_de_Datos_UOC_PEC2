Loud noise and object.;2014-07-22 01:30:00;5 seconds;Loud noise and object I was awakened by a sound like several jets flying low overhead.  Really loud!  In the sky,  but off in the distance, not overhead -  I saw a large dark object, shaped like an almond, but big.  Behind it, and I couldnâ€™t tell if this was part of that object or a separate object, there were 6 or 8 white-rimmed red lights in a kind of a hexagon shape. It moved methodically behind the trees moving southeast, towards the Air Force Academy,  and the sound was gone.;39.2027;-104.8518
