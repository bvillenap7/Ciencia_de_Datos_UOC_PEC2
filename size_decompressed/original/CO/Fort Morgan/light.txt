Little tiny light;1996-04-15 05:30:00;2 minutes;Little tiny light I was heading to Nebraska, and it was early morning the sun had just crested the horizon when i looked out my delivery van and saw this little tiny light and i didn't think much of it until it shot straight up into the sky and dissappeared in roughly one second, and after that there were fighter jets cruising the area for about an hour.

At first I thought it was atop a radio tower (although I must admit I have never seen a blue lite on a tower before).   Within a second or two I observed what I initially thought was a second blue light, but in fact what I was seeing was the original blue lite moving rapidly to the southwest roughly parallel with the interstate hiway.   Although it isw impossible to accurately guage distances without a benchmark it is my estimate that the blue lite was not more than 10 miles north of the interstate at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft.  I had this lite in my view for approximately 8-10 seconds and saw it move at a speed that I believe was in excess of 500 mph.  I was driving northeasterly on the interstate at approx 80 mph so the lite and my car were more or less passing each other in opposite directions.  I called my wife's attention to the lite (she was a front seat passenger) and she was able to see the lite momentarily by looking over her shoulder through the back window of the car (something I could not do as a driver)   She saw the lite for only an instant before it disappeared into the west.   All of these events took place approximately opposite the Colorado DOT truck inspection station on the south side of the interstate several miles west of Ft. Morgan Colo.  I am convinced that the blue lite that I saw was not on an aircraft given its speed of movement and its relatively lo altitude.  In fact I have never seen an aircraft display a blue lite while in flight.I don't have a lot else to add to this report, but would be happy to answer additional questions if someone wishes to call me. ((NUFORC Note:  Report is confusing.  Witness indicates Ft. Morgan, DC, and Nebraska.  We have amended the report to reflect a location in Colorado.  PD));40.2524;-103.8013
Rounded ball of light seen S/SE in the early night sky, solid white, bluish edge with briefly visible reddish tail, falling downward.;2012-01-11 21:30:00;2-3 seconds;Rounded ball of light seen S/SE in the early night sky, solid white, bluish edge with briefly visible reddish tail, falling downward. In between the hours of 20:30 and 21:50(unknown exactly) I stepped outside for a cigarette on my back porch. Naturally I gaze at the stars on my smoke breaks.  I turned my vision in the direction of S/SE for just a moment, and through the trees I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star. The event lasted at least 3 seconds.  Orion was almost directly above me to the south. I saw a small flash of light which appeared to be rounded in shape.  The size of it was at least ten times the size of a star visible from earth, or 1/10 the size of the moon as seen from earth.  It was going in a downward motion almost as if it were falling out of the sky. It was visible for ~3 seconds, white in color with some faint bluish tint on its edge with a brief faint tail of bright reddish color. I witnessed the full event in my peripheral vision and my first thought was 'shooting star'(which i have seen many of)  On my second thought, what I had seen had a flight path unlike a shooting star and a duration at least 3x that of a shooting star.  I spent the next ten minutes waiting to see it again and contemplating what it could have been.  It failed to appear again. My background or level of interest in anomalies such as this is purely a star gazing hobby with limited knowledge of constellations and cosmic activity.  My age range is 18-25, I am male.  Also I was not under the influence of any controlled substances or alcohol at the time.  My final assumption of the event was that it was a satellite falling from space (something I've not witnessed), but some part of me believes this to have been a UFO of some type. These statements are to the best of my memory and descriptive abilities.;40.2524;-103.8013
But look like several moving stars crawling up into the sky into a sequence line.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-25 21:45:00;10 minutes;But look like several moving stars crawling up into the sky into a sequence line the 1st time it was about 30.  About 5 minutes later another twenny. You could see the satellite chasing it. It was in the NW sky starting from the horizon into the sky for 4-5 min minutes. When trying to record you could only hear a weird ticking noise and none of our voices.;40.2524;-103.8013
