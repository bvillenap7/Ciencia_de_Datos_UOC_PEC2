My family and I were going out to dinner at a restaurant and when we arrived at the restaurant in the sky we saw a fast moving sphere that left a jet stream mark in the sky..it was dusk.When we were eating we all disscussed what we had just seen.It was something that just made the hair stand up on the back of your neck.We finished eating and then were leaving, Outside we all seen the same thing again...then when my husband,my mom and my children and I got home we seen the same object land and it was sphere like and had all kinds of different lights around it and they were flashing fast...we could hardly believe our eyes we were all scared but if I would have reported it the police would have all said we were crazy.So we just watched it thru the window..nothing came out of it ...it just sat there. We all have been freaked out ever since, This happened in Log Lane Village.We have seen stuff before this but never knew there was a reporting sight. ((NUFORC Note:  If the object left a contrail, we assume that it might have been a high-altitude aircraft.  However, high-altitude aircraft usually are not visible by an observer on the ground for 25 minutes, given that the a/c would have covered hundreds of miles in that amount of time.
