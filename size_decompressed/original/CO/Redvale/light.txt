Blinking red light, low on horizon, flashing, moving up and down;2020-09-02 21:15:00;20 minutes;Blinking red light, low on horizon, flashing, moving up and down Around 9:15 on 9/2/2020 in Southwest Colorado, my daughter and I were looking at the sky.  We looked North from our home, the moon was on my left.  What we saw was a blinking red light moving east.  It was low to the horizon, lower than a normal plane would fly. We looked at it longer, and it moved up then back down, then flew straight and at times it appeared to blink and disappear, then reappear a little further away.  I watched it for about 20 minutes but it was there a little longer than that.  I wish I would have gotten a video, or knew of anyone else that saw something similar!;38.1878;-108.3897
