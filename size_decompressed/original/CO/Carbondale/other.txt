It was kind of silverish like the color of an F-16 jet.  It had massive structures on the bottom of it but I don't know about the top.  It covered up almost half of the sky.  I only remeber saying one thing and running before I have a complete loss of memory from that point on to about a few weeks later.  I kind of resembled the craft from the movie Independence Day but not quite that big. I could not see any lights because it was day.  I don't know anyone else that witnessed it but I'm sure other people did because there is a highway right next to the location.  I don't know if my friend remembers because I am no longer friends with him.;39.2511;-107.2044
