Yellow/orange sphere hovering 20' off the ground above a neighbors yard.;2016-01-27 17:33:00;5 seconds;Yellow/orange sphere hovering 20' off the ground above a neighbors yard. There were military helicopters flying around the mountains to the north that day.  I went outside to see if I could spot their lights and to the right I noticed what looked like a very bright yellow/orange ball of light sitting 20' above the ground approximately 2 houses east of me.  I was trying to figure out what it was, as it was not moving.   Then after about 5 seconds it looked like it was starting to melt and just disappeared like someone flipped a light switch.  No fire dripped off it.  We don't have street lights and it was very dark out, so I couldn't see anything of a craft outline.  No idea if it was a drone?   The light was about the size of a beach ball.  Very strange.  But not my first experience with strange things.;38.3874;-105.127
