Not positive about the time, but usually close my curtains around 8-9pm.  I usually look for the moon before closing my curtains.   That night, I happened to see a disk shaped, gray object flying maybe 200' off the ground, heading in a NNE direction.  It had red and white twinkling lights around the outer edge.  It had 4 orange lights on the bottom.  One kept going out and flickering, like it was not working properly.  The speed was similar to a small plane.   When it was near the Supermax prison the lights from the prison were bright enough that I could see 3 rounded projections on top of the craft.  I ran to get my camera, but when I got back to the door about 10 seconds later, I couldn't see it anywhere.  The guards at the prison should have been able to see it.   I'm a little confused as to why they didn't report this.;38.3874;-105.127
