two metallic boxes connected by a cylinder witnessed near Aguilar, Colorado;2000-03-15 15:00:00;10 minutes;two metallic boxes connected by a cylinder witnessed near Aguilar, Colorado I am reporting this sighting on behalf of my brother and mother who would never consider such a thing. According to them they were returning from home from a trip to Pueblo, CO in the afternoon and witnessed a craft that looked like two metalic boxes connected in the middle by a shorter cylinder. The craft was high in the sky and slow moving. It had no apparent wings and moved across the sky until out of view. They had enough time to stop the car and watch the object move out of view. The size of the craft was hard to determine because the skies were clear and blue, possibly the size of a large helicoptor or slightly larger. It was consistent in speed and did not appear to be moving with the wind.;37.3933;-104.6769
