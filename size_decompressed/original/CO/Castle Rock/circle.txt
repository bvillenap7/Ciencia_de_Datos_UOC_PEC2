Small White Light Around Sundown;2008-11-17 16:45:00;20 seconds;Small White Light Around Sundown I was driving on Highway 86 just east of Castle Rock and had just entered the Founders Village Subdivision off of Ridge Road. I saw a small white light out of my car window about a half mile from me in the air. The white light moved on a vertical trajectory and faded out after 20 seconds.  It was like a close falling star during sundown. Size of the object was about the size of a basketball.  It was round and very bright.  Made no noise.;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
Six objects in the sky in Castle Rock, CO.;2014-08-03 14:30:00;4-5 minutes;Six objects in the sky in Castle Rock, CO. I was hitting golf balls at the driving range at Red Hawk Ridge, a municipal golf course in Castle Rock, CO.  The driving range there is at the base of a butte.  The golfers face south to drive balls, looking directly at the butte.  The elevation provides for nice views of the town, surrounding landscapes and the Rocky Mountain peaks to the west. The afternoon sky was clear above with some clouds gathering in the west over the mountains.  I drove a ball (using a 7-iron) and as it climbed at first it seemed to stop and hover, but I immediately realized I lost track of the ball and my eye picked up another object in the sky.  It looked small, round and white like a golf ball, but much higher in the sky.  I thought perhaps it was a plane, so I stopped to watch it for a minute.  After a minute or so, I realized it couldn’t be a plane because it was not moving forward, it was just hovering. It’s not unusual for hawks to be flying around there, but this was much too high and looked rather inanimate.  My gaze wandered to the right (west) where I spotted 3 additional objects just like the original one.  There was another “tandem” object – the top part of that object looked like the other 4 and the bottom one looked like a larger version of it.  They were connected by a vertical line.  To draw it, it would be a small circle directly over a larger one, connected by a line.  There was one more object that looked a little more oval and it was red.  The four small white objects and the red one surrounded the tandem object. I looked away for minute and when I looked back they were still there.  They seemed to hover around for 4-5 minutes, then drift west a little and I lost track of them. Interesting.;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
