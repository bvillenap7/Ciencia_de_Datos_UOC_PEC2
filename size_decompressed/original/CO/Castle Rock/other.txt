Red Hot Air Balloon looking UFO in Castle Rock, CO;2012-06-17 15:30:00;2 minutes;Red Hot Air Balloon looking UFO in Castle Rock, CO I was having lunch at the Rockyard Brewery in Castle Rock, Co.  I stepped out for a smoke  in front of the building.  Directly across the street from the brewery, I saw what I initially thought was a smaller red hot air balloon moving slowly over the bank (don't know the name of the bank).   As I watched it move away from the bank, I noticed the sun shining on it and saw that it was metallic.  It was heading south at first, then changed direction in front of me and started heading east, gaining both speed and altitude.  It was only about 50-60 yards away from me when I first saw it. I called my friend to come out of the brewery to see it too, but by the time she came out, it sped up and was almost completely out of sight.;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
