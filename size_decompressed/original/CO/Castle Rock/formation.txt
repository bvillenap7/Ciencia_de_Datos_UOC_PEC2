But the lights were in a straight line and pointed close to a 45 degree angle close to the ground.  They seemed to have a shimmer and in the middle there was a white strobe light.  The size of the object appeared to me to be too large to be an aircraft moving at the slow of a speed.  The object was moving very slowly and almost appeared to hover.  What had also stood out to us is that the object made no noise.  We originally had seen the object moving in a North bound direction, and if it had flown in a straight line would have come very close to flying over our property.  The object also had a very low altitude.  It seemed to flying only 500-1000 feet above the ground.  ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded quite serious-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  He commented that the object(s) seen was (were) totally silent.  PD));39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
