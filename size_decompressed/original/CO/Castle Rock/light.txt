On Friday, September 26, 2008, I was standing on our deck with my daughter, looking at the sky when she noticed that there was a really bright star and asked what it was.  I looked and then realized that shouldn't be in that spot of the night sky (facing N/NW at a very low altitude). I went inside and grabbed my husband, and we watched it for about 5 minutes.  At first he thought it was a planet until it started flashing. It never moved, but kept getting brighter and putting off red and blue flashes, though it seemed like it was just one light or object that the flashes were coming from. We went inside and grabbed the binoculars and realized it was actually a cluster of 3 lights, white, red, and blue. My husband and I took turns on and off with the binoculars, while the other watched with the naked eye.  You couldn’t see it with the naked eye, but in the binoculars you could see that at first the lights were horizontally aligned, then would instantly change, though you couldn’t see the transition (even in the binoculars), to a pyramid shape, then to one on top of the other, with the third next to it. The lights pulsed one at a time, going around the formation. They were very rhythmic in their movement. About 15 or 20 minutes later, it still hadn't moved, when a plane came close to it. The plane had to suddenly adjust its course and go up and over it very quickly. As it did this, the lights jerked sideways, like they were moving out of the way. All in all, the lights stayed for almost 45 minutes in the same spot, and were relatively low, lower than normal air traffic. The plane was a small plane, headed right towards centennial airport.  There wasn't a sound associated with the lights, though you could hear the small plane as it flew past. The light then moved down and our vantage point was blocked by a tree across the parking lot from our apartment building, then reappeared at the top of the tree line.   The light then faded, almost like it was receding and heading N, NW, but staying at the same elevation, and then disappeared. All in all, the “event” lasted close to an hour.  We were facing the N/NW, in castle rock, the northern area, facing Sedalia, with RT 85/Santa Fe directly west of our apartment.  The “object” was no more than a mile or so away I’d say, and not very high in the air, maybe 200-500 ft?;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765

Looking over a hill, my brother, and myself saw a bright star in the sky.  Upon closer look appeared almost as if it were a flame or something in the sky burning.   After looking at it for about 20 seconds, it seemed to flash bright for a moment and then quickly was gone.;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
