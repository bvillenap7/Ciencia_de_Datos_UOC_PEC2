We saw a very bright white light, looked like the moon setting very quickly.;2001-01-11 20:50:00;3-4 seconds;We saw a very bright white light, looked like the moon setting very quickly. I was traveling south on Hwy 85 passing by Castle Pines Golf Club entrance.  Saw what I thought was a shooting star.  Very bright white light, looking to the east.  I have very dark tinted windows.  It had a slight arc.  I thought it may have been the moon at first, because it was so bright.  I then thought it may have been a firework of some kind and watched for more.  I did not notice a trail, since i was driving... ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness here is referring to the dramatic fireball at 2153 hrs. (Mountain) on this date, but we are not certain.  However, we have amended the time for her.  PD));39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
Green and orange fire ball shooting south across the sky at high velocity.;2002-10-07 08:00:00;6 sec;Green and orange fire ball shooting south across the sky at high velocity. I noted an ealier entry regarding this and it triggered my memeory of this occurance.  What I saw appeared to eminate from the ground in what I first took to be a large firework.  It traveled upward in an arc with a glowing green front and orange/red trail of sparks/fire behind.  It then lost its green glow all together and shot across the sky due south at an extreme rate of speed as a large ball, like a meteor.  It was rather large, I have seen a few meteors before that were suspected of hitting ground, but I had never seen anything of this size before.  I remember watching the news that night hoping to hear something about it but did not.  The initial upward arc with the green glow and orange trail before shooting of like a meteor to the south is what still really puzzles me. The witnesses included myself, a 41 year old Business Exec., my wife and 7 year old daughter. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports from Colorado, and surrounding states, of this event.  A similar event in the same area was reported on the prior day.  PD));39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
Bright orange light that changes speed then flickered out like a candle;2013-05-27 21:02:00;2 minutes;bright orange light that changes speed then flickered out like a candle I was walking out of a building looking west.  There was a bright orange light that at first I thought was a landing light of a small aircraft.  This bright orange light (brighter than surrounding stars) was heading east.  I was looking up from my location about 80 degrees vertical from horizon.  This light sped up rapidly then slowed down.   The whole time this light was flickering.  It was partly cloudy out and I realized that the abjoect was above clouds.  There was a little light left from sunset.  I thought it was a glare from an aircraft off the sunlight.  This object had to be well over 60000 feet up.  I never saw a contrail.   This light started to flicker like a candle was burning out.  The object slowed down once again and it started to make a turn to the south.  When it did this, it fkickered more and more and eventually it went completwly out into a clear sky. I observed closely afterwards and never saw any more flashing lights like that I would see of an aircraft.  It left me, my wife, my friend and my kids completely puzzled.;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
