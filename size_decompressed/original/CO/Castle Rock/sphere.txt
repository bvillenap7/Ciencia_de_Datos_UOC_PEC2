They came in about 1 minute apart travelling in the same direction with a slightly different flight path, speed and altitude â€“ no anomalous flight characteristics.  Each was an orb with a strong red light on the perimeter with an amber orange center.   The third object stopped illuminating red/amber lights just overhead and was a dull grey round object that then began to illuminate a small red light that then began to circle the object in a rotating fashion.

Seven reflective orbs in the Colorado sky.;2018-06-25 13:15:00;5 minutes;Seven reflective orbs in the Colorado sky. I was with my step-daughter driving up 5th Street in Castle Rock, near where Founders Parkway intersects, when I noticed seven orb-shaped objects very high in the sky.  They were too high to be kites, and definitely were not birds, since when they moved the sunlight reflected off of them.  The objects appeared to be moving in concert, flowing back and forth very quickly.  They were also too close together to be domestic aircraft.  I took my eyes off of them after about five minutes of watching, and could not find them in the sky again.   Conditions were sunny skies, temperature of 85 degrees, and clear.;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
3 spheres whitish yellow , seen Castle Rock coming from north heading south first, than abruptly changed direction head east;2019-11-10 06:30:00;15 minutes;3 spheres whitish yellow , seen Castle Rock coming from north heading south first, than abruptly changed direction head east Looking out window of house,  around 6:30 ish last night, I saw what appeared to be 3 large round or sphere (bigger than an average marble from my point of view) as I was looking out) The lights were  bright whitish-yellow (no flashes of red- not airplane) coming from the North (each one came from same direction but a little different path- went right over our neighborhood clearly heading east) They were separate at first but blended together /or came together as heading East. The first one change direction down to the south then abruptly halted/looked like it was floating,  and headed east. The second two also came about the same path. No sounds. Altitude as about 500-700 ft in the night sky when I first saw the 1st one, as it passed over our area.  There was absolutely no sound, and I was close enough to hear if it were a helicopter.  Again absolutely no flashing red lights- if anything when they passed over the light turned form yellow to green and all 3 o! f them moved silently almost directly over our backyard!  Later last night about 11:35 pm, many of us in our neighborhoods here in Castle Rock  heard a very large BOOM.;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
It was a silentl spherical orb of a dark color or transparently distorting the clouds behind it.;2020-12-30 21:00:00;&lt10s;It was a silentl spherical orb of a dark color or transparently distorting the clouds behind it. As I was observing what appeared to be 3 red flares dissapating in the distant night sky, a blur caught my attention. It appeared to be, at first, a small flock of birds lit by the city glow. It was too perfectly spherical to be anything flying naturally. As it silently crossed the sky above, I ran into the yard to get a better view. It reminded me of the old Windows 98 screensaver, the one with the rolling ball that distorted the desktop underneath. It was as though the flying sphere was distorting the hazy clouds behind it. I can't explain it in a way that makes sense because what I was seeing still doesn't make sense to me. It silently blurred across the entire sky in under ten seconds and disappeared just as quickly as it appeared. Whether or not the supposed flares have anything to do with all this is not clear.;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
