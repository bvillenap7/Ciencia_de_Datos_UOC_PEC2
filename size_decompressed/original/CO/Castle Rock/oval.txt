The first spotted ship was what seemed to be a bright star, when it started to sparkle I got my binoculars and saw much to my amazement a space ship!!   This huge oval shaped space ship was in clear view with my binoculars for over twenty minutes.  It was oval with white lights under it.  It stayed in this spot doing nothing.   Suddenly two rows of lights the colors were red, blue, green,yellow,white,orange,purple and a florescent pink, the two rows of lights were going oposite directions on the bottom of the ship at a rapid pace.  The ship stopped its lights moving and remained in the same spot for over 10 minutes.   The lights stayed off, but the ship appered to be lighting up the sky above it.  This went on for quite awhile.   Then the ship started doing tricks.  It turned side ways and spinned at a rapid pace, I could not see the colorful lights but noticed all white lights and then it stopped abruptly.  Then it shot out backwards and started spinning at an angel doing the same thing.  He shot forward and back several times while still turning.  It was shotting out very bright lights in front of it.  (like headlights or it appeared like it was taking photos or warding something off)?   After several minutes I saw another ship that was very far away and harder to see. This ship was doing the same thing in the direction of the bigger ship.  They were both lighting up the sky when they shot this light at eachother.  I watched this until I could no longer see the smaller ship.   The larger ship was slowly getting harder to see through my binoculars as he was moving out of range.  I watched this phenominal show for one hour.  I kept my eye on the large ship until he finally disapeared.;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
