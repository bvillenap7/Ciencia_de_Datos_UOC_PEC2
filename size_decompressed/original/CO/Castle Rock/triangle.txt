At around 2200 hours a small triangle object arrived in the Castle Rock area, it seemed to slow to a stop when another triangle shaped object appeared and slowed to a stop at the same location as the first one did.  The first triangle emmited a beam or a streak of light from the side of the craft and aimed it toward the other craft.  This light was a blueish in color and seemed to change with the movement of the other craft.  All of a sudden the second craft emitted a beam of its own, at that moment there appeared to be another object in the sky coming in close to them.  I could identify that it was indeed an airplane of some sort because of the red,blue, and white lights in a cross configuration.  When the two triangle objects noticed the third, the two triangles shot strait up in the sky then zig-zagged until they met up with a bigger triangle object that seemed to be sitting in the ladle of the big dipper.  The bigger object shot straight up and just disappeared.  The airplane left to the south, toward the Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs.  The whole time this was going on I was heading north on I-25 just past the city limits of Castle Rock.;39.3960080882354;-104.871004411765
