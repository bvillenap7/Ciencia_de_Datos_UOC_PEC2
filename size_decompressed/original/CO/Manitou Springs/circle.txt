3ft round silver ball hovering down street and moving in seemingly precise path.;2013-10-20 08:15:00;1 minute;3ft round silver ball hovering down street and moving in seemingly precise path As I descended down the stairs of my home about 8:15am to go into the living room, I noticed out the front window what appeared to be a silver ball (about the size of a large fitness ball) coming down the street.  It caught my eye because of its shiny, bright reflection. It appeared smooth and without ridges or seams. I really paid attention as it made a sharp left into my driveway and across my front yard.  At that point I could see that the object was not rolling as I had expected, but instead seemed to hover roughly 3 feet off the ground.  There was no waiver in its movement.  It was perfectly round and reflective so I was unsure if it was spinning or just travelling in a stationary position. The sphere moved out of sight and I did not go outside to pursue it.
