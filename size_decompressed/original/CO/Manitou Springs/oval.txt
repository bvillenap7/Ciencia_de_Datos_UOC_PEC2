((anonymous report));2016-09-18 20:10:00;18 seconds;Fireball over Colorado Springs, west to east, slows down turns, and then moves north. I saw what looked like a huge fireball coming west to east over Ute Pass area.  I was in Manitou Springs. and it went right over me.  I ran in to grab my phone and when I was back outside it was further away and my phone camera did not pick it up.  It seemed to stay still then made abrupt move quickly but not far.  I think it then went north but seemed to fade away. It was very big seemed kind of low.  It looked like a ball of fire, orange and some red moving within itself like flames.  I also saw what looked like a beam of light coming out and moving around.  It was coming down over the mountains fast toward Colorado Springs then seemed to go higher then seemed be still over Colorado Springs moving around like it was looking around then faded to the north.
