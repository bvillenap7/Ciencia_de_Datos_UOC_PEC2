Glowing red, egg-shaped object standing upright with small end down with white light on small tip. North to south travel.;2014-11-26 17:00:00;3:00;Glowing red, egg-shaped object standing upright with small end down with white light on small tip.  North to south travel. Just after sunset, an egg-shaped object, approximately 100 feet tall, with small end pointing half-way between the direction of movement and down, was traveling in a zig-zag pattern from north to south along the front range starting near Boulder, CO, and disappearing just south of Golden, CO, at approximately 1500 feet AGL or 6500 MSL in altitude.   The object was traveling at a fairly high rate of speed, best guess is in excess of 250 knots as we watch aircraft traverse this part of the horizon regularly.   The object was glowing red with a white/yellowish light forming a beam coming out of the small end.   There was no sound, no anti-collision, navigation, or strobe lights all of which are required for aircraft by the FAA.   The object seemed to hover at the end and then shot straight up out of sight at a very high rate of speed.   I have a commercial pilot's license with an instrument rating and can am familiar with, and can identify, most aircraft easily from the  range of this incident.;39.7744;-105.0972
