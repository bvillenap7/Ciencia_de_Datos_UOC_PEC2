A Brilliant White Light Like I have never seen before..;2010-08-19 17:30:00;2 minutes;A Brilliant White Light Like I have never seen before.. Saw a UFO tonight while driving home from work.. Looked up to my right and saw this brilliant white light, it was like the lights of a car coming at me but up in the air.  The size was massive, easily 10-20 times the size of airplane lights.  Then it blinked and was gone, Keep in mind I was driving the entire time and almost came to a dead stop on the interstate... Then red lights apeared in pairs and started darting back and forth across the sky right where the big white light had been.  My eyes couldnt focus on the lights they were just bouncing back and forth, it was a trip....   Then the lights stoped bouncing and stayed in one place, before moving on like an airplane would. â€¦;39.7744;-105.0972
