I notice there was a round circular object moving in the sky.  The object is changing into a shiny star like figure and it was opening up and unfolding.  I walked outside to get a better look and it was a spectacular light star that I was so overwhelmed by the changing form of the object.  My little 5 year old nephew was also seeing it unfold and I told him to grab my cell phone from the sofa.  He grabbed it and handed it to me so I could take a few pictures.  The object split into two and changed into a black circular object and there was another light white circular object below it.  It fades away into the clouds.;39.7744;-105.0972
