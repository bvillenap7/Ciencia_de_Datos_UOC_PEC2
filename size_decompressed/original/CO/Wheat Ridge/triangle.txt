Triangle Bright light formation flying sideways;2007-07-22 22:12:00;20 minutes;Triangle Bright light formation flying sideways My mother and I were driving home from the grocery store when she said to look up at the sky and we saw three big BRIGHT lights that did not flash or anything shaped like a triangle just hovering in the sky, the lights were bright like high beams on a car not like that of a star...within the time it took me to pull out of the parking lot onto the road the lights vanished...then as we were driving East on 32nd Ave we saw the lights again hovering lower than the first time as I kept driving it rapidly flew sideways higher up in the sky but much lower than that of a plane or helicopter...also there were planes and helicopters flying in other parts of the sky and had blue and red flashing lights this bright light formation was sure as heck not a plane or helicopter!! as I turned Left (North) onto Wadsworth Blvd to try to follow it, it just vanished into the sky. My mother and I used to think my Dad was crazy when he would watch these shows on TV about UFO sitings and crop formations and stuff of that nature but now since we have seen this crazy light formation...we truly believe that there is something out there!!!!;39.7744;-105.0972
