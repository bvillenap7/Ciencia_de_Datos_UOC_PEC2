Ten to twelve crafts spotted in Wheat Ridge CO at dusk February 12, 2008;2008-02-12 17:30:00;2-3min;Ten to twelve crafts spotted in Wheat Ridge CO at dusk February 12, 2008 Looked up to see what I thought was a flock of birds circling high in the sky directly above me. I realized that it was nearly dusk and each object was illuminated. The light was natural in color and dim.  They broke from the circular formation and began smoothly moving in and out of formation as they moved northwest. Two of them then separated and flew off a small distance from the group and then returned. The two crafts were synchronized in flight and unusually close together considering the maneuvers they were executing.  I continued watching as they flew out of my line of sight to the NW. The crafts seemed to be 6 or 8 sided but generally circular in nature.;39.7744;-105.0972
