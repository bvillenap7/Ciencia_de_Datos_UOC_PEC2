Strange lights over Denver 01/18/2015.;2015-01-18 01:30:00;20+ minutes;strange lights over Denver 01/18/2015 I saw a light in the southern sky over Denver. I took some video with my phone as well as some pictures. The light was moving like someone was playing with a laser pointer with a cat.  I had trouble keeping my camera trained on it.  I watched the light for about five mins before I got my phone.   I took about fifteen minutes of video and some all shots.  I went inside for about twenty minutes.  Then went back outside to see if it was still there, and it was.   It moved slowly at times and very fast at times.  It changed directions faster than anything I have ever seen. When I examened the pictures.  I was able to zoom in and see the different shapes the craft took.  I would like some help examining what I have.;39.7744;-105.0972
