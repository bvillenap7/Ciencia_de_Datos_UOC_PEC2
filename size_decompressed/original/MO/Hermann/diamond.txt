On the afternoon of July 16, 2009 I saw in a field just on the outskirts of Hermann, Missouri, a diamond shaped-silver lined UFO in a field.  It seemed to have images within it and for some reason I immediately thought I could see another dimension. I told my 15-year-old son to look but before he could focus on it, it folded in on itself and disappeared. Oddly, the next day, I woke up from an afternoon nap and couldnâ€™t move. After over an hour I could start to move, but am still having problems with walking, etc. All kinds of tests have been done with no answers. Whether or not these are related, I have no idea but the more I think about what I saw, the more I felt it should be reported.;38.6039142857143;-91.4937
