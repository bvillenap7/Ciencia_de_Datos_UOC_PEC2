I was witness to an UFO on the morning of August 23, 2012. It was outside my window (Several  hundred yards away and was cigar shaped) and I had the feeling I was being watched. It was hovering for about five minutes, then disappeared. The next evening (about the same time) I was also witness to two “aliens”. They appeared in my living room, where I had been sleeping on the sofa. There were two of them and they had elongated heads and large eyes. They were shorter than most humans and had skin that was brown and wrinkled looking. I felt afraid but one of them said, “Do not be afraid. We are here to help you.” Just after that they began fading away and disappeared. The next day several electrical appliciance turned themselves off.;38.6039142857143;-91.4937
