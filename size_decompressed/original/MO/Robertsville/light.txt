White light resembling shooting star creates electrical havoc.;2004-07-09 01:15:00;10 seconds;White light resembling shooting star creates electrical havoc. Initially I thought I saw a shooting star.  As I watched the shooting star moving from west to the east I thought this is lasting too long and moving to far across the night sky.  It moved no where near the speed of a shooting star, but a hell of a lot faster than an aircraft.  My wife had gone to bed around 12:30, I was still up to check on one of our Miniature Donkeys who I thought was ready to foal that night.  Although I thought the event was strange, I was really creeped out over the next few days when I discovered all of my GFI's (Gound Fault Interupters) were tripped in my house and in the pastures around the farm, two of my electric fence chargers had shorted out, and the central air flipped the circuit breaker twice in a 24 hour period (It had never flipped the breaker before).

03/18/12 Robertsville mo 4 high altitude  fast zig zagging UFOs over south /south east sky;2012-03-18 04:45:00;30 sec;03/18/12 Robertsville mo 4 high altitude  fast zig zagging UFOs over south /south east sky 03/18/12 I was on porch today  smoking my morning cigg looking to the south west and looked left toward the south / south east  and seen 4 high flying zig zagging objects moving at high speed much higher than the normal planes I see all the time, the objects made turns 90 degrees and shot around faster than a falling star  but were constant and as bright as a star that one could see on a clear night , this is my first experience encountering these objects, they were like bright  ping pong balls that were intelligent moving fast and very precise maneuvering around together like a group but doing things I've never seen like stopping and going 90 degree turns and  reverseing and then disappeared behind the trees on the horizon , but we're still very high altitude . I have seen planes, comets, satellites,  ext this was different enought that I got online to find out how to report what I saw.
