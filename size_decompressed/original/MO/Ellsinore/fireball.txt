Fireball that split into 7 different objects;2005-11-06 19:50:00;15-20 seconds;Fireball that split into 7 different objects We live in the country.  We have 40 ft of living room windows that we leave open most of the time.   We were watching Cold Case and all of the sudden a bright orange fireball appeared in the sky and then split into two, traveled for 4-5 seconds and then disappeared.   Out into the yard we went.  During the next 20 minutes we saw another appear and then split. Finally, the last site we had was when one appeared and split into 7 fireballs.   That lasted about 10 seconds and then it was gone.  We lingered for awhile longer but no more activity.   The intensity of the yellow-orange lights was so bright.;36.9487;-90.7493
