The shape started as a cros then the lights quickly changed formation and formed a straight line. The formation slowed and speeded up and went out of view to the north.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
We watched 4 lights expand and contract at astonishing speeds in the night sky, then vanish.;2005-09-28 01:38:00;20 seconds;We watched 4 lights expand and contract at astonishing speeds in the night sky, then vanish. It was the 1st really cool evening of the season and my husband and I were admiring how clear and crisp the sky was.  We have always enjoyed star gazing together and the sky always seems to be clearer when it's cool.   We had been sitting out there for a couple of hours when my husband said, What is that?!  He pointed directly overhead.  When I looked up, It was obviously a plane.   At that very second we simultaneously said, it's a plane.   There were 4 lights in a very tight diamond formation traveling north.  Then, almost immediately after we spoke, the lights started to separate from each other at an unbelievable speed.  The top light of the diamond shot straight out while the 2 outter lights expanded outward and forward until they were in line with the 1st.  Now, the 1st light and outter 2 are in a perfect row across the sky with the 4th tailing right behind the 1st.  The distance between the 3 lights in front was enormous.  They traveled at ungodly speed in this manner for about 5 seconds.   After about 5 seconds they shot back together again into the same tight diamond formation.  This also happened in a matter of seconds.  Then, out of no where, it vanished!  It vanished like someone unplugged the lights.  We were stunned.  We lived within 8 miles of Lambert Airport for 9 yrs, including through 9/11, and have, many times, seen aircrafts that we hadn't seen anything like before.  However, we have never seen anything even remotely close to this.   My husband said that when he 1st looked up, it looked like a misty cloud.  He said there was something very strange about it.  The sky was very clear and there wasn't another cloud in the sky.  No sooner than he had drawn my attention to the thing it had changed and appeared to be a plane.  He assumed the plane was momentarily hidden behind the cloud although the cloud was not there at all once the lights became visible.   We observed that the lights seemed to expand and contract.  When they were together they didn't seem odd.  When expanding the speed was astounding and they must have separated at least a mile apart in a matter of seconds.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
Shape shifting object seen over Friedens, Bright changing lights;2013-06-04 23:30:00;1 hour;Shape shifting object seen over Friedens, Bright changing lights Without the aid of binoculars it appeared as an orb of light that changed colors. It flew in view from left to right, up and down, rotated or spun at random, as well as sat in one place. The center section was white, and the sides where red and green. There was nothing that could be seen that connected the light bars together.  When observed with the naked eye it appeared to be an orb and had a glow or haze that changed color. It also sporadically changed speed, as well as color.  The lights would change position and almost appear to be playing tag with each other (making it seem as though each light was a singular entity only to join back together horizontally or vertically before flying off)  The bars of light that shone bright twice, and directly across from the 3 of us witnesses were bright white/blue and  did not change color.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
