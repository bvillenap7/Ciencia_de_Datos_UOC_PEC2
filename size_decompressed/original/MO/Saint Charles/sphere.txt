It then lifted diagonally, then shot off using a zig-zag pattern at a high rate of speed, we watched the police chase it up and down Mc Clay rd for several more minutes.

There was no noise.It just disappeared after about 5 seconds. It did not change direction, justdissappeared. Friday, 7/4/97, approximately 9:15pm, St. Charles, MO.  This is about 30 minutes from downtown St. Louis.My family and I (as well as probably 30,000 others) were at the St. Charles riverfront to watch fireworks.  It had just started to get dark and we knew the fireworks would be starting any time.  I was looking into the sky to the south of where I was sitting and I saw a light streak across the sky.  It went in an east-west direction.  It was pretty bright.  It was blue, maybe blue-green.  It made no noise at all. It traveled in a straight path for probably at least fives econds.   Then it just disappeared.  It did not change direction, it just disappeared.  It didn't even fade out.  It was obviously not a firework, but I didn't know what it was.  I figured itmust have been a firework, or a plane on fire, or an asteroid or something.  But it was really too bright for any of that.  It didn't actually have a tail, it was more of a streak of light.  Fireworks started 15 minutes later.   I am a computer systems analyst.  My girlfriend is a cash dept.supervisor.  My father is an engineer for McDonnell Douglas.  My friend is a cab driver.  We all saw it and asked 'what the hell was that?'.  Today, I heard reports that others had seen it in Collinsville, IL.  But nothing was said about in St. Louis/St. Charles. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports of this incident, which was very interesting.  First reported by an FAA Air Traffic Controller in the tower at the Paducah, KY, airport, who witnessed the light descending vertically down in the northern sky.

Orange glowing sphere moving at constant speed and altitude.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from three airline pilots.  PD));2013-07-04 21:00:00;10 minutes;Orange glowing sphere moving at constant speed and altitude. Orange glowing sphere moving in a straight line from North to South at a constant altitude.  Witnesses located on the ground East of object.   Three of the witnesses are ATP rated pilots.  Could not be aircraft lights unless the navigation lights were of the wrong color and in the incorrect orientation (red on the left wing, green in the right wing).   Speed was difficult to gauge as the range to the object was unknown although it was obvious that the object was moving much too fast to be a balloon of any kind.  The altitude was estimated at 2500 to 3000 feet assuming it was as close as it appeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Report from three airline pilots.  PD));38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
