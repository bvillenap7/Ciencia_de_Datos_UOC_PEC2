Kept formation and flew east I was walking east on Elm street 1 block from Kings Highway.  I looked up and saw a formation of orange lights flying over appeared to be the Highway 370 bridge over the Missouri River area.   There were several round orangish lights that had a formation.  They were not an equal distance apart but kept the same distance apart.  As I was trying to get my iPhone for pictures I noticed 2-3 cars noticed it and stopped in the road as well to watch.  The formation stayed in formed and either flew or drifted to the east.  We heard no engines or propellers of any kind.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
