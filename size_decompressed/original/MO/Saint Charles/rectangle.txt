Black Rectangle;1999-06-15 12:00:00;15Min;Black Rectangle Probably about 8 or 9 years ago, several of my family members and I were on our way to a store driving on Highway 94 in Saint Charles County, MO, when one of us noticed a strange object in the sky.  The object was flat black, rectangular in shape (a very slightly elongated square), and flying very high (approx. 30,000 ft = with cruising altitude.). To give an idea of its size, in order to block it out, you would need to hold a dime in front of your eye at arm's length. It was too difficult to judge the object's speed as there were few other reference points at that altitude.  There was a pair of binoculars in the car, and when I focused in on the object I could only faintly make out two silver-ish objects that appeared to be the profiles of fighter jets flying a short distance ahead of the object at its upper and lower left corners. However, because of the height and angle at which they appeared it was difficult to make them out clearly.  Upon reaching the store, we all stood on the parking lot for awhile looking up at it several other people had also taken notice, before moving on. I remember hearing one mother explain to her son that the object was a stealth bomber. My dad was in the Air Force, I have my MS in Space Studies, and I am very familiar with most aircrafts including the stealth bomber. This most definitely was nothing of the sort, and I have never come across any other craft similar to what I saw that day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of sighting is approximate.
