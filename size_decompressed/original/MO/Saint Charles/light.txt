We had star watching when we noticed a star out of the north [it was aprox 35-45 deg. off of the horizon] when we saw 3 points of light approaching from different directions. 1 was at 90deg. 1 at aprox 160 deg. and 1 at 240 deg. When they got close, the star went nova. Then the 3 points of light backed away,& disappeared. Both ((deleted)) and I have gone years without saying anything, about this in fear for our futher career in the miltary.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196

Just before dusk, I looked up in the sky with my son and saw a large green object shooting across the sky like a comet, but at a much lower altitiude.  It was just above the clouds and did not have a trajectory of any firework.  It was traveling parallel to the ground from east to west.  Looking up, it traveled from approx. 11 o'clock to 2'oclock and lasted approx. 5 seconds then disappeared.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
Observed a blue-green light crossing the skyfrom Northeast to Southwest (paralleling theMissouri River).;1997-07-04 21:15:00;few seconds;Summary : Observed a blue-green light crossing the skyfrom Northeast to Southwest (paralleling theMissouri River). While waiting for the 4th of July fireworks tostart, my wife and several friends were lookingup at the night sky when the light crossed thesky.   There were broken to scattered clouds at about 2-3000 feet, and the light was visible through the clouds, but obviously above them.  Given the color, I assumed that some space junkhad re-entered and, containing a lot of copper, was burning up on re-entry.   Based on the speed of the object, we thought it was going the speed of a meteor.   All observors are college educated:engineer, teacher, pilot, and others.  None hadbeen drinking.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196

Moving, green orb over St. Charles/St. Louis, Missouri;2011-06-02 20:55:00;6 seconds;Moving, green orb over St. Charles/St. Louis, Missouri This evening, June 2, 2011, while sitting at my second floor office window at my computer, something caught my eye which turned my attention away from my computer screen to the upper corner of my window.  A small, green orb of light was traveling through the sky, from South to North, at a relatively high speed.  The light was not a clear point of light but rather looked as if it were traveling through clouds or a mist. The part that I found odd is that I live directly under the flight patterns of my local airport, which call for the planes to land or takeoff from east to west (as they are doing this evening and right now as I type this report).  The object was high enough that I could not make out what it was yet was low enough that it would have interfered with the flight airport flight patterns.   There were no blinking lights or sound to accompany it. The object continued overhead until it disappeared over the tree line from across the street. While it very well may have been a falling star or small meteorite, etc., the direction and interference with the air traffic certainly caught my attention and has caused quite the commotion in our household!;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
MO INVESTIGATORS GROUP:  All of a sudden about 6 more appeared and were flying in the same dir. as they were following the other 5.;2011-12-31 19:31:00;3 to 5 minutes;...all of a sudden about 6 more appeared and were flying in the same direction as they were following the other 5. Report taken by the Missouri Investigators Group.  http://ufomig.yolasite.com   My fiance and I were out on the back deck looking at a bright light that was moving very slow,,,real slow,,up in the sky because we were looking for the big dipper but came across this, couldnt tell if it was a star, or the space station or maybe a satalite,,,dont know when all of a sudden we saw these red orange lights moving across the sky and Laura said to me what is that?  I turned and looked and said I dont know.  There were about 5 of them they were moving from south to north flying in a group style broken formation except for the front 3, they were in a parrallel formation, when all of a sudden about 6 more appeared and were flying in the same direction as they were following the other 5. Laura ran inside and got the boys out and we all stood on the back porch deck watching them fly across the sky, when about 5 to 6 more showed up flying in the same direction as they were following the others. We just watched them fly across the sky in awe wondering what we were seeing.! I decided to call 911 and told the dispatcher what we saw and she told me they would look into it and then we hung up, then I called channel 2 news and told them,(Kelly)and she said she would have the meteorologist look into it and thats about it. I decided to look up a ufo sighting sight on the internet and came across this page to tell you about what we saw. I hope that we can get some clearity on this situation and also to find out if anyone else saw what we saw,, thanks..;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196

Hovering crafts dropping colored balls;2013-07-11 21:54:00;9 minutes;hovering crafts dropping colored balls The lights appeared towards the north of the sky in a horizontal form. The sight started off as just two lights.  The lights hovered next to each other changing positioning for about 4 minutes.  One light started moving quickly away and disappeared.  Then a third light appeared changing shape and moving in a circular motion with blue lights circling the craft.  We witnessed a distinct red ball and then a blue ball drop out of one.  The hovering continued for about 6 more minutes and then both disappeared.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
