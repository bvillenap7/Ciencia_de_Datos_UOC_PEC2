Fireball spotted over saint charles missouri;2011-07-04 21:43:00;10 minutes;Fireball spotted over saint charles missouri I was waiting at the entrance of my neighborhood for my fiancee to pick me up at about 9:15 and I saw a ball of light that looked like a fireball.  It hovered until 9:43 pm.   When my fiancee pulled up I yelled for her to get out her I phone and record it.  According to her phone, it was 9:43.   We recorded the event on her camera.  The ball of light was at least 5-10 miles away.   My fiancee that does not believe in UFO's saw this fireball as did I.  I asked her does that look like a helicopter to you and she said it doesnt look like a plane or helicopter.   I have been looking at the nights sky every night since the June 3, 2011 sighting.  This was not the red navigation lights that you see with the red, green. and white combination.  This was like a ball of fire that hovered for atleast 25 minutes.   It did not flash or flicker like helicopter lights it hovered and looked like a ball of fire. at about 9:40 pm, the ball of fire started moving very fast but my fiancee managed to record the event on her Iphone.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
8 - 10 fireball spheres moving very slow horizontally with no sound and no distinct shape;2012-01-11 19:45:00;2-4 minutes;8 - 10 fireball spheres moving very slow horizontally with no sound and no distinct shape I was walking my dog and when I turned into my driveway something above caught my eye.  When I looked up, there were a series of fireball-looking objects in the sky.  The shape is hard to describe as they were like spheres, but with no distinct shape, sort of like a fireball.  There was no sound from them at all, and they moved slowly like clouds floating horizontally.   The airspace they occupied looked like the same height in the sky as a small plane or helicopter, perhaps higher, but not as high as a jet.  There were at least 8 to 10 of them, and they were parallel to one another in series of two and three.   I went into my house and watched them from my second story window and then they just disappeared.  I could not tell if they went up, as one did look like it did, but I am not positive.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
