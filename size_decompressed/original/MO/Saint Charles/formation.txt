Two Orb- Like UFOs seen near Muggee Road in St. Charles, MO;2006-11-04 12:15:00;2 minutes;Two Orb- Like UFOs seen near Muggee Road in St. Charles, MO I was driving South on Muggee Road in St. Charles, MO. I stopped at a light, looked up, and saw(at about the 10/11 o'clock position, 500 ft.) an orb. No lights, just had a reflective exterior. It wasn't really moving, more like hovering. It startled me with its size. Then an identical orb appeared from thin air to the right of the 1st orb. Now I knew something wasn't right. I tried to get closer to the objects, as the treeline got higher, they became harder to see. Then about 30 seconds later 2 black U.S. Stealth Fighters flew over the top of my car towards the objects. Another two would follow about 10 seconds later. Perhaps chasing the objects or what not. The military fighters stayed in the air and kept making their rounds for a good half hour before they left the area.
