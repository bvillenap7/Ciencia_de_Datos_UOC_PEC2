On or about April 11, 2012, I stepped outside somewhere between the hours of 10 and 11 p.m.  There was sparse and light cloud cover but I was able to view the Big Dipper clearly, when I saw a brightly shaped chevron appear, flash twice and suddenly disappear, just vanish...no sound.   The entire viewing could not have lasted more than 2-3 seconds - but I have no doubt of what I saw.  At first, I could not even name it as a “chevron” without research.  Initially I described it to my husband as a V-shaped object, but wider at the top edges and narrower towards the ‘tail’.  I was thrilled to have seen it, but at the same time bewildered by its appearance.  There was no way I could judge size, however, in contrast to the dipper, lack of sound, brilliance and clarity…I would say large, but very distant.

And...  very, very low in the atmosphere.  Yet still much above the trees..  I could see VERY bright green lights..  about the size lights of a plane..  yet..  they were ALL green.. and just a tad larger than what they would appear on a plane, and at a much lower level.. or so it seemed.  Yet it seemed to be hovering and could see it through tree tops..  at that point, I walked in closer towards the trees and looking at it intensely. .   It suddenly, literally, jetted to one side a short distance to where it was concealed by the trees and I thought to myself that I would wait and watch for it to continue out from the side of the trees in direction it had went towards and see if maybe it WAS actually an airplane...  Rather than continuing sideways...  it went up..  then downward..  then up and out..  out so fast.. that it was simply gone.. in an instant.. and no airplane OR helicopter maneuvers that quickly in such short bursts..   Sooo...just what did I just see?  I got a really odd vibe and chills and ran inside as quickly as I could..  that just really freaked me out!!  O.o..  just.. what was I seeing?;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
