It was the summer of 1988 and I was staying with a new friend in St. Charles, Missouri. It was a very hot summer with many days over a 100 degrees. I awoke one night because of the heat and was having trouble falling back to sleep. Suddenly, I heard a quiet humming noise coming from outside. I got up and went to a window on the first floor of the apartment. Through the window, I saw an oval shaped craft hovering just above the treetops. It emmitted a soft and constant white light. It also emmitted a quiet and steady humming noise. It was not very large, maybe a little bit bigger than an average car. I was mesmerized and terrified at the same time. I wanted to wake up my friend, but I was afraid that it would leave. It stayed there for about a minute, then ascended slowly and flew out of sight. I checked the newspapers the next day, but did not find anything about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
