All silver perfect circle moving 30 times afaster than any plane in the sky.;2009-01-31 12:20:00;1 Minute;All silver perfect circle moving 30 times faster than any plane in the sky. Mind you the ground is covered with alot of snow pack so I was surprised to see a large silver circle object traveling Northeast at least 30 times that rate at which high altitude planes travel and away from the sun.  All the planes up there criss crossing then I see this thing just bolting in a unimanagable rate of speed and going in a straight line.  This could have been reflection of high noon sun on a passing satelite.  Either way it had no wings and was way above the highest of planes in the blue sky.  No trail what so ever. All silver perfect circle.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
White object moving in strange pattern vanishes into thin air.;2010-11-04 10:37:00;3 minutes;White object moving in strange pattern vanishes into thin air. I was driving down hwy 94 this mourning.  I was approaching the light in front of the QT at Ofallon Road going west.  I noticed a white object in the sky that resembled a plane pointed up as though it was climbing.   What got my attention was that the object appeared to be moving too fast across the sky and instead of climbing up it was moving sideways without moving up at all.   The position of my vehicle never changed.  I was moving in the same direction and eventually came to a stop at the light while I watched the object.  It appeared to stop and change directions while also changing shap and color to more of a silver color and then while I was watching it completely vanished.  The sky was clear and the object was very visible when it vanished.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196

After getting home we looked at our pictures and we noticed something was unusual I the bitten of the plane we zoomed in as close as we could and was surprised by what we saw;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
Diamond shaped silent craft with single light and 4 illuminated tapered trapezoidal wing segments.  ((anonymous report));2017-02-03 10:23:00;1 minute;Diamond shaped silent craft with single light and 4 illuminated tapered trapezoidal wing segments At approximately 1020 cst, when leaving a wedding, observed a flying craft flying in a straight line at approximately 100 mph away from St. Louis in a westward direction.  The sighting was notable as the craft only had one visible light on the forward of the craft, which was red and blinking at a speed consistent with aircraft lights, and also because the craft made no sound, and also for the distinct shape- what appeared to be four regular trapezoids illuminated from below narrowing and tilting slightly upwards away from the craft, some 15 degrees upward. The trapezoidal wing elements estimated were possibly 10 feet long by 7 feet wide. Attitude is estimated at around 2000 feet.  There was a local inversion layer as the moon were hazy that night. It was a fairly bright night and it is possible the orange illumination of the panels came from city light pollution.  There were no other unusual sounds sights or behaviors witnessed in the city. Night is also considered significant in unknown way as I had a very, very, very! detailed dream some years ago of the wedding chapel interior, including seeing in detail several items, despite never seeing them before. The wedding was of the child of a friend of a family member, so it held no personal significance and was not noteworthy outside of the green beans, which were good.
