As I got out of the car to take a closer look I was able to see that this was a circular craft that moved slow.  As I tried to get closer it pulled away down the street and then hovered at the end of the street.  It stayed there for a few minutes before heading towards 94.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196

Fast Moving Silver Ufo;2019-10-06 07:38:00;7 minutes;Fast Moving Silver Ufo Me and my Brother were on our way home and heading down South River Road and both saw a silver disc shaped ufo,  It was at least 20 feet longer than the standard airline planes and was flying very fast heading up the 360 bridge route.
