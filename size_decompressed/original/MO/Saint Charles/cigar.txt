Cigar shape with 3 port-hole windows, lit up with bright white light, moving slowly So. to No. Obvious pointed frame work(trianular lik;1998-09-10 21:00:00;25 seconds;Cigar shape with 3 port-hole windows, lit up with bright white light, moving slowly So. to No. Obvious pointed frame work(trianular like) on one end.  No noise, no trail, flying very low.  Possibly gray/silver in color. Around 2100 hrs I was sitting outside and saw a grayish/silver cigar like shape flying slowly across the sky going South to North (opposite of the flight path of aircraft going to Lambert Field).  It was flying very low and I could see obvious framework on the front end in a protruding triangular-like shape with an elbow on the side where I was viewing.  Similiar to placing a cigar into a large triangle and the bottom of the triangle being horizontal so it would be a stand if it were to land.  There were 3 large port- hole windows (that I could see) which illuminated bright white light.  There was no noise coming from it or any vapor trail.  It moved at a steady pace and kept going in a Northerly direction til out of site.  It really drew my attention not only because it was low but you never see any aircraft flying in that direction over my house because of the circling pattern of all of the aircraft waiting to land at Lambert Field.  Have also seen a bright green light falling to earth but it burned out right above my privacy fence so maybe SOME of the reports of the bright green glowing fireballs are just meteor showers even tho I must say I have never seen bright aqua-green meteors before.;38.7682410755146;-90.5551786041196
Fleet of UFO's seen.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly migratory birds?  PD));2007-05-18 11:00:00;15;Fleet of UFO's seen At first, my co-worker instant messaged me to come outside. I went out, there were white dots in the sky, 3 of them in a triangle formation, then there were 4 of them in a square formation. Then, they disappeared, only to come back one at a time, and take off. I went back inside, and he called me out again, as he sits next to a large window. There in the sky, I don't know how high up were 2 groups of a LOT of UFO's. The first group in sight had to have over 50 saucer shaped flying objects, close together, moving as a group, to the left and to the right. The second group had about 20 objects together, moving as a group. Eventually, they melded together, and then separated again. These were not bobbing up and down, not bouncing, but staying close together. Every so often, they would be lit up, and then they would disappear, this happened for about 10 minutes total, and then they just were gone. Unbelievable. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly migratory birds?
