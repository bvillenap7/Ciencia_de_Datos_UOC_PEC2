My wife and I were driving home at about 8:30 pm, April 26, 2008. In the western sky I noticed a long blue/green flash of light. The front part of the light was in a circular red, orange and yellow shape. My first thought was that it was a meteor but this object was in a horizontal position above the tree line.  The object was slowly moving for about 4-5 seconds and then all of a sudden it vanished. The sky was black and this was the only object I saw in the sky. The object appeared to be very long and skinny. The blue/green color appeared to be the tail end of the red, orange and yellow core.;38.6101;-90.56
