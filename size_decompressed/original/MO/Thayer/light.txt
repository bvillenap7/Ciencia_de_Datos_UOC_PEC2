We were driving to pick up our kids from a New Years Eve party when we saw 3 red lights in the southern sky.  They moved slow & steady, while dropping white flare looking lights out of the bottom.   They were clearly separated & one by one, disappeared.  They were at a very low altitude. Approximately 1000 feet AGL.  I am a pilot, so these were not normal aircraft.;36.5291;-91.5407
