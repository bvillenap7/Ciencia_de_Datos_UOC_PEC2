Orange reddish globes seen by two people;2015-05-02 21:10:00;10 minutes;Orange reddish globes seen by two people Last night, 5-2-15, approximately 2110 my wife who was standing on our front porch awoke me to come outside.  Looking to the east toward the Mississippi River, at about a 45 degree angle were three reddish orange glows, five times bigger than a star, in a perfect triangular shape sitting stagnant in the sky.   The lights remained stationary for several minutes as we observed 10-12 more globes coming out of one globe that was the farthest away from the triangle in the southeast moving northwest towards the triangle.   The globes then began to follow the triangular shape as it moved towards the northwest where they disappeared behind some clouds.   I would probably say we watched these for ten minutes.;39.7037999999997;-91.3841000000005
