Fire in the sky.;2013-08-20 20:30:00;30 seconds;Fire in the sky. Tuesday night I was heading north on Hwy 61 just past Hannibal, MO and I see fire hovering in the sky. Looking out my driver side window I got a great view of it for about 30 seconds.  It was not moving and I thought it might be a Chinese lantern but it was not floating up, it just sat statinary and I did not see any balloon.  I know others on the Hwy must have seen it and hope they will report it as well.   The fire looked a lot like a camp fire without the wood and appeared to be about 500 feet off the ground.;39.7037999999997;-91.3841000000005
