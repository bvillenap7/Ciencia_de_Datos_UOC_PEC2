Disappearing light.;2013-10-12 20:00:00;dark till around 9 pm;Disappearing light. My friend and I have been noticing a very bright light in the sky all summer and sat and watched it one night.  It is too bright to be a star.   You could see single lights on it the more you looked at it and it was almost hoovering.  It then slowly started to dim and fly off.   It was gone for about 30 seconds and then came back really bright.  It stayed for about 20 more minutes and did the same thing.  Faded and then came back.   The last time it did this was around 9 pm.  It faded and then flew away like a plane and disappeared up into the sky.   The color of it was a dull white light.  Not white enough like a star but almost like a street light color.   I have never in my life seen something like this.;39.0274;-94.2087
