While driving down B blacktop headed east listening to my raido my raido started to go stadic I was trying to get back in my station any station but non would come it. Then I looked over to my left and I spoted a very large disk shaped object to the left of me in a field aprox 500ft away.the disk was aprox. 100 ft off of the ground and the top was aprox. 1 yard above tree top level. There was no sound at all comming from it. The object was silver and the size of the disk was aprox. 300 ft in diameter. The craft was vertical with its' top facing the blacktop when I first spotted it. I slowed down my car and pulled over to the side of the blacktop and stoped the car. I couldn't beleive my eyes. This was really happening! As I watched the disk it began to rotate around and around slowly. Then it tilted to the left then to the right then ended up horizontal, still rotating around. About the time i was wishing someone else could see this thing . a car came along west bound. He also was seeing this disk and slowed down his car and said to me..What is it? I said,I don't know! He sat there looking at it for a few secounds then just looked at me and drove off. I stayed longer and then I had this wired feeling come over me and I decided to get outa there. I kept looking at the disk over my sholder until it was out of my sight. The whole expirence was exciting and dream like. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.0129;-91.8897

Disk flying low, coming in for a landing.;2008-11-06 18:30:00;1 min;Disk flying low, coming in for a landing. I do NOT believe in UFO's, but if I did I saw one that day 11/06/08. I made a note on my calendar on the day I saw it, and have told a few people about it. Searching on the Internet and found this website, and what got me is that a few others have seen a flying disk as well in the Auxvasse, Mo sky. I was driving North on Hwy. 54 to Mexico, Mo. and was a few miles south of the Auxvasse, Mo Exit. When I saw a Silver disk was on the left side of the split double lane highway out the front of my windshield. It was good size a covered one side on the 2-lane highway easy, it was only 200 ft above the ground and looked like it was coming in for a landing. It was a silver disk, with no lights, moving very slow and coming down. I was driving right for it and slowed way down from 70mph to almost a dead stop on the highway, because I was not going to drive under whatever it was. That's when I noticed the car on the other side of the highway had done the same thing, as well as the car behind me. I watched the disk go across the highway West to East, and just over the tops of the trees in the tree line on the right side of the highway I could see an open field through the tree line. After I looked over and the car behind me, was now beside me we looked at each other and he took of! f and went on down the highway. There was a gravel road right in front of me headed East County Road 158, the same way the disk was headed. I did not take the gravel road and follow it the disk, and have been mad at myself ever since for not.;39.0129;-91.8897
