I was watching TV when I happened to notice outside my patio door a very bright green light with a trail of white or yellow sparks for a tail.  It was going from west to east.   The path resembled a meteor but was very low in the sky about at a height of 15 to 20 degrees and it disappeared past the horizon in the east.   The night is clear, cold and I can’t see any stars right now.  I really don’t know what it was and I’m not prone to thinking all lights in the sky at night are Strange.  This is the first time I’ve encountered anything like this.  I don’t want to waste your time, however I thought you may get other reports, because it was so bright.   I have no idea how far it was away but the size would be about 20% of a man's thumbnail held up at arms length.;39.0129;-91.8897
