Size 6 to 8 FT.  The sun reflected off the object.  The color silver.  Strange patterns on exterior. Weather condition, Very clear bright blue sky. Object was not traveling at high rate of speed.  Distance roughly less then a mile up. I would say default cloud level.  But no clouds. The Object was thin.  Flying upwards, no sound at all was being made. The Object vanished.  It did not fly away. My wife was with me but I did not point out the object.  I did not want her to think I lost my mind. My eyes never left my line of site.  It was there for a good 2 minutes.;38.339;-90.4105
