Glowing orange balls appear and vanish;2005-04-12 22:15:00;5-10 Min;Glowing orange balls appear and vanish On the above stated night and time, I rode my bike home from the gym.  I was about to go inside when I decided to look at the night sky before I went to bed.  Though the trees in the East sky I saw 2 circular or spherical objects, one on top of the other.   At first I thought that another planet or star was close to Mars, since the color of them both was a vibrant orange.  Then I realized that there were two, and they were much larger than any star in the sky.   All at once they disappeared.  One minute later one appeared, then another.  They were both pretty far away from me by the looks of it 10 - 15 miles away.  Then I started thinking that they were fireworks, but these things didn't go up or down or fade, they just appeared and disappeared.   After about 20 seconds the first one disappeared then the second.   Now i just stared at the sky waiting for something else.  Then in a horizontal row one appeared then another then another for a total of 3.  the first one vanished and a fourth one appeared.  after about 20 seconds one after another they vanished.   I stared for 10 minutes into the sky after that, but nothing more happend.;39.9948;-91.7198
