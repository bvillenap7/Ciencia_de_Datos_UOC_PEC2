On February 24, 2009 at 5:30 AM I got up to let my 2 dogs outside, at which time it was still very dark outside.  Our house faces North an at a distance on the horizon, over the tree line I could see a very, very large lighted area.  I kept watching it wondering what it could possibly be.  It was way too large for an airplane or star.  I went to 3 different windows and could plainly see the light.  It looked as if the light was lighting an area as big as a footbal field or bigger.  As I watched, this thing moved slowly from left to right or from West to East and then stopped.  I walked into the kitchen and came back and it was gone. It would take a very large craft to light an area as large as I am talking about. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.4311;-91.0648
