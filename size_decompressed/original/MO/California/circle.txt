Round bright light that both hovered then zipped across entire sky;2011-10-23 03:10:00;10 minutes;Round bright light that both hovered then zipped across entire sky The first incident took place on Sunday, October 23rd, 2011 at approximately 3:10AM in the morning approximately 10 miles outside of California, MO.  We were driving home on highway 50 in the western direction from a weekend trip. My husband and I both witnessed what seemed to be a large circular light hovering in the sky. It seemed to be stationary in the sky so we assumed it was something like a light pole. However, the closer we drove towards the light, the light literally zipped across the entire night sky away from us. It then zipped both up and down across the sky, all very quickly. I remember the night sky being fairly clear that night as I was able to see stars in the sky. By the time we reacted the California, MO exit (Highway 50 and Highway 87 crossing), there was a women in a van pulled over who was also watching the light. We do not know who this woman was but stopped to see if she needed any help. At this point, she explained to us that she too saw the light. This is the first time that I have ever seen anything like this before and after a few days I was no longer thinking about that night until it happened again the next week.;38.624;-92.5437
