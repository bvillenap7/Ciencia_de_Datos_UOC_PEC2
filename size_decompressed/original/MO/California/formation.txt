They were really low but I could tell that they were big, and that they were all separate objects because they moved at different speeds at different times.  They appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away from me. A couple of them would fizzle out and a couple would blink, but still not in unison, before coming to a flying v formation.    The orange lights then began to move like a sidewinder, again headed west.  Then all of a sudden were gone.  They didn't fizzle out, they were just gone.   These lights were definitely not what I am a accustomed to seeing, having lived somewhat close to Whiteman afb, and also anytime I hear a plane or a helicopter I always look for it.  So I know what I am used to seeing, and this was way out of the ordinary.;38.624;-92.5437
