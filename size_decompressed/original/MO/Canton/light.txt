At about 23:00 hrs. we noticed a fairly bright light to the north of us.;1978-03-15 23:00:00;30 minutes;Reported to the Missouri Investigators Group. B. Becker ufomig@yahoo.com. A young lady and I were enjoying some personal time in my Suburban north of town (Canton). At about 23:00 hrs. we noticed a fairly bright light to the north of us.  It appeared to be an elliptical light just above the tree line and about two miles away.  It would slowly move to the west horizon then streak back to the full east horizon in less than a second.  The light would go out and then appear to come toward us then stop and blink out.  Very erratic flight sudden stops and starts much quicker than any aircraft I've ever seen. After about 30 minutes it went straight up and went out.  We stayed about 1t more minutes and never saw it again. FOLLOW UP:  The light was white.  Most lights of any source I've seen are circular or an orb. This light wasnâ€™t but elliptical, pointed at each end.  It was an object that was illuminated not a light beam.  It was a distinct shape. It's was above the trees at all times.  The tree line at the edge of the field was only a few feet wide just a fence row with open fields on the other side.  It never went down to the ground that we saw.  It did go upward occasionally. The turns it made were always sharp angles not curving.  The area were at is close to the Mississippi River but this wasn't River traffic lights as I had watched them several times before and since and this was very different.  This light was a focused dot not flared like the searchlights on boats.  At the time there weren't many houses in the area and any town to speak of was 30 miles north.  I had seen objects in the sky both day and night that I couldn't identify before and have since.  Never saw it go to the ground.
