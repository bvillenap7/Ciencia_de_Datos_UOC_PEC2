White&Blue Color.Turned slow over me&gone It came out of the bright blue sky with white clouds right above where I was fishing and was painted the same as the sky and clouds.  The front was long,lean,missle like with two windows.There were no wings or propellars to fly it and the end was curled like a pretzel and the tail was cut off straight like a bird's tail and had things on it that were curled too.  It made some noise, flew right over the trees and behind me over my new mobile home, two other witnesses on the road working painting stripes, it made a slow circle and came right back over me, only went up just a higher and after it past back over the small lake it was gone like it was never there.  Nest day, my neighbor when to see two friends 3 miles from here and told him what they saw and it was the same description.  I have prayed to see a UFO all my life and it was wonderful and I will never forget.;38.1879;-90.4286000000001
