He says to me hurry up check this out, so I ran up to the porch looked to where he was pointing in the sky, and I saw a huge object way up there hovering,the reason I say huge because of the distance aprox. 30,000 feet up. If you can find a big jet airliner in front of his trail of smoke youve got good eyes wouldnt you say? Anyway I had time to run and get my camera but in a panic I couldnt find it, so I ran back outside my uncle went and got binoculars out of his car to get a closer look at this thing. My neighbors noticed us looking up in amasement, they witnessed the object for several minutes then went to get her digital camera, I am looking at this object with my uncles binoculars let me describe what I saw. I saw no lights, heard no sounds, saw a huge v or triangular object hovering and very slowly moving to the south this was right after a storm had passed..  Four of us witnessed this I was wondering how many other people may have reported this today?;38.1879;-90.4286000000001
