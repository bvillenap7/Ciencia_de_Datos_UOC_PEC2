There had been a bad storm earlier, the road was wet and she drove cautiously at about 35/40mph over Highway 50 East. She went through Union, about 11 miles from Beaufort, and was heading toward the Bourbeuse River Bridge, a steel truss bridge, when she saw a brilliant light approaching in her rear view mirror... Before she could make an evasive move the car was hit. No sound was heard. Upon impact the car heated up, the windows fogged and the inside was bathed in light. The rear end was lifted. There was a vibration throughout. She could neither steer nor stop. She could see she was heading for the bridge,suddenly the car was dropped and she regained control. The light lifted over her car and disappear to the north. She crossed the bridge, got out, inspected the car, saw no damage,drove to the Arnold Police Dept. (Jefferson Co.). It was now approx. 1:40a. Arnold tells her to go back to Union. She got her husband and returned to Union. Union Police discover two shallow dents in the trunk lid about 22/24 in. apart, no other damage. A complaint is filed.

I blew it off because it looked like a plane coming head-on, but it stayed there for what seemed like forever and there were no landing lights. I had come to a complete stop, in awe, because as I was driving, I kept glancing back at the light and it didn't look like it was a plane turning anytime soon, and it never flew overhead. I was driving slow..keeping an eye on the light, and all at once it seemed to disappear.;38.4478470588236;-91.0214852941176
Slow moving line of &quotstars&quot;2021-05-29 21:00:00;10 seconds;Slow moving line of &quotstars&quot In South Union after dark, I saw what appeared to be ~30-40 lights in the Eastern part of the sky going North to South.  It looked like if you've ever seen a satellite at night like a shooting star but very slow with a constant speed and brightness with no blinking lights.  However, in this case there were about 30-40 of these stars that were fairly close together, moving in a line parallel with the horizon and in the Eastern sky going from North to South.  The stars did have a constant speed and the did not move up or down.  They were in a perfect line and covered roughly 25 degrees of the sky.  Eventually, they all just kind of slowly faded away as they made it further along the sky.  Either they became too far away to see or there was some hazy cloud cover they went behind.  I would estimate that the viewing angle would be right at 35-40 degrees from the horizon.;38.4478470588236;-91.0214852941176
