Four lights hover in sky, followed by fireballs circulating the night sky.;2012-07-04 22:00:00;7-8 minutes;Four lights hover in sky, followed by fireballs circulating the night sky. My eleven-year old son was watching fireworks from our back deck when he called me (his mom) and dad outside because he saw some lights. I didn’t think much about it because it was the fourth of July however, he pointed out four unusual red/orange lights that hovered in unison from the east to west direction.  Our back deck faces north. It was peculiar to see these lights drifting slowly from east to west against the night sky when there were plenty of fireworks.  The first three set of lights were in a triangle shape with the fourth trailing behind. We then called our oldest 17-year old son to see these lights and ask what he thought about them. Shortly after he came to see them we noticed that the first three set of lights in a triangle shape lost the first bottom left light, as it simply disappeared.  Our 17-year old also agreed how odd the lights appeared. We noticed some airplanes to the southeast of us, and we could slightly hear their engines.  The light! s hovered together and kept in the same distance for some time.  The lights began to trail behind a set of trees and as we moved to see if we could see them we noticed that the remaining two from the triangle disappeared, but the last trailing light remained. My eleven-year old son and I went further into the east section of our yard to see the light before it completely went behind the trees, but when we saw it it disappeared.  There was no noise or and sound with this object, and of course we could hear some loud booms from the fireworks in the sky.  My husband and I had not drunk any alcohol or anything like that and had just finished a cup of coffee when we saw this.  So we were very awake and aware of what was occurring. Later about 22:40, we saw something that looked like fireballs in the sky.  These “flames” looked like balls or firedrops hovering slowly in a circular pattern in the nightsky, which was interesting against the fireworks exploding in the sky. These lights a! ppeared to be observing. I went inside and grabbed my binocula! rs to lo ok at these objects. One in particular was unusually close and through the lens of the binoculars it still just looked like a firelight, but smaller?  We (my husband and I) carefully observed it to see whether it was a helicopter or an airplane of some sort take pictures of the fireworks. We are aware that aircraft taking pictures of fireworks is not unusual this time of year, yet we dismissed this possibility when they did not closely resemble aircraft.  We only wonder if anyone saw the same thing.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477

I thought it might be Jupiter until it went from a round shape to an elongated shape and began moving to the east (over the moon).  Called my husband & son to see it, they did.  It continued east very slowly for a few seconds and disappeared.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
2, three lighted triangle lights eject violet/blue lights.;2013-08-03 21:20:00;5-7 minutes;2, three lighted triangle lights eject violet/blue lights. I had seen a large light hovering North of 50hwy while heading west into lee's summit.  As we continued, the light began to shape into a 3 light triangle, the object on the left side of it began to shape into a 3 lighted triangle as well.  The lights were yellow-orange, not flickering, not blinking, no sound, no movement.   After I had mentioned it to my friend driving, the left triangle of lights began to fade one by one leading into the second triangle of lights, and began to eject small violent/blue lights which formed a straight line heading west.   The very last violet/blue light was quickly moving around the string of lights before getting in formation. The lights quickly dissipated after that. There was nothing else in the sky, no sound, nothing. While the lights were ejected the smaller violet/blue lights i attempted to take a video, but my camera phone began to malfunction.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
