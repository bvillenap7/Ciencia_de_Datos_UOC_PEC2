triangle with 3 white lights on the bottom and 1 red light on top;1996-09-17 05:00:00;10 minutes;triangle with 3 white lights on the bottom and 1 red light on top i was delivering newspapers on a saturday morning and had looked up in the sky from an area that i had just passed, i then noticed two white lights in the sky that looked strange that were approx. 100 to 150 feet off the ground i then was able to come back towards that area and could see under the craft to be able to see a third light making a perfect triangle from the bottom, at the time it was still to dark to see what was between the lights. on the top of the craft was a pulsating red glowing light, when i was able to get a better view i stopped my vehicle and got out and signaled the craft with my flashlight, it then dropped below the tree line and headed towards a lake area that is in the area i was in. i was able to go there but saw nothing else for about 10 minutes, i then noticed the red pulsating light going up and away towards the north. i called the local airport and they said nothing had flown in or out at 5:00 am.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Three solid white lights on a hovering triangular shaped craft.;2007-06-23 22:15:00;2 minutes;Three solid white lights on a hovering triangular shaped craft. I was driving home from work around 10:15 PM when I saw a solid hovering slightly moving craft about 200 feet in the air at a NW direction.  What puzzled me about the object is that I first saw two white round solid lights on it.  But when it changed directions I saw three solid white lights and could clearly see it was triangular shaped.  I drove faster to try and find a clearing so I could use my phone camcorder but it disappeared out of sight!  The time frame from me speeding up and finding a place to park was about ten seconds.  I know that this object was definitely not a plane, blimp, or helicopter!  I have worked in law enforcement and the military.  Further note my car stereo was off and my windows were down.  If it had been a plane or helicopter I would have been able to hear it!   Once again this was a dark hovering triangular shaped craft.  This is not the first time I have seen ufo's!  I have seen others on 4 other ocassions.  I just have not reported them, but this time I could not keep from reporting this.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Black triangle with lights and afterburner;2007-07-06 04:00:00;60 seconds;Black triangle with lights and afterburner I saw standing in my street at 4:00 am looking at the clouds with my friend. She was trying to point a cloud out and said the one above the cloud that plane is flying through then we looked at the plane and it was really funny looking. As it flew over us we could hear the engines and it was a black triangle with lights on the side and what looked like a afterburner on the back with blue lights also on the back. It looked as though there was a window (which reminded me of a submarine window)on the side with a lot of light coming out of it. My friend was looking at the bottom of the craft and she said it had three lights with a door in between the lights (so 2 doors total). It just flew over head and then was gone. Then a little later we saw this glowing ball that was changing colors in the sky and moving in zig-zag patterns. We watched this for about 2 hours trying to figure out if it was the triangle again or something else. After 2 hours all these jets came and got real close to the glowing ball. Then it seemed like everything just died down and there was nothing more to watch.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Lee's Summit UFO seen multiple times, moving quickly.;2010-03-26 21:50:00;4 mins;Lee's Summit UFO seen multiple times, moving quickly. Over my general Neighborhood in Lee's Summit (Downtown) We have seen A dome-triangle shaped UFO that passed the same exact path VERY close to us atlease 3 times, then got further in the sky and pass maybe 4 more time with red, white, and blue-green flashing lights.  No sound, too fast to be a plane, and left no path behind it.  (My brother tried taping it but it malfunctioned his phone);38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Black triangle in Lee's Summit, MO near Lake Jacomo;2010-05-22 21:24:00;10 minutes;Black triangle in Lee's Summit, MO near Lake Jacomo My 17 year old daughter and I were on our way to my oldest son’s home at approximately 9:24 p.m. on May 22, 2010. We were driving west on Colburn Road heading toward Highway 291 in Lee’s Summit, MO. The sky was clear to partly cloudy and there was little or no wind. There is a small airport near Colburn Road on Douglas Road in Lee’s Summit and I often watch the planes come and go while driving that strip of road. Tonight I was watching what I thought was a plane. The object had one red light and two white lights, pretty typical of the small planes which fly out of the tiny airport, except none of the lights on this plane were flashing like they usually do. I did not think anything of this because many times when a plane is coming at me head on, I cannot see the flashing tail light. As I got closer to the object I realized it was not a plane. The object was in the west heading east. I was driving west on Colburn Road. We had just passed Lake Jacomo and were i! n the outskirts of Lee’s Summit. As I got closer and finally under the object I looked up and realized the object was a black triangle and not a plane. It was completely black except for the three lights. I am an educated person who has a B.A. in Psychology and I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Counseling. I am aware of the Gestalt Theories and this was not my brain “filling in” lines. The sky blackened and there was no background filter light between the three lights on the object as it flew past me. The object was flying low and the night sky was not yet completely dark so I was able to get a very good look at it. I said something to my daughter who then looked at it and got very excited exclaiming, “I see it mom it is a triangle! I see it! I see it!” My next thought was it was a B2 bomber because Whiteman Air Force Base is only about 45 minutes away. However, as low as the object was flying it definitely was not a B2 because it was way too small. I have seen those fl! y around our area quite often and they are huge, especially wh! en flyin g low. I asked my daughter if she could track it, and she said she could. I made a u-turn to try and follow the object so I could get ahead of it and stop the car to get a really good look at it while standing still and hopefully take a picture on my cell phone. Unfortunately I lost the object in the street lights when I started heading east. While I was driving west the lights had been on the north side as I looked west. I was basically looking away from the lights and they were on my right side, which was the passenger side of the car. Now that I was driving east, the lights were shining in my eyes on the driver’s side of the car and I could not see the object anymore. However, my daughter still had the object in her sight and I followed it as she guided me. Then as I approached the intersection of 7 Highway and Colburn Road, my daughter stated the object had suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared into some clouds. We lost the object and I was unable to get! a really good look at it while standing still. I don’t know if anyone else witnessed this object in Lee’s Summit tonight and I don’t know exactly what it was. I can only say what it was not. It was not a B2 Bomber because it was too small and it was not one of the small planes that fly out of the municipal airport in Lee’s Summit because I have never seen any of those planes make that triangle shape. I drive that area daily and nightly to and from work and school and I have lived here for 10 years. I have seen planes come and go from that tiny municipal airport day and night and none of the planes have ever made the triangle shape I saw tonight. Though I am a believer in UFO’s, whenever I observe anything in the sky I do so with a very skeptical mindset. I always think of all possibilities before saying what I saw was “unexplained.” Tonight I honestly cannot think of anything that is as small as the object I saw and makes the shape of the black triangle which I saw in the! sky earlier this evening.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
large triangular shaped object flying very low and way too slow with white lights on the,bottom that revealed triangular shape.;2011-10-04 08:00:00;3 minutes;large triangular shaped object flying very low and way too slow with white lights on the,bottom that revealed triangular shape. We had just left shopping center and turned west.   As we approached the stop light I saw the object to the south east. I saw a large triangular shaped object.  I grabbed the steering wheel and told my fiance to look.  He did and wcame to the stop light. The object was so large and seemed way too low. My fiance said wow a stealth bomber.  I said no way why would it be flying,so,low.  Our Windows were down and there was no noise.  The UFO had white lights on its bottom.  It went over road just behind us and as soon as it passed over road it turned north north east.  It turned maybe 45 degrees. I could see lights under it when it went over.  It went over kohls and due to,traffic we had to go light wE green. I tried to,get a picture, traffic light cause too much glare.  However I just saw video of it on news. I can't imagine this object flying,so slowly and quietly and so low.  Maybe because it was so large but I've,never seen anything like this.  I know at,least 10 other cars witnessed exactly what I did.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
