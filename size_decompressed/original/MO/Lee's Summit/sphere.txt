At approximately 11:35 AM on the morning of June 9th, 2003 I and my neighbor, who I was visiting on his job site in Lenexa, Ks., was sitting around on his morning break when suddenly he jumped up and pointed to the sky and said  Jesus what was that? I had not seen the first of what was eventually to become a total of six(6) objects in all that came streaking across the sky from horizon to horizon at what appeared to be a great altitude and an enormous rate of speed. The individual objects appeared one at a time at about what seemed to be about 3-4 minute intervals, all coming out of the southwest and bearing to the northeast in what seemed to be a fanning out pattern orginating in the southwest. Each of the individual objects streaked across our plain of view from horizon to the top of a tree line (which was approximately 30 degress above the northeast horizon) in approximately 6-8 seconds. A vast distance in a relatively short amount of time. None of the objects had a wing span or tail and appeared to me as being just a bright silvery orb streaking across the sky without a vapor trail or a mechanical noise such as is found in commerical air flights or military flights. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the other witness to this event, and he sounded quite credible.  Both witnesses are former members of the military, and probably are very good witnesses.  Please see other report.  PD));38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
With binoculars this object was a round sphere covered with small white lights moving erratically horizonally, vertically and in circle;2008-09-19 02:00:00;15 minutes;With binoculars this object was a round sphere covered with small white lights moving erratically horizonally, vertically and in circle In the western sky at approximately 2:00 a.m. on 09/19/08, I observed what appeared to be two stars, not too far apart, one brighter than the other.  The brightest one started moving horizontally to the left and right and vertically very fast.  I watched it for two or three minutes to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was and then went to get binoculars.  When I put the binoculars on it, it continued to move left to right, up and down and then around in a small circle.  It appeared to be a round sphere with several small white lights all over it.  I watched it for about 15 minutes, became frightened and went inside the house.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Second sighting of same object two nights later.  Round, white lights with red and green flashing lights.;2008-09-21 21:00:00;15 minutes;Second sighting of same object two nights later.  Round, white lights with red and green flashing lights. Second sighting two nights later.   At approximately 21:00 on 9/21/08, a second sighting was seen in approximately the same spot in the western sky.  I called my husband to observe and we both watched it in the binoculars.  It had the same erratic movements horizonally left and right, vertically up and down, and in small circles.  It was a round sphere, with white lights and flashing red and green lights this time.  We watched it for about 10 minutes.  I call the local Sheriff and they told me they couldn't do anything about something in the sky and basically blew me off, not even bothering to take my name or ask any questions.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Orange glowing balls form a triangle in Lee's Summit, MO;2010-07-26 23:05:00;3-5 minutes;Orange glowing balls form a triangle in Lee's Summit, MO I was visiting on the back deck after dinner with six friends when one of them asked us what kind of a light that was over the trees.  I looked, and at first thought it was a star, but it was orange.  Another one blinked into focus, and the two got brighter and moved toward eachother. We talked and discussed if they were moving, what color they were and mentioned that we had not seen anything like that before.  Then another orange glowing ball was seen below the tree line and rose up to join the other two. The three orange spheres made a triangle with the two points on top and the third on bottom.  The top left point started fading away and was gone in a matter of a few seconds as the third light was getting brighter.  The second light started fading shortly after that and was gone. The third light hovered for maybe a couple minutes or more...long enough for us to completely look at it and discuss the other two’s disappearance...then slowly started fading too.  The third on faded more slowly than the others. The incident wasn’t exceptional or fantastic by any means...just three glowing orange balls that moved, hovered and dissipated above the tree line and off in the distance.   None of us could explain it or had ever seen anything like it before.  We googled ‘glowing orange balls lee’s summit mo’ and discovered other unexplained stories of the same nature.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
