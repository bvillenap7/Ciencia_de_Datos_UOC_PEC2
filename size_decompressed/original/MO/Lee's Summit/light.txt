Multiple LITS abserved for 4-5 minutes dropping below horizon then returning 15-20 degrees from orignal location.;1993-03-15 20:30:00;four minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date so that the report sorts to the year 1993.  PD)) Multiple LITS abserved for 4-5 minutes dropping below horizon then returning 15-20 degrees from orignal location. This was in early spring of 1992 or 1993.  I noticed what I believed to be flashlights in a field directly south of the house I was in.  Activity after dark was not common this time of the year so I went outside to check it out. I quickly realized the lights were not flash lights at all.  The Lights appeared to be multy colored orbs or balls of light that changed color rapidly.  I would say the flashing or color changning was similar to when one is star gazing and the stars seem to flicker in wavelength.  They were brighter and more clear than any light I have seen at that distance. The LITS were SE of my location and moved to the E before the event was over.  The is a local airport approx. 1 mile S of the house.  I tried to rationalize what I was seeing as Chopper's from the airport, but the LITS ducked below and then would reappear randomly and differnt locations.  The wind was not notably strong, but even on windy night I can hear all manner of traffic at the airport.  That night I heard nothing.  The Lights, there had to have at least seven, were continually dropping below the horizon then returning to maybe 10 degrees above the horizon.  The were not connected to each other in any way i.e. moved seprately.  They were moving to quickly verticly and horizontally to be winged aircraft and sometimes would hover in one position.  I observed the craft for 2-3 minutes when I decided to find a witness.  I literally dragged my younger brother out into the back yard to watch.  He saw the same thing I did, but with fewer craft, maybe three.  One craft stayed in a hover the other went below the horizon for a final time.  The one that was hovering by itself flew almost exactly east to west flying directly over our heads.  It was had gained a lot of altitude in a short period and was probably @ or above 10,000 ft.  The lone LITS went from hovering above the eastern horizon to below the houses in about 10-15 seconds.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Out-of-place star moved like nothing I've ever seen;2001-09-10 23:00:00;A few seconds;Out-of-place star moved like nothing I've ever seen I was smoking outside on my deck, looking at the stars like I usually do.  I noticed a rather large, bright star which looked out of place with the rest of the stars.  It made no noise and just sat there for a few seconds.  Instantly, it bolted up, which had to have been hundreds or thousands of feet considering the distance it was from me, then bolted to the right and disappeared in the blink of an eye.  I consider myself a very logical person and a hardcore skeptic, but this was extrememly odd.  There was no way it was a meteor entering our atmosphere because of the angles in which it moved.  Falling stars don't sit still, then all of a sudden fly north, then just that quickly, fly west, then disappear. It was not a plane or aircraft that could be operated by humans because at the speed this thing moved, they'd be killed by the G Forces. I have no idea what this was and probably never will...and that bothers me. Big D. Kansas City, Missouri;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Bright objects in NE Sky;2002-09-25 10:00:00;40 seconds;Bright objects in NE Sky In the Northeast Sky, Southeast of KC Mo. Two large (size of a bright star) moving together towards the Northeast.  Became one bright bright light.  Saw commercial aircraft fly under the formation (commerial craft was at cruising alt). Object seperated and continued for about 20 seconds before dimming.  Objects was much larger then commercial craft Weird… ((NUFORC Note:  Date may approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Two faint lights in the daytime sky.;2005-04-02 15:30:00;5-10 minutes;Two faint lights in the daytime sky. On Saturday afternoon my wife and family and I were in our front yard playing ball with our kids.  My wife noticed what looked like a faint star or ultra-high altitude craft to the northeast at about 70 degrees up from the horizon. She asked me what I thought it was because I am a former US Marine air traffic controler and aircraft buff. It looked like a sattelite as it would be seen moving slowly across the night sky, except it was broad daylight.  I went inside the house and got a low power telescope to get a closer look, but never could locate the object due to the sunlight. The object moved north, turned east, then west in what looked to us like a 3/4 box turn. There it met with a second identical object briefly and they were lost behind a high altitude whispy cloud. They were so faint that they were hard to see, and eventually were simply gone.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Noticed a hovering light in the sky for 50 minutes and was slowly moving to the south.;2011-12-10 22:00:00;1 hour;Noticed a hovering light in the sky for 50 minutes and was slowly moving to the south. I noticed a dot of light in the east from my front room window that I observed for about 50 minutes.  It was odd in that the light was there for such a long time.  I could not determine the distance the dot of light was from me, but when I first noticed it is was about 30 deg. above the horizon and 20 degrees south of east.  Over the 50 minutes I watched it it slowly moved to the south until it was about 50 degrees south of east.  I tried to get a short movie of it, but as I looked at what I captured today, I don't see any image from my camera.  Other info is:  I believe it was a long ways off, maybe a mile. It twinkled.  It looked like white, then green, then blueish light and repeating those colors. I first noticed this at 9:30 PM and watched it until 10:20 PM when I went to bed. There was a small aircraft that was going approx. due south that was east of me by a half mile and they might have seen what I saw if they looked to their left.  That aircraft flew by around 9:50, but I did not note the exact time.  The airport near here may know about that small plane. If I were to guess what it was I would say it was a helicopter hoovering high in the sky.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
They were 2-3 that came at separate times about 3-5 minutes apart. They were bright red then changed to orange/yellow. One of the orbs;2013-07-04 23:00:00;0-15 minutes;They were 2-3 that came at separate times about 3-5 minutes apart. They were bright red then changed to orange/yellow.  One of the orbs was 45 to 55 feet and above my neighbors tree and dove directly down in the trees.  There were fireworks going off, but fireworks do explode as soon as they are ignited.  Then there was about 2 on the left side of my house above my neighbors house at least 100 feet.  One of the orbs were bright red and just keep going straight up and then it made a 90 degree direction in less than a minute it was going very fast I would say they were going 5-15 mph.  Then the one orb went above my house and just keep going. July 4th, 2013 was the day where the most UFO activity took place, but there has been just only one orange orb that been going on since June 31. It was above our church on M-150 about 80 feet and decided to show it's capabilitys by disappearing and repairing 50 yards to the left within less than a second.  Then reappeared  just! a sec later in 20-30 yards under where it originally started.  Whitemans airbase is 50 miles from here.   They were not Chinese sky latterns because there was no wind. Chinese sky latterns perform those capabilitys unless directed with wind.  PLANES cannot perform that low unless they were directed to. They were Orange/yellow and red/orange.

Witnessed ball of light in the distance start from ground level fire across the sky at 45 degree angle and disappear.;2016-05-11 07:00:00;1 second;5/11/16 7 AM Lee’s Summit, MO State Highway 291 - Thunderstorms in the area, lighting and rain.  Witnessed ball of light in the distance start from ground level fire across the sky at 45 degree angle and disappear.  I have seen an object in the distance before on a clear day in the same area that appeared to be hovering, then disappear.  Thought it was a sun spot, but now I don’t know..  Very weird.
