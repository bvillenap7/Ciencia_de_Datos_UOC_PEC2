Large dull brown triangle/boomerage shape. Just happened to be looking up and laying back, looking up to the east on Thanksgiving day evening.  Clear nite, good visibility, constellation Orion clearly visible in ese sky.  There generalized ground light pollution in this urban area but it seemed to illumate the object from underneath.  There were no lights.   Just a huge brown triangle/boomerang type of shape moving low and silently towards the east (can't say it was due east at this time, i am not there now).  The object appeared almost organic- brown with what best could be described as a morphing web pattern throughout.  We just sd wow, what the hell was that?  I have been told that it was probably a stealth fighther going back to Whiteman AFB (MO).  If it was, it was much much larger than any stealth i have seen.   Approx length/width would have to be 8-10 city blocks.  Later in a different city (Jefferson City, MO) a similar silent event took place, but I cannot remember the exact date at this time.
