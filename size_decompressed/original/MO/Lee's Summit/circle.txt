First one past the night hourzon in about 45 secounds and the secound one was brighter until 3/4 way across the night horizon and turned up i'm guessing until it was out of sight.  The glow just got smaller and was out of sight in no time.  Each sighting was about 30 seconds apart and duration was only 30 to 45 secounds each.   Thought you would like to know,   First ufo sighting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Large, bright light, moving slowly then zipping away.;2012-10-29 20:25:00;2-3 minutes;Large, bright light, moving slowly then zipping away. October 29, 2012 Tonight (Oct.29) about 8:25 p.m., looking to the west, just above the trees, saw a dim star when a  bright, white light (LED brightness)  appeared on the north side of it.   It was going southeast, called my sons to look.   Saw my neighbor (a Marine) outside, asked if he knew what it could be, no.  It continued going southeast, slowly, then it just zipped out of sight.  Appeared to disappear upwards, not  lateral.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
Solid white light.;2014-08-30 05:30:00;30 minutes;Solid white light. I woke up around 5:30am, looked out my window.  In the ESE, I saw a very bright white light with flashes of green and red.  I thought it was a jet until it started moving in very erratic movements (circles, very jerking motion).   I got my binoculars, it looked like a circle with four lights (like a flashlight beam) coming out the top and sides.  I watched until it went behind some trees, about half an hour.;38.9208608695654;-94.3449786749477
