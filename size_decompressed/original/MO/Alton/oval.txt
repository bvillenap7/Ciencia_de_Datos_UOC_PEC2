The object was about 40 degrees above tho horizon...and the location would be in he Northwestern sky. In relation- I had been looking at the big dipper and commented that it was standing on it's handle.....looking from that constellation's higherst star, moved my eyes straight across the sky to the left about 75 degrees.  My husband saw it first and remarked about seeing an odd light.  I saw nothing, and then it appeared.  It was more shaped like an eye, inside were maybe 3 different round lights, all orange/yellowish color.  The object was stationary.  Then the lights went out.  After almost 30 seconds, they appeared again, and stayed on about 20 seconds, and went out.  This happened twice, although the length of time the lights shined was not consistant.  We have been traveling this same road for twenty years and never seen any lights like this.  There are no towers in the area, and it is very rural.  For a size comparison...this object was about ten times larger than the biggest star visable with the naked eye.;36.693;-91.3929
