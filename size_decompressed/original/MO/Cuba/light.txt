BRIGHT Bluish-white light moving silently through sky at very high speed;2008-05-21 22:00:00;31-45 Sec;BRIGHT Bluish-white light moving silently through sky at very high speed We saw a light moving through the sky at a very high speed, and there was no sound from it, and no flashing lights, either.  I don't know of any plane that has a bright light shining down at all times, but maybe I'm wrong.  It was a very bright light, and almost looked like a shooting star, but was much brighter and it kept going through the sky until we couldn't see it anymore. It was very clear last night, and you could see no trail whatsoever, and it was silent.  It almost had the characteristics of a comet, but the light was more of a bluish white. I really can't know for sure what it was, but I have watched the stars avidly since I was a child and I have never seen anything like this.;38.0913;-91.4078
Light appearing in the sky.;2017-11-05 20:00:00;2 minutes;Light appearing in the sky This is the 4th time I have seen a light appear in this exact same area.  A bright light suddenly appears, stays there for a few min then vanishes from sight.  It has appeared at the same time, in the same spot 4 different times.   The light stays in the sky for a few min and then vanishes.  The object was a light yellow color and almost had a glow about it.  It was at least 10 times bigger than a star in the sky.;38.0913;-91.4078
