Six strange lights in the sky.;2003-09-23 21:30:00;10 Seconds;Six strange lights in the sky. My mother and I were watching tv when my mom said to me What is that? I looked over and saw out my window what looked to be fireballs in the sky. They each lit up one at a time. There were a total of five going horizontally. They stayed there for about five seconds. We ran out to my back porch to see if we could see what it was but it was gone. Then we saw another, what looked to be a fireball, light up again and then disappeared. When i got to work the next day, i told my story to some co-workers then i found out that two other people that i work with saw the same thing. I have no idea what i was seeing that night. The police were called to find out if anyone reported stranged lights in the sky, but no one placed a report.;38.0913;-91.4078
