small yellow-white light seen in De Soto , MO;2008-10-24 10:12:00;5-6 min;small yellow-white light seen in De Soto , MO It was the 24th of October and my friend and I just got done playing a video game. As we were getting ready to head to bed I noticed a small light slightly above the horizon. I pointed it out to my friend to make sure I was not seeing things, as I had seen this light before but a different color and slightly more to the right.   He saw it too we both stopped and watched it for several minutes.  We turned out all the lights and TV to make sure it wasn’t a reflection, and since I live 13+ miles from town and 2 miles from the nearest person, I knew it wasn’t that.  About 4 minutes in we saw the light slowly move back and forth in a half circle motion. We both realized that we were seeing what we were seeing and freaked out and went into another room to see if our buddy who was sleeping would see it. We woke him up and took him in to the room to see if he could see it but the light was gone. This was not the first time this object was seen. I (the one writing this) have seen it outside my house in a field across from my window.  The only thing different is it looked like it was a yellow-blue light when my friend saw it,  but white-yellow when I saw it (about 4 days earlier and 13-14 days before that one).  This may sound like a lot of BS but its not and my friend and I would like to know if anyone has seen anything like it in my area (De Soto, Missouri). This is the my first time my friend and I have seen that we cannot explain in any way;38.1215000000001;-90.5529999999999
Red-orange lights floating in random formation before fading out;2014-05-17 21:00:00;5-6 minutes;Red-orange lights floating in random formation before fading out On a clear night, with no planes in a rural location, we saw what started as 4 red-orange, somewhat flickering lights moving in a random formation through the southeast sky.  As we watched them moving, some began to move more quickly and in direct paths.  After a few moments, a few more came up from the horizon.  They lasted about 5-6 minutes before fading out.  They varied slightly in brightness. They were completely silent. The formation seemed like something directly out of a classic ufo sighting tv show, and this being such a rural area, the only other thing we could imagine they could be were chinese lanterns, or other flame driven balloons.  They arced up a bit as they traveled, and we observed that they were arcing with the prevailing winds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
