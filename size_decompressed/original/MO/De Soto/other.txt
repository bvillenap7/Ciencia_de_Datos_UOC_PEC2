Straight line of red lights.;2017-12-09 20:30:00;10 minutes;Looking out towards the southwest sky outside of DeSoto, Missouri, we saw a PERFECTLY straight line of red lights.  Approximately 25-30 lights all were blinking and all were red.  No sound was heard from the UFO.  You could see a very slow movement (but not as fast as any plane) moving towards the WNW.   We watched it for approximately 10 mintues before it started to get behind the tree line over the horizon.;38.1215000000001;-90.5529999999999
