It was over De Soto Missouri on 7/13/2005 around 9:55 PM.  Two pinpoints of lights beneath a mostly cloudy night sky.  Several stars were visible.  The lights seemed to be below or just beneath the clouds, yet they appeared to be somewhat the same size pinpoints of light as the other stars visible in the sky.  I would guess around 20,000 feet.  When I first noticed the lights, they were engaging in a high speed circular chase.  The circle was proportional to a small diameter circle about the size of a quarter held at arms length.  They were moving at about 180 revolutions per minute for approximately 1 or 2 seconds before they split and went in the exact opposite directions.  I believe, near South and near North.  The Southerly light appeared to move away from the circle slower than the Northerly light.  Both lights never did disappear from my view for at least 5 minutes.
