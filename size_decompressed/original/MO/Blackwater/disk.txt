My hobby is my telescope.  After I start the car I look up to see what planets are where.  On this particular morning I saw what appeared to be two saturns until one started moving.  I watched for a second, then ran in the house to get my wife and my daughter to see what I was seeing.  I then ran in to get the digital camera.  It appeared to be a bright light that flickered.  It was flying north in a wavering line. My wife went in to finish getting ready for work and I went around the house to get more pictures.  The object went behind the clouds and blinked three red lights then three white lights.  After leaving for work at around 4:55 I saw a plane flying from east to west.;38.9742;-92.9638
