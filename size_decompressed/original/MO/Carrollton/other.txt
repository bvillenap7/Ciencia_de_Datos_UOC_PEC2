new aircraft in super quiet and slow mode.;2006-11-30 23:00:00;2,min.;new aircraft in super quiet and slow mode. I was driving north on 65 highway and just cross the missouri river bridge and to the west spotted a object with a large amount of lights flashing on it. This was not a lifechopper, but 4xs as large with a flying ceiling of 300 ft.  It cross over my suv at about 30 miles per hour and I had my window down and this craft had no sound or vibs.   I noticed that when they cross the missouri river, they was flying at a lower ceiling and just hugging the bluffs on the south side of the river. This could have been a new type of craft flying out of whiteman afb 20 miles to the south.;39.3736;-93.4923
