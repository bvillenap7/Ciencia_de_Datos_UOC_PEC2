Large, brown/rust triangular object seen descending slowly before fading away;2008-05-23 01:04:00;12 Seconds;Large, brown/rust triangular object seen descending slowly before fading away Over the western horizon, a large isoceles triangle shaped object was spotted descending slowly, approximately 600-700 ft in the air. The exact size of the object was indeterminate, but it seemed visible through light cloud cover and light pollution over old rt. 66, specifically 7th street Wal-mart. It faded from view before it fell much further, it may have also been moving westward at the time.;37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
V shaped, extreamly fast, silent and the color was orange.;2010-01-11 21:30:00;5 to 10 sec.;V shaped, extreamly fast, silent and the color was orange. at about 10 to 15 thousand feet flying west to east what first appeared to be a formation of jets. Then what first appeared to be separate aircraft looked more like one aircraft with 6 pods in a V shape and the color was orange. The speed was way faster than I have seen any plane go and there was no sound at all. My entire life I have never witnessed anything like this. I was always some what of a skeptic until tonight.;37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
Triangle-shaped craft 4 lights.;2010-03-30 21:25:00;About 2 Minutes;Triangle-shaped craft 4 lights. I live on the 4th floor of a new apartment complex on the east edge of town. The light pollution isn’t too awful so I am able to enjoy (simple) stargazing without going out into the country. Tonight I was on my balcony viewing the Moon through my binoculars and noticed what I thought to be a low flying plane coming from the south. My balcony faces the southeast. I focused my binoculars on it and noticed there were no flashing strobe lights that I’ve seen on other aircraft. Because the Moon is so bright tonight, and as the craft moved toward the north and nearly overhead, I was able to make out a triangle shape. It had, at first, 3 lights underneath on each corner.  As it came closer, I noticed a fainter light in the center (underneath) of the craft. The lights were white. It was flying north. No sound.;37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
We saw a triangular object with lights on each corner that hovered in one spot for 25 minutes over our city and videotaped it.;2017-12-15 20:00:00;25 minutes;We saw a triangular object with lights on each corner that hovered in one spot for 25 minutes over our city and videotaped it. My significant other and our three sons were returning home when all of us saw a strange light that was hovering in one spot in the sky.  The light would change shapes and brightness.  It formed into a triangular shape, and we could see that it had one light on each of the corner angles.   We videotaped it for quite a while. Part of the video is blurry, but you can clearly see the triangle shape in part of the video.   I have two post-graduate degrees and am self-employed.  My boyfriend spent a decade working for the city.  My son is 15 and is in high school, and the other two boys are 10 and 7.  All of us saw the object, and we stayed out there as long as we could stand it because it was very cold.;37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
