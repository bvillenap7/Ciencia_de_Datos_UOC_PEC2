Small, stationary, reddish-orange, star-like object disappears.;2006-03-10 20:00:00;3 - 5 seconds;Small, stationary, reddish-orange, star-like object disappears. My wife and I were driving south on Florida street in town. I like to try to spot planets and various stars. I was looking eastward and I saw what looked like a reddish-orange star. I thought maybe it was Mars, but after a few seconds it disappeared. The moon was full and I could see that there were no clouds in the area.  There were some trees but they never blocked my view. I kept looking around thinking maybe it was a light on a tower but I never saw it again. I only think that it could be a UFO. I am not sure, but it was really odd. Starry Night Pro shows that Mars was more to the west of where I saw this object. Anyway, planets and stars donâ€™t just stop shinning like that.

About 3 weeks prior to this sighting we were driving home from work and we saw this redish orange light moving across the sky at night. Ot was moving faster than a plane didn't have the flashing lights like a plane does either. These things are just unexplainable.;37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
