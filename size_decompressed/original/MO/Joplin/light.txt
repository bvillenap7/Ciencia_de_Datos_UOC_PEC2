Two bright lights turn into 20 to 30 planes!;2006-10-02 20:02:00;7 min;Two bright lights turn into 20 to 30 planes! There was a really bright light in the sky that was like two stars real close to the ground they stayed station for the duration about 7 minutes.  Then the lights started moving apart and then ONE light turned around a big flame came out the back of one of the bright lights the light went out and then started flashing like a airplane ,but the first object that I think was the ufo[there were no flashing lights] left the jet behind.  About 10 to 15 minutes after sighting we had about 20 to 30 planes flying in the same direction that the ufo went.  The planes just keep coming over my house.;37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP REPORT:   I looked up in the sky and saw what I thought was a satellite.;2007-06-15 22:30:00;5 minutes;MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP:  UFOMIG@yahoo.com  http://ufomig.yolasite.com  I had just locked up my car and was walking back to the house when I looked up in the sky and saw what I thought was a satellite.  Then I noticed a smaller light flying on the same trajectory in front of the first light.  I thought it was cool to see two satellites at once.  At the time I didn't really think anything was any more extraordinary than that except for the fact that these two lights were traveling from south/east to north/west and any satellites I've ever witnessed always traveled from south to north.  So I watched them until they became faint in the horizon then I looked overhead again and saw two more lights moving along the same flight plane as the first two but these two lights were very close together and were not moving in a straight line like the first two.  They seemed to be playing with each other, dancing around each other, and they were slightly larger than the first two.  They glowed a bit like the cherry of a cigarette, only a bit more pale.  I watched them! until they grew faint in the sky, then I looked back to where they had come from in the sky and I saw a line of these same lights moving across the sky.  I think there must have been about 25 to 30 of these lights together, very tightly spaced.  I watched for a second and then realizing that what I was seeing had to be UFO's I ran into the house to get my son.  He didn't seem to be as excited about it as I was but we stood and watched until they faded into the horizon. The line of lights behaved like the second set of lights that I saw. There were smaller and larger lights and they all seemed to be moving around each other.  I don't know much about how ball lighting behaves but if ball lightning doesn't move in basically a straight line like a formation then I don't know what these things were that I saw.  I know it wasn't any kind of aircraft or balloons, or meteors or comets or anything else that could be explained. I have never seen a UFO before but I truly believe I have no! w because I can't explain! n what I saw.

Orange ball moving above Joplin, MO;2011-07-09 22:45:00;1-2 minutes;Orange ball moving above Joplin, MO Orange ball/light moving above Joplin, MO. My husband first noticed it - described it as an orange looking lemon shaped object coming from the southwest.  He ran inside to tell me to come out and look at it.   We watched it move pretty quickly toward the northwest and eventually disappear behind the tree lines.  It was definitely bright orange, but it's hard to pin point an exact shape.   When I first walked outside it was very large - almost like something was on fire in the sky...by the time it disappeared it was a very faint dot. We did not observe any sound, other associated lights, etc.  Just the one orange light/object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Tiny lights.;2013-07-06 23:00:00;10 minutes;Tiny lights. There was at least 50 tiny lights traveling north in the sky, some disappeared as they went by.  As they were going north a helicopter flew south above them.  There's nothing in the news in regard to it.;37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
I noticed a bright light. I then noticed a second then a third. They were flying in a straight line.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 20:45:00;10 minutes;I was standing outside smoking when I noticed a bright light.  I then noticed a second then a third.  They were flying in a straight line.  Then a group of another three lughts appeared following same flight path.  This happened two more times then a group of scattered lights at the back.  I was unable to film lights with my phone the camera would not pick up the lights.;37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
