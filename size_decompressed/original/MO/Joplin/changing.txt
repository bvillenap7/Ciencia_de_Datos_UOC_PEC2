disc shape with faces in middle, bright light changing into different shapes;2004-05-06 21:00:00;2 hrs;disc shape with faces in middle, bright light changing into different shapes As soon as I step out my back door to the west and look up above the tree line there appears a bright white light. My friend said it followed her home the first night. Then the next I recorded it. It first looks like a bright halogen bulb then it starts changing into the most weird shapes it goes to a round disc with a hole in the middle that seems to pulsate. It is a pink color then it suddenly changes into a white fireball that flickers and moves. Also it changes into a blue fireball with different color outlining it. While the object is round with the eye inside the pink it shows different faces. The object moves down ward and disappears after around 11:30 pm. It is in the same place every night I have seen it. I have 90 mintues of video of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus sighting, we suspect.  PD));37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
