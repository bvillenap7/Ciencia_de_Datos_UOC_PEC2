Grey cigar-shape, w/ short Chem Trail traveling at high rate of speed northbound over Carl Junction/Joplin Mo area.;2016-01-12 17:30:00;30 minutes;Grey Cigar shape with short Chem Trail traveling at high rate of speed northbound over Carl Junction/Joplin Mo area. I noticed what looked like a chem trail traveling north as I was entering Joplin heading West on 7th street from Carthage, Mo.  It was over the Carl Junction area, as I watched it I noticed that 1/3 of the total length of the Chem trail looked like a solid Grey Cigar shaped object.  For reference in size it appeared to be a few inches in length while I viewed it in my windsheild, and 1/3 of this was what appeared to be solid grey matter.  The grey matter looked far larger than any aircraft that I would expect to see.  The object and trail moved from directly ahead of me over 7th street very far in the distance when I crossed highway 249, to out my passenger window far off in the distance by the time I reached Rangeline road in Joplin Mo. This really seemed very fast.  Also noted there was a man made aircraft south of this object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
