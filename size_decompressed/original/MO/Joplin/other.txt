Observation of 50+ mechanical devices in sky.;2004-07-31 18:15:00;20 min;Observation of 50+ mechanical devices in sky. During my daughter's 14th birthday party, my wife (36), kids (14,9,5), mother (73) and friends were outside when my wife came in to ask me to go out and tell her what something was.  My 9 year old son had spotted some white spots in the sky.  When I first saw the spots, they were very small and I only saw two or three.  They looked to be at a very high altitude.  As I scanned the sky, I saw at least 50 of the spots overhead.  I ran in to get some binoculars and then observed them at a low magnification:  they appeared to have white mushrooms on the top and bottom, connected by a dark cylinder and the mushrooms were spinning.  They were not in a recognizable formation, but seemed to be equdistance from each other, randomly scattered. As they moved from east to west, they were obscured by some very high, wispy clouds.  After all were no longer visible, there was one larger (or lower altitude) device that seemed to move away, then it too disapeared from sight.  The local police had no reports of this and the local news station is investigating.  I am 37 and an Engineering Technician with a consulting engineering firm designing electrical substations, with degrees in CADD and Management and am currently in an MBA program.  My mother is 73 and a licensed counselor.  My wife is a homemaker and is 36.  My daughter is a 14 year old 8th grade student, my sons 9 and 5 are entering 4th grade and kindergarten.  Other observers were a 10 year old girl and her mother and possibly others at the party.;37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
