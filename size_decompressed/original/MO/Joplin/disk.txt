Saucer with lights within yards of us at a truck stop at Oklahoma state line for 15 minutes. In June 1987.;1987-06-10 22:30:00;15 min.;Saucer with lights within yards of us at a truck stop at Oklahoma state line for 15 minutes. In June 1987. We were traveling west on I44 and stopped at the state line truck stop where Missouri and Oklahoma meet. Up in the air about 200 to 300 feet. was a large disk shaped object with large round yellow/orange lights spaced all around the perimeter that we could see. It was so large that we could not see the lights around the back side. It was huge. It dwarfed the size of a high school track and football field complex. We stood almost right under it. The people there getting gas and the clerk inside told us that they see these large craft quite often and they said that the craft were US equipment and that it is no big deal. We watched it move from it's stationary position upward for quite a ways up. Then it tilted upward to our right and flew away very fast and out of sight in seconds. The craft made no sound and no exhaust seemed present to us. It was so great to just stand and watch. It moved faster than any thing I have ever seen and it was larger than any aircraft I have ever seen in a museum or other wise.

Bright disk cutting through TV tornado film, seen 06/14/11.;2011-05-28 13:00:00;5 sec;05/28/11     Joplin     MO     disk     3-5 seconds     bright disk cutting through TV tornado film          06/14/11 While watching a popular cable weather program a week ago,which was describing the wild weather of the previous week, I noticed during some tornado footage, a bright white or silver disk cutting across left-to-right through the top of a spinning tornado or just above it.  It was quite clear-cut that this object was not part of the spinning debris around the tornado.  It lasted 3-5 seconds and was completely gone.  Telling from the footage, it may have occurred sometime during the recent severe weather outbreak over Joplin Missouri during the afternoon of possibly May 28th.   No mention whatsoever, was made of the object during this footage. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
Flying saucer flying 4-5,000 MPH in a S formation East over Joplin, Missouri.;2014-08-26 22:01:00;8 seconds;Flying saucer flying 4-5,000 MPH in a &quotS&quot formation East over Joplin, Missouri. The flying saucer was moving at speeds I estimate of over 4,000 miles per hour.  I compared it to a plane flying by.  The saucer was turning really fast and went over head and East in a S formation until it went out of site.   Absolutely mind blowing how fast and how easy it made turns.;37.0717455445544;-94.5070287128714
