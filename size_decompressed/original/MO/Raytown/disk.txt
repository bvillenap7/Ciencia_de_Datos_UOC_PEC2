It appeared in a very populated area[in town], it seemed to make no noise and approached the back side of my parents property stopping at tree top level. I ran inside the house and phoned Richard Gabaur airforce base and made report, then called the Raytown Mo. police dept.  After I went back to the back yard it moved almost unbeliveably quick, straight up and then disappeared almost instantly. I also got on the C-B radio and spoke with many, many people in the immediate area that wittnessed the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.0097;-94.4658
