Bright orange lights in sky over Mtn Grove Mo.;2006-01-19 19:45:00;15 min.;Bright orange lights in sky over Mtn Grove Mo. I was coming home from work when I saw two large orange colored balls of light in the sky. I was on my cellphone talking to a friend who only lives five miles north of me. I told him and he ran outside his house and started looking up in the sky towards the north. What we both saw then is so far unexplainable. We both watched as the two objects would jump,bounce,and dart back and forth from each other. Then as suddenly as they apeared they were gone seconds later they reapeared movieng very quickly towards the north west. We also saw more lights appear and disapear in the same manner all together we saw as many as eight in a perfect row at one time. Now I have seen plenty of airplanes at night and I know these were no planes or for that matter weather ballons. So what were they?;37.1595;-92.2806
