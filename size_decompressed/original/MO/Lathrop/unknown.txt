((anonymous report));2016-09-27 01:45:00;5 seconds;Bright light was stationary in the sky and then took off at an incredible speed before it disappeared completely. We were driving home and saw what appeared to be an airplane at first glance, but was just a ball of white light that wasn't moving.  My husband and I were looking at it when it took off at an incredible speed and disappeared.  It wasn't close enough to tell what size or shape it was.
