White disappearing ball of fire reappeared and then turned black.;2016-07-08 21:30:00;10 minutes;White disappearing ball of fire reappeared and then turned black. Orange/yellow light, at first I thought it was a star, then maybe an airplane, but it appeared as though it was not moving.  It then started to look like it was getting smaller, so I assumed it was moving away from me, and then it disappeared.  Then, I passed by some trees and saw it again this time, it looked like a white ball that was on fire the fire was at the bottom of the object.  I thought it might be a lantern-style firecracker, but it was too high to be any kind of firecracker.  It disappeared again, and when it reappeared, it was black then, it seemed to be near the horizon and fell.   After I witnessed this, I called my sister to tell her about it and my phone made a static sound it had never made before, then all went quiet, then my call was dropped.   When I was trying to call her back, I was going to turn off my phone, and instead just the screen turned off and then came back on and my YouTube app started up without being touched.;39.5223;-94.3088
