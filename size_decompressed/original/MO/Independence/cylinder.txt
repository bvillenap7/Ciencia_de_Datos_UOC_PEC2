Huge UFO with brilliant lights flying low over Kansas City, Missouri;2020-02-06 19:45:00;30 seconds;Huge UFO with brilliant lights flying low over Kansas City, Missouri Did anyone else see this?  I went out for a few minutes last night at 7:45 pm and noticed a huge craft west of my position at 23rd Sreet and Noland Road in Independence. This location is on top of a big hill. It looked like it was only a mile away and larger than a 747. There were brilliant white lights all over it and one red light on the left side. The lights were reflecting off of shiny metal. At first, I thought it was a plane landing at the Downtown Kansas City airport, and it would have needed to turn in order to do so, but soon realized that it was flying very low - at approximately 2,000 feet or lower and slow-moving from North to South. It did not turn in the direction (west) it would have needed to land. The object then either disappeared or turned all of its lights out. I immediately called another investigator and she had just seen the same object in the western skies from her position, which is two miles closer to where the object was. So that m! eans it had to have been approximately three miles away, making it absolutely huge - perhaps five times the size of a commercial airliner. The skies were clear last night. I am hoping that someone else saw this object and got video of it.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
