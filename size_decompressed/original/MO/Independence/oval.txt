Three  times the size of  a normal  NGB-2  bomber.;2016-05-01 01:00:00;2-3 minutes;Three  times the size of  a normal  NGB-2  bomber. I, as  well  as  many of my neighbors,  have seen  triangle shaped planes  for many years.  Whiteman AFB is just  South East from where we live so we  know  that  these triangle shaped  craft  are  F-117  fighters  or  NGB-2  bombers. I  could not sleep  on the night  of  5/1/2016  so  went  out to have  a smoke, around  1 AM. I  saw what  I  though  was  going  to be  a NGB-2 bomber  approaching  from the northwest, heading southwest  to  Whiteman  AFB. As it  got  closer,  I  could  tell  it  was  gliding at  tree top level,  which is unusally  low.  It  was  approximately  three  times  as large  as  the normal  NGB-2. No noise,  2  red  lights  at  each  end  of the its  wings. So either  Whitman has  a new  version of the  NGB-2 or something is  checking  them out.
