Came home from a Royals game. Husband putting car in garage. Stopped to look at stars.  Movement caught my attention.  Moving from SW to NE, I I noticed (I am assuming), a single object, the shape of which was a chevron and formed by golden lights.  The lights were bright at the leading edge and decreased in intensity as they went toward the rear, with the midsection being totally dark. The sky was perfectly clear. I could not tell if I was looking at a solid stucture or the sky through the lights.  I thought I heard a very faint hum, like an electrical transformer, but I cant be sure. ............... ................... ...                   ... ....                     .... Sort of looked like this, but several hundred lights, and the midsection dark. There is no way to tell how high it was, but I got the impression it was lower than a conventional aircraft would be over a populated area. It measure approximately 3 or so inches at arms length. I see there is another report from Independence.  Id like to talk to whoever made it.  I will e-mail Mr. Davenport and give permission to pass on my e-mail address.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
UFO with black exhaust sighted in Independence, MO Oct. 11, 2003;2003-10-11 22:40:00;10 minutes;UFO with black exhaust sighted in Independence, MO Oct. 11, 2003 The night sky was overcast with an odd low greenish haze/fog with the full bright moon shining through it evenly all over the sky.  It was bright enough to be able to see well enough to walk without a flashlight.  It was not raining and the temperature was cool. I noticed an uneven break in the clouds at about 75 degrees from the horizon and pointed it out to my brother and daughter who were with me.  We noted that there was a very dark black cloud right behind this light area, and no other dark clouds in the sky.  The object moved from South to North very slowly but the bright light did not change shape, so I began to suspect that we were not looking at a break in the clouds at all, but rather a craft of some sort with a round half moon shape with fog concealing it.  The black cloud did change shape constantly and looked like some type of exhaust, but it stayed right behind the bright object.  At one point, I could see stars behind both the black and white areas at the same time.  It was very large - the size of a lunch plate held at arm's length. No sound was heard by any of us. We watched it for about 10 minutes until it dissapeared from sight.  It is hard to explain, but I felt that it was a very large craft that might have been transparent with a black exhaust coming from it.  I would be very interested in finding out if anyone else saw this. It is interesting to note that I drove my brother home right after this incident and after only 10 minutes we saw that the entire sky was free of any fog,haze or clouds, and the full moon was out.  I wonder if the UFO caused the fog in order to conceal itself. I have no photos as I knew they would not come out, but I could do a drawing of it if desired.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
Fleet of 30-50 extremely high altitude flying Y-wing aircraft/spacecraft reflecting in the sun as pinpoint blue flashes of light.;2019-03-16 16:40:00;5 minutes;Fleet of 30-50 extremely high altitude flying Y-wing aircraft/spacecraft reflecting in the sun as pinpoint blue flashes of light. Today, March 16, 2019, at approximately 4:40pm cst, a fleet of between 30 and 50 extremely high altitude Y wing aircraft/spacecraft, was spotted heading east above Independence, MO.   Was looking right up where they were flying over, but would have never even seen them had the sun not gleaned off of them at the perfect angle, reflecting mostly blue flashes of light.  They had no trails, were shaped like a skinny Y and seemed to be able to maneuver sideways and even stop in place.  I honestly thought we were being invaded.  I ((one word deleted)) u not.   Either I just saw us moving a LARGE fleet of secret space force vehicles or the alien ship armada has arrived.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
