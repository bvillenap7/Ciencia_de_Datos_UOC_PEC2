ASD Missouri MUFON reporting for witness re:  1969 UFO over Lake City Army Ammunition Plant for Two Hours;1969-08-01 03:00:00;2 hours;ASD MIssouri MUFON reporting for witness re:1969 UFO over Lake City Army Ammunition Plant for Two Hours 1969 UFO sighting at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant Reported in June, 2014 to ASD of Missouri MUFON  I received a call from the witness regarding his sighing of a large UFO over Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in 1969.  The witness, who was told to keep quiet about the event, recently decided to come forward in order to let the public know that an unidentified object hovered and moved about the plant for two hours in the middle of the night and was witnessed by at least 13 people. The primary witness, age 22 at the time, was living in Independence, Missouri and working as a civilian contractor at Lake City.  Lake City Army Ammunition Plant is a 3,935-acre U.S. government owned, contractor-operated facility located in eastern Independence near 7 Highway and 28 Highway.  The plant manufactures ammunition for the military for the U.S. Army.  In addition, Lake City performs small caliber ammunition stockpile reliability testing and has ammunition and weapon testing responsibilities as the NATO National and Regional Test Center. The witness worked the night shift from midnight to eight O’clock A.M. in the printing shop.  On a hot August night in 1969 the electricity for the entire plant and all buildings suddenly went out, so the crew of seven in his department went outside to cool down.  That is when they noticed a UFO. A bright chrome spherical object hovered just over a building which was located four buildings away from the men’s position.  The object was so bright it was blinding.  The object then slowly moved over another building across the road and hovered, then continued to zig-zag back and forth across the road from building to building for approximately two hours.  The seven men on the crew with the witness talked amongst themselves while watching the UFO.  At the same time, several jeeps with MP’s were driving to and from the area very quickly, which is something the men had never witnessed before. From their vantage point on the dock they could not see other people on the property at other buildings, but believe that everyone working there must have been outside since there were no fans running and the temperature was over 100 degrees that night. The unidentified object then left the area by shooting up into the sky at a 30 degree angle at an incredible speed. Raymond said that it was gone in ½ of a second, and that solidified the fact that the men were looking at a real UFO and not a military craft of any type. Just as the UFO exited, the electricity came back on. The next morning, two men arrived at the office that no one working there had seen before. One was dressed in a gray suit and the other in black.  One of the men said to everyone “Remember that you have all signed a security clearance and you did not see anything.”  The men then turned and left.  They did not introduce themselves or show any identification.  The message was clear, and the witness kept his mouth shut for 45 years.  But after seeing an episode of Hangar 1 in which Missouri and the Kansas City area were featured as a UFO Hot Spot he decided to come forward with the story.

Brilliant blue light blinded me, then flew away very quickly.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by experienced investigator.  PD));2019-06-20 22:00:00;30 seconds;Brilliant blue light or object blinded me, then flew away very quickly I was closing a shade in my kitchen at 10:00 pm, when I noticed a brilliant blue object, or light, apparently sitting right on top of a streetlight located approximately 75 feet from my house.  It was a little smaller than a basketball and was a bright medium blue color that cast light around it, and it had a white aura around it.   I watched this object for approximately 30 seconds while trying to figure out what it was, when it suddenly shot backward (NE) at extremely high speed, leaving a trail behind it, and was out of sight in a second.   Then I walked into the living room and noticed that the TV and all the lights seemed extremely bright.  I had to lower the brightness on the TV just to watch it.  Ever since then all lights seem very bright to me and I have to keep my office lights off and can't look at a computer screen for very long.  I have an appointment with an eye doctor because I'm afraid that my eyesight has been permanently affected.  I find it very odd that there were so many reports of unexplained objects earlier on the same day in Kansas City.   I am a UFO investigator and have received reports of small bright red objects, small transparent objects, and multiple witnesses to the two or three objects that hovered over KC for over six hours on the 20th and on other days that week.  Additionally, I received two reports of giant birds the size of an airplane in Independence and Sugar Creek that were seen on the 20th.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
