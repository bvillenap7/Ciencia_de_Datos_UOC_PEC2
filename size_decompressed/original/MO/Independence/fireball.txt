Couldn't make out the shape.  On fire.  Entering earth's atmosphere.  No bright light coming from it I was pulling out of my driveway and noticed a large, what I thought at the time, weird Volkswagen sized meteor out of the corner of my eye.  It looked like it was entering the earth's atmosphere.  It wasn't going across the sky, because there was no trail.  Almost like it was coming at me.  I could see fire around it but there was like a white blue color under the fire.  Almost like a shield of some sort.  I looked over to tap the person next to me to look at what I was seeing and when I looked back up it was gone.  Disappeared.  Like as soon as it made it through earth's atmosphere it became invisible. It wasn't moving fast like in a meteor/meteorite shower.  And it wasn't bright either.  Also there was no sound coming from it at all.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
