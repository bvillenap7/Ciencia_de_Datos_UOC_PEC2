Huge Black disk over Independece, strange lights, and strange events since sighting.;2008-12-13 11:35:00;1 hour;Huge Black disk over Independece, strange lights, and strange events since sighting. At 11:35 PM I walked my two daughters to their cars outside my house after a party and we stood talking for a few minutes while Rachel got in her car.  Rachel, age 30, saw a very large shooting star to the West, then a brightly lit cloud above the same area to the West of our location at approximately 60 degrees from the horizon.  She pointed to the cloud and followed it heading North.  The full moon was out, the cloud ceiling was low and it was windy.  The scattered clouds were moving very fast. It was easy to see the sky, stars, moon, and clouds. At that point, at approximately 11:40 PM, Maria and I both saw a large black round disk-shaped object that appeared to be on it side (top or bottom facing us).  The size was larger than a dessert plate held at arm's length. It was moving slowly from Southeast to Northwest along the bottom of the cloud ceiling, and moving slower than the clouds, which were clipping along at a fast pace. It was very windy.  The full moon shone brightly and I assume that is the only reason we could see the object.  There were no visible lights on the object. Maria, age 32, saw this at the same time I did, but Rachel did not, even though she was looking in the same area.  After a few seconds, the object changed to a gray color, then just vanished.   I then said outloud  We want to see evidence of any persons not of this world and all of us looked in the same direction where the black object had been and I was pointing.  Right after I said this a shooting star appeared in that same spot.  Then we saw lots of shooting stars all around the sky (probably a meteor shower).  Rachel left for home. Maria got in her Suburban to leave, but I noticed a bunch of tiny twinkling lights above the center of the hood of her vehicle appear for 2 seconds, then they disappeared.  I was looking at this area trying to figure out what the lights were when I noticed a reflection of a rectangular light that came on then blinked off on her hood.  Maria got out of the car and the light appeared again.  I soon figured out that it was blinking on and off every 25 seconds, so we knew it had to be something mechanical.  Being square was odd, though.  So she turned off her car and I turned off all the lights in and outside the house in order to see if we could identify the source of the light.  It continued to blink on and off, being an amber color, white, or blue at different times.  There were two spots close together where the lights appeared.  We could not locate the source. We tried blocking the lights out with our hands, and checked the trees moving in the wind that might be blocking or unblocking lights.  The one light continued to blink off and on at regular intervals of 25 seconds. The only reflection of light on the hood that we could identify was the moon, which was in a different location from the blinking lights.  Then I realized something and said OMG - and Maria finished my sentence with It's something we can't see and it's above us.  I ran inside and grabbed my video camera which I had charged up the night before and it went dead after 3 seconds.  Maria got her Sony digital camera out of the car and video-taped and took photos of the car and in the sky above us. Note: The photos came out very dark and smudgy. I got the night vision monocular out but could see nothing.  I then saw a tiny orb appear inside Maria's vehicle, then disappear.  I fully expected to see a ship hoovering right above us!  We could feel the presence of something. Then, 45 minutes after starting, the lights stopped at approximately 12:35 AM.  Since this date, strange things have been happening around my house and my psychic abiliti! es have improved, almost to the point of being annoying.  I see a golden glow around all living things, and this is rather distracting.  Also see details in energy fields around humans.  Received a vision on the morning of Dec 25 with symbols I did not recognize but later found out that they are the Mayan numbering system. There is more, but I don't have room to put it all down here.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
weird aircraft over independence missouri  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2010-12-20 04:00:00;many hours;weird aircraft over independence missouri My brother in law works at the mall over night and he was the one who noticed it at first. He notices it around 4 a.m. and it has been going on for quite some time, over a hour as of now. When first glance at the weird aircraft it was red. Then it changed colors, it would go from white to green. Then two little white objects flew around it and disappeared into the bigger object. My husband and I also witnessed it and we saw the colors change. We saw that it was moving up and down and from side to side and the lights were pulsating. Unfortunately it is dark outside so we cant tell for sure the actual shape and size and our camera wouldn't pick it up. By the way it changed colors and how it moved it could not have been a satellite or an air plane. We just don't know what it could be.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
Glowing, pulsating, orange orb, silent, low to the ground, shot away at amazing speed;2011-10-05 20:40:00;less than 40 seconds;Glowing, pulsating, orange orb, silent, low to the ground, shot away at amazing speed My boyfriend and I were taking a walk and we were looking up into the sky and saw a bright orange glowing orb. Almost looked like it had a fire under it.  It seemed it kinda ‘pulsed’ . It was too low to the ground to be conventional aircraft and made absolutely no sound.  Before I could even grab my cell to get a picture.  It  shot off to the north and out of site. This happened 10-5-11 at 2040 in Independence Missouri   We were on the road:  R. D. Mize   between the streets Arrowhead Drive and Cochise;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
Bright ball of light East of Independence, Mo.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet?  PD));2015-04-11 10:00:00;1 hour;Bright ball of light East of Independence Mo. I live in independence and was looking west towards KC which this bright star light sphere seemed to be South of KC.  It was brighter than all the stars showing and even brighter than Venus which was to the lower right.  It seemed to have a beam of light shooting out of it like a rotating light house which slowly came down as it was turning.  As the beam of light rotated around and slowly came down to my angle it was slowing in rotation and seemed to stop... pointing at me as if it knew i was looking at it.   It was very far away so i wasn't too concerned.   I had my dogs with me and they started acting excited and it was time to go anyways.  I got home and went in looking through the window and it seemed to have changed position.   I then got onto my computer and looked up an astronomy program and found that it could have been the star Aldebaran which sort of made me feel better but I've never seen a star do this.  I recall something from my childhood which ! makes me feel leery of these type of strange occurrences.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
