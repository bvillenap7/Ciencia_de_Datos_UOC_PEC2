I turned and looked up and was shocked at what I had seen. It was a very bright ball. The best way to describe the size was to extend my arm from my body and open my finger and thumb the size of a Â½ Dollar. I have seen several meteors and shooting stars. This was NNOT one. This ball of light was a very bright blue. It looked like a spark of electricity from a wall outlet. It also illuminated the sky about 1/4 mile around the object as it was traveling. It was also flickering. It happened so quickly, and went out of view across the street behind the neighbors tree. I observerd the sky for about 20 minutes but didnt see anything else. Bright Blue, flickering, rather large, 1 witness, round blue ball, I am 29 years old. I own a computer business in Independence Missouri.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135

My wife saw it first and I looked up just in time to see it streak by. I ran and looked out the west window but saw nothing.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135

First few lights were white followed by green lights with an occasional yellow light and finished with 2 green lights.  Too far apart to belong to one vehicle.  I estimate 5 mile plus or minus separation between lights and maybe they were at airliner altitude.  No falling arc, no sparking like a falling star.  Just lights in the sky moving very fast in a flat plane straight west.  I estimate that due to location in the sky, they would have actually flown over south Kansas City, MO.  Total viewing period was approx. 20 seconds and occurred over a 60 degree field of vision.  Both witnesses were left wondering exactly what we saw.  Viewing took place in a Sam's Club parking lot looking directly south.  Didn't notice anyone else reacting as if they saw it too.  Have seen NO report in the local press, of course!;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135

There was a group oh maybe two dozen or so small but bright white lights that were sort of swirling around another stationary light that was more orange and maybe three times the size of the others.the smaller lights swirled the larger one for a few minutes and then broke away from it left a few at a time slithering across the sky after each other in a snake like motion.the small lights followed one another but still moved around randomly.  Organic movements no sharp angles or major speed variations.  It was a clear night and lights were very very high up.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
White orb of light visible from I70 somewhere between 2-91 and Lees Summit rd. moving to the east.;2011-11-23 01:45:00;5 mins;White orb of light visible from I70 somewhere between 2-91 and Lees Summit rd. moving to the east. I was driving west-bound on I-70, between 2-91 hwy and lees summit rd  exit i noticed an orb moving slowly my direction.  It passed over me about the time i reached the offramp and had to get out for a better look!   So i jump out of the car and this object seems to stop moving, im just standing there almost right underneath it and i just cant figure out what it is.   Ive seen quite a few helicopters at night in this area but it didnt have any of the same lights the others have had, and no blade noise !  I have to add that i felt so drawn to this object i pulled my car over on the side of the hiway at almost 2 am. . . and after i did the object stopped for almost 5 mins and i swear it felt like it was watching me back!

Strange light above rural Independence.;2012-06-16 00:00:00;1 minute;Strange light above rural Independence. Wife and I were at a drive in movie.  She looked up to the west and elbowed me to do the same. We saw a very bright white light projecting perpendicular to the movie.  This lasted about 10 seconds, then the light faded out like shrinking into a hole or being affected by an iris like in a camera and disappeared.  It appeared to be high in altitude, we could see aircraft crossing our line of sight, the light was appeared to be at the same altitude.  Personal thought is that we witnessed a dimensional jump of some sort. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135

Noticed to high left in sky what appeared first to be a bright star.   ((anonymous report));2017-07-16 03:30:00;2.5 hours;Went out to smoke a cig at 3AM on back porch.  Noticed off to high left in sky what appeared first to be a bright star.  But realised it was rotating flashing colors orange, red, yellowish in a triangle type formation.   No sound, couldn't been a plane, but after seeing the colors, knew it was not a star.   I recorded a few 3 min, 5 min sessions.  Took few pics.   I'm blown away.  This is real deal.

2 lights, 1 craft flying slowly, covered by clouds.;2020-01-11 23:18:00;2 minutes;2 lights, 1 craft flying slowly, covered by clouds. My friend and I were outside when I noticed 2 lights go across the sky at the same time/speed/distance apart, leading us to believe it was coming from one huge craft.  It appeared to be right above the clouds so the shape was hard to see, but the lights were visible. The lights were a yellow/white.  The object was moving pretty slowly going from north to south.  The closest sound I can compare it to, would be a distorted helicopter.  It definitely was not a helicopter tho.  It was low enough to hear but high enough that it was concealed by clouds.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
