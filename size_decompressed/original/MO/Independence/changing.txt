Large, starry light changing shape to triangle/diamond over Independence, MO.;2017-06-10 03:00:00;2 hours;Large starry light changing shape to triangle/diamond over Independence, MO I was laying in bed and saw a light in the sky out my bedroom balcony door window.  I thought it was a street lamp at first, but it was not.  It was high in the sky south east of my house.  It appeared to change shape from like a star to a triangle and/or diamond shape.   It must has been quite large for me to have thought is was a streetlight.  It was slowly moving north west toward me and higher in the sky, as I had the frame of my door to use as a reference.  It got so I had to get up out of my bed to continue watching it.   By 5 am you could not see it anymore.  It also seemed to have some colored lights possibly such as orange and blue but I was too far away from it to be sure about that.  Did anyone else notice this?;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135

Cluster formation over Independence, MO. (4th time seen) I have video this time. Beam occurred on  prior event on 6/21.;2017-06-25 04:00:00;30 minutes;Cluster formation over Independence, MO. (4th time seen) I have video this time. Beam occurred on  prior event on 6/21. I have video this time.  The event occurrred one hour later this time and was only 30 mins.  I have 10 mins. of video.  It appears to be a cluster perhaps with smaller ships around a large ship.  During my last previous sighting (6/21) there was a flash beam.  During that sighting I was awakened from sleep at 3am to see this.  Furthermore, I was so ill 48 hrs later (6/23) that I couldn't get out of bed.  I hope the two aren't related.  I did not get any sleep hardly on 6/21 or 6/22, so I was very sleep deprived. I did hear an airplane in this video also, and it is on the tape, but it was coming from a different direction and I never saw it.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
Went outside to take out some trash.  Look up and I see a odd crescent shaped object in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-13 15:00:00;Few minutes;Went outside to take out some trash.  Look up and I see a odd crescent shaped object in the sky.  I kept looking for a few seconds and it changed its shape into a triangle.   I've always believed in UFOs and always wanted to see one.  I can't be quite sure because it was really far and high in the sky, but I do believe it was something of sorts.
