Observed black triangular object with lights at points heades SSE at treetop level.;1989-12-01 22:00:00;3minutes;Observed black triangular object with lights at points heades SSE at treetop level. Black triangular object traveling SSE across US 291 south of 23rd st.  Object made no noise.  Travelled at close to 60 mph (est) which seemed slow for an airplane, but thought could be Stealth Bomber since Richards-Gebauer Airbase was in KC.  This made no sense though, since AB is way south and west of this location.  AB does not base the B-2.  They were later deployed to Whiteman AFB.  I have seen and heard the B-2 since then, and can tell you that what I saw was not that.  I would estimate size as roughly front to back 50 ft side to side 150 ft. No blinking strobe, no navigation lights. I experienced no electrical disturbance, no time loss.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  Triangle in Independence, Mo.;1996-08-01 02:00:00;unknown;Triangle in Independence, Mo. MY HUSBAND AND I WERE OUT VERY EARLY EVERY MORNING BETWEEN 1-6am. WE WERE CONTRACTORS FOR A LOCAL NEWSPAPER. WE WERE BETWEEN RESIDENCES AND WERE STAYING TEMPORARILY AT A LOCAL MOTEL IN INDEPENDENCE, MO. THERE WAS A 4-WAY STOPLIGHT ABOUT 1/4 MILE FROM THE HOTEL. THIS PART OF TOWN IS PARTICULARLY HILLY. AT ANY RATE, THE MOTEL DRIVEWAY WAS IN A VALLEY OF A LARGE HILL.I RECALL TELLING MY HUSBAND THAT NIGHT THAT ItSEEMED EERILY QUIET THIS NIGHT.THE AIR WAS STILL. AS WE TURNED ON OUR HEADLIGHTS AND CRESTED THE HILL OF THE INTERSECTION, WE SAW A VERY STRANGE SIGHT INDEED. FOR, HOVERING DIRECTLY ABOVE THE INTERSECTION, AND JUST RIGHT ABOVE THE POWERLINES AND TREES, SAT AN IDLE, LIGHTED TRIANGULAR-SHAPED CRAFT. ONE ANGLE SEEMED TO BE FACING DIRECTLY AT US. YOU MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT BEING ON A HILL, THIS THING SEEMED MONSTROUS. THE LIGHT WAS BRIGHT, YET NOT NEAR BLINDING, I LOOKED AT MY HUSBAND IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND THE INSIDE OF OUR VAN LOOKED AS THOUGH FLOODED WITH DAYLIGHT. WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS WE REMAINED AT THE LIGHT, AS IF TO SILENTLY ASK EACH OTHER FOR REASSURANCE AT WHAT WE WERE BOTH SEEING. THE STRANGEST THING TO ME WAS THE DEADLY SILENCE. SOMEHOW IN ONE'S MIND, A WHOLE TANGLE OF SNIPPETS OF REALITY ATTEMPT TO CONVEY THOUGHTS TO YOUR BRAIN IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS. WE BELIEVED ANY MECHANISM THIS ENORMOUS SIZE MUST BE OPERATED ON SOME KIND OF ENGINE, OR OTHER SOURCE OF POWERING. STILLNESS - NOT A SOUND. THE LIGHTS THEMSELVES FELT LIKE THEY WERE PENETRATING OUR VERY SOULS. WE FELT AS IF WE WERE NOT SO MUCH TARGETED FOR THIS MEETING AS MUCH AS WE FELT WE UNDULY INTERRUPTED WHATEVER THE MEANING OF IT'S OCCUPANCY ABOVE THE EARLY MORNING INTERSECTION. THIS MADE US FEEL SOMEHOW, STRANGELY, GUILTY. WE FEEL THAT WHATEVER IT'S PURPOSE, IT BECAME FOILED BY OUR PRESENCE. I STARTED FRANTICALLY YELLING GO THROUGH THE LIGHT, JUST GET AWAY FROM IT. GO....NOW!! MY HUSBAND LATER TOLD ME HE REFUSED TO MOVE THE VAN UNDERNEATH THE OBJECT FOR AN UNKNOWN FEAR. HE ALSO RELATED HE HAD AN URGE TO PUT IT IN REVERSE, AS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS THING. BEFORE OUR VERY EYES, IT DISAPPEARED HEADING west HWY 24 TOWARD THE TOWN PROPER. THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT LIKE A STREAM OF LIGHT, OR A WHISPING AWAY AS MUCH AS JUST VANISHING, SILENTLY, AS IT HOVERED EARLIER. WE WERE SPEECHLESS, STUNNED, AND THE DIGITAL CLOCK-RADIO IN OUR VAN WAS A SCRAMBLED DISPLAY. IN SILENCE, MY HUSBAND PROCEEDED DOWN M=291 HWY TOWARDS OUR NIGHTLY DESTINATION. I KEPT LOOKING UP AT THE SKY, WHICH SEEMED SLIGHTLY OVERCAST AND FOUND NO STARS. MY EYES ALSO KEPT CLOSE WATCH IN THE SIDE MIRROR. WHEN WE REACHED OUR POINT, WE LEARNED A ROUTINE 12 MIN DRIVE BECAME 2.5 HOURS.  IT WAS 4:30 WHEN WE ARRIVED. WE CALL IT A TIME WARP FOR LACK OF ANY FURTHER LOGIC, AND IT SEEMS TO BE A TOPIC OF INTERESTED CONVERSATION ONCE IN A WHILE BETWEEN US, YET FOR THE MOST PART, WE ARE EACH JUST REMINDED SILENTLY WITHIN OURSELVES OF THE QUESTIONS THAT SUMMER OF 1996, THAT REMAIN WITH NO ANSWERS.

silent triangle flyover multiple landing lights;2000-05-13 22:00:00;8 seconds;silent triangle flyover multiple landing lights Dark triangle, with about eight landing lights spanning about one third of the way back of each leading edge, heading from west to east and a little south. About eight seconds within sight, silent but could hear a faint aircraft sound far to southwest. Witness 1 is an ex Kansas City Aviation Dept. employee, has flown small aircraft, object seemed to fly at about stall speed but no visual reference to determine altitude or speed. If they were landing lights I would guess altitude to be appx 3000ft and size of the object to be appx. the size of a 707.Witness 2 has seen stealth bombers in the air many times (he worked at Whiteman Airforce Base) says the object was not a stealth bomber. ((NUFORC Note:  We highlight this case because we spoke at length with the witness, who is quite experienced in the aviation field.  He is quite familiar with all types of aircraft, and he reports that the object witnessed was like no aircraft he has ever witnessed before.);39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
I was in the presence of an aluminum looking triangle aircraft that was very loud, moved very smoothly and ws flying very low .;2001-07-04 19:30:00;15 sec.;I was in the presence of an aluminum looking triangle aircraft that was very loud, moved very smoothly and ws flying very low . At 7:30 pm on the 4th of July, it was still very light - I was in my back yard and heard a very loud, low jet aircraft sound.  I was startled as it seemed very low, very close and very loud. The sound appeared immediately before the sighting. I looked up and saw it coming into my view over the tree tops, it passed over my head and watched it fly out of sight.  It never hovered and it was not moving at an abnormally fast speed and the movement was very smooth. For as loud and large as it was, it didn't seem to be going very fast.  The sighting took about 15 sec. It was in the shape of a triangle - a brushed aluminum looking material - with 2 flashing red lights on the tip of the wings.  It was moving forward.  It had a wide acoridan design on the underside.  It was a very strange experience and I knew immediately that I had just seen something very unusual.  Background: I have recently moved to the midwest from Houston, I am a middleclass, white female, mother and grandmother, single and am totally sane and have never seen anything unusual before no have no desire to go looking for unusual people or things or to have contact with aliens.  But I DO believe I saw something that is NOT a US aircraft.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
Observed triangular object moving over house.;2004-09-15 02:00:00;10 minutes;Observed triangular object moving over house. I am submitting this now because I just came across this site.  The date is approximate as I remember the time of year because I had just finished building a deck on the rear of my home and that was in mid-September of 2004.  I am a high school debate teacher and had only started school a few weeks earlier, so that also reminds me of the approximate date.  But I cannot recall the exact date at this time. I woke up around 1:00 in the morning for no particular reason and could not fall back asleep.  After sitting in the living room for a bit, I decided to go out on my  deck to have a cigarette. It was a completely clear night.  I do not recall if there was a moon or not.  As I was smoking, I spent time just staring up at the stars.  I am not much for astronomy, but there was nothing else to really do and I was trying to get myself back into a mode for sleep. I first noticed something in the sky to the west of my home.  I was sitting in the back of the house which faces northeast.  I had been sitting outside for about 20 minutes at this point.  I did not identify what I saw as an object at first.  There was a triangular shape, but my first thought was that it was a flock of Canadian geese.  I continued to watch only because it was something to look at.  The shape continued to come slowly from the west heading roughly southwest at what seemed to be a rather slow pace. After what felt like less than 5 minutes of watching, the shape was pretty much directly over the back yard of my neighbor to the immediate west.  This is where I had my first impression that what I was looking at wasn't a flock of geese. First, as it was coming toward my yard, it seemed far too rigid lines to be geese.  The shape seemed fairly low to the ground too.  I estimate it was no higher than 1000 ft, but likely less.  As the shape moved over into my yard, I noticed that the stars didn't seem right between the two lines of the V shape.  By that I mean they seemed a bit fuzzier and dimmed. What really convinced me that I was not seeing geese was when I noticed a straight line connecting the two ends at the rear of the V shape, making it a triangle.  As I tried to come to grips with what my brain was saying I was seeing, I also noticed a strange distortion along the outer edges of the triangular object.  I would best describe it as being like the heat waves one sees coming off of hot pavement.  This distortion was visible on all three sides, but I am not sure I would have noticed it if the sky hadn't been so clear otherwise. There were no noticable lights coming from the object and absolutely no sound.  Any other time I have seen geese flying in a V formation, I recall usually eventually hearing a goose call or two as they fly overhead.  Here, it was total silence. The object continued to move in a straight line to to the southwest.  As the object moved past my yard I could no longer see the outer edge distortion, however there were still three distinct sides to the object.  After about a total of 10 minutes or so of viewing the object was out of sight again. (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
Hovering triangular craft with many lights seen in the night sky.;2011-10-04 20:00:00;4 to 5 minutes;Hovering triangular craft with many lights seen in the night sky. I am a 56-year-old metalsmith, mother and grandmother.  I have some college education, but no degees.  I have lived in all over the USA but am currently residing in the area I was born in. On October 4Th, 2011, around 8:00 pm, I was driving home from a day of running errands.  As I drove down the street I live on, I glanced down another street that angles off at a Y intersection.  Above our neighborhood clubhouse, I saw a mass of lights that were appeared to be stationary and about 200 to 500 feet above the building. I  stopped my car, backed up a few feet and turned down that street to see what it was.  Of course I was thinking, 'It's a UFO!' 'No, it can't be.' 'Oh my gosh, it's a space ship!'  I drove slowly as I looked at the mass of lights until I got almost directly under it.  I could see the whole underside of the craft and it was enormous! I could see that it was a triangle-shaped craft with lights running parallel to the edges but about a foot away from them.  The underside was slightly rounded and completely smooth.  I couldn't see any openings or interruptions in it's smooth, Grey-black metallic surface.  The lights were white, orange, red, green and blue and very bright. They weren't inset nor did they protrude.  They seemed to be a part of the underneath, which appeared to be almost fluid, like mercury.   As I slowed down to a stop in the middle of the street, it suddenly rotated and then moved up and across the street at an angle.  It was moving slowly enough that I could almost keep up with it, but I lost sight of it as I turned the corner.  Just past the corner there was a small group of people running toward the next corner.  One of the men yelled to me,  Did you see it?   I answered, Yes!   He replied, That was a freakin' spaceship!   After slowing down at the stop sign, I followed the streets around toward my house and, as I turned back onto my street, I saw that it was moving right in front of me. It was then that I realized that my heart was pounding so hard that I could actually hear it.  Then I noticed that the craft was going straight toward my house, but, for some reason, I wasn't afraid. I was in awe of it's enormous size and the fact that I was witnessing something so spectacular!   As I approached my house, I realized that it had stopped again, this time just past my house, as if it was waiting for me. I pulled into the driveway and started honking the horn for my daughter to come outside and see it. I jumped out of the car and just as I was turning to run inside, it rotated and then darted over the trees, up and away so fast that it disappeared completely within a second. I was almost to the front door when I realized that I forgot to turn the car off or even shut the door. My purse was still inside it so I ran back, gathered my things, turned the engine off and ran inside to tell my daughter. I'm still not sure if she believed me, even though my heart was still pounding really fast and hard and I was talking so fast she could barely understand me. I went back outside to see if the other people who saw it were still heading down toward my house, but they were gone. I couldn't find them and I don't know which house they lived in or if they were even ne! ighbors or visitors. I couldn't imagine going door to door asking if anyone had seen the UFO. I did ask my immediate neighbors but they were either gone or not looking outside at the time it appeared. I later watched the local news but there was no mention of it.  It was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life! It was not any kind of aircraft I have ever seen. I have been online reading about new aircraft designs all day and can't find anything that looks in any way like what I saw. I also can't find any articles about aircraft that have been developed to move the way this space craft did nothing that rotates before it moves away or hovers, even though it was as big as three large houses. It was totally silent and very fluid in it's movements. It really doesn't matter to me if anyone else believes that I saw a UFO because I know what I saw and it wasn't of this earth.  As I think back about the incident, I realize that I was drawn to it in a strange way. The fear I expected to have was non-existent and was replaced by excitement and awe. I almost didn't have a choice of whether I drove away from it or straight toward it and, when it was gone, I somehow knew it wasn't coming back anytime soon. I didn't even think about driving around looking for it to appear somewhere else because I just knew it was gone. I had seen what I was supposed to see. It had fulfilled it's mission. Those were the feelings it left me with. But why did I need to see it? What happened to the other people I spoke to? They ran about a half mile from where I first saw them and yet, when I went back outside less than a minute later, they were gone. Where did they go? Isn't it human nature to stand around talking about something so unusual? Yet none of this seemed strange to me two nights ago when it happened. This has changed me forever. Even though I've always believed t! here is life on other planets, this made it much more real than I could have imagined!;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
Equilateral triangle witnessed at night.;2020-07-24 04:30:00;1 minute;Equilateral triangle witnessed at night **This is an AMENDED report with correct date**  At approximately 04:30 this morning, an apparently triangle shaped aircraft with lights on three corners and an additional light on the center of the bottom of the aircraft.  The three equally spaced lights on the apparent corners were white or very light orange.  The center light appeared to be made up of a white and red light it appeared as if the bottom light was a red light engulfed by white light. I viewed the aircraft as it approached toward my line of sight from the direct south at a relatively low altitude, probably less than 1000 feet.  The craft was traveling slowly, slower than I have seen an airplane fly, and as it continued away from me towards the north, the appearance of what would be the lights on the rear corners changed appearance, and began to resemble the center light, as a red light surrounded by white lights.  The red portion of the rear lights (which appeared as being on the left and right) were blinking in a synchronized fashion, ie, there was still a white light on the front and corners, but the two rear lights also appeared to contain smaller red lights which blinked at the same time. The aircraft also made a very low-frequency pulsing sound, more like an earthquake or distant rolling thunder than any aircraft I have heard.  My house is located approximately 67 miles from Whiteman AFB, and I have witnessed stealth aircraft over my house before, however this unknown object made a completely different sound than the stealth Air Force craft I have heard/seen. I have also subsequently watches videos of stealth aircraft flying at night, and it's important to note that no lights extended beyond the three equally spaced white lights, like the red and green lights seen on the wingtips of known aircraft. I was unable to discern any shape beyond what was conveyed by the three equally spaced white lights. I think it is also important to note that I do not live near an airport approach, and have never witnessed an aircraft flying along this path at any altitude or time of day.  This was witnessed in my back yard, so I am quite familiar with what is normal over this piece of land.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
Traiangular silent craft with three white lights flew very low over our heads;2020-10-04 22:00:00;3 minutes;Traiangular silent craft with three white lights flew very low over our heads I was outside with my wife when she pointed out three white lights moving from east to west. The lights were in a triangular shape and did not project beams.  There was a black or grey dark craft outline between and above the lights. This object was flying very low - we would guess under 1,000 feet. It moved very slowly across the sky over our house directly towards downtown Kansas City. There was no sound at all as you would expect if it were a plane or helicopter. It just flew silently overhead and slowly disappeared into the distance. We did not think to get a photo. I would think that other people had to have seen this.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
