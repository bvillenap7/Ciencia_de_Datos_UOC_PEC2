Other;1974-09-15 22:30:00;Unknown;Other   In response to the report given on 9-25-81 in Blue Springs Missouri. The girl experienced a levitation, and after a free fall back into her Bed. She asked if anyone had experienced this type of thing.  I assume to help her feel better about what happened. I am reporting and responding to the person who gave this report.  I want to tell her that I share a similar experience.  I am from the same area, likely within 10 miles. Here is my report:  I was 12 years old.  I lived in Jackson County Missouri.  My location was South of what is now called the Susquehanna.  It was a small farm.  The year was 1974.  It was just after 10 pm on a school night in September.  All I can recall is this:  I was paralyzed and floating over my bed.  I then dropped to my bed.  The fall made me bounce.  This occurred three times in that month.  There are those that may think you are crazy. Be relieved that there is at least one person that knows you are telling the truth. P.S.  I donâ€™t know if your site needs any more information.  If you do please email me.  I will respond.  I would appreciate my anonymity be kept.  If you do not use this as a report,  please forward a copy to the person who gave the 9-25-81 report.  The truth is that this is the first time I have communicated this to anyone.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
Aircraft in formation;1999-09-01 23:30:00;1 minute;Aircraft in formation Peter: I am writing on behalf of the fireball tonight. Tonight while out on the lawn, myself and 4 other neighbors witnessed flashing aircraft lights heading east. The aircraft appeared to be flying in a formation. There were three total, and the aircraft appeared to be within yards of each other. 2 in the front side by side, and one following. It could not have been personal aircrafts or commercial aircrafts flying so close together. It is not normal to see military aircraft in our area, and myself and my neighbors were wondering why they were out flying in formation. Could they have been patrolling the area after the reported sightings tonight? I hope one of Art's listeners comes foward with video of this object. My information may not be f value, but I thought it was worth submitting. I never see military aircraft in our area. Keep up the good work!;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
