UFO over skylight controls radio- possible visitation.;2005-07-15 00:00:00;unknown;UFO over skylight controls radio- possible visitation. Around 11:30 pm on July 15, 2005 I heard strange noises in the house.  I was watching watching T.V. at the time. My husband was out of town and I was alone in the house. At first I thought the cats were in the house and were playing and running around.  But then I looked outside and they were on the porch sleeping.  Then I heard loud thumping sounds coming from my bedroom overhead, like someone was walking in heavy boots and making noise on purpose.  A few seconds later, I heard the side patio door open and close twice. I turned off the T.V. and went to investigate and when I did I noticed a low-level mechanical humming sound that seemed to have no source. The side door was locked from the inside, so no one could have opened it, yet I clearly heard the door open. I decided to double check the doors and go to bed and listen to Coast to Coast AM to hear Peter Davenport.   While lying in bed I looked up at the skylight and noticed that it was completely black outside.  There was no rain that night, and even with clouds you can always see some light from the street light across the street.  I remember thinking that was odd.  I was listening intently as Peter came on and was talking about the recent sighting in Idaho on July 8.  I remember looking at the clock at approximately 12:45 AM. I don't remember going to sleep, but the next thing I knew the radio was on very loud and the clock said 1:30 PM, and I had missed hearing the witnesses talk about their experience. I don't have an explanation as to how the radio got so loud. I turned the radio off, then looked up and saw that the skylight was not black anymore, and had the familiar bluish glow from the streetlight again. The low humming sound was also gone. I have no idea what happened.  I believe that I had a missing time experience, and that something or someone did not want me to hear the radio, but also wanted to get my attention. They did. Was this an abduction or a visitation? I may need to be hypnotized to find out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Fast bright object over Independence, MO;2007-09-27 20:23:00;20 seconds;Fast bright object over Independence, MO My daughter, Maria and I went outside my house last night at 8:23 PM and noticed a bright white fast-moving object came into view at about 45 degrees up from the horizon and moved swiftly across the sky from West to NNE. It was the brightness of Sirius or maybe brighter, and the size of half of an eraser head at arm's length - close to the size of Venus.  I could not tell what the distance from earth was, but it was high up at the altitude I would expect to see a satellite at. The object changed trajectory at 80 degrees to a more NE direction.  It was at that point that I said maybe it was not a satellite - it then faded slowly and moved UP and it was gone at about 110 degrees or so.  The entire sighting lasted maybe 20 seconds. We both came away with the idea that it did not look like a satellite or a plane, and by going up and away, this would indicate something else.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
Observed 2 white lights moving in tandem forward and back, up and down just before dawn.;2020-10-10 06:15:00;1.5 hours;Observed 2 white lights moving in tandem forward and back, up and down just before dawn. On October 10, 2020 at about 6:15am Central time (still completely dark outside) I observed from inside my kitchen looking out through my sliding glass door, toward the east, two white lights separated by approximately 50 yards.  These lights, one brighter than the other, moved in tandem together forward and backwards, and up and down a number of times.  I was located about a block and a half away from the lights looking across an open field.  The incident lasted for approximately 30 minutes. The activity was occurring above a paved road.  After the 30 minutes these lights settled down behind a tree line but I could still see the lights through the limbs and leaves while it was still dark. As the sky began to brighten a fog appeared to form on the field toward the east side near the lights.  I don't know if this was a natural fog or if it was generated by something having to do with the lights.  I continued to observe the area where the lights went down, without taking my eyes off the area, for about another hour. By now, the sun had risen above the horizon and the lights had not reappeared from below the tree line. At this point, there was no sign of the lights.  I never saw them leave the area.  I don't know what happened to them and could no longer continue my observation.;39.0725551351352;-94.4112935135135
