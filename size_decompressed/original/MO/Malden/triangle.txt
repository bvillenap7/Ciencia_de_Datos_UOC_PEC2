On July 4th of 2011, at about 9:30 pm, me and my great uncle had been launching fireworks for an hour when we decided it was time to finish up.  We were on our way back to his truck when I spotted a red object with a flashing whitish-yellow light. the light wasn't flashing but had the looked as if on fire, but it was flying level.  After flying for several miles in sight it faded into the sky. When we got back to my house, I still had company.  Me and my great uncle explained what we saw.  After we finished my mother said that my great uncle's mom had said to her I just saw the strangest thing.  Well I swear I saw a ufo.   My mother then told us that my great uncle's mom's description matched our's.;36.5703;-89.9736
