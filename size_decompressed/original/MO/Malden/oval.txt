Solid oval light moving extremely fast.;2009-05-15 23:25:00;15 seconds;Solid oval light moving extremely fast. I was standing in my drive-way talking to my wife when I looked up and saw what I thought at the time to be a shooting star and pointed it out to my wife.  I then kept looking around the sky for other shooting stars when I saw the object again blinking fast and traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and was oval in shape.  The object was like one solid light.  I was in the Air Force and had been around aircraft most of my life and knew that it definetly wasn't an airplane or anything similar.  The object moved across the sky and then vanished.  I felt as though my heart had dropped to my feet because I had never seen an object move through the sky that fast.;36.5703;-89.9736
