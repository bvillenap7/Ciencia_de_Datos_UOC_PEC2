I was sent to Osage Beach Missouri, (Lake of the Ozarks) to train for a new job.  On July 12th myself and a colleague left the Bose Factory Store in the outlet mall in Osage Beach. We proceeded to get some ice cream across the street from the mall. We noticed an yellow circle shaped object in the sky .  It appeared to be falling straight down then it stopped and remained still. Next it appeared to split into two objects for about 30 to 45 seconds. It then formed back into one object. It then proceeded to speed of. We got in the car and followed it. After about three minutes the object stopped for 30 seconds ( remained suspended in the sky with no movement) and then speed of at an amazing speed. We were both sober and both witnessed the same thing we often talk about the experience. I wish it could be explained. It was unbeleivable. I have tried to comprehend it many times. Was it a Magnetic force that was caused by natural phenomena ? ( Earths magnetic fields, Gases, Electricity Vapor ect.) Was it some secret military craft being tested in the remote part of Missouri? Was It a real UFO?  What were they doing in the Ozarks? Were they there for the water from the Lake?  Were they hiding in the Lake or in the remoteness  of the Ozarks? Did any one else see the same craft?  Were there similiar sighting that day or any other day in the same area? My heart was pounding?  I am know a true beleiver of UFO's.  I long too experince this again.  I long for an explanation. Only God Knows? Wa;38.1385904545455;-92.6654090909086
