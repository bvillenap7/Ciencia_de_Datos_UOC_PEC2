Three bright lights in a triangle shape moving fast and completely silent before vanishing into thin air.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-11 01:50:00;7 seconds;Three bright lights in a triangle shape moving fast and completely silent before vanishing into thin air. Sitting by the lake at night we saw this:  3 bright orange-ish/white lights in a triangle shape moving from west to east in the night sky.   The lights were bright and object was completely silent and also moving at a very rapid pace.  Initially thought it was a helicopter landing at a nearby hospital with how low it was, then I realized there was no sound at all and it was moving far too fast.   All of a sudden, it veered south very rapidly, this is when the triangle became most clear, and within a second or two, it was like the thing disappeared into thin air.
