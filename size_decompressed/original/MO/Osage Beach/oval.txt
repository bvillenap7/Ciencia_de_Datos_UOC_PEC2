It appeared to look like a fireball or glowing helium balloon.   It was moving straight for approximately 20 seconds, hovered for several seconds and then made what appeared to be a 90 degree turn upward to the southwest.  We watched for approximately 30 more seconds and until it disappeared into the sky at which time it was the size of a star.  Also during the last 30 seconds we saw two bright flashes. We are christian professional adults who thought this to be a cool yet somewhat scary experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
