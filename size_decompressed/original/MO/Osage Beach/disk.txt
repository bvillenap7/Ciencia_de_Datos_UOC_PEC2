Single slow cruising orb over the grand glaze bridge;2011-06-28 22:34:00;3 min.;Single slow cruising orb over the grand glaze bridge I was out on lakeside porch when I noticed a bright single orb moving across the sky around the glaze arm of lake ozark.   It was in the sky at a lower altitude but following through normal air traffic space.   I live directly under air space that sees military and commercial air traffic.   This craft had a glow that encompassed the vehicle making it one continuous orb of white light.   About two and a half minutes of sustained slow flight, I noticed a jet trailing the object and it disappeared instantly in the sky;38.1385904545455;-92.6654090909086
