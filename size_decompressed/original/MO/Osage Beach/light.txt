While walking our dog my girlfriend and I witnessed another light in the sky.   The light moved slowly through the air, at what looked like a high altitude.    We only saw it for 10 to 15 seconds before it vanished. this is the second sighting we have seen in the area, but this is the first sighting i have reported.;38.1385904545455;-92.6654090909086
No sound.  Bright red balls, slow speed.;2014-07-24 21:00:00;20 minutes;No sound.  Bright red balls, slow speed. Fly toward Grand Glaze pool, below Grand Glaze Bridge west to east +-. One followed by a second (20 sec later) then turn south and elevate for 2 minutes maybe 2000 feet and disappear. Three followed by a four (20 sec later) then turn south and elevate for 2 minutes maybe 2000 feet and disappear. Five followed by a six (20 sec later) then turn south and elevate for 2 minutes maybe 2000 feet and disappear. The next 3 were more random but same flight path. The last flew directly towards the pool and was bigger but seem to drop some red flair type material;38.1385904545455;-92.6654090909086
