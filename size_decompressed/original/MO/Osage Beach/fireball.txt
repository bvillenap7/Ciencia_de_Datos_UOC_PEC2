Very UNUSUAL lens reflection, atmospheric conditions or alien ball of light/fire;2010-08-03 18:00:00;45 minutes;hello,  if U go to my site below and watch the Grand Glaze movie... NEVER seen this before... http://www.realestateozarks.com/live/   We do have all the still images taken every 5 seconds.  This was caught from the camera and I am NOT sure if anyone saw this live. Very UNUSUAL lens reflection, atmospheric conditions or alien ball of light/fire appears in this movie. Watch close at 1800 [6pm] till about 18:45 when it descends into the water.  Look very close one can almost see something in the water coming toward the ball of light as it starts to enter the lake. IMHO the sun is in wrong position to cause this type of lens reflection.  This camera has been set up for over 2 months making daily movies and NOTHING close to this has ever happened before or since. In God We Trust! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.1385904545455;-92.6654090909086

They were moving pretty slow at first, then picked up speed as they went out of site.  About 5 minutes later, another one appeared..same shape and color and also disappeared.  Then about 5 minutes later...another one...doing exactly same thing.;38.1385904545455;-92.6654090909086
