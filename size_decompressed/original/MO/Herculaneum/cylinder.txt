My daughters were coming home around 4 pm on a back road, turned a corner and saw in the sky a metallic object with the sun reflecting off of it.  The object was similar to cylindrical in shape and had what appeared to be landing legs protruding from the bottom of it.  The object remained in the location for less than one minute, as they turned another bend in the road, the object was gone.  They continued to watch for it, but it never reappeared.;38.2637;-90.3868
