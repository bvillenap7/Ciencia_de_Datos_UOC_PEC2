Driving home on HWY FF outside of Centralia.  It was still light outside sun was setting   my husband noticed the shiny object first.  It almost looked like a crescent moon,except it was not upright, instead it was laying horizontal.  It was pretty far away from us.  We stared at the object for about 7 min.  It was shiny like a star but much to big and not shaped like a star.  When we turned onto Rt Z the object vanished!  Didn't fade or move just disappeared.;39.1925;-92.148
