Shining, hovering red craft in western sky over central MO.;2007-04-04 22:35:00;4-6 minutes;Shining, hovering red craft in western sky over central MO. At approximately 10:35 pm, on Wednesday, April 4th a red orb was noticed in the west-northwestern sky.  The craft/orb was very bright and much bigger compared to the stars that shown.  It was probably several miles away, and shifted its position in the sky (hovered- the craft was not stationary).  The object was silent.  This was observed for 4-6 minutes by 4 witnesses.  The object seemed to arc as it picked up speed going over the horizon before it was no longer viewable.;39.1925;-92.148

Same situation as reported on 04/04/07.  Shining red orb shaped craft in the west-northwestern sky at same time as the previous sighting (10:35 pm).  This time it was only observed for 2-3 minutes, but the object was moving in the same manner.  This time it did not pick up speed as it went over the horizon, it just slowly made its way over the tree line.;39.1925;-92.148
