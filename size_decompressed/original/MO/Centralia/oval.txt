I spotted something moving to my right.it was an oval shaped object with  a light source projecting from the top and bottom.  I went inside to get my camera on the scope and the object descended to  Ian estimated  100 ft. The craft was covered in green, yellow and red panels. It was noiseless. I turned to focus my camera and it was gone.;39.1925;-92.148
