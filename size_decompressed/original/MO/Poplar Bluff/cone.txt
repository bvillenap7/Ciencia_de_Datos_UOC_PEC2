UFO sighting in Poplar Bluff.;2011-05-29 04:05:00;04:25;UFO sighting in poplar bluff. Three of my friends and I were out taking a smoke break at 4:05 a.m. CST.  At 288* west I sighted a red light that seemed to be osculating to white and then to blue.   We joked at first, thinking we were seeing things, then, it became apparent that it was an actual UFO sighting.   The conical or saucer type object emitting colors was moving in any particular direction with no apparent drag.   This object continued moving around and seemed to occasionally emit a brighter red light.   We watched for a good twenty minutes.;36.7685;-90.4096
