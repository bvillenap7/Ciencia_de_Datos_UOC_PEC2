I was driving home from work on '53' outside of Poplar Bluff when a bright blue light appeared at what looked like 300 to 400 feet in the air. I was on a stretch of highway 53 where there where only fields and there where no other vehicles for at least five miles. As it appeared it was moving east towards Burnie Missouri. It was skyblue in color and did not have any flashing lights or trial. It was moving faster than a car but slower than a plane. It then vanished as subtlety as it appeared. The entire incident lasted about five to ten seconds.;36.7685;-90.4096
