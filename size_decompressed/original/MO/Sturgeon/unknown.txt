Rumbling noise Bright light and Silence In MO.;1970-09-15 20:00:00;15-20 minutes;Rumbling noise Bright light and Silence In MO. When we noticed something strange we were all inside the house and it was around 9 or 10 at night. The curauins were pulled because it was dark out and all the lights were on inside the house.   While we were all inside the kitchen we felt and heard a low sounding rumble as if there were a train moving past the house at a slow steady speed. when we looked towards our windows there appeared to be a bright light that was illuminating thru all the windows almost like sunshine during the day. we moved outside thru the front door and when we got outside there was no noise, no vibration from the rumbling we were hearing inside.  Everything outside seemed extremely calm and still and we looked above our heads and there was a bright white light that was above us approximitly 20 to 30 feet.  Couldnt tell the shape of UfO because it was so big we counldnt see the edges of it. It seemed to be there for about 5 minutes then took off with no sound and was so quick it was li! ke it was just there and gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
