Flying orb and and ultrasonic type speed.;2014-04-11 21:00:00;30 minutes;Flying orb and and ultrasonic type speed. We were driving 55 south heading towards Wal-Mart when my wife first noticed the lights, at first I thought it was a remote control toy,  I drove 4 or 5 miles down and made a u-turn that is when I noticed a flying orb, so we stared at the orb and then made our way back to Pevely to watch the lights they had a motion like a helicopter leaf falling from the sky, but much faster and the lights flashed very quickly.   I would estimate distance from us at 200 to 500 feet away.   The orb was chased off by what looked like helicopters. More witnesses appeared watching the strange lights. I will say in the last 2 years there has been a lot of activity in the Jefferson county sky. I am sure that the area should be investigated or at least have someone watch the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain what the witness observed.  We allow for the possibility that the object may have been a model airplane, or a model quad-copter, with LED lights affixed to it.
