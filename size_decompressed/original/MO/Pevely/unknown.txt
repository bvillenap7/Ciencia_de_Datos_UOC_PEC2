One of them was extremely bright looked like a big bright star but alot larger than a star just hovering over our home.  No noise coming from it just hovering, not moving.  The others are smaller and can be mistaken for stars but are brighter we have seen blue lights and red lights flashing thought maybe an airplane but again no noise these are very quiet.  One with the flashing lights was moving across the sky like an airplane would.  The rest of them just hover and kinda twinkle again like a star but much brighter.;38.2795;-90.4118
