UFOs caught flying and dropping.;2014-04-11 20:30:00;4 minutes;UFOs caught flying and dropping On April 11th, 2014 I was driving South on HWY 55 Heading towards Pevely. I looked up because I noticed blue and red lights flashing in the sky.  There were 2-3 objects.  The objects were zip zapping left and right all over the sky extremely fast in front of my eyes.  Looking from my car the size of the objects looked to be the size of an 18 wheeler flying around with red and blue lights flickering around the object.  I was astonished and scrambled to grab my phone to catch quick video footage.  By the time I got my phone out and ready to record the objects had zapped over to the left side of my car which would be the east side of me on HWY 55 right across from the Pevely exit close to the I-55 race way. One of the lights looked to be landed and the other one flew across the sky with a white light the size of the objects got smaller because of the distance they shot.  One blue light looked landed to the right and the white light turned blue and appeared to be landing in an unmarked area.  Amazing!;38.2795;-90.4118
