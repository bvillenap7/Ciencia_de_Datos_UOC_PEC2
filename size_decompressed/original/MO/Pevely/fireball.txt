2 fireball/orbs over Jefferson County Missouri.;2013-07-03 20:00:00;>15 minutes;2 fireball/orbs over Jefferson County Missouri. I saw 2 red orbs or fireballs moving slowly across Jefferson County on the evening of July 3rd around 10 pm?   I saw them driving north on highway 55 between Pevely and Barnhart, one was right above me on the highway and the other was east probably about a football field east of me.  They where moving west at the same speed.. pretty low.   When I got to Arnold and turned onto route 141 westbound and looked south and saw what was probably the trailing orb (the one east of me from when I first saw them).  It looked like it was over the highway in the Barnhart/Imperial area. At the time I wrote these off as burning firework shells or Chinese lanterns but it still bugs me. Any info would be great.;38.2795;-90.4118
