Unidentified large flying object;1994-08-20 22:30:00;3 minutes;Unidentified large flying object I picked up my wife at work in Joplin. We live in the country, so we take the back roads home. It was a unusally dark night. We were about a mile from home. As I went by the river, something came over just above the trees. It was going very slow. I stopped the truck and got out for a better look.I left my truck running and could hear no other sound. I was only 150 to 200 feet away. Curious I walked toward the craft. As I did three illuminated triangles came from it and started my direction. Scared for my safety, I ran to the truck and raced home. I was busy driving. My wife said one of the triangles passed through a telephone pole. When we got home we checked the time to be sure none was lost. Two of our children were with us. We don't talk about it much. The craft must of been dark in color as I could'nt make out a shape. It had nine large lights . Six were gold, with three red in the middle. They were very bright abd I stared at them. That could be why I could'nt see a shape. The newspapers the next day reported mysterious lights in the sky.The triangles had squares around them with a circle in the middle.;37.1614;-94.3133
