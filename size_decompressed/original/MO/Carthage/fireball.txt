I saw a fireball-like object. It was difficult to determine the size since it is nighttime and I am not sure how high it was (although it didn't appear to be too high over the houses in the neighborhood), but I would guess it was at least 2-3 feet in diameter.  It moved very slowly over the houses across the street, and while it flickered and was the color of a flame, it stayed approximately the same size and did not die out (I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees).  There were no sounds coming from it, nor were there any vehicles or aircraft operating in the area.  It was moving far too slowly and lasted too long to be a meteor or anything similar.;37.1614;-94.3133
