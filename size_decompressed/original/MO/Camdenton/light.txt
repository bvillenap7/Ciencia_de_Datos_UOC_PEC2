In the northwest sky a yellow light appeared then a second, then a third between the first two.   They were circular and were nearly touching when all lit.  They lit one right after another and then winked out simultaneously.  They relit following the same pattern.  Then nearly immediately relit farther to the North.  We discussed this and cannot explain it.  We blew it off but have seen it again June 7, and June 8.  A total of 8 witnesses have seen this now and we expect to see it again.  We watch each night since June 7 by 9:30. They looked like Roman candle flares, but did not move and were so precisely placed that they must be on an object.   A10 jets fly here, I wonder if whiteman AFB has an explanation.;38.0185;-92.7677
