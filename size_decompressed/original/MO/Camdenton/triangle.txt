Unfamiliar Black Triangular shaped craft with lights;2001-11-27 05:35:00;1 minute;Unfamiliar Black Triangular shaped craft with lights I was standing on my porch at 5:35 am when I noticed a bright light in the sky .I at first thought it was a planet but then I wondered what planet would be out at this time in the mornig in the northeast and be so bright it would hurt your eyes to look at it . I then noticed it was actually moving towards me . It was a dark triangluar shaped object with three lights That I could see . The very bright light in the center of the craft which was approx three fourths of the way up the craft from the rear , and two reddish orange lights which were smaller with one at each corner in the rear .I could not tell if there may have been a similar small light on the front of the craft as the bright central light made it diffucult to tell and its placement being closer to the front than it was to the rear . It was traveling slowly toward the southwest and as it flew overhead at the altitude it was at I would guess that it would have appeared to be about four inches across at the rear and about five inches in length .Roughly the same size or perhaps a little larger than an A10 would appear at a similar altitude . I live roughly 50 miles northwest of Fort Leonard Wood missouri and A10's frequently fly over our area . As the craft proceeded overhead  I had to walk out from my porch and continue around to keep the craft in sight .I didn't hear any noise coming from the craft nor could I distinguish any exhaust vents on it either . The lights were not strobing and I asked some of my friends and co workers as well as family if all aircraft had strobing lights or not and they could not tell me either .I myself don't ever recall seeing aircraft without strobing lights .The sides of the craft were straight and the tips were rounded . I didn't note any after effects and my eyesight was not affected . The only discomfort noted was only while looking at it because of the intensity of the bright light .As far as backround , I am a 44 year old divorced single parent with three children still living at home .;38.0185;-92.7677
