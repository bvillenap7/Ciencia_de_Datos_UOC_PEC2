Fast moving light;2006-06-18 22:00:00;10 seconds;Fast moving light I was doing some backyard astronomy with my father-in-law. I had been viewing jupiter and we were looking to the south. I noticed a light orange colored light moving from North to South at a high speed. I estimated that it must have been moving much fast than a normal aircraft but not so fast that I ruled it out as such. It appeared to be at a very high altitude. I had a pair of bushnell 12X50 binocs handy and I was able to get a good look. There seemed to be two lights. One big one in front and one tiny one in back. I did not see any red or blue lights on it nor did I see the normal type of strobe that are on most aircraft. I asked my father-in-law what he thought it was and he didn't know, but he said he thought that it zig-zaged a little. I must have been messing with my binocs so I did see that and plus it is hard to hold steady when you are looking at a distant object with binocs. A few seconds later the craft vanished as if it when behind some clouds but there were none. I am certain it was a cloudless night because as most people know clouds affect astronomy. It almost looked like it left the atmosphere. Could have been a plane but it was very odd for one.;37.1814;-94.5594
