After watching fireworks, we were swimming when we noticed a strange orange object slowly moving across the sky.  It was close to the horizon, and eventually disappeared into the treeline.  A few minutes later, we noticed the exact same thing happen again in the same location in the sky.  The objects were a solid orange color roughly in the shape of a horizontal oval and maintained a straight trajectory, not jumping around.  The time was 10:00 PM, and it was a clear night.;38.5504;-92.3845
