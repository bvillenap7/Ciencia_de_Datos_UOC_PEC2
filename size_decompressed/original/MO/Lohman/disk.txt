Metallic object moved and then disappeared in cloudless sky;2020-07-28 16:30:00;30 seconds;Metallic object moved and then disappeared in cloudless sky I noticed a metallic object in NW part of sky. It stood out because there were no contrails.  I watched it move across a cloudless sky for about 30 seconds and then it disappeared.  I watched the area to see if it would reappear but it did not.  There were no clouds for it to go behind. It just was gone.;38.5504;-92.3845
