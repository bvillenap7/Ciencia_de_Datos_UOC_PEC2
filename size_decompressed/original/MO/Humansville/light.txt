At first, I thought it was a star.  But, I noticed it was moving very slowly.;2004-06-26 03:00:00;One minute;I am a security guard for a business in south-west Missouri.  I am also a former police officer.  I have over 25 years in either the police or security industry.  And, I am not prone to seeing things.   I was working late and walking through the parking lot at approximately 3:00am.  The sky was crytal clear and the wind was calm.  I first saw the object out of the corner of my eye.  At first, I thought it was a star.  But, I noticed it was moving very slowly.  Thinking it was an airplane, I watched it.  But, it was moving too slowly for an airplane.  And, it did not have any of the warning lights common to an airplane.  The object moved very slowly from north to south.  It was moving in a straight and level manner.  It did not twist and turn at all.   As I watched, the object slowed down to almost a stop.  At that point, I was convinced it was not an airplane.  After about 10 or 15 seconds, the object sped up to its original speed.  It continued to travel south for about another 20 seconds.  The object then shot stright up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed.  It moved so fast, I could not track it.   I did not see it again.  I watched for it over the following two evenings, but did not see it again.  I have worked at this business for the past several months, and this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this in the area.   Even though I saw something similar many years ago in Colorado, I am not really sold on the existence of UFO's.  But, I would really like to know what that was.  Or, if I am crazy.  I welcome any input.  Thank you.  (Report received by Missouri Investigators Group. http://ufomig.bravehost.com);37.7888;-93.579
