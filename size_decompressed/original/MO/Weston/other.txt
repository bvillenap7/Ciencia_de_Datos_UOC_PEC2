Possibly parallelling Interstate 29 towards Kansas City. I Pulled over immediately. The craft was wedge-shaped (like a common doorstop). Its color was white with black bottom and trailing areas.  I attempted to concentrate on the object's shape and details, but, could detect no hard lines or edges and the object seemed fuzzy (the black sections may have been shadowed areas since the sun was overhead). Conditions were optimum: clear, cool, cloudless. There was/were No observed: lights, beams, contrail, noise, electromagnetic phenomenon,  or emmissions. Observer in good health and sober. Retired police officer with 20+ years military background.  Observed hundreds of warplanes and test aircraft both statically and in flight.  Haven't seen one like this before!;39.4416000000001;-94.921
