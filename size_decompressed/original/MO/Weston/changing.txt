Three Lights off of 45 highway near Weston and over Bluff Road.;2008-01-30 18:16:00;15 mins;Three Lights off of 45 highway near Weston and over Bluff Road My son and friend noticed lights in a very rual area, no street lights gravel raod.  They investigated and when they would slow down the lights would slow down and hoover.   All three lights then combined and made one red light then went straight up into the sky.   When the objects  were hoovering they were at tree height.   The three UFO's also changed colors.  The outside temp. was approx. 30 degrees.  Which rules out grass hoppers, bugs, etc.  My son said that the object was the size of a large trashcan.   Have you ever seen anything like this before?;39.4416000000001;-94.921
