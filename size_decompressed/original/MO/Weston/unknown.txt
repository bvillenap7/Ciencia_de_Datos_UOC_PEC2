I blinked my eyes a couple of times and asked my husband if he saw it.  He and my daughter both looked and saw it.  We watched it for about 5 minutes it appeared to be hovering in one spot, but not close to the ground.  There was a plane flying above it and one  to the side of it, not sure if they were jets they did leave the trail of white behind them.  We did not notice any lights, sound or smoke around the silver object.  We’ve never seen anything like it before.  After watching it for about 5 minutes it just disappeared.;39.4416000000001;-94.921
