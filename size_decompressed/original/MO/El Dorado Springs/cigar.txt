Both times it was going from left to right(south to north), silent, no vapor trail, about the size of a midsize plane, no wings or tail like a blimp. Everyone said it was probably a blimp but did not have the rear fins nor the bulge. Both days were clear no clouds and I watched the obect both times as it silently and steadily made its way rather low until it disappeared. The sightings were only a few days apart and both times in the afternoon.;37.8665;-94.0077
