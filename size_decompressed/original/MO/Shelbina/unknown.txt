It was very late and there were no other cars on the road, entire town seemed to be asleep.  All of the sudden a bright white light lit up brighter than daytime.  Entire wehicle area seemed to be lit up, then white lights began to flash like flashbulb on a paparazzi camera.  I hit the gas in fear to escape the lights.   When I looked back in my rear view mirror I saw only a normal dark intersection.  Not sure if I dodged a possible UFO encounter or abduction.
