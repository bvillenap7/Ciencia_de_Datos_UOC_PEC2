Two orange light flying in patterns now plane, nor plane, nor helicopter could match.;2001-05-26 00:00:00;a few seconds;Two orange light flying in patterns now plane, nor plane, nor helicopter could match. I was 12 at the time (Now 14).  I went into my room and went to bed, but was compelled to look out my window.  I looked and saw two orange colored dots.  The first one flew off quickly, northward, while the second one stayed.  It went up, down to the let, back to the starting point, down right, and slowly rose upward, as if it had just abducted sombody.  After that, I instantly fell asleep, though I know I was not aslep the, for I remember a splitting headache as it left.  It looked as if all this was happening in the center of a trailor court to the west almost a mile away. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.0215;-94.0836
