Fireball in the sky;2016-11-09 05:15:00;5 minutes;We were driving down Hwy 60W when I noticed what looked like a fireball in the sky.  I pointed it out to my boyfriend because it looked like something possibly had blown up and was descending to the ground.   We watched for about 5 mins but the object never moved then we finally lost sight of it.  We could see the Chen trails from two planes in the same proximity and this was nothing at all like that, and MUCH larger.  We did take a picture as we drove.;36.9884;-91.7097
