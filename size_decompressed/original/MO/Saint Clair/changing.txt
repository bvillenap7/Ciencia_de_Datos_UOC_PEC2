hovering spacecraft that moved at a slow speed with red and green lights;2019-12-05 01:00:00;15 seconds;hovering spacecraft that moved at a slow speed with red and green lights I was at my home in St. Clair Missouri my friend and roommate was with me as well .  We noticed earlier that day when the sun set that there were all of these lights in the sky that were stationary at times and would be for long periods of time.  I knew that these were some sort aircraft like nothing I'd ever seen.  When they were moving they were what looked to be an orange ball of light.  then they would move across the sky and would be at varying heights some low as the tree line always moving very fast and had blinking red and green lights.  They would often just disappear from sight.  They made no noise.   This was going on for hours.  Around 1 am I was looking at the field adjacent to my house on the back patio when all the sudden a spacecraft appeared from nowhere before my eyes 30 feet or so from me.  The vessel was hovering 2 or 3 feet off the ground and looked to be the size of a small car.  The shape was rectangular and it looked to have maybe 15 ! or 20 red and green flashing lights.  The vessel moved at a slow pace and was dead quiet.  I stared at this for roughly 15 seconds it made slight turn and at this angle.  the lights were red one side and green on the other and blinking .  The vessel seemed to look almost transparent.  I could see there as a structure but it looked like it was see through.  As is floated behind my garage, and out of sight I thought temporarily.  It never came out the other side I was baffled same as it appeared out of nowhere it disappeared.  I didnt know for sure prior to this but what I saw was not from this world.;38.3342;-90.9742000000001
