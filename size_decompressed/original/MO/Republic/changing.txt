Odd fireball rising above and dipping below the tree line in South Republic, Mo.;2014-09-25 20:00:00;1 hour;Odd fireball rising above and dipping below the tree line in South Republic, Mo. I was looking out the South windows of my home when I seen a fireball colored sphere right above the tree line... At first i thought it was a lantern, like you light and send off at 4th of July, but after I got to watching it I knew it wasn't... It changed shape (sphere to cylinder) and color variation (red, orange, yellow) as it dipped above and below the tree line... It when on approx. for an hour appearing and disappearing.  Very odd shape and no sound at allâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.1229;-93.4758
