Reflective object see on ground by pilot.;2000-10-26 17:30:00;1 minute;Reflective object see on ground by pilot. While teaching a fellow friend to drive, we were heading North bound on FF highway toward Saint Joseph.  About 3 miles outside of Saint Joseph city limits, above the trees there was a 3 dimensional reflective rectangle in the air, not moving, approximately 5 miles away. The reason we were able to see the object is that the sun was setting in the west, and the object was in the north.  Thus, the sun was reflecting off the object. A few seconds later, the object turned clockwise, and was very difficult to see, because of the loss of reflection.  A few seconds later the object disappeared. I am a pilot, and the object I saw was not a commercial aircraft.  The object was too large an not moving.;39.6662;-94.717
