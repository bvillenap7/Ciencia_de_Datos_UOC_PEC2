Across from our house is a very very small pond and hardly holds water.  Then you see a field with no cattle.  The first time we actually used the binoculars last week and saw square bright white windows straight across from left to right.  My husband thought it was a satellite. So I was skeptic until another helicopter went over the house.  They fly at least twice a month.  Helicopters have always flown over our house at night and not a typical sounding aircraft.  I couldn't see anything but could hear a disturbing loud noise that drowned out our T.V.. I then decided to look outside again and this time I saw a colored light in the middle of the squared white lights and looked kind of like a police light but with different colors spinning around.  There are 3 windows on each side of the colored police light and a total of 6.  The window on each side of this craft seems to wrap around.  So I really only see 2 1/2 windows on each side of the police light. Last month my husband and I again were watching T.V. and heard cows that were drowning out the sound of our T.V. one block west from our house around 20:00 pm.  I told my husband I was going to take a drive down the street and I rolled my windows down and could here them really loud like something was bothering them.  Also, I saw that 3 neighbors had their backyard lights on that faced the pasture and farm.  It was unusual for the neighbors to keep their lights on like that because even in the summer when we ride bikes every other night we never seen them on. I just took another look out the window and they moved south from where they were.;39.4866;-94.553
