First I saw one red light in the sky as we were driving home.  Iasked my husband, what is that?  Then as he looked another one appeared beside it.  Then they disapeared then 3 red lights apeared in a row then one appeared north of the others then a smal light circled through the sky and they all dissapeared.   We had never seen anything like it and were terrified!!;37.0015;-90.9956

I dismissed it as falling stars shoot across the sky and fade out.  Then a few minutes later she said there it is again...I looked up and saw a star like light moving slow then suddenly it got VERY bright and faded away in a circular fashion and disappeared.  I will never forget it.  It was a strange night because although the sky was completely clear I kept seeing bright flashes of light that was exactly like lightning lighting up entire sky and rumble of thunder but it was clear with zero clouds.  So weird. Never rained or clouded up or anything.  Cannot explain it and I am a skeptic.  It was amazing.  After that happened I grabbed my GoPro and aimed it at the sky and set it to night time lapse. I left it all night.  I have the photos it took but I do not know how to plug the still night photos into editing software to see it in action.  It recorded for a few hours at least maybe more before battery ran out.  It will be fun to watch if I can highlight the stars...at least to see the weird flashes like lightning.;37.0015;-90.9956
