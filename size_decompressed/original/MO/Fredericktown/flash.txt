Blinking white light travels short distance, disappears.;2015-05-02 21:00:00;10 minutes;Blinking white light travels short distance, disappears. Observed a white, blinking light while looking towards the western horizon about 9:30 in the evening. I was out in the yard enjoying a small bonfire with my husband.  I saw a single blink and then there was a two or three second delay followed by another blink of this light.   The second blink occurred a distance away from where I saw the first, as if it were travelling in an eastern direction coming towards my location.  One more blink followed a few seconds later and in a spot slightly further away than the last, again, as though it were travelling towards us.  Then the blinking stopped all together.  This lasted about 10 seconds total.   I kept my eye in this area of the sky for at about three minutes and even looked in the approximate line of travel and didn’t see the light again.  It was like the light was turned off or whatever was creating the light disappeared completely.   Approximately five minutes after that sighting, I kept looking in a western direction but scanned over towards the north, then saw one blink while looking in that direction.  Again I kept looking for several minutes in this area of the sky, but didn’t see any more blinking like that there…however an obvious jet did fly over coming from the east with red and white blinking lights that were more “strobe like” with no long pauses between, like the blinking I’d seen earlier.   Additionally there was jet sound with the plane while there was no sound when I saw the mysterious blinking. I tried to point out the first set of lights to my husband, but he didn’t spot the final blink despite looking in that direction.;37.4906;-90.3362000000001
