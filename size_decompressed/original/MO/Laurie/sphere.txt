3 orange spheres in linear formation over Lake of the Ozarks;2010-08-01 22:15:00;3 minutes;3 orange spheres in linear formation over Lake of the Ozarks On a boat, heading downstream on Osage, passing 52 mile marker, and heading south, we observed 3 spheres south heading north.  Spheres were in diagonal linear formation and held the formation as they approached. As they reached approximately 75 degrees above us, the spheres broke formation and lights faded out as they separated and moved away.  Top sphere broke to the east, trailing two broke to the west and faded as they continued turn toward south. I did not observe the eastbound sphere after the break.  Spheres were orange in color with no other lights visible.  No sounds were heard.  The sky was clear, stars were visible, and the moon had not yet risen.;38.2032;-92.8344
