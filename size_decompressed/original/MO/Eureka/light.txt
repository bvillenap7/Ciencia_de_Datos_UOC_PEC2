After the terrible Skyway accident at Six Flags Over Mid-America where a gondola fell off the line and killed two people and injured one, they closed the park and everyone starting leaving the parking lot.  The weather turned bad quickly as huge dark clouds rolled in and covered the sky like something out of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. We were listening to the radio, stuck in traffic leaving the park, when the news at the top of the hour reported that police officers had pursued an object in the sky (nearby where we were) that they described as big as a house.  This spurred my mother to mention that she had just seen a ball of light in the sky.  She said it streaked down at us then veered away.  She dismissed it as balled lightning (which she had never seen, it just sounded logical.)   At the time, I thought all of these incidents were very strange, so I filed them away in my memory.   Recently, I was looking at a Six Flags website which mentioned the incident, so with the date in hand, I checked some UFO databases.  I found the incidents listed on this website and thought I should add our report to it.;38.5159000000002;-90.6353000000007
