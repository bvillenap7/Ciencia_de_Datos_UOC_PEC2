Large triangle (football field size) craft moving north fairly low & fairly slow. ((anonymous report));2015-11-01 21:05:00;1 minute;Large triangle (football field size) craft moving north fairly low & fairly slow. I saw what looked like a 100meter long craft flying fairly low & slow above me. The sky was black, but I could vaguely tell that it was moving.  It was moving north. It was a large triangle shape with white lights on each tip.  I decided to share my experience especially after seeing two other reports the same night & time from towns directly south of me.  I was outside at Six Flags (nobody was around as the park was closed) when I saw it.  Very surreal.  It didn't really hear any noise, but I at least had a feeling of movement and a low sound (possibly infrasound?).
