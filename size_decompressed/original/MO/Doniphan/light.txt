UFO?;2002-04-11 22:00:00;Aprox 1 minute;UFO? 3 of us were outside on deck at 10:00pm, clear night, heard what sounded like thunder way off in the distant. A line of light appeared in the sky above the pasture just across from the deck for which we were on.  There were 3 lights total in a straight line/split into 3rds (- - -).  The lights were brite orange and became brighter prior to its disappearance. This sighting appeared out of no where and left in a flash.  I have never in my life experienced such a thing. It was really beautiful experience.;36.6482;-90.8094
