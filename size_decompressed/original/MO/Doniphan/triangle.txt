Triangular shaped UFO flies over observer's vehicle at relatively low altitude.;2001-07-02 22:00:00;1 minute;Triangular shaped UFO flies over observer's vehicle at relatively low altitude. While traveling south on a rural highway, I noticed two red lights in the distance.  At first, I believed the lights were mounted on a tower.  The lights did not blink, so I thought it was an airplane.   Then this flying object made a movement, swift and swooping like the shape of an inverse rainbow.  I knew then that the object was not an airplane.  I noticed the object then began to move east toward my vehicle.  The driver could no longer see the object but I could as I leaned out the window.   Above the vehicle, I saw a triangle-shaped UFO with red lights at each corner.  The triangular shape was not equilateral but more obtuse (i.e. much longer than it was wide).  I saw the craft fly directly over.  The UFO was so black it made the night sky seem a dark blue.   I could no longer see the craft once it passed over me and to the east.
