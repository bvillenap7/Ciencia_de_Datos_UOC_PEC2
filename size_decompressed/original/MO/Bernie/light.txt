Orange ball of light moving over Bernie, Mo.;2010-07-04 21:00:00;3 minutes;Orange ball of light moving over Bernie, Mo. Orange ball of light moving across the sky from south to north with no sound.  Clear skies.  Moved at a normal speed but was no higher than a small spray plane.  Had no blinking lights.It moved over the city in which we live.  The light from ground view was the size of a tennis ball.  We thought it was a firework at first, we were facing south and it kept coming north and went right over us and our house.   We watched till it faded out of sight.;36.6764;-89.9863

Thinking this was the same thing I had witnessed I begin taking it and although it never got closer I got excellent footage I was a light moving in a way that it could not be any man made craft and I feel that is important that this is what they did and I do have a video of what I saw.;36.6764;-89.9863
