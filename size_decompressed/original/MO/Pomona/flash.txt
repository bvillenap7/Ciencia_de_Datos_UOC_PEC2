It was a cold, clear night with bright stars visible.  I caught a flash of light to my left in the south east just above the trees.  It started as a pinpoint and then a bright flash, then nothing.  Then it would appear again in a random pattern.  Sometimes to the left, then the right, then up, then down behind the trees.  I had seen such a light about 1 month ago just as I was about to arrive at my turnoff to my house. It was more to the north and a very bright flash and as suddenly gone.  I am a paraprofessional and my husband is employed in the trailer business and is also a Beef Farmer.  About 7 years ago, I also saw, again when I was nearly home, a bright, enormous, saucer shaped object hovering over a cleared field to my left.  It was a bright, moonlight night and I rolled the truck window down to make sure I wasn't seeing a reflection.  It wasn't and it was as big as a fotball field and absolutely silent.  I slowed down almost to a stop but I was too scared to completely stop. It  was like nothing I had ever seen before.;36.846;-91.9179
