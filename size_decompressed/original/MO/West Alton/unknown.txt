low flying light  hovering in sky;2008-05-05 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;low flying light  hovering in sky I was inside my house, walking into our bedroom to feed and change our baby, and I was also talking on the phone to my mom when I noticed a bright light in  the southwest sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane, then I figured it must be a planet since it didn't move.  It seemed to hover for at least a minute, then dipped down below the tree line and wavered in a back and forth and up and down motion for a minute or so more.  I got off the phone so I could pay better attention to this thing, and as I watched it, it emerged from the trees, just below tree level, I would estimate about 300 yards away, and came across the field towards the window where I was standing and looking.  I was so startled that I yelled and shut the blinds immediately.  I went to the living room to tell my husband what I saw, so we both went outside to look, but by that time it was gone.;38.8703;-90.2444
