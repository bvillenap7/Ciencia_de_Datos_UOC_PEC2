I was grilling some pork chops outside and in the corner of my eye I saw a red light in the sky.  I looked into and saw what looked like an air balloon on fire.  I pulled out my phone and started to record it moving.  It was moving slowly across the sky a little bit faster than a plane would.  It continued to the left and I saw it move over towards a star pattern that was completely red.   As it moved to the top of the pattern they all formed into a vertical line.  They proceeded to disappear from top to bottom.;36.6984;-93.1115
