Fire in the sky.;2014-01-16 19:00:00;3 minute;fire in the sky I went outside on my porch to have a cigarette.  I always look to the stars.  I noticed a bright orange star or a planet south west to a bright blue star that i look at every night.  Then i realized it was twinkling, planets don't twinkle (to my knowledge).  So i kept watching it, seemed to get brighter.   As i put out my cigarette I looked back again to notice it was now almost parallel to the blue star.  I tell my boys to come look, at this point it was very obvious it was moving, looked to be moving straight upand getting faster, passed the star and went into the clouds.   No strobe lights like aircraft would have.   And best way to describe color is fire orange.;36.6984;-93.1115
