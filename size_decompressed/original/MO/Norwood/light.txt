Blinding light, hovering, moving and disappearing;2009-11-09 22:00:00;2 minutes;Blinding light, hovering, moving and disappearing I recently saw a UFO hovering over two towers that blink red lights on West 60 coming home to Springfield Missouri.  There were no stars that night due to cloud cover.  The object was a blinding white light not moving at all.  There were no standard blinking lights on it like normal aircraft and it was brighter then anything ive ever seen. It must have been as big as a 747.   As it continued to hover it suddenly changed direction and began to slowly turn hover at an angle upward.  This caused a reflection from the craft on the clouds that made my stomach churn.  As it turned and the light reflected off the cloud it was clear this was no normal craft.   As it began the same flight path it suddenly vanished.  At first I thought it went behind a cloud but I still would have been able to see that bright light through the cloud,  I swear it just disappeared.  Now since about 30 minutes earlier I had passed through the town of Norwood Missouri, I wasn't surprised that I saw a UFO,  Norwood is a really famous spot for sightings/cow mutilations.   Ive seen about 9 UFO's in my life and I swear I saw another one last night.  I know more people had to have seen it, the light was so bright.;37.0687;-92.4082
