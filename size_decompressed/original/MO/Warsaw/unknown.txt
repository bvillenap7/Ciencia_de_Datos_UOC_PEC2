AT THE TIME INDICATED I WAS DOING MY ALMOST DAYLY THING OF TAKING MY DOG FOR A WALK.I WAS JOGGING ALONG THE LEVY ABOVE LAKE WHEN I FIRST SAW THE LIGHTS,IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU SEE SOMETHING BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY REGISTER AS SOMETHING THAT IS UNUSAL.THE LIGHTS APPEARED AS BRIGHT FLASHES OFF TO MY RIGHT,I STOPPED AND SCANNED THE SKY IN THAT DIRECTION THIS IS WHEN I NOTICED THE TWO AIRCRAFT AT THAT TIME THEY WRE TURNING AND HEADING BACK IN THE DIRECTION THAT I HAD JUST SEEN THE FIVE FLASHES OF LIGHT.WHEN THEY THE AREA ONE AIRCRAFT PROCEEDED TO CLOSE ON THE AREA WHILE THE OTHER BEGAN A SLOW TIGHT CIRCLE JUST OUTSIDE THE AREA.AS THE OTHER AIRCRAFT APPROACHED THE AREA WHERE THE LIGHTS HAD APPEARED IN MY PROFEARELL VISION.AS HE CLOSED ON THAT AREA IS WHEN IT OCCOURED AGAIN THIS TIME I WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY AT IT,THE REASON THAT I SAY THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING LIKE LANDING LIGHTS ON A VERY LARGE CRAFT I COULD ALMOST MAKE OUT AN OUTLINE AS THE LIGHTS FLASHED ACROSS. THE AIRCRAFT GAVE EXCELLANT PERSPECTIVE AS TO THE SIZE OF THE LIGHTS THEY LOOKED TO BE ALMOST AS LARGE. AS I SAID ABOVE THEY CAME ON SEQUENTALLY DIRECTLY AFTER THE AIRCRAFT'S PASSING. ALMOST AS IF THEY WERE WARNING IT NOT TO GET ANY CLOSER.I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE WITNESSED THISBUT I SURE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW!!!;38.2404;-93.3849
Floating lights on game camera;2011-10-07 20:45:00;30 seconds;Floating lights on game camera On the night of October 7th at 8:45 this video was shot on a game camera I have set out for deer.. This is my 2nd year of having game camera's out and I have NEVER seen anything like this on them before..  I am curious to what it might be..  You might  have to adjust the brightness to see the lights good..  I am an average person with NO UFO experience and have NEVER experienced this before..;38.2404;-93.3849
