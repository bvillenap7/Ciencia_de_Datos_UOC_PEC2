I was traveling home on Highway 7 and as I was just about to cross the Long Shoals Bridge over Truman Lake,  I saw 3-5 elongated very bright white lights low in the eastern sky.  They appeared to be on a rectangular or cylinder-shaped object.  It was visible for only several seconds and then disappeared.  Shortly after crossing the bridge, I again saw the lights which appeared almost as flames on a long, thin object.  The object did not appear to be moving.  It went totally black within a few seconds and then disappeared.  There were no clouds in the sky, or noise of passing helicopters or planes.;38.2404;-93.3849
