I live on 24 country acres. I went out back to dump out gray water about midnight. When I looked back up at the night sky --mostly clear -- I saw two, light-flashing rectangles opposite of each other -- and flashing alternately. It was so strange I just stared asking myself what it could be as far as a logical explanation. It was close, the object -- maybe 200 feet off the ground. Total absolute silence. It hung there, those two rectangular lights just flashing. I said hi, so to speak. It began to move, fairly slow -- I think from the sky that was blocked and the way the lights were positioned, it was a curved triangular shape. What was really eerie was the silence -- also the way it moved, gliding -- nothing, absolutely nothing I've ever seen before. And it was close -- either extraterrestrial, black ops or innerterestrial -- or something not explained. If whoever, whatever it was, I'd kind of like it to return. It's really scary, but I'm also very curious.;38.8142;-94.0482
