Very bright light traveling slowly from West to East then shooting straight upward;2006-04-22 22:00:00;2 minutes or so;Very bright light traveling slowly from West to East then shooting straight upward About 10 PM on night given my husband and I went out to walk our dogs.  We were watching off to the West because there was an amazing lightning show going on.  Then, from the same area I spotted a bright light that looked like a star only it was brighter than any star or planet I had seen before and it was actually lower than even a small airplane would normally fly.  We were walking, so I stopped to look at it better and thats when I realized it was moving.  I pointed at it and my husband seen it also.  It was coming towards us from the West. It did not dim or brighten any and it did not make a sound.  We watched it as went right over the top of us and it was moving slowly.  Slower than an airplane but not as slow as a blimp.  I would say it was flying a little lower than you would see a small plane fly.  We watched it until it got just to the East of us and were just getting ready to walk again when the light stopped.  It just stopped in mid air.  It never dimmed, it was still very bright.  Then it shot straight up and traveled about 2 seconds, then stopped again.  Then we watched it as it very very slowly dimmed out and disapeared. I never seen a shape because the light was so bright.  It definately was not something on fire or something falling. It had amazing control.  Also there was absolutely no sound. Thank you;39.2189;-93.0506
