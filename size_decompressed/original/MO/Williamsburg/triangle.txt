Bright flash of light lit up our entire yard;1993-06-15 12:00:00;45 minutes;Bright flash of light lit up our entire yard In the summer of 1993 , my wife and I  bought a farm just two miles north of Hwy 70 in Williamsburg , Missouri. One night in July ( could of been June) we happened to notice some sort of craft hovering over the tree line due east of our house . The exact distance was hard to estimate and could of been one mile away. I had a powerful set of binoculars at the time and focused as best as I could on the object trying very hard to steady my hand . The craft was dark in color and all I could make out were lights, both green and red, blinking in a sequenced triangle pattern. What ever it was slowly moved from left to right several times but never changed alltitude . I was so convinced it was a UFO that I called the williamsburg police department and reported the incident . After I had hung up the phone I noticed the UFO had disappeared from where it had hovered for about 30 minutes. I was in the process of telling my wife about my conversation with the Sheriffs office when a blinding light flashed directly above our two story house. The light was so bright that the yard lit up like it was day time . There was not a cloud in the sky that night,  no chance of rain , and the flash of light was brighter than lighting . My wife and I became a little frightened at that point because there was no sound like lightning and if there was no lightning just exactly what caused the flash of light.  Has anyone else experianced anything like this? ((NUFORC Note:  Date  in June 1993 is approximate.  PD));38.8902;-91.7699
