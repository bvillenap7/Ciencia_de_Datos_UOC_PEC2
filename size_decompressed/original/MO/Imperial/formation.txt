cluster of lights in wheel shape with center hub light largest.;2010-10-14 06:15:00;20 minutes;cluster of lights in wheel shape with center hub light largest. October 14, 2010 at 6:15 A.M. Central time. I saw a cluster of orbs in a circular fashion.  The center orb, or light, was the largest not necessarily the brightest. There were at least 8 smaller orbs, or lights surrounding the center light in a circular fashion. The cluster was stationary in the sky for at least 20 minutes.  The center light pulsed but the outer lights did not.  As daylight came I could still make out the lights but lost them as dawn broke. There location in my opinion may have been in the Kansas City Missouri area.  My location is south of St. Louis Missouri about 18 miles.  The location on the horizon would have been at around 9 o'clock and it was west and south of St. Louis.  That's why I figure it was over Kansas City Missouri area and for some reason I'm thinking they were that many miles away. I couldn't get an image with my phone.  When I went back out after dawn they were still in the same position.  Then as I said as daylight became brighter I couldn't see them anymore, I don't believe they left, I think I was just no longer able to make them out.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999
