3 cluster balls of light - UFO;2010-10-07 23:30:00;2+hours;3 cluster balls of light - UFO Very high in our south east sky we saw at 11:30 pm on October 7 2010 what appeared to be a very bright planet until we noticed it was moving slowly.  At first glance it looked like it was a single star but as we started observing it was actually 3 bright balls of light with 3d rays of light in all directions.  You could see all the rays and where they ended, kindof like if you were to draw a picture of a sun with a bunch of sun rays.  The movement was slight side to side then stop and then hover in cirlce at same time it was moving forward.  It appeared to be bigger or closer than a planet or star.  We video taped this event with our home camcorder.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999
Redish glowing round light which suddenly disappeared;2013-07-13 22:00:00;40 seconds;Redish glowing round light which suddenly disappeared My house is located at the top of a hill on a private road at the edge of a state park.  While sitting in the driveway with two friends about 10 pm on Saturday, July 13, my female friend said, “What is that?”   Coming from the southeast over the valley was a bright reddish glowing object, about the level that a small plane would fly at, and traveling at the speed of a small plane, traveling on a southwest path some distance away.  My male friend got out his binoculars which have excellent optics and looked at the object.  He said he had no idea what it was - no wings, no noise, just a round glowing light.  I looked at it through the binoculars and saw only a bright orange-red glow.  She looked at it and saw a tint of blue besides the red.  We all heard no noise, saw only a round glowing object with no wings or discernible features. He watched it the longest and said it turned yellowish and disappeared.  She and I could not see it at that point because our view was blo! cked by trees.  She commented that there is no place to land around here.  He insisted it did not land it was still traveling when it turned yellowish and disappeared. I have not seen anything like this before, and it definitely was not a Chinese lantern since we all viewed it through excellent binoculars and saw no flame or any features. I am in my 60s and my two friends are middle 50s.  All of us have technical backgrounds.  I do not drink and my friends were not drinking that evening.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999
