Reddish orange fireball in sky in Imperial MO;2011-07-09 21:30:00;15 seconds;Reddish orange fireball in sky in Imperial, MO Around 9:30 pm on both July 4th and July 9th, my husband and I saw what appeared to be a fireball that was moving from south to north in a straight horizontal line.  The object went horizontal for a period of maybe 6-7 seconds toward our location then went vertical into the sky until it disappeared.  It seemed to be as high in altitude as a jet would be. When the object was going horizontal, it made a 90 degree turn going vertical at what seemed to be a high rate of speed into the atmosphere to the point that we could not see the object any longer. There was no sound.  The color of the object was a reddish orange single orb. The events on both nights were exactly the same in time, location, appearance and movement.  The event took a matter of maybe 15 seconds each time.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999

The sky was blue with a lot of scattered fluffy white clouds, temperature was warm for December-in the 50's. All of a sudden I saw two reddish orange round objects.  They kind of looked like fireballs, but were traveling together.  They came down from the sky, hovered, moved to the left together-then shot back up into the clouds.  I was just sitting there while driving, with my mouth open in astonishment!  I wondered what the other people thought if they just saw the same thing I had!  It definitely did not look like anything I had ever seen before, in broad daylight.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999

About 15 minutes after that we sat and watched about ten to twelve jets fly across the sky leaving white smoke streaks everywhere.  I truly believe that we where not the only ones who saw it, so I hope others report if they saw anything.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999
