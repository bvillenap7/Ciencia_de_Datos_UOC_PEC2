I was going out to my car, and noticed bright lights in the sky. I first thought they were stars.  Then I noticed they were moving quickly heading North/West.  They looked like large bright orange lights.  They were in large groups at first, then the groups started to get smaller. I grabbed my cell phone and took a short minute and a half video.  Then I woke my wife to show her.  We watched for a few minutes until they started coming one at a time.  They all followed the same course except the very last one.  The last one looked like it was off course, or separated from the others.  Then all of the sudden, the very last one just disappeared.  Then about 5 minutes later, a helicopter flew the exact path they did, but in a South/East direction.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999
