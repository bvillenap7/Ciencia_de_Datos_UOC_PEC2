Sitting on the deck behind my house I noticed something in my peripheral flying above me coming from the North and heading South directly over my house.  I was sitting facing North looking at the back of my house, I didn't get a great view of it because I was turning to see it directly over me I was trying to grab my glasses at the same time.  It was Triangle shaped or more like a flying wing and it flew low and completely silent over me and vanished over the tree line behind me.  I had thought it might be higher in the sky and much larger but judging by the way it appeared over my roof and then vanished over the tree line I knew my inclination that it was very low was likely accurate.  It was white but glowing almost like it had a fog around it or like some sort of ghostly apparition.  I had my phone in my lap, but it happened so fast and it was so low that it came in and then out of my visual space in less than 10 seconds.  Here’s where I’ll put my though! ts about what I think but I can’t necessarily confirm size and speed.  I fly drones, so I believe the height of this thing was about 150’ high or under and from that height I’m sort of guessing but it must have been at least 20’ from wing tip to wing tip and was moving at approx. 40mph.  There was another entry on your National UFO reporting site for Missouri from 11/26/2018 in Columbia, Missouri that explained almost the exact same thing but they saw it from more of a distance away than I was able too.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999
