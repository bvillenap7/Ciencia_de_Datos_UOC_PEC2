4-5 ft. circular UFO floating about 45 feet of the ground seen above house.;2005-07-14 10:30:00;15 minutes;4-5 ft. circular UFO floating about 45 feet of the ground seen above house. I was driving towards my girlfriend's house at aproximately 10:15 when I saw a long strip of bright lights in the sky, changing colors from blue to a dark purple. It was aprox. 4-5 ft. circumference and about four feet thick. I pulled off the road and into a subdivision to get a better look and saw that it was directly above a house, perhaps fifteen feet from the roof (the house was aprox. thirty feet high). In what I suppose was the front of the craft were two lights and in the back was one longer strip of lights, both changing colors in synch with each other. The craft was completely silent and slightly swayed from left to right.  Furthermore, another car drove past on the same road that I had been driving on, and as it drove up the hill its head lights reflected off of the UFO revealing metal panels. The car slowed down, but did not stop. I was too scared at the time to contact the house owners and instead drove to get my girlfriend to see what she could make out of the situation. However, when I returned with her, it was gone. I should also note that I was about 60 minutes from any airpot or military station.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999
Large round white ball flying across the sky super fast.;2013-05-22 19:00:00;5 seconds;Large round white ball flying across the sky super fast. A floating white circle that made no noise but was rather large shot across the sky at a very fast rate of speed.  No engine sounds could be heard and the object moved in a perfect straight line.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999
