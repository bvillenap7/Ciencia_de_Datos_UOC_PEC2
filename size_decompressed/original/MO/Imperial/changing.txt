Lights and changing shapes with one master light;2018-09-14 05:45:00;15 minutes;Lights and changing shapes with one master light My wife woke me up at 05:40 ecstatic over something outside.  We proceeded out to our driveway where we viewed a group of white orbs or lights moving in all different directions around one main orb or light. The movement was from southwest and moved in a north to northe east direction. At several points during the 15 to 20 minutes we noticed that the shape change from round to triangle and then back to round.  The smaller orbs or lights were moving erratically around the stationary  or very slow moving center orb or light. The moved at a very slow rate of speed in the direction of travel but the smaller orbs or lights moved extramly fast around the main orb or light creating the different shapes.  It only disappeared due to the sun coming up.;38.4072999999999;-90.4367999999999
