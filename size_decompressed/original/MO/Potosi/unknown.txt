I was driving along Hwy 8 heading West.   I was just about to Potosi, MO when I spotted something heading toward earth with a huge orage streak behind it.  At first I thought it was a jet,  but it was too large to be a jet.  It seemed to be a black object  with a huge amount of flames trailing behind it.   It was heading South.  I watched it for a good 4 minutes before I lost sight of it behind a very big group of clouds.  I was looking for it again and I caught sight of it as I passed by where I thought I might see it.  Noone else on the road seemed to notice it.;37.9509;-90.8407

Colored lights , red& blue flashing at the perimeters There is a bright light moving in an erratic pattern in the Southern sky, about 45 degrees from the horizon.   Initially sighted around 7:45, it darted straight-up, then at a straight angle to the left.   When others came out to look at it, the light still in the same sky and height , it looks to be moving, erratically, but within a narrow radius, somewhat circular pattern.  Using binoculars there are small flashes of red & blue lights flashing at the edge, or perimeter, of a circular shape.  My husband and I are retired medical professionals and live in a remote area between Potosi & Sullivan, Missouri.;37.9509;-90.8407
