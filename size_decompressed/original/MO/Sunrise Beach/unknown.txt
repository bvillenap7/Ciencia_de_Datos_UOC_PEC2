Little hairs raised all over your body. There were no noises of any wildlife.  The Stars in the sky wet changing shapes (the consultations were all turning into triangles), one of the brightest stars in the northern sky turned into a bright orange ball and floated  across the sky and went from being in space to just above the trees, and Then a figure that looked like a drone...it looked so small.  So i shined my flashlight at it. It dodged the light,  and in an instant it wasn't in space no more.  That too was just above the tree line.  It came towards us so fast it looked like it just swooped  down, but did it so fast,  like it was telling us to turn the light off. Then we seen little figures with yellow beaty eyes to really tall figures, standing in the tree line.  It looks looked like they ! were standing still,  but they were moving so fast.  All  you could do was freeze.  No matter how much you tried to move. Couldn't speak, move, nothing.  You couldn't think.  Then when you realize what is going on you are just standing there crying. That's when it all hits you.    What ever is in the sky, isn't  friendly.  They take your memories while they study you.  You are left in a daze for hours just staring. And the next day you don't remember it. We only know know the estimated time lapse from our security cameras.  We watched them the next day,  then all our data just disappeared.  We did nothing to it.  Hours  had passed.  We went outside at midnight,  came in at dawn. But it only seemed like it was less than an hour. To this day I am terrified to go outside by myself when is dark . Something is out there.;38.157;-92.7885
