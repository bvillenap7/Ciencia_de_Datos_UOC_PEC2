I saw a very bright object in the western sky that appeared to have segmented lights,  I asked my husband to look at it because it definitely was not a star or plane - it was hovering in the same spot.  My husband got his telescope and told me to get our neighbor. In the few minutes I was gone, my husband said the object turned bright red, went sideways left and  right and then dropped behind the treeline.  Within a few minutes, the object reappeared.  The three of us saw it turn red again and then it went in a north west direction. I didn't notice it again until Friday, May 29, 2010 evening (it appears about 8:30 PM and is gone bt 10 PM) I was sitting looking at the lake and there it appeared in the same place.  Saturday night my company saw it and there appeared to be much movement in the object.  It moves slowly up and down. I just got off the phone with Peter and I feel better knowing it is Venus.  I have been mesmerized by it and really needed to know what it was.  I didn't realize planets moved back and forth - appear quickly and then disappear. Thank you for listening.;38.157;-92.7885
