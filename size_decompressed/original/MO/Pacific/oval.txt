I first thought it was a firework that went astray, yet it kept going further and further.  The color was orange-red and it was moving very quickly across the sky moving from east to west.  It did change direction very quickly at least three times, but continued in its east to west migration.   I asked my wife to grab her phone and take a video, but by that time it was already over the horizon.  The light we saw was an oval orange light that did not resemble aircraft lights either helicopter or plane, and it moved much too quickly and changed direction too abruptly to be a normal aircraft.
