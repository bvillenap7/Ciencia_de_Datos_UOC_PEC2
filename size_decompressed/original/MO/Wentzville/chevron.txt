There were 4 benches about 2 feet off the ground on mounds so while my dad was talking to my teacher me and my mom layed in the middle of the memorial and looked up at the stars and about after 30 seconds of laying down a gigantic silver boomerang object appeared right over the memorial and hovered there and then started to slowly move forward and then accelerated at unearthly speeds and vanished instantly almost like hyperspace in star wars me and my mom looked everywhere and it was nowhere to be found.

Five dim blue chevron lights;2012-03-14 23:30:00;30 seconds;Five dim blue chevron lights It was late and a large group of my friends were sitting in a circle just talking. I decided to look up seeing as the stars were out bright and it was a clear night, when a very dim, but very distinct chevron figure flew across the sky, too fast for a plane to be moving. I blurted out Holy sh*t, look at that!, to which my quickest witted friend looked up and was just as astonished to catch the five dim lights moving across the sky at a rapid speed. Seeing as they were so dim I'm not completely sure if it was one ship with multiple lights or multiple ships synchronously moving.;38.8040000000001;-90.8534
Lights hovering low in a chevron shape across St. Louis metro area.;2017-10-17 20:20:00;30 minutes;Lights hovering low in a Chevron shape across St. Louis metro area. Around 8:20 PM my husband called me outside to view what he thought were planes flying closely together.  There were six white/yellow lights in the sky however, they appeared to be hovering stationary in the distance.  That was the first indication that they weren't planes.  Additionally, I've never seen planes travel so closely together in the form of a chevron.  Friends have reported (to me) seeing the same thing, at the same time in different parts of the St. Louis metro area.;38.8040000000001;-90.8534
