Stationary sphere obversed during storm and high winds;2011-07-03 14:00:00;30 seconds;Stationary sphere obversed during storm and high winds A very strong storm was moving through the area, with winds strong enough to shake our deck.  As we were watching the storm, we noticed a spherical object just underneath the fast-moving clouds.  The object was a brown or plum color, non-reflective, and remained perfectly still despite the very high winds.   Apparent size was about a fingernail at armâ€™s length and perhaps 30 degrees elevation.  Hard to judge the distance, my best guess would be about 200 yards apparently over a road that distance away.  That would put the size at less than 10 feet in diameter??  Though just under a very fast moving low cloud, the object was stationary and remained there until the clouds passed over it. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above.  We assume that the sighting occurred in 2011.  PD));38.8040000000001;-90.8534
