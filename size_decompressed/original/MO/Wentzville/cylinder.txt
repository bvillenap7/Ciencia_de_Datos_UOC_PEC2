Seamingly intelligent glowing pink cylinder.;2014-06-24 00:46:00;5 seconds;Seamingly intelligent glowing pink cylinder. Having a cigarette outside, I noticed a pink glowing cylinder about the size of a nunchuk handle.  It did a slow twisting spin, while moving left to right, shifting those movments within a foot or two in the air. It was as if this object knew I could see it, like a person doing a dance when no one was around and then being startled when caught.   It stopped its spinning twist, froze, then made a very rapid arch and flew behind my neighboring townhouse.   There was nobody on the roof of the town house, and diffenitly not a quadcopter as I own a few.   That night there was a large thunderstorm and there were trees taller than the townhouse giving foreground or a back drop if you will too lend me a very sharp view of this unknow object.;38.8040000000001;-90.8534
