It was odd.;2009-01-12 20:30:00;3 lights in triangel of s;It was odd. My wife pick me up from down the street from where we live. When I saw 3 orange lights in the sky in a triangle shape floating.It was very dark and there was low clouds,but the way it moved was not like anything I've ever seen before.When I first saw it it was hovering over a building about 100ft off the ground,then with no sound it started floating eastward and then vanished.I never saw the body of the ship,all I saw was the lights.It seemed like it was shrouded in clouds that moved with the craft.  It was very odd;38.8040000000001;-90.8534

I noticed this object, which I thought was a plane at first.  I was looking to see if it had moved.  Placing this object with another object to see if it was going farther away.  It just stayed in the same spot.  During the seventeen minutes of staring at this object I noticed bright green and white spots on the object and two bright lights, and what seemed to be moving up and down. I ran inside to grab binoculars, when I came back the object had moved about three miles more to the North West and farther away.  I looked at it through the binoculars and it was a triangular shape.  The triangle was outlined in bright green and the center was white.  The triangular object was very bright, neon almost.  It kept rotating, but stayed the same shape.  The object appeared to be spinning every few minutes. I went back inside to grab my phone, which took me about 30 seconds.  When I came outside the object was gone.  Nowhere in sight. I know what I saw, I can't grasp what I saw.  I researched any possibility of it being anything other than a UFO and found nothing.   Hoping someone else saw what I saw. Thanks.;38.8040000000001;-90.8534
Dark gray boomerang craft, no lights, gliding across Wentzville, MO, sky.;2014-02-18 20:50:00;15 seconds;Dark gray boomerang craft, no lights, gliding across Wentzville, MO sky.  Blended perfectly in the night sky, surprised I even noticed it.  I was standing outside with my dogs while they went potty before bed. The skies were so clear I was checking out all the pretty stars.  The movement caught my eye.  Hard to estimate size, since I would first have to estimate altitude…….but I’d say it was lower then an air plane.  Maybe a few hundred feet.  I viewedit for about 10-15 seconds it was traveling west then turned to the South, that’s when it disappeared.   It looked like it had a wing span, likely V shaped.  No lights what so ever.  It was dark gray in color.  No sound.  It was graceful……it glided utterly silently in the night. Wasn’t sure who to report it to.  I haven’t heard anything on the news, radio or internet.  It was so discreet, I now find myself thinking these things could really be out there.  A few of my friends think I’m crazy, and don’t believe me.  No one would see them unless they got luck like me. Creepy.  I did not feel in danger though, it was a very graceful movement. Does this sound like a military operation/practice??  Maybe a surveillance drone or something??;38.8040000000001;-90.8534
