Possible UFO fleet?;2008-10-18 17:30:00;10 mins;Possible UFO fleet? Wentzville, MO, from Quail Ridge Park at the SW corner of Hwy 70 and 40.   At approximately 5:30Pm CST, I was watching a couple of Hot Air balloons sink into a field and then rise up over the tree line traveling with the Wind from East to West.   As the second balloon traveled over my head I noticed a bright white dot in the background in a Southeasterly direction.  The white dot was high in the sky and appeared to be reflecting the sun.  I immediately assumed it may be another balloon. Upon further focus of my eyes against the clear blue sky absent of any clouds, I began to notice about 10-20 more white dots.  They did appear to be stars, so I stared at them to see if they were moving.  Some appeared to be close to one another, they were in no specific pattern just sort of scattered.  I believe I perceived some of them getting really close to each other and then moving back apart.  They all were relatively stationary, not moving in any one direction but sort of holding their position. I was at a dog park, my and some other dogs where barking at the hot air balloon, so I kept having to look away.  When I looked back up, each time, there were less and less until I could no longer see any of them.   As I left the park I could see no stars or white dots anywhere. 30 mins later, in St. Peters I observed 2 what I assume were military jets judging from the contrails flying in a SE to W direction.;38.8040000000001;-90.8534
