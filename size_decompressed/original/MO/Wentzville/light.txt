Bright Light;2003-11-16 18:15:00;3 seconds;Driving East north of Wentzville.  We noticed a very bright light traveling on an arc from 12:00 (due north) to 5:00 (sse).  We noticed the light shortly after it came into view from the north and watched it appx. three forths of the way across the arc before it disappeared.  The light did not dim or get brighter, it did not break up or change color from its original bright white color.  The ambient light level of the sky in this area is high, due to a large factory east of town.  Viewing stars in this area is usually difficult, thats what made this light different and attracted our attention.  We could see landing lights of aircraft lineing up for an east to west landing at lambert.  This light traveled perpendicular to those lights.  Possible meteorite?;38.8040000000001;-90.8534
Bright amber light dim to bright;2010-03-10 19:45:00;5 minutes;bright amber light dim to bright It was on Kohls parking lot that we observed these lights.  They were moving from south-east to north-west in a straight line one behind the other seperated by a space, four of them in the first group and the fifth and last about thirty seconds behind.                                                                                                                                                                   There was no sound that could be heard, and they had an amber colored light on the under side that was going from dim to bright, the light was about the same color as amber colored sodium street lights. I could not see any shape of them just the lights.  It was a cloudy over cast night, the were below the cloud cover.  Latitude 38.811582, longitude 90.880516;38.8040000000001;-90.8534
