Blue/white streak in Southern sky traveling East to West parallel to the horizon.;2005-04-04 03:00:00;3-4 seconds;Blue/white streak in Southern sky traveling East to West parallel to the horizon. I have reviewed your recent listings of UFO sighings in the hopes that someone else saw what I did on April 4.  It seems that someone did see this fireball in Nashville, TN the same night.  We live in a rural area about 50 miles west of St. Louis. I am 55 years old and a bookkeeper for my husband's business.  I'm not real sure about the time, I know my clock said 3:00 am but I can't remember if I had turned the clock forward in my bedroom since daylight savings time started that previous Saturday. I know it was a couple of nights before I remembered to change it. (One of the advantages to working from your home, I am not chained to my clock.)  I was having a hard time getting to sleep that night and was laying facing my window which faces the South. I saw a large blue/white streak going parallel to the horizon traveling through the sky from the East to the West at about the 2 o'clock position.  The Nashville report did not state the direction the object was traveling.  I have seen many meteor showers before and this was quite different. It didn't travel in a completely straight path - seemed so sort of wiggle slightly up and down and get slightly thinner and fatter along its path. It almost looked like it was an object tumbling slightly along. The width of the streak was quite a bit wider than the width of a normal meteor shower streak. (Maybe about the width of a pencil at arm's length.)  The object traveled very fast. It was only in the view of my window for approximately 2 to 3 seconds, but was so bright that it left a glowing blue trail behind it. I can remember seeing the entire length of its path, including its slight up and down movements for a second or two after it passed by. Normal meteors fade almost as quickly as they are seen. Unusual also was the fact that I don't recall seeing a meteor travel almost perfectly parallel to the horizon like this before.  My feeling is it was probably something like space junk re-entering the atmosphere. Hopefully that would be something easily checked out.;38.8040000000001;-90.8534
Three orange fireballs in Wentzville, MO.;2012-03-10 19:54:00;5 minutes;Three orange fireballs in Wentzville, MO. I was driving home, it was a very clear dark night.  I first saw one orange light hovering & thought it was a helicopter.   Then I saw two more.  One dissappeared behind some trees, one seemed to go stright up until it was gone & the third one stayed a couple of more minutes before it just fanished.

I went outside and seen a round fireball object going horizontally from north to south.  I called for my wife and at that time the object slowed its moving to the south and then turned west and eventually went out of site.  Should have used my phone to take a photo.;38.8040000000001;-90.8534
