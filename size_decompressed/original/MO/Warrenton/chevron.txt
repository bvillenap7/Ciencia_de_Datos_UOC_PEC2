White lights in a V shape traveling at a constant speed.;2008-11-21 20:10:00;2-3 min.;White lights in a V shape traveling at a constant speed. I observed what appeared to be one craft traveling in as easterly direction.  It was at least 6 bright white lights in a shallow V shape.  I had binoculars with me and could see the individual lights clearly, but could not make out the body of the craft.  It moved at a constant speed and did not appear to change direction or altitude.  There were no red and green strobes that you usually see on normal aircraft at night, just the white lights.;38.8055999999998;-91.1711999999996
SOLID OBJECT EMITTING A CLOUD AROUND IT;2019-10-05 03:55:00;15 seconds;SOLID OBJECT EMITTING A CLOUD AROUND IT It was a clear night and not a cloud in the sky north and northwest of us. To the South the sky was cloudy due to rain. As I was enjoying the stars, I noticed something traveling at the tree line that appeared to be a huge oblong shaped cloud from a distance. It was traveling about 30 miles per hour and as it reached the front of my house, I looked closer and noticed it was a solid object emitting smoke all over it as if it were trying to appear to be a cloud. The entire time not once did this object make not one noise in fact, it was very quiet and still when this flew by. I then said to my husband “what is that?!”, he turned around and watched it through the tree, when suddenly it made a hard left and we noticed a wing as it floated east, I quickly went inside frightened as I have never seen this before. My husband watched it disappear through a tree line behind our house and got a clearer view as it floated away, he claims it was chevron shaped. It had zero lights on it, and was like a dark charcoal gray inside of the cloud appearance. I really wish I would have had my phone to take a video, but this thing flew by so quick I did not have time to get my phone. We both lost sleep over this that night and spent hours researching what we saw.;38.8055999999998;-91.1711999999996
