bright green fireball with a stardust trail.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2009-11-12 01:35:00;5 SECONDS;bright green fireball with a stardust trail While patrolling the county myself and several other law enforcement officers witnessed an unexplainable large green light.  Possibly a meteor however it lit up the ground as bright as daylight.  It had a distinct green fireball and very long green dust trail behind it.  My cell phone lost service for a few seconds and when the service came back on I contacted the other deputies and city officers that were on duty and they advised me that they had seen it as well. While discussing the incident with another deputy his patrol vehicle unexplainably shut off.  Dispatch looked over the NASA website for information and found nothing.  Another off duty officer in the next county over advised he saw the flash as well at the same time- he was on the phone with another officer in our county that witnessed the event as well.
