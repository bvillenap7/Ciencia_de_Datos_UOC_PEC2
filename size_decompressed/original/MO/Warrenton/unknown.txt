My mom and I were out walking and as we looked up at the stars, we noticed a pinpoint, single white light moving across the sky at a fast speed.  We have both seen airplane lights in the night sky of the same size, but agreed that none ever moved at that speed.  We could not see the object that was the origin of the light since it was dark outside.  As the light moved across the sky further from us, it was harder to see the light, almost like the light was on the bottom of the object and the angle that we were viewing it at was obstructing our visual of the light.;38.8055999999998;-91.1711999999996
