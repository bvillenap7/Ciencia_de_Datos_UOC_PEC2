Solid white light object zig-zagging from west to east near Ozark, Mo.;2014-06-24 21:34:00;4 minutes;Solid white light object zig-zagging from west to east near Ozark,Mo While outside at 21:34 central time in rural Ozark, Mo, I noticed 3 air craft flying at I assume normal cruising altitude.  The air craft seemed to be flying west to southwest direction.  While observing the aircraft I noticed a solid white light (about the size of a star) heading from west to east.  I thought maybe it may be the ISS so I went into my house and grabbed my binoculars.   I went back outside and got the object into view with my binoculars. It still looked like a star as it was moving.   Then suddenly it stopped and went beck to the west for about 2 seconds.  Then it started to go east once again for a second or two.  It then stopped and went back to the west once again. It did this four times before it suddenly accelerated very fast toward east.  It was out of my sight in a matter of about 8 seconds.  Note:  Each time it stopped to go in the opposite direction it was with out hesitation.;37.0142;-93.1986
Lighted object in the daytime sky.;2019-08-29 19:45:00;6 minutes;Lighted object in the daytime sky. Noticed a bright white object in the daytime sky very high up while sitting on the deck.. Thought it was another jet, but it wasn't moving and much higher then they fly..  Then maybe a star but it didn't seen round..  Thought it might be the Space Station or a Satellite..   Got my Binoculars out and realized only part of it was reflecting the sunlight..   Tried to look at the unlighted part, but it was was a hazy shadow on the top and bottom..  Was unable tell what the shaded part of it looked like..  The lighted part was NOT round but long egg shaped..  Watched it for over 5 minutes..look away to say something to my wife and when I looked back up it was gone..Just gone..  I'm talking only 5 seconds..  I jumped up and tried to find it but NOTHING..  I know something was there because I watched it for so longâ€¦  Was going to try and get a picture on my phone but my wife was talking to our daughter and I never got the chance to..;37.0142;-93.1986
