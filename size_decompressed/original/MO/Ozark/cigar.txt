Clear blue sky,no wind,no sound,very large,and very wicked looking and lights on the second one.;1995-05-12 14:00:00;30 to 40 sec.;Clear blue sky,no wind,no sound,very large,and very wicked looking and lights on the second one. I had just gotten back to my truck from a long walk accross a long field. When I sat in the seat I had the strange feeling that I was being watch or that I shouldn't be there at that particular time.As I was looking around I saw this thing in the  sky,about a 35 degree angle to the groung.It was about the size  of a football field or maybe a little larger.It looked like a verry large plane but had no wings only a high tail fin.It was the color of bluish/grey,there were 9 large windows the size of which were about 30 feet wide and 100 feet tall.The nose of this thiing was very wicked looking as the nose extended 75 feet or more in front of it and shaped down tto a fine neddle point.I could see large bolts around the  ccockpit of 3 windows.There was no sound as it traveled at 30 mph.It was only tree top high.The sky was clear and blue.I obsurved it as it  went  across the  field of nearly tthree fourths a mile long.I felt like I was in  in another time period,very strange.I was not drinking.Or on any kind of drugs.Also in the year of 2000 on the way back from a  hunting trip I saw a craft of some sort just east of  Seymore  Missourithat came across the highway  at  500 am.It was the shape of a knee kicker that carpet layers use,It had a orange and greenish light on it's rear .It stopped in the  sky and then dissapeared,but didn't leave just  faded out.There  was no noise.It looked like to be the size of a  simi truck.
