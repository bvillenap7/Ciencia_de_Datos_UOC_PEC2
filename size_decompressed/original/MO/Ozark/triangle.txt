We were driving home after working all day along Highway 65.   We were about 5 miles south of Ozark when I noticed a triangle shaped craft with three lights on it flying south.  What caught my attention was how vibrant the color of the lights were.   They were green, blue, and red.  I have never seen lights on an airplane look so colorful.    We watched it fly over head from the moon roof in my vehicle.   There were two of us in the car.;37.0142;-93.1986
