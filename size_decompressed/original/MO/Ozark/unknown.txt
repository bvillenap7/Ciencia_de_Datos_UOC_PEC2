Bright fluttering flash.;2010-07-15 04:37:00;4 minutes;bright fluttering flash Dear Peter,                                                                                                 07-15-2014    I called you at 11:26 am central time to report a possible UFO.  I told you I saw the object at 05:37 am.  Actually it was 04:37 am central time when I first spotted the UFO.  I apologize for the miss information.   Here is my report you requested:   I am a amateur astronomer.  I am always looking at the shy.  If anything looks out of the ordinary I usually notice it right away.  I live just south east of Ozark, MO, in the country.  I drive a commercial vehicle.  After returning home from a short run to Oklahoma City, Ok.  I went outside on my deck to enjoy the cool temperature.  The skies were clear with a waxing moon.  The time was 04:37 am (central time).  My deck faces north east. Just to the left of my deck I have a tree on my property.  Without warning out of my left peripheral vision I saw for a split second a fluttering flash just above my tree.  I stepped back to see what it was.  There was nothing there.   Roughly 10 seconds later I saw the same fluttering flash to the left (approximately 2 full fist from) of where I originally saw it.  Then suddenly disappear once again.  I saw this repeat itself approximately 10 times before it faded away in the southern skies.   The object was approximately ten full moons up in the sky.  The object was going in the direction from north to south.  This lasted for about 4 minutes. The flash was whitish blue in color.;37.0142;-93.1986
