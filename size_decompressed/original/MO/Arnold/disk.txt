Circular with white light on underside and silent, low flying;2009-06-20 23:30:00;1 minute;Circular with white light on underside and silent, low flying On Saturday night, 6/20/09, at approximately 11:30 pm, I was sitting outside on my deck having a cigarette and saw a bright light in the sky.  It was white light, bright on the bottom of the craft, but the light was not radiating downward.  It seemed be flying too low to be an airplane, and as it approached (from the southeast), it was about the height of a traffic helicopter, but it was shaped like disc and larger than a helicopter. All I could make out was the bright white light on the bottom, but I could see that it was circular in shape and had a dome on the top which was not lighted.  As it neared my subdivision, it was definitely too large to be a helicopter, but it was also silent.  There were no noises last night outside, not even the hums of air conditioning units.  I waited about a minute to see if it was going to come closer or make a noise, and then it took a northerly direction and went over the house, out of sight. I found it strange that it was flying so low for its size and that it was silent.  We are near Scott AFB, Illinois, and planes often pass over but always make a sound of some sort.  I did not wake my husband to come and see and I was afraid to run to the front of the house and keep looking for it. One other thing we are dogsitting this weekend and the dog was out on the deck with me when I saw this object.  When the dog saw it, it ran to the sliding glass door to be let inside.  I let the dog in and sat there for about another minute. Iâ€™ve never reported anything like this, but since I did not hear of any other reportings on the local St. Louis news stations, I wanted to report it somewhere else to see if others saw what I saw.   I am a 50-year old female, married with one child, and I am a business manager at a major university in St. Louis.;38.4525483134914;-90.3318194444446
Object viewing from above.;2019-04-02 17:00:00;5 minutes;Object viewing from above. I went to my car in the parking lot at the local school that sits at a higher elevation than the surrounding area.  I had to retrieve items I had forgotten to get as election judge that day.    The sun was low on the horizon & the sky above was very dark.  As I looked towards the East I saw a disk that was stationary in the sky with red, blue and green flashing lights, not wavering or making a sound.  I estimate it was 400 ft. above ground.   I watched as long as I had time thinking it was a helicopter but, this looked like nothing like that for it had a reflective surface.  Very unusual experience.;38.4525483134914;-90.3318194444446
