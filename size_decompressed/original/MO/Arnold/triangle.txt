I was at a neighbors house in their backyard, we notices what appeared to be 3 small orange lights in the sky that were formed into a triangular shape, it was off in the distance to the north west and seemed to be fairly high up.  There was no cloud cover out.;38.4525483134914;-90.3318194444446
Multiple UFO identified late evening in Arnold Missouri, exhibited no sound, moving in sync with eachother, multiple orbs, triangle;2012-06-01 20:30:00;5 minutes;Multiple UFO identified late evening in Anrold Missouri, exhibited no sound, moving in sync with each other, multiple orbs, triangle On the night of June 1st 2012 in Arnold Missouri sometime between 8:30pm and 10:00pm there were several UFOs witnessed by myself, my girlfriend, and 4 neighbors. The sighting first started with one object that was pointed out by my neighbor.  It looked like a helicopter that had 3 different lights blinking on the back, middle, and front, all blinking randomly.  We had thought it might have been a helicopter on fire.  It had a somewhat long oval shape and it made no sound. While we were observing the first object, my girlfriend, neighbor, and his mother accompanied me to the middle of the street to get a better view (because there was tree obstruction).  Once we got to the middle of the street we saw another set of objects (3) moving from left to right at the same speed and keeping the same distance from each other.  These objects however did not seem to be as close to us as the first object. At this time the rest of the neighbors came out, and more objects kept coming into view. I wasn't sure if they were suddenly appearing or have been traveling for some time as the treeline was still obscuring some of the view.  The objects all had a white with orange tint to them.  They still seemed to have a blinking type of flickering to them in some way (similar to the first object sighted).  The objects all seemed to be independent of each other, but noticed near the end of the sighting ( where my video starts) one object pattern had the classic triangle shape.  It moved also at the same speed as the other objects. The objects all seemed to have suddenly just went out at around the same area in the sky as they kept passing from left to right. (not sure of the cardinal directions)   No flickering, or fading, just suddenly gone.  However each light seemed to disappear right after one another. (which makes me think the triangle shape was not one craft)   The sighting lasted for about 5 minutes.   There was no sound. I cannot determine the height of the objects, but it seemed to be around the same altitude as any other normal aircraft. (which prompted me to think the first object was a helicopter as I am used to seeing lights in the sky at this distance with sound and the usual light patterns of normal aircraft.)    I have a somewhat decent video capture from my iPhone 3G of the event that lasts approx 1:34 min.  I will be emailing this right away.;38.4525483134914;-90.3318194444446
