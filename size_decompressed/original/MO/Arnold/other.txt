Static UFO deploying multiple UFO 'Scouts'?;2012-01-04 18:30:00;about 2 hours;Static UFO deploying multiple UFO 'Scouts'? This was very odd.  My family and I were shopping in Gravois Bluffs (Feton,MO) and on our way home (about 6:30PM) we noticed in the sky many blinking lights in small groups in static formation (i.e. series of 3-5 lights in one area, not moving, but multiple groups).  As I watched these groups of blinking lights I then noticed lights deploying from those area one at a time.  Once deployed from those areas, they then took flight and then looked like normal airplanes at night (white/red lights).  The 5 or 6 deployed planes scattered and seemed to 'scout' the Fenton and Arnold areas.  When I arrived home (Arnold, MO), we still saw the planes flying around.  Then one came flying over our house fairly low.  This is when I started to get a little scared.  The plane was low enough to see the formation of the red/white lights.  The craft had 3 white lights in a triangular formation  with a flashing red light in the center.  There was no tail light.  It sounded li! ke a prop plane but for as low as it was, it should have been much louder.  After it passed over I then noticed another craft (same with white/red lights) hovering further south and at a much higher altitude. . but it was not moving.  It remained stationary.  After seeing all this, I started to feel very uncomfortable, and then went inside pretending I saw nothing.  Then, at about 1:00AM, I heard the loudest most annoying humming droning sound ever (as if 'something' very large was hovering nearby.  The hum echoed through the town and I never saw anything. . . but the noise was very clear.  Needless to say, I did not get much sleep last night.  If I see something activity again tonight, I'll have my phone ready to take pics.  Have  there been any similar reports?

Small light seen traveling south, then disappears.;2015-11-30 21:00:00;2 minutes;Small light seen traveling south, then disappears. Happened when I was taking my dogs for a walk.  I was looking up towards the west and saw a tiny light, about the size of what a star would be.  This small light was hard to see, but it was steadily moving southbound.  From my point of view, the object probably moved south about the distance of my hand if I held it up.   As it continued south, it kept getting harder and harder to see.  Eventually I lost track of the object, or could no longer see it.  It looked as though whatever it was must have been very far away.  No blinking lights, no noise, just a small light moving across a small section of the sky.;38.4525483134914;-90.3318194444446
