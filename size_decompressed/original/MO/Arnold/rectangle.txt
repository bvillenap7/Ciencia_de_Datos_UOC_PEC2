2 gigantic crafts with dim red lights in Arnold, MO.;2014-10-18 22:00:00;5 minutes;2 gigantic crafts with dim red lights in Arnold, MO. Driving home from the grocery store with my two children.My son (8 years old) noticed it first, asking me what was in the sky.  I looked up and saw a series of dim red lights that appeared to make a gigantic rectangle.  I pulled over to get a better look and it became obvious that the hovering lights were actually one unit.  i knew this because they moved in sync.It seemed like I could almost see the craft as it came a little closer. It gracefully went straight up in the air and disappeared.  During this time I was noticing a second craft following towards it from the Noth east.  It looked the same, but I couldn't see it as well because of the tree lines. In relevance to where this happened, I was on Richardson Rd in Arnold, MO, approaching the highway 55 acceleration ramp.  The crafts were above Home Depot and Defense Mapping.  I would say that the crafts were every bit as big as a football field, if not bigger.  This was a positive sighting.   Me and my kids watched in disbelief for roughly 5 minutes.  I came straight home to Google it because I'm sure that we are not the only people to see this.  That is when I found this site;38.4525483134914;-90.3318194444446
