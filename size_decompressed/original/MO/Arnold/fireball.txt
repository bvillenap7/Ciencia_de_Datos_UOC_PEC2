Spotted a bright orange, burning fireball heading northeast.;2015-07-26 21:47:00;3 minutes;Spotted a bright orange, burning fireball heading northeast. At 9:47 CDT Sunday, July 26, 2015, my wife and I had just sat down to watch television.  We reside in Arnold, MO, approximately 25 miles south of downtown St. Louis.   The windows on the back of our home face north.  The ceilings are 18’ tall and the windows are floor to ceiling.   As soon as I sat down, I looked out the top window and noticed a bright orange object in the sky that almost appeared to be on fire.  From where we are, we can see the flight path to Lambert International Airport.  This was definitely not an aircraft.   This object appeared to be the size of a distant planet.  It was moving in an upward motion, from the southeast to the northwest.  It stayed in the sky for approximately 2 ½ - 3 minutes and then disappeared into the clouds.   My wife called her sister, who lives next to us, and told her to go on her deck to see the object.  She also witnessed what we saw.;38.4525483134914;-90.3318194444446
