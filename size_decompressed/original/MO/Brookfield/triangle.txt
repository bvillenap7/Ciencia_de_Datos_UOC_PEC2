It was 7:45 P.M. on Tuesday March 14, 2006 it was dark I was coming through town and I saw a triangle UFO. It was pink lighted with red dots on the corner. I stopped my car to observe it a little bit. It hovered in the sky above my car. It made no sound but I watched it some more. A car pulled up behind where I was parked to watch the object. I don't know who wathced the object with me whoever the man was that pulled up beside me and me and him observed the object he was a stranger. We still were watching this object. Then it disappeared me or him looked and didn't see it again. Then he cranked up his car and left. Then I got in my car and left and continued to drive through town. And I pulled up and ate at a roadside restaurant. It was clear outside. Me and the stranger couldn't believe what we were seeing.;39.7892;-93.075
