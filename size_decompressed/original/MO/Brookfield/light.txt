All had a red light and white strobe lights that appeared to rotate around them. While driving on Hwy 36 headed east my wife and I saw 3 objects moving in a northernly direction. The lead object seemed to be the largest.  They each had a solid red light and bright strobe like white lights that seemed to go around them.  The last one changed course and headed west while the first two stayed and waited.  Finally ( 5 min ) the last one turned back to the northern course and they all resumed they original heading.  We watched them for about 15-20 min.  I am 45, my wife is 38.;39.7892;-93.075
