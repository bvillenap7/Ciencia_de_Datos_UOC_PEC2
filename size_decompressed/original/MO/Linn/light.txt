Bright orb dancing in the east sky;2021-01-29 23:30:00;2 hours;Bright orb dancing in the east sky Me, My wife, and son watched an orb that looked like a star but was falling straight down then move left then move right then back up and would do this for 2 or 3 hours. We thought it was a star but the other stars were not doing this, they were all stationary. It was the size of the space station in the sky. We have looked since then and have not seen it return which makes me think it was not a star or it should be back the next night- never seen it again;38.4757;-91.8187
