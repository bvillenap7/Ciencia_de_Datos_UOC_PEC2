I noticed a capsule shaped silver colored object across the lake in the western sky approximately 500 yards away. It was stationary for a few minutes while we unloaded the boat. As we began our take off it began to move toward the north. As we headed up the lake it continued that direction until it was out of sight. Never heard a sound as from any engine nor did I observe any way for the craft to move.;37.1561;-90.7039
