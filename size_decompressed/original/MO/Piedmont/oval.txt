At approx. 22:00 hrs. on a Sun.nite late August of 1973 my girlfriend and I , while driving back to St.Louis from a campout at Clearwater Lake spotted litterally dozens of people standing outside there parked cars and staring into the sky.This was during the flap in S.E.Mo. that lasted more than 6 months . Don't know why theres not more about on this site it was a fantastic amount of sightings ,1000's ,daylight,underwater,ebes  sighted,.Anyway,we pulled over,walked to a lady and her husband asked what was going on ? LOOK!! We could see it thru the trees at a 45degree angle less than half a city block (1000 ft.) away,maybe 400 ft. off the ground . It glowed a beautiful yellow,gold giving off an aura the same color.It was an oval shape as we saw it from our position but I'm sure we were looking at it from a side angle.It bobbed in the air like a paper plate would on water and just hung in the sky.To this day Im sure it was showing off. After 45 minutes it simply started moving away at the same angle till it was completely out of sight . Not very fast,just as if it was giving us plenty of viewing time.As we stood there I did a rough head count , at least 50,maybe 60 witnesses .I've never heard any thing more of this specific sighting,would love to hear more on this site.;37.1561;-90.7039
