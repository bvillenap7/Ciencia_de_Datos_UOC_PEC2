Small bright orange object that appeared and disappeared at random.;1999-04-22 20:00:00;5 min.;Small bright orange object that appeared and disappeared at random. I told my mother, while we were driving down our gravel road at night,that I thought Venus was really bright. I looked away at something then went to try and find it again and study it.When i looked back I couldn't find any trace of it. I then saw two more appear over a field behind the trees and disappear again. Another appeared when we continued to look for them.It was very dark out and were a lot of stars. I found Venus and it wasn't nearly as bright as the lights. We also live very close to Clearwater Lake.;37.1561;-90.7039
Many bright orange glowing lights just over the horizon&behind the mountains,near the dam@Clearwater Lake in Missouri(CRAZY!!);2006-06-07 21:30:00;30 mins.;Many bright orange glowing lights just over the horizon&behind the mountains, near the dam@Clearwater Lake in Missouri(CRAZY!!) Seen a very bright glowing orange glowing light just over the mountains that came on like a spotlight,then fade out. Immediately 100ft from that spot the same orange light appeared ,then disappeared. Then around a mile to the left,one orange light appeared thenwas gone.2 more immediately appeared then were gone.About a min. later a little more than a mile back right 1 appeared then was gone,then within a few feet 1 more appears then another 1 and they were gone.  About 5 mins. later the craziest thing I ever seen, over the lake now all in the sky there were 10 different lights total that just kept appearing one after another fading in and out there were trails on a few of these. At this point I have chills running through my body.My friend was able to get a picture while I was running around freaking out. Then it all stopped. I don't understand what I saw,but I now feel there is something out there! What, I guess I'll never know.;37.1561;-90.7039
