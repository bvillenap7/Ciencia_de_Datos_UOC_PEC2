Red/orange fireball silently moving from west to east at Bluffview camp grounds, clearwater lake.;2014-07-12 21:45:00;3 minutes;red/orange fireball silently moving from west to east at Bluffview camp grounds, clearwater lake. We were camping at Bluffview, on Clearwater lake.  Around 9:45pm I was standing on site C18 with my friend facing north.   Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a orange glow to tne west of me.  The light was much larger than those on a plane, or helicopter.  It was completely silent, traveling from my 9 to about my 1 o'clock.   Just before it disappeared from view I was able to point it out to my wife who was heading back from the showers, and other campers on site c19 to the north of us.   I looked at it with my binoculars for about 20 seconds mid way thru the sighting, its center was bright yellow like a 60 watt light bulb with a orange/red blur surrounding it.   Almost before it disappeared from sight its flight became erratic and then it was gone.;37.1561;-90.7039
