Very erratic bright white light traveling south.;2019-11-24 17:40:00;15-20 seconds;Very erratic bright white light traveling south. One bright light that at first glance looked to be a star, then noticed it was moving fairly quickly. Movement became very erratic, perhaps twice the width of the light itself, several times per second. Viewed for 15-20 seconds, then went behind tree line. Was unable to locate again after entering vehicle to floow. Looked to be at great height to the east, as viewed from just west of Clearwater Lake, and traveling south.;37.1561;-90.7039
