Visiting the lake directly connected to my neighborhood with my brother and two childhood friends, we stood at the shore talking for a short time and completely sober.  A light appeared at some point (lake Pom De ter) like a sphere yet indescernable by light, over or in the thick clouds.  It would move to a point in front of the direction it was moving leaving a clone light similar to itself in its original postition and its origin would disappear in a repeating fashion over and over.  The light was a yellow and slightly orange color.   At the same location a few weeks prior I also noticed a colorful mostly purple explosion of color in the sky, however that I believe might have been a supernova.;37.8957;-93.3019
