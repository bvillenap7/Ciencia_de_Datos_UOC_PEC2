V formation of lights , glide across bottom of storm cloud.;2004-09-18 12:00:00;1-2 minutes;V formation of lights , glide across bottom of storm cloud. I saw a formation in the shape of a relaxed v or bird in flight.The v shape was a series of lights,that did not look like man made lighting.The lights were multi colored and irridesent.Above the lights it looked like the bottom of a craft which was metallic colored.The craft flew at the base of a storm cloud.The craft glided along gracefully.The craft would appear and disapear.The craft was moving slowly.The craft appeared to be moving in a fashion that reminded me of waves on the ocean.As soon as my brain understood what my eyes were seeing, I grabbed my camera which was right next to me.I stood up and began taking pictures and peeking above the lens to see it personally and to make sure it was still there.Then it was gone.This happened over the lake where we were camping.I  dont know if this has any thing to do w/ the siting, but my new mini van has had electrical problems since the siting.Afterwards the new battery was run down.Might I add it was Beautiful!;37.8957;-93.3019
