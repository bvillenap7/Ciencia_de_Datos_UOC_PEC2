I seen a light in the northern sky that was unusual in that I had never noticed it before.  I had a binocular and watched it for 15 minutes.  It had red, green yellow, and white lights. It stayed in mostly in the same spot only moving maybe 10 degrees to the east.  It also seemed to be spinning from the way the lights kept changing.  I would have thought many people would have seen it. It just floated in one spot for the whole time I wittnessed it.  Unfortunately I had to go to bed early that night so I didn't see what ever became of it.;38.574;-91.2291
