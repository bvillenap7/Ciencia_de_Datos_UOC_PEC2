Orange fireball thrusting across rural missouri inbetween cook station and Salem.;2009-12-01 18:40:00;15 secs;Orange fireball thrusting across rural missouri inbetween Cook Station and Salem. My family and I were traveling through cook station when I sighted a huge object with a blue and orange light.   As we traveled down YY hwy towards hwy 68, I caught sight of the object it quickly disappeared.    Oddly enough when I saw it I thought it was a huge helicopeter landing at the animal adventure ranch.  I made a note of the time which was 6:40 cst.   We traveled on and made it to FF hwy and went westerly.  It was in the western sky when i saw it again, but this time it was a huge fireball.  I kept losing sight of it as it was traveling and I was traveling around curves and trees were blocking me.   The last time I saw the object it was 7:03 I saw it a total of four different times.  Two times it looked to be on fire and thrusting towards salem.   When I saw them for the third time, it was like a big object in the sky on fire.   At one point the fire ball seemed to be half the size of the moon.  It was huge.   I lost sight of the object when we turned right on Hwy 72 towards Rolla, and the Fireball was presumed to go the other direction.   It appeared to be flying at the altitude of  low flying helicopters.  In fact this looked almost exactly like something I saw in 2002 that was reported here, except that object was lime green, and this fireball was orange.;37.618;-91.5184
