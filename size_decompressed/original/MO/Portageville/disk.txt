Disk over MO bootheel;2003-04-12 13:45:00;5 minutes;Disk over MO bootheel I had just finished eating lunch and was heading east out of Portageville, MO on Route 162 to see a co-worker.  I had just passed over the I-55 overpass when I noticed in front of me and at approximately 25 degrees above the horizon a very intense light, from an arc welder, with a very blinding deep blue color.  I pulled over on to the side of road and was almost hit by a car approaching me from the rear. The object zig-zagged in a z pattern and stopped, intense light stopped but was replaced by a less intense silver-gray giving way to the outline of a disk shaped object.  This state of dull gray lasted 3-4 minutes.  The Object just hovered but wobbled in placed until it became stationary.  About a minute later it began to move north and vanished.  Incident occurred on April 12, at approximately 1:45 pm. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and we found him to be quite eloquent, and credible.  He describes himself as holding a Ph.D. degree.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  We just noted an error with the date of the case, which we have corrected above.  Witness enters April 13 above, but states sighting occurred on April 12.  We have amended the date to April 12, which had to be the case, since the report was submitted April 12.
