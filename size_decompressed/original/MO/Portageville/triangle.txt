Multiple triangular objects with red and white lights spotted over southeast Missouri.;2013-11-13 20:00:00;hours;Multiple triangular objects with red and white lights spotted over southeast Missouri. Multiple triangular lights seen to the west, east, and overhead.  Some were closer (low flying plane high), some were further away (those overhead were very high, like low orbit high).  There were at least 3 white lights and multiple red lights on each object.  All objects were exactly the same.  The only things that differed were their location and altitude. Many people exiting a Wednesday night church service saw them as well as those working late at the local school district.  At least 34 people saw them. There were definitely more than 10 of these objects.  All objects except one seemed to just hover in the sky.  One object did move slightly towards an airplane that was in the sky.;36.4267;-89.6991
