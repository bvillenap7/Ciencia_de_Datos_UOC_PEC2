Red/Orange orb, moves in strange ways.;2014-02-27 00:00:00;20 minutes;Red/Orange orb, moves in strange ways I saw an orange-red orb floating high in the sky.  It zipped by at a fast speed, then slowly did a ‘figure eight.’  It would then stay put for a few seconds before slowly hovering, sometimes in a straight line, and other times in odd directions.  It was still there when I decided to go inside. This my fourth sighting of this same phenomena.  They date back to the summer of 2009. The sightings are always in the same spot in the sky (from my vantage point), and on at least one other occasion, there were several of these same orbs, floating together--the most I’ve ever seen were four orbs at a time.  During two of these sightings, the orbs disappeared and reappeared in unison. At a glance, this orb could easily pass for a very bright star, but if observed for more than five seconds, it is plain to see that it is definitely not a star.  It is the same color as the sun, dims and brightens in a pulsating fashion, and moves in odd ways.;37.0713;-89.5684
