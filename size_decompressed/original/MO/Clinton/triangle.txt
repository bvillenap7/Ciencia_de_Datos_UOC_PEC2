Set of triangular lights near Whiteman Air Force Base.;2007-03-07 00:45:00;3 minutes;Set of triangular lights near Whiteman Air Force Base. While driving from Clinton Missouri, to Kansas City on Highway 7.  My friend and I witnessed a very very bright set of lights in the Northwestern sky.  They were triangular in shape.  I asked my friend what it was and neither of us could figure it out.  We were leaned forward in the car watching the light which was stationary only a couple hundred feet off of the ground.  As we got close to the light it suddenly blinked out, the sky just went black. There was no sound what so ever, and no trail left of any kind.  Suddenly a low flying plane came out of the north headed to the area where the lights were.  It circled around the area and headed back towards Whiteman Air Force Base.   Neither my friend or I have ever seen anything like it.;38.402;-93.7836
