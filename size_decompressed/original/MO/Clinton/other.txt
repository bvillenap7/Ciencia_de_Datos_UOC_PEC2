Triangle shape with three shiny balls connected by transclucent looking lines;2006-07-29 13:00:00;5-7 minutes;Triangle shape with three shiny balls connected by transclucent looking lines I was inside the house and heard a loud humming sound from the outside and ran to look.  I ran to the deck and looked to the sky.  I saw three shiny balls conneced by a fine rigid line (it looked like fishing line, but did not bend)in the shape of a triangle.  The size and shape of this triangle remained constant, with the balls at each tip.  The sun was reflecting off the balls and also the lines.  The lines also seemed to glimmer in the sun, as if irridesant. This object appeared to be drifting slowly in a southern direction, coming across the tree tops into a clear sky.  It moved so slowly that it appeared to not have propulsion for movement.  I knew this object was moving because of the treeline, but I would not have recognized the movement without this point of reference.  The triangle was moving very slowly and still humming. This sound was very deep, vibrating in my stomach and ears.  There was a very slight breeze moving the tree tops back and forth.  I watched this object 5-7 mins. It continued going south and then  immediately disappeared.  The humming continued constantly throughout these 5-7 minutes and stopped suddenly when the object disappeared. I wallked out to the yard from my deck and searched the sky, but found nothing.  My house sets in the southwest side of Clinton, MO. My deck faces west, looking out on a field and then woods.  Behind the woods are Railroad tracks and then residential area.  Further southwest of my location is another new addition, then Truman Lake begins.;38.402;-93.7836
