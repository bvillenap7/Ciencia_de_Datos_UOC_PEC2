4 bright orbs hovering horiz. then 4 more appear vert.  Remaining for 2 min. disappeared, then 4 more appear.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-02 20:30:00;2-3 minutes;4 bright orbs hovering horizontally then 4 more appear vertically.  Remaining for 2 minutes disappeared, then 4 more appear. While driving South on Hwy 13 my wife and I noticed 4 orbs in a horizontal formation brightly glowing white to blue.  Thinking of all the things the lights could be and considering the fireworks season we didn't immediately jump to the conclusion of UFO, until 4 more lights appeared in vertical formation to the left of the first 4.  The horizontal lights then motioned left and right and the disappeared entirely and shortly after the vertical ones did the same.  We then turned off at an intersection and quickly found a parking spot to stop and hopefully observe more activity and sure enough 4 more lights appeared out of nowhere a little farther north, 3 in a vertical and 1 off to the right of the third light.  They grew very bright white and then vanished same as the ones before.  The lights were far to high to be a firework and had no characteristics of fireworks other than being lights in the sky.  They appeared from nothing having no sound and moved around as if! controlled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.402;-93.7836
