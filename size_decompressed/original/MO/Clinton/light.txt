PD));2004-01-19 19:00:00;1 hour;After an hour  the slow moveing distant light became to distant to see & stayed above the horizon. On Wednesday evening, 19 January 2005, at abouit 7 p.m. a close friend called us to report an odd observation.  We drove to her house and also observed this oddity.  This witness lives in the country, on W highway outside of Clinton, Mo..  She and two daughters had at that time watched this thing for approximately 15 minutes.  The original sighting had it slightly Northeast about 30 degrees above the horizon.  Original sighting had it the size oo a finishing nail-bright white, occasionally changing to red or green- some bright blue in the middle of the white area.  We arrived and watched it for approx. 40 min. during which time it reversed course, circled, stood still and then would continue SE growing smaller.  It never left the 30 degree above the horizon for the entire observation.This area very rural and noi lights  to obscure viewing ((NUFORC Note:  Given the long duration of the sighting, we wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at the star, Sirius.  Just a guess.  PD));38.402;-93.7836
