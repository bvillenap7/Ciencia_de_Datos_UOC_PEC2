elongated  grey diamond object that was aware of my obsrevation.;1999-08-15 13:30:00;less than two mins.;elongated  grey diamond object that was aware of my observation. his sighting happened several years ago,when I first actively started to watch the sky. I sent the information to a MUFON website and never heard or saw any thing pretaining to it  while standing under a  tree in my front yard, I heard a small private plane and having trained myself to  constantly look up, did so.  I saw an old single engine dropping something out its window.I thought - litterbugs in the sky!-and stepped out from under the tree to get a better view. The greyish bundle I saw while looking through the limbs was not falling, it had become an elongated diamond object that was behind and slightly below the tail of the plane and following it.   I looked and thought better remember exactly this thing.  It was the size of the wing of the plane, about 20 feet.  The shape was an elongated diamond with the top and bottom points clipped off, the front and back were very pointed. the color was graphite with darker and ligher shades mingled -think of a somone using a pencil with heavy and light pressure.  AS I am looking and thinking What is this thing?, it stops, it is aware of me!!! I can not handle this and so inside.   The time all this happened was probably no more than a minute or two. Oh! yes, when the ojected stopped it jiggled, while it was moving it quite smoooth. There was no sound from it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate. PD));38.7935999999999;-90.7853999999983
