Bright unmoving light i high in the clear sky.;2010-09-04 16:35:00;about 10 minutes;Bright unmoving light i high in the clear sky. Walking up the street. Weather conditions were clear skies, no clouds, no significant wind and temperature around75 degrees F. I saw a white spot of light in the sky, it appeared to be very high altitude, I thought it possibly could be Venus. The light was a yellow, white pin point of light. It was unmoving, I called my son who joined me in the street and helped him locate the object. He has had astronomy classes in college, but could not think of anything we would be able to see in that location at that time of day. The light was an estimated 50 -60 degrees from the horizon and roughly 105 degrees from north. These estimates were made after I got home and tried to recreate the positioning from memory. The light never moved and seemed steady, no flashing, blinking or twinkling like a star. no sounds were heard, but non were expected due to the appearance being so high. After about 10-15 minutes we both lost sight of the object and could not locate it again.;38.7935999999999;-90.7853999999983
