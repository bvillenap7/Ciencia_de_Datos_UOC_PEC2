Observed over 100 lights flying in a straight line at high altitude in Rural Washington Co..   ((Spacelink satellites??));2020-03-05 19:30:00;25;Observed over 100 lights flying in a straight line at high altitude in Rural Washington County, MO. I went outside in the backyard and looked up and saw numerous objects flying over the house at a high altitude in a straight line with equal-distant spacing.  They were traveling in an east, north-east direction.  At arms length, they were approximately 1 foot apart.  They were traveling six to ten times the speed of a commercial jet.  They were white and did not strobe like a commercial jet.  While observing them with binoculars, I saw bright lights cross their paths at extremely high speed like a meteor.  I did not observe any sound.  I called relatives two miles away and they were able to also view them.;38.057;-90.6295
