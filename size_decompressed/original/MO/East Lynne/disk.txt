disk shaped object glowing bright as daylight;1999-08-14 22:30:00;1.5 hours;disk shaped object glowing bright as daylight Saturday night August 14th 1999, I was watching the meteor shower when I noticed a glowing disk shaped object to the north. The object hovered and darted back and forth in an erratic manner.  I watch the sky almost nightly, I knew right away this was no star. After watching this light for more than half an hour it suddenly moved to the south (towards me) until it appeared to be about the size of a nickel at arms length and began to glow very brightly.  At the same time the entire area lit up like daylight, as if someone were taking flash photographs five or six times in succesion. The object itself was so bright I was still seeing red spots the next day.;38.6717;-94.2344
