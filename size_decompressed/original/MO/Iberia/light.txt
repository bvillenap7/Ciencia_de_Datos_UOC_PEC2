Very long line of white and red flashing red lights seen above Central Missouri.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-09 20:00:00;10 minutes;Very long line of white and red flashing red lights seen above Central Missouri. There was a very long line of flashing white and red lights that was seen across Central Missouri tonight by a number of people in several different towns.  It was seen North of St. Elizabeth, and they traveled SW and was seen in Iberia and the Lake Ozark area, a short time later.  Very very high in the sky.  Red and white flashing lights.  There was no sound at all.  They were not in any formation just a very long staggered line trailing one right after another.  You would think if it was some sort of jet there would be some sort of sound by how many there were.  It was completely silent.   They're are several videos that people are posting on social media of them.  I was able to get a video of them at the time.  Was very interesting to see.
