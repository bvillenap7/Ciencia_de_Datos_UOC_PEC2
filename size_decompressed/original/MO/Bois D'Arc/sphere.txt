Brilliant light seen from more than 60 miles away.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Jupiter, which is in the E sky now.  PD));2006-05-12 20:33:00;1 hour;Brilliant light seen from more than 60 miles away Was traveling eastbound from Joplin to Sprinfield around 8:30 or so.   From the time we left Joplin, we could see a brilliant object about 15 degrees above the horizon and to the north of I-44.    The object at first was throught to be Venus, but the color was wrong.  Not a typical yellow-green color as that of Venus, but a brilliant blue-white that appeared to change colors.   The object was visible from the time we left Joplin until before the Bois D'arc exit outside of Springfield.   Once we were close to Springfield, the object was gone.   We had thought that the object could have been a plane landing at Springfield, but landing lights are not that bright and cannot be seen from the distance we started at.
