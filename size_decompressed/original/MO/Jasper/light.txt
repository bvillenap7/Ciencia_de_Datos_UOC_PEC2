Made figure eight for a few minutes before suddenly disappearing. I was in my deer stand while hunting early in the morning, facing due west. As I looked up into the sky, I saw a massive yellow light, bigger and brighter than any star. The light began to move in a figure eight pattern for about 3 minutes before suddenly stopping. It sat completely still for about 30 seconds before completely disappearing, as if it was a light being turned off.;37.3333;-94.2957
