Ball of light in Concordia, MO- 1980;1980-09-01 17:00:00;3 seconds;Ball of light in Concordia, MO- 1980 In the fall of 1980, my roommate and I were walking on the campus of the boarding school we attended in Concordia, MO.  We were on the sidewalk on the perimeter of the quadrangle.  We saw a light, about the size and shape of a tennis ball,  emerge from behind a bush located on the quadrangle,  fewer than 10 feet away.  It quickly crossed the street separating us from the quad, crossed in front of us on the sidewalk,  and made a slight turn, and disappeared behind the campus chapel.  It happened so quickly, neither of us acknowledged it, not sure what it was we had just seen, or even if the other had seen it.  The next night I asked my roommate if she had seen what Iâ€™d seen, and she had.  Years later I wonder what it was, and look for reports of similar sightings.  It was not likely a space craft,  as it was so small, but it clearly moved with some kind of intelligence.  I would love to hear more stories of similar sightings.
