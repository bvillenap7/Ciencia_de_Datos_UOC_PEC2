Black triangle sighting.;2015-04-01 16:00:00;1 minute;Black triangle sighting. It was a partly cloudy, south of my destination.  I was driving my truck on I-70 W. near Concordia, Missouri.   During my trip at around 4:30 PM I turned and saw an object in the sky, flying west along the same route I was on.  The object was flying very low and was quiet.  I heard nothing related to an aircraft.   The object was black and in the shape of a triangle.  I saw no visible windows.  It was pitch black in color.   I never seen anything like it.  I thought it was flat and I was assured of this when the object shifted direction and started traveling southwest.  When it started turning it was flat and almost turned to its side in flight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness forwarded video of the sighting, but we are unable to see the object well, given that its image is very small in the frame of the camera.  PD));38.9797;-93.5796
