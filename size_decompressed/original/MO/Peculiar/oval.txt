Oval shaped object moving at extremely high rate with low light on opposite edges.;2009-09-19 05:45:00;5 seconds;Oval shaped object moving at extremely high rate with low light on opposite edges. At approximately 5:45 A.M. I stepped out onto my front porch to have a cigarette.  It is very dark where I live because we are outside of the major KC area so I was enjoying a wonderful view of Orion's Belt.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement and focused in on it.  An object was moving at an extrememly fast rate from the west.  It was an oval shaped object which at first I thought just had some white coloring on the outside edges opposite each other but then realised I was seeing lights when the shape moved over some slight cloud cover to the west of my house.  I could see the faint glow of the edges through the clouds.  There was no sound whatsoever.  And it was moving so fast that the entire thing lasted about 5 seconds before it moved out of view.;38.7154;-94.439
