My deck has a roof so I leaned on the rail to look up at the sky. While looking at the positions of the stars my gaze was drawn like a magnet to a perfect V formation that was traveling across the sky from South to North. After staring at stagnant field of stars the speed of this formation of lights was hyper speed. Hard to study this craft when it went from horizon to horizon in 4 seconds. Seemed like 4 separate lights that moved like a solid shapeâ€¦very hard to tell at that speed.;38.7154;-94.439
