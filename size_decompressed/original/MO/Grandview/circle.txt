It  seemed like minutes passed, but only seconds.;1989-09-17 05:37:00;4-5 sec;It  seemed like minutes passed, but only seconds. my husband and i were on our to work. We were at stoplights one block from our apartments. I looked up above lights and this bight round white/bluish/green object was right in front of us seemed still for a few seconds. Like it was coming right at us, then it was gone, I couldn't tell which way it went. It was like it vanished in thin air.  My husband looked at me crazy and asked what the hell was that? I rplied, I don't know. You tell me. Wait til i tell, Mom. He said, No! People will think we're crazy!  We looked around still sitting at the intersection, to if there were any other cars around that might of wittnessed this too.  There wasn't.  I tried to speak to him about it later at lunch break.  He wouldn't. He was still pretty freaked out about it.  But me, I was curious to know about it.  Still to this day, I still seek in the skies at night. I have wittnessed other sightings in Grandview, MO. years later.  Not alone, either.;38.8793999999999;-94.5174000000004
