WHILE DRIVING EAST ON HWY 150 ON WEDNESDAY ,MARCH 16 @ APPROX. 4:45PM , I SAW DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF MY CAR A OBJECT FLYING APPOROX. 20 -30 FT ABOVE THE GROUND TRAVELING SLOWLEY HEADING SOUTH,(DIRECTLY TOWARDS RICHARDS -GEBAUR , NOW A MILLITARY TRAINING FACILITY.) THIS CRAFT WAS COMPLETELY BLACK WITH NO EXTERNAL MARKINGS , IT HAD TWO SHORT WINGS ,OR AT LEAST WHAT APPAERED TO BE WINGS AT THE APPROX. MID POINT OF THE CRAFT AND ALSO TWO SMALL ANTENNEA , OR ONCE AGAIN WHAT APPEARED TO BE ANTENNEA STICKING OUT FROM BOTH ENDS. THE ENTIRE CRAFT WAS APPROX. 4-6FEET LONG, I REALIZE THAT THIS MAY POSSIBLY BE A MILLITARY SURVAILANCE DRONE. IF IT IS , IT HAS THE ABILLITY TO STAY AIRBORN AT SPEEDS WELL BELOW STALL SPEED , ALSO IT HAD NO APPARENT MEANS OF PROPULSION i.e. NO PROPELLER ,NO VISABLE ROCKET OR JET ENGINES , AND THE WAY IT FLEW WAS AMAZING , SLOW, CONTROLLED, I CAN ONLY DECRIBE IT AS FORWARD HOVER. WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE SUNNY WARM & CLEAR;38.8793999999999;-94.5174000000004
