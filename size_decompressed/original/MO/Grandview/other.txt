I witnessed a low, slow flying airfcrfaft that was out of the ordinary. It was shaped like a flat V. It was black with glowing lights. The lights were not very bright. More glowing than shining. It mostly resembled the Phoenix Lights incident. I live an hour away from Whitemans Air Forfce base in Missouri. Although it made no sound at all, I have seen the B-2 Stealth bomber many times and I would have not been mistaken. There is a nuclear facility in South Kansas City being made. Reports have indicated that unidentified flying objects have been attracted to nuclear sites.;38.8793999999999;-94.5174000000004
