V-shaped UFO with 5 glowing lights underneath was seen flying low and slow, without much sound.;2010-10-13 18:15:00;5-10 seconds;V-shaped UFO with 5 glowing lights underneath was seen flying low and slow, without much sound. About 20 minutes before sundown while on the phone I noticed an aircraft which was thin, black and shaped like a V. It had 5 glowing orange lights underneath. ( lights 2 ft. diameter) As it passed overhead (NW to SE), I didn't hear much except for a quiet humming sound. It was flying low (app. 200 ft.) and slow (app. 100 mph). The wingspan was around 40 to 50 ft. It wasn't a B2-stealth bomber, Ive seen many (whitemans AFB). There was no cockpit, fuselage, rutters, or engines. Just a V. Seemed to be floating, or hovering. My best guess is that it is an undercover drone or surveillance plane. Maybe for reading temperatures.  I need help identifying this aircraft. I never thought Id see a UFO until i saw this. My report is documented with MUFON case #25885.  The only discrepancy in my account, is the wingspan of the aircraft.  I said 200 feet, but it was more around 40 to 50 feet.;38.8793999999999;-94.5174000000004
