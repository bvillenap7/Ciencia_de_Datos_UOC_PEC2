Multiple white orbs crossing the road at fencerow height in broad daylight.;2010-11-06 16:30:00;15-20 seconds;Multiple white orbs crossing the road at fencerow height in broad daylight. On the afternoon of 11/06/10 at approximately 4:30 PM, I was driving on a gravel road outside of Marceline, MO near the Old Reservoir. As I made the crest of a hill, I suddenly saw white lights that looked like the size of a light bulb cross the road going from west to east at what looked to be no higher than 5-10 feet off of the ground.  Now, they were probably about ½ mile away, so they may have been more the size of a basketball. They were going in a perfect straight line, one right after the other. I thought I was seeing a reflection of something, so I removed my glasses, and I could still see them. They just kept coming one right after the other, and I kept anticipating for this to stop, but it never did for what seemed like a long amount of time, but was realistically only 10-15 seconds. They moved very swiftly and in a perfect rhythmic pattern or tempo. Like I said,  one right after the other. They went into the trees or what you might call a forest area off to the east, and I didn’t see them anymore.  It happened so fast and they just came out of nowhere, so unexpectedly, that I have no idea as to what these were. I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I hope I never do. I drove on down to where they crossed and there were some horses in a field not far away,  that were all huddled together, like they were spooked.  This was in the broad daylight with the sun out, a real nice day. I can’t explain it, and I even called the Sheriffs department later that evening to ask if anyone had reported seeing anything strange around the old reservoir, but no one had.  I didn’t give my name, as I thought they may think I was crazy!  I can’t get this out of my head, and I replay it every day in my mind. If you can tell me what I saw, that would be great..;39.7135;-92.9363
