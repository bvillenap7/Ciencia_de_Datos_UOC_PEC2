Triangle looking satelite maybe.Moved at speed of light or close to it. Was at my grandparents.  The land that my granparents live on is an acreage close to an amish comunity with no crops or anything,just trees and grass.  There is a railroad that runs very close to the house and acreage.  When me my cousin and uncle arrived at the house aroud 10:00 or 10:30 pm we exited the car.  I was in the backseat on the drivers side.  My cousin was on the passenger side and ran into the house in a hurry to use the bathroom.  As i was shutting my door to the car an object dropped verticaly down above me and my uncle.  It had to of been moving at the speed of light and stopped on a dime.  The object spun around,paused for a second then shot back off into the sky as fast as it came. The object looked like it could have been a salelite or similar but not as bulky as ours.It was triangle shape with three red lights. The red lights were attached by what looked to be poles or bars. These bars joined together at looked to be a circular object in the upper mi! ddle that was maneuvering the satelite looking object.  I have only told but a few people because of all the false and fake reports in the world.   Im reporting now because im getting older and its been bothering me.  Someone may have seen this also.  This is not a made up story or imaginary.  My uncle also seen it. He has since passed away. I hope someone else has seen this.  I put Eldon as the town but we were in the country not in town that was the closest town to us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.3378;-92.5696
