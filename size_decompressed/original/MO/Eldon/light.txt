bright red light zig zag across sky then disappear;2004-08-15 23:35:00;5-10 sec.;bright red light zig zag across sky then disappear I was driving home from work that evening and I was on HWY M, getting ready to turn on to my gravel road to get to my house, and suddenly I saw just above the tree line a red light. At first I thought it might be a red light on a tower, but I don't think there are any towers with red lights in the area, and I only saw one light. As I watched it, it zig zagged across the sky extremely fast and it didn't look like a pattern that a normal plane or jet could fly. This startled me and before I could stop my car to get a better look at it, it zig zagged and then suddenly disappeared. I looked every night after that but did not see it again.
