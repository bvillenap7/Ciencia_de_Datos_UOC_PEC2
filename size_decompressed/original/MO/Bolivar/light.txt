MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  Starlike object moves very slowly west of Hwy 13 in Boliver then hovers.;2004-06-26 03:00:00;1 minute;Starlike object moves very slowly west of Hwy 13 in Boliver then hovers then shoots up skyward unlike any airplane [Forwarded report by Brian Adams of the Missouri Investigators Group (UFOMIG.com) received 6/30/04.]  I am a security guard for a business in south-west Missouri.  I am also a former police officer.  I have over 25 years in either the police or security industry.  And, I am not prone to seeing things.  I was working late and walking through the parking lot at approximately 3:00am.  The sky was crytal clear and the wind was calm.  I first saw the object out of the corner of my eye.  At first, I thought it was a star.  But, I noticed it was moving very slowly.  Thinking it was an airplane, I watched it.  But, it was moving too slowly for an airplane.  And, it did not have any of the warning lights common to an airplane.  The object moved very slowly from north to south.  It was moving in a straight and level manner.  It did not twist and turn at all.  As I watched, the object slowed down to almost a stop.  At that point, I was convinced it was not an airplane.  The object was just west of the town of Bolivar.  It was moving parallel to 13 highway.  It had the appearance of a small airplane flying approximately 2000 feet above the ground.  I was standing on the east side of 13 highway and it was on the west side.  It appeared to be less than one mile away and approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon.  There was some shimmering.  But, not much.  After about 10 or 15 seconds, the object sped up to its original speed.  It continued to travel south for about another 20 seconds.  The object then shot stright up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed.  It moved so fast, I could not track it.  I did not see it again. I watched for it over the following two evenings, but did not see it again.  I have worked at this business for the past several months, and this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this in the area. Even though I saw something similar many years ago in Colorado, I am not really sold on the existence of UFO's.  But, I would really like to know what that was.

Bright reddish and yellow lights west of Bolivar.;2012-12-23 06:10:00;8 minutes;Bright reddish and yellow lights west of Bolivar. I was outside smoking a cigarette and I looked to the western sky.  I saw a bright reddish light, much brighter than the stars.  I watched it closely and it appeared to have a white or yellowish light circling it.  At times the reddish light was not visible and only the other light was.  It was moving up and down in a small area and at times would move up diagonally very fast before moving back down to the original position slowly.  It then flashed blue once and started to slowly move north.  As it was moving north it went back to the original light pattern, and was getting harder to see. It eventually moved behind a tree line and I lost visual contact.;37.6112;-93.4140000000001
