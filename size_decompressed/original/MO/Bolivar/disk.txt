I was going hwy 13 5 miles south of bolivar and noticed 8 saucers that blinked on and off after I heard some one call in from the Art Bell progam coast to coast, I was heading up that way anyway and I came upon them heading East in a V formation with strobbing lights and beams coming down from them going over the rural area as if they were looking for something, within 3 miles from me and a clear night so I could see the shape very well I looked to my right and about a distance of 3 blocks I saw a craft rising out of the bottom of the gully and light surrounded all around it glowing yellowish golden color. They had extreme fast speed and stopped on a dime and rose up and down the terrian. If anyone wants to contact me write to mlrmtn7@yahoo.com;37.6112;-93.4140000000001
Multiple lights and Disc shaped craft spotted south of Bolivar.;2012-06-24 03:15:00;15 minutes;Multiple lights and Disc shaped craft spotted south of Bolivar. I was sitting outside at 3:15 am on a smoke break.  I was looking at the western sky like I usually do and noticed a light which at first glance I thought was a twinkling star.  Then I noticed it was too bright to be a star and appeared to be moving in a small figure eight motion.  I also saw a few flashes that appeared to be orange smoke.  This really surprised me because I was under the impression that this was very far away.  I then noticed a smaller light that appeared to come from the first.  This light was moving east and flashing infrequently.  It would flash a few times then was out of site until it flashed again at a significant distance from the last flashes.  As this light got about halfway across my field of vision 5 to 6 more of these small flashing lights appeared and moved out of my field of vision in every direction.   After these lights were gone a larger &quotcraft&quot which I originally thought was a plane came into view.  It had a flash! ing light like any plane does but I noticed the whole side of the craft was lit.  I could clearly see the shape to be what I can only describe as a disc or saucer viewed from the side.  I watched this craft moving west towards the original light and it slowly dimmed out after it passed the original light.  The original light was still in the sky when I went back inside.;37.6112;-93.4140000000001
