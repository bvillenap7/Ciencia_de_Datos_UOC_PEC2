Green Fireball.;2004-01-15 23:00:00;1 minute;Green Fireball. We were driving home from Bolivar heading north on 64 hwy.  I just happened to look out of my drivers side window and saw a huge green fireball, maybe 500 feet off of the ground moving too slow to be a meteor.  It took it about a minute to go below the treeline and out of sight.  I've watched meteor showers many times and this was no meteor. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
