June 01, 2010 V-shaped cluster;2010-06-01 23:00:00;8 seconds;June 01, 2010 V-shaped cluster Someone just sent me a link to this site and upon reading several of these events, i noticed two June 01,  2010 sightings.  this is the exact night and same formation of lights i saw! I was with a couple friends walking on the golf course real late, and i happened to look up and saw 8-10 lights moving NW. it was weird though, they were moving REALLY fast and it was totally quiet. Just thought i'd share. Thanks;37.6112;-93.4140000000001
