I had seen this several times before but did'ent take the time to look closely.This time I got my binoculars . This bright light stood still most of the time but at times it bounced to the left or right and up or down.When looking at it through the binoculars it was triangle shaped and was blinking 3 colors red,blue and white or yellow. What was realy strange was it looked like you were looking through heat waves. It shimmered and seemed to be spinning.It was very hard to watch.It was also over a place where there is only woods and a lake,also a place called mingo swamp wildlife refuge.I watched for apx. 30 mnt.got spooked and went in.;36.942;-90.1601
