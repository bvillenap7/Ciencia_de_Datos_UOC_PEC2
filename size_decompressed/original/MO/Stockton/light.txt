It just sat there, pulsing, getting quick glances of red or orange.  I took 2 photos but then started taking video.  I kept very still and had my hands propped in order to stay still.  You can see the object slowly moving eventually.  Finally after about 20 minutes it was gone.  It is a very clear night.  My husband and I can clearly see constellations.  It had to be a number of miles away.;37.7255;-93.7921
