Points of white light parallel to the horizon converging then diverging in fan a formation.  ((anonymous report));2013-12-30 02:30:00;1 minute;Points of white light parallel to the horizon converging then diverging in fan a formation. Points of white light in the western sky.  Evenly spaced, near to and parallel to the horizon. Seemed to be hovering/traveling slowly away from me.  Hovering lasted about a minute. Points of light converged in a space of 2 seconds, rose slightly as one, and flew apart at great speed in a fan formation. Viewed through a window.  Not at all sure of the date, but it must've been winter for me to be able to see the horizon clearly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
