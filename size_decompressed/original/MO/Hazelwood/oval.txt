Disappeared half-way across. saw something unusual Friday night (7/4) with my boys (7 and 6).  Didn't think much about it at the time.  It got us talking about shooting stars and stuff.  Heard it on the radio today (KMOX) and thought I would pass this along. I'll start by saying I am not a UFO fanatic, I don't believe in aliens or beings from other planets.  But I certainly saw something unusual the other night. It was between 9:15-9:45, we were waiting for fireworks (the show started at 9:45). My 6 year old noticed it first, and caught my attention. It was green, bullet shaped (like half a capsule.  A rounded edge, flat back.  No stream or tail). Streaked across the sky, and vanished about half way across.  It moved quite quickly, maybe I saw it for 2-3 seconds before it was gone. At first I thought it was some unusualy fireworks (but thinking it is very large).  Then it disappeared as a firework would, but with no explosion or fanfare.  Just gone. It was quite large, perhaps as large in sight as a full moon. If I have my bearings correct, it streaked from North to South. I was at White Birch Park in Hazelwood, MO (St Louis county), facing McDonnell Blvd, it streaked from my left to right.;38.7794;-90.3679000000001
