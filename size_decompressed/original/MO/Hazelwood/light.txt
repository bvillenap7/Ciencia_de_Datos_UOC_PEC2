Good visibility, cloud layer high up.   Suddenly a bright intensely red ball shaped object descended slowly above us and to our front.  Seemed close and all exclaimed: What is that?  No noise.  It just continued the descent across a small valley of houses and curved away to the north above the rim of the river valley away from us and seemed to disappear behind trees.  It appeared about the size of a basketball from where we stood and appeared controlled in movement and not subject to wind.   Did not see it arrive.  The light appeared above us and had no characteristic of any firework we had seen.;38.7794;-90.3679000000001
