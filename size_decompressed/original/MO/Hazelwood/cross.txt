Triangular T-shaped object observed in St. Louis County.;2013-05-25 19:55:00;10-12 minutes;Triangular T-shaped object observed in St. Louis County. Without the aid of binoculars it appeared as an orb of light that changed colors.  It flew in view from left to right, up and down, rotated or spun at random, as well as sat in one place.  When observing it with binoculars it was a triangular shape made up of three light bars.  It appeared to have a T shape to it. The center section was white, and the sides where red and green.  There was nothing that could be seen that connected the light bars together.  When observed with the naked eye it appeared to be an orb and had a glow or haze that changed color, once seen through binoculars it had a distinct shape made of the three bars of light without glow/haze.   The bars of light did not change color.  It was observed by my girlfriend and I for about ten to twelve minutes.  I have 4 videos taken via cell phone.;38.7794;-90.3679000000001
