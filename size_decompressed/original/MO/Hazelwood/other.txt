Stealth crescent banking maneuver .;2012-05-23 02:20:00;30-45seconds;stealth crescent banking maneuver . I apologize for my poor formatting. I can’t recall the exact day, but I know it was the  2nd or 3rd week in May, around 2:30 am CDT. Looking west at a dark night sky, observing the stars .when I notice that something blotted out the area I was looking at. I noticed something moving in the night sky a crescent shaped object moving north, no lights, or sound. I did notice the dim lighting of the lights from the location below reflecting, illuminating the object.  The area is suburban, to give you an idea of the lighting I’m speaking of. My observation was 30 to 45 seconds, and then the object Turned West seemed to maneuver into a horizontal flight position, so I assume what the crescent object was doing was the banking maneuver. At this time I lost visual contact. I was not thinking of what to use as a guide to accurately measure the size of the object. I do live close to an airport, where daily military F15s have runs.  I can say that what I saw was flying lower than the usual fly by of the jets I see during the day and what I saw was definitely bigger by 10 to 15 feet. Did I see a drone? The location of the airport is in St. Louis, MO. Lambert International airport /Boeing.  Thank you for your time ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
