I witnessed a very bright, orange, and white fireball going East to West in the Southern sky from Hazelwood, Missouri.  The object traveled horizontally across the Southern sky.  It did not appear to me to be a shooting star, or like any picture I have seen of a “flying saucer”.  The sky was black, and the visibility was excellent.;38.7794;-90.3679000000001
