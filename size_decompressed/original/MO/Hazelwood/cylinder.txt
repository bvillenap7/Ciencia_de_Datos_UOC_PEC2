I was sitting on my backporch with my daughter when I was pointing to an airliner flying over.  My eyes caught unto a cylnder object hanging in the air like a piece of string.  The object was a long cylinder shape, mettallic, and the sun was reflecting off of it which is how it caught my eye.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but when I focused on it closely it was nothing resembling any airplane I ever saw. I watched the object as it slowly rotated to its side and started to move across the sky. Thats when I noticed the airforce jets coming in.  I called my wife and tried to show her the object but she couldnt find the right postition in the sky.  As I was watching the object and showing her the object bent into a boomerang shape and whent in a new direction. The object picked up speed and seemed to compress and was gone. I dont know if it accelerated or just vanished.  About 3 minutes after that my wife and I was discussing it when in that exact same spot smoke started to form and shape into a ring. the ring moved across the sky for a good ways before dissolving. My wife saw that.  From the distance in the sky where the jets and the objects were the smoke ring had to be huge. As I look back on it I would say those jets were chasing the object or at least trying to get to it. And I cant say for sure but for some reason I think if the sun had not been reflecting off of the object it would have been invisible. I say that because it did not look the way it should look when sun is reflecting off of metal it was almost to bright, like if I had a pair of binoculars and could see the cylinder in detail I would have saw myself perfectly in the reflection.;38.7794;-90.3679000000001
