Appeared small, but it was hard to tell. I was returning from a tour of one of the buildings I patroll as a security guard. I was walking across the parking lot, west to east. Something in the sky caught the light from the city below. It was more or less triangular, with a very slight taper to a point in the rear. There were no lights on the object, and it made no sound. It was apparently traveling east to west and was in the process of making a u-turn to go west to east. I watched it as far as I could see it as it was only a darker patch in a dark sky. I lost sight of it somewhere over Lambert International Airport, wich lies east of the place where I work.;38.7794;-90.3679000000001
