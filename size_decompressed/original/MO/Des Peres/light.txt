Me and my friend noticed that there was a strange blue glow that illuminated us to the point where we could see our shadow.  I was thinking that it must be a huge firework, being that it was the 4th of july.  when i turned around every hair on my body stood on end as a blue ball of what appered to be energy hovered over my house behind a tree. it then moved slowly and noislessly out from behind the tree.  it then appeared to absorb itself instintaniously. It did not shot off at high speeds or anything it just disappered. there are many sightings of the same object in my area at the same time but nobody seems to have seen the object at this close of a distance. did anyone realize that this is also the 50th aneversary of the supposed roswell crash?
