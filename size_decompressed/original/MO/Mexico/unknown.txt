Black object seen flying very high/fast changing direction/altitude at incredible rate until it disapeared into the clouds.;1999-09-01 19:40:00;45 sec;Black object seen flying very high/fast changing direction/altitude at incredible rate until it disapeared into the clouds. The black object was too high to distinguish shape. It was seen in the southern sky flying west to east faster than commercial aircraft are normally observed in this same area. The object flew perfectly straight and then suddenly and with incredible speed made a wide right turn to the southeast and increased altitude until it disappeared into the very high clouds. A commerial aircraft flew over from east to west a minute or so later and was much slower and lower than the object.(it is very common to see commercial aircraft in this area flying in both directions-we are located between St Louis and KC airports-aircraft are near cruising altitude/speed as they fly over us). I am a police officer with 15 years experience and often look at the sky and the aircraft that fly over as I relax in the evening. I could not say for sure what I saw but I know it was not an aircraft/bird/etc.;39.1692000000002;-91.8893000000008
