Slowed in speed, leveled off and dissapeared over the horizon. At about 6:00 pm on November 16,1999, my husband and I observed an object in the sky. We were traveling east toward Mexico MO and were nearing Rt E on our way to pick up our child from day care when I noticed a bright green object in the sky north of our location.It had a copper-colored tail trailing behind. I asked my husband what it was and he looked and observed the same thing. It was traveling NW to SE at a very rapid pace,and I thought it was going to impact the ground. It then slowed in speed and leveled off having lost it's tail in the process. It then sped off to the SE and over the horizon. The sky was clear that night, and the humidity level was relatively low. The temperature was mid to lower 50s. My husband is 41 and I am 39. My husband has an Associates degree and works as a machinest for a local university. I have had some college and work as a customer service manager for a restaurant supply company. We are from New Mexico and have lived in Missouri for the last 13 years. We have two children and travel the above route twice a day to work and back.;39.1692000000002;-91.8893000000008
