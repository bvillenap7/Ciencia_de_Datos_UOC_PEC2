The light moved into view with no sound in the eastern sky, stopped and became really bright , dimmened then left.;2009-06-28 22:15:00;15 sec;The light moved into view with no sound in the eastern sky, stopped and became really bright , dimmened then left. Around 10:15 pm we were enjoying our deck fire pit and our son had just got home from work.  We were enjoying the night sky, seeing a plane cross the sky now & then. My wife just made the comment, there's another jet, moving north to south in the eastern sky, when it stopped and just like a dimmer switch, became really bright...it then dimmened and started moving south again behind the tree line with a much smaller light moving behind it.....all this lasted maybe 20 seconds and that was it....  Clear sky, no breeze, above tree line east of our house...shape was a round moving light that stopped & became really bright, then dimmened and moved on...Thank You !;39.1692000000002;-91.8893000000008
