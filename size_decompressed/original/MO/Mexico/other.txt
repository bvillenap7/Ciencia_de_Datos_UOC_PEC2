Multiple UFO sightings in a single area on the outskirts of small town.;2012-05-25 21:40:00;roughly 1 hour;Multiple UFO sightings in a single area on the outskirts of small town. I live in Mexico, MO zip 65265.  The date is 5/25/12 and the time is 10:45 pm.  I was just lying on my car and watched what I believed at first to be a star start and continue to move in erratic patterns.  (north/ west/ east concentric circles etc) It is a overcast night, so I was really just trying to pick out stars through the clouds when I caught sight of it.  I spotted the object at around 9:40 or so, and watched the object for roughly 30 to 40 minutes.  Then I saw two dim glowing lights, which appeared to be on the underside of a belly of a broad shaped rounded triangular craft, (almost as if they were on the wing ends) in a trailing motion shoot across the sky to the north west and disappear. I walked across the street to my neighbors house as my neighbor was sitting outside on his front steps facing towards the north and his wife just pulled up in her vehicle.  I asked them if they saw the lights, and neither one of them had been watching the sky at all. I went in to tell my wife as I was very excited to have witnessed what I did and she came out and we both proceeded to watch the sky for roughly 10 min before we saw what appeared to be a white shooting star from the south east pause, move very erratically, (almost as if a sparkler held by a child no trail though) then shoot off in an eastern slightly northern trajectory very quickly.  Then as my wife who was frightened by the sighting stayed by my side there I saw an additional light (red this time) moving towards the south pause and change directions much the way the first object did for just a couple of moments.  I then lost sight roughly at 10:25 or so.  It was very dim and my wife who wears corrective lenses could not make out the last sighting.;39.1692000000002;-91.8893000000008
