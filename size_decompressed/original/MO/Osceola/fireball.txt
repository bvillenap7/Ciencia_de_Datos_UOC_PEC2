The night we saw the object the sky was clear and we were in the river on a boat. It was very dark. Suddenly there was a Huge flash of light that lite the whole sky. The flash was similar to that of a flash from a camera on a much larger scale. It lit up the river enough to see the people fishing on the shore.  This caused the three of us to look skyward and saw what looked similar to a falling star. It was very obvious that it wasnt a star due to the Huge size of it. It started to leave a trail of several colors. Blue, red yellow and white. I was facing East and my other two friends were facing west. The object traveled from what seemed to be  South East to North West. I have enjoyed sky gazing since I was a youngster and have seen hundreds of Shooting stars in my life This wasnt one.  Looking in the sky in a panoramic view I would say that it traveled accross the whole length of my view of the sky. The object then vanished. As if it had burnt up like a shooting star. It was not more than five minutes later when the three of us heard what sounded like a Boom. Perhaps a sonic boom. It was a very Deep bang. Similar to a blast of dynamite.  Well that's it. I was told later that it might have been space junk perhaps.  If thats the case I suppose the Titanic fell out of orbit. Thank You for taking the time to read my story. This was truly a story that I will never forget. The most spectacular light show Ive ever seen. Fourth of july early.;38.0257;-93.756
