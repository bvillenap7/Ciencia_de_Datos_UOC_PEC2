The craft was close enough we could see it perfectly, it was a triangle craft, low flying and completely silent.;2016-02-28 22:35:00;10 minutes;The craft was close enough we could see it perfectly, it was a triangle craft, low flying and completely silent. I noticed a light in the distance that seemed like a very bright strobe light, as we got closer to home, it seemed to follow us, but staying ahead, although when we pulled into our driveway it changed directions and passed directly over us.    The pattern of the lights blinking gave us both the impression it was rotating slowly but it could have just been the light pattern on the perimeter of the craft.   As it passed over us it seemed to be completely silent, although it was even lower than a helicopter would have flown.   Its underside also had lights that appeared to be all white at the corners and middle.  I would estimate it was a little bigger than a commercial aircraft and seemed to be flying about as fast as we were driving, around 60 miles per hour.;37.328;-92.9276
