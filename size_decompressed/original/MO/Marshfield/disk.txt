Ufo on 18 wheeler.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably the U. S. Navy UAC, the X-47B, being transported to the Washington, D.C., area.  PD));2012-06-07 22:53:00;1 minute;ufo on 18 wheeler i was driving to work and i saw a line of government vehicles driving down the interstate with their lights on then there was 2 18 wheelers, one had a regular trailer on it and the other had a flatbed on it with a giant disk shaped object that took up both sides of the road plus a little then there was another row of government vehicles. i approached this around mile marker 97. it was something i have have never seen and it honestly scared me a bit. it kind of makes me think the government is trapping them for technology at least that is my assumption. i just want an explanation on what it was and if it was extraterrestrial.
