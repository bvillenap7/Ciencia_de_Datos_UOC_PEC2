Red pulsating light;1999-01-20 17:30:00;40 minutes;Red pulsating light I was driving from Lebanon to Springfield on Interstate 44 when I saw a red pulsating light to the south that resembled a warning light on a communications tower.  At first I thought it was a tower light or perhaps an airplane, but there were no lights where other tower lights would be.  The light did not move in the sky, but stayed in its position as would a star.  However, no other stars were visible as the sky was cloud-covered.  The ball of pulsating red light (about the size of a BB at arms length)just stayed with me for 40 to 45 minutes until, near Springfield, it seemed to have moved further south and become smaller.;37.328;-92.9276
Bright lights, jets, mystery.;2006-10-28 18:15:00;25 minutes;Bright lights, jets, mystery. My son was walking our dog and called me on his cell phone and said he was watching some very strange lights in the sky and I should come see this for myself.  I grabbed my keys and my daughter and I got in the car and drove to the area where he said he was. This took about 1 to 2 minutes.  We all saw a bright circle in the sky east of Marshfield.  It was traveling slowly straight up and then down.  It moved in circles and even in a z shape.  Periodically it would split into 2 lights and then reform into 1. We watched this for about 13 minutes and then what appeared to be 2 jets very quickly flew from the north straight for the light.  1 jet almost appeared to collide with it and the 2nd jet flew past.  That's when we noticed the second light about a 1/2 mile further south. this light then turned red and then white over and over and then went straight up into the clouds.  At this point we noticed the other light was gone also.  The jets flew north.  We returned home.  The entire time I was telling my husband about it over the cell phone.  He was out of town at the time.  We love stories about ufo's but have never personally seen anything. This was awsome!;37.328;-92.9276
Apx 22:00 went out and looked up and saw a line of lights moving in a straight line. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 22:00:00;Apx. 10 minutes;Apx 22:00 went out and looked up and saw a line of lights moving in a straight line. There was 2 and 3 and single lights moving at the same speed and moving from west to east and there was no sound so I know it wasn't any Jets, so I ran inside and woke my husband to show him and he saw the end of the line of them and they got to one spot and disappeared one at a time.;37.328;-92.9276
