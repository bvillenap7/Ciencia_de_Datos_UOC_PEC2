Extremely bright white and red flashing lights outside, lighting up our bedroom.;2016-08-20 23:00:00;10 seconds;Extremely bright white and red flashing lights outside, lighting up our bedroom. My wife and I were laying in bed and saw what appeared to be heat lightening flashing faintly outside our window.  However, it quickly began flashing brighter and faster.  Within about 5 seconds it appeared to be a very bright, white strobe light outside our window. Suddenly, our room lit up red.  I jumped up and looked outside and it completely stopped. No noises were heard from our side during this time, and it definitely did not appear to be lightening or any type vehicle.  My wife stated she has seen it for several nights now, but this was my first. Also, I don't know if this is related or not, but my neighbor is claiming that something very large has been attacking his dog.  His dog is fenced in his back yard and weighs approximately 75lbs.;38.5281;-93.5364
