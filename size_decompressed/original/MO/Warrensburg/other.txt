I was at a local park with 2 friends between midnight of the 24th and 1:00 a.m. of the 25th.  All three of us were swinging and listening to our own portable music.  At approximately 1 a.m., I saw an object in the sky that I was and am unable to identify.  What I could see of the object consisted of 5 disks of light which were the color and brightness of the stars in the sky, but much larger than stars, and these lights were arranged in a distinct V shape. The quality of the light is much different from any light I know of on an airplane.  Whereas airplane lights consist of small, bright lights, the lights I saw were large, dim, and disk-shaped.  The angle of the disks demonstrated that the lights were on the bottom of something and that they were not very far away (horizontally). The object moved at a very low speed, as though it were cruising casually through the sky above the city, heading in a south/south-easterly direction.  However, the object was already almost out of site behind other objects when it caught my attention, leaving me only a very few matter of seconds to view its travel. As soon as I noticed the object, I turned off my music (a matter of a split second) and I heard absolutely no sound attributable to an aircraft. It may be of interest to the record that the city of Warrensburg is extremely near an Air Force base, and thus I have seen plenty of their aircraft, both day and night, including the Stealth Bomber.  In fact, I saw a low-flying Stealth Bomber just the night before, and so I was easily able to distinguish the object I saw from the aircraft typically seen in the area.;38.7668999999995;-93.7290999999984
