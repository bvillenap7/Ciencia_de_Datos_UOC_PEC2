Two UFO's observed over Warrensburg MO for 45 minutes in broad daylight.;1997-07-26 18:00:00;45 minuts;Two UFO's observed over Warrensburg MO for 45 minutes in broad daylight. During the late 1990's, I was on active duty in the Air Force, stationed at Whiteman AFB.  On the evening of July 26, 1997 I was washing my car at a self-serve car wash on the north east side of Warrensburg Mo. next to highway 50.  The sky was clear and there were still a couple of hours until sunset.  I noticed 2 dark objects hovering over the south-central side of town, about 2 miles away, at an altitude of about 1500 feet AGL.  The objects were identical, each consisting of an equilateral triangle with a sphere at each corner.  The thickness of the triangular portion was approximately one quarter of the objects' length, with the spherical sections' diameter about twice the thickness of the triangular section.  They appeared to be about 100 to 150 feet long.  The objects were flat black in color with no visible markings, intake/exhaust ports, or windows.  I could not hear any sounds from the objects.  The southern most object did not move at all, watching it was like staring at a photograph.  The northern most object only occasionally yawed from left to right about 60 degrees in each direction.  Its position in relation to the unmoving object never changed.  After about 45 minutes, I turned away to insert more coins in the car wash, and when I turned back, the objects were gone.  Less than a minute after the objects disappeared, three A-10 attack aircraft from Whiteman AFB flew over me less than 200 feet up, they were heading west, paralleling highway 50.  I could see that the only ordinance they were carrying were sidewinder air to air missiles.  The A-10s turned south and flew over the center of Warrensburg, towards the previous location of the objects.  At that location, they broke formation and continued south along slightly different vectors.  For the remainder of my Air Force career, I did not report my sighting, nor even tell anyone about it.;38.7668999999995;-93.7290999999984
This isn't about UFOs, it's about stuff our Air Force flys, that resembles UFOs.;2001-09-11 03:00:00;none really;This isn't about UFOs, it's about stuff our Air Force flys, that resembles UFOs. I am not here to report a UFO. I happen to live close to Whiteman AFB. Ever since Sept. 11, the B-2 has been flying non-stop around the skys. When the FAA grounded all planes, military planes flew around all the time. The B-2 flys over my house all the time, but does at 2 and 3am every single morning. I have noticed that the B-2 does weird stuff like hovers in the air and flys with out making a sound sometimes. I live outside of town, so I see a lot more stuff than some people see. I have also seen a lot of aircraft that I couldn't reconize. I know almost every single jet the US flys, but some of the ones I've seen lately are different from anything I've seen. One night there was these two jets that circled the town for about two hours. They looked kind of like A-10s, but not quite like them. they flew in some weird patterns, and I swear to this day that I caught one that was flying, stopped in the sky, and went in reverse for awhile. Well anyway, if anyone wants to see some weird stuff, come out around Whiteman AFB and wait for it to get a little dark.;38.7668999999995;-93.7290999999984
I saw what appeared to be a cloaked triangle object in the back drop of some strom clouds.;2006-05-25 20:01:00;0:04;I saw what appeared to be a cloaked triangle object in the back drop of some storm clouds. I went out to the back of my house to smoke a cigarette. As I looked up in to the sky storm clouds were coming in. I looked a bit closer and thought I saw a straight line going across the clouds. I thought it looked a bit wierd. I followed the line till it dropped straight down forming the back end of what looked like a triangle. As I kept looking I saw that the lines were moving. The clouds were moving as well but the triangle was moving faster. I couldn't see the object but only the outer edge where it met the clouds. As the object cleared the clouds and came into the clear sky it disappeared. Little by little the object turned into nothing. It appeared as if the object was cloaked some how.  I'm sorry if this sounds weird I would not normally report something like this and never have before but it scared the heck out of me. Please tell me if anyone has ever seen somthing of this nature before. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I'm sorry I forgot to add a small detail to my report given earier. This triangle object was massive.;38.7668999999995;-93.7290999999984
Triangle.;2014-06-14 22:15:00;4 minutes;Triangle We were driving down highway 50 and saw triangular shaped lights.  We tried to rationalize thinking it was probably a B-2.  But it was moving WAY too slow.   We then thought it was probably an antenna.  The problem was when we got closer, we observed that the object moved.  It was moving REALLY slow.  Approximately 10 miles an hour.  We couldn't stop, due to traffic, but we estimated it must have been as big as an eight story building.;38.7668999999995;-93.7290999999984
