White cylinder  fallowed  airforce jets for about 10 to 15 min. untill out of sight.;2001-05-15 19:00:00;15 min;White cylinder  fallowed  airforce jets for about 10 to 15 min. untill out of sight. Standing in a friends back yard, I was watching airforce jets from Whiteman airforce base flying west at about 10,000 ft. {maybe a little lower }. I looked behind the last jet about, 2 to 5 miles, and saw a white cylinder flying at what appered to be the same height and speed. I pointed the object out to my friend and he also saw it. He said it looked like a missile but the object was blunt at both ends and was flying at the same speed as the airforce jets. Also there were no tail fins or wings at all.
