Family members had left at approximately 10:30 P.M. after July 4th get together.  at  approximately 10:45 P.M. my wife and I were standing on the deck on the north side of our home.  Looking northwest we noticed a red circle or ball of light moving from west to the east at a slow rate of speed.  Approximately 200 yards to the north on our  property is a tree line that runs southwest to northeast, from this distance the object appeared to be about 100 to 200 feet above the tree line.  Standing on our deck looking north the object appeared to be at about a 25 to 30 degree angle.  The red orb appeared to be about the size of a quarter, very red in color, moving very slow from left to right, west to east traveling about the full length of the tree line.  The object exibited no sound and eventually faded from view, as if a light had been extinguished.   Our home is only 10 miles from Whiteman AFB Mo., but I am certain it was not any type of aircraft from the air b! ase.    I am a retired USAF NCO that has had 22 years experience working on U S Airforce jet aircraft.  Our home is in the flight path of the aircraft at Whiteman AFB, so I am well aquainted with the lights on different types of aircraft.  The object my wife and I viewed was certainly not a known type of aircraft.;38.7668999999995;-93.7290999999984
