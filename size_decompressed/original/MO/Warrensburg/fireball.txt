Orange balls of light,  Not lights on object, object was light. will be back July 4th.;2011-07-04 22:30:00;10 minutes;Orange balls of light,  Not lights on object, object was light. will be back July 4th. They are orange balls of light that show up every year, July 3rd but always July 4th. Here in Warrensburg Missouri on Montserrat Road that turns into Division Road about 10:30pm to 11:00pm.  2011 they went from east to west, but 2012 they went from south to north.  I call them fallen angels, I go an yell at them and tell them they will be cast in hell someday.  This last time the one ball of light I seen was by Montserrat Mo.  The moon this time was in the east, but the time before 2011 it was setting in the west.  It almost seem that those balls of orange light were going straight at the moon.  I would say they were less then 20 feet high over my head, and no bigger then a softball.  On July 3rd. 2011 there were two balls of light, but these were yellow with a red ring around them.  The yellow and red ones pass by my house two times  My wife seen the first one then later another one went by that My wife boy neighbor and I all seen.;38.7668999999995;-93.7290999999984
Just little balls of light.;2011-07-04 23:00:00;20 min.;just little balls of light. I seen these little orange balls of light no bigger then a softball. They moved east to west very slow, two passed over my head no more ten ten feet. I saw those two 7/4/11    But I seen another that was one 7/3/11 that was yellow with a red ring around the top part of it.  It was going north.  I had a guy in a town south of me looking too, he seen 14 of them on 7/4/11.   No sound from these things. ((NUFORC Note:  Video indicates a tiny white object, that seems to be drifting in the wind.  Might be an airborne seed, in our opinion.  PD));38.7668999999995;-93.7290999999984
