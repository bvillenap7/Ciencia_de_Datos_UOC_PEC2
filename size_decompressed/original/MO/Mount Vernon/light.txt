Alien Aircraft apparently watching me.;2007-11-28 09:45:00;1 hour;Alien Aircraft apparently watching me Me and a friend were driving through the back streets and we see a bright white light coming right toward us....we kind of shrug it off thinking its just a plane or chopper until it gets closer and freezes in the air, then looks as if it was moving downwards really slowy...so I stop and then suddenly it appears to be moving towards us very fast and it was then we realized it wasnt any kind of human craft...I throw my foot onto the gas and it shoots up about a mile or even 2 into the sky!  It then became golden and almost looked like a giant star but it was still moving...and as I proceed to try to make it home weird crackling noizes came upon the car hurting both of our ears....Note that also the clouds were very mysterious looking like a giant devils head...Scariest moment of my life!

The object appeared to be very bright, and approximately ¾’s that of the half moon that was also visible at the time and near the track of the flying object. The object was small in appearance similar visually to that of a high flying aircraft.  However much brighter in appearance, as said earlier.  The object also emitted no sound nor did it have any navigational warning lights as do aircraft operating in the United States. The object traveled across the sky quite slowly and appeared to stop for about one minute slightly West of Mount Vernon, Missouri, before it continued on it’s track to the South. The object was observed coming at me bearing 267 Degrees magnetic, and as it curved away from me its’ bearing was 162 Degrees away from me as measured on a engineer compass. The night was mostly clear and 45Deg. F. (7Deg C.), with a half moon showing, and a number of planets and stars. The entire sighting lasted about five minutes and the object appeared to gray out as it began to be obstructed by trees to the South of the witness.;37.1063;-93.7988
A light continued to blink in regular 8 -10 second intervals but doesn't seem to really be move across the sky for 2 hours now..;2019-12-25 00:00:00;2 hours +;A light continued to blink in regular 8 -10 second intervals but doesn't seem to really be move across the sky for 2 hours now.. It has slightly moved east in relation to the stars, but to me it is pretty much still in the same spot.  In other words, the stars are just simply that much further west due to the rotation of the earth.  Due to it being Christmas I unfortunately had to come inside.  At one point around 00:30 or so I saw what seemed to be another flashing light heading towards it from the E/NE.  It was brighter and actually resembled an aircraft due to the speed it was traveling and it was headed right towards this stationary blinking light.  Oddly, as soon as the aircraft looking light flashed one last time before intersecting the stationary flashing light from my viewpoint, the moving flashing light suddenly disappeared.  Yes, the moving flashing light completely vanished right at the point of the stationary flashing light...  I suspect it'll just stay there and keep blinking every 8 to 10 seconds all night all things considered, so strange... ...I really wish I could contact someone that could look up and also see it, that may have equipment to further investigate.  It was East/ NE of Sirius... i first noticed it right near Canis Minor and as time passed and the stars moved westward it moved past M67 and so on over the 2 hour span…;37.1063;-93.7988
