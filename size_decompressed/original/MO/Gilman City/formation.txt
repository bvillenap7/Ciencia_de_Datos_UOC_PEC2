Wide line of red flashing/pulsing lights which appeared to be at tree top level and about a mile across.;2010-05-21 22:35:00;10 minutes;Report taken by the Missouri Investigators Group:  http:///ufomig.yolasite.com   Wide line of red flashing/pulsing lights which appeared to be at tree top level and about a mile across.   All lights flashed in unison with about a once per second rate and had a slight flicker within the flash.  I drove west a mile toward the lights but after turning south to get to H highway I lost them and never saw them again even after continuing west on H to H & 13 where I got out and watched for several minutes.  These lights covered approx. SSW to WSW from my location and appeared stationary the whole time until I lost them.  I'm hoping to find others who saw them since this is very close to I35 and they could have been visible from there.;40.1413;-93.8306
