MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS REPORT:  Both lights came in higher then lowered to treetop level view although still many miles away.;2010-10-03 21:15:00;1 hour;Report taken by the Missouri Investigators Group    http://ufomig.yolasite.com   Two lights went from SE to SW of my location, one light faded out after going a little past straight south.  Both lights came in higher then lowered to treetop level view although still many miles away.  Both were kinda amber while they were E to S with the remaining light turning shades of green, bluish & red mixed with the amber and flashing brightly at times.  Light was very bright at times fading to just visible.  Went slowly back and forth in the SW and was heading back to the E when last seen, still pulsing in and out. Light was at least several miles SW of Coffey MO when I broke off  pursuit and headed back home where it was still visible for about 15 min. I went in house and came back out for several min but it was gone.;40.1413;-93.8306
