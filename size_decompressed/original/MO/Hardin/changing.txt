At 20:30, 20 min after sunset, I noticed something moving in the northern skies, got my Nikon camera, with 40x optical zoom and zoomed in to see what looked like dark balloons moving from north to south toward the town Richmond.  After about 2 minutes, it changed shapes several times as it approached some power lines in the west of my location, about 3 miles away, and appeared to attach something onto the lines and moved on down a hill alongside of the electric lines out of view.  I'm a retired locomotive engineer with many hours of observing the skies.;39.3504;-93.8409
