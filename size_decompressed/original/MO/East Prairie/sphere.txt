Orange orb floating low and slow.;2012-09-06 09:30:00;10:00;Orange orb floating low and slow. It was an Orange orb and at first it was off in the distance and I couldnt tell what it was, but it slowly moved toward us and was really low and we got an eyefull.  I looked at it and yelled at it but no responce. It then kept moving til it was out of sight moving from east to west. I personaly dont believe in aliens.  I believe it was an angel or something from the spiritual realm.  But unidentified it was. It was definatly not a plane. it made no sound at all and was very low.  I thought to myself, Hope it dont snatch me up.  Felt a bit of fear but was still too amazed to run in the house.;36.7794;-89.3685
