This thing was huge and it had alot of lights on the bottom of it evenly spaced.  It was like shaped some kind of rectangle and triangle shape together.   It made no sound and it was not extremely high in the air.  But it vanished quickly.  The way it flew was southeast from East prairie towards the DORENA HICKMAN area.  I was unsure of what I saw but it scared me.  What was it, does anyone know? ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.7794;-89.3685
