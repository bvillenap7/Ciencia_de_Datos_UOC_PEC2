Spotted an entity moving rapidly.;2001-02-19 21:30:00;less than 1 second;Spotted an entity moving rapidly. I was parked at a rest area just northeast of town on the Katy Trail watching an airplane touch and go (I think it was a pilot in training with the trainer). I had been sitting there for an hour or so just relaxing and listening to geese, owls, cows and watching the airplane. I had rolled my window down and laid in the car sideways with my head resting partially out the window so I could see the sky. I saw a polar satellite go by at one point. I also saw a meteor which appeared to come from the constellation Cassiopea moving towards the west. I was thinking about leaving when I spotted a dark object moving from the southeast to the northwest rapidly. It didn't appear to have any lights and made no sound. It was in sight and out in less than 2 seconds. Needless to say I had a hard time getting a fix on it. It was about the width of my pinky finger one inch from my eye. This object appeared to be less than 1000 feet high. Here's what spooks me... it looked like it was alive. It looked more like an entity than a craft which is why it changed shape. NOTE: My wife and I have seen one of these before a couple years ago flying over Sedalia in the evening. It moved a little slower and was illuminated by the city lights. We were baffled. She thought maybe it was an angel... I'm not so sure. Has anyone seen anything like this? Surely I'm not the only one.;38.6921;-93.2383
