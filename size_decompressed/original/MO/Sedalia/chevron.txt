Initially the UFO was sighted as slowly moving from west to east, nearing our location, while suddenly it stood still for a prolonged period of time, approx. 15 sec before flying at incredible speeds from east to west, with something close to a trail of light lying briefly in its wake.   The lights that had shone from the UFO were aligned together in a horizontal fashion, flashing from blue to red colors with varying patterns and distances in between each other.   It then went back to the west, continuing movement in that direction before it slowly descended below the horizon.;38.6921;-93.2383
