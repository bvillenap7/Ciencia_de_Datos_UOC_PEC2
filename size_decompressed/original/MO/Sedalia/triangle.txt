Triangular shaped craft over Sedalia, MO;2009-03-28 23:00:00;2 Minutes;Triangular shaped craft over Sedalia, MO Me and a friend of mine went outside around 11:20 to take out the trash and observe the wintry weather we are experiencing here.  We were standing in the alley behind my house, near my girlfriend's car having a cigarette when I noticed the strangeness.  There where three identical lights in a triangular form moving at a fast pace across the sky, due west I believe.  From my point of view it was about a few miles from our position and maybe 25-30,000 feet up, appeared quite large in the sky and was completely silent. I could almost make out a blackish shape within the lights.  The lights where solid, no strobes or emergency lights where visible. About a minute later we witnessed what appeared to be two military jets flying the same direction and could be heard.  The jets had the standard lighting most airplanes have when flying at night.  I live a few miles away from Whiteman AFB and have seen hundreds of B-2 bombers and I believe what I saw was not a B-2.;38.6921;-93.2383

My self and my cousin was standing by a three way moving spot light, at this time we looked up we saw a double edged triangular air craft with multiple lights along the edges, the color of the lights looked regular color of a light, there was a few red lights on it but i cant remember their location on the craft.  The craft was about 100 ft over this business and it was at 12 am so it was a pitch black night, the air craft made no noise at all.  I tried to take a picture of it while it was there for the three or four minutes but was unsuccessful.;38.6921;-93.2383
