Object over south Kansas City, MO. Lights on bottom, flying low.;1975-07-01 20:00:00;2-3 minutes;Object over south Kansas City, MO. Lights on bottom, flying low. I was about 10-11 years old playing in the front yard with some friends.  I don't rememebr how my attention was drawn to the sky, probably by someone else.   I looked up and observed a low flying craft approx. 1000-2000 feet up.  It was large but I only vaguely remember the outline being circular or oval in shape.  What drew my attention was a circular formation of lights underneath alternating colors.   I do not recall any other lights on the object.  Our house was just 5 miles north of Richards-Gebauer Airbase so seeing aircraft was common all times of day and night. This would have been about the time that the base was slated for closing but the military traffic continued well past from when I moved from the neighborhood several years later.   The object was moving roughly from the northwest to the south east.  I rememebr someone saying Looks like the UFOs are landing.  I totally freaked and went inside the house.   That was the last I saw and I never talked about it over the years.  I had convinced my self that it was something normal, possibly a blimp.  Just recently I contacted my brother and asked him if he remembered the event and asked about the detatils just so I coudl verify that I had not missed soemthing after I went inside.  He related that he did remember, he would have been about 12-14 at the time.  He remembered the object as silvery with lights on the bottom but no other lights.   It was low and he and other(s) (Unknown who the other kids were) went in the backyard as it went over the house.   He remembers the object turning to the North and he watched it until it was out of sight.  He distinctly remembers thinking that the object definitely was not an aircraft.   pointed out the possibility of a blimp and we both agreed that that we had never seen a blimp in the area before (Especially due to the presence of the airbase) and we were very familiar with the aircraft that frequented the base since we alsways tried to identify the aircraft by the sound they made as they approached for a landing. This object made no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Freight Pilot Sees Rapidly Moving Oval Object Near Kansas City, MO.;2002-07-02 02:15:00;3 minutes;Freight Pilot Sees Rapidly Moving Oval Object Near Kansas City, MO. I am a air freight pilot that flies smaller, twin-engined aircraft at night. I am building experience to fly for the airlines. I saw something strange on my way out of Kansas City International Airport the other night, July 2nd, delivering my load of freight. I have ALWAYS been one of skeptism and thought UFO's were bogus lies from people with nothing better to do....until now....... I saw a solid oval, NO blinking lights, or colored lights, moving rapidly across the sky from EAST to WEST. I've seen thousands of satelites before and I know for sure this was NOT a satelite. Why?? Because this object was about the size of a dime moving across my windscreen/windshield. Also, it travelled from directly overhead (where I intially saw it on climb-out), to slightly above the horizon (about 1 thumbs width with your arm stretched outward) before I lost it in the haze. The object travelled this total distance in less than 3 minutes time. My estimate - 250 to 300 miles. It had a soft, medium, white silouette light which illuminated the entire object. I was climbing out of 4500 feet at the time......my guess was that the object was in excess of 50,000 feet. I inquired with ATC, to see if I had any potential conflicting traffic, he panned his radar out to include all altitudes, and then he said nothing was on his scope execpt for a few low altitude targets that were in bound to K.C. International. The ATC controller and I both laughed a bit over the frequency about it and then nothing was said. It has been at the front of my mind, each day, since I saw the object.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Blue football of light seen over Kansas City near Claycomo;2009-04-14 21:00:00;10 sec.;Blue football of light seen over Kansas City near Claycomo Around 9pm on 4/14/09 I was heading home from a friendâ€™s house, when I saw one of the most beautiful and amazing sights I have ever seen. I was smoking a cigarette, just cruising down the highway when I looked up through my windshield and saw a ball of light. Once I focused in on the light and saw that it was not a plain, it shot of into the westward sky.  It had a tail almost like a comet.  I have never seen anything move so fast in my life.  It looked almost as it disintegrated.   I was not a believer until last night, I do not do drugs, nor was I drinking.  What I saw was real.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
North Kansas City UFO;2011-11-14 17:40:00;2 mins;North Kansas City UFO I had some street lights on Barry Road turn off right before I noticed the object in the sky.  I saw an oval object with lights all around it hovering on top of the Macy's at the Metro North Mall by 169 highway.  It was stopped there and not moving for about 2 minutes, then took off heading towards Southwest.  It was going very fast but it went from being really low to up.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Bright red objects over Raytown.;2013-11-22 17:30:00;5 minutes;Bright red objects over Raytown Looking north from my couch coming directly from the direction of the stadiums, I saw what first looked like a plane that may have been on fire, the light was bright red and moving about the same pace a small engine plane would move only no sound and seemed to be floating instead of actually flying.  I used my binoculars and I saw what looked like an orb with fire in the center heading due south....and just as that one disappeared in the distance another appeared following the exact same path, and looked exactly the same. I've never seen anything like it, and for the life of me can't think of anything that can fly man made that I can compare them to.

a glowing oval with two flashing lights and a light ring.;2020-05-28 22:35:00;25 seconds;a glowing oval with two flashing lights and a light ring. the UFO I saw was an oval with a ring of lights at the bottom that went right-to-left, there were also two blinking lights in the middle on the left-center of the craft. The craft itself was glowing a whitish yellow. I saw it in between two massive trees. I saw only one and I believe that I was the only witness because I have heard no one else admit to seeing one. it was a three-quarters moon, therefore the sky was bright and I had a clear view of the sky around it, there were no clouds.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
