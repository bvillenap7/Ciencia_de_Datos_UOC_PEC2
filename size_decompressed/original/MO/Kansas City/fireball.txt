falling satellite;2001-12-13 22:25:00;10 minutes;falling satellite this is in response to many reports on this same date in that same area, it was my 18th birthday so I remember it very well, and i saw the same thing reported by many others' in missouri, the next day I recall reading about and hearing on the news that it was acutally a japanese communications satellite that came down.  as I recall it was like 3 long blazing trails all parrellel with each other stacked vertically with several orb shaped objects intermixed between and around the three trails.  We watched it and it was silent.  You can probably check news reports from december 2nd about the object.  oh yeah, and a friend of mine called the hotline this evening cause he saw the number on the tv on public access in columbia missouri, and he left a crazy message around 7:00 p.m. central time, please disregard it, he got excited and decided to screw with people on the hotline.  I'm really sorry about that.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Shooting stars that changed direction.;2003-10-18 21:40:00;less than 20 seconds;Shooting stars that changed direction. I was sitting in my hot tub looking up at the stars and relaxing. I saw what I first thought to be shooting star come slowly into sight, moving quickly from slightly SW to slightly NE. It was visible long enough for me to think Oh, shooting star, cool....look at it go and then it slowly vanished. I had enough time to think That was cool... when an object came into sight at about the same rate but moving from NW to SE. It immediately struck me that this quite likely could be the same object but with a changed vector of about 45 degrees. It quickly disappeared from view. I sat and contemplated this for a bit and had decided a shooting star could hit the earth's atmoshphere and change directions when a 3rd object appeared moving from the North to the South but this object appeared to make 4 S curves before disappearing. At this point I checked the time with it being 21:45.  There were no aircraft in the area, nor did I spot any satellites.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Large white object came into atmosphere and broke up into 5 smaller objects over Kansas City, MO;2011-08-19 21:00:00;2 minutes;Large white object came into atmosphere and broke up into 5 smaller objects over Kansas City, MO While driving southbound on I-29 highway north of Kansas City, MO, my driver and I saw what looked like a large round white fireball coming into the atmosphere.  There was a long white trail following the main object that was headed downward.  As the object got lower it appeared to slow down, the trail of fire disapeared and the object broke into 5 smaller white objects.   These objects seemed to stop falling, spread out in the air and hover for approximately 10 seconds before disapearing behind trees and the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed quite sober-minded and eloquent.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.  PD));39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Orange fireball crosses the sky in Kansas City.;2011-10-01 21:43:00;60 seconds;Orange fireball crosses the sky in Kansas City. At 9:43 pm a bright orange light, approximately 10 times larger than Venus appeared in the Southwestern sky. It traveled Northwest 20  degrees for about one minute.  The orange fire like glow pulsated consistently for about 55 seconds.  Then the light pulsated to nothing in the last 5 seconds.  The height was about 20 degrees from the horizon.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Unusual fireball-like orb moving in the sky, and suddenly disappears;2011-10-01 21:43:00;45 seconds;Unusual fireball-like orb moving in the sky, and suddenly disappears As my friend and I sat facing the south western sky we both saw a reddish orange light perhaps 5 times larger than any star moving westward horizontally  at an irregular slow speed.  Neither of us had seen it's likeness and as we watched it it appeared to flicker as if on fire, moving sometimes closer (larger) and farther (smaller) away from us.   After about 40-45 seconds it entirely disappeared.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Large Red Object.;2012-03-24 23:50:00;120 seconds;Large Red Object. At about 11:50 PM Central Standard Time. Large glowing red-orange object moving north to south.  Looked almost circular but just slightly oval shaped. Longest axis parallel with the ground.  Shortest axis Perpendicular to the ground. Sighted originally at the approximate location on google maps:    http://maps.google.com/maps?q=n.+woodland+and+100th+street+kansas+city&hl=en&hnear=N+Woodland+Ave+%26+NE+100th+St,+Kansas+City,+Clay,+Missouri+64155&gl=us&sqi=2&t=h&z=16  Object disappeared at about 11:52PM near the missouri river I435 and Front Street:   http://maps.google.com/maps?q=435+and+front+st+kansas+city&hl=en&ll=39.139913,-94.491692&spn=0.082814,0.117416&sll=39.090101,-94.510574&sspn=0.165745,0.234833&t=h&gl=us&hq=435+and&hnear=E+Front+St,+Kansas+City,+Jackson,+Missouri&z=13   Object size looked to be about size of a USA 25cent piece 'Quarter that is placed 12  from a human eye with 20/20 vision, at the initial spotting location.   NO noise heard.  No aircraft wing, tail, or landing lights. At or near the Kansas City Metropolitan Community College Maple Woods Campus, Object seemed to be gaining elevation and still heading south.  No other lights but the consistent red-orange glow was observed.   We can observe elevation due to a consistent white glow of the city that goes about from the horizon to about 30 degrees above horizon while facing due south. At or near the final location of spotting, the item seemed to be turning due east.  Then item disappeared.   Final size was about the size of a USA 10 piece Dime that is placed 12 from a human eye with 20/20 vision.    No shape of a craft was observed. Spotted it all most directly overhead near the initial location above.   Initial thought it was a shooting star, but after watching it for 20 seconds I realized it was not.   My father was watching the documentary about the guy who got eaten by the grizzly bears and I called him out to observe it with me.  We watched the object for about a full minute or more together as it moved across the sky.   We thought it was a burning plane about the size of a Boeing 737, but realized it was gaining height and  there was NO aircraft wing or tail lights.  Looked more like we were looking directly at the exhaust of a rocket.   No exhaust cloud was observed.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Red flashing orb/fireball seen near Front St. in Kansas City, Missouri.;2013-11-19 20:00:00;30 minutes;Red flashing orb/fireball seen near Front St. in Kansas City, Missouri I was driving South on 435 from Liberty to Front Street exit to meet my ex and pick up my girls and noticed a red flashing light.  At first I thought it might just be a very bright light on a radio tower but as I got closer I could see it was not attached to anything and was 3 or 4 times higher than the towers around it.  I parked the car and watched to see if it was moving. It was moving very slowly straight across the sky and then would stop and move the other way.  It flashed on and off just like the lights on top of the towers.  I watched it for 5 minutes and then decided to get closer underneath it, so I drove to the train yard it was up above. It stopped flashing and was just a dim orangish, red color, and I could barely see it against all the street lights when I got close to it a couple minutes later.  I drove back to the spot I parked at and couldn't see it anymore.  A white light had appeared in that direction and looked like a plane coming in for a landing just to the north of Front St. and right off the highway.  I'm not too familiar with the location but I know there is not an airport.  It is very industrial and has lots of trains and big warehouses around.  I don't know if it landed or not because it disappeared behind some warehouse building.  I told my ex about it on the phone but by the time he showed up it was all over.  I know others had to have seen it because the highway is right there, and I could see it coming down 35 and 435 from Liberty.  I could see it the whole 15 minutes I was driving down the busy highway.  I have seen fireballs before that were white and red and orange but none that blinked like this one and possibly landed.  There are a lot of UFOs around Kansas City and Branson area where my Grandma lives.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Parkville, MO, very bright fireball landing slowly.;2015-03-12 21:00:00;5 minutes;Parkville mo, very bright fireball landing slowly. We were on a hill walking down, and we looked in the sky and at first I thought something was on fire like a small plane, but then I realized it was going way to slow.   My friend thought it was just a plane at first but not that much farther away there was a plane and trust me the very bright fireball that we saw was not any kind of plane.   It started slowly getting a little bit closer then it just starts lowering all the way to the ground like it wasnâ€™t even there.   About 10 minutes later we saw a helicopter go by.  It was really creepy.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
