not starlink;2020-07-14 04:50:00;4 minutes;not starlink I saw what people are calling starlink in the northeast sky close to excelsior springs and they were coming down slowly to land on the earth.  Almost straight down, semi-evenly spaced stars. it could not be starlink, they were not falling, they were decending slowly. i could not see the ground where they were heading.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
