July 11, 1979 was the night that Skylab came down.  Me, my older brother and some neighbor kids spent the night outside hoping to see Skylab come down.  We were camped out of the patio on the East side of the house and didn’t have any kind of view of the Western sky at all.  (We were kids I was 12, not real smart).  Anyway in the middle of the night I was looking straight up when I saw directly above but miles up in the sky a red arrow.  It was crisp, no streaks, exhaust or noise.  It was moving directly East and was only visible for 4 seconds.  The other kids of course were screwing around and missed it.  It was gone before any of them could get a look and of course they didn’t believe me.  I assumed at the time that what I saw was Skylab but now I’m pretty sure it was something else, I just don’t know what.  I’m really hoping others saw the same thing and know what it was.  If you know what this was you can just e-mail me, I really don't expect a phone call or for your organization to spend a lot of time on this.  Thank you.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

About noon on the 21st of Oct.  1999, I was driving towards the west in my truck when I noticed a very bright object in front of me about 20 degrees up from the horizon. The object looked almost rectangular, it's width appeared 1/3 that of it's length. Upon closer inspection, I could see that the object was a very bright white. It's ends were rounded. Upon arriving at a middle school, the object was still visible. Three additional adults joined me, to witness the sighting. During the time we watched it, two airliners flew above and below, and were dwarfed by it's size. Slowly the craft moved South, and entered the end of a long narrow cloud. We waited several minutes, but the object never emerged. Upon speaking to a friend later about the incident, he confirmed that he too had seen such an object at approximately the same time of day, and location as I had.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

It slowly entered a large cloud and disapeared.  It seemed to be two to three times the size of a jet liner.  Two jets did fly over and under it, but evidently didn't see it.   Its white color probably blended with any clouds that were near.  The cloud that it entered was huge, but was only 1/4 as wide as the craft which seemed maybe 1,000 ft. X 300 ft.if it was a disc, it would have to have been tilted quite a bit to have shown such an exposed face which had no shadow to speak of.  Bright white and possitively Not a baloon or derigible! I was driving to eat lunch when I noticed the thing in the sky.  When I saw that it was virtually standing still or was moving very slowly, I raced to the middle school and ran inside to get some other witnesses.  Three people came out and I said now somebody tell me what that is!  Nobody could identify it, but we all agreed that it was not a conventional aircraft.  Upon entering the cloud, the others went inside the school to go back to work.  I of course had to stay, never taking my eyes off of the cloud. In four minutes, I noticed that the cloud had moved to the right with the wind ( the object had gone from right to left) and something very bright was now moving away into the distance very fast! It soon disapeared at a slight angle upward.  Art bell was correct in stating that people only see these things when they bother looking up!  I wonder what else I've been missing all these years...oh yes, as the object slid into the cloud, and the haze slid around it, It took on a grey or metalic color. the shape was oval or cylinder.

I saw the weirdest thing I have ever seen in the sky.  I saw what I first believed to be a star.  However, about three seconds into looking at the star it disappeared.  I then noticed this same light reappear several miles to the Southeast of where I first saw it.  Then the light disappeared again.  The next time I saw the light was about five seconds later.  The light was almost exactly where I saw it the first time.  I thought this was odd flying for an aircraft, especially at this odd hour of the morning.  It almost felt like the object knew or sensed that I was watching it.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
