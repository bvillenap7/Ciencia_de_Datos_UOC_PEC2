Large light blue sphere, made no sound, and no light reflected off of it.;1979-12-31 22:35:00;2 MINUTES;Large light blue sphere, made no sound, and no light reflected off of it. I just picked my mom up from work we were driving down our own street, and all at the same time we noticed a very large circular ball it was light blue in color, and was hovering over a local park (Loose Park), there was total snow covered ground, what I notice was there was no light reflecting off the snow, I could not belive this. I never believed in ufo's befor this night.  as we drove near the object it raised up and started moving away from us then it just shrinked up to a small dot and zoom away very fast it left a white streek in the sky,  My mom kept saying we need to call somebody about this, I reminded here that it was new years eve and that no one would belive it.  None of us where drinking at or befor that time. The following Monday I asked my astromer proffessor at U.M.K.C. If he believed in UFO's or alien life outside of our solor system, He responded that you would have to be extremly arrogent not too. I believe now.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

On December the 25 at about 1:25 in the morning after coming out of midnight mass, my  mother and I was driving back home.At first we thought it was the moon, it was like amber glow.But as we were driving we notice that this so-call moon was following us, since we were alone on this street. We also notice that is amber object was coming closer and closer to us. My mother have the nerve the say, go out there and see what is that,I said,HELL NO. I told my mother let's go home,she wanted,to go down the street to the police station and report it. So as we got near the station another man came by too,and question want was in the sky.So by that time there were about six of us looking and pointing in the air. But someone must have call the police, because there was a helicoper in the sky circling around it. And the helicopher stop circling, and stop in mid-air like helicopher do. And a surreal thing happen it went away, did'nt even break the silent. So I told my mother,if she mention this I would deny it, if course she mention it and I deny it. But after all these years it still bother me. Now my mother has pass on, and trying tell sister,and my sons no one believe me.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

I was sitting on my car, smoking a cigarrette on my smoke break at work.  I looked up and saw what I first thought was a satellite, although it seemed to be too large, moving from due west to due east.  I watched it for a total of 15 minutes, noticing the following events: Repetitively stopping and starting, speeding up and slowing down. A final stop, a pause, then a change of direction to the northwest.  It then took off at a higher speed than any noticed before. I then got up because my break was over.  I started walking inside the building, turned around to see if the object was still visible.  It was not. The object was very high up in the atmosphere, if it was at all.  Bluish-white color.  Round shaped, resembled a star but no twinkling.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

Orange Glow over Kansas City seen for 20 minutes.;2005-09-26 20:00:00;20  minutes;Orange Glow over Kansas City seen for 20 minutes. An extemely bright firey orange light was seen just hovering in the sky for about 20 minutes.  The object did not move or flash or change in any way.  I was at work taking a cigarette break when I noticed it.  It was too high up and too far away to be a helicopter with that intense of a light plus the light was a lot larger than any aircraft light I have ever seen.  I work at a hotel and I stopped a guest to get thier input and they too thought the same about it.  The guest stayed to watch it for about 5 minutes with me and agreed it looked suspicious.  I was called inside the hotel to check in a guest and when I got back outside around 8:30pm it was gone. The only detail I have on the object is that it glowed extremely bright orange and hovered with VERY little movement from side to side.  It was awesome!;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

Bright blue light (brighter than a star) slowly blinking about every 7-10 seconds, but not at regular intervals.;2014-10-05 21:30:00;2 minutes;Bright blue light (brighter than a star) slowly blinking about every 7-10 seconds, but not at regular intervals. Craft moving slowly from east to west, exactly at midpoint between zenith and horizon (at 45 degrees, if zenith to horizon is a 90 degree angle).  Because of the bright moonlight, craft was still viewable when not emitting the blue light - craft was a dull darker grey.  As time passed during the incident, the intensity of the blue strobe-like light diminished before craft disappeared behind trees.  I could not clearly discern how far up it was but it seemed very high up in the atmosphere.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Disappearing/reappearing dot in the sky, going down.;2016-08-17 21:00:00;15 seconds;disappearing/reappearing dot in the sky, going down. At around 9 o’clock PM CT, I was outside enjoying the night air with my sister and looking up at the sky. Surprisingly, we could see a lot of stars.  Even more surprisingly, I saw what I thought was a falling star.  It was circular and white. It looked like it was falling straight down, but when I followed it with my eyes for a few seconds, it disappeared - not something your average meteor does!  And then, a moment later, it reappeared, lower than before, and kept falling.  I was very excited, and pointed it out to my sister, who quickly saw it.  It was too far away (sadly too far away to film or take a picture of) and going too fast to be a plane, or anything like that. It disappeared again, and this time I counted.  It was 4 seconds, and then it would reappear for 4 more seconds, and then disappear once more.  This went on for a good 15 seconds, and then whatever it was disappeared from our view, behind some trees.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

I quickly ran outside and observed the 2 objects in the northern sky roughly 30 degrees above the horizon.  I retrieved my binoculars for a closer inspection and the 2 objects were actually ring shaped.  They were bright white glowing, not moving at all.  After about 20 minutes of observing they were obscured by clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  High-altitude balloon?  Please see other reports, going back to June 18 over Ohio.
