Black, triangular object sighted during middle of day in large metro area.;1995-05-20 13:30:00;10 minutes;Black, triangular object sighted during middle of day in large metro area. I had just been to a job fair held inside a large hotel at 46th and Main.  It is situated on the top of a large hill in the center of the city. I walked out the back entrance and was enjoying the weather-clear blue skies and 70 degree warmth-when I noticed what I thought was a stunt kite due to the shape of the object.  I watched it for a few minutes wondering where the individual was who was flying the kite when it tipped over, and became a sliver of black, perpendicular to the ground.  It appeared to circle around the city but was very hard to follow because it was so thin.  I got to my car and tried to drive to where I had last seen it so I could get a view from underneath but I was never able to do so. When I first saw the object it was angling up into the sky.  After it reached a height far above the rooftops, it tipped over.  It was probably as big as my thumbnail with my arm extended.  I couldn't hear a sound and kept thinking that I should hear *something*.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

Silent triangular shaped craft observed in daylight;2002-05-02 19:45:00;Two minutes;Silent triangular shaped craft observed in daylight On Thursday, 05/02/02, at 7:45 PM I stepped outside on the balcony to watch the sunset. I live near a small airport and frequently see small aircraft like Cessna's and corporate jets. The weather was clear with a few very high scattered clouds. After several minutes of looking up I observed to the south of me a triangular shaped craft flying from south to north. I estimate it's altitude at about one half mile and the distance from me of less than one mile. I could see it clearly. The craft itself was triangular with rounded corners, dark in color, didn't reflect any sunlight and made no noise that I could hear. I would guage the size of it to be similar to a large commercial aircraft. The surface that I saw appeared to be smooth without any lights on it. When first seen I thought it was a kite drifting on the wind but it flew smoothly in a straight line, not erratically like one expects a kite to do. It flew slowly enough that it was in sight for at least two minutes. During this time it maintained a steady flight path and did not change it's altitude or distance from me. I finally lost sight of it to the north due to the edge of the building I was in. While I was watching this craft a small Cessna took off from the airport and reached an altitude of about 1500 feet going south/southwest. The engine on this plane was easily heard. It appeared to be about midway between the ground and the triangular craft but closer. I should note that there are several military bases to the southeast of Kansas City. Perhaps what I saw was an aircraft from one of them. I've seen the B1/Stealth aircraft in flight at distances of a 1000 feet and the craft I saw yesterday evening was a little different. What impressed me the most was the rounded corners, total lack of noise, it's shape and that it didn't reflect any sunlight at all even though it was in the light of the setting sun. There are lots of small aircraft the use the nearby airport and Kansas City International Airport is about 30 miles north of my position. I assume the craft was tracked on radar by both of them and was visually observed by others on the ground and in the air. I am ((deleted--40 + year-old)), college educated, an((military)) veteran, worked many years in the ((medical)) field and am currently state certified in ((public service)). I've never experienced any kind of visual hallucination, don't drink and don't do drugs. I currently hold a responsible management position. I've been on a number of military bases, had flight line clearence but have never before seen a craft exactly like this one.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
brite triangular shaped object hovering over hiway 435 in Missouri;2003-06-08 23:00:00;15 min;brite triangular shaped object hovering over hiway 435 in Missouri We were driving south on highway 435 from St. Joseph Mo. about 10 miles from the Kansas state line when myself and my 2 passengers asked each other what an object was that we all had been watching unknown to each other for about the last 10 minutes. It was about 11:00 pm on sunday June 8,2003. The object appeared to be about a quarter of a mile away and was large and very brite. It looked very big, about the size of a football field, the top surface seemed to be covered in very brighy lights. The lower side was dark with rotating red and blue lights. We stopped on the highway, got out of my van and watched the object for 5 minutes, it just hovered not moving. After about 5 minutes it started a very slow foeward motion, it went over a hill and straight down and disappeared. At no time did we ever here a noise, engine, propellers, or any sound.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
It was triangle in shape with bright white lights on the vertices of th triangle with a red glowing light in the center of the triange.;2004-05-31 22:30:00;30 seconds;It was triangle in shape with bright white lights on the vertices of th triangle with a red glowing light in the center of the triange. I was driving down 152 highway when I saw a group of lights in the sky very close to the ground, I would say 300 to 400 feet.  I got closer as I drove and noticed it wasn't moving, or it was moving towards me and I couldn't tell.  I got next to it, or at an angle where I could see it, and it was triangle in shape, black, with bright white lights at the vertices of the triangle.  It had a glowing red light at the center of it and it was just hovering over a subdivision of houses.  I kept driving, though I really should have stopped, and as I drove by it I saw it hover over the highway away from the group of houses.  That's all I saw of it before I was too far away to see detail, only light.  It looked like it was moving towards Metro North Mall.  I'm not sure what county that is in, that's why I didn't provide it in this report.  I am guessing that is part of Kansas City, Missouri, but it could be in a different city close by.  I was on my way to Liberty, Missouri when I saw it.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Triangle Flyover Surprise.;2004-11-08 03:33:00;3 minutes +/-;Triangle Flyover Surprise. I had taken my dog out and she was going about her business.  I noticed it was abnormally still-normally alot of activity(QT and all night car wash and I am by two Hwy 152 and Hwy 169.  It was strange and I was thinking about that then continued to look around- and started to look up overhead, towards the left-I 'sensed aspatial disurbance and was observing it when it 'uncloaked' and became visible.  It was very low in relation to me and I am in parking lot by interstate, the building is 3 stories tall.  It seemed so incredible I couldn't believe it and re confirmed but it disappeared(blink of an eye) then reappeared, re-cloaked, uncloaked then cloaked where I could approximate the trajectory but could not physically see it.  It was so quiet I couldn't believe what I had seen.  I have seen stealth3,4 times.  I have seen a few photos of 'triangles' and one video with some sound-this was neither.  It appeared very dark blackish or some deep reddish tone to it, when I could id a triangle shape and movement it seemed like it was not in a power up mode-it had a faint slightly luminous perimeter and throughout the triangle body there was a non random pattern. but equilateral spacing like dots on a triangle-seemed odd but it was faint and it moved with no resistance that was apparent, NO engine sound at all!  I felt surreal, like it was like a  symbiotic type ship-organism and I was being 'introduced'-without a face to face meeting-preparing me to accept this.  I think I might see them again and I do not know if they are harmless or harmful.  I felt mentally racy but like the physical was in slow mo, excited/unsure, scared with the unfamiliarity but not threatened to run off-but I was not trying to signal this ship either.  felt like a dream state, somewhat disorienting but handled calmly.  Like a time displacement effect-if they can exist. I have worked with MRI and resonance and know there are subtle shifts a body would feel and this ship had an effect just not sure what.    When I could visually make out the ship then in a moment the faint light/luminousity would manifest.  Then it would drop in intensity a little then more and so on.  Still in awe;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

Location: I-435 hwy & I-35 hwy Intersection (facing south towards downtown K.C.) An object with 3 circular white lights and a long tail of white sparks that came very close to the ground,  appeared out of nowhere and rapidly flew straight east to west and then went straight up into the sky. At first, I thought it was a shooting star, but then as it got closer to the ground, did I realize what it was.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Slow moving triangle shaped craft. Size of 2 or 3 football fields.;2008-11-24 21:00:00;90 seconds;Slow moving triangle shaped craft.  Size of 2 or 3 football fields. I was outside walking my dog at night.  Some movement above me caught my eye.  I looked up and saw a triangle shaped object sillouted with the sky as a background.  There were no clouds so the sky was dark.  The triangle was moving at a slow rate of speed maybe 2000 ft off the ground. It continued to fly at a slow speed until I could no longer see it.  The bottom of the triangle had 5 to seven lights along the leading edges of the bottom.  The lights were a bright white light.  The rear of the triangle did not have any lights. I live in the flight path of the KCI airport and see planes every day and night for the past year and a half that I've lived here.   I have never seen this before. And it was completely silent. I have also seen stealth fighters and bombers but they have normal blinking lights like other jets.  Plus they make very loud jet noise when they pass over head. I work for the Federal government as an attorney.  I was previously a commissioned officer in the United States Navy.  I was formerly an assistant District Attorney for Jackson County Missouri.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Saw a thin and long triangular shaped object with red and green lights.;2011-11-27 21:30:00;approx. 5-10 min.;saw a thin and long triangular shaped object with red and green lights. At around 9:30pm I heard a strange noise outside, it sounded like a very low flying plane.  I went out the front door (which faces the west)and saw a low flying triangular shaped aircraft with flashing red and green lights.  At first I thought it may be something like a stealth aircraft because the Chiefs were playing at Arrowhead on this night, but then I realized most stealth aircrafts do not make noise nor do they have flashing lights.  The strange thing about this object was that it was flying just above the tree tops and it stopped and hovered for approximately 2 to 3 minutes then it did a 180 (while it was hovering) and took off at a pretty quick speed.  When I looked to the north I saw a helicopter coming at a high rate of speed toward the aircraft (we have a police helicopter station within a mile of my house),but the aircraft just seemed to vanish leaving the helicopter to just fly in circles around my neighborhood.  I guess the thing that really has me questioning what this object was is that back in the latter part of August I was walking up our street and saw the exact same aircraft hovering above the school up the street.  On this occasion my neighbor was returning home and saw it also.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

Triangular Lights spotted over downtown Kansas City.;2017-06-20 04:22:00;Unknown;Triangular Lights spotted over downtown Kansas City. I live in Kansas City, and was with a few of my friends at this monument that over looks the city when I took a picture on Snapchat.  I swiped right a couple of times to find the right filter, posted it and kind of forgot about it.  That is until I looked at the picture again later that I noticed something I hadn't seen before.   In the upper left hand corner, you can see 3 faint lights in the shape of a triangle that I am 100% positive were not stars or a plane or anything like that because we didn't even see the lights with our naked eyes.  There is proof its not just a filter or smudge or anything because you can see a plane in the upper right corner of the picture.   I decided to put the picture through a few other filters on an application on my desktop and could make out a kind of rim that was connecting the lights.  Although I'm not very proficient at photo editing.  What do you think?  I'm pretty spooked myself.  Maybe someone who is more proficient at photo editing could get a crack at it.   If you have any other questions feel free to reach out to me. ((NUFORC Note:;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
