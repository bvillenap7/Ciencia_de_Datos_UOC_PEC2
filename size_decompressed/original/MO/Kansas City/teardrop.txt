the object,while lit, flew faster than any plane I've ever seen.;2003-10-06 22:53:00;5 seconds;the object,while lit, flew faster than any plane I've ever seen. I looked in the sky as I was driving down a semi-lit street, and saw a bright light flash from one side of the object to the other. The light bent on the object as if it were curved or raindropped shape, and as if the object was spinning or turning. When the light got from one side to the other, the back side of the object was facing me and as it did, the object dimmed and shot at LEAST 20 miles across the sky and disappeared...... It was a crystal clear night, so it didn't disappear into any clouds.... I instantly called my house to tell my fiance what I saw, as soon as I began to say hello, the weirdest noise shot through my cell, she told me she heard it on her phone too.  I was only 1 mile from home. The noise sounded like radio frequency, but was only a second long. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and found him to be quite credible.  He felt quite certain that the sighting had not been caused by an observation of an advertising light streaking across the sky.  Conditions were clear, with no clouds.  PD));39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
On 2/6/9 I saw a very fast moving black object with a rounded front and small tail in the sky. It disappeared behind a cloud.;2009-02-06 10:00:00;10 seconds;On 2/6/9 I saw a very fast moving black object with a rounded front and small tail in the sky. It disappeared behind a cloud. On Friday,  Jan. 6th, 2009, I was traveling by car from Kansas City, MO to Sedalia, MO along I-470E/US-50E and I saw a fast moving black object  in the sky several miles ahead of me. It had a rounded front and a small tail. It caught my attention because of how fast it was moving and its shape. I watched it for approx. 10 seconds before it went behind a cloud. I waited for it to reappear on the other side of the cloud, which it never did.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
5 objects viewed during landing approach to Kansas City MO airport MCI;2012-08-26 20:15:00;1 minute;5 objects viewed durning landing approach to Kansas City MO airport MCI 8/26/12 at 8:15 pm on approach into Kansas City (MCI) airport from Memphis, flight touched down at 8:25 pm ct.  Observed 5 metallic dark silver tear drop objects with red glowing interior as it passed above large radio broadcast antenna and below our wing.  Tried to make out if it was another aircraft, determined it was not as there were no wings or rotors.  If it was suspended or supported from the ground and could not see that.  The objects were very close to the plane 100-200 feet and closer to the plane than the radio broadcast antenna.  Do not know what I saw.  A white light appeared at the end of one of the objects.  Plane flew over them and they were gone out of sight from my window.  They were moving at and angle slightly away from the plane while the radio antenna stayed in a constant left to right position, so I determined the object was not attached to the ground and moving away from the plane meant they were flying, basically our flight path did ! not “make” the objects move as the ground objects moved.  They were in the air and in formation.  I will email a image that I have mocked up of what I saw, as my camera was turned off for landing.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
