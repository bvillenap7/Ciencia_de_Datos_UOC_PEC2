Symmetric geometric shape, black with blinking long red lights.;1977-04-26 18:05:00;30 seconds;Symmetric geometric shape, black with blinking long red lights. My childhood friend and I were playing a game of catch with a baseball in our neighborhood.  The ball went over our heads and up the street.  We both ran after it to see who could get it first.  We got to the ball at the same time.  Neither one of us touched the ball, we were both distracted by what we saw ahead of us in the sky.   We were looking south and there was a Catholic church across the road from our neighborhood.  What we saw looked like it was perched on top of the tall pointed steeple.  I quickly realized that what I was seeing was actually miles away from us, and it had to be very large.  It was a very unique geometric shape, unlike anything else I have ever seen.  It was taller than it was wide.  It was very symmetric in shape.  It looked like a tall triangle was sitting on a mirror and the top point had been cut off about 3/4 of the way up, so it had a flat top and bottom.  It also looked like two more shorter stubbed triangles had been placed on either side of the object directly in the middle tapering out.  It appeared that the object was black and it had what looked like red flourescent light bulbs on it that followed the same pattern as the outer edges of the shape.  The lights were blinking on and off in a random but slow pattern.  The sky in the background was pure blue without a cloud in the sky, so the object was very distinct in the sky.  It seemed to hover in place for about thirty seconds and then started to slowly rise and move away.  Then it suddenly bolted faster than my eyes could keep up, I just remember knowing that it had traveled faster than anything on this planet could ever go, except maybe a bullet. My friend and I just stood there with our mouths hanging open in awe at what we had just seen.  We looked at each other for a few seconds without saying anything and then I said Did you just see that?.  He said yes.  I told him not to say anything to me about what he saw, just to go home and write it all down and draw the object.  I then told him that we would compare our notes the next morning when we were on the bus for school.  Just for the record, I only new to do all of this because the TV show 'Project Blue Book' was a series on TV at the time and I had seen the Air Force investigators on the show tell people to do that, so they could buid a more credible case.  Anyway, we both went home and wrote and drew what we had seen.  I told my parents about it, but of course they were not going to believe a little boy telling such wild tales.  The next day my friend and I compared our notes and drawings and they were identical.  I have never forgotten that event nor have I ever seen any other drawings or pictures that looked like the object we saw.  I have always wondered if anyone else saw that object that night.  I also want it to be known that I am not sure of the exact date that this took place, but I believe that I am fairly close to it.  If anyone out there saw this, all those years ago, please post your sighting so I will know that my friend and I were not the only two that saw this amazing sight.

On a december night head lights approached us. Then shot into the sky.;1989-12-01 19:00:00;5 minutes;On a december night head lights approached us. Then shot into the sky. My family and I were searching for the Metro North Mall. We are from Saint Joseph and were not familiar with this area. It was sometime around Christmas. We were shopping for presents. We ended up on a road that lead us somewhere around a open field. It was night and  we saw headlights approaching us. My father did not know how to get back on the highway, so he was going to wave the other car down and have them tell us directions. My father came to a stop and waited for the other car to pull up. Except it stopped about 25 feet infront of us. That is when we notice that the head lights seemed to be floating in the sky. After a few seconds my father pulled a little further up, and the lights raised about 15 feet in the air. My step-mother freaked out at that time and opened her window. She thought that it may of been a helicopter( I have since lived by a hospital that life flights out and know better). There was absolutley no sound what so ever. Not even a car motor. It remained there for about a minute and then it raised a little more.  Then, suddenly it shot kind of diagonal into the sky. And eventually straight up and out of sight. I would like to put that the speed that it traveled was amazing. Not helicopter like at all. I do not know if it was from this world or not but I do know what I saw. What my whole family saw.

MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  I was looking to my left when I spotted a white light about 9 o'clock high;1999-10-15 19:00:00;3-5 minutes;It was October or November 1999 when the KC Chiefs were playign the Seahawks at Arrowhead Stadium and the game was held up due to lightning. I was baout 10 miles east and a little north of I-70 on 39th streeet. My wife and I had just come out of Independence Center heading for Oak Grove our home. We always take 39th street to 7 highway south. We just passed Salsa Rd. I was looking to my left when I spotted a white light about 9 o'clock high and I couldnt rememebr if there was a tower in that direction. It was very cloudy and very dark, so I looked back forward then my curiousity took over and got the better of me so I looked back and saw two windows, then looked back down the road and at first I thought that the blimp was up, but then it hit me that because of the lightening, rain and wind that nothing would be up and flying. Now I looked back and left and paid closer attention to the windo3ws. This time the first thing that struck me was how wide they were but the odd thing was just how narrow they were. They didnt seem that high off the ground and hanging in a cloud. They were 6 to 8 long and about 1/2 high and very bright but not like headlights. I saw no beam, but more like a room light up with bright lights, where you cant see out but people can see in. I thought I saw movement behind the lights but that could have just been my eyes playing tricks on me. I watched them for about 3 to 5 minutes before I turned on to 7 highway south and lost sight of them. I felt a little fear as I watched them and I dont know why I never asked my wife to look at it. I wish I had.

Large area of bright objects with falling across the atmosphere from Southwest to Northeast in Missouri above Kansas City;2001-12-01 22:25:00;1 minute plus;Large area of bright objects with falling across the atmosphere from Southwest to Northeast in Missouri above Kansas City We saw several large bright white objects with trails of redish gold sparkle. It looked like a satellite I saw fall across the sky several years ago. It went from Southwest to Northeast and lasted for over a minute.I contacted Columbia Flight Service Station in Missouri and they said they had had one other report from Someone in Maryville Missouri with the same description. I am a Pilot and Instructor and felt obligated to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.

Two clusters of four black blobs floating and moving at dusk.;2004-04-25 21:00:00;5 minutes;Two clusters of four black blobs floating and moving at dusk. I just experience this 15 minutes ago and I'm still trying to figure out what it was.  It was approx. dusk.  From my window I could see a very odd black mass in the sky, possibly I thought a bunch of balloons but it was floating in a non-balloon like manner if that makes any sense.  I went out to my porch to look at it more closely and it was just sort of hovering there.  It seemed quite dense.  It was approximately 1/4 the size of the full moon.  It looked like it was moving higher and getting smaller.  I ran to get my video camera.  When I got back, it looked like it was very faint in the sky, but I have zoom on my camera so I tried to frame it.  I managed to frame it briefly and it looked very very odd.   Two clusters of four black blobs all floating around in a semi-symetrical manner.  Then, after 1 minute total of filming, my camera battery died.  Which is very strange, as it was on the charger when I brought it onto the balcony.  I continued to look but it was almost invisible at this point.  What I thought might be the cluster (at this point just a dark point) seemed to be approached slowly by another black point in the sky.  Then it got too dark to see anything.  No light emitted by anything to my eyes.  A very strange experience.  It could have been a cluster of balloons released, but they didn't seem to move straight up when I first saw them.  They seemed to move lateraly.   A very freaky experience.  I can try to upload the video (it was a digital camcorder) if you are interested.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Orange flare-up - plane shaped.;2004-04-26 13:35:00;Less than 1 minute;Orange flare-up - plane shaped. I was driving along Highway 169 between 68th Street and Barry Road and somthing in the sky caught my attention. I saw a orange ball in the sky, and looked and it appeared to be an airplane. It went out of my sight, and then about 5 seconds later I saw another orange flare-up. Appeared to be comming from the underneath of the object. Object proceded to disappear from my view after second flare-up. It was in broad daylight, so I ruled out the possibility of the landing lights right away. The sun was overhead, as it was 1:30 PM.. so it could not have been a refraction of the light at an angle. There was no report of any airplane problems on the evening news, or on the FAA website at the time this event occured. Object far too low to be a spaceshuttle re-entering the atmosphere - less than 2000 feet above the earth. Moved a bit faster than a commercial jet.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Convoy crosses Kansas City sky.;2004-12-04 23:00:00;3 minutes;Convoy crosses Kansas City sky. I was standing in the parking lot on the west side of the Arrowhead Stadium after the Big 12 Championship on Saturday night.  Two lights appeared behind the stadium on the south side and crossed the sky from south to north.  The objects appeared as rings of fire/light separated by a constant distance and moving in the same direction at jet-like speed.  It seemed as though one craft was towing another behind it. A few seconds after the two lights disappeared in the north horizon, identical lights appeared again behind the south side of the stadium and follow the exact same trajectory.  A few seconds after these two lights dissappeared, a third set of lights crossed the sky, following the same trajectory as the others.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
a star shaped metallic object with lights at the points;2005-07-11 03:00:00;15 minutes;a star shaped metallic object with lights at the points i and a friend , in a state of frenzy, during a distubance. i felt we should leave. upon leaving i began giving directions to a place that i didnt really know, or know why. upon the last of my directions , we saw two lights in the sky ,white, very low ,maybe 50 ft up. i shouted stop the car. he pulled over and got out as i did. the two lights multiplied into 8-9 , and the craft began to take the shape of a star, with yellow,blue, and red lights on the end points. as it flew over i actually saw the silver metallic structure. it was unbelievable, i had never seen or heard of a craft of this shape. i can only explain it like the ship superman was sent to earth in the first superman movie,starring christopher reeves. we stood there paralyzed by the sight. it began to move away so we hit an adjacent road, and up into the middle of a corn field, yeah sounds corny huh, no fucking way. we stopped in the road made up the middle of the field. we got ontop of the car as the craft changed shape and then landed. then what i can only describe as 'tornados' of red, blue, and yellow light came shooting up out of the field. I,only me, then heard a voice say ' your friend makes us uneasy''. I asked him if he heard it , he said no, then i heard rustling in the field. the voice repeated. then i became sick and threw up instantly. after releiving my stomach of its contents, i turned around and realized i was about 100 yards from his car. from what i remember i only took at the most 5 steps from the car. How did i get so far away from the car? i cant even comprehend how i got that far away. At this point i knew any further contact was not going to happen because of the presence of my friend. i went home and tried to draw the object, it took several tries, until one made me sick to my stomach and throw up again. i still cannot look at the drawing or anything similiar without getting sick. since electronic devices i have seem to be malfunctioning all the time, one in mind, thats very annoying , my smoke detector, yes i checked the battery, replaced, checked again, but still it goes off with sets of beeps primarily 3 sets of 3 beeps , then 2 sets of 3 and 1 of 2. My tv changes channel by itself ,volume as well. i have talked to a neighbor i hadnt met and he said his tv was actually moving physically, by itself. he said he had marked it and tested it several times,and it still moves. his smoke alarm goes off now too. I can feel when the ship is close , its here every night, just off to the west every evening and night moves , flickers its lights and then disappears instantly. when i saw it the second time from a distance i felt a little sick, but not as bad, i then asked it aloud please blink twice, for me, just to prove im not crazy or paranoid. i got what i asked for and seemed to engage in a conversation with someone not there.   i have advice for all,  MONITOR YOUR SURROUNDIGS,AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, KEEP AN OPEN MIND. until recent month i have not noticed anything but once you notice, you notice alot of wierd shit happening, everywhere, at all times,. THIS IS REAL. THE PUBLIC WILL EVENTUALLY KNOW, IT CANNOT BE STOPPED. OPEN YOUR FUCKING EYES EVERYONE. OPEN YOUR EYES PLEASE. FOR YOURSELF. i cannot stop the chain of events or the weird shit happening , but i can accept it and not be afraid anymore. no more fear, no more wars,....my ideas,and experiences are the only pure things now, i am at peace for the first time in my miserable 27 years of life , im not scared anymore,. WHY ME? i dont know. if you dont believe in the story , its your agenda, i cant change that. but you will see it like i do whether you want to or not , eventually,..

Bright lights seen in Western sky moving very slowly from SW to NE.;2007-05-07 20:10:00;45 minutes;Bright lights seen in Western sky moving very slowly from SW to NE. On Tuesday night at 20:10 I went out on my deck for a minute and I spotted three bright lights in the Western sky.  There was one light on the left and another slightly lower and to the right and the third was directly right of the second.  At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on.  The object was almost stationary.  I watched it for a total of 45 minutes and in that time it moved extremely slowly from SW to NE and descended at an angle.  The object passed behind a tree and as it was emerging from behind the tree the lights went out and I did not see it again.  On Wednesday night I was in the kitchen at approximately 20:10 and looked out my window and saw the same lights.  I got my digital camera and tried taking pictures using the RAW format.  The object moved in an almost identical flight path as the night before but this time the lights did not go out and after an hour it disappeared below the tree line on the horizon.  The light never changed in intensity or position the whole time they were visible.  They did appear to be coming toward to some degree.  There was never any sound or apparent turns.  It moved in a straight line path from high left at sighting down at about a 30-45 degree angle until it went below the horizon at lower right.  The pictures I got only show a light and not all three.  A large tree provides a reference point to show angle of travel.  The lights were seen by two other witnesses, my wife and my neighbor who is a local fireman.  I served 8 years in the US Air Force & US Army and was a police officer for 6 years.  I have not seen anything like this before.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Aircraft that can explain some of the sightings;2012-07-31 23:00:00;12 minutes;aircraft that can explain some of the sightings This is not a UFO  but an oddly lit aircraft that might be the source of some of the UFO sightings in the Kansas City region. The aircraft about the size of a 747 with yellow-orange lights running down the body of the aircraft from the nose to the tail. The lights are extremely bright compared the the normal aircraft lighting from the cabin windows being open and the typical lighting on an aircraft. Spotted the aircraft moving north to south and looked like a glowing orange cigar shaped craft at about 20-30 miles out.   Plane then tuned  and flew directly over my house and clearly make it out as an  aircraft. Not sure what aircraft it was, but had quad engines and wings under under the body.  Body length about the size of a 747.    Could not clearly make out the body or any markings as the lighting was too bright.      Aircraft was not in a landing approach to MCI or from a take off at MCI.    Looks like its flying around.  Changed directions and started to head to Kansas City Kansas about 1 or 2 miles from my house.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

Just finished work and got home petting the dog around 4:45 am last Wednesday morning when I looked up west just south of downtown Kansas City and it looked like the back to the future tire streak so it was two things very fast like warp drive initiation mixed with back to the future but it was not fire and it was not a shooting star, very strange.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Worming ribbon object moves through the kansas city sky.;2020-12-14 21:30:00;30 seconds;Worming ribbon object moves through the kansas city sky. While outside smoking, my boyfriend got excited and pointed to the east and asked me, wth is that?  I look over and this very strange long thin line that almost looked like a lace ribbon was moving like a worm across from east to south east. It was illuminated with multiple lights, very lightly visible almost as if they're all a piece of this long ribbon. There were hundreds of these lights and the way this thing was moving was nothing we've ever seen before. From where we stood, the length of this object covered majority of our visible eastern direction in a horizontal line, I can't even begin to estimate its length. After worming across to the south for a few seconds, it began to shift going eastern and from then became impossible to see. While this object/objects began shifting direction, he noticed a drone coming from the west that approached and slowed drastically before maneuvering south extremely slowly and maintained a steady position circling the southwest. Using my AR flight radar, the drone is actually an unidentified unit, typically meaning military or police of some sort. The timing and they're continuing area trace makes this quite intriguing.  I snapped some photos, haven't looked at them yet to see what exactly is visible, if there turns out any somewhat decent I shall send an email. Hopefully we weren't the only ones to see this. Definitely a new object I've yet to ever hear or see.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
