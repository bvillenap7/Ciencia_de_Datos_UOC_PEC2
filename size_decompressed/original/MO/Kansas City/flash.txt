flash of light over kansas city;2009-03-01 03:30:00;7 seconds;flash of light over kansas city driving along 35 south off of southwest blvd, and large flash, like before a nuke goes of in movies goes off in the southern direction. Lasted at least 7 seconds if not more from the time I noticed it. looked for it in news and nothing for some reason didn't think about it much untill the meteor that almost struck earth march 2, and realized i had forgotten such a huge sighting. I think it's connected to our so called tenth planet B52.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
