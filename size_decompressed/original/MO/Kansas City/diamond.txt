Huge UFO, Enters Midwest Sky, Streaks of brilliant light that were spotted from Texas to Kansas City, on Saturday night I was driving on the Kansas when I saw this huge UFO in the sky! I heard on radio that night, theat  lights from the Oklahoma border to near Kansas City. I can tell you itwas not space junk.  Very, bright light that crossed the horizon from southwest to northeast and broke. The press is lying. It was a clear UFO. It had four long streaks with objects, in front. It looked like a armada of UFOs.It appeared to break up into about 30 little balls, all white, broken up in the atmosphere. NORAD monitors satellites and space debris that re-enters the atmosphere. I also know they catalog all space junk, even, small items. How come this got by their detecton? These objectsthe night sky was especially clear, and moving fast. I was on vacation in the area in Kansas City, where my cousin lives. I never seen anything like it before. It seemed so wizard of Oz, yet so spectacular, but real! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs. (Mountain) on Saturday, December 01, 2001.

All the ships were moving indepently and then they conected and then move at the same time;2012-07-12 03:00:00;2 hours;All the ships were moving indepently and then they conected and then move at the same time We saw many ships, in the fist 45 min we saw these trinagle and dimond shaped ships about 5 or 6 of them moving back and forth rappedly, turning and moving to the east. there were these red and white flashing ships that were zig zagging and moving around other ships like that. it look like there were lights coming out of it to.there also were white dot ships that were doing the same thing and moving very fast. Next about an hour into it there were clouds moving to the east farly fast during this period i could see a few bigger triangle shaped ships and many small ones. Once the clouds move to the east fully clearing the sky and i could see these big dimond shaped ships, it looked like they were triangle shaped ships attaching to the bigger dimond shaped ones, and had small ones moving in and out of the main ship.  saw atleast 10 bigger ships moving tword one another, and then sundly the stop and all the ship started to move at the same speed at this time they were going back to the west. While this was going on the clouds stop moving to the east and started moving to the west.i could still fully see the ships moving to the west.there was a tringle ship that disengaged from the main one and then rotated counter clock wise and took off. the small ships were still what looked like going in and out of some thing. I could see the out line of a diomond ship didnt see much of it but the outline. so about an hour and a half into it there a cloud about to cover up but then stopped and some how was kinda moving in a circle. i saw these three black dots in the sky that went behind a small cloud and the the cloud fadded away. There was one of the small red and white flashing ones that was low enough that i could see the outline of it. it was a smaller circle one but it didnt go the full 360 it kinda looked like one of the ufos off of independce day. At one point when the clouds were over us  we saw this ship that looked like a glass circle going very fast through the sky. The reson why i think that they attached to one main one is that i could see perfect tringles and there all were moving at the same speed.  We saw many ships that would just take off and couldnt see nothing but a small light moving accross the whole sky. At the start of it they were not moving at the same speed they all were scattered and moving in weird ways with smaller ones zipping every where. the whole night i could not see any of the stars that are normaly here at this time and did not see the big dipper once.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
