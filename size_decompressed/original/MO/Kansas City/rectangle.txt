It was moving fast from left to right. I was traveling southbound on I-435, near mile marker 57.2.  I saw a moving object super far out above the tree line while I was operating my car,  I could tell it's far out because the amount of haze around the object.  Trapezoid shaped, no lights at all (not even blinking).  It was moving fast from left to right.  Than vanished behind the tree line.  I couldn't make out much . It was a greyish brown (?) metallic color, it was before sunset around 6ish.  But it was moving extremely fast but too large to be any type of plane.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
