Kansas City MO/ Independence MO lights and configuration night sky sightings;2011-08-19 21:07:00;1 1/2 minutes;Kansas City MO/ Independence MO lights and configuration night sky sightings 08/19/2011 21:07 In Northeast Kansas City MO driving West, in the Northern part of the night sky.   Saw approx 5-6 small, but bright white lights that would perform coordinated synchronized movements and make shapes such as triangle and diamond. When these small bright white lights moved, they would each leave a small lit trail from their last position.  Sometimes, there would be two together at once forming the synchronized shapes. 08/19/2011 21:45 Heading home driving south in Independence, MO saw a large, long thin object with different colored lights moving eastward.  The lights were multicolored, but there was a large section unlit, and the very tail of the other end was partially lit.  This object was moving at a fast pace.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Very loud sound from the sky as from something huge, with nothing in sight.;2015-03-31 22:30:00;6-8 minutes;Very loud sound from the sky as from something huge, with nothing in sight. I heard a loud sound similar to a helicopter, only either extremely close or extremely large.  There is a railroad track a few miles from here so my girlfriend and I listened closer and it was for sure NOT a train we hear trains all the time but not usually at night.  I left my porch to look for this huge helicopter and did not see anything as the sound got louder. It was so loud at one point I'm sure I felt the vibration.  It was coming from the sky and there were no helicopters in sight.  For how loud it was I should have seen one landing.  The sound seemed to be from something really BIG.  It lasted a lot longer than something passing by.  It seemed to just get softer and not farther away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright white light appearing to move, with several blinking lights next to it.;2015-05-06 23:00:00;10 minutes;Bright white light appearing to move, with several blinking lights next to it. As I was looking outside of my window, I saw a light (brighter than a star) among the clouds.   Just as I was about to look away, I saw the light move up and left for about 15 seconds.  This light was surrounded by several other smaller lights that appeared to be stagnant, but blinking blue and white dim lights rapidly.

Then a humming rang inside my head and I put my ear against the back for and could hear something outside.   My dog cowered inside her kennel (pitt bull so she's not scared of anything)  I  opened the door and all the car lights were on even though the keys were inside!  Next thing I know I shut the door and it's 2 hrs later.   Today I have a very weird bad headache.  I've experienced missing time before but I had a dream about seeing a ufo that night.  I don't remember having a dream this time.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
