A brilliant, greenish light that suddenly appeared within a grey cloud overhead.;1970-05-15 16:00:00;ten seconds;A brilliant, greenish light that suddenly appeared within a grey cloud overhead. when I was a very young man, I and two of my friends were standing outside our Jr.High school talking. It was on the last day of class of my ninth grade year and school had been over for about 30 or 40 minutes. As I was listening to the other two guys talking, I was gazing up at the clouds overhead. All of a sudden, I saw a very bright light suddenly just turn on within a cloud allmost directly overhead. The light appeared to be moving within the cloud because of the way the shadows shifted within and without the cloud. The light appeared to be of a greenish hugh and moved slowly for about 10 seconds, then as suddenly as it had appeared, it just went out. For some strange reason, I never brought it up to the attention of my two friends who were still talking to each other. Indeed, I passed it off as a flare to myself and thought little of it afterward. Two other incidents in my later years have brought this incident into the context of a possible UFO sighting. One was the sneezing of a BB like object out of my left nostril that struck the palm of my hand and then struck  the passenger window of the car I was in with a loud click like metal on glass. The other was a daylight sighting of a cylindrical object that I reported to your center as having occured on Oct.21st 1999 in Kansas City, MO. It is no longer a question of if there are UFO's. It is now a question of what are they here for? I am 48 years old now and am an archaeologist and a former armored cavalry officer. I do not have moments of fantasy and know what I've experienced.

Followed about two minutes later by similar light, traveling in same direction. At approximately 9:58 pm I went outside to investigate what at first sounded like thunder. There were approximately four loud booms.  I looked up to see that the sky was cloudless.  I told my roommate thunder doesn't go boom, boom. While looking up I saw the first light, about the brightness of Venus, traveling from WNW to ESE.  I thought it strange that there appeared to be only one light and no other blinking lights.  There was no sound of a jet either. I ran in to get my binoculars but could only make out a vague, black silhouette whose shape was not readily apparent.  I told my friend to come outside but by the time he made it out the object was out of sight below the tree line. As I was walking back to the house I looked and and saw another similar light. I said Look another one.  It traveled in the same direction, at the same speed. I got a good look at this one with the binoculars and saw no flashing lights, the vague, black silhoutte against the moonlit sky.  I saw both lights for approximately 15 to 20 seconds each.  They traveled in a straight line, again no sound that I could detect.  At about 10:02 pm I hear two more explosions about twenty seconds apart.  I have no idea what the loud booms were. Fireworks maybe, from nearby casinos.  There was nothing on the local news to explain the loud booms.  And, I have no reason to believe that they were associated with the flying objects.  Just a strange coincidence.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Craft with red,blur & green lights almost on the ground at tree top level lights bigger then a house & very quite seen by myself &;1999-06-11 23:00:00;5 minutes;Craft with red,blur & green lights almost on the ground at tree top level lights bigger then a house & very quite seen by myself & I believe it was 6/11/1999 it was around 10:30pm I was heading to the store with my 2 sons in Kansas City (north) Missouri (Crestview area)I turned left down the hill & at the bottom of the hill we all saw it, Tree top level, it was behind a house but so much bigger, it had red, green & blue lights. The lights where bigger then the house, it was so big! We stopped got out & just stared at it for like 5min.  It was so huge I couldn’t be leave what we were seeing , 1 light was bigger then the house it was behind the house blocked a tiny spot of the bottom of I think the green light, but the light was still bigger then the house & it was almost on the ground that’s how low it was, it looked like it was in the back yard. We couldn’t really see how big it was but from where we was standing you could normally see the highway that is very lite up & trees & the huge church & parking lot , the price chopper,plus the fountain beyond the overpass but you could tell the ! craft was beyond huge because you couldn’t see any of those things, it blocked all of it & that was over 5 or more blocks that are very well lite up.We didn’t hear anything but maybe a light hummmm. Then it was just gone, that fast, didn’t even see it leave just gone & everything was as it always is, you could see the highway overpass & everything. We never talked about it after that night until last summer 2018 I asked my son if he remembered & I got so excited when he said yes he & his brother had been talking about it, I don’t know why I didn’t report it, I figured it would be on the news in the morning but it never was. I remember it as clear as if it was yesterday! I can sit down and draw a picture of what we saw & do some Research if you are interested & write me a letter and give me a form to write each down. I can go take pictures of the street house it was behind and what you can see from the way we was standing I can take a video and explain it as I remember it and give directions facings if interested in that it’s not far from where I live now. Please send a letter and I can call you back or leave a message;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Light flies across sky, then turns at an angle upward and disappears.;2001-09-10 20:55:00;30 seconds;Light flies across sky, then turns at an angle upward and disappears. My husband and I went outside to smoke.  We were sitting there talking and this light caught my eye.  We live near an airport so we are very use to seeing planes, but this caught my eye for some reason.  As I asked him if he seen it, and he started to answer yes, the light moved at an angle upward and then just poof was gone.  I thought at first the light might have been a plane flying low, but the quick movement of it in the upwards direction told me it was not just any old plane.  Has anyone else seen anything like this before, and if so, have you found out what it was?;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
3 bright lights at high altitude west of Kansas City at 2100 hours on 10/1/01 in a general westward movement.;2001-10-01 19:00:00;15 minutes;3 bright lights at high altitude west of Kansas City at 2100 hours on 10/1/01 in a general westward movement. 1 bright light was observed behind a commercial(?) airliner heading west of Kansas City right at dusk, about 7:00pm, central time.  The light was moving forward (west) and slowly down, with the jet and behind it.  It appeared as though the light (object?) was dropped from the plane, and shortly thereafter the plane gently veered slightly to the north.   My first impression was that it was a star or planet.  My secon impression was that it was a military test of some kind.  2 more lights were observed a few minutes later, more toward the north, but in the same apparent altitude.  We also thought that they might have been smaller, lower flying business type jets.  Because these objects were definately moving, they couldn't have been stars or planets.  The 2nd or 3rd light spotted, at one point, moved very rapidly straight up.  The airplane contrail was at least several miles long, but none of the 3 lights gave off any sort of contrail of any kind.  We observed them for a total of about 15 minutes and they eventually disappeared because of the darkening sky and their apparent westward movement, in the general direction of the plane.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Two extremely bright, large, white lights, one slightly ahead of the other, slowly traveled from the south to the north directly over;2002-02-02 05:24:00;1 minute;Two extremely bright, large, white lights, one slightly ahead of the other, slowly traveled from the south to the north directly over While walking my dogs, I looked up into the clear night sky and noticed two extremely bright,white lights, one slightly ahead of the other, slowly traveling from the south to the north directly over my house. There was no noise, although they were only three or four thousand feet up. The lights didn't change in there appearance while approaching or receding like the lights of an aircraft would. There were no colored running lights of any type. Just a constant titanium white light like a flare. As the objects receded, they entered some very low lying clouds, which filtered out the white light, giving each the appearance of a single orange/yellow pinpoint of light.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

Shiney parallel objects seen over KCKC and then KC north.;2007-07-11 08:45:00;2 minutes;Shiney parallel objects seen over KCKC and then KC north. Driving on I-29 near Barry road I saw two shiney objects that I thought were airplanes passing each other near the downtown airport and Kansas City, KS.  They never crossed and stayed parallel stacked vertically.  They glinted in the sun light like chrome in the sun.  Then I couldn't see them anymore.  I looked to the west and they were about 500 feet in the air and were horizontal.  Very shiney, but couldn't really make out a shape.  I thought they might be balloons from a car dealer, but they were over a residental area/wooded area.  They were stationary.  Soundless as far as I could tell.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
linear formation of 6 to 7 bluish orbs moving from north to south in the approximate location of Blue Springs, MO;2010-10-29 18:30:00;10 minutes;traveling east on I-70 around 630PM on Friday, October 29, 2010, we witnessed a relatively low level very linear formation of 6 to 7 bluish orbs moving from north to south in the approximate location of Blue Springs, MO.  There was a haze between the object, my son said 'that object looks like the Phoenix lights'.  The line of orbs was followed by what appeared to be a helicopter, flying above and behind the line.  As the linear formation traveled further to the south, the orbs scattered, became very bright and then disappeared.  A couple of helicopters circled the area for some time after.  There was a lot of traffic and others must have encountered this formation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

I was walking in a park on a high hill at more or less 11 pm.  I didn't think too much of it.  I often observe the night sky.  There was a haze due to water vapor in the sky. I saw a light beam originating from a point almost due South sweep Esst to North.  It swept about 120 degrees.  It was like those powerful lights they shine up into the clouds like at a store opening or event they want to attract people to.

I knew it wasn't a plane as it was low enough, below the clouds that I would have heard the engines.  Also, the light was not blinking.   I stopped and listened thinking it might be a helicopter, but again, no noise and no blinking lights.   As it disappeared, I shrugged it off.   A few minutes later, there were six more red lights, all traveling together slowly and quietly below the clouds, but spaced erratically and at different altitudes.  Again, they were low enough that I would have heard engine noise.   They flew in the same direction and eventually disappeared out of sight.

Yellow and white light falls to Earth, breaks to pieces/seperates and turns to all white lights;2014-07-24 03:15:00;1;Yellow and White Light falls to Earth, breaks to pieces/seperates and turns to all white lights I ended a phone call and went to the balcony to smoke a cigarette.  I sat down on the chair, light my smoke and looked up. I saw a yellow whitish light moving at a decline towards the earth and immediately thought UFO.  At this point, my instinct was to record with my phone, but it was in the house.  I proceeded to the door to get my phone, looked back to make sure I wasn't crazy, and saw the light.  I was fascinated, so I was in a gaze.  Moments later, the light broke into pieces and turn into a white color and fell towards the Earth light fireworks at a big display.  As the white lights fell, it disappeared. This was not a firework.  The angle it was traveling and the speed would make it impossible to be a firework.  This object fell from the sky and towards the Earth at an angle that would make it impossible to be.  Only other explanation would be a meteor falling to Earth and breaking up.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

Strange lights that fly in unison blink out when observed.;2016-04-23 05:00:00;30 seconds;Strange lights that fly in unison blink out when observed. Early this morning, I got up and went out on my back deck to enjoy the beautiful morning weather and night sounds.  It was still dark and the sky was clear.  I sat down for about 2 minutes, then looked up at the stars.  I don't know the constellations, but I could clearly see several points of light without any obstructions.  Directly in front of me (facing northwest),  I could see a group of three stars immediately flanked by two other lights to my right.  At first, the two lights were stationary so I didn't really think about them.  But soon they both started to slowly move from their stationary position to my left.  I thought it odd that satellites would be still and then move in apparent unison.  With my right arm fully extended, I estimate they were a hand width apart.  Very high up but still very clearly visible.  I watched them move slowly in unison, then stop in unison, then resume moving in unison in the same direction.  They followed their motion f! or approximately a five count, then the lead light simply went out, while the second light continued to move in the same direction.  When the second light reached the point where the first light went out, it too went out.  No clouds, no obstructions at all.  I'm an avid UFO person so naturally I interpreted this as a possible sighting and said out loud why do you always blink out when I see you?  How do you know I'm looking at you?  I thought this might illicit some kind of response, but they didn't reappear.  I've been fooled by birds before, but these lights were too bright and way to high to be birds.  I ruled out airplanes because they went from stationary to moving and I didn't hear any jet-related sounds like normal when a high flying jet passes over.  Helicopters don't go that high, or I'm not sure why they would, and again no noise.  Perhaps some kind of experimental craft that can go stationary, then move with no noise.  Just seems odd to me.  I've seen! these lights before and always just as I notice them, they bl! ink out. This pattern of seeing them, then they disappear suggests to me whoever they are, they know I'm watching them.  It's happened too many times to be coincidental.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

5-6 Satellite LOOKING objects flying in trail formation maintaining constant speed, heading and distance. ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-06 05:15:00;15 minutes;5-6 Sateillite LOOKING objects flying in trail formation maintaining constant speed, heading and distance. NE of Kansas City At 0515 CST 10 Miles North of MCI (Kansas City INT'L Airport) I witnessed 5 to 6 objects flying from the NW to NE. All objects were North of MCI airport flying in a trail formation. The Objects were a solid white with NO strobes or any dimming. Upon seeing the first in the string of 5 It appeared to be a low orbiting satellite. Then I saw number 2, then 3, 4, 5 and possibly 6. They maintained a constant speed to stay the same distance between all of them. If I was guessing (from my POV) they were at 40-60,000 FT AGL and based on their size and speed, they were ALL maintaining approximately a 2 miles separation from each other.  But again they looked like satellites and from everything I have seen and know with an 18 year career in Military Intelligence satellites do not fly in a trail formation with only minimal separation between them.  They looked like satellites but were so much brighter and I have NEVER seen satellites traveling in a trail formation (especially) not traveling in a group or trail formation. Each object was maintaining the EXACT path as the previous as I was able to use a star behind them to verify the flight path .  As they moved further East they dimmed until they were out of visual sight. I called the Tower at MCI and have been checking ALL flight record sites to see if anything was up at that time and have not found anything.  I have NEVER seen anything that I could not explain. IF they were Military aircraft (as we have Whitman AFB East of us and Omaha North) they were NOT showing the common single red strobe or solid red light.  Further more they had NO sound that one would hear upon observing a high altitude Aircraft and with the weather being cold there was NO contrail.  If I had only seen one, I would have said it was a satellite. But 5-6 in a row all maintaining a perfect trailing formation with each other leads me to believe that they were not Satellites.  I am continuing to call the MCI Airport tower and see if they picked anything up on radar as well as look at every flit tracker I can find for this time of morning as I have NEVER seen anything like it.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
