On Christmas Day 1998 we saw a boomerang north of Kansas City.;1998-12-25 13:30:00;5 minutes;On Christmas Day 1998 we saw a boomerang north of Kansas City. On Christmas Day, 1998, at approximately 1:30 in the afternoon, my husband and I were traveling between family homes to celebrate Christmas.  We were leaving Kansas City to go to the north.  (it occurred 15 miles south of KCI airport).  As I was the passenger, I looked to the north and saw, against a solidly cloudy sky, what looked like a large dark boomerang.  I cannot really determine the size, as it was not close to any terrestrial objects near the horizon.  It was totally by itself in the sky.  As we were south of the airport, I have often seen airplanes, so I did a doubletake, thinking that's not an airplane. I observed it for 2 or 3 minutes without telling my husband, and then told him.  In that time it moved very slowly to the northwest. Upon my telling my husband about this, he found a place to pull the car over and looked.  We rolled down the window and listened.  We heard nothing.  We watched it together for 2 or 3 minutes, and it gradually disappeared. I am a science teacher, with a masters in education.  My husband is a professional artist with a bachelors degree.  We are both amateur astronomers with the local astronomy club and have spent  much time beneath the night sky, neither ever observing anything that we could not explain.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Crescent shaped lights that emitted green light and then moved jerkily and then hovered in place;2012-11-06 19:50:00;>2 hours;Crescent shaped lights that emitted green light and then moved jerkily and then hovered in place I walked onto my deck at 19:50 and a flash caught my eye in the western sky. I live only 6 miles from the Kansas City airport so I am accustomed to seeing planes takeoff and land. I looked at it for a time and realized that it was making jerky movements preceded by a green flash. It was a light at high altitude, crescent shaped.   I watched it for half an hour and it moved repeatedly, then I sighted two more in the southwest sky. I also witnessed what appeared to be planes with red and white flashing strobes, and I assumed that it was military observation of the phenomenon.   Then I sighted two more in the southern sky.  After 22:00 the lights from a nearby shopping center were dimmer and I was able to see more right overhead and in the eastern sky.  I became unable to count accurately due to the number of UFOs in the skies. Until last night, November 6, 2012, election night, I have been a skeptic and now I am a believer. I phoned my sister in Syracuse, NY, who is professor emeritus SUNY, during this sighting, since she attends UFO conferences and is a staunch believer.   She questioned me and was sure that I was in fact witnessing an event.   They looked different from stars which appear as a bright light that twinkles sometimes and do not move in the manner of water bugs on surface tension on a body of water like these objects did.   I am not sure of the exact duration of the event, because the election coverage was on TV and I went inside to see who was elected. I ceased watching at 22:00 and went back out at 00:30 and they were no longer there. The constellations had changed position, but that was all I saw in the skies by that time.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Falling chevron UFO fire coming from the back above my school AL last Thursday. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2017-04-06 12:00:00;10-15 seconds;Falling chevron UFO fire coming from the back above my school AL last Thursday. I was playing tag at my school Academie Lafayette, when suddenly I heard screams and my friend said look up!  I looked up and saw the UFO.  It scared me too death.  It was falling, very fast.  It got closer and closer to the ground until it froze in mid air and I blinked.  When I opened my eyes it wasn't there.  This all happened within 15 seconds.   At its highest, it looked about the size of the sun.  Like it could block my view of it.  When it was falling it was massive.  I got pretty damn close to us.  I thought it was gonna squish us.  It was jet black.  I think it was on fire.  It smelled like burning plastic, and there was a gigantic trail of blue fire behind it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  Witness is a student.  We contacted the school, but an administrator there stated that she was not aware of any such sighting.  PD));39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Illuminated gold/yellow Chevron traveling from East horizon to West horizon in seconds.;2019-02-14 20:00:00;20 seconds;Illuminated gold/yellow Chevron traveling from East horizon to West horizon in seconds. Gold\yellow Chevron-shaped something was seen in the North East horizon, approximately at a 10 o'clock placement to the Earth if there Earth were at 6 and directly overhead was a 12.  It traveled from East to the West covering the entire horizon in a matter of 10 seconds.  It traveled faster than anything that humanly exist.  It was very big.  The size of the Moon on any given average night.  It was a Chevron-shaped, triangle with another triangle offset directly behind and the triangle behind tip of triangle splitting the middle of the one in front.  Never seen any thing like it and no question of it possibly belonging to this planet.  Absolutely not of this world.  Moved faster than any thing we have on this planet. Unbelievably fast.  One horizon to the other (East to West) in a matter of less than 10 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to contact the source of the report, in order to establish the correct date of the sighting.  PD));39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
