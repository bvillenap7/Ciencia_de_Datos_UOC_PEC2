I zoomed in on it and it was black and had the shape of a rocket with flames starting at the nose of the vessel and continued up both sides of the vehicle. We watched it for about 4 minutes until it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907

There is a large Bayer factory next to the highway, and in the distance, past the smoke stack, I could see the object in front of some clouds.  It looked like it was really far off in the distance, however it was very distinct, anyone looking could have seen it.  The airport is some distance away further north, so I am not ruling out it was an airplane.  But, it didn't look like it was moving.  After I changed lanes by about Front Street, I could not see it anymore.  Just seemed strange, I could not see any lights on it, the whole thing just seemed to reflect in the morning sun.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
Five fast.cigar shape images going in circles above our neighbor hood.;2012-06-30 00:00:00;over1 and a half hours;Five fast.cigar shape images going in circles above our neighbor hood. At about 10:30PM I went outside, the sky above me had five cigar shape images going in circles above our neighbor hood.  At first they were bright and then started to dim down and shot five different directions very fast.   Then they came back went together for about three seconds and broke in five again.  The trees blew like a forty-mile an hour wind and lighting shot across the sky one time.  They left for about ten minutes and three returned and started circling again but no wind this time everything was still.  The people across the street came out of their house and saw the same thing I saw. It was scary. It reminded me of close encounters somewhat the speed they had. I tried to take a picture with my phone each time the picture was black and all the other pictures in the phone but two. I then got my digital camera and took pictures and all the pictures were black.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
3 oddly lit planes that might explain some of the UFO sightings.;2012-08-01 23:00:00;12 minutes;3 oddly lit planes that might explain some of the UFO sightings. location is 100th and N. Woodland ,  kansas City Mo 64155   This is not a UFO but just 3 really odd aircraft that would totally confuse people.      There is a 747-8-International with spot light like lighting going down the  body.   This 747 is visible as a cigar shape  from about 50 miles away, and looks  brighter then venus if it is heading towards you.   paint color seems to be white.     There 2nd aircraft looks to be a 737 with same lighting as the 747 but about 60% dimmer.  You can see it as a cigar shape from about 15-20 miles and looks like a normal large aircraft coming in for a landing.   Plaint color is all black.       The 3rd aircraft looks to be a small business jet with all the same characteristics as the 737.      747 is the main one I have noticed and it is magnificent.  They have been flashing the lights in cloud formations and it can resemble lighting.  If its flying overhead, its brighter then the full moon.     All the planes are zigzag! ging the Kansas City area,  with lights on, sometimes off, sometimes pulsing the lights, and flying around 5,000-15,000 feet.;39.1017974363965;-94.5674646144907
