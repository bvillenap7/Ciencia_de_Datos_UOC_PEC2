UFO Sighting - Outside Farmington Missouri.;2007-10-22 06:30:00;2-5 minutes;UFO Sighting - Outside Farmington Missouri. My 9-year-old daughter and I were standing outside waiting for the bus.  We live in a very rural place with much farmland (right at 15 minutes outside of Farmington Missouri (south west)).  Our lot is 5 acres and we have dogs, cats, horses and cows on the surrounding farmland.   It was right at 6:30 am and it was still pretty dark here.  I saw what I thought to be a very bright star in the North East sky.  And it was not twinkling, however it seemed to get larger and larger.  It was very quiet here and we could not hear anything at all.   When I noticed for certain it was getting larger I just figured it was an airliner going southwest towards us.  My daughter and I just watched it for about 2 more minutes and when it started to get closer and closer, I could see how low it was and got scared.  My daughter and I then went under the nearest tree and I tried to hide her under me a bit.  The aircraft was in full view the entire time and it came right over us.  The light on the front was a very large bright white light, just one light in front that we could tell.  The light was too bright to be able to see the topside of the craft.   When it went right over us at about 100 feet, the horses and cows and dogs went crazy and started making loud sounds. The lights on the side were blue and there were 5-8 of these small blue lights on the left and right side (underneath).  The object was triangle in shape and never made a sound.   It did not seem to interfere with the trees at all, though it was right above the tree line (approximately 75-100 feet high).  There was no wind or anything else emitted from the object.  When it passed over it was going rather slow. It seemed to slow down a bit going over the farmland right across from the road.  I could not say how fast however my daughter and I were able to tell what the underneath looked like.   The color of the craft was mainly gray-scale and was not what you see in movies at all - meaning it was not all flat and perfect.  It had what looked like ridges and mechanical wiring, etc... It was not a shiny object.   After it passed I quickly moved to the right of the tree so I could see the backend of the object and it had red lights on the back end, though I could not say how many lights were on the craft - definitely more than 5 and they were small.   Then the craft just took off very fast on the same heading.  Soon after the animals got quiet and nothing else followed.   Of course I came inside as soon as possible and did not wait to see if there were any to follow, either. I will be honest and say that I did not believe before I saw this in the sky.  I did ask my daughter what she thought that was in the sky, and she said she did not know but thought it was strange because it did not make a sound and the animals did not like it.   I had her explain it to my husband and as she was explaining it, not one detail was different from what I experienced.   I looked up some military aircrafts online to see if perhaps it was on of them.  The closest I could find was the stealth bomber, however this was still quite a bit different from what we saw.  Differences between the stealth and the object we saw were the underside was different, the lights were not the same and no sound came from the object we saw.  They were very similar in shape, however the craft we saw was a perfect triangle from underneath. I would like you to catalog this, if you need to for your data and record collection a return call is not necessary but if you need more information feel free to contact me.  I wish to remain anonymous due to my profession.   Thank you.;37.7759000000003;-90.4070999999986

Triangular shape with rounded base, various colored blinking lights.  Then object begins to move slowly away in a northwestern direction while remaining low the entire time.  We have been unable to photograph the object.  These sightings have been ongoing for the past year, first at a great distance until the past three weeks.;37.7759000000003;-90.4070999999986

We have also witnessed a large ball of fire and a triangular shaped object traveling from northeast to southeast.  These objects have been observed by 15 to 20 neighbors and a newspaper reporter.;37.7759000000003;-90.4070999999986
