Explosion of white light / star type object;2018-05-12 20:45:00;30 seconds;Explosion of white light / star type object On the date of May 12th, 2018, at approximately 8:45pm in Farmington, Missouri, I was standing outside in my yard with my son and family using a star gazing phone app to find stars and planets.  At this time myself and 3 others noticed a huge flash of white lite light up the sky.  The flash was like an explosion of white light as though a star had exploded. That’s when a craft that looked like a small star shot off from the flash at a speed and height I have never seen an aircraft travel.  The speed was almost 100 times that of a normal passenger plane and the height in the sky it was at was almost in orbit.  If it wasn’t for the bright explosion of white light I would have mistaken the craft for a satellite.  The craft travelled north east at an astonishing speed and disappeared within seconds.  I spoke to my friend about this who is has an impressive air force and civil aircraft background and he could not think of any known aircraft capeable of such performance and! was very interested.  I’m not sure if this was an experimental craft or from another world but it was very impressive.;37.7759000000003;-90.4070999999986
