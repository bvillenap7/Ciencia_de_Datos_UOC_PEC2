Huge fireball type object with humanoid object in the center.;2012-11-08 19:45:00;2 minutes;Huge fireball type object with humanoid object in the center On the night of November 8th 2012 I was walking down a street in Farmington Missouri and I glanced up at the sky.  This is when i noticed that in the north west sky there was a bright object.  There was a building obstructing my view so I walked a little quicker to get around it and that is when I saw a huge fire ball type object sitting in sky silently maybe as low as 10 stories up.  It looked like a mini sun that was just hovering there.  The middle of the huge buring object however was black and I noticed it looked like something in the middle of it was moving. When I got a better look it realized that in the middle of this burning ball of light was what appeared to be the shape of a human  only larger than any man that I have ever seen. I noticed the figure appeared to raise it's arms up then the fire around it started to get bigger and bigger and then it went from a still position to moving slowly away. Then It moved diagonally up and imploded on it's self! after making an enormous flash of light.;37.7759000000003;-90.4070999999986
Observed 2 yellowish/golden fireballs.;2015-09-01 21:00:00;1 minute;Observed 2 yellowish/golden fireballs At approx. 9:00 p.m I observed a dazzling and golden colored fireball traveling from south to north. To me it somewhat resembled a yellowish/golden street light.  The object was traveling at about the distance of a low flying plane and at a slightly slower speed.  I watched it for approx. 45 seconds/ to 1 minute, until it faded from sight. Less than 5 minutes afterwards, I was gazing west and was surprised to see another fireball exactly like it and at about the same height.  Distance from me appeared to be less than half a mile. The fireball was traveling west to east, but I was only privileged to witness it for about 3 seconds.  It abruptly vanished as if it had never been and all that remained to be seen was a patch of empty black sky.  I waited for it to reappear.  Perhaps in another part of the sky, but it never did.;37.7759000000003;-90.4070999999986
