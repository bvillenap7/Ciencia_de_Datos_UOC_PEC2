The time was around 7:30 PM CDT. The sighting occured at the Farmington Airport, in Farmington MO.  This airport was investigated in 1974 by Dr. Harley Rutledge of Southeast Missouri University, when lights that were not aircraft, were seen by the local Stick and Rudder Club headed at the time by Mr. Ralph Pingle.   As I was coming off of Highway 67 on New Perrine St., I spotted what I thought was a bright landing light of a larger than usual aircraft for this airport.  As I approached the airport, I could see that whatever it was, it was not going to land.   The object headed from East to West.  As I watched it, the back end behind the light slowly started to extend out into a dark blue cylinder.   Not believing what I was seeing, I slowed down so I could see it better through the front window of my truck.  As I went past the Jaycee Park, I noticed a second object the same as and slightly below the first. I pulled over to the side of the road, to get out and look at the objects, when they both had vanished.;37.7759000000003;-90.4070999999986
