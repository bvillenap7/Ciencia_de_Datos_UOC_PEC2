My sighting happened nearly 9 years ago, but, is different than most.   It was a beautiful December night, a little crisp, practically clear skies, and very little moon light.   I had been talking on the phone and smoking a cigarette, staring off into the northern skies off the deck at the rear of my parents home.  I ended the conversation, and was finishing my cigarette, and I noticed that some of the stars would disappear for a moment, but then reappear.   I watched this for a couple of minutes, and realized it must be an aircraft or something, and also that it seemed to be headed in my direction.  Sure enough, it went directly over my parents house.   I was mesmerized by the size, which I would estimate around 10 blocks wide, and 3 blocks thick.  It was low enough that I could see indentations like giant portholes all around the bottom.  It was a rusty/greenish looking metal.   There was absolutely no sound.  And no lights.   Had I not been staring at the stars I was staring at, I would have never known it when it went over the house.  It just soared over the house at what I would estimate 50 to 60 miles per hour.   I ran in to get my parents, but of course, by the time they got outside, it was gone. That's my sighting.  And though nothing exciting happened, it is definitely an experience I'll never forget.
