UFOs use meteor shower to mask activity;2018-08-12 03:00:00;Observable until sunrise;UFOs use meteor shower to mask activity Approximately at 0300 my girlfriend and I stepped outside to watch the meteor shower that we had heard about.  When we noticed an orange cigar/triangular shaped object flying east.  When we continued to watch the object it suddenly stopped and then vanished right before our eyes.  I had never seen anything like it.  As we continued to look at the sky we saw more objects as well as a vertical line of flashing lights with an orange as well as a blue craft parallel to the line.  Other objects were suspected of being UFOs but we couldnâ€™t determine for sure on these.  Once we had seen the crafts I went and told my father who came out, and as he did another orange craft flew directly overhead once again heading east. By this time sunlight was beginning to over power the stars.  When sunrise hit no stars could be observable, only 3 crafts, 2 orange, 1 blue.   We continued to observe until sunlight overpowered the lights from the crafts and the sunlight masked the objects.  This is the first time I had ever seen anything like this.  I will continue to observe the night sky more intensely.;37.7759000000003;-90.4070999999986
