Large rod ufo moving toward St. Louis, Missouri, from Farmingtom, Missouri.;2016-02-27 21:45:00;1 minute;Large rod ufo moving toward St. Louis, Missouri, from Farmingtom, Missouri. My fiance and I observed a rather large object traveling from the south heading north toward St. Louis, Missouri.  This object looked like a rod UFO as seen in some rod UFO photos on the net.   There was no sound nor was there any lights or contrail.  The object was moving pretty quickly and the sighting lasted for a minute or less.   This object looked like a series of squares with a core but the square shapes changed as they waved like that of a centipede's legs.  I looked up possible photos of what we saw and I did find a photo that looks almost identical to our encounter.   I asked if anyone else had seen this on a social media sight and found that a lady and he grand daughter had observed it, too, while traveling North on Hwy. 67.   I find it strange that a sighting was reported in St. Louis approximately an hour later, which is sixty miles north of Farmington.    This was the strangest thing that I have ever seen.;37.7759000000003;-90.4070999999986
