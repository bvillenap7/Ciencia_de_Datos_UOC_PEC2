First object, seen at around noon, was hovering/moving slowly just above the treeline before it moved out of sight.  Accompanied by a low hum/buzzing sound, was darkly colored / all black, no visible markings or lights, and was circle shaped. The second object was within a week (before or after the sighting of the other), at around 11pm, and was high in the sky, barely visible with the naked eye.  It was one spherical object, being orbited by another smaller spherical object, green in color (changing to orange occasionally), and the smaller object was emitting a trail around the bigger object forming an '8', both were like a spherical fireball.  It was moving north east, and was gone in about 6 minutes.  There were 2 jets following it.  Was more visible with a telescope or binoculars. After these two instances, I experienced a close encounter.  I cannot recall much, however I woke up to an entity standing over me, and it looked like it was brighter than day outside, however it was around 3-4am.  After that I blacked out, and had missing time from 4am-10am, when I usually wake up at 6-7am.  This part could've been a dream, however I was never into UFO's or 'Aliens' until this point, nor knew anything about them.;36.7121;-93.1669
