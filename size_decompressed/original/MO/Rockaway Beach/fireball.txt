July 4, 2010 9:00pm at Rockaway Beach, Missouri, there were hundreds of people in the park looking up at the sky in preparation to watch fireworks.  It was a somewhat chilly night for July.   We were in the grass next to the lake and a playground.   7 of us in my family saw a bright orange fireball moving across the sky from the south to the north about 3-5000 feet above the ground.  There was a lighter foggy border around it but all you could really see was fire underneath the object, which was unseen due to the dark night sky.  It was about the size of Mars when it's closest to the Earth.   The object was seen for about 10-12 minutes and then went behind a cluster of trees and wasn't seen again.   We discussed a hot air balloon, an airplane and a blimp as answers, but none of them seemed to be the right fit for a description of the object we saw.;36.7121;-93.1669
