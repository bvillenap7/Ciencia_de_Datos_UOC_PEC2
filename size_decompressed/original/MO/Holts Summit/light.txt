Weeks later, its back again...;2013-12-08 19:30:00;30+ minutes;Weeks later, its back again... 2013 December 8  On 12-8-13, was two nights before I bought this iPad (to get online again after 6 years offline, I really felt it was necessary to file 3 years of ufo reports), I am coming home from looking at the iPad, about 7:30pm and coming up our driveway facing west, I noticed the same rounded white light off behind the trees I had seen 11-28-13, this time closer.  I estimate one mile away at most but, I think more like a half mile and a couple hundred feet altitude, doing it's dim-bright-dim-out-dim-bright routine again.  I know now, there are few houses back there, most are further north, south, or west of where this light hangs.  I watch for perhaps 5 minutes outside, come inside and continue to watch for another 10-15 minutes, watching off and on thereafter for sone time and finally give up, being starved, I go make dinner, thinking to myself, they're back...  I'm glad, they are becoming like old friends, and after 3 years seeing these things, or maybe the same one! , it was like they were there just saying hey, we're here, like an old friend that drives past and toots their horn driving down your road, just to say hi.
