Unusual large silver object seen at great height.;2011-07-30 21:00:00;10 minutes;Unusual large silver object seen at great height. 2011 July or August   Mid simmer, one late evening at dusk, my apologies, the date & time, not noted....   Different than previous encounters, there was a large silver aluminum colored craft at a great height.  If I had to guess it was at 30,000 feet at least, directly over Holts Summit MO., it did not move.  It was a cigar like craft with a raised portion on one end like a check mark shape and appeared to me to be a very large craft, to be so high up, and yet, so large, in the sky.  I watched it for approximately ten minutes with one of my neighbors, before I lost it in the setting sun and drifting thin clouds, it seems to have vanished during that time as I looked for some time after this but, it could not be found. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.6356;-92.1176
