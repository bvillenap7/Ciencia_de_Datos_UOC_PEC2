Its Baaaaaack !!!!  5th year same time same place.;2014-01-13 22:22:00;5 minutes (both);Its Baaaaaack !!!!  5th year same time same place Previously I reported that a UFO possible ETV has been overflying Holts Summit Missouri, and one of these reports was on the 14th of january on prior years, it returned...  Tonight, it overflew us again at 10:22pm 1-13-13 and again overflew us at its usual time 12:25am 1-14-14.  It was very high again a thousand feet maybe several thousand feet going east to west at 10pm and flew west to east after midnight.  The first pass I got one photograph, the second pass I got out there faster and got several pictures.  This has become an annual event and it apparently makes several passes about 1 hour apart, something I had thought previously that I had heard it, but was not sure.  It is interesting that today, I had forgotten the event, and fell asleep at 4pm or just after, I was exhausted and had a dream I was watching a ufo, fly over me....  Was this a message?  I believe contact is coming, they are definitely trying to tell me something, at least I certainly hope ! so, because this makes incident number 16 and 17 I believe since the near landing in 2010. There us also growing photographic evidence, the digital camera is great!  Tonight I snapped at least 11 more photos, now total of 15 perhaps more, and one video that may or may not show something.;38.6356;-92.1176
