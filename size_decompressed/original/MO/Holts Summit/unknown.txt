High Altitude UFO Pursuit;2000-09-03 22:00:00;45 seconds;High Altitude UFO Pursuit I know this report is of an old sighting.  Just learned of this website recently. 3 Sep 2000 State Road  AA, 3 miles outside Holts Summit, Callaway County, Missouri  Witness: self and friend/soon-to-be fiance   While on a visit to friend's residence, we had gone to the home of her closest friend. We returned after dark (after 9pm, exact time not remembered).  We were standing outside of my vehicle observing the night sky. Out of the south, we observed a dot of light moving at high speed.  Suddenly, the object made a 90 degree right hand turn and continued due east, seemingly without loss of velocity or momentum. Following this object were 2 other objects (at this time, presumed to be USAF fighter interceptors on afterburner).  These secondary objects appeared to be in pursuit of the original object sighted.  The secondary objects appeared to be unable to match the flight path/pattern of the first object, instead, turning east in a wide, arcing manner in order to keep up. Event lasted approximately 45 seconds until all objects were out of view. All were at high altitude and did not produce noticeable sound.;38.6356;-92.1176
