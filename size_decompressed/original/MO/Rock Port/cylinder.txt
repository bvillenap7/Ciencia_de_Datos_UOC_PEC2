Large green glow no falling star;2008-07-27 23:40:00;3 seconds;Large green glow no falling star Driving south Rock Port on outer road next I-29 exit, my daughters boyfriend & I saw what we thought was a falling star.  My daughter wasn’t looking in the same direction, so she didn’t see it.  It appeared in the south east suddenly and was only visible for about 3-5 seconds.  He said its green, I said yeah that was weird, like radio active glowing green, red along each side, but not top & bottom & it was not very high up, was very large, more oblong/up & down, not round.  Falling star, meteor, space junk, UFO?;40.4307;-95.5261
