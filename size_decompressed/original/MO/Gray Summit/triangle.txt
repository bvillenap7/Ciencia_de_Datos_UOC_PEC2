triangler craft spotted near gray summit, Missouri.;2006-08-25 20:47:00;5 mins;triangler craft spotted near gray summit, Missouri. It was appoximately about 8:48. on a Thursday night.  My Husband and I were traveling westerly on I-44.  Near Gray Summit, Missouri.   I was admiring the sunset when I spotted a very bright white light up in the sky. It was NorthWest of my vehicle at the time, and looked to be like the north star except it was moving very slow, and about cloud level in the sky.  I thought it was strange looking, but assumed that it was either an airplane or a helicopter.  I tried pointing it out to my husband, but he dosen't believe in UFO's and proceded in giving me the middle finger.  Anyway.  About the time our vehicle reached the object it had decscend from high up in the sky to more above tree top level.  I watched it intentley and as it passed overhead to the upper right of my truck I was able to look at it. Instead of seeing a helicopter or airplane, it was black triangle with lights on all three sides..white, red, blue were the colors.  The weirdest part was after the UFO passed I turned and looked out the window as much as I could and I saw another smaller white ball of light near the UFO.  I don't know if it fired or if it was another craft because a split second after I spotted the bright light it vanished completey.  It was a very cool site to behold.  I am sorry I don't remember the date, but It was about two weeks ago on a thursday.  I do remember the time as 8:50 when I looked at the radio clock after I lost site of it.;38.5019;-90.8324
