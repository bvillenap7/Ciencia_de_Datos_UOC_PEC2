Large red circular  light in sky.;2006-03-06 20:30:00;intermittent;Large red circular  light in sky. I was driving home from the store and in the southern sky saw an unusually large, red object. It appeared very bright, but would dim intermittently--like a very large twinkling star. I lost sight of it due to the hills and trees, but when I was almost home, it (or another) appeared again, this time in the eastern sky.;37.137;-92.12
Orange/whitish lights in eastern-norther Missouri skies.;2007-03-01 18:30:00;3-5 minutes;Orange/whitish lights in eastern-norther Missouri skies. While outside with my granddaughters we saw a strange orange/white light ascend into the eastern sky and remain there for about 10-30 seconds.  It was bright at first but slowly began to fade until it was gone.  About 1 minute later the same or another object was seen to rise to the same approximate height and repeat the same sequence only further to the north from the first sighting.  Again about 1 minute after fading from view the object again reappeared at the same approximate height and repeated only now at or near due north.;37.137;-92.12
Bright silvery circular object moving slowly northeast.;2019-09-28 19:00:00;5 minutes;Bright silvery circular object moving slowly northeast. In the north sky, heading Northeast it was bright and silvery. A little bigger than what an airplane would be. When looked at through binoculars it looked like a circle.  It traveled pretty slowly.;37.137;-92.12
