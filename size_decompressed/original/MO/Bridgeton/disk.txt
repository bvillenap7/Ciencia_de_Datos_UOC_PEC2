Silver/Blue Disk Rotating end over end East to West at least 20,000';2009-04-06 13:15:00;5 min;Silver/Blue Disk Rotating end over end East to West at least 20,000' I was outside at work looking up at the deep blue sky, after several days of rain, I spotted a silver flash traveling East to West similar to an aircraft, but there was a blue flash between the silver flashes like a disk flipping over and over blue on one side and silver on the other. The object was at about 20,000', There was a commercial aircraft a little higher with a contrail traveling From South East to North West. This object just passed over my 90 Degree and just stopped horizontal motion still flipping ,then it darted back a few degree's east then shot straight up higher and higher till it was out of sight. That was the last i saw of it. The sighting lasted about 5 minutes.;38.748;-90.4215999999998
