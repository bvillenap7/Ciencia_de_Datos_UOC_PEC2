green circular light in the sky that was going around and around in circles;2010-11-26 21:26:00;a while;My son went outside to take the dog out.  There was a green circular light in the sky that was going around and around in circles.  I have seen lights in the sky for promotional use during Halloween, but usually you can see the beam of light go from the ground into the sky.  All we could see was the circular shaped light with no beam as it went in circles.  This could very well be an advertisement since it is Black Friday or maybe someones Christmas decoration, but we just thought it was weird and wondered what it was.
