Dark rectangular object ascended into the sky near St. Louis International airport;2010-10-12 20:15:00;2 minutes;dark rectangular object ascended into the sky near St. Louis International airport On 10/12/2010, I saw a large dark colored rectangular object while in the parking lot of Quick Trip in Bridgeton, MO.  This is near the St. Louis International Airport. I was just about to leave when I noticed a man entering QT, who seemed fixed on the sky as he walked toward the entrance.  Out of curiosity, I looked up and saw this dark rectangular object moving west very slowly.  The object appeared to be moving at the distance one would expect a helicopter to fly.  I got in my car then rolled down the window in order to hear if it made any noise which it did not.  As I watched the object, it appeared to stop then it got smaller and smaller as if it were a helium balloon disappearing into the atmosphere. I watched it for a minute or more, until I could no longer see it.   As I was about to leave, the man I saw earlier exited the store.  I asked him if he saw that and he said, Did you see that?  I said, Yes, did you see that? again, and he then asked, Did it fly over the store while I was inside? I told him how it ascended into the sky until I could no longer see it.   I was still in awe of what I witnessed and just drove away.  I felt relief that someone else confirmed seeing it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
