UFO while on I-55 @ Mile Marker 17.;2016-10-11 23:10:00;30 seconds;UFO while on I-55 @ Mile Marker 17. While driving north on I-55 through Missouri, I saw a UFO.  Around mile marker 17 near Hatti, MO, I saw a fast moving object coming towards me at a low altitude.  At first I thought it was a fighter jet but it was moving so fast and made no sound. As it got closer, I saw it was saucer shaped, but flat and squared off on the bottom.  The entire front bottom edge was lit up a bright blue on the side coming towards me.  If it was a fighter jet the bright glow should've been on the back side.  It couldn't have been more then 500-1,000 feet above the ground.   I've never seen anything like it and I've been around a lot of military jets.;36.2286;-89.7416
