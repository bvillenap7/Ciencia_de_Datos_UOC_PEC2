A friend was following me from Kennett,MO to Hayti,MO in a car after we had visited our girlfriends in Kennett. Saw a flying triangle. I saw a craft that looked like two headlights in the sky. I pulled over to the side of the road, as I had seen this thing before from a distance. Joe pulled over behind me, since we were in separate vehicles. We got out of our cars and asked what's the matter Markie, and I responded with That Joey as I pointed at the craft that was approaching. He looked up and said, well, I'll be godamned as we just watched it float by, with no sound other than a woosh of air.  I was almost in a hover, moving at no more than 5 miles per hour.  It just putted past us on the othe side of the two lane road, just past and above the telephone poles. It was triangular with rounded corners, and had green lights on the front, red in back, and white in the center. It also had a very slight dome on the top. The are that I saw this was within 35 miles of a nuclear bomber base, and I had seen it many times before and after.  I can't help but think that it is of US origin.  Otherwise they would have had fighters in the air to defend against a UFO. I realize that this is an old sighting, but it was certainly a good one.;36.2286;-89.7416
