Bright light that diminished traveling from south to north over Fordland, MO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible orbiting body?  PD));2012-04-18 20:55:00;30 Secs;Bright light that diminished traveling from south to north over Fordland, MO I was sitting on my deck and watching the stars and seen a bright light appear that looked like a typical falling star.   This falling star however didn't burn up, it flashed like the sun had reflected off of it and then continued traveling from the south to the north as I was looking to the east.  It wasn't low enough to be an aircraft and had no sound.  It eventually disappeared off in to the night sky to the north. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible orbiting body?  PD));37.1486;-92.9111
