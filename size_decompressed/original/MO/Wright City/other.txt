The lights were stationary and stretched from the horizon to well above a 45 degree angle in the sky.  There appeared to be a faint string connecting the lights, maybe 30 of them in a line that was crooked at intervals, as though they were being towed by a plane (probably moving south as they appeared stationary).   No it wasn’t fireworks. They stayed lit and then with I circled back within several miles they were gone.  I don’t believe it was an alien UFO.  Candidly while I believe in the possibility, I don’t believe in the probablity, but am curious if any one else saw it and know what it is.  My parents were with me and they saw the same.
