It looked to be about 1-2 acres in size if it was on the ground.   It was very hard to see it as it had no lights which I thought was very strange not that seeing a ufo isn’t strange in the first place.   I have heard of numerous reports of people seeing a ufo but never heard of one in which someone saw one that had no lights.  It looked to be gray and blend in with the dark sky.  The best part of it that I could see was the edges which were a little lighter than the rest but it was a solid triangle.   It sort of scared me but at the same time amazed me.  I didn’t feel it posed any threat to me while I was witnessing it.   It went directly above my house and kept going down to the Missouri River.  It looked to be heading to the east.   The entire time I saw it it never slowed or stopped.;38.5683400000001;-92.2209015999997

The lead craft was ahead of the the other five.  The rest followed equal distance from each other and stayed on the same tangent to the west.   Speed seemed faster than private plane.;38.5683400000001;-92.2209015999997
