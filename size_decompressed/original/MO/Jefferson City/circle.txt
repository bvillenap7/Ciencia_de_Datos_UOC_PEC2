Perfectly circle lit up underneath;2012-11-06 19:17:00;5-10 seconds;Perfectly circle lit up underneath I saw a UFO on Tuesday, November 6, 2012 at 7:16 pm on hwy 50 south of town at the Militia Dr exit. My daughter and I were driving home from COMO and saw red blinking lights in the sky, My daughter was the first to ask what it was and asked if there was a tower there.  I was thinking the same thing but I told her no and we slowed down to look as we passed by and looking out my side window I saw plane as day a UFO still in the sky.  Not much higher in the sky than above the tree line. It was perfectly round, the bottom side was lit up with a light like a soft white fluorescent and it had lights around the outside of that in white and red color.  I could just see the shape of it on top because there were no lights on top and it was rounded.;38.5683400000001;-92.2209015999997
