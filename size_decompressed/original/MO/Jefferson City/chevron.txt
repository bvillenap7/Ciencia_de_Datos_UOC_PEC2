Chevron shaped light with comet tail.;2015-03-29 22:30:00;5 minutes;Chevron shaped light with comet tail. Last night i took my dog out to the back yard and noticed a star that was getting brighter and larger in size then shrinking again and seemed to be turning green.  I assumed this to be clouds moving in front of it but it looked interesting so i continued to watch it.  It began to take on a chevron shaped glow and repeatedly became extremely bright.  My husband and i are skeptics to a fault so i assumed and still do this may be atmospheric phenomena so i ran in to grab my camera to see if it would record something different than what my eye was seeing which brought my husband out for a moment and then he went back inside.  I tried to record it but couldn't get a good shot, i couldn't get close enough. I continued to watch it, standing still in the same spot, the rest of the sky was clear. I stood for about 2 more minutes when a red, what looked like a comet tail or exhaust tail appearead from the top of the star. There were what resembled a star dust pattern clos! est to the star, it became more solid towards the end. From my perspective it measured maybe 4 inches in length from the main light.  I ran inside and told dan to come out so i would have a witness. He saw the changes in size and light but nothing else. He thinks i hallucinated the rest. I watched for about 5 or so more minutes, the light diminished to where it was almost gone and stayed that way so i went inside. Im 33 years old, he's 30 i've never reported anything like this but i was curious to see if maybe someone else had seen it so i thought i should say something.;38.5683400000001;-92.2209015999997
