Star like object spotted in the clear dark heartland skys;2004-08-11 05:30:00;60-90 seconds;Star like object spotted in the clear dark heartland skys I was watching North/North East for the August meteor shower,super clear black skys, when I noticed what looked to be a star moving across the sky. It was moving rather slowly but at a steady pace, traveling from the southeast to the northwest and then slowly faded from site. Total siting lasted around 60-90 seconds. It even twinkled like a star. I hope I was not the only one to see it.;38.5683400000001;-92.2209015999997
Bright light.  Very quiet.  Moved at two different speeds.;2012-04-09 21:15:00;30-40 seconds;Bright light.  Very quiet.  Moved at two different speeds. Was a slow moving, then fast pace bright light that was quiet.  Absolutely no sound from the craft.  I seen it for approx 30-40 sec.  Was around the same elevation or lower than airplanes.  The thing is , when it was pasted my house it lifted and vanished.   Never seen anything like it.  Was so weird there wasn't any sound. I'm just puzzled and wanted to write down or tell someone what I have seen.  I have seen stuff that I thought was an UFO but never got to this point of reporting it.   I'm clueless on this one.

A straight line of many multiple lights directly overhead.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 21:20:00;5-7mins;A straight line of many multiple lights directly overhead It is now 9:50 PM 4/27/2020.  About 30 minutes ago a friend and I were outside and I looked up seeing a straight line of independent lights traveling about from northwest to southeast.  Estimate up to 100 in the line – hard to say they kept coming and coming appearing from northwest and disappearing in a southeasterly direction.  This looked like an invasion force – a line of lights all aligned – very strange;38.5683400000001;-92.2209015999997
