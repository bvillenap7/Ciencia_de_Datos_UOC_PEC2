Turquoise light turns crimson red.;2016-03-07 19:05:00;5 minutes;Turquoise light turns crimson red. Bright turquoise colored object west of Jefferson City.  Ran inside to get camera.   Object appeared to be getting closer and was under the low cloud ceiling.  Object then headed to the south.    Object changed from the turquoise color to a crimson red as it passed- it flickered between the colors once.    Took video, until I could no longer see it.    Iâ€™m at a lower elevation- this should have continued to be visible over Missouri. (I can provide Vimeo link to video if you need it );38.5683400000001;-92.2209015999997
Translucent orb observed for one hour just East of Jefferson City.;2020-07-11 20:15:00;1 hour;Translucent orb observed for one hour just East of Jefferson City. Observed thru spotting scope and telescope.  At the 9 to 12 O'clock area there were 6-8 red circles at the outer edge.   Clear inside but seemed to show different images inside, such as clock hands at 10:10 and one time looked like a comet inside.  Have photos of this.   It slowly dimmed and drifted away and at this time cell phone picture showed several discs flying by it.  (there's a chance they could be birds, but very unusual).;38.5683400000001;-92.2209015999997
