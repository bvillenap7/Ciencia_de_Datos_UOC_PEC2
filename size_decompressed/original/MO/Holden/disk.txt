I was six years old, at my grandparents house, playing hide and seek with my cousins.  We were in the back yard, fenced in area were my grandparents had kept their animals horses, donkey etc.    I decided to be sneaky and leave the pasture out the fenced area.  I ran along side the fence towards the woods behind the barn.  The next thing I know, I'm looking out a window above my grandparents house.  I was looking down at my cousins playing, and my  grandparents roof,  it seemed that I was about a little higher then my grandpas highest tree.  It happened so fast I really didn't have time to think about what was going on I turned around.  And I seen a little boy sitting crosslegged with his hands on his face elbows on his legs looking like he was crying when he looked up at me.   Around this little boy was small, Gray, creatures and around them was tricycles, balls, just some kids toys.  Immediately to the left of the boy was three gray bigger creatures the one in the middle was smaller than the two beside that one.  I began in my head  saying out loud that I want to go down there back down where I was.  The next thing I know I'm running the opposite direction towards my grandparents house.  I turned around and looked up and there was nothing there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.7218;-93.9854
