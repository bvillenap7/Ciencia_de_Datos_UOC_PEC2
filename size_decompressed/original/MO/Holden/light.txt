5 red-orange Lights fading in and out from right to left horizontally;2011-08-15 22:20:00;20 seconds;5 red-orange Lights fading in and out from right to left horizontally Standing outside my garage walking out, I saw, to the east/southeast a sequence of 5 orange-ish red lights.  These lights were horizontal but slightly higher on the left.  The lights appeared from right to left, fading in one at a time, then quickly faded out in the same fashion(also right to left). after the first time this happened, I yelled at my father to come look, he saw one of the 3 occurrences of the same thing happen. each time this occurred subsequently, the lights moved to the left(north).  After the third time, I stared in the area for about a half an hour, before giving up on seeing anything else.   When I had my sister bring my phone from inside the house out to me, the camera app would only show blue(which it has never done, and had worked prior the same evening);38.7218;-93.9854
