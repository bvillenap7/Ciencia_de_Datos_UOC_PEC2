2 bright lights side by side seen near Freeman, MO.;2004-03-25 01:00:00;30 Seconds;2 bright lights side by side seen near Freeman, MO. On my way back home to Garden City, I was leaving Freeman from my brotherâ€™s house at 1:00a.m. sometime in late March or early April. I was heading west towards Harrisonville on 2 HWY approximately 5 miles past those huge oil tank objects. My cousin was riding passenger when he pointed out two large, white lights, considerably low to the ground, with nothing flashing or blinking on them. The light coming from these was steady and very bright. There weren't any beams of light, and the sky between the UFO's and the tree line could be seen, with nothing above or beneath them. I slowed down and my cousin rolled his window down, and we heard no sound coming from these objects. I told my cousin to grab my digital camera from the glove box, and as he turned around to film what we were seeing, the objects in the sky were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
