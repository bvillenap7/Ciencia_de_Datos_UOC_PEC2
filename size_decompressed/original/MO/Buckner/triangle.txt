In the month of December, 1985 as I drove from downtown Kansas City to my home in Lexington, Missouri, I saw, on several occasions a triagle shaped object in the sky.  It had red and green blinking red lights and seemed to stand still on all but one of the occasions.  On that one occasion, it came closer, hovered for awhile and took off at a right angle.  It seemed to go straight up at this right angle, but very fast.  It seemed to be close enough that I would have heard a sound but there was no sound.  I have been telling people about it ever since it happened but have never filed a report, telling myself there must be a logical explanation.  Nevertheless, I saw what I saw and decided that I should report it.  Maybe someone else also saw it and my report will help to corraborate what others saw.;39.1264;-94.2073
