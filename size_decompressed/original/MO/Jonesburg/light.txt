Half way home, (around Warrenton) we spotted a strange white light in the sky directly over the highway. As we drove closer, we could see the bottom of the light. It had four triangles on the bottom. The craft then started to move slowly to the west after we passed. 2 miles further, we seen all kinds of activity in the sky. A strange small, red ball bounced up and down and went up the highway about 100' in the air. This, I was told, was an electronic eye My wife and I were driving up highway I-70 on our way back from St.Louis about 12:05 PM on Dec. 8th 1996. Around Warrenton, or Jonesburg, Mo, we spotted a very bright white light above the highway. Just hoovering above an overpass about 1000'. As we drove under it, I could make out 4 little triangles on the bottom. The object started to move after we passed. Latter on down the road, we seen a red (electronic eye as I call it) bobbing up and down going up the highway.   That about sums up that story. My family has seen NUMBERS of ufo's since 1950. My mother seen a disk in the middle of an intersection in Tx in 1950. She was almost blinded by the light. I've seen so many, I don't have time to write it all down. I've seen crop circles in our field, I've seen ufo's more than once. No one can tell me that rocket boosters bob up and down and form formations in the sky! Hope this matches up with someone else's story. Thanks for listening.;38.8754;-91.302
