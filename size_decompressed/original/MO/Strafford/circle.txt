I had spent the weekend w/ my father & step mom when they were getting ready to take me to my moms in Springfield (10 miles away).  We walked out to the truck after dark & obout 1 mile away in the sky was a light formation that was just hovering.  I was studying the solar system in class so I was always interested in the sky & stars.  As we drove closer, the formation still hovering became more apparant that it wasnt a regular aircraft.  My dad thought it was a helicopter but once we were directly under the formation we stopped the truck & turned off the engine.  This is in the middle of the country so no sounds of cars or trucks could be heard.  We listened....dead silence.  Then the formation took off at a very smooth yet fast pace & flew up & away in the sky.  It then was gone. I have thought of this experience every since.  I truly beleive what I saw was a UFO.  I have had no other experiences yet, but I do look forward to the next time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.2791;-93.1039
