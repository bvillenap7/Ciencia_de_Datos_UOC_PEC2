A couple of friends and I stopped on a rural bridge to look at the stars on 08/21/2004 at ab out 11:30 PM.  As we were looking at the sky we noticed a blinking star, as we watching this star we noticed that it was waving back and forth. After watching the craft dash in and out and side to side and up and down we called my brother and his wife to look at the object to make sure we were not seeing anything that wasn't there, after 10 minutes of watching they both concluded that it had to be an ufo for the way that it was moving.  While still watching it, about 1 hour into it we noticed that all of the little stars around it were blinking sparatically as if back and forth to eachother.  Keeping our eyes on the whole scene of the sky we noticed that these little stars were also moving and jolting slightly, and they would come and go as if just disappearing.  The objects seemed to be communicating with eachother by blinking lights that seemed to be either red or white or both sometimes, they would all come and go and they all did move around the sky.  We watched the objects for approximately 3 hours and at some points only 2 would be within eyesight and at other times up to 20 could be seen moving.  I have always been a sceptic until that night, in all 8 people saw everything that I have told you and everyone would tell you the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at a celestial body, possibly Sirius, in the northeastern sky.  PD));37.6364;-93.0885
