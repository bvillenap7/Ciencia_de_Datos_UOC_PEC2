Unusual aircraft;2011-10-06 17:13:00;30 seconds;Unusual aircraft This doesn't fit a typical UFO report.   At 5:13 pm 5 miles south of Buffalo, MO,  I was outside with my gps and heard a very loud noise that made me think a military jet was passing within site of my location.  After stepping into a location where I could see a larger section of sky, I finally located a sillhouette of what would appear to be a passenger 747 at standard crusing altitude for commercial traffice in the area.  This had no visible contrail and compared to a typical passenger jet appeared to be flying at around 3 times a normal jet.   Based on the altitude the jet could be heard as well, very loud as well as clearly which was unusual in this area, much less at that volume. Based on my normal views of airplanes this should not have been heard, again it was the sound that caught my attention to begin with thinking a military jet was approaching as I had seen f-14's in the area a few days prior.   My cell phone has a compass on it and after tracking the object for approximately 10 seconds by sight it dissapeared much quicker than any 747 at that altitude I had ever observed.  I had aproximately 20 seconds of hearing something approach and 10 seconds of visual on the jet.  Using my compass, it was headed at aproximately 225 degrees sw of my location. I know this doesn't fit into a typical report, but the whole scene did not fit the general feel of a typical 747 commercial jet , altitude, sound and speed of what you would normally think. If it can be determined this was a normal commercial flight, at least maybe weather patterns and temperature etc would help identify other things that you get reported.;37.6364;-93.0885
