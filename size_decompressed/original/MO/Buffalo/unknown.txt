Red Glowing Ball;2010-05-18 21:30:00;5-10 seconds;Headed north on 65 about 9 miles south of Buffalo.  Conditions were cloudy. A large red glowing ball appeared though cloud cover and seemed to pulse for between 5-10 seconds, then went out.  Object did not move left or right and was not a radio station tower, as I live nearby and know the locations of those. I stopped my vehicle and got out to view object if it reappeared so I could photograph it as I had a digital slr with zoom lense with me.  No futher sighting occured after 5 minutes.;37.6364;-93.0885
