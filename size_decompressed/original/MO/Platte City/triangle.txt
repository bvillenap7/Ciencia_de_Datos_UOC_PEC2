Triangle shape object observed, no sound or lights.;2012-11-12 04:58:00;8 minutes;Triangle shape object observed, no sound or lights Okay so I obviously have never thought I would be making this kind of report.  I live approx 3 mi NW of Kansas City International Airport and was woke up (4:50) by our dog to go out as usual. As I am standing there I saw something out of the left corner of my viewing area. I thought it was a very thin cloud floating or maybe remnants of a contrail.  I did a double take and sure enough I could clearly see its shape... It was a wing like shape similar to the B2 but had a metallic skin.  I observed the slowly moving object for about 8 minutes heading on a North Westerly heading then it went due North with no change in speed unitl I lost sight.  This object wasn't the typical fire, lights or aliens in my window sighting that you see on TV. Instead this had no lights or sound but was completely illuminated by the lights from the airport and the bright stars - clear as day! I then ran inside to inform my girlfriend of what I saw and made a drawing of the object. I am not a licensed pilot but have been flying for over 20 years and never finished my exam and have extensive knowledge of any aircraft both military and commercial. I wish to remain anonymous but felt like I should make this report... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.3618;-94.7903999999999
