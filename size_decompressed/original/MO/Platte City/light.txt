Two extremely low green fire-balls with-in 26 hours, electrical interference.;2013-08-26 01:30:00;5 seconds;Two extremely low green &quotfire-balls&quot with-in 26 hours, electrical interference. It was approximately 01:30 on 26/08/13 and I was sitting outside on the balcony of my top floor apartment talking to my husband on the phone.  A strange green fire-ball flew across the sky almost directly in my line of vision.  It was as if it had come from almost directly behind the apartment and made an arch in the sky like it would have if it had been thrown.  I thought maybe it was some kind of natural phenomena except it looked like it was maybe 80ft high from the ground.  There was no sound to it at all and it had a green glow as big as a street light but circular in shape. Just over 24 hours later at 2:14 on 27/08/13 I'm leaving my apartment to drive to my husbands work, when I see the exact same thing in the distance, except this time it left an orange trail and it came out of the sky at a 80 degree angle.  Both times it disappeared just before going behind the buildings.  The second fire-ball appeared around 80-100ft, before that I didn't see it. After seeing the second one I called my husband right away to tell him and there was some kind of electrical interference that we both heard and it was very loud.  I had earache for almost an hour after and my husband claims his hearing went in the one ear for a few seconds before returning.;39.3618;-94.7903999999999
