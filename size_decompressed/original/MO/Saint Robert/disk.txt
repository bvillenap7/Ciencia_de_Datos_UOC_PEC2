This object was huge in size.  Although it was a distance away, it must have been the size of a football field or bigger.  I have never in my life seen anything like it.  It flew north of St. Robert, and so low that I'm 100 % positive that others also seen this object.  Still shaking and can't wait to see if others are reporting this.   Now I'm definitely a believer that we are not the only ones in this universe.;37.8286;-92.1309
