I had noticed the trash was not taken up to our trash compartment so I grabbed it and headed up the hill East, looking out to our pasture I noticed that everything became a brilliant hue followed by a shadow of light this is the only way I know to explain it even the night time noise that your normally hear at night fell silent.  So much so it startled me and I looked up I saw three lights which really didn't alarm me but it grew brighter in the distance and so I thought oh cool a shooting star then it shot straight up in the air all three of them and turned kind of a golden brown then went back to a bright light again I stood gazing up at it thinking what the heck is this, then it just stopped right in the air and then shot straight across to the left  I did not have a camera on me except my cell phone that I had in my pocket so I grabbed it out and turned the camera part on and snapped the pictures.  This thing shot across the sky stopped again then literally went straight up and at an angel and then it was gone.  I have it on my phone still but it freaked me out so bad I was not going to tell anyone about this because they would think I am crazy as all get out but I have not been able to get that out of my mind the washing of light across the field like that and taking off straight up in the air stopping in thin air like that and turning was kind of freaky.  Even Tom's cows after a few seconds of that deafining silence started going nuts.   I never believed in them before but I really want to know what the heck that was it sure would make me feel better and sleep a little better at night,  any realistic thoughts?;39.7316;-94.2427
