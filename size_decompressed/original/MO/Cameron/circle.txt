Highly Reflective Object Vanishing in Clear Sky;2012-08-18 06:52:00;1 minute;Highly Reflective Object Vanishing in Clear Sky 4 miles south of lake arrowhead in Missouri UFO sighting at 6:52 am.  Clear baby blue sky saw a flying object. Initially I thought it was an airplane it was very shiny I remember because that is what captured my attention.   It was so reflective and silver that it looked like the airplane had it's lights on.  The shape was of the object unclear because of the distance  Upon watching the object maneuver it became obvious that it was not an airplane. It seemed to have the capability to move up and down not just forward.  My friend, who was driving at the time also noticed the object and asked me what is that? All of a sudden the aircraft vanished as if someone threw a sheet over it to hide it. It did not fade off into the distance as an airplane would.  This disappearance happened within a matter of 3 seconds into the clear blue sky. ;39.7316;-94.2427
