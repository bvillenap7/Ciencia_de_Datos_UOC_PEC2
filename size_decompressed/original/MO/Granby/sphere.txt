We lingered behind to talk and smoke a ciggarette. As we made our way across the lawn toward the back porch...I noticed a faint glow on top of the trees....kinda like a full moon cast it's glow on trees....only this was alot dimmer than that....just barely noticeable. I looked up and toward my left...towards the east. There was what at first appeared to be a star...but it was brighter than I have ever seen an inner solar system plannet get...and it was growing in brightness and size. In about 2 or 3 seconds it was almost half as large as full moon would appear and much brighter! It seemed to pulsate at a low visual frequency and had blackish blotches or stripes by the outer edges. Then suddenly it went 130 degrees backwards and to the south and upward.....  as it dimmed greatly and shrunk at the same time. Now it looked only like a far away satalite moving much to fast at an awkward angle. It then transformed into a bluish white haze or mist and vanished without a trace.  There was no sound from the sky at all durring this 4 - 7 second U.F.O. sighting. We were both amazed...and talked a bit about it. We hurried up to the back porch and jacuzzi where amazingly both my wife and the other couple had seen what we had from a different angle. Needless to say we had an interesting disscusion for quite a while!!;36.9047;-94.2659
