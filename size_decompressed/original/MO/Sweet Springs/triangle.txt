I was riding with my dad from kansas city to columbia, mo.  We were on I-70 traveling east when I looked out my window, looking south.  I saw a triangular shaped aircraft, and when I asked my dad what it was he said a B2 bomber.   We were close to Whiteman Airforce Base so it seemed logical.  I was sceptical though because it wasn't moving.  It hovered over a farm field and barely moved.  It looked like it was facing north but never advanced toward us.  I didn't notice any lights because it was 6 p.m.  When I first saw it, it was tipped so I could see the top of it, then it tipped back so I could see the bottom.  It was a perfect triangle and completely silver.  It wasn't very high off the groud and directly off the highway.  I didn't hear any sounds from it.  I stared at it for about 15 seconds or so because we were traveling at around 70 miles per hour and didn't stop.   I'm from st.charles county, missouri.  I'm a freshman in college.  My dad is an electrical engineer.;38.9691;-93.4259
