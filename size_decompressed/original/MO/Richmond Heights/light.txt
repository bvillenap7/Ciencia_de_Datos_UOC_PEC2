I looked up at an airplane flying overhead and closer to the horizon, a light caught my eye. The light was in the western sky, moving southward in a straight and slightly downward trajectory, much faster than the airplane above.    It was silver and apparently very bright, for it stood out well against the orange and red sunset.  The light was also apparently below the clouds, since as it passed by them, it was not covered up.   As it moved, the light faded transparent, not dimmed, and disappeared.  There was no sound.
