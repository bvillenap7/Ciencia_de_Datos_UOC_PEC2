UFO over Pleasant Hill;1988-04-12 16:00:00;5 min;UFO over Pleasant Hill The date of occurance is approximate as this is not my sighting but a friend of the families sighting. The man was mowing is yard in the early evening hours and as he did he noticed the sky turning  colors as if a storm was moving in. He looked up and over at the field by his house and saw a flyin saucer, he ran into the house and told his wife and I believe he had a child or two. He grabbed a camera and was able to get to pictures of it, as he took the camera way from his eyes the object zoomed away. I have a copy of one of those pictures.;38.7859;-94.244
