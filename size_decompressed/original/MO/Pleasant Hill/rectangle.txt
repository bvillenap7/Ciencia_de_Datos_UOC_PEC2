Rectangular object, fades away into space.;2018-12-21 21:50:00;2-3 minutes;Rectangular object, fades away into space. On the evening of December 21st, my 7 year old son and I witnessed a glowing rectangular object 12 o'clock of the Moon, which then drifted to the 6 o'clock position of the Moon, when it passed over the Moon it was lost in the light and then reappeared.  The object moved downwards of the moon, enough that I held 2 fingers in front of my face, and could fit them between the Moon and the object.  Up to this point I would have disregarded it as a reflection of some sort, however, the rectangular object then was stationary for a few moments, a glowing rectangle, approximately half the width of the Moon, my son and I watched as it slowly faded, as if it had flown into space.  Some additional details I would include, are that I noticed several planes in the sky, and this was well above passenger jet altitude, also that it was not clearly defined, it was almost like a plane flying through clouds, when they have their lights on, except that there were no clouds around the object.;38.7859;-94.244
