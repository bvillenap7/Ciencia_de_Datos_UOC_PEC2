Multiple orange lights/orbs in sky.;2010-07-04 20:00:00;15 minutes;Multiple orange lights/orbs in sky. Our family was outside lighting and observing fireworks.  When I spotted a strange orange light moving from south to north, it was not an airplane as it was not blinking.   At first we all thought it was a new type of firework, but then another appeared a few to five minutes later.  We then filmed it and took pictures of it when a third appeared.   Approximately 5 minutes later (we then timed it expecting another) another did appear.  We waited for another but none came. I didn't think much of it until this morning when I spoke with my daughter (who lives in Festus) and she said she saw the same thing but only one of them.  This prompted me to find this reporting center and make a report.   We called a local news channel but they advised us to call the police, we did not because frankly we didn't want to look foolish reporting lights in the sky on July 4th.;38.4997999999999;-90.4650000000001
Flashing white light hovering and circling.;2010-08-18 03:00:00;1 Hour;Flashing white light hovering and circling. Tonight is the second night I have witnessed this light.  It is bright like a star, but it flashes like lightning. Mainly it is a white light, but when it moves I have also seen blue.  It flashes like it is taking pictures.  It is not a plane because it movesfrom side to side with such great speed that it leaves streaks of bright light behind. I cannot tell what shape it is because it is too far away.  The lights are illuminating it, but they are so bright.  Whatever it is is staying in the same location for at least an hour for two days in  a row.

I was sitting in the rear of the car when I happen to notice to round light orange colored lights just hovering, or moving extremely slow. we also saw airplanes and condense stripes coming from the airplanes.  The orbs were hovering approximately hundred to hundred fifty feet off the ground.   The aircraft were at much higher altitudes.the most recognizable feature was the color of the orb a little lighter then the orange color of a gas flame.one one was bigger than the other and they were at different altitudes.   traveling further on turning on to highway100 towards fenton I lost the orbs  behind some trees.traveling back home westward bound on 44 another occupant noticed one orb towards the direction of the old chrysler plant.ialso seen it after rolling the tinted window down.;38.4997999999999;-90.4650000000001
Bright light shoots eastward over Fenton at 1000mph and disappears.;2016-02-06 19:15:00;5 seconds;Bright light shoots eastward over Fenton at 1000mph and disappears.  2/6/16  We were driving east, when we saw a bright light with a flashing green light fly over us also heading east.   My first thought based on speed and altitude was a single engine airplane or a helicopter. But soon as we saw it and I had time to think that, the light shot eastward and disappeared in less than a second.   Couldn't have been a shooting star based on altitude and it was overcast.   Not sure what we saw but it definitely wasn't natural. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.4997999999999;-90.4650000000001
