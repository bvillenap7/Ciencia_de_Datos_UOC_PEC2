Yellow-Orange flickering conical shaped light over St. Louis;2012-03-24 20:00:00;2 minutes;Yellow-Orange flickering conical shaped light over St. Louis My wife and I were in the car traveling South on highway 141 in Fenton when I noticed a bright yellow orange colored light in the Eastern sky several miles away.  At first it looked moved like a police helicopter, but the odd thing about it, it flickered like a flame.  My wife noted the light had a conical shape with the top of the cone pointing upward and the light faded at the tip of the cone.   I told my wife it looked like something was on fire and it might be a meteor or a piece of space junk.  We pulled over and kept watching it.  It was headed slowly in a NE direction.  As we watched it, it made a turn and started heading in a due South direction.  We got back on 141 since we were close to home and I wanted to get my binoculars to get a better look.  Unfortunately, as I drove into my driveway I noticed it was getting much smaller and had changed directions again and was heading back in the NE direction.   Within a second or two, the light had gotten s! o faint I could barely see it then it appeared to gain altitude and was gone.  I watched for a few more minutes but never saw it again.;38.4997999999999;-90.4650000000001
