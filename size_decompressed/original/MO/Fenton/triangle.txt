Black triangle with single light over Fenton, MO (Murphy area).  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible celestial body.  PD));2005-10-28 20:00:00;20 minutes;Black triangle with single light over Fenton, MO (Murphy area). I was about to shut the blinds in one of the upstairs bedrooms when I noticed a rather large white light in the sky.  Knowing that stars twinkle, and the light of a planet stays steady, I assumed this must be a planet.  I grabbed my binoculars.  As I was fixing on the object I noticed that this light was kind of bobbing back and forth, and up and down in small increments.  I'm thinking that atmospheric conditions are the cause of this apparent movement of this hanging light.  While looking through the binoculars it was impossible to keep the light steady in view, but I noticed a black triangular shape which was darker than the night sky that enveloped the orangish-white light. This thing just continued to slowly bob and zig back and forth and up and down in very small increments while at the same time slowly moving to my right until it moved out of view disappearing behind the rooftop of my neighbor's house.  The period of time from first notice until it was out of my sight was approximately 20 minutes.  The next night (tonight-10/29/05) I went to shut the blinds in the guest bedroom as usual and this light was exactly where it was the night before--appearing and behaving exactly as before on the previous night.  I will be looking tomorrow for another appearance. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the light may be a celestial body, given that it has been seen on sequential nights.  We do not know what the black triangle was.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.  PD));38.4997999999999;-90.4650000000001
Huge Craft spotted over Gravois Bluffs in Fenton Missour July 4th 2014.;2014-07-04 22:38:00;5 minutes;Huge Craft spotted over Gravois Bluffs in Fenton, Missouri, July 4th, 2014. Wife and I were at a Fireworks viewing at our friends house, and during the neighbor display as we watched my wife and friends wife noticed some light strung out along the horizon.  There were planes flying in the area and were obviouis that they were planes with proper lighting. I heard them mention the lights but paid no attention as I was watching the firework display. My wife said is that an airplane what is it.  So about 22:30 we left the gathering and headed home.  When we got to the intersection of HWY 30 and Summit Rd in Fenton, my wife said there it is again.  She was driving and I rolled down the window and hung out looking directly up in the sky.  There were light high clouds and this object was above those clouds I would say 10,000 feet maybe a maximum of 15,000 feet.  It was huge according to the light patterns.  There were 7 lights in a long row, with 2 lights centered just opposite the long row of lights.  I would guess this craft was at least 6 or 7 football fields long maybe more.   At first I thought why would there be 9 helicopters grouped like that flying in constant formation.  Shortly after that I realized it was one large object moving slowing above the clouds.  I told my wife Holy Crap that is a giant UFO!  It is moving in sync.    My wife tried to take a picture of it but the street lights were blinding out the camera when she held it up.  Just about that time all 7 lights switched off and then there was only two lights and then one of those switched off.  At this time traffic lights had changed and we had to go because of traffic.   The more I thought about it the more I suspected we had just seen a huge craft of some sort.  The craft made no noise all I heard was the car engine running.   Now fast forward to July 10th.  On the news channel here in St. Louis they ran a piece showing the lights in the sky and a guy talking about them.  He had gotten them on a video loop and sure enough it was the same configuration of lights stretched out on the horizon.  This craft is huge and it has been seen several times over the St. Louis Metropolitan area.   If you look into reports filed at local TV stations you may be able to get the video.  That video has on it exactly what we say above us July 4th.;38.4997999999999;-90.4650000000001
