I was driving home. It was a warm summer night and I was going east on the River Road between Hwy. 44 and Highway 30, a stretch of about 2 miles. The road follows the Meramec River the whole way. I was about half way between Hwy 44 and Hwy 30 and I saw a reflecton of colored lights in the river. I stuck my head out of the window and looked up to see what was causing the reflection. I saw some sort of craft about maybe 100 feet up. It had 8 to 10 different colored lights that were blinking in order. There were two rowes of these lights, one row on each side of the craft. It was hovering directly above the river. At first I thought it was a helecopter but it didn't make any noise at all that I could hear and a helecopter would cause ripples in the water, and there were none. It was a fairly large craft but it was hard to judge just how high it really was, so that made it hard to judge the size. I didn,t stop to look at it further because there wasn't any place! to pull over, so I only saw it for maybe 30 seconds. I passed a couple of cars going the other way so they might have seen it also. I am not sure what it was, but I have never seen anything like it before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
