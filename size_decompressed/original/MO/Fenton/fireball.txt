bright flickering red lights orbitting around Fenton MO caught on camer and video;2010-09-14 22:00:00;1 hour or more;bright flickering red lights orbitting around Fenton MO caught on camer and video Me and almost all of my neighbors saw these flickering reddish orange lights floating in the sky. We thought they were just flying by us until another nighbor pulled into the parking lot and informed us they were orbitting around us in a circle. If one would fall behind the one in front of it it would speed up until it was back at the same distance behind the other as the rest. They were intelligent and the best way to describe them is like airballoons with the fire flicking inside the balloon, or like orbitting sky lanterns. Red and flickering like candle light and one of the  most amazing things we had ever seen. The entire neighborhood was outside starring up at the sky for a good hour or more. The police were called by one neighbor and we were told it was embers from firework show that had ended, . . . two hours prior! I pointed out, embers would be floating through the air  like feathers, these were orbitting until the last cycle when instead of going a! round the circular path they had been traveling for a whole hour before they just kept floating off to the east until the last one faded.

Fireball object without sound.;2016-01-01 00:38:00;3 minutes;Fireball Object Without Sound At about 12:38am in Fenton, Missouri, I saw a orange globe shaped light floating in the sky.  Figuring it was a helicopter I thought nothing of it until I noticed no audible sound coming from the object.  No later than a minute after another appeared from the same direction with a slow pace gliding through the sky.;38.4997999999999;-90.4650000000001
