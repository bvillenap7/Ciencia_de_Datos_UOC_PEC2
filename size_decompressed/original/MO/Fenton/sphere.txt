Looked up saw three orange spheres heading toward St. Louis (but could see outer edges of round triangle shaped unlit wings). Three crafts continued, one disappered.  Outside McDonalds other couple watching. I asked them, What are they?  Couple said we don't know.  Guy said look and coming over McDonalds in Fenton about eight orange bottom spheres flying over McDonalds roof heading toward St. Louis.  In large round formation.   Left McDonalds they were gone.;38.4997999999999;-90.4650000000001
