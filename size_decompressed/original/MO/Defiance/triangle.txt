As I was washing my hands at the kitchen sink , I looked out the window , then I saw a 2 lights coming over a ridge that some of our New neighbours had told us about see balls of light . We heard this a lot . You how small towns can be . I wanted to believe in UFO , but I just never seen any . As I was watching these 2 lights turn in to 3 . I started yelling for my wife , I really was pretty excited , she came running downstairs . Just in time to tell me its a airplane. But wait a minute ..... She has been working around plane at Boeing for a long long time . And this is No Airplane she has ever seen !!!  If you live in The Hwy 94 area ( Defiance ) and you have seen this slow .... Very slow moving UFO . PLEASE POST YOUR REPORT . I want to call the News people , but I think most people I am crazy anyway . I know what is a Airplane is , I think I know what a UFO Looks like Now !  I will draw up a photo , and I will ask the wife to do the same , but hold your breath . She would be fired right way .
