Strange lights over Defiance;2011-09-17 23:00:00;2 MINUTES;Strange lights over Defiance We were heading to steak n shake and saw a girl in the road.  I beeped my horn, she said turn your lights off so you wont scare them away.  I said what?   Then i looked up where she was, and saw several lights in a pattern.  IM so happy my husband ans my sister inlaw was with me.  I always believed in them.  They are so narrow minded and now they are believers too.   But, were they doing?   And how did the girl know that the lights would scare them away?;38.6616;-90.8302

About 10 minutes ago, 6:15pm central time, I took my two dogs out to the front yard to go to the bathroom.  As I'm waiting, 2 cars stop in the middle of the road in front of my  house and both drivers get out of their car.  One dog did not have a leash and ran towards the people standing in the road. As I tried to corral my little Maltese, my neighbors frantically told me to look! look! Over there!!.  I turn to look what they are pointing at and there in the sky 182 degrees to the south of my house was 10 to 15 reddish/orange circular lights staggered vertically.  There was no sound, and it was obvious these were not from an airplane of any sort.  As we watched, slowly every light dispersed into the darkness over a minute and a half to two minutes.  There is not a single cloud in the sky tonight and what is most strange to me is the fact that they simply disappeared into thin air. They didnt dissapear behind trees, or clouds or simply because they were too far a! way but just.. vanished.  I've had the chills since I've been outside and they don't stop, this was truely a phenomenon and certainly something I've never witnessed in my lifetime.;38.6616;-90.8302
