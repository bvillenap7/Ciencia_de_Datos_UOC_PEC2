Big Bright ovals being fired into night sky faster than Jet;2007-12-29 19:18:00;30 seconds;Big Bright ovals being fired into night sky faster than Jet I was driving south bound on US 63, my location at the time was one mile from the town of Ashland, Missouri. Time 19:18 hrs   At a distance of around 100 miles due south I saw 8 star white oval shaped objects of fairly good size, about 3 to 4 times the size of the brightest or biggest star in the sky, it looked as though they were being shot into the sky at around a 45 deg angle into the sky one right after another. They were very fast, faster than a missile or jet plane, there were about 8 of them. It reminded me of what missiles look like when they are fired off from the ground. They fired off from the ground one right after another, there was no fire trail or explosion, they shot up fast and then disappeared it only took a second for them to reach a great distance in the sky and then just vanish. What is it? I donâ€™t know, but I have never seen anything like it before. There is a military base Fort Leonard Wood in this direction at about the distance I saw them in. Maybe they came from there. The whole thing only lasted seconds.;38.7917;-92.2543
