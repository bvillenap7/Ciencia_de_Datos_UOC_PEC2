What appeared to be a stealth bomber allowed stars to shine through.;2002-10-30 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;What appeared to be a stealth bomber allowed stars to shine through. My wife and I were sitting on our porch smoking when this enormous shape passed overhead. It occupied perhaps a 45 degree section of the sky giving the impression is not far above the tree tops. It's shape was very similar to the steal bomber, and living not terribly far from Whiteman airforce base I assumed that it was. Even the fact that we could hear no sound from it did not dissuade me from that thought. It wasn't until it passed between us and a bright star that I was in doubt. The star could be seen through the object. It moved very slowly across the sky and I had the opportunity to see it pass across several stars which showed through the body of the object.
