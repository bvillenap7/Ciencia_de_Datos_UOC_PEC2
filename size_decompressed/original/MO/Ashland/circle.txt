At this point we were probably no more than 7 or 8 miles away from it.  The object did not appear to move the entire distance we were watching it. As we got closer to the object it appeared to have several white lights and not just one anymore, which were extremely bright.  When we came right up beside it or what would be parallel to it, the object seemed to be hovering over a field and had what looked like a faint light protruding off one side of the object that resembled a spot light.  As we passed the object we turned to view it from our back window a bright red light flashed on the top of the object and one on the bottom, then after a minute or so the lights began to flash all around the bottom of the craft, which made it appear to be spinning.  We continued to watch when all the sudden the craft quickly crossed the highway to what would be the passengers side of the vehicle, and caught up with us instantly.  After a couple minutes the craft disappeared behind the trees no longer in our sight, after doing so there was a glow of light beyond the area it disappeared.Thats what we saw!;38.7917;-92.2543
