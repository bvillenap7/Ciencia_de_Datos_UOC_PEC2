I exited my home from the back door that faces South. I looked up and noticed a bright light that I thought was a star until it moved to the left then stopped also then it appeared to rotate clockwise. After staying in this position for a bit it appeared to grow smaller (as if moving directly away from us) but it did not change position in relation to the stationary object that we were comparing it to. The object then emitted a light (like light diffusing through a cloud) for a brief second (my husband also witnessed all this). The object also disappeared completely 4 times only to reappear visibly smaller. Also the whole time the object was blinking with a steady light both white and blue.;36.574;-94.377
