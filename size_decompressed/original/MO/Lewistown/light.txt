Slow movement to west, then east, then high velocity NNW. What I saw was in the morning (06:01) shortly before dawn.  I looked out the window to see if the neighbour had left for work yet and saw what I thought was a plane.  I looked closer because it was different somehow.  I looked closer and it was a single light source, soft, big, and constant, kind of hazy not like the small, sharp, blinking lights of a plane known to the public.  It was moving across the sky parallel to the neighbours house.  I just went smoothly west.  The light was bright but not blinding.  It was about ten times the size of the larger stars in the sky.  It took about 3/4 of a second to go from one colout to another.  It shifted or slid from side to the other.  It did not have a deffinate line between the colours but it was more blended.  It passed behind the tree but was still visible due to thin leaves and sparse branches.  It continued for a minute or so and stopped dead, non-moving, then began to retrace its path, exactly.  It stayed in one place for about half a second.  The light never changed its pattern from left to right, or the colour.  About 1/3 of the distance I saw it travel, it became a tapered streak of light, coloured by all of the aforesaid colours.  It was gone and the streak accross the sky dissappeared with it.  I have perfect 20/20 vision and could not have mistaken it.  The sky was as clear as it could have been, no clowns or smoke.  I believed in this contact with other people and other sightings before but became fully aware afterwards.;40.0827;-91.8212
