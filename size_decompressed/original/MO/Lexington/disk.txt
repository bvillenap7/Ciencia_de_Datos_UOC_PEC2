disc over corn field;2007-08-13 04:30:00;10 min;disc over corn field At 430 a.m. I went outside of the house and noticed a disc shaped obeject about 100 yards or so over the cornfield. I ran back inside and grabbed my camera and took twelve photo's. I got two that were pretty good. This thing made no noise at all. When it left it was so fast that it cant be described! I also got a picture of a stelth plane in the distance that seemed to be chasing it. The pink glow you see was only in two frames. I do not know what caused that. It was right next to me and scared me real bad. I was looking to the east of the house.These photo's were taken on a sony cyber-shot 3.2 mega pixels camera. The air felt like it was full of electricity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));39.1764;-93.8671
