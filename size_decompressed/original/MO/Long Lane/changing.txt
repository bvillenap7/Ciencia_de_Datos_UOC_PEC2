More odd lights in Long Lane, no feasible explanation.;2014-11-10 19:30:00;2 hours;More odd lights in Long Lane, no feasible explanation. My family and I were watching the skies (this is an update of our other report on this site BTW) and we saw five new craft high in the sky, all of which moved and, as with the older ones, changed shape and color over time.  In addition, we witnessed three white orbs flying flying parallel to each other in perfect unison as well as pulsing.  They made several passes without any noise before simply vanishing half way through the final pass.;37.5815;-92.9359
