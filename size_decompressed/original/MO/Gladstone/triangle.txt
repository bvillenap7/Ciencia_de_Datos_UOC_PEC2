Aprx 1/2 mile past Englewood. A bright white light to the left of my sight above the neighborhood, caught my attention. I figured it was an air plane at first but after getting a clear look noticed that the light was quite wide and extremely white like an led but huge, and also very low and moving at maybe 2-3 mph but did have a red and blue light on each corner shoulder?.  I pulled over to see if I could get a better look at it.   At which time it rotated its position to its right and I could see its form better and it kinda tilted downward pointing its light angled at the houses appearing to scan or scout the neighborhood.  It was triangular in shape kinda difficult to explain.  The best was I can explain it, tho it may sound rediculous, is it looked transformerish no wings or propellers at all. It was completely silent.  Maybe a govt machine or something idk it was prob 15ft wide by 20ft tall.  80ft off the! ground.  Never seen anything like it befote.  Wondering if anyone else seen this or similar...;39.1995;-94.5265
