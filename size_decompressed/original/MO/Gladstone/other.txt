Then it seemed like it noticed that I was watching it, and it fliped like it was flying at an angle, and was moving very fast twords my car. When it turned to its side it had green and almost white lights, but they weren't flashing, or blinking, like some people describe it. The best way that I can describe it is that the lights were almost dancing in the air, they just flowed. I pulled over to the side of the road to make sure that this was what I was really seeing, It flew so fast. I started to panic, because it was just myself and my three year old daughter in the middle of the night, and sped up to get to the nearest public place. The craft followed me all the way to Quick Trip, where I was going to get out of my car to look at it better, but when I got out it was gone. This was the neatest and scariest thing that I have ever seen in my entire life.;39.1995;-94.5265
