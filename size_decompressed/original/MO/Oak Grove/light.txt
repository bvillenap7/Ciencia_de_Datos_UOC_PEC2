The light was moving at medium speed and at a lower level than other planes that fly over her house.  Her house is not near any airports so it was unusual to see a light this low in the sky.  As the light drew nearer we did not hear any engine sounds nor did we see any other lights (like the blinking navigation lights on planes). As the light passed over our heads we still could not hear any engine noise or see any outline of a plane.  As the light moved away it didnot dim as you would expect if the lights were on the front of a plane that is now heading away from you.  I live in Omaha,NE and have seen a lot of planes with their landing lights on comming in for a landing at Epply Airfield and you can always hear the engine and see the plane as it passes over you .  The sky was clear with no wind so we should have been able to hear it and see the body if this had been a plane.;39.0033;-94.1411
