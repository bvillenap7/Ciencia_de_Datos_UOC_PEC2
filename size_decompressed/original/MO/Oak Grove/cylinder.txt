Bright orangish red spherical object moving from SE to NW of Oak Grove, MO.;2015-07-15 22:00:00;30-60 seconds;Bright orangish red spherical object moving from SE to NW of Oak Grove, Mo. On July 15, 2015, my son and I saw a spherical looking object traveling from south east to north west direction.  The object looked like a shooting star at first coming down then it changed color to orangish red in color and did a erratic bounching movement.  I caught it on my tablet before it went out of sight, heading towards Grain Valley, Missouri, and disappeared from sight.;39.0033;-94.1411
