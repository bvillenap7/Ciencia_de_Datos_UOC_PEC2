Floating blinking red and yellowish orange lights in Southeast Missouri near Hwy 412;2012-01-12 23:20:00;20-30 seconds;Floating blinking red and yellowish orange lights in Southeast Missouri near Hwy 412 I was driving home from a friends house. When I notice on a overpass about a half mile ahead, a round almost oval yellowish orange light the size of a beach ball.  With two smaller blinking red lights on both sides of the yellowish orange light.  At first glance I thought it was a 18 wheeler because how high the red lights were from the road.  But after staring at the lights for 20 or 30 seconds I notice a black shadow above the orange light. The sky was a dark gray-purple which made it possible for me to see the black shadow.  Under the black shadow and yellowish orange light I could the glow of street lights on the other side of the overpass.  That's when I realized it was not on the road, it was above the road and could not have been an 18 wheeler.  Then the lights shifted to the left behind a tree line and out of my sight.  When I got to the overpass there was no lights or shadow to be found.                ;36.1756;-89.6733
