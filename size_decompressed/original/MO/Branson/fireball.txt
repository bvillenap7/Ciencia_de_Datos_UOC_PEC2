Object see over Branson, Missouri;2001-07-14 22:20:00;10 sec;Object see over Branson, Missouri I was on vacation in Bramson, Missouri on July 14, 2001 sitting outside at about 10:20 PM. I was noticing how cool the big dipper looked through the trees. As I did I noticed a object come along and faded out. I feel it was fireball. But I am from New Mexico and I have seen alot of fireballs. I just never seen a fireball fade out so fast. The color of the object was yellow and red. Oh it also didn't have a tall like a fireball should have.;36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
fireball over missouri seen july 4th, 2010;2010-07-04 21:00:00;5 min;fireball over missouri seen july 4th, 2010 on the evening of july 4th, 2010 just prior to the local fireworks display, i observed a red-orange object in the skys directly overhead of my location in southwest missiouri,  approximately 3miles from where the fireworks display was to take place.  when first observed i thought the object had a somewhat wedge shape and was a very bright reddish orange color, moving from a south to north direction at a very high rate of speed.  i immediately determined that the object was in fact not conventional aircraft because there were no flashing beacons as are commonly seen on aircraft in US airspace.  i was able to capture an image of the object as i had my camera with me in anticipation of the fireworks display which began approximately 10-15 minutes after the sighting.  when viewed thru the camera perhaps because of the aperature it appeared as a simple round object.  i could only guess the object was perhaps 10 or 20 times the size of a jet liner and as it sped t! o the north it at one point disappeared into the overhead cloud cover briefly.  it moved at a much higher rate of speed than any conventional aircraft and i would guess it took approximately 5 minutes to travel from a direction due south of me until it disappeared from view in the north.;36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
