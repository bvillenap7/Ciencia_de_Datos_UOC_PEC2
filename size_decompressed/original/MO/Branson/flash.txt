Tho;2016-04-08 04:30:00;2 minutes;Early morning, trip to Eureka Springs Arkansas.  County road no traffic.  Flash of light followed by second flash shortly thereafter.  Thought maybe it was a car as the ambient light changed.  Not a car.  Not lightning and no rain or storms.  Reporting for possible corroboration with anyone in the area that noticed anything unusual. Coincidentally the trip took longer than expected and my first guess is navigational error.   The map I was using did not indicate a left turn for route continuance.  Signs indicated otherwise.  Was on 248.  These flashes were unusual enough to give me pause for thought;36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
