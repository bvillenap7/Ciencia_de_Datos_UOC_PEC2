We saw a bright star next to the sun as we were out for a drive.;2010-04-10 18:00:00;about 3-5 minutes;We saw a bright star next to the sun as we were out for a drive. My fianc√© and I were out for a drive around Table Rock Lake, when we both looked out the windshield and saw what looked like a VERY bright star.  This was strange, because it was only about 6:00 in the evening and the sun was still high in the sky. As we watched it, it seemed to be reflecting the sunlight like something big and metal.  When we went around a curve, the star started to dim as if the angle had changed and it was reflecting less light.  It was high in the sky like an airplane, but it was perfectly stationary.  Eventually, it dimmed to the point that it seemed to disappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
saw bright light ascending;2011-08-29 22:05:00;10seconds;saw bright light ascending I was at work. I usually take a smoke break at about 10. I, in fact, looked at the clock before I went out.  My job runs on keeping track of times, so I know it was 10. I usually like to go the the roof of our building so I can stargaze and the roof offers the least amount of street lights. I was looking in the direction of the big dipper when I saw a large orange light (orb?) floating upwards.I thought for sure it was a star, then I kept watching and it slowly started floating up. I could tell because a star to the left of it was a reference point I used. It was floating very slowly-if I didn't have that star to the left I wouldn't have thought it was anything but a star.  There were some clouds in the area and it seemed to go into a cloud. -or vanished.  I stuck around and lit another smoke to see if I would see anything else-or to see it pop back out of the cloud-I could see the top of the cloud. It never came back out of the cloud. It was a solid light, no flickering or pulsing. I got very excited during the sighting, I was hoping to watch more.  I gave myself another 10 minutes to look but never saw anything in the area. I did go back out to the roof about an hour later to see if I was just looking at a star, but the clouds had moved and there was no stars like what I'd seen.;36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
Saw light move left to right, and descending;2011-11-24 18:00:00;10 minutes;Saw light move left to right, and descending My neighbor, my brother, and I all were outside my apartment having a smoke and walking the dogs. We looked west/southwest and saw a bright, hovering light.   At first, I thought it was Jupiter or a possible helicopter, but I found Jupiter.  I had the other two look at the light, just to see if they could figure it out-that's when we thought UFO.  I ran and grabbed my camera and got a couple minutes of it.  I could see pulsating and the colors went from red to green to amber.  We watched it until it dropped behind the building next door. It moved slowly left to right and descended.  I looked at it with my Yukon Ranger night scope and it appeared to be just an orb of light that pulsated.;36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
Stepped outside on balcony on golf course, saw white light in sky blinking and hovering.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2016-10-04 04:00:00;5 minutes;Stepped outside on balcony on golf course to smoke, after being awoken by baby saw white light in sky blinking and hovering low above golf course. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect object may have been a twinkling star.  PD));36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
As I stood on my balcony, I saw approximately 40 bright lights evenly spaced moving ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-12-22 18:30:00;45 minutes;As I stood on my balcony, I saw approximately 40 bright lights evenly spaced moving in single file from SW to NE across SW Missouri. At 18:30 I was out on my balcony and was looking up in the night sky at the stars. I spotted a bright light going across from SW to NE. I then saw another and another and another they were evenly spaced apart and traveling at the same rate of speed. I stood there watching and noticed that they were coming from the SW. I stayed counting them I got up to 15 and thought this is no way planes or helicopters for they all had just a single bright light. I couldn't get a good video or picture due to the darkness and they wouldn't show-up. I then ran and got my Son to come and see them not knowing if they would be there once I returned with my Son as a witness. We got back out on the balcony and they were still there just as before. One after another and up to 40 of them I also noticed planes flying around the same area with their blinking white and red lights and I could till the planes were at a lower altitude then all the single white bright lights were that were! going across the night sky.  After the single file white bright lights stopped I stayed watching the same areas to see if anymore came as the first set. And, if anymore sightings of planes in the same area. I then witnessed 8 more of the same single bright light going in the same direction as the multiple ones. However, I could tell these were higher up then the other ones and further apart then as they got just passed my backyard tree line I saw a bright flash of a few of them then they were gone. I went back inside and went to see if anything was posted online from any other sources. This was at 17:15 and I found your site and decided to post this. A feedback to my sighting would be appreciated if another reports should come in.  Thank you,;36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
