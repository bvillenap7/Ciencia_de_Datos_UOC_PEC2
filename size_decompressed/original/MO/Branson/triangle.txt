It was a black triangle with no sound heading from the south to the north real fast.;2014-04-16 22:40:00;4-5 seconds;It was a black triangle with no sound heading from the south to the north real fast. I work at night and was going to take a break.  I walked outside on balcony and noticed that that the moon was bright and it was clear.  It was about 22:40.   I saw a dang chemtrail floating by in front of the moon.  Then I saw an object fly in front of this chem trail.  It was triangle with no lights, no sound, black or hazy gray.  It had a trail that was black or darker than the lighted sky.   I was an aircraft mechanic for 20 years.  10 of that was fighter aircraft in the air force.  I had never seen anything like that.  It went from south to north.  It came and went so fast I didn't have time to say wow before it was gone.;36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
