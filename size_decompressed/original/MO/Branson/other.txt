Looking north from the waters edge in blue eye mo just past the 86 bridge, starting from inside a home, unusual lights out the window caught my eye, so I fixed upon them for a while sort of flickering between a white and red, not unlike an aircraft, but the object was not moving  in the horizon accept every once in a while it would shift just a bit towards the east. This drew me and my wife outside, where we saw another similar set of flickering lights only this set was moving in a manner consistent with an aircraft, but lower and the lights where not as they should be on a commercial aircraft. Switching attention to this one I watched it fly from north to southwest and as it passed overhead slightly to the east the glow of its lights allowed me to see a main body of the object which was a light color maybe white or light grey? And sort of foot ball or eggish shaped without any wings that I could observe. The fact that I could see a fucilage clearly but coul! d not here the object is what made me consider this an unidentified object, as I am very familiar  with aircraft, and the sounds associated with them. The object continued out of sight towards the south and slightly west. Meanwhile the original lights that drew me out continued a slow and inconstant trec towards the east, moving slowly at times and not at all at times, I watched it for about 12 minutes before going in to see if others had seen anything and mentioned anything on the Internet.;36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
