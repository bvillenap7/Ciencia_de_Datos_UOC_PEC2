((Starlink satellites));2020-03-06 05:10:00;2 minutes;I took my dogs out early morning and looked to the north, I seen lights moving in a line heading east. They got to a spot directly north and vanished one by one, like if they where landing in something. I seen around 12 to 15 of them in a line formation. It's like when planes come in to land on a carrier.;36.6692426470589;-93.2448529411764
