Green fire ball with orange sparkles trailing behind;1998-12-08 23:02:00;2 sec.;Green fire ball with orange sparkles trailing behind 1. Green fire ball with orange sparkles trailing behind. 2. It went down at 35deg. angle from the north by north east. It did not make a turn. It came down in a line. I then lost sight of it. 4. It was the size of your thumb nail at arm length. 5. I was in my car moving south on State road Y, 5 mi. south of Belton, MO. The fire ball came into my view out of my windshield off to the south east. I did not see it hit the ground. 6. It reminded me of 4th of July fireworks display only in reverse, coming down not going up. 7. I have seen Russian space junk reentering  and burning up as it made a low pass over head over Kansas City. But this was not the same. The Russian space junk was in orbit moving south to north and was a blue/green and some white/ yellow with some orange. The green fire ball I seen tonight was more green not blue green like cooper when it burns.;38.8121000000001;-94.534
