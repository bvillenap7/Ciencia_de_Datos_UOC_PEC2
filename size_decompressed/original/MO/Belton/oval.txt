Three bright lights in the front and sides and a red light at the bottom on the object.;1999-11-23 18:10:00;5-6 minutes;Three bright lights in the front and sides and a red light at the bottom on the object. Object low in sky.  At first thought it was an airplane flying extremely low or about to crash and as I got closer it was stationary and made no sound.  There were three large lights that were very bright and larger than any light I had ever seen in the sky on an object and on the underneath side of the object was a red light that did not blink and the object looked oval in nature.  It was about 200-300 feet above the tree lines over a field.  I turned the corner to get a closer look and it was gone.  Nowhere to be seen.;38.8121000000001;-94.534
