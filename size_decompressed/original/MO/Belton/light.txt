Orange Light Seen Over Belton Neighborhood;2011-12-11 20:01:00;2 minutes;Orange Light Seen Over Belton Neighborhood I went outside to check some food I was cooking on my grill at exactly 8:00pm.  I noticed that it was much brighter than earlier because the moon was visible in the NE sky (the cloud cover had mostly cleared).  As I was looking northward to see how much the cloud cover had cleared, I noticed a bright orangish light become visible over/between some houses to the NNW of mine.  The light was intensely orange, but not like a flare or roman candle, roughly roundish in shape, and initially was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length (roughly a quarter-inch in diameter).  It initially attracted my attention because it was much brighter than the usual planes and helicopters that fly overhead, and because of the odd color which was unlike the usual air traffic. The light appeared to arc upwards and towards me before moving parallel eastward above two houses across the street, then gained altitude and disappeared to the north.  It was visible for approximately two minutes, moving at a slow, steady pace.  As the light moved eastward, it became more yellow-orange in color (though orange was still the primary color) and seemed to strobe slightly or perhaps flicker like flame. When I first saw the light, I watched it for 20-30 seconds before backing up on my deck to the door and yelling for my wife to come see it too.   She arrived promptly and was able to view it for approximately 45 seconds.  We went back in at 8:04pm after spending roughly 60 seconds after it disappeared watching to see if anything else became visible. After thinking about it overnight, I suppose the object could have been a Chinese lantern.  The light never looked like flame and seemed a lot brighter than that relative to its distance, but I suppose it could have been a glow inside a paper orb.  The apparent direction (SouthEast, East, then North) could have been an illusion and the actual direction more of a straight eastward arc with the light burning brightly at first (thus larger), then lessening (thus seeming to move northwards).  However, if so the launch was pretty much a failure (the lantern would have risen in one neighborhood and burned out in another a mile or so apart).;38.8121000000001;-94.534
Bright orange lights hovered then disappeared.;2013-12-10 20:00:00;3 minutes;Bright orange lights hovered then disappeared. My husband, myself and two kids were traveling east on 163rd street from I-49. I noticed two lights off in the distance hovering about 2000 ft off the ground.  They were at a 45 from each other, one was higher and the second was lower and to the left.  Everyone in the car is now looking at the lights trying to figure out what they are.  They looked like two aircraft flying coming directly towards you except the light was brighter and more of an orange color. As we are coming up the street, a row of houses blocked our view of the distant sky. We lost sight of the lights for appx. 15 seconds.  Once we got a clear view again, the lights were gone. The inside of that car was dead silent as we were just trying to figure but what type of aircraft that was, now the two object were gone.  We are now at the corner if Kentucky and 163rd street, which is open sky without obstruction. 2 objects, that size and distance, at that altitude couldn't have left our airspace in 15 seconds.  Also, planes would fly that close to one another.;38.8121000000001;-94.534
