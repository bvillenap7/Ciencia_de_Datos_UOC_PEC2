High speed silent object Belton, MO.;2015-03-16 11:35:00;30 seconds;High speed silent object Belton Mo I was at work today sitting at my desk.  The office door was open.  Thought I heard geese flying over.   Went outside to look for them and noticed a white object moving straight north.  Thought maybe it was a single goose, and started realizing that this was an aircraft, but it was moving at an extremely high speed and made zero sound.   It was white with a black spot on the bottom.;38.8121000000001;-94.534
