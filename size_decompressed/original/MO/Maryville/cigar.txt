I first saw the object from a distance of about 3 ½ miles. At first I presumed it was a helicopter as there is a helicopter club within 12 miles of the area. It was a very bright white/pale blue light and stood out as there are no homes or other light sources for another 5 miles further down the road. When I got within 1 ½ miles of the object, I began to doubt if it was a helicopter as the entire body of the object seemed to be illuminated. Travelling at a constant speed of 45 mph towards the object, I slowed to 25 mph when I got within ½ mile of the object. The object was about 200 ft to the right of the road. I passed the object slowly at about 10 mph just to observe it. It stood completely still, and was completely covered in a bright pale blue light. My view of the object was obscured slightly by a 6 foot tall hedge, but I could still see it clearly. The object was a tube shape or ‘cigar’ shape and I would estimate it was almost 90 foot long and 10 foot high and wide. Although I am not absolutely positive about this, I recall it making a faint sizzling sound, but can’t be sure as at the time I was not concentrating on the sound. With my passengers side window open by two inches, the temperature in my trucks cabin increased by about 50 degrees, and I believe that this heat was produced by the object. It was a quiet night and for the entire 20 mile journey I took, I saw nobody on the road, nobody driving or anybody walking. I presume that the object was in the field before I left Maryville and it was still visible in my wing-mirror for another 2 miles after I passed it. I’ve known this stretch of road for more than 25 years and use it as many as 8 times a week and have never seen anything like this before.  On the 19th I used the road again and stopped at the side of the field where the object was on the 18th. The object was not there, and there were al! so no si gns that it had been there either as none of the grass was scorched, which I had expected it to be. I am not sure if this object was manmade or not made by man, or simply a natural occurrence, but I am positive that it was not a helicopter, of any other vehicle either.;40.3436999999999;-94.8787000000001
