white disappearing lights;2000-10-01 21:30:00;about-30sec;white disappearing lights Icame outside on sunday oct 1st around 9:30-9:45PM to look at the stars. I was looking to north then I turned around to look south. Then I noticed these two white lights that were parallel to each other. Then the two lights started to lift off at an angle toward the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Description is not inconsistent with landing lights on approaching aircraft, but we do not know what the inidividual witnessed.  PD));40.3436999999999;-94.8787000000001
Amber Lights in formation, and then changing alignment;2003-10-15 23:00:00;10 Seconds;Amber Lights in formation, and then changing alignment My roomate and myself were out on our deck looking at stars when all of the sudden we both saw something peculiar at the same point.  There were 4 Amber colored lights flying in a diamond formation.  They were approximately 3-5000 ft up in the air.  We followed them for a few seconds, then all of the sudden the diamond formation broke and they aligned in a straight line, flying at an angle.  The change in formation was something so perfect and symmetrical that no conventional aircraft could pull off.  The craft were flying fairly fast, and were gone after a few seconds.  We were both amazed, and agreed that it was nothing of this planet.  After ten minutes or so, the amber lights appeared again.  This time they were once again travelling in the diamond, returning from the direction that they went the first time.  They stayed in the diamond the entire time they went across the sky, which wasn't long because of the speed in which they were moving.  I've never seen anything like it in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) Four Amber lights in formation, and then changing alignment This is just to amend the report I made on 5/26/04.  It should have been listed as approx. 10/15/2003 instead of 2002.  I also incorrectly labeled it as a Light, when I think formation would be more appropriate.  I'm also a little fuzzy on the altitude, they seemed lower than most conventional jet flight, yet traveled just as fast while creating now discernable sound.  Previous submission below.

Unusually fast bright white light moving from horizon to horizon.;2014-07-03 21:15:00;60 seconds;Unusually fast bright white light moving from horizon to horizon At approximately 9: 15 P.M. (sunset 8:53 pm) I stepped out on to my deck,as is common for me in the evening.  As I  looked to the south and saw the Moon (waxing crescent) and a few of the brighter early evening starts.  I noticed a bright white star that was moving from southwest to the south east.  At first I thought it was the I.S.S. as it was a at least as bright if not brighter than that object,but it was moving notably faster in my estimation. Then I remembered according to NASA Spot the Station  the station was not visible from my location on July the 3rd. I went back inside to get my Binoculars (less than half a minute), but it was gone by the time I returned. NOTE:  The I.S.S. will not be visible till about the middle of this month. If this was not the I.S.S., I have no idea.  Satellites do not move that fast, and meteors look different and move faster.  I would like to know if anyone else saw this and might have an idea of what it was.  As for me it was a note worthy event. While this is my first report, I have experience in Astronomy as a regular star gazer (as a hobby) and was an Astronomy Field Lab Assistant in college.  I regularly sight the I.S.S. and note the movement of orbiting satellites etc. Thank you for your time and consideration.  My location is Maryville, Missouri 64468 (northwest Missouri located about 50 miles north of St. Joseph Missouri on U.S. Highway 71)  Longitude: 40 20.6' N, 94 52.2' W  Time zone: -6:00 (Central) DST observance:  Thank again for all the work you do.

One point of light split into three points of light.;2014-09-12 23:50:00;2 seconds;One point of light split into three points of light. I was facing NNE at ~11:50 from Northwest University and saw a white point of light fall downward from left to right at a pretty steep angle.  The point of light split into three smaller points and eventually faded off.   Both the single point and the three points had a trail behind them.   This all happened in ~two seconds.   It was roughly 30° above ground level.   I would be willing to guess it was a meteor.   Even if it’s not a UFO this is just to help report and confirm any other similar sightings at this place and time.

All were flying in same path and evenly spaced except for 2 of them were close together, tail one was offset to the side a little.
