On this evening, 06/24/12, my fiancee and I were sitting on the back deck talking and just star watching, when we saw a bright white light in the sky. The light did not appear to be as high as an airplane would fly. It came from the north west and was heading south west. It flew over us, and as it passed us, we could not hear any sound. It continued heading south west, but all we could see was the bright white light. I thought it may be the landing lights of an airplane when it was heading at us, but when it went over us and continued on, the light never disappeared, and we never saw the flashing lights like an airplane.  Again, no sound. I watched the object fly past us until it was about to diappear behind some trees, then the light began to dim, then it just went out. There was no other lights that came on like a plane, it just disappeared. I watched for a bit and never saw any more lights from it. As we continued to sit on the deck, and discuss the incident, we actually saw two more lights, each at separate times. Still within about ten minutes of each other. None of the lights made any sound, and all three, the light faded then disappeard. No sound, and no other lights seen any where around them. They all just seemed to disappear.;36.9994;-91.9419
