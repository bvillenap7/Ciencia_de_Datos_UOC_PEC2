Star-looking object that moved unnaturally with different colored lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD));2016-07-30 23:15:00;unknown;Star-looking object that moved unnaturally with different colored lights. My husband and I witnessed what I initially thought was a star, SW of our location, until the star began to move erratically.  It stayed in basically the same location but would move in a circle or quickly dart to the right or left.   The object was low in the sky but looked to be as far away from earth as a star. We watched it for about 15 minutes.  We looked through binoculars and could tell it had red and green/blue lights that flashed occasionally.   We do not have anything else powerful enough to have seen it clearly. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD));38.7626;-90.9342999999999
