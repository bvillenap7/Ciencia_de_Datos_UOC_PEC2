Bright ball of light in Webb City;2020-10-21 19:30:00;2 minutes;Bright ball of light in Webb City This was at night about 30 minutes past sunset in a residential neighborhood. The UFO was spotted already moving in the sky from West to East. At first, I thought it was a small plane like a crop duster since there’s a local airport about 1/2 mile northwest of my location. However, a plane had just taken off and could be seen and heard headed South and was much larger in appearance. This UFO looked like a light orange ball of light and seemed to maintain a constant speed. As it passed directly overheard I listened for sounds of whirring if it were a drone, but heard none. A jet took off from the airport shortly after it passed directly overhead and appeared to be headed in the direction of the UFO. By the time it reached the UFO, you could tell the UFO was much higher in the sky. The jet turned north a bit and the UFO fell beyond my line of sight. Due to the difference in heights, it was hard to compare sizes, but it looked like it would still be smaller tha! n the jet had they been at the same height. The light was much brighter coming from the UFO than the jet’s lights despite the jet having been closer.;37.1461;-94.4753
