Large triangle shape minicing stars hovering close to ground  ((NUFORC Note:  Triplet of satellites, we suspect.  PD));2004-08-25 23:00:00;15 minues;Large triangle shape minicing stars hovering close to ground While listening to my beagle run, 8/25, i naturaly was star gazing. in the s.e. sky i notice what i assumed to be a constalation of stars with a plane flying under or threw the skies, there was several other jets in the sky being on a natural flight path. Watching, a triangle shape of stars was moving with the light moving s.e..  It was apparent that it was a craft of some type hovering closer to earth than the other jets in the sky.  You could have placed 20 other jets inside the area, judging from the size of the other planes in the sky. It moved slowly out of sight, so slow i used limbs in trees to mark its progress, after about 15 minutes it was out of sight. This is the 3 or 4 time i've seen unexplainable objects in our region in the last several years, from lasting just seconds to several hours. Most seem to minic other lights or shapes naturally in our region. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed what we believe are three satellites, possibly part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite system.  PD));38.1948;-91.9387
