Cigar shaped craft with colored port holes moves slowly over tree tops.;1972-06-01 23:00:00;10 minutes;Cigar shaped craft with colored port holes moves slowly over tree tops. In the summer of 1972 my parents purchased vacation property in the Ozarks of Missouri near Vienna.  The first night we stayed there, my parents put my brother, sister and myself to bed, and sat on the front porch that overlooked a 35 acre lake on the property.  At some point my mother spotted an unusal light moving from her left (east) field of vision to her right (west) field of vision very close to the tree tops.  She asked my father what type of plane that it was.  My father had been a military pilot his whole life and noted that it did not look like a plane.  The object moved across their field of vision until it was right in front of them across the lake at tree top level and stopped (about 1/4 mile away). It looked cigar shaped and small port holes of different colors could be seen along it's sides.  It made a continuse humming sound. After serveral minutes it moved off.  My parents related this story to us kids the next morning at breakfast.  The only other unusal thing that happened was that a brand new station wagon that my parents had purchased would not start the next day, the battery had been drained.
