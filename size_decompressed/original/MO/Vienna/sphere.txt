A round..white..shiny sphere hovering in the sky over Missouri.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible celestial body??  PD));2004-07-21 10:00:00;almost 4 hours;A round..white..shiny sphere hovering in the sky over Missouri. While i was house-sitting for friends on vacation..i was outside and saw the B2 bomber fly over Fort Leonard Wood here in Missouri. I watched for it the next day and saw it flying behind a tanker on a midair refueling training flight and took pictures. The next day i went outside..looked up..and saw this shiny object. I first thought it was an F-16 or some other small jet and looked at it through my binocuar/camera. It was a round..white..and shiny. It NEVER moved and i watched it for almost 4 hours. I finally went in the house..came out..looked up..and it was gone. I watched for 5 more days and never saw it again...there. I came back home and a couple of days later..i went outside here to see if i could see it again. I did! I got out my 36x spotting scope and saw that it was a white..round..and shiny sphere. I could even see the shadow that it cast on itself from the sun! It clouded up then and and i couldn`t see it anymore that day...or since then.  I keep looking though.

Sphere shaped object..again!;2004-08-29 06:45:00;25 seconds;Sphere shaped object..again! This is a follow-up to the report that i filed on 8/19/04. Ever since i saw this object and was able to take pictures....i`ve watched for it whenever i`m sitting outside and able to. I bar-b-qued today and was sitting there with my binocular/camera looking up at the sky every once in a while. I looked up one time and saw my possible celestial body moving at a high rate of speed across the sky. Not streaking..but faster than a passenger plane.  I was able to get two photos of it before it was gone. One was blurry..but the other one was good. I`m sending it in.;38.1948;-91.9387
