MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  I looked up in the sky and saw this bright shiny object.;2005-08-04 10:00:00;4 hours;I was house-sitting for someone and i went out on their deck with my binocluar/camera to watch their game feeder. I looked up in the sky and saw this bright shiny object. At first..i thought it was an airplane but it never moved. I got my binocular/camera and took some pictures of it. It`s a cheap camera..but i got a couple of fairly good shots of it. It was really bright and reflected the sun like it had chrome on it. I`ll send you a picture.  I forgot to say that i watched it for almost 4 hours! I finally went back inside to get another soda and when i came back..it was gone. Just like that!  I wasn`t gone very long. Maybe 2 minutes.
