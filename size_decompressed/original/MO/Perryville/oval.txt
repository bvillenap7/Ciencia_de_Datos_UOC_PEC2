The craft was big, orange, and oval shaped.;2000-10-10 03:00:00;3 minutes;The craft was big, orange, and oval shaped. I am a 48 year old mother of three grown children. I have been having trouble sleeping for the last three or four nights, therefore I was up at 3:30 a.m. on 10/10/00. I couldn't go back to sleep, so I went into the kitchen, got a Diet Coke, then went into the livingroom, sat down on the couch, and turned my lamp off. There was a glow that I could see out the window, and my first thought was my daughters house is on fire, her house is located about 100 feet west of my house, with nothing obstructing the view. This is what made me get off the couch and look, and I couldn't believe what I saw. It was solid orange, with no blinking lights, and my guess is it was about the size of a football field, and it was hovering over my daughters house. It hovered for about three minutes then it was gone.;37.7167;-89.8775999999998
