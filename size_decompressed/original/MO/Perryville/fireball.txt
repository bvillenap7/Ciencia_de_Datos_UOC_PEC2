FAST MOVING, COLOR CHANGING OBJECT.;1998-08-15 11:00:00;2 minutes;FAST MOVING, COLOR CHANGING OBJECT. ME AND 2 OTHERS WAS GOING DOWN A COUNTY ROAD OUT BY OLD APPLETON, MO.  ALL OF A SUDDEN THE TRUCK JUST DIES AND WILL NOT START LIKE THE BATTERY DOESNT HAVE ANY CHARGE.  WE TRIED TO START IT ABOUT 10 MINUTES LATER AND IT STARTS.WE GO ABOUT 1 MILE DOWN THE GRAVEL ROAD AND THIERS A ROUND BALL FLOATING ABOVE SOME POWER WIRES.  IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME BUT MY FRIEND JUMPS OUT AND TRIED TO THROW A ROCK AT IT.  IT WAS ABOUT 100-150 FEET OFF THE GROUND.  HE THREW THE ROCK AND IT SHOT UP AND DOWN, LEFT AND RIGHT.  IT MOVED 3 TIMES FASTER THAN ANYTHING IVE SEEN IN THE SKY AND CHANGED COLORS EVERY TIME IT WOULD MOVE A DIFFRENT WAY.  IT MADE VERY SHARP TURNS THAT OUR AIRCRAFT CANT MAKE AT EXTREME SPEEDS AND EVERY TIME IT MADE A TURN, IT CHANGED COLORS.  RED, BLUE, GREEN, AND ORANGE.  IT MADE LIKE A PATTERN OF DOING THIS AND SHOT STRAIT UP.  THIER WAS A BIG FLASH OF LIGHT AND IT WAS GONE.  IT ACTED ALMOST LIKE WHEN MY FRIEND THREW THE ROCK AT IT,IT THOUGHT IT WAS BEING ATTACKED THE WAY IT MOVED WHEN IT WAS THROWN.   I TALKED TO THE OTHER 2 WITH ME RECENTLY AND THEY BOTH STILL REMEMBER IT ALSO AS I DO.THE OBJECT ALSO HAD A TAIL OF LIGHT BEHIND IT THE SAME COLOR.  IT WOULD MOVE LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, RIGHT, ETC, AT MIND BLOWING SPEEDS.  IT WAS MOVING SO FAST AND COLORFUL THAT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE IT WAS TRYING TO MAKE SOME TYPE OF SHAPE IN THE SKY.  IT WAS DARK OUTSIDE.;37.7167;-89.8775999999998
