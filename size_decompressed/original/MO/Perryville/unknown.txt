Unusual and almost deafening rumbling noise that sounded very low but could not be seen!;2015-01-11 16:30:00;7 minutes;Unusual and almost deafening rumbling noise that sounded very low but could not be seen! I live about 90 miles south of the St Louis airport.  It's normally very quiet here.  On Jan 11 and 12, I heard and felt massive rumbling.  I've lived on air force bases and this sounded like we were living at the end of the runway. On Jan 11, at about 4 pm, I was outside, when this loud jet sound (like a C5) began.  It was slightly overcast and I could not see it or really determine what direction it was coming from. I actually expected a massive plane to come through the clouds and crash.  I felt the rumbling and the roar was as loud as being at the end of the runway when B-52's or C-5's are taking off.  It sounded very close. While I often hear and see aircraft flying, they are very high in the sky and cannot be heard inside my home.  This lasted 7 min or so and then just suddenly stopped.  I dismissed it as some kind of military exercise even though i don't live near a military base. On Jan 12, at about 10:30 am it happened again.  This time I was inside my home and it felt like it had to be directly over the house.  I went outside but once again, it was slightly overcast and I couldn't see anything.  This lasted about 10 min and stopped suddenly. A few days later, I asked my husband if he had heard of any military presence in the area.  I told him what happened, and he said it could have been aircraft testing of some sort, but that he was not aware of any exercises.   Today, I was browsing UFO reports for an entirely different reason and noted two reports on Jan. 11 describing the same sounds I heard on the 11th and 12th.  It never occurred to me that this noise was unidentified...;37.7167;-89.8775999999998
