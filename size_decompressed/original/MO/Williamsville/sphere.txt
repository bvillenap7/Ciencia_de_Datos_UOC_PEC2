Amber orb floats quickly across the sky;2010-06-16 01:00:00;15 seconds;Amber orb floats quickly across the sky The observers were three in number a retired police officer, his 40 year old  son and a 18 year old male.  It was 1:00 am and the three witnesses were outside their cabin at the Chaonia Landing resort doing some star gazing.  It was a brilliant star field and the Milky Way weaved a misty pattern in the night sky.  A lightly illuminated orb seemed to suddenly float across the sky.  No sound and about the size of an asprin tablet in the sky.  It floated acrosss the sky from one horizon and disappeared on the other.  It took only a dozen to 15 seconds and was gone.  You could see it diappear briefly behind a few puffs of clouds and quickly reappear.  It had a floating action, but moved at considerable speed at a 60 degree angle from the horizon, seemingly faster than a plane would.  It appeared to be self illuminated by a low intensity orange amber glow.   I never saw anything quite like it before and it is the first time I saw anything in the sky I could not explain! .;36.9624;-90.4913
