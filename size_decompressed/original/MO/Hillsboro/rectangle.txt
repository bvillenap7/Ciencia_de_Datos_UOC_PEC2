Oblong shaped iridescent lime green light traveling West to East.;2014-06-21 04:45:00;15 seconds;In my previous report is an error: there were no lights.  The object itself was lit. 20 minutes after waking up and sitting on a sofa in our North facing sunroom, between the trees I saw an oblong shaped iridescent lime green light traveling West to East.  2-3 times it dropped what looked to be an orange spark off the rear.   Lasted about 15 seconds.;38.2570000000002;-90.5800999999994
