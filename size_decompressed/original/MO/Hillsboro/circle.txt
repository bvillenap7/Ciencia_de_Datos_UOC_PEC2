I live in Missouri and i am currently  working for the Census Bureau. Saturday evening, on my way home from work, i  witnessed a strange occurance, which I have described breifly  below. I was driving down C highway  (Hillsboro), heading towards Y highway(Hillsboro, DeSoto) @ about 7:30p.m. To  the left of me was a series of  large fields And behind them were large  tree--covered hills   In the sky high above the hills was a  single object, a bright red perfect circle, moving slowly down in a straight  line, a leaving a trail of smoke behind it   As it feel it never seemed to gain  speed, the circle grew bigger and brighter, the trail of smoke also grew. It  finally descended behind the trees leaving the trail of smoke.    I never heard any sounds and although  I looked for it, I never saw it again, or determined what it was.   The entire ordeal took about 10-15  minutes the object was visible for a long stretch of the  road. My question is, do you have any idea  what this could have been? It was definately there. I ruled out fireworks,  because there was no noise and it moved very slowly. I have never seen an  airplane go straight down, either crashing or landing besides, if it had been a  plane crash or something like that it would have been on the news. The area is  outside of city limits, and mostly farm land. The closest airport (which is very small) is two towns away (Festus/Crystal City);38.2570000000002;-90.5800999999994
