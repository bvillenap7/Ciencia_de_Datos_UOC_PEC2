I thought because of how loud it was, it might be a stealth bomber because the are air bases close by it's not all that uncommon.   I went out side on the front porch to see if I could see anything and I looked up to the northeast and saw a massive string of lights.  The lights had to be one a singles craft.  What ever this was it was to slow to be a plane.   ,I live next to an airport.  I know what that looks like.  You could not see the craft just the outline because of the lights.  It was so loud, others have had to have seen this.  If anyone else knows anything, please share.   This was the size of a city in the sky.  As far as I know, we don't have anything this large that can fly.;38.2667;-94.3097
