I was at my eldest brothers house just chatting with him, when I noticed a bright light in the sky. It was different, much shinier then the stars were. It was like yellow. I yelled across the street to my other brother who happened to be out in his yard that there was something up in the sky. I continued to watch it as it had appeared to lift straight up and then continue towards the east before dissapearing out of view.;38.2667;-94.3097
