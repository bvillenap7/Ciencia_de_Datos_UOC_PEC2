Chevron shaped object over my barn pasture and over the lake.;2005-11-22 19:40:00;15 Minutes;Chevron shaped object over my barn pasture and over the lake. On Tuesday November 22, 2005 at 7:40 P.M. at my pasture at at my barn I saw a chevron shaped object it was a very bright blue with a white tail on it. It blinked and hovered over the barn. And it went down by the lake. And I went in my barn and saw it in the distance. It changed to a bright orange and it got lower and lower and reflected over the lake. And I went down by the lake and looked back at the barn and the object was gone. Then I looked to the west and saw another light it was a yellowish with a white tail moving at a very very fast rate of speed. It was cloudy outside. I didn't see the object no more that I saw at my barn. So I got in my car and went back into town.;38.2667;-94.3097
((HOAX??))  I was heading driving to the store when I seen a red and yellow lighted craft in the air flying 1000 ft or less strobing.;2010-01-10 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;I was heading driving to the store when I seen a red and yellow lighted craft in the air flying 1000 ft or less strobing.  It seemed as if it was going at a pretty fast speed and then all of a sudden looked as if it slowed and turned sideways. I could not hear any noise from the object.  But may have seen another red flashing light, which was smaller real close to it as it had slowed or was turning.  Almost as if it came from the object or was a part of the object.  It was flying pretty low so I did get a pretty good look at it.  When it appeared to slow down/turn I could tell it was kind of chevron shaped,like a boomerang looking object.  It was moderate in size, probably a couple car lengths.  I stopped to try to see more, but by this point it was gone.
