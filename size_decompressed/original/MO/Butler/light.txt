((HOAX??))  Me and another person seen a white shaped ball of light traveling through the sky.;2008-07-04 05:30:00;2-3 minutes;Me and another person seen a white shaped ball of light traveling through the sky. I was outside on my front porch smoking a ciggeratte with my father in law, when we seen a ball shaped light suddenly come out of the Northwestern sky. It really kind of just popped up as the sky had been clear only a moment before.  We sit and watched it as it was slowly moving to the north east going maybe 40 mph if that. I ran inside and grabbed my binocoluars to get a better look at what it was but could still only identify it as a white ball of light. It quickly sped up and vanished out of view as we last seen it heading to the northeast. ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source of alleged sightings of UFO's.

((HOAX??))  2 objects seen fairly shortly after one another,starlike looking objects.;2009-03-20 17:00:00;7-10 minutes;2 objects seen fairly shortly after one another,starlike looking objects. Me and my brother seen 1 object, a white light fly through the sky at a pretty mild and steady pace. This object was very high up and was seen moving from south to north. Within 20 minutes I'd say we witnessed another object of the same color come out of the east and then begin to cross to the north. It's direction was a straight line I might add. It didn't seem too make any sudden movements or anything to that extent. However, we know that it did not make any sound whatsoever. Also, there were sever other aircraft seen coming from the east going west at the time. So who knows but we were able to catch it and I'd figure i'd post it. I seriously doubt that these were satelites given what time of day we were witnessing these objects. ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source of alleged sightings of UFO's.

I watched it for several minutes. I then watched as it came closer and lowered altitude at the same speed. Looking as if it was hovering downward now. This object was several thousand feet up, but very visable. There were other objects in the sky at that time. But only 1 was strobing blue and white lights very fast. Back and forth, back and forth. And then they left after about 10 minutes or so. I had 1 more person witness exactly what I saw, and two others that saw the yellow light in the sky. Just a day before I witnessed a blinking red object that stopped on a dime and did a 180 turn. It was reported. ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source of alleged sightings of UFO's.
