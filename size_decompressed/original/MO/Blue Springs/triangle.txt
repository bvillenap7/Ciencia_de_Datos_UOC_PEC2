Giant city in sky that;2014-11-15 00:00:00;12/15/2014;Giant city in sky that I know this is very late but I didn't know there was a place to contact after seeing this but I'm currently watching the hangar 1 documentary on netflix and I saw the floating city.ill explain, I got off a nightshift at Jack in the box in blue springs a little after 10 ish.this was before I had my car and close to Thanksgiving.  I start walking down coronado rd up to st mary's hospital and I turn right thru the first business and walk thru the open field at St Mary's. As I'm walking I'm listening to music looking down and the field lit up. Now at St Mary there is lights in the parking lots but they don't light up the field that's in-between the church And hospital. But as I'm walking the field lights up, but it wasn't a light beaming down it was lights on the aircraft. As I glance my head up I stop and stare, the air craft was like a croissant. and in white/blue/silver ish lights were all over it. in the time I thought what the hell it was gone. ! But when it left, it left the same as you see in movies. It's body seemed to stretch out into space. If needed to get an exact date I can pull up pay stand and check when I got my car and a couple other things that's just a rough estimate;39.0169;-94.2856794392522
