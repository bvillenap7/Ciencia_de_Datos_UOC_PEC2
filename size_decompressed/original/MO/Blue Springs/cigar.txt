Long object with no lights and birds seen underneath during a lunar eclipse about 35 feet above the ground;2008-02-20 19:45:00;1 minute;Long object with no lights and birds seen underneath during a lunar eclipse about 35 feet above the ground The object I saw was about 20 minutes before the lunar eclipse was in the earth's shadow. I was looking out my window facing east and a object appeared about 15 feet above the trees and was flat on the front, and long, longer than my house.  I could distinctly see an outline but there were no lights or sound. about 1 foot inside and under the edges, were many birds. These birds were white and flying into each other and in no kind of formation, almost like they were confused.  I saw many other birds all around, but the other birds were flying in a V.  The object was moving about 35 to 40 m.p.h. heading west about a mile south of I-70 headed directly for downtown Kansas City. I yelled at my wife after about 15 seconds of looking directly at it and she came into the bedroom and looked and saw the end of the object.  She explains that when she saw it, it was like a perfectly straight object, almost like a giant ruler.  I am convinced that what I saw was genuine, and to the best of my ability, true.;39.0169;-94.2856794392522

It was moving NNW and appeared to be in between RD Mize and HWY 7 in blue springs.  Saw it out my window, then ran around out on the porch to see if maybe it was just a blackhawk helicopter and it was silent, very large, and low for a jet, if it was it would be comparable to a Jumbo Jet in size.  Shape was vague but cigarish, possibly domed or thicker in the middle.;39.0169;-94.2856794392522
