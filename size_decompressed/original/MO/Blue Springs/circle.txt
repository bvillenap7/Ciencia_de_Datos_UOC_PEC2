At least 12 large round bright red lights seen in sky East of Blue Springs, MO on July 1, 2012;2012-07-01 21:45:00;3 minutes;At least 12 large round bright red lights seen in sky East of Blue Springs, MO on July 1, 2012 On July 1st I was driving my van, East bound on I-70 Hwy and was just outside Blue Springs, MO which is a suburb of Kansas City, MO.  I had two friends in the car with me and we were heading to Columbia, MO.  It was about 9:45 pm when all of a sudden we noticed that there were at least 12 red ball lights in the sky.  They spanned from south of I-70 to north of I-70. I was totally in awe and could not imagine what the sight might be.  I was traveling at about 70 mph and did not want to pull onto the shoulder of the road for fear of being hit.  As it was, I was driving erratically because I was so shaken by what I was seeing and wanted to continually be looking at the sky.  I immediately called a friend who lives in KC and told her to turn on the news and see if she might see something about the lights on the news.  It was then that she told me that there had been UFO sightings for the past month out in the Blue Springs, MO area.   The next day I began searching for information about what we saw and could not find anything. However now that I have been directed to your website I have seen several pictures of exactly what we saw which makes me at least feel like I am not losing my mind.   Just last night my husband and I witnessed another UFO and I will file a separate report on that one.;39.0169;-94.2856794392522
