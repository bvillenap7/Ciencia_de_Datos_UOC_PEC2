Fireball moving across the sky east to west during July 4th fireworks;2011-07-04 21:20:00;3 minutes;Fireball moving across the sky east to west during July 4th fireworks On Monday evening, July 4th, my wife, son, my son’s girlfriend and I retreated to the back deck to let my 1 year-old grandson watch the neighborhood fireworks.  The time, as I recall now, must have been a little after 9 pm (2100 hrs).  There was still a little light in the western sky, but our deck faces east, and already our neighbors were lighting their fireworks.   Approximately 9:20 or so, I looked into the southeast sky and saw a ‘fireball,’ for lack of a better description, moving slowly, traveling east to west.  I didn’t mention it to the others, at that moment, because I had lost sight of it behind a large tree in our backyard, and wasn’t sure that it was not a plane, or just another firework.   I would say it was flying about 2-3000 feet or so (hard to determine).  About 5-10 minutes later, another (or the same) ‘fireball’ appeared almost on the exact path or trajectory moving again, east to west.  This time, my son, 23, saw it and pointed it out to all of us, and exclaimed, What is that?  Is it a UFO?   I told him I didn’t know but that this was the second time I saw it.   I ran in to get the camera but it had traveled out of sight.  I did see it 2 more times, this time following it from the front porch into the western sky where it just became a small dot.   I’m surprised no one in our town or neighbors mentioned this sighting.  I haven’t yet had time to download the pictures or video I took into my computer.  The times the ‘fireballs’ were spotted were apx 9:20, 9:35, and 9:45.   It was a light colored magenta, not brilliant, but certainly not an airplane indicator light that flashes in a constant rhythmic pattern, more like a flame on a stove or burner unit.;39.0169;-94.2856794392522
Orange sphere burning at the center appears over my house;2011-08-02 22:30:00;about 45 seconds;orange sphere burning at the center appears over my house Me and a friend were swimming in my pool and had been watching meteors all night and then out of nowhere a bright orange sphere just appeared overhead about 3 or 4 hundred feet up.  It was burning at the center but made no noises whatsoever.   We both watched it hover in one spot for about 5 to 10 seconds, and then it just started to move towards the horizon.  It didn't move much faster than a bird would fly id say.  We watched it disappear over the horizon and then asked each other if we really just saw that.  We saw many planes criss crossing the area for about 30 minutes after it disappeared too.   I would have gotten a picture but I was soaking wet and my phone was across the yard;39.0169;-94.2856794392522
