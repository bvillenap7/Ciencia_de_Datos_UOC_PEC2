Black box standing still about 100 feet above the trees with 4 large antennas (possibly);2000-03-15 14:46:00;45 seconds;Black box standing still about 100 feet above the trees with 4 large antennas (possibly) I was driving west at 2:46 p.m.  About 100 feet above the trees maybe a mile away was an object in the sky standing still. When I first saw it I was thinking someone's roof blew off their house but it wasn't windy and the object was perfectly still. I was coming to a stop sign so I was barely moving in the car. I stopped and just watched it for about 20 seconds.  The object looked like a rectangular box standing upright which was black. Out of each corner it looked like a giant post or antenna sticking out diagnally maybe about 10 feet long. Those were harder to make out.  So after being stopped in the car watching it, not even moving, it spun 90 degrees and got thin. The size would be about 30 foot tall, 20 foot wide and 8 foot thick. If you held a dice in your fingers at arm length then that would possibly be the size of it. A car was coming up behind me so I turned north and looked back and it was gone. No sound or lights coming from object.;39.0169;-94.2856794392522
10+lights in the sky over Blue Springs;2011-11-25 19:10:00;1 min;10+lights in the sky over Blue Springs Was pulling in to my mother in-laws driveway .  as i was, i was also calling him telling him i was outside.as i was pressing the hang-up button . out my peripheral saw a bright object on a dark backdrop.   as my eyes focused i noticed 15 or 20 lights . from what i could tell it was flying at a odd angle.  Looked as if it was circle on the bottom outlined with 3 or 4 bright white lights . and had 2 more bright lights little closer together and above the outer ones with one more bright white light above those 2 with little tiny lights along what seemed to be seems of a frame of sorts.   Eyes adjusting more, u could see a outline of a solid object.  I was just looking at it dumbfounded and back at the house hoping my brother in law would walk out..  and sure enough soon as he walked outside i lost sight of it behind a tree and house. .... then 2 days later me and my wife decided to Google it. come to find out there was 9 or more people that scene it and a guy from work! .  2 reports online said it separated into individual light;39.0169;-94.2856794392522
