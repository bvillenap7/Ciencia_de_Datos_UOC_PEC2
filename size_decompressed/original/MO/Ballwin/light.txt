A low altitude slow moving extremely bright light.;2010-06-26 21:30:00;3 minutes;A low altitude slow moving extremely bright light. We stepped outside around 9:30 PM.  As we walked out past the carport, my friend looked up and pointed out a light moving slowly across the sky.   As soon as I looked, I could tell it was out of the ordinary.  It was a very bright white light.  No port or starboard lights or any other normal aircraft lights.   It appeared to be around 20,000 to 25,000 feet moving from west south west to east north east.  It never changed in brightness and completely crossed from horizon to horizon.   There was no noise.  We are in a flight path and can hear planes clearly even a cruising altitude.    We made a police report to document the date and time.;38.5851121212121;-90.5283632996633

Saw three orange colored fireball type lights to the east forming somewhat of triangle, 2 stayed east 1 went up to NW direction;2012-06-24 02:30:00;1-2 minutes;Saw three orange colored fireball type lights to the east forming somewhat of triangle, 2 stayed east 1 went up to NW direction Saw three orange colored fireball type lights to the east forming somewhat of triangle, pretty bright, could see them out the sliding glass door and they seemed stationary at first.  Two of them moved further east or dropped below the horizon and the third high up light, then moved from the east upwards towards the north/northwest passing overhead just to the north of where I was standing. It seemed to be at a pretty high altitude, listened for a sound and there was not any. All of these objects definitely looked as if they were control movements.  Tried to get my tablet/camera up and running but they were gone.;38.5851121212121;-90.5283632996633
