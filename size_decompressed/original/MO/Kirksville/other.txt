Large, red  jellyfish-shaped UFO crossing night sky;1998-11-16 02:30:00;< 1 second;Large, red  jellyfish-shaped UFO crossing night sky Was watching Leonids when I saw this craft race across the entire night sky in about 1/2 second went from horizon to horizon.  It looked something like a jellyfish, or an LED, the rounded tip as the front.  Coloring was glowing red at the front.  I do not believe this was one of the meteors because I saw shape around it, someting like Wonder Woman's tranparent airplane.  Also, this came up over the horizon from the northwest, not from above  as the meteors came into view.  It was also MUCH larger than any of the meteors, if it HAD been one, would have devastated a large area of the Earth. I waited so long to report because I didn't know there was anyplace to report to anymore. This is a rural area, no military bases anywhere around except one that closed decades ago.
