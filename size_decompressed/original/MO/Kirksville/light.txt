One light high up split into 2 orbs and eventually stopped and faded away.;2013-07-06 01:30:00;1 minute;One light high up split into 2 orbs and eventually stopped and faded away. Camping at Thousand Hills State Park, my dad saw a white light high up in the sky, while we were star gazing.  It moved much faster than any satellite we'd seen before. After watching it move for about 30 seconds it broke off into two whitish lights.  And both lights moved diagnolly from its original direction. After about 5 seconds, the bottom light stopped immediately, and slowly faded away.  The other light continued in its direction for about 5 seconds, after the first faded awa,y and immediately stopped, and after about 10 seconds, faded away just as the first.;40.1955;-92.5892000000001
