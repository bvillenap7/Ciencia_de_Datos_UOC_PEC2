Yellow-orange lights in color, wavering as if seen through heat, in a straight horizontal line.   The lights were not evenly spaced along the line but were in a perfectly straight line just above the tree line from where seen but seemed to be much further away.  There appeared to be five or six lights.  They were viewed only for a few seconds and then they went out/off in order from right to left and did not reappear.  There were two airplanes in the air at the time to the left and right of the lights.  The airplanes were not following/pursuing the lights.
