We may have been an experament;2001-07-01 22:30:00;1 hour;We may have been an experament On or about the above date a friend and I were bass fishing in the Aunts Creek area of Table Rock Lake.  As was our habit, we had been fishing from sundown and intended to fish until dawn.  At around 2330 hrs. we both noticed what appeared to be a single bright light in the area of Kimberling City which at that time was about 2 miles south and east of us.  We both assumed it was a medical helicopter based out of Springfield, Mo.  We had seen the helicopter on other nights and went about our fishing.  During the next few minutes we noticed the light didnâ€™t move from the area we originally spotted it.  In an effort to get a better view we motored up the James River Arm which would allow us to see a lower altitude in the area of the light.  After moving 2 miles upstream (away from Kimberling City) we stopped, turned and noted that there was actually more than one light.  We actually counted at this time 4 lights in what appeared close proximity with each other.  The lights were moving slowly in our direction (north-northwest) at a slow rate of speed.  Occasionally 3 of the 4 lights would hold position as one light went forward.  The separation appeared to be as much as 500-750 yards.  It would hover as the other 3 lights caught-up.  Then the same light would again scout forward, as if scouting for something.  At that time I owned a new Ranger Bass Boar equipped with a 200 HP outboard engine.  It had a top speed of around 75-MPH.  As we continued watching and noticing the way the formation was progressing we figured it might be time to vacate the area.  I tried to start the engine and while it would crank, it failed to fire.  I used the electric trolling motor to move toward an adjacent boat dock in an attempt avoid a direct overflight of the boat by the formation.  After moving about 35 yards the trolling motor began to slow.  Then it also stopped working.  There is no reasonable explanation as both the electric motor and the afore mentioned 200 HP motor later started without effort or adjustment by my friend or myself.  By now the formation was 500 or so yards away from our location and what I was referring as the Scout Craft was no more than 60 yards away.  What was really remakabke was the total lack of any noise from any helicopter rotors.  The next thing I know it was almost daylight and my friend and I were in my bass boat 15 miles        up river in the area of Galena, MO.  That time of year the sun rises at around 0625 hrs.
