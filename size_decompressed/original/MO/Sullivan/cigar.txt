Driving East on I44 after sunset - sky was still light.  Saw a cigar/lenticular shaped object, distant - it didn't appear any closer after driving 2 miles toward it.  Dark color, no visible lights, moving very slowly roughly North to South. It was below cloud level (broken clouds) which was about 12.000 ft. I decided this was not an aircraft of any kind I recognized and began to move to the shoulder of the highway so I could get a camera and field glasses.  As I was looking at it, it simply vanished. It did not go behind a cloud, it did not visibly speed up and move off.  It just vanished as I was watching.
