Multiple Light Over Pea Ridge Mines seen from Sullivan, MO.;2020-08-28 20:16:00;3-7 minutes;Multiple Light Over Pea Ridge Mines seen from Sullivan, MO. Video was taken by a party who wishes to remain anonymous for the time being!  It was reported at approximately 20:16 CST. 28 August, 2020. That 3-4 bright objects were seen from the backyard of a friend's  father residence.  The skyline relative to the objects location and eyewitness approximation of distance  from his view point would have placed  The UAP over The Pea Ridge Iron Ore Mine.  Approximately 8-10 miles Southeast of the residence in Sullivan,Mo. A short video was captured on a cellphone, showing multiple objects moving erratically.  Abrupt stops, disappearing and reappearing almost instantaneously and great distance and maneuvering in ways inconsistent with any modern day Aerospace Technology that I am aware of.  I would like to share the Video Evidence.;38.2307000000001;-91.1566999999996
