Star like object flying across horizon in Dexter, MO.;2011-06-29 01:45:00;3-5 minutes;Star like object flying across horizon in Dexter, MO. I was driving west bound on US highway 60 approaching the city of Dexter, MO.  We watched a bright light, what appeared to be a star come out of a tree line.  It then slowly crossed the highway. It appeared t be hovering once it crossed highway for about 30 seconds before flying off.   It flew away rather slowly and made zero noise.  The light it gave off appeared to glow as if it were a star.  I was able to capture a couple still photos of object and a 59 second video clip with my iPhone 4.   I'm extremely curious as to what this is.  I've always been a skeptic of most UFO sightings but I have never seen anything like this.  Would love to have a logical answer to what this was. It appears to be a star except the fact it was flying across horizon.  Also when I took still images, it appears in the shape of a saucer standing up on its side.   I'm more than willing to share my photos with you.;36.7884;-89.9643000000001
