IN APRIL OF 1974,IT WAS 11:00 P.M., I KNOW BECAUSE I WAS STILL IN SCHOOL AND THAT WAS MY CURFEW WITH MY PARENTS. WE WERE ABOUT 2 BLOCKS FROM MY HOME AND STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN. I LOOKED OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW OF THE CAR (I WAS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND MY FRIEND WAS DRIVING), I SAW A DISC SHAPED CRAFT WITH A DOME ON TOP. THE CRAFT WAS ABOUT 50 FEET IN THE AIR HOVERING OVER A TREE TOP AND MAYBE 100 FEET FROM US. THE DOME HAD BRIGHT LIGHTS OF RED BLUE YELLOW GREEN AND WHITE FLASHING AROUND AND AROUND THE DOME. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO BE SILVER METALLIC. I TOLD MY FRIEND TO LOOK AND SHE SAW IT TOO.  I OPENED THE CAR DOOR AND SO DID SHE, SO WE WERE BOTH STANDING OUTSIDE THE CAR WATCHING IT. THERE WERE OTHER CARS ON THE STREET THAT WE HAD TO STOP FOR, BUT IT SEEMED LIKE NO ONE ELSE NOTICED IT BUT US. BUT IT WAS SO BRIGHT AND COLORFUL, LIKE A CARNIVAL RIDE LIT UP AT NIGHT. THE CRAFT MADE NO SOUND AT ALL. IT FINALLY JUST ROSE UP HIGHER AND DRIFTED SIDEWAYS TILL WE COULDN'T SEE IT ANYMORE.THE ODD THING IS THAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT AND I TOLD NO ONE AND I DON'T THINK SHE DID EITHER. IN 1976 I SAW THIS FRIEND AGAIN AND I SAID DID WE SEE WHAT I THOUGHT WE DID? SHE SAID YES, WE DID AND THAT IS ALL WE SAID ABOUT IT. I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO MENTION THAT IT WAS A UFO TO HER, SHE AUTOMATICALLY KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THREE MORE SIGHTINGS IN THAT GENERAL AREA, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN YEARS APART AND ALL THE CRAFT ARE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THERE BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE TO CALL IF YOU DO SEE ONE AND THERE ARE NO MILITARY BASES ANYWHERE NEAR THERE.
