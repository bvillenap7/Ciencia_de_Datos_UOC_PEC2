White, Blue and Red Flashing Light In Sky Over Dexter, MO;2012-01-06 01:20:00;2:00;White, Blue and Red Flashing Light In Sky Over Dexter, MO I have noticed in the sky late evening to early morning for the past two nights. I brought it to my wife's attention and she began to notice the object appeared to be changing colors. The object was so far away that we couldn't be sure if it was mobile or stationary in the sky. It did appear to slowly ascend. Yet we were sure it was flashing colors of white,blue and red repeatedly. I got out an old cheap telescope and we still could not clearly perceive the exact shape of the object but we could certainly tell the lights were moving in circular motion. Through the telescope we noticed several colors including: red, white, yellow, green and blue. They were all flashing and moving in a blur. This object could actually be between Dexter and Sikeston. It's difficult to tell it's exact location. It is much too high to be a tower. It can not be a helicopter or a plane. It can't be a planet because there is multi-colors and there is movement of the colors. I do not! take any drugs nor have I been consuming any alcohol. I have been up late each night because I'm on vacation. I do not suffer from insomnia nor have I ever been diagnosed with any mental illness of any kind. We are just normal people that noticed a strange flashing light in the night sky.;36.7884;-89.9643000000001
