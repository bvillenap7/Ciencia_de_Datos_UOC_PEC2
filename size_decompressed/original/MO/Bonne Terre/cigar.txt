It was moving much faster than the three planes flying in the sky at the same time.  It traveled towards the East and the light stopped glowing and we could see a very large cigar shaped object not making a sound as it passed over and continued traveling East until it was out of sight. Dogs around the area were barking very aggressively as it passed over.;37.9192;-90.5508
