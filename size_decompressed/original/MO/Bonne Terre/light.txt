There was a star next to it that was not moving for around 30 seconds.  Then it began to move to the left in a straight line slowly.  It just looked like a moving star.  But then it broke from the straight path and altered its course too quick for an airplane.  It continued in a straight line for a few minutes, moving very slow but steady.  It went across the entire sky and when it was between 2 stars it stopped.  It held its position for 2-3 minutes.  During this time I was telling at my fiance that it stopped.   Then it slowly dimmed out, twice.  Each time slowly lighting back up. Then it changed course again as it began to drop straight down below the horizon.  It dimmed out and disappeared twice more.  Each time it would dim out it would slowly reappear in the same spot it had disappeared.  Like it stopped moving to disappear and continued dropping again! once it lit up again.  Then it fell below the tree line and disappeared for good.  I watched that area of the sky for a few minutes and then I watched a shooting star shoot from the right of the object away from me.  The shooting star was low on the horizon, which was odd.  This was not a plane nor helicopter as it was too high up, moved too slow, had no flashing lights, and stayed stationary for minutes.  My fiance also witnessed this and admits it was not explainable.  I've never seen a UFO until this.  And it seemed to disguise itself as a star.  When it first began there was an airplane in the sky, way far away from this object.;37.9192;-90.5508
