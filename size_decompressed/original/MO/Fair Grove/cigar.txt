VERY bright object.;2011-02-08 07:30:00;20 seconds;VERY bright object Around 7:30 am I was traveling south just north of Fair Grove on Highway 65. The sunrise had just stated with a very orange cloud formation well to the east. I caught a glimpse of a very billiant light around 10 oclock high and well south of the sun itself. It appeared very distant maybe 15 miles away and from my location was about the same length as a penny held at arms length. It was moving south at a slow speed.   As I got off on the shoulder to take a photo a very bright shimmer went along the length of the object from the back to the front (which would contradict sunlight reflecting off anything.  It was almost like looking at a welding arc it was that bright, but from a distance.   When the light reached to front of the object it dissapeared.  The sky provided enough of a background to tell there was no plane in the air or any kind of profile of any thing against the back ground.   I never saw anything solid against the background and it was a very clear sky just at the edge of the cloud formation where the obect dissappeared  and got the impression it was more like an energy, than a solid object.  From the time I first noticed the object till it disappeared lasted 20 seconds.  I posted this as a cigar shape, although it was more like a slit .;37.3711;-93.1462
