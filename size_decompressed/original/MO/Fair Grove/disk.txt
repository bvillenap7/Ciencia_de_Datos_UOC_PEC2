My dad slowed the car and we all got out to watch it.  The lights moved faster and faster until they became a blurr, and you could no longer define one light from the other.   Suddenly both lights just dropped and were gone.   As we started towards the car there was a big flash and both lights were moving in opposite directions across the sky,green going right,yellow going left.  They shot straight up and were gone in a matter of seconds.  There is no possible way for it to be a plane.  My whole family wittnessed it and we are all in agreement of each detail.  This was not a dream.;37.3711;-93.1462
