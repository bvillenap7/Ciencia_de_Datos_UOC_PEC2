Two hovering objects vanished into thin air.;2011-02-25 12:30:00;20 seconds;Two hovering objects vanished into thin air. I was heading home around 12:30 pm on Friday the 25th of February when I saw two objects in the sky diagonal from each other.  They were almost kidney bean shaped, only bent more and were dark in color.   They just stayed there motionless for about 20 seconds and then without a sound or movement that I could see, they just vanished into thin air.  Just there one second and then gone.   I was stunned.;37.3711;-93.1462
