Rotating objected maintaining position no visible means of propulsion;2019-11-25 09:25:00;2;Rotating objected maintaining position no visible means of propulsion While performing a mapping project and monitoring a mapping drone i.e. I am looking up to keep the drone in sight  I noticed a black and white tumbling object at what appeared to be very high altitude (thousands of feet vs a small object closer to the ground) above the general area I was working in.  No visible exhaust or means of propulsion. The object did not appear to be traveling in a linear motion i.e. like a fixed wing aircraft but was maintaining position while it rotated on all axis changing from black to white i.e. one or more surfaces where white black. It appeared to have some flat surfaces almost like a cube. I looked away and could not relocate the object. Weather conditions were clear with bright sunshine and a wispy cloud layer at very high altitude.;38.65925;-90.4514
