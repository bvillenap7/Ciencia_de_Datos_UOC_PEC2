I closed the back of the van when I was finished and turned and looked up behind me. I saw one round light in the sky. I thought it was the moon at first behind the clouds but then it moved to the right and then the left never stoping again and then just got smaller as it took off to the left more. I thought it went around the back side of the house cause I lost site of it once it got past the roof of the carport. I stepped out and looked behind the house and saw nothing. I was just gone. I never saw it below the cloud line. I was telling my family that it was like someone shinning a flashlight down from the sky sort of like when you hold one under a sheet, I could see the outline of the clouds cause the light was behind it. Between the clouds it was brighter. I never heard a sound or anything. Creeped me out!!! All I know is I will never just blow someone off again when they tell me they have seen something strange in the sky or anywhere for that matter ever again.;36.8682;-94.3934
