brilliant star that hovered and moved while other stars remained stationery;2005-06-08 00:00:00;over an hour;brilliant star that hovered and moved while other stars remained stationery June 7th about 2300 my 17 year old daughter called me outside to look at a very bright star in the southwestern sky that hovered and moved. As it moved at times the light was behind the object and I could see that it appeared to be a sphere with light behind it. It stayed in close proximity to where we first saw it and it never moved very quickly but it definitely moved while other objects in the night sky remained stationery. We watched it for over an hour then went on to bed. The next night June 8th we looked for it beginning about 2130 and didn't see anything, we checked again at 2300 and it was back in pretty much the same location as the previous night. We called my parents age 70 and 71 who live next door and they were able to see it. My daughters boyfriend age 16 who lives one mile west of it was also able to see it. I have lived on the same property most of my life and my Mother has lived on the property for 71 years. We had not ever seen anything like this before.;36.8682;-94.3934
Rotating Sphere with a light in the middle on one area;2008-07-05 01:15:00;about 5 or 6 minutes;Rotating Sphere with a light in the middle on one area Note: I immediatly wrote down and drew a rough picture of what I saw, so I'm writing straight from the notebook what I put down after I ran inside and calmed down  The object was up in the southern sky, for a while I thought it was an unusually bright star until it began to rotate 360 degrees over and over. It remained in the same spot continuing to turn at a steady pace. I continued to watch in shock as an odd whooshing (it was not wind like sound) sound. I became afraid and stood up and the sphere stopped rotating to where the lit part was in full view to me. Suddenly I could see my own breath, as if the air was freezing, but it was 70 degrees outside.  After that I ran into the house, told my brother, got sick and then looked back out to where I had seen it, but it was gone. This was logged at 1:34 a.m. Central US time in my notebook. One thing I forgot to note was that when the light was completely out of my view I could see the full outline of the object from the light.;36.8682;-94.3934
