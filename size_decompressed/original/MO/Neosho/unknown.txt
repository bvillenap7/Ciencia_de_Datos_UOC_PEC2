I was with two friends about 10 o'clock at night and we saw what appeared to be the head lights of a car, except the lights were spaced out further than car head lights. It was moving very slowly towards us, so we pulled over next to a pasture to watch it. There was a tree line on the other side of the field, and whatever we saw moved in between us and the trees about 35 - 50 ft above the ground. The two lights became very bright and began to spin clockwise around each other. It seemed as if we could possibly see a silhouette of something behind the lights, but we could not tell what shape it was. After about 30 seconds of spinning they leveled off, dimmed and began moving slowly away in just about the same direction, and a few seconds later the lights just turned off or disappeared. The strangest part was that we never heard a single sound from whatever it was. I went to the the spot we that we saw it at 10 am the next morning, and there was nothing out of the ordinary, no crop circles or dead cows or any thing at all odd. of course, I had no testing equipment, so I don't know if there was any residual radiation or anything like that. I never really thought about reporting it or anything like that, until I recently saw a rerun of Unsolved Mysteries,and saw interviews with some people, including some police officers who had tracked something with a similar description moving across the midwest at about the same time frame. What did we see??? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));36.8682;-94.3934
