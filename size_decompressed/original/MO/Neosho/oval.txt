An addendum to my report made in December 2004 for the sighting on Dec. 13, 2004.;2004-12-13 22:00:00;20 seconds;An addendum to my report made in December 2004 for the sighting on Dec. 13, 2004. This is an addendum to my previous narrative.  One of the things that I noticed about the craft that I saw flying over Neosho, MO, but  failed to put in my initial report, was an area of distortion that followed the craft.  This distortion caused the stars to waver as if being seen through an intense heat.  This area of distortion of the stars is what made the craft easy to track as it moved from south to north across the sky.;36.8682;-94.3934
