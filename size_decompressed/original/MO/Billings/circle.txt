Its color was the same made by copper when exposed to a flame.  It was just north of northeast and was about the size of my little finger nail when held at arm's length. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon and travelled downward in a straight line at about a 45 degree angle.  It travelled rapikly and disappeared below the visible horizon.  I am 65 years old, hold two degrees and am a manager at a local utility.  My wife is 52, a house wife and retired nurse and speech pathologist and holds three undergraduate degrees and a master's degree.  Neither of us have ever seen any anomolous objects before.;37.0631;-93.5401
