shrinking lights;2006-07-25 22:50:00;2 minutes;shrinking lights I can't remember the exact date but it was in the summer of 2006 in Billings, MO. The front of my house faces directly south.  One evening at about 10:00pm I went out the front door to make sure my vehicle was locked when I immediately noticed a bright light in the sky. The light was as bright as Jupiter during opposition but with a more sharper / crisp detail. It was perfectly round.  Just a note I am an armature astronomer with an 11' Schmidt cassigrain telescope. So I am families with the night sky.  I immediately thought the light was not a normal occurrence. It was motionless. As I looked at it for a minute or so the light literally began to shrink until it totally disappeared. I'm thinking that was weird. I told my wife about it and to be honest, she didn't think too much about it. Then about a week later at about 10:30 at night I and my wife were outside smoking a cigarette on our deck. Our deck faces due north. When all of a sudden there is another light of the same magnitude to the north. My wife asked me what star or planet it was and I informed her it was neither. It was motionless just like the one earlier in the week and as bright. We watched it for a minute or so when the same thing happened again. It shrank and then disappeared. I never saw it again. I moved to Ozark, MO in the summer of 2007. Thank goodness the only thing Iâ€™ve seen there was an occasional satellite orbiting over. Do you have any explanation to as what me and my wife witnesses? By the way, both nights were clear. Please reply.;37.0631;-93.5401
