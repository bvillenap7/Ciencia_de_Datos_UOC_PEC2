Low object too low to be a star;2002-06-01 21:22:00;unkown;Low object too low to be a star I have been watching the past 3 days I've noticed a star like object to low to the earth about 10 miles to the west side towards I-44. I was always taught that the north star is always the brightest star, however this star is the brightest star I ever seen in the sky. I think it is a somekind of government spy contraption. It's not moving it stay about 2 hours to three hours I have noticed and disappears out of sight. Also this object is near the local airport here not too far from it . ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a planet.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
L-shaped and light-colored object(s) moving generally from NW to SE late at night.;2002-11-30 23:50:00;20 seconds;L-shaped and light-colored object(s) moving generally from NW to SE late at night. This object(s) moved across the clear night sky on a line from the Constellation Cassiopedia to the Constellation Orion. It had no lights but was apparently light colored and reflecting lights from the city. As best as I could tell it was L-shaped with the long arm parallel to the direction of motion. It also seemed to have a second short arm a short distance behind the leading short arm. It may have been a flock of light-colored birds but it seemed very rigid (no individual motion), rapid, and not a V-shape as I usually see during the day. I think it was silent but couldn't tell as a very busy street is only several houses away. It happened directly above my house.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
My son laid on our pick nick table and pointed above our apartment complex, and asked,What is that, is that a hot air balloon?  This i;2005-06-25 21:00:00;four minutes;My son laid on our pick nick table and pointed above our apartment complex, and asked,What is that, is that a hot air balloon?  This is the 9th UFO sighting up close and the first with my kids and girl friend.  My daughter saw it to.  My girl friend was inside.  I stood in one place until my girl friend came outside (she walked in just for a moment?  At first their was a circular black thing in the sky.  Then another came out of it and another.  The three black circles moved into one and then in two, back to one and it transformed back into three seperate black circles.  It then took a vertical flight into the sky and it seemed to disappear and reappear.  My kids where kind of freaked out and so was my girl friend.  I have never saw that kind of movement before.  Has any one else?;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Same craft as seen in Nijegen Holland, seen in Springfield, Mo. USA;2008-11-13 02:59:00;25 seconds;Same craft as seen in Nijegen Holland, seen in Springfield, Mo. USA I saw the same craft filmed in Nijmegen Holland shown on youtube. Same object 200 to 300 feet from ground, when first seen a white light was on for about 15 seconds. Light went out, I could then see same craft, same shape seen in Holland. Same I-beam construction and color of the Nijegen craft. Craft then proceeded north until I could not see it anymore. It was accompanied by a much smaller craft with no lights, but I could still see it very well. Both crafts appeared not to be afraid to be seen. I was the greatest thing I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
