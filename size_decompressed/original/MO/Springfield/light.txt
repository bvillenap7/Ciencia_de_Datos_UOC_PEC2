A faily bright green light appeared to be falling straight down at high speed. Dissapeared somewhere in the distance at ground level. T;1998-11-27 20:30:00;8 to 10 seconds;A faily bright green light appeared to be falling straight down at high speed. Dissapeared somewhere in the distance at ground level. There was no tail, no sound, and no other colors. Just green. I was East bound on a Springfield street named MtVernon when a rapidly moving light straight ahead above in the sky caught my attention. My first thought was a shooting star then I noticed the bright green color. I then thought that it was an aircraft that was going to crash because of it's rapid descent but the light was not flashing like on aircraft. It was on solid. As I followed it to the horizen I expected there to be a flash or explosion as it hit the ground but there was none. I can only guess as to where the location of where it came down at. It looked like somewhere near the center of the city or East of there. I have seen metiors and planes before, this was not either of those. It was very unusual. When it came into my field of view I would say it was somewhere between a thousand to five hundred feet up in the air. And it also did not look like any kind of fireworks either. It had weight and moved to fast for that. And there were no sparks. I can't add much more except perhaps to say that it was coming down so fast that it startled me. It appeared to go all the way to the ground whether it landed or crashed I don't know.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Star-like object traveling very quickly W-E low to horizon just north of Springfield then abruptly turned towards the north-northeast. ;1999-06-10 22:40:00;10 sec;Star-like object traveling very quickly W-E low to horizon just north of Springfield then abruptly turned towards the north-northeast. Sighting lasted 7-10 sec. My friend ((name deleted)) and I were on the north side of Springfield going back to my car. I was facing north when a star-like object caught my attention to the west just above the treeline moving extremely fast west to east.  I said That plane is moving pretty fast!  I decided that it wasn't a plane because there weren't any other lights on it. I realized that it must be far away because there wasn't any sound of a plane. After about four seconds the object started turning sharply to the north-northeast.  It continued in that direction and the light dimmed before being blocked by trees. Entire sighting lasted seven to ten seconds.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

We were at .80 Mach and G/S of 483knots.  Queried ATC about possible military target passing us, Memphis Center had nothing there. While flying at 33,000 feet on a commercial flight from LAX to CLT on Dec 26, the 2 pilot crewmembers and 2 flight attendants were observing an earth satellite passing overhead from the cockpit of a B757.  It was well past sunset at about 0100Z 27 Dec 1999. The earth satellite appararently flew into the terminator (it disappeared while high overhead).  Within a moment or so, a white lighted object overtook and passed us in fairly close proximity.  The object was first noted south of our west to east course at a distance estimated to be from about 2 to 5 miles.  It appeared to be at nearly the same or a slightly higher altitude.  The object showed only a bright white light that appeared to be slightly disturbed by turbulence, or very slightly pulsating.  It's course appeared constant as did its alititude.  It passed us and faded rather quickly from sight in a very brief amount of time, perhaps as long as forty seconds.  A query was made to Memphis Center ARRTC as to any possible traffic.  The controller said he had nothing on his scope that could be what we saw.  We saw nothing on our TCAS, set to observe other transponders within 4,000 feet of our altitude and within 20 miles of horizontal distance.  No red (left wing)position light and no fuselage red rotating beacons were sighted by any of the witnesses.  No magnetic or electrical disturbances on our aircraft occurred. At least one passenger noted the object pass by our craft from the passenger cabin.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  White ball of light over Springfield, MO moving south to north very quickly and low at 9:15pm.;2001-10-31 21:15:00;10 s;White ball of light over Springfield, MO moving south to north very quickly and low at 9:15pm. I had a sighting last night at 9:15pm Halloween night from my front yard.  It was a bright white ball of light traveling very quickly south to north over east Springfield, Missouri. It was very low about 30 degrees above horizon.  It was smaller than a pea at arm's length.  No strobing or flashing lights or aircraft sounds heard. This is the second time I've seen this light in a week.  Last Thurs. 10/25 at 10pm I was on my backyard deck and noticed this same white ball moving SW of Springfield but much lower and it quickly disappeared behind trees and homes.

Descending lights were observed by two groups of people within a single hour  and 100 miles apart.;2005-10-15 22:00:00;15 seconds;Descending lights were observed by two groups of people within a single hour  and 100 miles apart. My 13 year old son and I were entering the James River expressway on the north west side of Springfiel, MO, when I told him to look at the falling star showing in the front windshield of our car.  As he looked, I said that's not a falling star, what is it?   We both watched as a bright star-like light descended straight down from the sky, becoming larger and changing to a green (my view) or blue (my son's view) and then descended behind the tree line and out of our sight.   We continued watching the sky and I looking for anything to help explain what we had just seen.  It appeared to descend less than a mile from us.  Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the roads in that area as I wanted to try to find the landing area of the light that we had seen.  We told a few family members that night that we had just seen our first UFO. When I went to work on Monday morning, I decided to share this story with a work-friend.  As I started to tell her the story, her face changed and she said, Oh, go ahead.  Tell me your story    When I finished, she explained that while she was sitting outside on her farm near Liberal, MO, with her husband, sibling, and in-law on the same Saturday night, approximately 30-60 minutes after my son and I saw the light, she and her sibling and in-law witnessed a similar light that they initially thought was a falling star that descended straight down.  Their view was blocked by a shed as it approached the ground and did not see it change color or grow larger. We both found it fascinating that we both saw similar and unusual sights on the same evening approximately 100 miles from each other.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

My girlfriend and I were out on the back porch smoking when we observed two lights in the sky. They were apart from one another but one seemed to be following the other. They were moving in an upward fashion.  As they were going up the lights were getting harder to see and then they disappeared. The lights were very bright and they seemed to stay the same distance apart. It was nothing we had ever seen before.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Object was low to the ground, over residential area, with solid red and green lights, green light shut off when it began moving.;2010-07-07 23:45:00;2 Minutes;Object was low to the ground, over residential area, with solid red and green lights, green light shut off when it began moving. I was driving home from work and I looked up and I could see a solid red light with a solid green light in front of it.  I watched it for about 30 seconds and it seemed to be moving very slowly.  I saw the green light turn off and the red light came to a stop. I got close enough that I thought at first it must be a cell tower or something.  I got right next to it and it started moving quickly.  I turned into a parking lot to watch and rolled my window down so I could see a little better and it sounded like it was very low to the ground.  The sound coming from it was very similar to the sound a hair dryer would make but it was higher pitched. I know it wasn't a plane or a helicopter because it was too far from a hospital or airport to be so low.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Springfield,MO. A white light the size of a star moving at a high rate of speed!!;2012-05-16 22:00:00;30 seconds;Springfield,MO. A white light the size of a star moving at a high rate of speed!! I am 51yrs. old. I was facing south and the the object I saw was a white round light. It looked like a small star only it moved across the sky in a straight and seemed like a deliberate direction from the west in a ESE direction at a very high rate of speed. I have seen passenger aircraft and military jets at high altitude like the size of a star, day and night time with the blinking light or lights and they appear to crawl across the sky, when in fact they are also flying at high rates of speed. This object around 10:00PM-05/16/2012 did not blink it was a solid round white light and moved so fast. This is the second time in my life I have ever seen anyting move this fast in the sky. It looked and moved just like what I saw in the in the very early 70's when I was around the age of 11yrs old. Facing north, that object at first sight looked like a helicopter spotlight low in the sky then in a blink was the size of a tiny star moving from west to the ESE direc! tion at a very high rate of speed. At school the next day I told a friend Wallace what I saw I gave no detail because he responded Hey I saw the same before I could finish. I honestly did not believe him until that evening after school in the front yard of my house he pointed to the sky exactly where I saw the object, he moved his arm in a fast motion while pointing, like he was following the object in the same exact direction!  This on the night of 05/16/2012 was not an airplane, it was not my imagination nor was it a helicopter spotlight,shooting star ETC! I may be a skeptic to some degree but, I know what I saw was not normal!! I was in the navy starting in 1979 at Cecil Field Naval Airbase in Cecil Field FL. I never saw anything move as fast as what I saw on the night of may 16th 2012 and on that night in the 70's. My wife and I now live in the same house I grew up in. To sum this up On that night in the very early 70's I was facing the north I saw what looked like ! a helicopter spotlight and in a blink it was a white light the! size of a smaller star round in shape moving from west to a ESE direction at a very high rate of speed!! Present day on the night of 05/16/2012 around 10:00PM I was facing South and saw a white light in the West part of the sky the size of a small star, moving in a ESE direction at a very high rate of speed and was moving in a deliberate direction, not falling. It did not change direction and was visible to me only for about 15 seconds in the area visible to me because of trees.If this had been a normal aircraft like a military jet or even a passenger plane it would have taken at the very least a minute to pass the same exact distance.I take our trash out every night and look to the sky because I love the night sky and checking out the moon. I see aircraft all the time and know there is a major difference in what I see every night and what I saw the night of 05/16/2012 around 10:00PM and that night in the 70's.  Both events I saw in the sky ( 70's and present day) I saw from the sa! me house. I know of no aircraft that can move that fast when looking from the ground up to an altitude as high as these objects were! I know there are very fast jets...BUT NOT WHAT I SAW!!;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

We went outside to watch the meteor shower last night. After a few minutes we noticed a red light making circles and zig zags.  A glare would get brighter and dimmer.  At times it just looked like a small red light and other times it would have a full circle glare, then it looked similar to airplaine wings on the sides, then a tail like a comet.  It was fast moving and made a lot of small circles, hovered side to side, and made a lot of zig zags.  I have never seen a UFO and didn't truly believe in them until we saw it last night.  We got a little scared but it never did anything.  It disappeared after 20 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

They were flying west to east.  The first 6 formed a V and ascended into the sky until they could be seen no more. It was a clear night.

blue light(s) disappearing and reappearing in sporadic flight pattern;2013-05-15 23:45:00;15 minutes;blue light(s) disappearing and reappearing in sporadic flight pattern I was sitting on my back porch enjoying a beer when I looked out between the trees and saw what I initially thought was a shooting star, but realized it wasn't because it was overcast so there weren't any stars out and besides there is too much light pollution where I am to see stars.   So I quickly called my mom and step-dad out to witness it too.  It was a small blue orb-like light that appeared, streaked across the sky, then disappeared...and then appeared again.  It seemed to be flying around in circles, but in a sporadic flight pattern accelerating and decelerating and changing directions much faster than any modern military aircraft could do. It would appear, fly a looping, zig-zag pattern for a few seconds then disappear, only to appear again a few moments later.  It wasn't a spotlight because it was a little orb and I would have been able to see the beam of light.  There were possibly more than one because at one point my Mom saw two fly right by each other then split off in different directions, and I saw one with a red flashing light on it and then one without so there could have been multiple orbs.  It wasn't an airplane either because there wasn't a flashing white light and they flew very differently than a jet.  It seemed like there was only one, then more started popping up and then just like that they were gone.  Also, before they completely disappeared they seemed to be flying around at altitude then diving at the ground at steep angles and very rapid speeds, almost like a dive-bomber would.  I captured it on my iPhone but we were too far away and the camera is too poor I don't think you can see anything.  I first saw it around 2345 and they disappeared around 0000. It could have been going on before that but that is when I noticed it.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

It was getting dark, and I was outside talking with my neighbor he had just waxed his truck, and wanted to get it back in his garage because it looked like it was going to rain. Then to the East, I saw a light. I asked my neighbor if he knew if it was a star. It appeared to get brighter, and I was getting ready to hear what I thought would be the sound of a helicopter, but heard nothing. I would hear no sound of any aircraft throughout the sighting. It went behind a tree, I took my phone out of my pocket, and my neighbor asked if it was raining. A few seconds later, I started recording at exactly 7:37 PM. I assume it is the same light, due to the brightness. As I was recording, it also looked like there was something black over the light.  However, I could not see what that was clearly. The light appeared to head in a North direction, and soon started to disappear. This to me appeared to be from going through the clouds.  I was watching it through the screen of my phone, and camera app, so, when I couldn’t see it on screen, I looked over my phone, and I saw the light for about a second, and then I couldn’t see it anymore.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Were these stealth bombers or satellites or what the Hell were they?;2016-09-02 21:14:00;10-30 minutes;Were these stealth bombers or satellites or what the Hell were they? Headed home near the Springfield Airport, pulled into driveway, and my wife had remarked how it was so nice we could still see the sky here.  I glanced just for a second, and focused for a moment on what I thought was a constellation...  As my wife headed inside I noticed these were in fact objects (I believe to be aircraft flying at extremely high-altitude, perhaps satellites) flying at a slow pace in a triangular flight pattern with the lead object at a much lower altitude (brighter light). As I continued to focus on this area the objects maintained their slow pace & pattern.  I have seen some of the stealth bombers flying in formation out here, in broad daylight, but those were flying at a much lower altitude (and the emission trail was unbelievable!)... being familiar with star-gazing I wouldn't put it past it that these were satellites... but I have NEVER seen so many satellites flying in a formation pattern like aircraft, I would imagine if these were satellites, they'd be at a relatively lower orbit than the many times I've seen satellites 'skipping' along before. There were at least 6 in one formation, with another two groups that I could see of around 6 or so staggered at the same incredible altitude.

It was completely silent and moving fast.   I watched it as it disappeared to the north.  I must have been pretty high because I was able to watch it for about 2 minutes, before fading out completely.   Just as it vanished, my girlfriend said another one was coming.

On July 4, 2020, I had visited my parents home to celebrate independents day.  Around 9:30pm (21:30) I left to return home.  When I got to the intersection just below my parents house, I noticed a round flashing light in the sky. My first thought was an airplane, headed to the airport.  But then I noticed a second light at a distance behind the first one.  Our airport doesn’t receive airplanes that close together.  It’s a rather small airport with not much traffic. I grabbed my cell phone and snapped a quick picture.  I wanted to get out and watch it but a car pulled up behind me and so I turned and pulled to the side of the road. I stopped the car, and got out.  This is when I decided to film the lights.  I was a little shook up and fumbled around with my cell phone but I was able to get three short video clips.  In the last video, I panned from the light in the front to the light in the back and stayed with that second light until it disappeared. The light was red and yellow like fire and flashed in pulses.  (All caught in video!) then it just dissolved into the sky.  After the event,I reviewed the still picture I took and noticed a third set of lights above the other two with very faint lights in two rows, exactly parallel to each other.  These lights were NOT visible to me with my naked eye and only appear in the photo.  I also zoomed in on the initial ball of light and could see it wasn’t completely round.  There was a “stem” of light on the front. The event lasted for several minutes.  Much longer than any pyrotechnics would;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
