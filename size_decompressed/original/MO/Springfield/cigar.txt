grey, dull, metallic looking Cigar craft;2000-10-28 00:00:00;9 min.;grey, dull, metallic looking Cigar craft I was working at 1701 S Campbell, and came out for a cigarette.  Spotted a dull grey metallic Zeppelin looking thing out to the North a ways.  Moved steadily to the east. Was also seen by volunteer and we couldn't figure out what it was.pe;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Object entering atmosphere with fire trail, followed by three brightly pulsing objects;2008-05-29 20:20:00;5 minutes;Object entering atmosphere with fire trail, followed by three brightly pulsing objects At 8:20pm, not quite dusk, I and three friends witnessed an object crossing the sky, from northeast to southwest, leaving a fire trail as if it were entering the atmosphere.  As it reached the halfway point along our horizon, two flat objects came into view, as if chasing it.  These two were followed shortly by a third. The chasing objects slowly pulsed with a very bright light, taking maybe 5 seconds to cycle from dim to bright to dim again.  The entire group had crossed our sky and passed over the horizon within 5-10 minutes.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
8 crafts seen over springfield missouri.;2012-12-12 00:00:00;15 minutes;8 crafts seen over springfield missouri On my way to work I was driving down highway 65 heading south into Springfield when I first noticed 2 odd elongated ships that seemed to have some kind of maybe fire (?) coming from the end of them such as you see in rockets.  They caught my attention due to the fact they seemed engaged in some flight patterns that didn't make sense, they were heading directly toward one another but never collided.   Then I noticed the other crafts that were identical at other points in the sky, all very close together and not displaying any typical aircraft lighting.  They seemed to be hovering more than anything but I could see something like fire coming from the end of them.   As I drove on all but 3 of them vanished and the 3 that were left formed almost a triangle formation of sorts in the sky, eventually 2 vanished and left 1 which appeared to be closer now and the fire I saw coming from the end of it now looked pink in color. I have never seen anything like this in our skies before.  Also I would like to note that about 30 minutes later as I was sitting at an intersection the sky in front of me was daylight as it should be and when I looked to my right the sky there was in pitch darkness, I was very confused as to how it can be daylight yet dark so close together, I snapped photos of the daylight/darkness part with my cellular phone to show other people to see if anyone could explain it.   All of this is very strange and I dont know what to make of it, I came here after finding it on google hoping perhaps someone else had seen these things and reported them also.
