Circular unidentified object directly above our apartment complex;2005-06-25 19:00:00;5-10 minutes;Circular unidentified object directly above our apartment complex It was around 8pm on Saturday night.  My boyfriend, his two children, and I were outside of our apartments talking and having fun.  My boyfriends son layed down on a picnic table and looked up in the sky and said Daddy what is that?  Greg then calls to me to come outside, because I had gone in to grab a drink.  I come back out and look up and see what looks like 3 black circles directly over our apartment.  It was hovering pretty close and then it started to move up and off to the southeast of us.  As it was moving it changed from one circle into what looked like 2 circles and then into one.  We watched it until it disappeared into the sky.  I've never seen anything like it before, nor has my boyfriend or his children.  It did not have any lights on it nor did it make any sound.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Orange and yellow objects that turned to flat black cylindrical shapes;2012-10-08 19:00:00;10 minutes;Oranga and yellow objects that turned to flat black cylindrical shapes Looking North West from my house toward the sunset me and my wife noticed five lights that looked like illuminated clouds only very small and round.  The color being a orange aura with a yellow center that made us think it was the sun reflecting off of clouds in the distance even though there were no others at the time.  The objects seemed to be moving in a horizontal fashion very slowly.  This went on for about two to three minutes until 3 of the objects faded to nothing while the other two faded to what appeared to be flat almost cylindrical black shapes with no aura.  These seemed to stay right in place until they started to move back towards the horizon and out of sight.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
