Clear sky.  2 section, rectangular, 3 dimensional, silver, low-flying object, approx. semi trailer size.;2016-01-29 14:10:00;10 minutes;Clear sky.  2 section, rectangular, 3 dimensional, silver, low-flying object, approx. semi trailer size. Sunny, clear, blue sky.  At approximately 2:00 PM, I was driving north on 65 highway and saw a silver shape in the sky ahead of me, to my northwest moving east.  I got closer to it and identified the shape as rectangular proportions similar to a semi trailer or possibly slightly longer.  It was traveling slower than a helicopter and slightly higher than helicopters usually fly.  It was pretty low. The craft was sharp and clear.  Size, thumb at arm’s length would probably cover the height but not the length.  It seemed to have two sections.  The back section was the same height but only about ¼ or &#8531 the length of the leading section.  The sections were slightly separated although there was some sort of narrow bar between the sections connecting them. The rectangle was a burnished silver color.  The bottom was darker, I suppose because the sun was not shining directly on it.  Between the two sections it was much brighter except for the bar.  It either had a light source or perhaps it was the angle of the sun. I don’t know.  There were disruptions in the texture along the side of the front section.  They were indistinct.  They didn't look like windows but there was something different along the side in four or five noticeable areas. I took the sunshine street exit and while stopped at the traffic light at the bottom of the ramp, the object crossed my path about a quarter mile in front of me.  Nobody else seemed to see it and I was trying to catch another driver's eye to look up but I was unsuccessful.  I wanted to take a photo but there was no place to pull over so I decided to follow it by turning east on Sunshine.  I followed for about 3 miles impeded by traffic.  It was travelling in an ESE direction.  Sunshine goes directly east.  Soon I was looking at the back of it and it was pulling away from me.  There was traffic and no place to pull over until it was nothing but a silver spec in the sky.  It looked like it would cross hwy 60 just south of Rogersville.   At that point I was able to pull over.  I got out of the car and could no longer see anything of the object.  I immediately called my husband at 2:18 pm, and told him what I had seen.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

UFO spotted after military aircraft flew by.;2018-08-28 09:30:00;20 seconds;UFO spotted after military aircraft flew by. I was sitting in my car with the sunroof opened up at a local business.  I heard an approaching helicopter flying over.  The helicopter was a military style helicopter.  The helicopter was flying around 3000 feet, headed in a southeast direction. As soon as the helicopter flew past, I noticed what appeared to be a shiny rectangle like object in a near stationary position.  The object resembled a jetliner's fuselage minus the wings and tail section.  The UFO appeared to be about 15,000 to 20,000 feet high.   The object looked silverish and white in appearance with a light bluish light on the right side of object that was facing east. The object was only moving slightly to the east at maybe around 5 MPH.  After observing the UFO for around 20 seconds, it darted out of view heading northeast.  I do not know the speed, but guessing I would say it was doing mach 1, or faster.  The UFO made no noticeable sound when it was moving slowly and when it flew away at a sudden speed. Side note:  At the time the weather was calm, around 80 degrees fahrenheit with a few scattered high clouds.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
