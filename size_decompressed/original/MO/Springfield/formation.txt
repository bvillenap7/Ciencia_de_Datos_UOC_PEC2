3 light's clustered together north of I-44 from the Industrial Park on Kearny;2009-01-18 05:15:00;over 15 minutes;3 light's clustered together north of I-44 from the Industrial Park on Kearny At approximately 5:15 am Sunday Jan 18, 2009 I was in a parking lot in the industrial park  on East Kearny in Springfield, MO. Looking north across I-44 I saw 3 square lights close together and approximately 20 stories in the air. They made no sound and the object appeared to be rotating extremely slow. I watched it for at least 15 minutes and it remained stable. I called the local news station and was told that there arenâ€™t any towers in that direction and they did not know what it could be.

At 5:30 a.m on September 5th 2012, I was laying in my bed getting ready to set the alarm on my phone and go to sleep.  The bedroom is in the front corner of my house and faces West.  There are windows at the head (west) and my side (south) of the bed.  As I pull up the alarm app on my phone it freezes and shuts off.  I looked out of the window next to me when bright lights and an object that at first appeared to be a helicopter caught my attention traveling from the East no more than 100 ft above my neighbors house.  It appeared to be moving very slowly and had too many lights to be the type of helicopter that my town utilizes.   I promptly jumped out of bed and ran out my front door to get a better look.  The first thing that made me uncomfortable was the dead silence. The aircraft made no sounds and continued traveling West.  It moved in a strange way around the trees and then appeared to sink lower suddenly over the highway 5 blocks down.  I waited to see if it wou! ld climb higher but it just vanished.
