MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  Oval craft with two sets of dual blinking white lights over Springfield, MO.;2000-08-01 21:25:00;<10 sec.;Oval craft with two sets of dual blinking white lights over Springfield, MO vanished overhead. Oval craft with two sets of dual blinking white lights on each side was seen passing overhead just west of the star Vega.  The craft was traveling slowly east to west when suddenly it just blinked out after watching it for less than 10 seconds.  I was unsure whether it moved away quickly to the north after the lights disappeared.  The weather was clear and warm.  No aircraft sound was heard.  This object was not in the regular flight path of the commercial jets along following I-44 to the north of my home in SW Springfield. *Peter, I'm a UFO investigator for Ozarks Area UFO Research Group (OARG) and you have permission to use my email address ( ufosource@email.com ) for other possible witnesses.

Two Brightly lit craft observed  around Springfield Missouri.;2007-09-12 04:00:00;45 minutes;Two Brightly lit craft observed  around Springfield Missouri. At 04:00 hours an oval object appeared to the northeast of Springfield mo. It had what appeared to be an oval shape and had strobe lights that changed from red, green, blue, and white. While sitting in the same spot for the first fifteen minutes, from the edges of the craft it emitted round bright white balls of light. These balls would come out of the craft horizontally then disappear altogether. This happened a total of four times then no more came out.  I called a friend to confirm what I was seeing, and she saw another one to the south of Springfield. Oval in shape but turned upright. With the same colored strobes as the one above. No balls of light came from the second craft.  To ensure it was not moving I placed a couple of pieces of tape on the glass surrounding the object and watched from the same location. The stars were of course slowly dropping below the tape line but not this object.  The one to the south of Springfield had a bright flash that was produced several times from the craft. Similar to a camera flash at night.  We watched both objects from 04:00 hours until they went dark suddenly at around 04:47. We could not figure out if they left or just went dark and remained in the same location.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Bright orange oval object over Springfield Missouri;2012-05-16 16:45:00;3 mins;Bright orange oval object over Springfield Missouri My neighbor and I were sitting on his patio talking.  I had just seen a falling star to the South and spoke about bringing my telescope out.  In the East sky appeared an oval bright orange light that moved across the sky slowly.  This object had a haze around it and had no red or green lights on it.  It was not real high in the night sky as it passed. I walked on to the lawn to get a better look and it moved across headed West.  I watched and as quickly as it appeared it was gone.  It made no sound what so ever and was not any Air craft I have ever seen.  I watch the Night sky every night and have never seen any thing like this in my life. Their was no moon out and the sky was clear. I have seen and been witness to U F O's in Gulf Breeze Fl, but they were not orange.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
