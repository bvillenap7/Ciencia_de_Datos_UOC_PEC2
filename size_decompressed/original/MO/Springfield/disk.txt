Medium sized black disk with circular lights underneath.;1987-06-11 20:00:00;3 minutes;Medium sized black disk with circular lights underneath. I was 10 years old in 1987 living in Springfield Mo.  It was a Sunday evening in June around 8pm.  I was sent to my room to go to bed but I thought it was to early to lay down since it was still so bright out.  So I opened up my blinds and began looking around outside.  At first there's nothing to exciting to look at because its woodsy all round but then as I'm laying my head sideways on my folded arms in the window...I noticed in the corner of my vision a medium sized, round very dark disk with 8 to 12 circular lights underneath slowly spinning clockwise, quiet and smooth, passing over my house.  It was so slow that I could see the lights themselves clearly.  They looked like canister lighting in kitchens, a warm yellow color that was not hurtful to look at straight on.  The underbelly was beyond black and flat. No shine no reflections. I watched for as long as I could before it was out of range . Then I ran out of my room in a flash to tell my dad. I said I saw this round flying thing that was so low to the house and all the details I mentioned. He just shook me off and said it was a helicopter or something. But I can honestly say that I saw a UFO ship. Nothing has ever looked like that during the 80s and I still see it so clearly to this day in my memory. It was real.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
UFO flew over Spg. MO near Glenstone and Grand on the very night of the Lunar Eclipse and Hale-Bopp.;1997-03-27 20:40:00;60 - 90 secs.;UFO flew over Spg. MO near Glenstone and Grand on the very night of the Lunar Eclipse and Hale-Bopp. On the very night of the Lunar Eclipse, while Hale-Bopp was still in the sky, we were cooking outside and watching the sky because the Eclipse was getting ready to take place. I had the urge to look up into the south sky (opposite direction from the comet) and saw what to the best of my recollection was either the front of a disc or a large batman type of wing floating overhead. I called loudly to my husband to come out and witness this, as I knew he would not believe me. He came out just in time to see the craft go over the house to the north. It was above the streetlight and it appeared to be round. While it was overhead, it was not visible, as though looking only at the sky. It could only be seen on the cusps of the craft. It flew off and curved right away to the northwest after passing over our home. I watched the news that night hoping others may have seen this, but there were no reports of it. My husband at the time was teaching at a local college. The next day he asked if anyone had seen anything odd the night before, whereupon one did tell that he and his girlfriend also saw something similar in the sky the prior evening, while watching for the eclipse. The thing that was confusing to me was that, in my mind, an object that appeared that size would fall out of the sky, were it flying so smoothly and at such a low speed. It seemed to be on cruise at a low speed. The only other solution to this speed is that it could have been much larger and much higher, appearing smaller and closer. However, we could see the streetlight in front of our house reflecting onto the back of the cusp or disc as it flew off. I have tried to do a search on the internet to see if others spotted this ufo during the Eclipse and Hale-Bopp, however, the only other thing I have found was references to Heaven's Gate. I/we were never in the slightest interested in cults. I have thought of this many times and hoped others had seen the ufo on that very night and also wondered if they, whoever they are, intentional! ly flew the craft that very night because they knew people would be watching the eclipse that night. Was it some kind of a test to see if people would report it?;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

As soon as I get out of town I notice a bright light hovering to the northwest. It was very large and bright white, with a red light in the middle. The craft had a glowing ring around the outside of it. I pulled off the road and a cop came up behind me and said ‘no your not crazy, I see it too.’’;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Green Glowing Saucer Shaped;2009-11-03 00:11:00;2 seconds;Green Glowing Saucer Shaped I saw a green oval shaped object that was moving in a diagonal downward direction at a slow speed.  The object seemed to glow green, and it moved diagonally downward for about 3 seconds before disappearing in the sky.

fireball and gray disc with revolving red light;2010-07-09 21:45:00;5 minutes;fireball and gray disc with revolving red light We were on the way home from Wal mart when my girlfriend is like, What is that?  after we turn onto the street we live on. I look out the window to the left and there is a large orange fireball in the northern sky heading east.   We continue driving home while watching it.When we pull into the drive way and get out the fireball dissipated and there was a large glowing orange disk in its place.  It faded to gray as if it was cooling down and turned and started heading south directly over our house.  As it silently passed over head we could see an red light near the perimeter of the disk until it disappeared over the horizon.   The thing was obviously spinning cause you could see the one red light going around.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

Saucer seen by the Walgreens on West Keraney Street;2017-03-27 21:45:00;~50 seconds;Saucer seen By the Walgreens on West Keraney Street I saw the craft behind the hobby Lobby across the street from my Walgreens.  I was out taking a smoke break when I actually saw it.  The craft flew very fast and at first I thought it was just an Airplane, but then, it stopped dead in its tracks and hovered for several seconds.  It had red and green lights that flashed.  I tried to make out the shape and i'm almost certain it was a saucer.  But I could be wrong.   	I stared for a while, then quickly ran back into the store to try and get my manager, but by the time I went back out with her, the craft was gone.  This isn't the first craft I've seen in this area, I'd say in the last couple months, I've seen three in the same general area, reacting about the same.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
