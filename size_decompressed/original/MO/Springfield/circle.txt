Very close and very vivid;1974-06-30 09:30:00;20 min;Very close and very vivid My Son Daughter and myself was at the Springfield Drive in Theater. The object appeared above the screen of the Theater and set there like they were maybe just checking it out. It was round and smaller at the bottom with a red light on it. The center revolved and had a number of windows in it with light coming through the windows. like standing outside a house at night and looking in but seeing nothing but the light. As the center revolved on one side was several smaller windows and on the other side was longer windows, There was no noise coming from the thing. My daughter started crying wondering if it was the end of the world.It hovered for awhile and then just took off real fast. It was gone a few minutes then reappeared, it didn't stay long the second time, it hovered a few minutes then shot off in the very same diection that it had gone the first time. I asked the people in the car next to me if they were seeing what I was and the man said he didn't have any idea what we were all seein. We left the theater right after that along with most of the other cars. I went to my sisters and called the City Police dept. they said they had  numerous reports. The next day I called the police back to see if they had anymore info on it, and they told me they had not received any repoets the night before. I cannot tell you forsure the time or the year for sure I do know it was in the summer time and between the years between 1972 and 1977. Because I know where we were living in this paticular house between those years and we were living there when we saw it.My daughter has passeed away but she remembered it quit accurately untill that time. My son is now 42 years old and he and I still have the very same memory.We don't talk about it much because people think we are nuts.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

round dull metal efo covered in piping on the bottom;1994-06-01 14:00:00;2 mins;round dull metal efo covered in piping on the bottom When I was about 9, I was home alone my parents just left with my brother and sister. I was sitting on my couch when I heard a loud scraping noise on my roof, although it did not sound scary, sounded like it could just be something logical like a huge tree branch. When I drew the curtains back, just about my house was a giant circle shaped ufo, a dull metallic tin foil color. The bottom was all I could see, it was covered in piping. It was so big, so close, no more than 20 feet above my home, as it passed- another one fallowed. No one seen this but me, I called my friend who live a few blocks up and she had no idea what I was talking about. No one was outside, no one heard it, it was almost like it was only meant for me to see it. Like it camouflaged itâ€™s self to everyone in the world but me. When my parents got home I tried to tell them, I grabbed 2 paper plates placed them together, covered them with tin foil and tried to draw the piping.

We thought we saw a plane, but then realized the craft was still and blinking red and blue.  It was a circular shape and sat for a good 5 seconds but then shot up super fast and  disappeared   In the trees.  We sat and looked at each other for a minute a freak end and went inside it was freaky.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
