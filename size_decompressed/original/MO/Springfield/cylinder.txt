It also hovered and then went forward very slowly. At 14:00 on November 16th, my wife and I were going west on James River Expressway just past Glenstone Boulervard in Springfield, Missouri when to the north, at a distance of less than 1/4 od a mile, we observed an unidentified flying object at less than 1000 feet in altitude that was hovering. It was a cylinder shape, with no lights. The best way to expalain it is a jet airliner fuselage with no wings, no windows, no tail and no visible means of propulsion.We pulled off of the shoulder and other cars slowed down to see the event. It hovered for three minutes, then went slowly to the east at approximately 100 miles an hour. It made no sound,and had no contrails. After about four minutes, it sped up and then vanished out of sight. The day was perfectly clear.20 minutes later, going south on 160, we observed 4 fighter jets in loose formation going northeast toward Springfield. They appeared to be F4 Phantom jets, perhaps from Little Rock Air Force Base or maybe a base out of Oklahoma.I don't know if these jets are related to the first event. I know one thing, my wife is buying me a camcorder for Christmas to carry in the car after this event.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Crashed large cylindrical object in a neighbors yard. Lit up extremely brightly and vanished without a trace.  ((anonymous report));2019-10-06 22:00:00;5 minutes;Crashed large cylindrical object in a neighbors yard. Lit up extremely brightly and vanished without a trace. My dogs started barking and out of the blue, my power went out after a loud explosive noise.  I walked out to my garage to check my breaker box but found nothing.  When I walked outside to see if any other houses had the problem I saw the object two houses down.  The object was very metallic but not in a normal way,  Almost like a black silver or a locked phone screen.  It was about 8 feet long and around the circumference of two adult oak trees.  It looked as if it had crashed in front of my neighbor's house who came out with her husband along with me.  The object after about 4 minutes after we looked at it changed its deep black color to a very painfully bright white light before vanishing without any marks on the ground or any debris anywhere.  When I walked back inside my dogs we're barking at my front door and my power was on.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
