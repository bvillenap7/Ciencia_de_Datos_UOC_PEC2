never moving orb;2002-06-12 14:30:00;8 min;never moving orb well let me start by saying. what i saw is just a ufo i dont claim it to be a ship or craft.while flying kites at springfield lake i saw a huge orb looking ball way up in the sky. i know it was way up there because as we looked at it high level clouds passed by covering it and after they passed it was still there. we layed on the groun d and had a ciggerete talking about it  and layed there for 3-4 min after that . it never moved, never got bigger or smaller so doubt it was a balloon even a balloon will get smaller to the eye in 8 min of floating. clouds again moved in an covered it and passed but this time it was gone. just thought youd like to add it to your many storys.

Yellow Orb;2010-04-05 23:10:00;7 seconds;Was letting my dog out before going to bed.  I opened the screen door to let her in and I see a yellow orb floating in front of me.  It quickly moved to my right, over our privacy fence to the side of the house and out of sight.  It appeared about 6-7 feet off the ground, just over head height.
