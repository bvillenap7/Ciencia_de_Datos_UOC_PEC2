Two strobing white lights very close in the sky, followed by a low flying red fireball at approximately a 20% angle;1999-11-05 21:35:00;4 minutes;Two strobing white lights very close in the sky, followed by a low flying red fireball at approximately a 20% angle At 21:35 Friday night November 5th the sky was extremely clear and I was finishing burning leaves and old limbs. I saw two blinking white strobe like objects in the south sky, extremely close together. ASNd they appeared stationary. It startled me because I did not think aircraft could get that close and also there were no blinking colored lights. Four minutes later, an extremely bright red fireball, descended at a very low altitude of 5000 feet or less, at a 20 degree angle in the vicinity of the blimnking strobes. The fireball went from west to east and disappeared behind some trees. Then the two strobe like objects departed each other, one going to the east and one to the west.Then at 21:55, three aircraft with blinking green lights started circling the area where I lost sight of the fireball. They circled around about 12 minutes and then departed the area, going north toward Springfield. After the fire ball incident, I also emailed the meteorologist of a local TV station to see if there were any reports of any fireballs.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Green fireball over Springfield,MO;2000-12-11 21:15:00;15 seconds;Green fireball over Springfield,MO Mom and I were visiting a family member at the hospital. As we were leaving the parking lot I saw a bright green light flash on my right ( North). The light fell towards the west and vanished below the tree line. I asked Mom if she saw that, and she said yes, she had never seen a green shooting star before. I told Mom I wasn't sure it was a shooting star. We talked about the location of the airport and the speed of what we had seen. I also told Mom I had seen a similar object some days before. I don't know what we saw that night, but I know it wasn't natural.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

Facing East at 7:50 CDT, I saw a fireball at about 45 degrees going from the south directly north and disappeared over the horizen, the fireball actually was tinted green.  It only took two seconds, but was larger than venus at its brightest.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
bright green triangular object throwing sparks traveling extremely fast;2002-10-11 06:17:00;6 seconds;bright green triangular object throwing sparks traveling extremely fast This event was probably space junk burning up in the atmosphere, but the intensity of the light, color, and speed of object were extraordinary.  A shape was discernable. It was roughly an acute triangle with points of greater brightness.  Color was bright green with gold overtones.  Sparks were flying off the thing tangential to direction of movement.  It traveled roughly from an 11:00 position to almost the horizon in a north-northeasterly direction. Color of sparks ranged from gold to dark red.  It looked like it had a plasma surrounding it.  Size: about 16 millimeters in length and about 4 or 5 millimeters in width at the widest as observed by the naked eye.  There was also some structure evident in the shape itself with some longitudinal lines of brightness, almost a gold red, running through the basic shape.  It was quite striking.  I observed it from the driver's seat of my vehicle and was startled enough to come to a complete stop and contemplate what I had just seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.  PD));37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
UFO orbs appear during intense MCV thunderstorm;2009-05-08 09:48:00;5 or 6 seconds;UFO orbs appear during intense MCV thunderstorm I'm senior in college at Missouri State University.  I was sleeping in because it was dead day, Friday May 8, which is always study day the Friday before finals.  I was woken up by tornado sirens and a really terrible thunderstorm at 9am.  The power was also out.  We get really bad thunderstorms but this one took the cake.  From www.weather.com/newscenter/stormwatch/:  MCV becomes - Inland Hurricane:  May 8, 2009 brought a derecho, a widespread windstorm associated with a bow echo thunderstorm complex, along a 600-mile-long, 60-mile wide swath across southeast KS, south MO, and south IL. Many of the damaging winds were not with the leading line of severe thunderstorm, but rather behind it and beneath a mid-level rotation center called an MCV - mesoscale convective vortex. Winds gusted to 106 mph. At least 220,000 customers lost power in MO and IL. The system spawned more than 30 tornadoes, at 20 of them in southwest MO. EF3 tornadoes hit Howell County MO and Garrard County KY.  This storm was crazy.  It was pounding my off campus apartment.  I could hear pieces of metal siding being ripped off the building.  It was the weirdest thing...the winds were blowing straight at the building, driving the rain around the edges of the sliding glass door and spraying my living room with water.  I was freaking out.  It was very intense, and I was frantically trying to figure out how to keep the water out.  The winds began to calm down a bit, and I was running around my apartment trying to find the memory card to my camera.  I'm a sort of an amateur meteorologist and love taking storm photos.  I'm a photography and graphic design major, and I have a Canon 40d with a number of lenses, including a solid zoom 100-400mm L.  However, I couldn't find my 16gb memory card and nearly ripped my apartment apart trying to find it.  I couldn't even find my backup 4gb card, which was odd, because its always in my bag.  After several minutes of frantic searching, I stopped for some reason, in my living room, turned to my right, and out the back sliding glass door window was the weirdest sight.  It was like an orb shaped thing, combined with a fireball, perhaps a few miles in the distance hovering beyond the middle school behind my apartment.  It was really weird because it seemed to be wiggly...like it had waves coming off of it that were vibrating.  It was bright white, and the edges seemed to be yellowish orange.  The first thing I thought was that something exploded in mid air, and this is where my memory is a little fuzzy because I'm reporting this many months later (which I'll explain soon).  I'm pretty sure that another one appeared on the sides of it, which made me think it was an aircraft.  Sometimes aircraft fly under thunderstorms to avoid the dangerous updrafts.  But the way the lights radiated was just too weird.  Then they each disappeared, one by one, quickly.  What ticked me ! off the most was that even though I had my camera around my neck, I couldn't take a photo!  Gaaahh!  Ridiculous.  So I grab my iPhone, text my fiance and roommate to tell them what happened, and then looked up Springfield's airport website to find arrival / departure times.  There were no planes landing near the time that I saw the lights, and Springfield, being a small town of 150k, it doesn't get many large aircraft landing during the day.  Also the lights didn't seem to be moving in any direction, and if they were coming head on, that wouldn't make any sense either, because the airport is on the NE fringe of town and I was right in the middle of town, and even though its a small town, its spread out over 88 square miles because they don't know how to build up in these small towns.  The other explanation would be ball lightning, which hasn't been scientifically proven to exist, but has been observed by many people in the past.  So here is some background info on why I'm posting this so far after the fact: tonight I was watching UFO Hunters on the History channel and they showed these orbs on there that have been occuring in the Ozarks around Springfield this year and some of the video and artist's renditions looked a lot like what I saw and it freaked me out.  I didn't get the same feeling of dread when I saw it that other people have reported, but I did feel like I was frozen and couldn't move.  It was pretty wild.  They also reported about a light on the north side of town, and I also believe I have seen this light before when driving back in forth to Bolivar, MO to see my friends at SBU.  It just seems too bright and out of place for that area of the sky and I only notice it sometimes.  I feel like I have a fairly solid grasp of astronomy, having taken a college course where we had to learn about heavenly objects and went out to Baker Observatory (which ironically is near Marshfield, where on UF! O hunters a highway patrolman reported an orb following him) on several occasions to observe the night sky.  My dad was also an amateur astronomer when I was younger and we would go outside and look at the stars frequently.  I'm also not a crazy UFO person, but a fairly rational college student.  However, I feel like I have some sort of odd connection with UFOs.  When I was in elementary school I would have horrible horrible night terrors of being abducted by aliens and when I was in 10th grade, I had another encounter I'd like to share.  Feel free to remove this for the reporting post but I want to submit it along with this for completeness:  My best friend and I were driving home late on a Thursday night from the movies near midnight, which was my curfew in 10th grade.  My best friend is very smart, an Eagle Scout and a member of the Stretch program at school for highly intelligent students.  We were both in advanced placement programs for math and literature.   Since it was so long ago (2001-2002?) I can't remember the date at all. We were waiting at a red light at 7hwy and 40hwy in Blue Springs, MO, a suburb of Kansas City.  We saw three orb lights, in a triangle formation, float over the HyVee grocery store, turn while crossing 40hwy, and then float over the WalMart.  Then they suddenly zoomed off at incredibly high speed in the direction of my house.  The way they moved made us feel like they were attached.  Both of us saw the lights and were a bit freaked out.  That's when things started to get really crazy.  As we continued down 40 hwy and the other two roads [road names REDACTED, since it's near my parent! s house], nearly every single street light we passed by suddenly went out.  It was making us very scared, especially since we were in a convertible.  My friend pulled into the circle drive I lived on, and dropped me off at the bottom of the driveway.  Before getting out, I noted that it was 11:55pm, before curfew, since I was worried about getting back in time.  When I got inside, my dad half-joked that I was late (it wasn't a serious violation) and I said What are you talking about?  I looked at the time and it was 12:05am.  I was so confused.  How did it take me 10 minutes to walk inside?  I went straight inside.  So I talked to my friend the next day and he told me something pretty interesting (and scary).  Apparently when he was at the stop sign to leave my circle drive, he saw a bright flash in his rear view mirror.  He turns around, and he said he couldn't see me anywhere.  He then drove away quickly, which at the time ticked me off that he just left me like that.  ! That about freaked the hell out of me.  I've only told these stories to a few people, but figured that I might as well come forward now.  I bet there are a lot of normal people out there, like me, who would never google UFO reports and actually type up something like this and send it in because they would think that they must be crazy.  But I am starting to think that there is something to this whole UFO thing and that if I didn't share this, then I wouldn't be helping anyone figure out what's going on.  I also got my accurate times for the first report from the messaging app on my iPhone.  I sent the text to my fiance right after the event (and I also sent her one right after I awoke to tornado sirens, she lived in the Kansas City area at the time) and it was logged in the app.  Honestly, I have no idea what's going on, but its starting to freak me out a bit that stuff that I've seen is showing up on TV in the town I live in when I thought that there must be a rational explanation.  I just can't get my mind aroun! d the idea that there are aliens flying around the earth.  It just doesn't seem possible.  I just thought that was something to be scared of as a child, like monsters or the boogie man.  If it's proven that aliens are real, then it's going to be really hard for me to deal with that.  It just doesn't make sense!  Why would they even appear like this or take people?  What is the motive?  Are they bored?  Why not just come down and show themselves?  Are they just having fun with us?  It is so weird that other people have seen something similar to what I saw.  It is even more weird that there have been enough people seeing things that a UFO tv show came to this town to interview people.  I wish they would go away because now I'm fearful of their presence and my possible connection to them.  Also my mom told me a couple years ago that my grandpa used to see ufos, strage lights, and would awake in the middle of the night, at the window, sleepwalking, talking to them outside the w! indow.  My mom saw a ufo with them when she was younger, hover! ing over a car in a parking lot late one night.  That was probably sometime in the late 70s early 80s.  Is there something about my family that attracts them?  Or is it a coincidence?  Sorry for the rambling, I've got a huge project due in the morning and it's getting late!  Time to get back to work...feel free to edit this to make it more cohesive for online consumption.  Thanks for your time.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
2 Orange fireballs in the night sky while fire works are going off around it.;2012-07-04 16:55:00;15 minutes;2 Orange fireballs in the night sky while fire works are going off around it. I was sitting in my drive way watching the fire works going off.  I had looked over and saw some thing that looked like an ember floating and pointed it to my neighbor.  We stood and looked and it got larger and brighter.  It was coming from the South headed North.  As we watched it turned East and we watched as it got in the distance and faded away.  It was about as high as the tree tops and we saw no sign of any lights that would mark a plane or helecopter.  It made no noise at all. My neighbor went in and I moved to my back yard to watch and again I saw a fire ball of Orange color following the same patn.  I ran and knocked on my other neighbors door and he came out to see. It was very much like what we had seen several months.  AMAZING.  I went and got my telescope and sat for a bit watching and nothing.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

Red/orange aircraft on fire like appearance;2013-07-27 00:00:00;5 minutes;Red/orange aircraft on fire like appearance From my backyard between Mercy Hospital and Battlefield Mall I observed what I at first thought to be a helicopter traveling south from Mercy Hospital, but noticed no sound.  It appeared that the whole interior was brightly lite in orange/red, so I thought one of the rescue helicopters was on fire.  I ran through the house yelling for my husband to follow me to the front yard to watch it pass, saying I think a helicopter is on fire.  We both stood in the front yard unable to identify what we were seeing.  We watch the sky a lot so we know most of the aircraft that pass this way.  This craft proceeded to silently travel south and turned east just past the Battlefield Mall.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

Large ball of fire streaks over Missouri's night sky.;2016-07-20 22:15:00;5 seconds;Large ball of fire streaks over Missouri's night sky. I am a retired teacher living in Springfield, Missouri. I was watering my garden about 10:15 this evening.  I was not wearing a watch, but the weather news (Channel 3 KYTV broadcasts 10:35 PM - 11:37 PM) had just started when I went inside to tell my husband what I had seen.  While I have been writing this report, midnight has come and gone so this is Thursday, July 21, 2016, and it covers an event which occurred on Wednesday, July 20. The sky was clear and I could see some stars.  I was facing east when I caught a glimpse of a very large object over my left shoulder.  It appeared to be moving through the sky in a straight line from SW to NE and disappeared from view behind tree tops in my neighbor’s yard. It took about five seconds to cover less than a 90 degree portion of the sky. There is a full moon, tonight.  I know that the moon seems larger near the horizon than it does at the zenith, so it is difficult to compare the size of what I saw to the size of the moon – but the object was gigantic, more like the moon than anything else in the sky – exactly the size of a nearby street light, and as bright.  I do not mean that it illuminated the ground, but that it appeared as bright as the street light I could see at the same time. The object was yellow with a tinge of red, and looked like a flame without any sparks or smoke.  It was nearly round, tapering just a little toward the back end, but it had no tail, left no trail.  It did not blink or change its intensity. It was silent. Our local meteorologist says that, at that time, the wind was from the south at 8 miles per hour.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Bright red, circular fireball object, that gave off a bright glow.;2019-07-07 18:00:00;1 minute;Bright red, circular fireball object, that gave off a bright glow. I was on my balcony, about 50 feet from the ground, i saw one bright red object that looked to be a ball shape.  It was giving off a glow that was so red it looked to be blurry to my eyes, if that makes sense.  I could see it above the tree line, approximately 3 miles away, east.  Within 5 seconds it was hovering right over me.  It's flight patterns in the sky was unlike anything I've ever seen.  It moved in circles, it would hover low, then back up high again repeatedly.   Once the object decided to stop hovering above me, It was out of my eye sight in a matter of seconds,  I watched it until it left. It felt as if I was staring at it for a very long time (probably because I was awe) but it was only a minute.  I've never seen anything like this,  I'm a UFO sceptic but I saw something, something that wasn't of this Earth and I cannot explain to myself, so I'm here posting this.  I just wish other would've saw it too.  It was beautiful. I felt very calm and relaxed the ! whole time.  I wish to see it again soon. Unfortunately, I didn't take a photo.  The object gave off absolutely no sound at all.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
