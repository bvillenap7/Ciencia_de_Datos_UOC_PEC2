Luminescent, boomerang shaped object moving silently south.;2006-11-18 19:50:00;30 seconds;Luminescent, boomerang shaped object moving silently south. Around 7:50 Saturday night I took my dog outside. Sky was clear. Facing east and watching for falling stars since meteor shower was suppose to be visible later that night. Off to the left, slightly, there was a boomerang shaped object. It looked mostly gold though it had an almost luminescent quality to it. It reminded me of mylar ballon material. From my point of reference it looked like the size of typical passenger airplane. It moved with no noise toward the south, then seemed to waver (like looking over radiator as heat rises) and disappeared. Whole event lasted 30-60 seconds. Most amazing was feeling it left, when you know something out of ordinary has happened.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
