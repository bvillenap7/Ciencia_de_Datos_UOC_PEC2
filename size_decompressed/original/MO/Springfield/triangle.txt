Triangle shapes exhibit unusual movements.;2000-10-06 13:45:00;2-3 minutes;Triangle shapes exhibit unusual movements. Have never read a report like this one but here goes..… Traveling south on 65 hiway outside of Springfield my companion and I noted a triangle shape drop out of the cloud cover.   As a former Naval radar man I would estimate the altitude at angels 3. (three thousand feet)… The triangle shape was dark grey in color and at no time exposed its thickness.  In fact it resembled a Kite.   It would move side to side, up and down and then zip back up into the clouds.  Once when it returned it had two smaller triangle shapes with it.  They exhibited similar movements… My companion was speechless until the end of the event.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Two triangluar/chevron-shaped objects flew from zenith to horizon in less than 30 sec.;2001-12-09 00:00:00;30 seconds;Two triangluar/chevron-shaped objects flew from zenith to horizon in less than 30 sec. Two triangular/chevron-shaped objects flew across my binoculars field of view while I was observing M38, an open cluster.  M38 was almost at the zenith when I saw the two craft.  They went amazingly fast.  I followed them to the best of my abilitiy but they went down over the horizon in less than thirty seconds.  I'm not sure what velocity a craft would have to be going to get from horizon to horizon in a minute, but I know it doesn't happen with any craft known to me.  The two triangular/chevron-shaped craft were in tight formation, and did not move from it.  They went in a straight line across the sky, always staying the same distance from each other.  There were no lights on the craft, but they were visible by ambient light.  There was no noise following their pass over me.  I checked ISS visibility for my town and it was in South America when the occurance happened.  Also, the objects' direction of travel was wrong for the ISS.  In addition, the ISS is visible for 5-6 minutes when it passes over any place on earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD));37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368

Weird bright light over Springfield Missouri;2007-09-15 20:00:00;1-2 hours;Weird bright light over Springfield Missouri But around 8 p.m. or so I was watching some television and noticed a very bright white light.about the size of a floodlight. It was, at first I thought it was a helicopter or something and went back to watching some tv. What caught my attention again was the bright light was still there, this time it was a little closer and it seemed to 'hover' in place. I then got up, my curiousity grown, to inspect it. When I went upon our back porch. It was in the Northwest of the sky of our backyard. It wasnt cloudy, stars and the moon was out. You could see it through our full grown green ash tree. I also noticed that some of the lights from the other 5 houses were out, when usually you can see then on. Come to think about it, there was no stars, moon or any other light showing but just that one. Also this 'light' or UFO made no noise at all. I saw the light move really slow to the right bout a quarter of a inch.  Then it stopped and hovered. I stayed staring at it, thinking what in the heck is it? I called my mom out to c this after it just stayed for over 5 mintues in its spot. She came out, asking 'what?'. I pointed to the white light and she said it was probably a plane or helicopter. Mom, its just been hovering there She kept saying it was just one of the two until a couple mintues passed and the white light turned from white to a blue, green then back to white. We waited until it moved a bit and then stopped once again. By that time I ran inside and got my parents digital camcorder, my digital camera and my bioniclars. I brought them out and managed to film the white light. For some reason, my digital camera refused to work but the camcorder did, although at 1st it didnt want to, It even had a full battery.  While I was doing that, my mom watched and noticed it dart to the right really fast then stopped. I felt really excited cing this. I stopped filming and handed over the camcorder and picked my bioniclars up. I couldnt at first see any good image just that strange really bright white light. I brought the bioniclars down and stared as my mother and I spoke softly while keeping a eye on the light. When I put the bioniclars up once again the lights flashed from white, blue, green, yellow and white again. Althought this time, I managed to see a small shape with the white light. It looked like a trianglar shape to me 3 lights. The other two seemed like it was under more than the one we were seeing. Soon my dad, brother and his girlfriend came out and also saw the white light but couldnt see the shape I did.  After a while we just went inside but I called KOLR10 News to see if they knew anything and got told they would look into it. I hope we can find out what that strange light was.  I could still see it hovering for a hour and the last time I went to spy on it, the white light had completely vanished. After it left, all the lights came on and the stars and moon came right back out, like nothing happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Two 3 dimensional aircraft w /orange lights that didn't move.;2010-07-02 22:00:00;2 minutes;two 3 dimensional aircraft w/orange lights that didn't move While driving my husband spotted 2 objects in the sky about 400 feet in the air.  They were about 20 feet in distance between them.  They were both 3 dimensional in shape & had small orange lights. They both were pointing to the South with one on the North and one on the South.  They were still and not moving.  When I focused on them the one on the North side began to fade and then just went away.  Within 20 seconds the one on the South side just disappeared.  My husband thought it may have been fireworks as he didn't want to admit what he saw.  Although, his curiosity caused him to drive around  the block and look for them again but they were long gone.

Daytime triangular craft flying above Springfield, Missouri;2011-06-28 18:50:00;1:30;Daytime triangular craft flying above Springfield, Missouri On June 28th 2011, I was driving home from work around 6:50 PM, when I saw a glowing bright orb far north in the sky.  I knew something was so strange about it to I continued to watch it for about 30 seconds until it disappeared.  I then used my cell phone to try to capture the craft again and I did.  I saw farther south in the sky and I turned to find it in the sky.  This time is was triangular because I was closer to the craft and it flew in a odd direction and flew away.   I have the full video to share with the National UFO Reporting Center.   I posted this video on youtube but I will send you the link so you can see this video and try to get it out there to the public. http://youtu.be/_6tbnLnYDR0;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Triangle object over in at low altitude close highway 60 then moved slowly north. ((anonymous report));2016-10-21 22:40:00;~5 minutes;Triangle object over in at low altitude close highway 60 then moved slowly north. As my friend and I were driving home from shopping at the mall in Springfield, we noticed two lights in the sky.  At first I thought it was a tower then I noticed the lights were not flashing like they usually do so then we thought it was a helicopter.  I stated that I didn't think helicopters had lights like that.   We were almost right upon the object when we noticed it was in a triangle shape as well as had not two but three lights on each point.  It was just hovering there so I took a photo of it.  Shortly after taking the photo it started moving slowly north. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
A large triangle-shaped aircraft with no lights or sounds was witnessed gliding over Springfield, MO on March 2, 2017.;2017-03-02 20:00:00;1 minute;A large triangle-shaped aircraft with no lights or sounds was witnessed gliding over Springfield, MO on March 2, 2017. Around 8 pm, I saw something large, triangle shaped moving low across the horizon.  It almost had the look of a stealth fighter, but much larger and had a silver or gray color to it.  What made it strange was there were no lights, to speak of.   My wife could not see it, because it blended in with the sky, but I saw it when it first was low over the horizon, where the sky was a little lighter.   As it moved to the north over Springfield, MO, the sky was darker and it blended in with the darker sky.  There were no lights and no noises coming from the craft.  The movement was very steady.  I go outside to smoke often...usually 7 or 8 times a night and see aircraft in the sky very often from our patio, but I've never seen anything like this.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Witnessed a triangular shaped craft in the night sky while walking to my front door. It moved unnaturally smooth and fast. Not manmade.;2017-09-27 03:00:00;2 minutes;Witnessed a triangular shaped craft in the night sky while walking to my front door.  It moved unnaturally smooth and fast.  Not manmade. Witnessed a triangular shaped craft in the night sky, while walking to my front door.  It moved about 5 degrees one fluid movement unnaturally fast for a plane or helicopter.   It remained in this spot for about a minute before quickly taking off.   It had bright red and white lights that moved around the craft on its edges and did not emit any noise, something I also found odd.   The speed at which it departed was unlike anything I’ve seen.  I’m convinced it was not manmade.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
The dim lights are all that we could see with no flashing. And no visible trail or sound.;2020-12-04 22:20:00;6 seconds;The dim lights are all that we could see with no flashing. And no visible trail or sound. my friend and I were on my back patio smoking cigars and I noticed a group of what I first thought was a small group of birds but quickly realized it was not. It was 4 dim lights, 3 in a triangle formation with the 3rd just outside the triangle traveling from west to east. I have no idea how high they were so I have no idea how big the craft was. They appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed and did very slightly from flying in a straight line. we observed them until we could not see them anymore. The event only lasted about 6 seconds. And we also noticed that they made no sound that we could hear.  I am a USAF veteran and now my wife and I own a small restaurant and I'm a musician. My friend is a tile setter and is also a musician.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
