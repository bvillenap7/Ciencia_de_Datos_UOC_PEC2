Counterclockwise rotation of four lights against overcast sky.;2000-03-02 19:00:00;Approx. 25 min.;Counterclockwise rotation of four lights against overcast sky. At approx. 1900 hrs, against an overcast sky, myself and five co- workers noticed what appeared to be four widely separated lights rotating in a counterclockwise formation over the city.  The lights were about the same size as my thumbnail at arms length and their for- mation was as large as both hands at armslength.  As each revolution was completed, the lights converged, merged, then separated returning to position on the outer circumference of the circle.  These lights were fairly bright and their shape was crisp.  There was no telltale shaft of light indicating a groundbased source.  The episode lasted about 25 minutes and no sounds could be heard. ((NUFORC Note:  A person who read this report wrote to apprise us of its probable origin.  We agree that the sighting probably was caused by a four-barrel advertising light.  We receive many reports of them, and we failed to properly qualify this one.  It slipped through our editing process.  Our gratitude to Mr. J. N., whose correspondence we include below:   ((BEGIN COPIED CORRESPONDENCE.)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for the message.  We missed this one.  I agree entirely with your explanation.  We are well aware of this type of advertising light.  It astonishes me that people can look at these lights and think that they are looking at flying saucers, but when one deals with the American public, he has to be ready to handle anything. Thank you again for the message.  I will try to put a statement in the report. Cordially, Peter Davenport -- Peter B.

An odd humm;2003-02-19 23:00:00;about 30 min;an odd Hum I dont know how exciting this is but i was laying in bed trying to get to sleep and the neighbors dog was barking. A few seconds after the dog stopped barking a loud hum started to be heard. The whole time I was laying in bed listening to the hum there was no other sounds (cars, dogs, people). I kind of thought it could be a generator or something but there was absolutely no other sound. It seemed to be radiating from above my, or my neighbors house. once the hum stopped all the usual noises started back up (cars, dogs, people). I had a very odd feeling the whole time also. (like a electric feel);37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Green light seen hovering over south Springfield, then moving southwest at a rapid speed.;2005-10-20 20:00:00;4-5 seconds;Green light seen hovering over south Springfield, then moving southwest at a rapid speed. I was in my school's marching band and we were having a rehearsal outside on our football field, it was around 8:00 at night and it was mostly dark, because I think that the sun had set by then.   Our football field is laid out so that the end zones face north-to-south, and there is a set of bleachers on the west side of the field.   We were marching in a way such that the entire band was facing the west, towards the bleachers.  While we were marching I noticed a bright green spherical light source move from behind the bleachers, form the west or southwest, and move northwards and upwards so that the light source was, from my perspective, north of the bleachers and slightly above them, I'm guessing 1 to 1.5 miles away from the field.   The light source paused for about 4 seconds, not getting any brighter or fainter, which meant it was probably holding its position relative to me.   I stopped marching when I saw the light source appear.  For those 4 seconds a friend of mine who was also marching (he was a few yards away from me in the same formation), took notice of the light source and stopped marching as well.   After about 4 seconds the light source suddenly began moving away from us, towards the southwest, and increasing in altitude.  The source appeared to leave a small trail in the sky, most likely just a blur because of the speed at which it was moving.  Within about a second the light source was out of view.   My friend confirmed that he had also seen the object, and also described the things above.  If I were to estimate, I would say that the light source was about 80-100 feet in diameter.   The light source did nothing when it was hovering, making no known sound, not changing brightness, emitting nothing.  My friend and I seem to be the only people in the marching band that had seen the light source, even though it was plainly visible.   We have asked around, and nobody else claims to have seen it.  We have not done any research to find of anyone in the area had reported the sighting of ! the ligh t source.   This was one year ago we didn't report this at the time because nobody else had seen it, so we dismissed the event as just an illusion.   But recently I watched a TV program that reminded me of the event, and I asked my friend if he still remembers the event, which he still does.  We've only decided to report it now.   Both of our stories have remained unchanged, and we both can recall the event very clearly and mutually.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Saw somehting that was most surely NOT an airplane nor a sattelite!!;2008-07-07 22:00:00;30 minutes;Saw somehting that was most surely NOT an airplane nor a sattelite!! saw a very high altitude object that was thought to be a sattelite at first .   Was moving quickly from the west heading due east.  The object made an abrubt 90 degree right turn and headed south for about 2 minutes.  Made another 90 degree turn and heading back to the west.  Noticed white and red light alternating til it got withing a better eyesight and then notice blue and green lights alternating.  Object made a tight zig zag pattern about 4 zig zags....appeared to almost come to a complete stop.   Looked like the object was spinning or there were lights spinning under near.  Was too high in the sky to see very clearly.  Lights or object stopped spinning .....and quickly moved out of sight line headin due west.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Fire ball like object over springfield, mo;2011-07-05 21:28:00;1 min;fire ball like object over springfield, mo Swimming at twilight with my family in the backyard, my daughter asked me what was in the sky.  I looked up and seen a fireball like object traveling below the clouds.  It was traveling in a straight line from the south east to the north west and appeared to be on fire.   From our viewing angle it was slightly north of the southern end of Springfield and appeared to be almost directly above us.   I brought it to my wifeâ€™s attention and the three of us watched it streak across the sky until it disappeared in the tree line.   The whole event lasted approximately one minute.   It was 21:28 on 07/05/2011.  The sky was mostly clear with a few high clouds.   I work in the HVAC industry, my wife is a RN and my daughter is in high school.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
White light and low pitched noise, Electric Doggy Door operated on it`s own.;2012-11-09 02:30:00;1.30 minutes;white light and low pitched noise, Electric Doggy Door operated on it`s own. The wife and I were woke at 2:30 am by the sound of a low pitched hum and white light illuminating through all windows in my home.  Also my Dog Entry door in my kitchen door opened and closed twice.  By the time I got super quickly  clothed and made it out the door, the light had vanished and all was quiet.  Several neighbors came out in the street,hearing the same thing, but no one saw what it was. No way was this a plane, helicopter or any thing I`ve ever seen or heard of that flies that eists of this earth, and I`m big into aviation.  Also, living near the airport, planes fly over my home all day long and my Doggy Door never has malfunctioned.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
Unknown very, very fast objects in a formation followed by other objects moments later.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-20 22:15:00;5-6 seconds;Unknown very, very fast objects in a formation followed by other objects moments later. While observing the lunar eclipse, I noticed objects in the sky going west to east at a high rate of speed.  The objects were grouped in 3 vee formations side by side of 2 or 3.  The objects were lighter than the clear black sky which is why my attention was brought to them.   The entire event transpired over only a few seconds which left me puzzling if I had actually seen them, but suddenly I saw 2 more objects following in a position that would have been to the left (as oriented looking to the east as the moon progressed) of the original grouping.  The sky was very clear and very black and the objects were at extreme altitude as they passed at a rapid clip and soon vanished.   These objects moved so much faster than any other extraterrestrial objects that I have observed since seeing Telstar as a youth.;37.186164902507;-93.2820066852368
