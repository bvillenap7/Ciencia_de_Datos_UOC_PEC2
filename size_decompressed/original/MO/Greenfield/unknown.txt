A bright, blue light lasting for 15 seconds.;2011-03-27 06:40:00;15 seconds;A bright, blue light lasting for 15 seconds. We were sleeping in the guest bedroom at my daughter’s house. I woke up to go to the bathroom at 6:40am and the bedroom was dark. Just as I lay back in bed, the sky lit up with a bright blue light which filled the room. I got up and looked out the window—It looked like bright daylight, blue in hue, not yellow. Then it stopped and was back to darkness. I say dark, even though it was morning, it had been raining and was overcast (no thunderstorms), so was definitely not naturally light enough for what I was seeing. It lasted about 15 seconds total. My wife also woke up and saw this light. Our first thoughts were that it was some sort of security light, or perhaps someone drove up the driveway, but the bedroom is on the second story, and my daughter lives on 180 acres out in the country—there is only a security light by the barn, but it comes on automatically from dusk to dawn and was still on when the bright light quit and returned to darkness.;37.4228;-93.8428
