UFO hovering moving in very slow - later moving in a zigzag line going southeast;2010-07-11 21:00:00;21:00-22:00;UFO hovering moving in very slow - later moving in a zigzag line going southeast My husband and I went out to have a cigarette in the backyard.  Our backyard is pretty dark and we can see all the stars at night.  I looked over to the northwestern skyline an noticed a very bright object hovering but slowly moving to the right and forward and then backward?.  The object was very bright and triangular shaped.  Then disappeared beneath the treeline.  About 25-30 minutes later, my husband went out to see if the object had reappeared.  He yelled for me to come out and take a look.  The object was now moving in an unusual eratic almost zigzag form flying southeast.  We noticed 3 redish orange lights and then disappeared.  I have to say we are both feeling quite dumbfounded.   Once the object disappeared from the southwest was what looked to be a star moving in the same direction as the object and then also disappeared.   There was no sound, no lights blinking.  This was not an airplane or helicopter and I'm certain it wasn't a satellite.   We don'! t have too much knowledge on the unmanned military aircraft which I guess could be a possible.  This was by far the oddest thing we both have ever witnessed in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.4723;-90.5231000000002
