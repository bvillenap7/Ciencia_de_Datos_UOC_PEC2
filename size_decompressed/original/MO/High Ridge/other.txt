Reddish orange silent orb on new years eve 2012 Missouri;2012-01-01 00:00:00;Few minutes;Reddish orange silent orb on new years eve 2012 Missouri Just before midnight new years eve and after on three seperate occasions within about a half hour timeline ending about 12:15am. My wife and sister in law stepped out for a smoke and noticed a silent reddish orange orb hovering above the treeline moving away into the distance til it dissapeared. Then bout 10 minutes later my brother in law and stepson we're outside and saw the same orb above the treeline again and my kid caught the orb on his phone camera for a few seconds then said to have just dissapeare again. After that we went on with the new years countdown inside not thinking much of what happened. And if it couldn't get any stranger it does. Just after the ball drop me and my wife go outside for a smoke. I look the other way and my wife yells i  turn around towards the woodsO and there it was again a reddish orb rising of the the woods clear as day. I turn back around and yell to my family that the orb they were talking about was back.  Then all six o! f us were there to see it.It went straight up so smooth and effortlessly and then made a 90 degree curved turn and hovered off in the distance and never made a sound and I would have to guess it was with a few mIles.   But after I picked my jaw off the ground I remembered that I had my iPod and caught the last few minutes on video and catching our reactions. it's a little dark but it's there with some cleaning of the video maybe someone can shed some light on this.  So by the end of the we got 6 wittnesses and two videos of this. When I first saw it we were on the porch and it appeared west of us at eye level in the woods rose I'd say about a mile then headed north for a few more miles before it was out of sight. As far as the first two sightings this nite I was not there for the third I was.;38.4723;-90.5231000000002
