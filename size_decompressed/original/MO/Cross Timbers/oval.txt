Edge of oval object near Cross Timbers,MO;2007-04-09 09:40:00;5 min.;Edge of oval object near Cross Timbers,MO My husband and I were going north on 65 highway between Preston and Cross Timbers at 9.40 p.m. We were both looking north and at the same noticed what we thought was a falling star. It was bright orange and started shooting off a row of  4 yellow/orange lights,they went up instead of down like a falling star. This lasted a few seconds. About a minute later it happened again. This time it was more to the east. By this time we were about a mile south of Cross Timbers when on the east side of 65 highway half hidden in the clouds was the edge of an oval object with the same row of lights. It was just sitting there. The lights this time were really bright,lighting up what ever it was. We slowed down but didn't stop until we got home. It was a dark night with no stars out. We have lived here all our lives and never seen anything like this. People have seen stelth boomers, but, this wasn't shaped like one. We aren't sure if it was one or three dirrerent objects.;38.0298;-93.2011
