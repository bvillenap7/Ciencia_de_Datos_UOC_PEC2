Very fast white spheroid objects followed by stealths.;2008-10-08 18:00:00;45 min.;Very fast white spheroid objects followed by stealths. My 13 yo daughter and I saw a white possibly some grayish tinge spheroid object moving at about 5x the speed of a passenger jet in a straight path above my house while in the backyard. My younger kids and neighbor kids could not see them.   It was a clear day without wind about an hour before sunset. There was no sound emitted, lights or exhaust trail observed from the object.  I viewed the object moving from west to east directly towards STL at about half to a third or maybe at the height of jet airliners that fly over that path.  I contacted my wife and a couple of neighbors after i saw another object. They also saw about 8 -10 more objects intermittently for about a half hour. They appeared to go over the same path but not exactly, some higher some lower but not too different, but at a similar velocity and straight line path west to east.   The last object I saw was higher up which I pointed out to my neighbor.  About 30 seconds after that last object was seen 3 stealth fighters appeared in single file formation but spaced out, were directly behind the  path of that last object.  There was also a jet airliner  elavating toward the south that flew very close right underneath the stealths.  The last object I saw flying ahead of the stealths was moving about 2-3x the speed of the military craft.  It was a very clear day. Four adults and a teenager saw them and cannot ID them as birds, balloons in a jet stream or any aircraft we have ever seen.  They were fast, you could only view them for about 15 seconds until they faded to the east, whereas the stealths were visible for about 4 x as long and easily identified. The last object seem to be about a third of the size as the stealths and a little less elevated but on a similar path.  The stealths were barely audible.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
White/silver orb over O'Fallon on 7/4/10;2010-07-04 21:10:00;8 minutes;White/silver orb over O'Fallon on 7/4/10 My husband and I were at TR Hughes Ballpark, off I-70 on 7/4/2010, at dusk, preparing to watch the fireworks display, when we saw what appeared to be a white/silver sphere shaped object in the sky, moving from the south to the north.  It traveled in a linear fashion and was moving at a fairly rapid speed.  Initially we thought it was either a balloon or some sort of firework, but the object was too consistent in speed and moved in a perfectly straight line.  It flew fairly low in the sky as well.  We continued to watch it move north, at which time it appeared to change color, to a darker grey/silver color.  We continued to watch it until it was no longer in our view. My husband and I are both very objecive, skeptical people and were hesitant to report our sighting, in lieu of the holiday fireworks.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
Orange/amber sphere moving south to north over O'Fallon, MO;2010-07-04 21:17:00;60 seconds;Orange/amber sphere moving south to north over O'Fallon, MO We were facing due east watching fireworks from our back yard and saw an orange/amber glowing sphere moving south to north at 9:17 pm Central. Initially, we assumed it was a firework, but quickly realized that it wasn't.  It was not an aircraft because it had no flashing lights indicative of an airplane or helicopter.  We have two airports in close proximity and see air traffic regularly, and I'm familiar with the appearance of aircraft landing lights in foggy or cloudy conditions.  Additionally, landing lights would not appear the color of this object, nor would they form a clearly defined spherical shape. The object was a glowing orange/amber sphere or orb.  It maintained a constant speed and altitude, while traveling on a flat trajectory from south to north.  It left no trail (contrail or smoke) and made no sound.  The object remained visible for roughly one minute, leaving only enough time to grab a digital camera from our kitchen and take one picture before it moved over the north horizon out of view. The cloud cover reported at Lambert International Airport (25 miles away) was cloudy at 7,000 ft and mostly cloudy at 15,000 ft.  The object must have been below 15,000 ft in order to have remained clearly visible.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
Seven orange orbs in the formation of the Big Dipper that individually hovered and moved across the sky acscending to the atmosphere.;2013-08-24 22:30:00;20 minutes;Seven orange orbs in the formation of the Big Dipper that individually hovered and moved across the sky acscending to the atmosphere. Seven orange orbs in formation of the Big Dipper appeared in the sky in O'Fallon, MO, in my subdivision of Patriot's Landing.  They were relatively low to the ground and glowed.  My boyfriend, Henryk, and I got out of our van to observe this phenonomal formation.  One by one each one moved in a north to south direction, only to rise upwards into the atmosphere vanishing.  There was no sound, no flashing lights --- only solid, glowing orange light for each unidentified object.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
A white (very bright sphere approached on the south side of highway at high speed, horizontal & parallel to highway.);2018-06-21 04:45:00;5 seconds;A White (very bright sphere approached on the south side of highway at high speed, horizontal & parallel to highway Driving on 64 (Highway 40) heading east to St Louis.  A White (very bright sphere approached on the south side of highway (right side of my van) at high speed, horizontal and parallel to highway.  It was not coming from above, but horizontal.  No contrail or light tail behind - just an extremely bright sphere.  Once it passed me, it increased its speed exponentially and reduced its size and then trailed south growing smaller and extremely faster as it disappeared, it did not curve towards the earth but veered southwardly and disappeared. Increasing in speed.  No sound.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
