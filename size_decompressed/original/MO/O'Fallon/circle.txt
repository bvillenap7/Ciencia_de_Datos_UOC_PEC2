They were in a zig zag pattern like looking at a constellation only they were very close like helicopters in the sky.  We watched this for at least 5 minutes with two poeple claiming to throw out a local news paper.  The objects looked like ufo's because they made no sound.  It was like watching a movie about the earth being invated. It was the most unexplainable thing that has ever happened to us.  We live in O Fallon. Missouri.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
Multiple red/orange lights in sky shaped similar to bid dipper.;2019-11-25 20:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple red/orange lights in sky shaped similar to bid dipper. My son and I were coming home around 8 pm when we look to the W and noticed probably 10-12 orange lights in the sky.  We both said it looked like the big dipper.  We continued to see them as we traveled approx. 1 mile then turned left to try and get closer to see what they were.  At this point the next time we spotted them I was able to get a picture but this time only 5 were visible.  They were ascending into the sky.  Clear night and well above house and tree lines so were not Christmas lights or radio towers.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
