I went out to my car and noticed a low bright light cross the sky in front of me. At first I thought it was a shooting star or airplane.  Then I started looking up and noticed 4 other objects hovering in the low sky with bright lights.  The objects would move up/down/back/forth dimming everytime we attempted video.  I was able to get some pictures using my cell & the Camera360 app once I adjusted the filter & zoomed it.  Each of the (UFO) had the same image except that some were vertical & some were horizontal.  They stayed in the sky for hours just moving up/down & side to side. In the pictures they took on a red circle light in the middle of what appearree to resemble dark cylinder/disk space on the ends. In one of my pictures just left of the object I discover something faint white in the shape of a box hovering too.  It was bearly visible in the picture. I thought I could hear a low motor of some sorts.  I drove out to St. Peters and could still see the objects in the sky & could hear the sound.  Still.  On my way back, another object appearred low in the sky looking West on Mexico Rd.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
