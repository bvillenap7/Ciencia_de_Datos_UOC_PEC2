WHEN I PULLED ;1997-11-11 01:00:00;2 MIN;ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT I HAD JUST GOTTING OFF WORK AND STOPPED AT A STORE FOR A SOFT DRINK AND SOMETHING TO MUN CH ON. WHEN I PULLED UP TO MY DRIVEWAY I GOT OUT AND AFTER I CLOSED THE DRIVERS DOOR I LOOKED UP TO SEE IF IT WAS CLOUDY OR NOT. THIS IS WHEN I NOTICED A VERY LARGE SLOWLY MOVING SOFT-GLOWING TRIANGLE MOVING FROM NORTH TO SOUTH UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND SOME CLOUDS. IT MADE NO SOUND AS IT MOVED. I WAS VERY SCARED .;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
1998 BT over hwy 70 - OFallon Missouri;1998-06-01 20:00:00;at least 20 mins;1998 BT over hwy 70 - OFallon Missouri month/day is approx.  My husband was driving, I was passenger. Driving east on highway 70 in O'Fallon area, just east of Hwy 40.  Suddenly, we hear low hummings, like many aircraft.  Looking out the cars front window, at first glance, looked like helicoptors or F fighters in escort - but in a wide V formation?   We rolled down the windows.  Husband began to drive very slowly in the emergency lane.  I looked out my side window and saw many aircraft with flashing lights, both jets and helicopters in the sky.   Then I noticed a section of the sky a dull black .. and that it was moving slowly.  And it was what the escort aircraft were surrounding!   All aircraft involved could not have been more than half a mile up.  I could determine which were helicopters & which were jets, if that is a judge of how far up they were.   All in all, the entire V formation (aircraft + BT) covered both east & west bound lanes of the highway equally 8 lanes plus emergency lanes.  This was not a small sized event!   Well we could not believe our eyes!   What was this huge dark triangle that was so black, no emissions, no sound, no color, flew so slow and low to the ground?  It kept a straight and even paced course.  My first thought was oh my word, not only is Boeing near, Scott AFB is not that far either.   My husband got a bit ahead under it and I looked more and more closer and noticed that it was flat and triangular.  No reflections under, etc. What appeared to be lights on its side, were indeed the aircraft surrounding it.  It was thee strangest thing I ever seen.  And ominous. After about 15 minutes my husband pulled over to the side of the road.  We got out of the car and watched it move slowly away over highway 70.  I remember thinking why do not more people pull over and watch this?  But my eyes were more glued to the skies than worried to see just who was or not pulled over to watch.   As we watched the dark triangle & escort fly off east, following highway 70s course, (geesh how blatant I kept thinking), I remember noticing that it appeared rather thin in thickness ... which added more to the whole bizarreness.   I barely remember getting into the car.  And I do not recall the drive home. NOTE: when the object was directly over us I felt sick to my stomache.

It was triangular shaped with two large circular lights centered across the craft.;2005-08-15 05:12:00;4 minutes;I was traveling east on highway 70 at 5:12 am going to work in the morning.  This is morning pre rush hour traffic.  There were many cars that could have seen this.   The object was approximately 1000 ft up or less.  When I first saw it at a distance(2 miles), my first thought, was that it was a helicopter and there was an accident up ahead.  Because the craft was not moving across the sky like a plane but staying in place like a helicopter.   As I got closer I definitely new it was not a helicopter and it was moving extremely slow heading northwest.  It was triangular shaped with two large circular lights centered across the craft.  The outside edge was clearly visible due to these lights.   The craft was moving with the front of the craft being one point with the other two points trailing.  So, it was not leading with a side but the point.   I rolled the window down as I was driving to see if I could hear anything, and did not hear anything.  Just the noise of the air rushing in.   But as I approached the craft from 2 miles away it definitely was moving slowly huvering it seemed.   I also made it a point to look for commercial air craft since this is near the airport and Boeing (formerly McDonnell Douglas).  I saw no other aircraft in the area.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
Three strange ufos, make formation and break apart while flashing.;2011-11-15 19:00:00;30 min;three strange ufos, make formation and break apart while flashing. It was night and i was driving home and i noticed a three bright white lights moving very close to one another in a strait line as if they were plane headlights.  Next thing i Knew the three lights spirald out ward into a triangle formation.  the three bright lights began to flash red and white in a fast pattern,as its triangle formation continued to spiral and grow.   Then the three flashing balls seprated in all diffrent directions.  I saw many of theses strage lights for about the next 15 minutes.  They would apperar and disappear all over the sky as if observing or somthing.   I tried to video tape on my phone after i had relized the balls were spiraling. not to sure if it shows anything, maybe if someone has better image enahancing software.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
Dark boomerang craft, no lights, gliding across O'Fallon, Mo., skies;2013-10-09 20:40:00;15 seconds;Dark boomerang craft, no lights, gliding across O'Fallon Mo. skies Blended perfectly in the nights sky, miracle I noticed it.  The movement caught my eye.   Hard to estimate size, since I would first have to estimate the altitude....but I'd say it was lower then air plane I've ever seen fly.  Maybe a few hundred feet.  The angle I saw was side to belly of the craft.  I viewed it for about 10-15 seconds before I lost sight of it due to trees/ line of sight.  It looked like it had a wing span, likely V shaped.  No lights what so ever.  It looked dark grey in color (very very clear night here in St. Louis tonight).  No sound. It was graceful...it glided utterly silently in the night.    This will wound even crazier, but it left behind a sort of very subtle blurry end trail as went by.  The trail it left looked sort of distorted, wavy....like the street on a hot hot summer day.  I don't know who to report this to.  Should I call the police?  It's been almost 2 hours now, and I haven't heard anything about it on the radio, news or internet.  It was so discreet that I now find myself thinking these things could be out here every night, and no one might see them unless they got lucky like I did. Creepy.  Does this sound like a military operation/practice?  Maybe a surveillance drone or something?;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968

My friend and I were bow fishing near Dalbow Rd. Off of Highway 79 when we got lost following the stream, moving to different landmarks;2014-03-30 22:30:00;10 minutes;My friend and I were bow fishing near Dalbow Rd., off of Highway 79, when we got lost following the stream, moving to different landmarks.   Having no idea where we are, we wait for a train and follow the noise because we had lost our internal compasses by that point and figured we'd follow the tracks back to the road.  We ended up finding a road (had to cross a stream, I got soaked). We followed this road left and found a little, tiny house.  Then about a quarter mile up we found the actual house, we saw who must've been the owner leave about 5 minutes before we got on the road.  We turned around and we jogged the other direction. It wasn't completely dark yet, but just about.  We saw three orange lights in a triangle formation.  There were some towers out there with lights on them and stars, but this was neither.  It was extremely close to us, maybe 1-200ft away and 50ft into the air.  It wasn't moving at all and was a hundred or so feet long.   There was a hazy body in between the three lights.  Looked like it blended in with the black/purple part of the sky that it was inhabiting.  One light especially would dim and brighten randomly.  It got intensely bright two times.   We took our eyes off of it while we were running and it was gone when we looked again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
