Dim orange/yellow rectangular object moving fairly quickly across night sky;2013-08-10 21:23:00;10-20 seconds;Dim orange/yellow rectangular object moving fairly quickly across night sky At 9:23 p.m. CST while looking at the stars from my patio, I noticed a dimly lit object moving roughly NW to SE at what I would consider to be a fairly high rate of speed.   The object was evenly lit (i.e. all parts of the object appeared to be emitting the same amount of light across it), orange/yellow in color and less bright than the star field in the background.  The intensity of the light was constant and there was no flashing or pulsating to it.  It was either silent or high enough in the sky that there was no sound.  It did not look like a point of light (like a star or plane at high altitude), but a very slightly curved, rectangular shape with the leading edge being the longer side of the object.  I was nearly directly overhead.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
