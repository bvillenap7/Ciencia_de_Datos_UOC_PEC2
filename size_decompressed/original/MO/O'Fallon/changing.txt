After slow hesitation...disappeared quickly! At 7:53 pm on Oct. 31, 2010 we saw a very bright light in the sky. Not sure how to describe. Like 2 bright stars touching each other. It appeared to be about 4 or 5 miles from us. About a 25 degree angle in the sky.  We were in our driveway in Wentzville, Mo facing east toward Josephville/O'fallon, Mo. It was still for about 4 min., then started slowly changing colors from white to a reddish glow/flash to a greennish glow/flash. Then it looked like it separated into 2 shapes  like balloons almost touching each other with a reddish glow to it, and went out of our sight behind a rooftop... then out of no where,  the light appeared again. Like it circled an area and came back to starting point.  It was a bright light again, but more rounded or diamond shaped. It looked like it was a little closer at first, then went back to same area. It looked like it was flashing lights and spinning.When it would move, it looked like it was shadowed like a moon, but you could see it happen as it would spin. It was eventually getting smaller, further away, almost like it was hesitating. Then it vanished quickly with a slight tracer. That was the last time we saw it.  It disappeared from our sight at 8:02pm to the east north east.  Have video, file to big to send via email.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968

Either a carefully carried out national hoax, or clever aliens disguising themselves in fireworks, as a logical fallback assumption.   Aside from this theory we were watching fireworks on the roof.  Suddenly, 5 ball like orange lights rose from the horizon line.  I pointed it out and my older brother and his girlfriend went, Holy crap, look at that.  Do you see that, and took pictures excitingly.   I was weary of this happening the whole night.  I kept looking up and thinking about ufos beforehand oddly enough.  Everything felt surreal.  2 years ago, we saw the same thing in Kirkwood. They flew in single file for about two minutes, making random arrangements.  Suddenly, two began to flicker out.  I said outloud that I bet they're going to make a triangle.  Within minutes they did.  My brother was astonished that it came true and I got the chills.   She snapped pictures and showed me.  I think fireworks smog the atmosphere so these ufo's can be given a chance to spy.  Who or what was behind it, is still unknown.  I was a little terrified but also amazed.  I felt dizzy and confused after the experience.  They felt fine. Later that night, red lights rolled through the clouds in fleets.  A loud humming sound was produced.  I was alone, during this separate sighting on the same night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
Group of orange colored lights.;2013-09-28 21:10:00;2 minutes;Group of orange colored lights. At approximately 2110 on the night of sept 28th, my wife and I were driving to a friends house when we witnessed a group of 6-10 orange lights in the SE part of the sky.  We pulled over and observed for about 2 min.  The orange lights changed shape and world rearrange.  As I began to video the lights they began to burn out one by one until they were gone.  A plane also flew what appeared to be right through the path of the orange lights as they were burning out.  When we arrived at our friends house we played back the video only to find nothing on it. I am a professional ATP rated pilot with a college degree and consider myself and my wife of above average intelligence. I have never seen anything like this.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
