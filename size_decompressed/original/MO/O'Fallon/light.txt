bright blue light, was doing something;2005-07-31 01:00:00;4 seconds;bright blue light, was doing something I was sitting outside looking up as usual.  I focused on a standard movement in the  North West sky I was  thinking that it was just another 'light'.  I can spot them almost any night I want.   I saw a faint white light, almost undiscernable.  (If a friend was standing there they wouldnt have seen it w/out me spotting it, Ive trained myself to see faint lights.  It was a variably speed and  was slowly 'weaving', as if its occupants were drunk.   I knew it was REAL close ( >1 mi), so I grabbed my binoculars.  Then saw a definite blue light w/no other colors flying from the northwest to the north.  Within an instant the object turned directly toward me.   The craft's blue light was pointed directly in my position, because the degree of light intensity was almost blinding in the binoc's.  It all happened in 3 to 4 sec's and it scared me so bad cause it was so close and not a normal phenomenom, that my fear caused me to throw down my binoc's and i ran inside.  I live w/in 15 miles of an international airport.  The craft was not a plane.  It zipped away in the beat of a heart.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
Bright flickering object seen in Western/Northwestern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));2008-05-16 22:00:00;40 minutes;Bright flickering object seen in Western/Northwestern sky ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD)) I reported this with Mufon. I will use the exact content as in that report:  Long Description of Sighting Report My husband and I noticed an extremely bright flickering object in the western sky last night. We have seen this on occasion, and assumed at the time it was a star. Last night I looked out the window to see if the sky was still clear (we have been pounded by rain in the Midwest lately). I noticed two flickering objects in the western sky, and I grabbed the binoculars to see if they were planes. They did not move like the planes we see over our home, which have a different light pattern, and typically move quicker, either heading to or from the airport. By the time we grabbed the binoculars, we were only observing one object. The other object had moved out of our sight. It looked fairly stationary, so that's why I didn't think it was a plane to begin with, but line of sight maybe created an illusion.  I grabbed my Sony 20x Optical/800x digital zoom 8MM video camera. I had to put it on a tripod to keep it steady as you will get extremely jerky movement trying to zoom in on distant objects with digital zoom. (very sensitive to the slightest camera movement.) I used the Night Shot Plus option (infrared) on the camera to record. I taped about 40 minutes. During this time I had to readjust the camera several times as the object would move out of frame once I had a steady focus on it.  I captured the video this morning an up loadable digital file. I edited out most of the jerky movements caused by me trying to refocus and reposition the object in the camera frame. (There still are some on the video and they are obvious quick up and down movements.) I do have some steady video clips of the object in frame and you can see the object moving left to right out of frame on its own. I put the clips together in one file.  I guess this could be an extremely bright star but I do not know enough about celestial objects and how quickly they should move out of frame based on our planet's rotation. The object also gives off a rotation of colors.  Video clip is loaded up in the Mufon database if you want to see it.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
2 orange lights travelling in a loose formation West to East about 20 degrees above the horizon;2008-10-31 20:15:00;3 minutes;Noticed 2 orange lights travelling in a loose formation West to East about 20 degrees above the horizon. The lights had the appearance of a flare that seemed to defy the logic of an airborne flare. The lights started to descend over a distance before starting to climb to 30 degrees above horizon and possibly turn to the North before fading out. The lights travelled at a constant speed. These lights were in view for approximately 3 minutes. 4 witnesses saw these lights from the same perspective.

Bright red noiseless light traveled south to north at an altitude of 7,000 -10,000 ft for 7 minutes before blinking then disappearing.;2009-11-23 17:40:00;approximately 7 minutes;Bright red noiseless light traveled south to north at an altitude of 7,000 -10,000 ft for 7 minutes before blinking then disappearing. It was a clear night and I was outside putting up Christmas lights.  I stepped back from the house and looked up to check the lights when I noticed a bright red light in the southern sky.  It was a little lower and to the left of the moon, about 45 degrees above the horizon.  It was about 3 times as large as Jupiter and about 3 times as bright.  I watched it for a while expecting to see some navigation lights appear as it approached me.  As it got closer I saw no additional lights and noticed it made no noise. I ran inside to get the binoculars so I could get a closer look, as it was flying almost directly overhead.  Through the binoculars I saw no discernible shape to the object, just a bright red light quietly going across the sky.  It maintained the same altitude and did not flicker or change direction.  I decided to run inside to get my camera to take some pictures.  I managed to get a few shots, however as I am not that skilled with my camera while taking night shots, I had some trouble getting the auto focus to act right.  The pictures show a red (out of focus) spherical light.  As I watched it travel north off into the distance it then started to blink and went out as if someone had turned off a switch.  I believe it blinked about 5 times prior to it disappearing. Besides the moon, this was the brightest object in the sky.  I would say the entire event took about seven minutes and when I went inside to write down the specifics I noted the time was 5:47 P. M. central time.  I live about 30 minutes west of St. Louis Lambert airport so I see airplane traffic all the time, most of which travels west-east.  I hardly ever see any traffic flying south-north (especially this low). About 10 minutes after the event I saw a plane coming in for a landing at Lambert airport, this object was roughly at the same altitude.  I am not that good at guessing altitudes so I was using this as my guide for an estimate.  My spouse said that my “incoming plane analogy” would indicate an altitude for the object of about 7,000 - 10,000 ft.  Please note it was not a plane or helicopter.  The body of a commercial plane at that height and directly above can clearly be seen on a cloudless night.  Additionally, engine noise and navigation lights for a plane should be easily discernable, none of which were observed. Again, the red light maintained the same altitude, did not flicker, made no noise and maintained a roughly south to north path.  I have never observed anything remotely like this before.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
5 orange lights, blinking, over the lit up baseball field and then after 5 min., faded until no longer visible ((anonymous report));2016-09-14 20:30:00;5 minutes;5 orange lights steadily blinking over the lit up baseball field and then after 5 minutes faded until no longer visible ((anonymous)) My husband and I witnessed 5 lights with the color of a true orange hovering over one of the lit up baseball fields in the area on our way home from the grocery store.  They were synchronized and steadily blinking close to the tree line.   After a few minutes they continued blinking but faded until they were no longer visible.   The formation didn’t necessarily make out a shape but you could tell it was massive.  The outline was a foreign object incomparable to anything well known or we could make sense of.

Bright white light zoomed across sky;2019-10-17 20:25:00;2 seconds;Bright white light zoomed across sky Was walking my dog and I saw this super bright white light zoom across the sky.  Definitely too close/bright/fast to be a plane.  saw it for less than 2 seconds and it disappeared behind the tree line;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
Orb UAPs with a misty object hovering close by;2020-10-22 01:54:00;less than one minute;Orb UAPs with a misty object hovering close by UAPs 10/22/20 1:54:54 PM  It was early afternoon and I was driving on an outer service road heading to the grocery store. It was a mostly clear day and I noticed some chem-trail activity in the sky when an airplane came into my view. It seemed a bit odd-shaped and I wasn’t quite sure if I was seeing an airplane or something else. My phone was close by so I took a quick picture. When I got home, I looked at the picture and was surprised to see some orb-like UAPs with a misty object hovering close by.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
