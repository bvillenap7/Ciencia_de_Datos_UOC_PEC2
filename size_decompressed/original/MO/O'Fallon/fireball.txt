Light's in the sky over O' Fallon Missouri;2010-06-03 22:15:00;5 min;Light's in the sky over O' Fallon Missouri 06/03/10 & 06/04/10   Over July 3rd I was at the O' Fallon, MO, fair watching the fireworks display and seen one of the light's coming form the Southeastern sky and then heading toward the Northwest, looking up at it looked like a mini hot air balloon, but I could not see it very well because the sky was very dark.  Then as it moved toward the Northwest it went up into the clouds.  Then minutes later I saw the second one and the third one. They all took similar paths. I seen other people looking up at it too.  There was a big crowd, about a few thousand people there. On July 4th I was at home in O' Fallon watching whole neighborhood shot fireworks off, one neighbor down the street shots off about a grand worth of fireworks each year and a bunch of the neighbor's ware sitting in the street watching his display and I seen about three more of the lights go over head and looking about the same, but coming more from the South and heading north.   Some of the neighbors seen them too. I live about 5 miles to the south of the place where the fair was.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968

We watched it as it moved from right to left across the sky, it was a lot higher than the fireworks were.  We know it wasn't a plane a helicopter or fireworks.  We reluctantly called the police department and reported what we saw.  Of course the dispatcher thought we were just seeing fireworks, but we know it wasn't fireworks for sure.  It was a UFO under intelligent power.  We always wondered if anyone else saw what we saw that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Orange fireball flying low following the highway.;2014-06-20 20:45:00;20 seconds;Orange fireball flying low following the highway. Heading eastbound on hwy 40/61, at 8:45pm CST, I notice an orange flickering light coming westbound, off in the distance approximately 1 mile away.  It was following the highway.   As it got closer I see it is an orange fireball.   I stuck my head out the window as it flew directly over my head, about 10 seconds from first sight, and at the hwy DD/Winghaven exit and I look up at it.  As it was coming towards me as well as when it was directly over me it appeared to be an orange fireball with a black center.  It was flying very low. As I was driving at the time, I could only look up at it for a second or two, looked back at the road, then looked back at it out my driver side window.  I did not see the orange fire from behind, but only the shadow of a craft before I had to look away again.   I have heard of the orange fireballs on C2Cam, or else I would have thought this was a plane on fire.  I looked a again for it behind me and saw nothing.  From first sight to end do sighting was about 20 secs.;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
