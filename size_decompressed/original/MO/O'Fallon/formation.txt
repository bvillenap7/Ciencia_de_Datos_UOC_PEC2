A series of objects, approx. 30-50, flying in a straight line, singularly and some by 2s, and triangular and diamond formations.;2014-09-10 21:00:00;30 minutes (?);A series of objects, approx. 30-50, flying in a straight line, singularly and some by 2s, and triangular and diamond formations. Around 9-10 pm on the night of 09/10/2014, my son and I were driving to my house.  As we drove on the street before turning into my subdivision, we saw a line of lights, all the same size, to our left-hand side up in the sky.  They “sparkled” like a star appearing to change colors somewhat…my son described it as looking like a “burning ember”, basically white, but they would flicker, sometimes reddish, sometimes orangish…maybe from the gases in the air that make stars sparkle?  There were no lights on the object that could be likened to a plane. The line was traveling from a southwesterly to northeasterly direction. A direction if maintained could lead directly to St. Louis International  Airport. They were traveling in a single file, straight line horizontally across the sky with approximately the same amount of distance between them. We kept watching them as we turned into my subdivision, and they just kept coming…at least 20 had passed by in a straight line fashion either singularly or in formations of 2, 3 or 4 before we pulled over to video tape what we were seeing. So, we made a right turn into the parking lot of our subdivision swimming pool to pull over to watch them and take a video with my cell phone. They just kept coming and coming, some singularly, some side by side, some in a triangular formation and some in a diamond pattern.  There was virtually no sound.  They seemed to be flying fairly low and there were so many of them we surely would have heard any sound emanating from them.  At one point, I commented that we thought we heard a very slight sound, but cannot confirm it came from the objects As you can tell my comments the number of them was quite impressive and inexplicable.  Our guesstimate of total numbers would be about 50 or so.  This whole incident lasted approximately 20-30 minutes from the time we first spotted them until stopped taping. I am going to attempt to forward the video I took.  On the left side of the screen at times you will see the lights of the pool house, the poolhouse itself and the fence…but you can clearly see when I “zero” in on the flying objects.  There is also a little “floater” of a light that shows on the screen but that is not related to the flying objects either…and you can tell the difference because the objects in the sky are brighter and all the same size. PS – my son and his family are currently living in Orlando, FL, and reports seeing something similar in the sky a couple of months ago,;38.7856444104135;-90.7338482388968
We observed lights in the sky in a formation of some sort.;2015-03-15 21:45:00;5 minutes;We observed lights in the sky in a formation of some sort. The lights were yellow to golden in color.  They traveled over US going north across interstate 70… and close behind them a 2nd formation of the same type of lights. It was very odd and we have never seen anything like this before. I looked online to see if anyone else had reported or could explain what we saw and have found no explanation. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes, correct, the 15th.
