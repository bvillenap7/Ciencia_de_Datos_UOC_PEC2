One object with two white lights, one red and one blue light hovering without sound about 300 - 400 feet in the air.;2009-10-23 19:05:00;1.5 minutes;One object with two white lights, one red and one blue light hovering without sound about 300 - 400 feet in the air. My husband was driving.  I was in the front passenger seat and my mother-in-law and daughters were in the back.  I first noticed two white lights in the sky about 300 - 400 feet up.  My first thought was that it was a small plane or helicopter.  As we drove towards it, I pointed it out to my husband who now also saw it.  It was dark and there was some cloud coverage.  As we got closer, we noticed that there were 2 white lights that appeared to be in upper corners.  On the bottom there was a red light and a blue light.  The object appeared to be hovering.  It did not move as we drove past and I did not hear any noise other than our own vehicle.  I would estimate that it was about 300 feet to the right of the road.  It appeared to be bigger than a helicopter based on the distance between the lights, but no bigger than maybe two put together. We continued driving home about 2 miles, dropped off my mother-in-law and daughters and then drove back.  We did not see! anything, so we continued to drive in the direction we first came.  There were no lights in the sky at this time in any direction.  We are not sure what we saw, but know that it was not normal for an object of that size to hover in one place.
