Approx 10-12 orange lights in a V-formation or triangle shape;2010-06-01 22:50:00;10 seconds;Approx 10-12 orange lights in a V-formation or triangle shape While driving E on I-44 at mile marker 148 at 22:50, we looked out the right window to the south and saw a V-formation of orange lights above the trees.  We asked each other if the other saw and we confirmed and looked back.  The V-shaped lights proceeded to move down behind the trees.  We exited and looped back to try and see the lights/object again but there was nothing to be seen.   We were by Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri but they have few aircraft and a large V-shaped orange light display has never been witnessed by us before.  Not sure what we witnessed but it was definitely something, whether military or not we are not sure.  It was a perfectly clear night with no clouds, lightning, or other distractions.  Temperature was in the upper 70's.;37.7676;-92.2105
