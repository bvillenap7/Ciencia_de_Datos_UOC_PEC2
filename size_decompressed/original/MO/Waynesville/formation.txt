While driving on I-44, just past Fort Leonard Wood area.  Saw them first in front, somewhat bright, not round-more flattened, about 1/2 mile ahead.   Then shortly right above and in front of car, moving slowly then to right of car, then over top (visible in windshield), then moved over to left.  Lights were in formation, slowly rotating, about 10-20 yards from car, keeping up with us at 60 mph.  Then went over car, not seen leaving over back. Observed time in distance about 20 seconds.  Time right over car was about 1:15 minutes to 1:30. This was 2 AM, cloudy skies had been raining earlier in day.  Very light traffic, one truck about 1/2 mile back. No object was visible, only the lights.  Maybe a drone?;37.7676;-92.2105
