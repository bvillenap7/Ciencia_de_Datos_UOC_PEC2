Orange Spheres and strange activity in the sky;2004-02-10 19:00:00;15 min;Orange Spheres and strange activity in the sky My Younger Brother and I Where driving on Champion springs Ranch road on the evening of the 02/10/04 around 7 p.m. CMT. It is a gravel road that runs off of Highway K Near the Black River.  We reached the top of the Hill and we saw five very brightly Shinging orange sphere's in the sky, at first they shot around like the balls that shoot out of Roman candle fireworks.  They then began to fly in V formation like a flock of geese this was a wooded area and at times the light from the spheres would shine accross the tops of the tree's.  After the spheres vanished I saw several blinking  lighs in the sky that looked like airplanes then I heard very loud booms in the sky, like a sonic boom.  I later spoke to the owner of Champion springs ranch and she told me she saw the sphere's as well and that she had saw them on other occasions.;37.4007;-90.6685
