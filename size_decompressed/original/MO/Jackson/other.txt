At approximately 18:15 a star caught my eye in the northeastern sky, but although it had a solid white light I began thinking it must be an aircraft because it was moving toward the southwest at the speed of the jets we normally see.  Since it looked like a normal star yet moved at the speed of a jet with a sold light I continued to watch it until moments later it stopped, moved slightly to the left (west) and then slowly moved as if it was positioning itself where it remained throughout the night to become the brightest star in our sky.   As I watched it periodically throughout the night it remained as a normal star.  Note we had very heavy chemtrails today and also there were electromagnetic pulse-looking things going across the United States from the northeast toward the southwest on weather radar at the same time I observed this.;37.3865999999999;-89.6530000000001
