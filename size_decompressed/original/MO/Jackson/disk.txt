It was a black disk that rotated in the air. At some points was a complete black sphere. The sunlight at one point shined off the object,and it appeared to be metallic. The object slowly moved from west to east, and eventually disappeared into the clouds. I have never seen anything like it. I am certain it was a UFO, and it was extremely weird!!!
