My husband & I were only dating then. We'd come back to my home to call it a evening and was sitting in the car in the drive. I knew the area well as I'd grown up in the same home. An empty field about 1 acre size joined our yard and at the S.E. corner was a huge cottonwood tree guessing around 80 - 100 years old ( a big tree) and just above the tree was a florecent (glowing) orange light the shape of a door. We could not see any beam, it was as though it was the light within whatever it was. Never seen light that color before or since. No actual craft shape could be seen, but the light never moved and could not hear any sound. I first seen it, almost like in a daze looking up at it, then like I came to and pulled away from my husband and said look. We both looked up and we both looked at one another and looked back up and it was gone. As strange as what we saw, was also the way we both felt afterwards. We were both so tired, I went straight into the house and to bed, unlike me to do, and now husband, could'nt even make it back to his home, stopping a few miles down the highway stopping at a rock quary and sleeping in his car. Not normal. We both felt as though something may have happened to us but don't know what or how we'd ever know. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.77079375;-94.8323337500001
6/7/2008 mysterious light sighting in St. Joseph, MO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Internation Space Station confirmed.  PD));2008-06-07 21:45:00;2-3 minutes;6/7/2008 mysterious light sighting in St. Joseph, MO I left my home at about 9:45 PM to work my night shift job when I happened to see a quite bright yellowish-white light cross the sky. It didn't move incredibly slowly, but it wasn't going super-fast, either. I would guess that from horizon to horizon it could've spanned the sky within 3-4 minutes, maybe 5. I could tell that the object/light was very high in altitude and had no flashing lights (as a plane or helicopter would) or have a trail (as a meteor would) but slowly moved across the sky in a straight line. It made no sound I could hear, though I live in the city and street noise might possibly drown out any sound it could have made. My girlfriend was with me, and we stood outside and watched the object until it was out of sight, for approximately 2-3 minutes. The object moved from slightly SW to the NE -- as I watched it, I was facing south, and my job is east of where I live so I was able to try to triangulate a little bit of its direction. When we got into the car and headed east to my job, the object had already left our visibility, and looking for it in the sky over the +/-2 miles to work neither me nor my girlfriend were able to spot it again. I did not, like some other reports of this particular sighting on this date, see said object fly off at a high rate of speed. However, if it did so that would explain why I couldn't see it while driving to work. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Internation Space Station confirmed.
