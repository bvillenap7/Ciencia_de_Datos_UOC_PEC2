Bright orange lines that turned into balloon looking objects;2012-03-12 21:00:00;20 minutes (approx.);Bright orange lines that turned into balloon looking objects As I was closing the back door, I saw the two bright stars.  As I looked at them I also saw two bright orange lights like lines in the sky in the west moving to the east.  The orange lines appeared to be the size of large planes but had bright orange liights on the bottome of the plane from the nose to the tail.  I watched them as they came closed.  As they got almost overhead, the left one started disappearing but the right one (north side) turned into a large bubble or balloon.  I watched it go down as I looked to the northwest.  I could see it through the branches of a big tree.  I stood in amazement thinking I had seen a UFO.  Then in the west there was two more of the long orange lines.  Again I watched them.  The one on the right started going over my house and the one on the left turned into a big balloon.  I watched it go down as it disappeared on the other side of the house next door to me.  I'm sure it was much farther away but looked closer.  I di! d not hear any sounds that sounded like an airplane going over.  The orange lights were very bright.  I've looked several more times but have not seen any more.;39.77079375;-94.8323337500001
