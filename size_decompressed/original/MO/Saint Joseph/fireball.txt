They looked like fireballs in that they glowed an amber color and varied in light output, similar to a candle or such.   The last object seen followed the other in the same flight path and I got a better look at it.   Directly overhead it seemed to have a point source and also a halo of fire that extended out more than would be expected from reflection of the sun off an airplane.   It seemed more like an object entering the atmosphere, like an asteroid, but without the tail and following a flight path??;39.77079375;-94.8323337500001
