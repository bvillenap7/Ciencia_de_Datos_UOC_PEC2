multiple color UFO's over St. Joseph, MO;2011-05-31 23:00:00;1 minute;multiple color UFO's over St. Joseph, MO Me and my dad were looking at the stars laying on the ground.  We then saw a circle UFO travelling at a high rate of speed.  It was circle shaped and was blinking from red to green to white. It moved across the sky very fast and changed directions.  We saw a total of four crafts all were similar in their blinking colors.  We are not sure itâ€™s a UFO but everything it did was the same as the from NASA website videos describing UFOs;39.77079375;-94.8323337500001
