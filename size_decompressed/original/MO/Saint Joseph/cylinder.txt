Floating gray cylinder seen dropping down behind some trees;2006-05-18 13:35:00;10 seconds;Floating gray cylinder seen dropping down behind some trees I was sitting in the parking lot of a local grocery store waiting for a friend when I looked up in the sky and saw something shaped like a soda can floating around horizontally.  It was grayish-silver in color.  From my position it was about 40-45 degrees up and about the size of a business card held at arms length.  I heard no noise from it.  It then sunk very rapidly behind some trees still in a horizontal position.  About this time my friend returned and I told her about it.  We drove over to where I saw it drop down (about a mile away) but found nothing.;39.77079375;-94.8323337500001
