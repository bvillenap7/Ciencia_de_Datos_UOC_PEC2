Triangular craft with white light and blinking red lights hovering over field in thunderstorm.;2010-05-12 10:07:00;20-30 sec;Triangular craft with white light and blinking red lights hovering over field in thunderstorm. I was on my way NW into St. Joseph on Hwy 169 last night in the remains of a thunderstorm.  It was still raining, but not hard.  There was a lot of lightning, mostly to the south of me.  I was following a semi-truck (cattle trailer), but was a good 15 car lengths behind him.  After passing the blacktop turn-off of E Hwy, I noticed a vehicle in the sky to my left, headed diagonally toward me.  I saw a large white light in the center or nose and smaller red blinking lights on either side.  Since the object was moving either very slowly or hovering, I rolled down my driver's side window and drove slowly by.  The object turned away from the highway, facing SW.  Lightning illuminate the dark backside of the craft, and I saw the V shape.  I kept driving, thinking there would be no reason for an airplane or helicopter to be out in this weather in the middle of the countryside, besides, it was NOT an airplane or helicopter.  It was larger than a helicopter and was hovering or moving very slowly at maybe 300 - 400 feet off the ground.;39.77079375;-94.8323337500001
