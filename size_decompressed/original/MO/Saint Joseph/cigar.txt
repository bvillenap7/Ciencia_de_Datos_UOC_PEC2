Two silent black cigar-shaped objects moving very slowly above the treeline just off the Belt Highway.;2015-11-19 01:10:00;5 seconds +;Two silent black cigar-shaped objects moving very slowly above the treeline just off the Belt While traveling on an unlit road toward the Belt Highway at 1:00, two dark forms slowly crossed the road just above the tree line.  The rate of speed was slow enough that the objects, moving perpendicular in relation to the vehicle, took more than 5 seconds to traverse the 2-lane road before disappearing behind the trees.   They were rectangular or cigar-shaped, and were completely silent as they moved.  From a distance, the objects looked as if a slight gray haze surrounded them, but as we approached, it became clear that they were solid and much darker black than the clear night sky around them.  Our car headlights may have caused the haze effect.   Both objects moved at the same rate of speed and in such a tight formation that the two forms might have actually been two volumes joined together in some way.
