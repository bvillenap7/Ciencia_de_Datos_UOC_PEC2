It was stationary for a good 2 minutes, as we drove up Messanie.   Dropped her off and drove two blocks east to get a be look.  Then It was now moving west and another small but brighter light appeared on the North side and quickly moved toward the object crossing paths and disappeared as it passed it.   The oblong object continued west for a short distance and was no longer visible.   Called a friend as I was looking at it but my phone wouldn't dial.   I took a photo with my phone but it is not visible on the picture.;39.77079375;-94.8323337500001
