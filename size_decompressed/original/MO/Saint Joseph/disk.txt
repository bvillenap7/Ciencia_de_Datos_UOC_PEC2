Saint Joseph;2011-07-04 22:38:00;20 min;SAINT JOSEPH Driving home from Kansas City about 5 minutes from home we saw the first object just hovering over a neighborhood.  Very different from the fireworks going on tonight.  A steady orange color about 5 or 6ft in diameter given the altitude of about 500ft.  I was visible for several minutes as we passed on the highway.  Once home we saw 5 more orange lights appear in the eastern sky one after the other and pass over our house, in a extremely straight line and very fast moving west toward Rosecrans airport/139th Airwing base.    Three directly east and two from the Northeast toward the same westerly point.  As they passed over our house you could clearly see the underside was not illuminated with the same orange color and it appeared to be a reflective disc object at least a 1,000 feet up.  There was no sound, no blinking lights.  Once they passed over they were no longer visible.   Myself, my husband and three children witnessed this event. In the distance you could see an airplane with its blinking lights.  This was very visible and very unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above to reflect an evening sighting.
