“Plane” with no wings turns into saucer then vanishes;2020-10-09 22:00:00;30-40 seconds;“Plane” with no wings turns into saucer then vanishes Was at the trunk of my car and noticed a very low flying “plane” didn’t pay any attention to it until i realized it sounded like it was having mechanical problems. Looked at it again and seen two lights on the front and one underneath. I then turned back to my trunk to continue what I was doing. While doing so I realized the light was casting a shadow of my body in my trunk. I then turned around once more, it was directly above me at this point. I then realized it wasn’t a plane due to its lack of wings. So I assumed it was a helicopter. Well I continued to watch it’s flight path as it flew over head of me. Not only did it have a curved flight path but it then transformed from a wingless plane, into what I will call a saucer. It looked as if it hit a wall and completely flattened out. After it had “flattened”, it didn’t necessarily vanish but I seen the way it was heading and it had completely vanished;37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
