Bright Green Oval shaped  UFO spotted.;2003-09-04 03:05:00;7 sec;Bright Green Oval shaped  UFO spotted. I was going outside to go look at Mars. I was looking towards the Northwest when I saw the object when It was a bright green light shaped like an oval,  moving from left to right. the Object didn't emit any sound.   I couldn't see it clearly because a big oak tree was blocking my view.   It was moving at a moderate pace, and appeared to be at least 150 feet up in the air.  I was standing about 300 feet.  It was it the sky at about a 70 degree angle from the ground, and it was gaining altitude.  Then suddenly I saw sparks emitting from the bright green object and it lost altitudes, and disappeared behind the hill/herizon. I heard dogs barking like crazy after I regain my composure, and could focus all of my senses.  I have seen UFO's before, but I was 10 the first time, and 18 the second time.  I am 25 years old.  and this is my first report. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) It really didn't go in a 90' degree angle  I believe I said it was  a 70 degree angle when I saw it.  It climbed gradually from an 75 degree then to an 80 degree, then it gradually lost degrees,  that is when I saw the sparks.  Then it disappeared behind the hill.  I thought it might have crashed but I didn't hear any noise.   The next day, my neighbor and I took a walk in the woods behind her house, but we think it may have landed or went over the neighbors property.  I also forgot to tell you about the size.  I would say it was  double the size of the north star. ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Illinois for the same time and date.  PD));37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
Red and orange light appeared to cruise steadily, then rapidly ascend at an angle and disappear.;2017-03-20 20:27:00;8-15 seconds;Red and orange light appeared to cruise steadily, then rapidly ascend at an angle and disappear. I was sitting on my front porch swing.  Two neighbors were walking by on the sidewalk.  I saw a red and orange, somewhat blurry, but brighter in the center, oval shape drop a little from the northeast, and then appear to “cruise” at the same altitude.   I heard a low humming noise.   I asked the neighbors, “Do you see that?  What is that?”  They stopped and looked up and saw it, too.  It seemed at first to be “cruising” at a constant speed,  and then abruptly changed direction, and within seconds disappeared at an angle toward the stars.  I think the most unique thing about it was the rapid escalation up into the night sky that just took seconds.  (My father worked for USGS).  ((sic.  USCG));37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
Red and orange, fuzzy oval shape 'cruised' through sky, then made a very rapid ascent and disappeared.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-20 20:27:00;13 seconds;Red and orange, fuzzy oval shape 'cruised' through sky, then made a very rapid ascent and disappeared in a couple seconds. I saw one blurry orange and red, somewhat oval shape, fairly low in the sky, slowly approach from the northeast.  I heard a soft, hum like engine.  The shape moved across the sky at the same altitude and then it rapidly, more rapidly than I have ever seen anything ascend, went up into the sky at an angle and disappeared in maybe 2 to 4 seconds.
