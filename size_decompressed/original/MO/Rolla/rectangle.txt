Rectangular, lights on corners and multiple other lights, white and red in the early morning.;2015-02-10 05:30:00;10 seconds;Rectangular, lights on corners and multiple other lights, white and red in the early morning. Trying to sleep in my van, I noticed it just above tree level at the house across the street.  It had no sound.  It had a light on each bottom corner, but also many smaller lights in an apparent pattern most white, a few red.  As soon as I noticed it, it began to quickly move my direction.  I went into a type of (what felt like) sleep paralysis and blacked out, despite my best efforts.   I awoke about 30 minutes later.  It was gone.  A terrifying experience.  I am sorry I did not record the exact date. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
