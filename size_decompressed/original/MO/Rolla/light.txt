Strange yellowish lights seen southeast of Rolla, Missouri;1984-01-26 19:30:00;1-2 Minutes;Strange yellowish lights seen southeast of Rolla, Missouri I wish to confirm the sightings of lights seen by the woman in Salem Missouri.  I too saw three or four yellowish colored lights that night.  They appeared in the low sky I thought they were street lights until I realized they were too far away and too high in elevation from my vantage point to be street lights. I am familiar with most of the lights in the area around my house, and those seemed out of place.  They were almost to my souteast as I looked from my window on the south side of my house. They did not appear to be moving, but were stationary. I wish I'd known about this website earlier, as I would have sent you a note. Nevertheless, that's what I saw. There is an Army base close to here (Ft.LeonardWood), and they may have had some slow moving aircraft inbound. I didn't really think about it(except the non-moving appearance and the Military aircraft in the aerea didn't add up) alot until I saw the note from Salem describing something very similar.

bright orange lights associated with aircraft.;2001-08-20 21:33:00;18 min.;bright orange lights associated with aircraft. We traveled to the southwest side of Rolla to watch the International Space Station pass over from the southwest. We knew that the shuttle would be nearby. About 9:32pm, just before we saw the two orbiting vehicles come into view, a bright orange light flared to our SSW about 10 degrees elevation. It lasted about 3 seconds and went out. These lights continued to come on and off for 3-5 seconds at a time for about 18 minutes. They ended promptly at 9:50 pm. With me was my wife and teenage son. My wife had binoculars in the car, and with them I could see very faint strobes literally swarming in the area where the lights appeared and disappeared. As many as three bright orange lights might appear at once, but there were probably as many as five different sources.  Attempting to follow or count very faint strobes in binoculars is not easy, but it appeared that as many as five different strobe sources were present as well. The brightness difference between the stobes and the orange flares was extreme enough that I couldn't tell if it was the strobing crafts that became brilliant or if the source was just very close by.  I enjoy stargazing as a hobby and am familiar with varied phenomenon of the night sky. The appearance of the bright orange lights was in color like that of Mars, which was close by this evening for comparison, but with the brightness of Venus, about 1 to -1 magnitude in range.  The area would be towards the south side of the Army base Fort Leonard Wood, or could have been even further southwest. There was no practical way to triangulate for a proper distance.;37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
Pink anomali and the  red pulsing light;2001-10-28 00:30:00;10 minutes;Pink anomali and the  red pulsing light I joined my friend outside while he was having a smoke. His house sets on a little hill overlooking a small town 5 miles north. We stood on his concrete basketball court and fratenized in the cool missouri air. I looked to my east, northeast,above the horizon was a pink, wispy, cloud superimposed on the blue night. It was like a light but not, it was like a paintbrush stroke but not.  It was large, i estimate it to be around the size of 30 full moons, speaking of the moon it was directly opposite the pink anomali. As any young 21 year old of average intelligence might gather, this must be the northern lights. It was beautiful  whatever it was and it held our full attetion for its duration. But here's the clincher about 3 minutes into the sighting a red pulsing light caught our attetion, due north, toward the town. The light seemed to be between us and the town, but closer to the town of some 14,000. It was red, stoplight red,and its lights never toataly went out, but dimmed and brightened in a methodial pattern, bright 1000 dim 1000.i estimate its size at 1/10 the moons. As the round light, as i could make out no shape of a craft, moved east toward the wispy pink anomali they both seemed to slowly disappear. That was it and they where gone. Sound u ask. Yes we heard a sound even befor the sighting, we thought it was a jet overhead, but it seemed to linger, who knows if they're  connected.  I have no idea if the red pulsing light was connceted to the pink discoloration. I've had a couple more sightings, none this intresting. My friend can backup all this 100%. What an intresting world we live in. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the pink glow in the north may have been an example of the Northern Lights, also called the Aurora boreallis.  The red pulsing light may have been a strobe or Grimes Light on an aircraft.  PD));37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
Second sighting seen in less than 24 hours.;2003-07-16 20:40:00;20 minutes;Second sighting seen in less than 24 hours. I had seen a craft very close up no less than 24 hours ago. I decided to grab a camcorder, a digital camera, two walky talkies and a friend and return to the same spot that I had seen the craft the night before. At about 20:25 we began walking towards the area that I had seen the craft. We were in a large open field and I began looking towards the sky. There were no stars out, and the sun was going down. Soon I saw a small white dot far off in the distance. I showed it to my friend, and we sat and watched if it would move, thinking it might be a craft. It was moving slightly and soon blended into the sky. Then I noticed another odd thing in the sky, close to where the first craft had been. This one was much larger, possible closer than the first and it resembled a cloud or as if it was reflecting the sun's color. It was orange and did not move. We became aware it was not a cloud for the fact that it disappered. Now something was definitely strange about this part of the sky. We were still a bit hesitant to if we had seen anything out of the normal. Another white dot much resembling the first appeared under another cloud than the others, it soon disappered. So we knew something paranormal was happening and I started to search the sky for more objects. When suddenly, I looked directly above where me and my friend were sitting, it had a triangle shape on it, and a circlish-ovalish part on it. It was hovering and wasn't too far in the sky, definitely no star, which not one was in the sky. It started moving slowly away so I pulled the camcorder out of my backpack and recorded what I could of it before it completely disappeared. We packed our camera up and started heading back towards my friend's house where I had seen a craft the night before. I then noticed a rocket had appeared in the sky, it was probably military craft. I decided it was important to record this. Then, out of nowhere ANOTHER ROCKET appeared, this one had much stranger activity. I recorded them both. They were heading toward! s the same direction, where the first white dots were in the sky. The second craft either stopped, changed direction or was going really slow, because it was suspended in midair. Soon, it went behind a cloud. The only thing I recorded was the UFO that was hovering above us, and the two military rockets that were pursuing them or that just happened to be passing the area. From this second incident, I have decided to do more and more UFO hunting. I will report here if I see anything else during my huntings. If someone wants to see the footage I have please contact me at ((e-address deleted)) and I will be happy to show you it. If any private investigators need to contact me I would be much more comfortable to show them person to person, instead of telling the story again on the phone. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness, a student, to forward some still images of the object, and may request permission to post them.  PD));37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
My husband is a medical assistant in a doctors office and i am a stay at home mother of 3.;2008-06-23 23:00:00;10 -15 seconds;My husband and I were on our back porch having a ciggarette on either the 23rd or 24th of June at about 11 pm when I saw a shooting star , after that we started looking for more. a few minutes later we saw what looked like an ariplane in the sky. It was the same sixze, height, brightness and speed as an airplane. The light was white.We thought nothing of it until it started to get bright. It just got brighter and brighter until it was extremely bright, When the light got extremely bright it had a kind of haze around it like  bright headlights late at night.then immediately following it faded out until it dissapeared. The whole thing took probably only 10 or 15 seconds. My husband is a medical assistant in a doctors office and i am a stay at home mother of 3. The email address I provided belongs to my neighbor.

Star-like object with two faint blue lights moving together.;2011-08-28 02:00:00;5 minutes;Star-like object with two faint blue lights moving together. Was camping in rural central Missouri 20 miles South West of Rolla.  Around 2am I went outside our tent to use the restroom.  I was star gazing for a few moments and noticed one of the stars was moving slightly.  I rubbed my eyes and cleaned my glasses and watched for a good 5 minutes.  While intensely viewing the star I quickly began noticing two separate faint blue lights flashing in and out in an orbit like way around the star.   Yet, the slight movement of the start that that originally caught my eye was in fact darting towards each flash of faint blue light.  I witnessed this for several minutes before going back to the tent.  The star was extremely high in the sky, perhaps in space itself or the upper atmosphere.  For as high as the light objects were I believe that the slight movements the star made towards the blue lights must have been extremely fast, as it was moving back and forth, stopping, and then shifting toward another blue light repeate! dly.;37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
