object up in the stratosphere followed  with us for approximently 45 minutes;2007-08-12 01:19:00;45 min;object up in the stratosphere followed  with us for approximently 45 minutes I forgot about that, and went about my business watching the meteors and all, and still not much action.  I spot another plane but this one was different It had strobe lights on it, and was very high in the sky.  It seemed to go in a zig pattern too. Wasn't going to fast but wasn't going slow either not a nice steady pace like an airplane. Here is where its gets real interesting.  It veered off to make a sharp right and that is when i ran in the house and grab my phone and came back outside to call this hotline.  I went back outside and I could still see it.  I then went to get my camera and used my cell phone to take video but you can't see anything due to the craft being so high in the sky.  It even flew above me way up and I couldn't tell the shape of it.  The lights were white, red, blue, and I thought i even saw green lights too. The space craft made huge circles at least three times while I was out there.  Maybe it was considering making contact?  What is even more interesting was I saw the same craft the night before traveling near bland and belle missouri that happened about 9:29 pm. It had the same zig zag pattern, but was going a much faster pace.  I went back to see if I could spot the craft outside, but it looked like a storm moving in so I went back into the house.  I mean honestly who wants to be waken up in the middle of the night, by his wife? My husband dosen't.  I unfortunately was the only witness to it.;37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
Crafts flying over my house it seems like every night.;2007-10-05 23:32:00;6 min;Crafts flying over my house it seems like every night. I went to check on the dogs outside because they wouldn't quit barking.  I decided to sit outside and watch the stars.  I looked up and noticed a bright flashing craft coming towards my house it was north heading south as it was doing this it flew right over me and I could see it had circles flashing different colors.  It had to be flying about as high as a traffic helicopter would, but I heard no noise.   It then changed it's course heading east.  I watched it until it disappeared out of view, and then I decided to see if I could see anything else for a while.   About 5 minutes passed and then I saw what I assume is the same craft going west.  It was probably a quarter of a mile away, but judging by the same flash pattern.  I am pretty sure it is the same kind of craft I saw in August, that I reported here.  I have seen alot of interesting sightings.  Almost one a week it seems like.   Even two military Helicopters were flying tree top level over my house about two weeks ago.  I heard them from very far away, but didn't see them until they flew almost directly above me.   I also saw an unidentified craft heading in a south to north direction while the helicopters were flying west to east.;37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
Bright white, darting ball.;2014-08-16 21:45:00;15 minutes;Bright white, darting ball. I observed a bright white light falling, and suddenly stopping.  The object then continued horizontally east, darting from left to right repeatedly. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, in order to confirm that the sighting occurred at night, and not in the morning.  We have changed the time above.  He apprised us that the object appeared to descend, then ascend again, as it was maneuvering in the sky.  The witness seemed to us to be quite sincere, and he sounded serious-minded to us.

undescribed pulsating red lights moving in formation.;2017-12-09 20:30:00;35-45 minutes;undescribed pulsating red lights moving in formation 8:30 p.m. CST 9 December 2017, Rolla, Missouri 65401   	looking south to southeast, at first there were 3-4 red pulsating lights in the night sky, flying in a swooping arc formation.  Moving southeast.    Called witness number 1 to come outside to look and see what I saw.  And said that is was probably airplanes in the distance.  Went inside for about 15 minutes.   Then returned outside and saw an additional 20-40 red lights in the same formation moving at an abnormally slow speed.   Called witness 1 back outside and saw the same thing but more pronounced.   Witness 3 came outside to see what the commotion was.  Witness 3 saw exactly what the first 2 witnesses saw.  But at a delayed time.  There were no flashing lights to accompany the red lights as there are with normal aircraft.  Or satellite.   Witness number 1 called the UFO eyewitness hotline to report the incident, and was asked to make an official report online.;37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
