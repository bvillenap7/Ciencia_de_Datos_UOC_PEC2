Two objects, each a set of triangular lights, moving due East at 20:50 on 4/16/07 in Rolla, Missouri.;2007-04-16 20:50:00;45 seconds;Two objects, each a set of triangular lights, moving due East at 20:50 on 4/16/07 in Rolla, Missouri. (N97.56.616 W91.45.873) I was in my front yard observing iridium flares, having just watched one flash at 28 degrees Alt. and 354 degrees Azimuth when one in the party whose attention I was directing said look, the big dipper.  As I averted my attention toward the dipper at her response, I could see what appeared to be two objects passing West to East.  Each object was a triangular arrangement of lights white in color, not blinking, and about second magnitude.  They passed very near Mizar and Alcor, the southernmost object within a degree north.   The separation of the base lights of the triangle shape was almost equal to these previously mentioned stars, with the forward light about twice that separation.  Each object was about 4 degrees apart on a north-south line, and maintained that arrangement during the 45 seconds of observation.  They became too faint to track as they passed from 25 Boo to 36 Boo in Bootes.  There were no associated sounds.  I am an amateur astronomer, 50 years old.  The other observer was my wife, who realized the significance of the sighting and drew a diagram independently to compare to mine for accuracy.  Others present could not find the objects until the objects were nearly gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, shortly after his sighting, and we found him to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he probably is an exceptionally good witness.

Large triangle craft flies over my house, loud;2011-03-09 23:30:00;1 hour;Large triangle craft flies over my house, loud It was approximately 11:28p.m. on March 09, 2011  I was inside my house playing WII that I heard a loud engine of some kind,  and it sounded like an aircraft.  I walked outside didnâ€™t see anything but heard it.  I walked down my front  porch and into my yard  and looked over and in the distance saw and  thought it was one of those dual helicopters that have two propellers and it was flying west from a south easterly direction.   So I thought no big deal, and went back inside.  5 minutes later I hear d a sound of a louder lower something.  So I went outside expecting another helicopter and looked up and saw a triangular craft.   It had one green light on one tip, a red light on another tip, and white light on another tip,  and somewhere on the outer rim was a red light which I assume was the cockpit.  It flew over at 11:31 central time.  It was flying low.  I went back inside thinking I had seen the last of it, and it proceeded to fly over my house, an additio! nal 5 times.    At one point I watched it fly up near a commercial craft high up in the sky, and it was at least 10 times bigger than the craft from my vantage point.   I was on the phone with the Highway Patrol seeing if they could get a patrolman out on Hwy 72 to see this thing.  The last time I saw it it was going back east and following a large what I thought was a helicopter with a huge red light,  back towards Salem.  I watched this thing for an hour.  It was dark metallic, and loud;37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
