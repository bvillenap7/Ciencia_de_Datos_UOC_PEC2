Bright White Light  slowly moving across the sky;2008-05-20 21:23:00;5 minutes;Bright White Light  slowly moving across the sky A  friend and I were driving southeast bound on Hwy 72 towards Salem when I looked up and saw what appeared to be a  very big  bright star that appeared to be moving.  It was flying at an altitude of what a commercial plane would be and it was headed in an easterly direction.  It was flying in a straight forward manner.  The object had no blinking lights it was just a contstant white  bright light.  As it got further away from us it seemed to dim down almost to nothing where you could barely see it anymore, but it still was not so  far away where you could not totally tell where it was.  We tracked the object for about 5 minutes before it dimmed down.  There were other vehicles were on the road at this time, but none of them stopped to watch.  This happened about 21:23 hours on May 20th, 2008.  I am a college student that has numerous sighting around this area for quite some time.  And she is a high school graduate;37.9477851851852;-91.7637370370371
