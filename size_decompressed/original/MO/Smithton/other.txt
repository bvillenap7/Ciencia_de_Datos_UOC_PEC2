grey and white hovering Y shape;2000-11-01 13:40:00;<30 seconds;grey and white hovering Y shape I am an Inspector for the ((name and type of organization deleted)).  While driving to work today, I observed something I was unable to identify.  I was westbound on Hwy. 50, approximately 8-10 miles from Sedalia.  This would be the vicinity of Smithton, MO.  I noticed a shape in the sky ahead of me.  Clouds had just moved into the area and it had sprinkled rain.  The shape was over an open field to the South of the highway by approximately 100 feet.  I noticed a grey shape just a little darker than the clouds and no movement to it.  It appeared to hover.  I was driving at or about the speed limit of 60 m.p.h. and observed the object for a total of possibly 15 seconds.  The color wasn't a shiny metallic, but seemed to be shades of white and grey.  The shape of the object was that of a 'Y'.  There was a fuselage and a wing coming off each (back?) side in the slanted position.  I saw no propellors, rotors, or 'engine' type parts.  It seemed to be somewhat larger than an ultralite, about the size of a small plane.  The object appeared to hover, as I could detect no movement. This area is approximately 15 miles WSW of Whitman Air Force Base in Knob Noster, MO. A co-worker who drives in from the West told me he saw a black helicopter hovering just before he got to work. Our work place is roughly halfway between my sighting area and the AFB.  There is also an airport for small aircraft in the area. This was not any airplane I have ever seen (and I have seen many of all types). ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.  We wonder whether the witness may have observed a type of experimental aircraft known as a VariEasy, or a VariViggen, designed by Burt Rutan.  They are very unusual in appearance, particularly to someone who has never seen one.  PD));38.6607;-93.1115
