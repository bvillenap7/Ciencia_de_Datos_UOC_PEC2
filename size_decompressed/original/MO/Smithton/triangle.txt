Hovering Triangles and Lights in Smithton;2013-04-30 21:40:00;60 minutes;Hovering Triangles and Lights in Smithton Tonight my husband and I were sitting on the front porch. We can hear a roaring but sounds very low.  He says to look at the three planes flying above us. I get up and look and they get closer and closer.  Turns out it was not planes at all it was a set of 3 triangular shaped objects.  They stopped and hovered over the house then took off. I watched them go behind the church which is across the street.   I went to look for it with no success. Then, as me and my girls were walking back from trying to find the objects, we see ahead in the trees a big green flash.  We start running towards the object and it hovers above us and it is simply two round lights that changed from green to white.  The craft was probably about 50 ft above us and we could see it clear.  Then, it takes off as if it flew away.  This was not the end however. Next, we saw several more triangle shapes flying above the house.  Then, a huge fireball falls out of the sky and heads toward the neighbors house.  After this, another triangle shape is hovering above the street light.  We walk to it to see if we can figure it out ..keep in mind this is my husband, daughters, and neighbor girls.  As we get closer this triangle shape is just a little above the street light it comes closer and hovers over us and it had red lights around it.  As we got closer it started coming down toward us and a white light lit up. We all got scared and ran off back to the house.  Then the three triangle shapes flew back over the house again and did a circle in the sky and darted off.  I know this story sounds out there, but there were plenty of witnesses.  I felt like I needed to call someone, just not sure who or where to turn.  Thanks for reading!;38.6607;-93.1115
