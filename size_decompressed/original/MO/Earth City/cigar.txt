MANY PEOPLE REPORTED  THIS THEN IT WAS HUSHED UP;1997-07-04 20:00:00;5 seconds;MANY PEOPLE REPORTED  THIS THEN IT WAS HUSHED UP IN THE EARLY EVENING ON 7/04/97, MY SISTER, HER HUSBAND, MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF ALL WENT TO WATCH FIRE WORKS IN BRIDGETON, MO. (ST LOUIS) OR (ST CHARLES AREA).   WE WERE STANDING IN THE EARTH CITY AREA DIRECTLY ON NEW HWY 370 TO OBSERVE THE FIREWORKS.  IT WAS AROUND DUSK.  THE FIREWORKS HAD STARTED FAR OFF BUT NOT AT THE ONE CLOSEST TO US.  MY HUSBAND BENT DOWN TO TIE HIS SHOE.  AS HE DID THIS THE OTHER 3 OF US ALL LOOKED UP AT THE SAME TIME......  WHAT I WATCHED LASTED ABOUT 5 SECONDS, NO MORE..... THE SHAPE WAS OVAL-SHAPED TO ALMOST CIGAR SHAPED....THE COLOR WAS BRILLIANT, SO VIVID THAT THE COLOR WAS ALMOST TOUGH TO DESCRIBE, UNLIKE  ANY COLOR THAT I  AM FAMILIAR WITH, THE CLOSEST I COULD SAY WAS BRIGHT ROYAL BLUE TO PURPLISH COLOR.   IT APPEARED TO FLOAT STILL, FOR JUST A SECOND, THEN MOVED SLOWLY HORIZONTAL, THEN SUDDENLY FLEW VERTICALLY STRAIGHT UP AND THEN JUST VANISHED.   THE WHOLE INCIDENT LASTED NO MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS.  I HEARD NO SOUNDS FROM THE FLYING OBJECT.  I DON’T THINK I WOULD SOON FORGET WHAT WE SAW. IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS I LOOKED AROUND THE AREA TO MY REALIZATION THAT OTHERS HAD ALSO SEEN WHAT WE HAD.  MANY OTHER FIREWORK VIEWERS APPEARED STUNNED.  WE ALL SAID, DID YOU SEE THAT?   ALL  AGREED.   YES, MY HUSBAND MISSED THE WHOLE INCIDENT, BY TYING HIS SHOE. THIS SHOWS THE QUICKNESS OF THE ENTIRE EVENT. I HEARD AND SAW IN THE LOCAL NEWS AND NEWSPAPERS MANY REPORTS OF SIMILAR SIGHTINGS AND NOT ONLY IN THE MISSOURI AREA.  ALL OVER AMERICA AND BEYOND, ON THIS SAME EVENING. MY SISTER HAD A FRIEND AT THE TIME, WHO WORKED AT ONE OF THE LARGER ST LOUIS NEW PAPERS AND HAD MADE A STATEMENT TO HER THAT THERE HAD BEEN MANY SUITS  VISITING SUDDENLY AT THE OFFICES OF THE PAPER RECENTLY, IN BIG, BIG, VERY SECRET MEETINGS WITH MUCH GUARDING GOING ON, OF THAT MEETING.  WE NOTICED AFTER THAT.  WHAT WAS BIG FRONT PAGE NEWS ABOUT THIS UFO WAS SUDDENLY SLIPPED TO THE LAST PAGE WITH ONLY A TINY STATEMENT, THEN  JUST AS SUDDEN POOF, NEVER HEARD ABOUT IT AGAIN. MAKES ME WONDER WHY THEY DON’T WANT US TO BE INFORMED. I FIND IT SO STRANGE THAT WE HAVE THIS MUCH INFORMATION AT OUR FINGERTIPS YET STILL..  DO WE REALLY KNOW ANY MORE THAN WE EVER HAVE?  IT'S HERE.  I REALLY THINK SO!;38.7689;-90.4613
