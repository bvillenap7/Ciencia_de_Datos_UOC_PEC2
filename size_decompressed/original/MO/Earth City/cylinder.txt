Keep in mind, this is not too far from Lambert Airport so seeing airplanes in the sky is an everyday all-day experience. However, this was no airplane at all. I had just merged from 270 on to 70w and with Earth City being the first exit on the right side of 70w after merging off 270, I was approaching with my exit in view. I looked up due to the glare from the sun, I thought it was another airplane that I would see almost every day, but this was different, as I approached Earth City, I was getting closer to the single object & it looked like it was just sitting mid-air. For a moment, I thought I was seeing things.  The object seemed high in the sky like an airplane would however it was long and skinny almost stick like. It was white in color almost like the color of clouds. The closer I got, the more I realized this was not normal. It was not a plane or a “stick Shaped Cloud” It was shaped more ! like a cylinder. Right before my eyes, I watched it go from completely still, move backwards then forward & gone in less than three seconds. Everything happened so extremely fast! Though I was blocks from my job location, I had pull over at the fuel station to gather myself.  I know what I saw, it was not an airplane nor a drone. It was not a glare, flare, or meteor. .  the sun is out today the sky is blue not many clouds are in the sky.  What I saw was something other worldly or some way advanced government secret. Either way, it has been two hours since this happened & I’m still shook by what I saw.;38.7689;-90.4613
