Hi. Top of the day too you. I have been keeping these stories to myself for a long time.;1994-06-15 22:00:00;1:oo min;Hi. Top of the day too you. I have been keeping these stories to myself for a long time. I think the time is right to tell someone.I have two stories that happend years apart. The first time I saw what I think was a UFO, To tell the truth I dont know what it was  but reports on the news and pictures made me rethink what i had seen. The first  time I was camping with friends for the weekend. It had gotten late and we all went  into our tents. I came back outside my tent to, Well you know. Anyway while I was  doing that I happend to look to my left and I saw three bright white lights.The lights  looked like a triangle.one light on top and two at the bottom. They looked to be a  mile or so away. So I thought it must be someone with lights on a  hill but the next  morning I looked in the direction that I saw the lights and the ground was flat for as  far as you could see. The lights were in a vertical position. So its no way it could  have been lights on a hill. Case number two, It was midday about six years ago my wife and I was on our way in the house. I looked up and saw what I thought was a balloon, It was silver But then I thought the wind was blowing and the object was not moving. I called too my wife to look. She asked me What is that I said I dont know when we looked agin it was gone. Like I said it was silver and round mybe a little oval but more round. I almost forgot...I'm from Saint Louis Mo.

The object looked like a triangular shaped solid welder's arc.;1996-07-09 23:30:00;30 minutes;The object looked like a triangular shaped solid welder's arc. Three years ago my brother and I observed a triangular shaped object in clouds of the type Altocumulus over St. Louis City.  The object was as bright as a welder's arc, and remained stationary for almost half an hour. Occasionally the object would disappear, and reappear in the exact spot. The clouds surrounding the object had dozens of lights swimming through them.  The lights looked like the end of a Hollywood searchlight, were not coming from the ground, and seemed to be inside the clouds.  The lights followed the boundaries of the clouds, and when they would travel from one cloud to the next, the would disappear until they reached the next cloud. These lights darted about like fish in water, and seemed to have some sort of repetitive pattern to their movement. We called the St. Louis Police Department and several news stations, but the incident was brushed off as probably just lights coming from the airport. Well, the airport is 25 miles from the location at which we observed the object and lights, and we could not imagine how the airport could have been beaming lights of this nature to this location.  Nor would it explain the triangular shaped object, which appeared and disappeared in the same spot in the sky several times in the half hour we watched it.  This object was not a faint glow, it was extrememly distinct and bright. I have included an animated rendering of what we saw in an e-mail I sent to you.  To save file size, I did not include as many lights as we actually observed.  In truth, the entire cloud covering was saturated with these swimming lights.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

I was sitting at a stop light at Forest Park Parkway and Big Bend, (University City) facing west, just looking up at the beautiful blue sky and clouds. Suddenly there was a flash of light in the direction I was watching and a triangular object appeared as if out of thin air.  I saw it long enough to discern the shape, but not much of anything else.  It went into a cloud. I waited to see it reappear but it didnt.  I thought I had to have been mistaken...it was a plane.  But just about the time I was sure I had misidentified a plane, an airplane came into view at about the same area and altitude. The triangular object appeared to be about one third the size of the airplane.  It was easy to see these two objects were very different.  The plane's wings were visible as were the windows.  It was a dull grey color contrasted to the bright silver of the first object.  Both the object and plane headed in a northerly direction. The airplane came throguh the clouds.

The light was constant, and the movement was jerky and it went in a straight line. It made no sound but if it did it was way to high to hear it. I asked the girl i was with if she saw it and she replied , yea ... it was probally an airplane.. I have never seen or heard of an airplane that could move so fast without any sound. There were three lights all same distance apart, not changing intensity like a star moving together.  WOW, what a feeling! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous.

It appears to be triangle shaped - is green with a red flash every now and then.  It moves to left, moves to right and then seems to move forward. I have called an astrophysicist who teaches a class on the Universe and he said it's not a star - he's going to try to locate it himself and set up his telescope.   Tonight there seemed to be a circle with maybe 4 to 5 (it was hard to see) - all other nights (for the past 2 weeks) I only saw one object - it's VERY bright.  Tonight it looked like there were smaller objects circling around the larger brighter object.  That's about it - the most interesting part is that it moves from left to right and from right to left.

Large black fast moving triangular shaped aircraft rumbling across the sky.;2006-07-22 15:00:00;2 minutes;Large black fast moving triangular shaped aircraft rumbling across the sky. My husband and two year old were sitting outside on a lounge chair, when my husband yelled out my name, come quick, girls come quick. Within eight steps I was out my door, with three girls behind me.  I had heard the aircraft it was load!  Thinking I would see three fighter jets (which would have been typical, especially since we have the National Guard here cleaning up from the storms).  But when I looked up it was a black triangular shaped aircraft where it was wide in shape with two of the points being squared off, and completing the triangle.  I ran fast to the end of the drive pointing it out to my three daughters but it moved so quickly and then disappeared through the clouds.  As we discussed what we had just seen some answers maybe Boeing has a new craft-possilby gearing up for a war?  My husband said maybe a UFO?  My husband explains while sitting there with our two year old he heard it coming and felt it, it rumbled as it went over him, when he realized it was something he had never seen he started to call us.  He said, I thought I'd ask you to grab your camera but I didn't want you to miss it, it was moving so fast. Seconds later we heard another aircraft off in the distance, like a 747 airplane, not sure if it was following.  Couldn't see it but heard it once the sound of the first aircraft was gone.

It had orangeish crimson lights at its points and it was a black middle section. I was slowly moving towards where i live and all the cats in my house came into the same room i was in  (all 5) and i held one up to the window as it was hovering over my house and the faint humming sound from the craft was gone. I was on the phone with a relative who was 5 miles away telling him about it on my cell phone, the phone was making weird noises and the screen was static, and the radio in my bedroom was going rampid and alot of static and what sounded like the russian language being chirped (like a bird would try to communicate in russian). THe thing hovered over and then all the electrical devices in my house were fine. My camera was experiencing static but there was a light shade of a humanoid in the background of it in static like an old black in white tv having bad reception.

THe ufo was a triangle and it tryed to abduct me and it happend before 8 years ago.;2007-07-13 21:33:00;6 minutes;THe ufo was a triangle and it tryed to abduct me and it happend before 8 years ago. The UFO appeared at 21:33 left at 21:39 and then returned exactly one hour later and left exactly one hour after the last time it left. It was a triangle shaped craft with lights on the tips of the triangle. The lights were a mix of these colors, red, maroon, orange and yellow. The body of the craft was black. It came from the west and was moving east. It was large, it was bigger than any airplane or I had ever seen and it made a small humming noise. The size of the craft would have been he size of a baseball field. The craft was able to distort radio waves and cell phone frequencies. It caused a lot of static on radios and on my cell phone. There were chirping noises coming from my radio in the static. My cell phone had a lot of static. I was on the phone with a family member telling him about it and he may have seen it. It was able to mess with any electrical appliances that were left on. It had my watch on my hand going off the fritz. The second hand kept spinning forward and eventually stopped after it left. My camera even had static on it. I am mailing what I saw on the camera lcd screen. It looked like they were hailing me on my camera like on the show star trek. The weirdest part of the experience is the effect it had on my 5 cats. All five cats came into the room I was in. I even had one locked in my room and it opened the door to get out there. The cats circled me as I was gazing at the object. The object was slowly moving over my house and there was another flying object behind it and it was much smaller like a manmade aircraft chasing it. That aircraft did not make any sound and when it came close to the UFO it left for approximately one hour. I had sent in an earlier report and I mixed up the times by three hours. It happened at dark and the lights of the craft were the only things that could easily be seen. It was spinning clockwise the entire time and when it was hovering over the house. I tried to go outside but my cats would not let me. It came back an hour latter and the! same re sults with electrical devices were happening. I was on the phone with my girlfriend and it went static, I went out to the room and I saw the ufo coming from northwest going southwest towards my house it looked like it was going to collide and then it went invisible and the cats started hissing at something I could not even see in the room. There was a constant humming sound in the room until the cats hissed then it went away again and did not come back. This happened before in September 8 years ago on the 23. The same thing happened then. That was when I was 8 years old, half my life in the past. I think they were going to try and take me.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

We looked east toward the Mississippi River, the highway is about 70 feet above the river on a sloping bluff. We saw three lite blue lights at each point of a dark triangle box shaped air craft. The triangle shaped air craft was traveling north following at a height of about 500 feet above the Mississippi River at about 48 knots/hr.. The craft seemed to be following the the river, but then dipped slightly to it's right and turned north/east over the river and disappeared in the thick fog. There was no sound that we could hear. The triangle shaped craft seemed to just float in the fog like a gost ship at sea.  We seen the craft for only a duration of 10 sec., but it was real.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Two bright triangle lights outside my window;2008-06-10 00:00:00;8-10 minutes;Two bright triangle lights outside my window I lived in St. Louis from 1998-2009. In the summer of 2008, when I was 10 years old, I woke up to a very bright light shining through my bedroom window. When I went to look, I witnessed two objects that seemed to be the shape of equilateral triangles, but with rounded corners, hovering at about the same height as my window. We lived on the third floor of an apartment building at the time, so they were about 30-40 feet off the ground. The light was bright enough to see the different colors of the bricks on the next building.  The objects kind of bobbed in the air like they were floating in water for about 8-10 minutes, then vanished. It appeared more like lights being turned off than something flying away.  The event itself was not frightening, but I suffered from nightmares for several days after.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Metallic object, square/triangular shape, with blinking lights.;2008-10-26 23:17:00;1 1/2 hours;Metallic object, square/triangular shape, with blinking lights. On the night of October 26, 2008, my three buddies and I were on hall st. which is just north of st. Louis.  We were watching street races as I noticed this object just hovering there at the end of Hall St.  I told my buddy to look at it and he thought it was just a plane  because Lambert airport is near.  15 minutes later I told him to look again.  He said it was just a helicopter.  45 minutes later as we were leaving when the cops came, all cars scattered, that's when my buddy said that things still there. As we were driving down the road it started to move near where we were.  As it got closer it was about a football field high.  The craft appeared to be like a square/triangle and big, about the height of a one level house.  The length of about 50 yards.  It had three blinking red lights on the side, a blinking red light at the top, and a big spot light in the front. As this description sounds like an airplane, it wasn't. The craft was swaying back and forth as to where you can see the reflection of the metallic looking bottom look square.  I have a video of it. I had three people in my car that were going crazy.  The craft made no noise.  We left the pack of cars (which normally we wouldn't do), we jumped on the highway to follow the craft.  We were driving parallel with the craft.  You could see it clear as day.  It started  to veer off over highway 70 toward Illinois. We got off at the Bellfontaine exit and made a right.  The object was on the western side of us starting to travel quickly and we were following it for about 3 miles, then the object disappeared.  All four of us were freaking out cause this was no  aircraft that we have ever seen before.  The object had no propeller, no wings, made no noise, and had a square shape to it.  I have a video on my phone of this object. It's not the clearest video but you can see the square shape and the lights.  I have four witnesses that seen it.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
3 redish lights over saint louis, triangle shape;2010-10-06 22:30:00;unknown;3 redish lights over saint louis, triangle shape Looking out to the east, I saw 3 redish lights right above the horzion. there where in a triangle shape. They seem to be slowly moving together, keeping there shape. I have lived in saint louis my whole life and I have seen this before, I have seen it about 3 times this year alone. All 3 times this year and a the other times threw out my life, they have always been in the same spot in the sky, it is always 3 redish lights making a triangle shape in the sky(I can't tell if its one big object our 3 small ones), and its always the same size, it almost seems like its floating there, I have sat out one night just to wach to see how long it stays there, I sat there for about 2 hours before going to bed due to boredom. The lights did not move. I have seen the object move a little bit before, when it dose move it always keeps the same shape size and speed wich makes me think it is one HUGE object in the sky with 3 lights on its coners. But yeah, oi have seen this th! ing for years and I will keep seeing it for years to come, its almost come part of nomal life for me to see this object a few times a year( its always a few moths apart) the next time it shows up ill take pics and videos of it.

6 lights spanning across the street , a triangle shaped object hovering and spinning, silent;2011-12-24 19:50:00;approx 90 seconds;6 lights spanning across the street , a triangle shaped object hovering and spinning, silent I was coming home from spending Christmas eve with family.  As I was driving down my street to my house, I saw 6 orange lights in the sky.  I was thinking at first they were Christmas lights someone had figured out how string high up in the sky across the street, but realized they were too high to be hung using the telephone poles.  My next thought was that they were strung somehow using the church steeple on one side but couldn't figure out what was holding them up on the other side of the street.  I parked my truck, walked to the top of the driveway. I was planning on walking down to the church (1 block down) to see how they had strung the light across the street.  When I got to the top of my driveway, only 3 lights were left in the sky.  Not only that, but they were no longer crossing the street, they were now hovering over the homes one block up to the left.  I walked a couple houses up to get a better look. I realized the lights were forming a triangle! shaped object.  Then I realized I could acutally see the object against the dark sky.  It was a long, thin triangle about the size of the block it was hovering over.  It was also completley silent.  It was hovering and then began a lazy spin.  The tip of the triangle was spinning away from me.  I saw the two base corner lights.  The right base light faded, then the left base light.  It seemed to take a long time for the left base light to fade out.  When I realized there was an actual triangle shaped object hovering over the block of homes, I also realized that I must have first seen two triangle objects over the street.  I also realized that this meant the tips of the triangles were in the middle of the street, the bases on either side.  That is the only way to describe the lights I saw across the street.  Two vertical from each other on either side and two in the middle of the street.  I looked around to see if there was anyone else in the street who might have seen this! as well, and of course, there wasn't.  Neither did a car pass! by duri ng this time.  The area where I saw the triangle hovering is a quiet block of homes, however, the street they face is a pretty busy local street.  I would be surprised if I was the only one who saw this.  I'm going to listen to the 10:00 news to see if anyone else reported this, but that's probably futile.  I also know there are two airfields in the immediate area. One is Lambert Airfield, the other is Scott AirForce base.  I do remember a few years ago (8 or so maybe?) there was a report of a UFO that made the news on the Illinois side of the river.  I cannot identify what I saw, but I know I saw something I've never seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Noticed an orange light against the night sky outside a window.  When we went outside there were three orange lights I would describe as floating across the sky from the west to the east.  There was no sound.   My husband said he saw each was a triangular shape with a light at each point.   In the distance the line up in a straight line for a minute and then separated again.  As we lost sight of them I went to the front yard to see if the were still visible.   A neighbor was walking his dogs when I saw two more come over the rooftops.  I yelled to my husband who came out as I pointed to them.   There were three lights again.   The neighbor said he came out when he saw the lights also.  He asked the same question we had, What the hell are those?;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Very high space craft moving extremely fast and jogging across sky, horizon to horizon in a less than a minute.;2012-02-25 19:00:00;1 Minute maybe;Very high space craft moving extremely fast and jogging across sky, horizon to horizon in a less than a minute. We were  going to look at the moon and two planets, jupiter and venus-i think, in the western sky and look for the northern lights.  The local news NBC 5 St. Louis said they would all be out tonight and the sky would be very beautiful.  As we walked out the door and looked up we saw an odd airplane way up in the sky and thought look at how fast they are going.  It was moving from the southeast to the north west. (our front door faces south)  This was way up in the sky headed toward the big dipper. It was moving very fast, and was way, way up in the sky. We thought it might be the russian kosmos satellite, because kosmos was suppose to be out tonight also, so we looked at the thing on our i phone and it was not available or identifiable and it was not a satellite. This thing was triangle in shape with a thin line around the triangle and also had white and red lights flashing on it. Man it was moving super fast from s.e. to n.w then it looked like it shifted or b! lurred and it took a direct norht path. then another immediate jog to the due north. then it shifted back to the left or the west and right back to the north and then back to the northwest again. we watched it dissapear into the northern sky. we could see it until it went behind the horizon.  This was big, fast and way up there.  Moved much faster than the space station when it comes over. We have never reported a ufo we look at the sky often on with our i phone apps because we know what we are looking at now, most of the time.  This thing was big, fast and simply fantastic.  I think it was very special. I kept saying to my friend, this is something very special until it disappeared.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

triangle lights moving in a counter clockwise motion a yellow/orange color.;2013-02-23 19:45:00;1-2 minutes;triangle lights moving in a counter clockwise motion a yellow/orange color At 17:45 in St. Louis, MO, I witnessed a unidentified flying object.  My location was Hampton ave and Eichleberger.   I noticed the car passenger next to me driving off pointing up, I looked up and pulled my vehicle over.  I was looking west, it was three bright yellow/orange lights rotating counter clockwise and shifted 90° and now looked like it was rotating vertical.   Then it seemed to fade away gradually.   I tried to record it, my phone only has an eight mega-pixel camera.  It didn't come out well, but if you look at it you could see some lights. I'm a veteran of the USAF and a mechanic now.  I've never seen anything move like this what so ever.  I know mechanics well this was something very different.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

The object usually appears to the south and west of St. Louis.  Driving down I-170 at the connection of I-64 I noticed the same object but this time it was west of Clayton and near I-64.  It seemed like a very slow moving or hovering bright light.  But this time it was close to the highway.    The full moon was up it was 9:30 p.m. and I had my moon roof open on my car.  I actually drove under the object west of McKnight road and east of Clayton road exit.  It turned out to be a triangle shaped object like a flying wing hovering about 300-500 feet above the trees.  It made no sound.  It actually had 3 bright lights and one green light.  It looked a little like one of the military type of flying wings except it wasn't flying and this thing was very low and about the size of a small aircraft almost like the size of drone craft.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Going to cross train tracks.  An eighteen wheeler flat bed with supplies was located on a road that paralleled the train tracks.  The craft was located over the flat bed and hovered by it.  It looked black and was light up only by three white lights on the corners.  One was located in the center.  It turned from Southwest to Westward direction.  Kept going didn't want to stop my friend from driving.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Triangular craft with solid red, blue and green lights at the corners and a bright white light in the middle over hwy 40 and 170;2013-12-25 05:00:00;~5 minutes;Triangular craft with solid red, blue and green lights at the corners and a bright white light in the middle over hwy 40 and 170 Heading south on 170 from Page at about 5 am, still middle of the night dark with a clear sky, noticed a very bright light ahead.  It first appeared to be a very bright star, like a planet, flickering and low towards the horizon.  Looking ahead it was a immediate eye catch. About a minute later I could tell it was local and moving, we were heading towards each other.  The light then in my mind resembled a landing gear light on a plane.  I could tell it was flying very low.  There is a airport in it's direction about 7 miles away, way too low for that distance, about 500-700 ft. I reached Hwy 40 and when I was close to the interchange to go west it was just reaching hwy 40 from the south side, on a path heading north still just west of the interchange.  I then noticed three additional lights, red, green and blue in a triangle pattern, red leading.  The moment I realized this object was unusual was when I realized the marker lights were not blinking, no tail light, the bright white light was in the middle of the craft, not shining in just the forward direction but in every direction. By this time I was on the ramp for 40 west.  The craft just crossed hwy 40. With the height seeming to be 500-700 ft or about a little higher than a cell tower, I could not make a outline of the craft.  Just the four lights.  Heading towards the side of it getting on 40 it seemed to be moving very slowly at this point and by time I was passing it's path behind it it seemed to have rapidly picked up speed and changed direction to northwest. Now when telling the very same people I talk to everyday, including my wife, immediately there's a look like uh huh yeah right.  So with that in mind... when I was on the on ramp for hwy 40 and I was heading towards the side of the craft, I saw what appeared to be a small rectangular door opening.  It was behind the middle white light and off centered.  I took it as a door because the dim glow grew as such from a door opening.  I could not make any details out from what was inside just that the dim glow was indirect.  I don't tell anyone anymore but figured I should atleast report it. I was captivated at first as much as anyone is by a low flying plane but when realizing something is different about what I was seeing, I didn't want to pull over, fumble with my phone for a pic... all I wanted to do was observe and figure it out.

Equilateral triangle of stars, simultaneously disappear on 6/14/2014 over St. Louis Missouri.;2014-06-14 19:00:00;4 minutes;Equalateral Triangle of stars, simultaneously disappear on 6/14/2014 over St. Louis, Missouri. While watching a Shakespeare Play at Forest Park, I noticed in the night sky some stars.  It was a pretty clear night and very windy.  I took special notice of three stars that were equilaterally aligned and formed a perfect triangle.   I watched them for about four minutes thinking how crazy it was that they were so evenly distanced apart.  Then simultaneously they all went out.   I thought wow that’s really weird so I’ll just wait to see if they reappear, maybe clouds went over.  But they did not reappear and this was about 9:45 pm.  And the other stars that were in the sky did not go out. I whispered to my husband that I thought I saw a UFO and he said maybe it was a summer Triangle.  Why did they all go out at once?   I was curious if anyone else reported this sighting.   I did not notice any other colored lights.  I simply thought that these were stars, until they all went out.

Stars that formed an equilateral triangle that disappeared simultaneously.;2014-06-14 21:00:00;4 minutes;Stars that formed an equilateral triangle that disappeared simultaneously. While watching an outside Shakespeare play in St. Louis, Missouri, my attention was mostly on the play until I glanced up and took notice of the equilateral triangle of stars.  I saw three stars geometrically in line they formed an equilateral triangle.   At first, I thought that they were just stars, but then I noticed how equal the lines were.   So I started watching them instead of the play, just for a about 4 minutes.  Then they all disappeared right before my eyes, simultaneous all at the same time.   I thought that maybe there was a cloud.  So I waited to see if they would reappear, they did not.   And the sky was pretty clear, with some wind and a few clouds. I know that in the constellations there are Summer and Winter star triangles.  I told my husband and he said that it was the Summer Triangle.  Why would they all disappear at the same time and not return.  I looked for them later and did not see them again.

I had looked up and noticed a craft with a red, and green lights in the sky.  Don't know of any aircraft that has green and red lights.  The red light was as red as a stoplight, and the green light was as green as a green light at a traffic stop.  It look like the front of the craft have the green light on it.  As I went further south I was watching the craft move about in the ssky.  It moved tightly.  I believe its all me, or notice that I seen it.  It had seemed to follow me for a while then turned away.I had flashed my lights from the vehicle to see if it would follow it had caught up to me quite quickly.   I am not sure on what I scene.

Triangular object with white and red lights flying low, very quiet.;2016-09-04 21:30:00;brief;Triangular object with white and red lights flying low, very quiet. Traveling along Interstate 270 I saw a low flying triangular aircraft.  It had a strange pattern of lights with large white circles and red flashing lights. It could have been a plane landing but I don't think I was near Boeing or the Airport. Just seemed strange and quiet.
