slow moving object changed colors from violet to white to transparent except for a spot in the center that was constant;2008-10-09 17:00:00;30-45seconds;slow moving object changed colors from violet to white to transparent except for a spot in the center that was constant I am a 32 yr old male in good health with good eyesight. I was working on a house in green park, MO. near south county on 10-9-2008 around 5pm I looked up and saw what appeared to be a semi-clear spherical object moving/falling in the northeastern part of the sky. It had a oblong dot in the center and what looked like wavy lines changing shapes inside, the lines looked like electricity they changed color from violet to white and then dissapeared. The spot in the center was the only constant. I am not sure the object was spherical as it seemed to change shape, the lines were the only thing I could see making a shape. I could see no outside edges. The object moved slowly as if drifting.I lost sight of the object when it passed the horizon of the roof of the house. I ran to the other side of the house but could no longer see the object.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
20-30 glowing orange orbs travelled slowly across I-55 near the Meremec River.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from STL policeman.  PD));2012-06-01 21:00:00;10 minutes;20-30 glowing orange orbs travelled slowly across I-55 near the Meremec River While driving home, I and my family observed 20-30 orange glowing balls travel slowly through the sky across I-55 and the Meremac River from SW to NE.   The altitude is not known, but the event lasted some 10 minutes.  My wife was able to video record most of the incident.   Others stopped to view the happening, which actually led to a multiple vehicle accident.  The objects where absolutely silent and sequentially disappeared at a certain point in the sky when they finally reached it.   Was NOT and airplane or helicopter!  Seemed to be far to high to be chinese lanterns. ((NUFORC Note:  Report from STL policeman.  PD));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Spheroid obj executes vert. climb to 25,000 ft. in less than 3 mins.  ((NUFORC Note:  Exceptionally reliable and capable witness.  PD));2013-06-04 13:30:00;5-6 minutes;St. Louis, Missouri - June 4, 2013: Spheroid object executes vertical climb to 25,000 ft. in less than 3 minutes On Tuesday, June 4, 2013, at approximately 1:30pm, I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of  a St. Louis fast food restaurant for lunch located on Oakland Blvd. just east of Hampton Ave. and south of Interstate 64 and something to the northwest of me caught my eye. Looking through the windshield, I saw something move rapidly in a circular motion and it vanished quickly.  As a result, I thought I was looking at a remote control model airplane or a bird.  The object was very dark against a fairly bright sky, below a scattered overcast. The object appeared to be very low over the distance treetops when in view, but momentarily vanished and I thought it went down below the tree line or the horizon.  I could not determine how far the object was laterally, from my position.  There was nothing behind it that it crossed to get a distance estimate. I looked down to my sandwich and when I looked back up to the same location, (which was to my northwest), I saw an object, roughly spherical in shape, very dark, which began an immediate vertical ascent. What put me into a sudden What the hell moment was that the object was moving straight up and pretty fast.  I leaned down toward the dash and crooked my neck to watch the sphere continue its vertical ascent as it kept going until it reached what appeared to be the cloud base (the cloud ceiling). At that moment, the object then stopped moving and held stationary at the cloud base.  It remained stationary for approximately 2 minutes.  It could have been moving slowly to the right, or perhaps the clouds were moving slowly to the left, but after about two minutes, the object merged into the cloud above it and became obscured. At its highest observed altitude (as it moved into the cloud), the object could be distinguished as a spherical shape, a black dot at this point. As I observed the object , I was so captivated by what I was seeing that I failed to do a simple time count as it ascended but the total time from near ground level to the cloud base at 25,000 ft. was not more than 3 minutes maximum, but could have been as little as 30 seconds. Following the event, I placed phone calls to the nearby Forest Park administrative office as well as a local university's science departments and inquired if any kind of balloon had been launched. All inquiries came of negative. I inquired into how to find the accurate cloud ceiling for the date and time of the sighting and was referred to the National Weather Service where I found the Three Day Weather records and June 4, 2013, data established the cloud ceiling at OVC250, which means overcast at 25,000 Feet, and that matched what I observed. Using a speed and time calculator, I found the following possible indicated speeds of the object.  The following speeds are based on three estimated times for the object to travel from near ground level to 25,000 feet. 30 seconds, 1, 2, and 3 minutes. 3 Minutes: 94.69 MPH  2 Minutes: 142.04 MPH  1 Minute: 284.09 MPH 30 Seconds: 568.18 MPH   Having seen a variety of balloons in the air, I’ve never seen a balloon ascend at these rates of speed, and although I cannot state exactly “what” this object was, it must have possessed considerable size because I was able to observe the object at the cloud ceiling, or 25,000 feet. If anyone else in the St. Louis area observed this object on June 4, 2013, I would very much like to see additional details.

We would welcome other reports from anyone who may have been witness to the event.  PD));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
3 glowing orange spheres travel slowly and silently before extinguishing.;2014-05-09 20:45:00;10 minutes;3 glowing orange spheres travel slowly and silently before extinguishing. We saw 3 spheres of orange light floating slowly, and silently across the night sky.  One was following the other, heading east and the third one was further away and heading north.  The one traveling north sped up, and then extinguished.  The two heading east traveled silently for a while then the one in the lead extinguished.  The last one continued on for just a few more minutes before it too went out.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Eight orange spheres over St. Louis.;2015-08-20 21:15:00;20 minutes;Eight orange spheres over St. Louis My son and I along with a neighbor witnessed eight orange spheres traveling SW to NE.   The first three that we saw traveled separately, but along the same path, approximately 2 minutes apart.   The fourth one that we saw stopped and remained stationary for roughly one minute, before ascending straight up until it disappeared.   The fifth light that we saw followed the same path as the first three but seemed to travel faster and was much brighter.   The last three traveled one right after the other and formed a triangle, then separated as they traveled out of view.  The elevation was that of the helicopter traffic that we see, but the speed was much faster. While we watched the fourth sphere hover we heard and saw a military jet.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Odd light seen over St. Louis.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-15 21:10:00;10 minutes;Odd light seen over St. Louis. UFO Report filed 06/16/17:    On 06/15/17, at 9:05 pm, standing on our deck preparing to barbeque, I saw a light in southeastern sky that was moving toward my position gradually.  I noticed that it looked different from an aircraft (we live south of St. Louis airport so airplanes are common and frequent) and had an orange/red glow much like a flame so my first guess was that it could be a hot air balloon.   As it got closer, I tried to listen for the familiar sound of gas burners but was surprised at its total silence.  It soon lost the light and moved to more of a north course as a very dim sphere.  It seemed to speed up and soon was beyond the trees on our horizon to the north.   The entire siting lasted approximately 10 minutes.   Upon reflection, I don’t recall ever seeing a hot air balloon past sunset and never saw one move so fast.   Also, I could not discern a fast wind to propel a balloon.

It;2019-04-01 19:17:00;<4 seconds;Facing south east on Telegraph Road, I was walking and as I left a QT gas station, I looked up and saw a glowing sphere shaped object.  It was shing bright blue with a white glow to the back, almost like a propellant or exhaust.  The object was in my view only for a few seconds before it flew off at alarming speeds.  The fastest thing I have ever seen in my lifetime.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
