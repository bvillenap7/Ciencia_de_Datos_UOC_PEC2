chased by 3 foot silver cylinder in sky.;1976-07-15 13:00:00;1 minute;chased by 3 foot silver cylinder in sky. I went down to my dad's garden on a very bright day which is about 200 feet from his house.  I looked up in the sky and probably about 300 feet in the air I saw a silver cylinder shape that looked about the size of a baton falling in my direction.   As fast as I could I headed to the house thinking this might have fallen out of a plane.  It started overtaking me as I started zig zagging.   Right before I reached the porch it overtook me and was maybe 15 feet above me and then just disappeared.  It was silver and made no noise. 35 years later and this still bothers me.  Thought you might have some ideas. Thank you, ((personal information deleted)) after 1 p.m. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, who corrected the date to July 1976.  Date is approximate.

A long, finger-shaped, metal object hovered over the creek behind my house for several minutes.;1997-06-07 22:30:00;about 3 minutes;Summary : A long, finger-shaped, metal object hovered over the creek behind my house for several minutes. After my friend ((Name deleted)) and I finished watching a rerun of Seinfeld, we went outside for a smoke.  When we got outside, Gene pointed to a large object in the sky which hovered several yards above the trees in the creek behind my house.  It was about 300 feet long and was rounded at each end, sort of like a cigar or finger.  We just watched it for 2 or three minutes, and then it rose silently up a few feet and flew away almost instantaneously.  I have a bachelor's degree in teaching, specializing in modern American History.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Object was dark colored, no lights, with perpendicular ridges.  It was small, no more than 7 feet tall, looking almost like a probe of some type. I noticed other passengers looking at the object from their cars and slowed down as I was.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

shinny, cylindrical object seen above St Louis, Missouri;2004-05-09 13:30:00;15 minutes;shinny, cylindrical object seen above St Louis, Missouri A very shinny, cylindrical object was seen above St Louis. It was not directly above but in a north-eastern part of the sky and seem to be floating. It was moving very slowly, too slow to be a jet or airplane and the direction was in a south-western direction or toward the sky directly above St Louis. It could not be viewed anylonger after about 15 minutes as it was above the clouds and became blocked by clouds. Does anyone know what it was or where it went? date object was seen is 05-09-04 at 1:30 in afternoon.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Black cylinder flying at altitude of airline within reaching distance.;2004-08-15 14:00:00;1 minute;Black cylinder flying at altitude of airline within reaching distance. Black cylinder in bright daylight  I was traveling back to Kansas City on a Southwest flight during the middle of the day.  The sun was at full shine with no cloud coverage at top average airline altitude.  I looked out the window as I often do on flights and saw this black cylinder shaped object flying within reaching distance to the airline window.  This black cylinder had a semi-sphere head that resembled a basic security camera gloss, possibly made out of glass.  This object was no bigger than half the size of my forearm in both length and width.  As I was watching it fly just a bit faster than average airline speed covering an extra foot every 2 seconds, I had no quick access to a camera or possibly alerting another individual fast enough before it was gone. I have no evidence of this event as far as other witnesses or footage.  This object was seen years ago and I only have my word to back this claim.  I will say knowing I was lacking witnesses and camera footage, I kept telling myself to fully memorize the moment.  I didn’t take my eye off of it for a second and studied every visible thing I could.  This object was also in no way attached to the airline, but clearly had the confidence of flying so close on the brightest of days.   I fully believe what I saw was far more advanced as far as flight technology than anything I have ever seen, even as basic as it looked.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Bizarre, shiny, cylindrical object that moved intelligently for 15 minutes in broad daylight (St. Louis).;2005-06-02 18:00:00;15 minutes;Bizarre, shiny, cylindrical object that moved intelligently for 15 minutes in broad daylight (St. Louis). While driving with my wife to the store she noticed something in the sky and realized it was oddly shaped (cylindrical) and moving in an intelligent manner. She told me that I should pull over to look at it because she was convinced it was not an ordinary aircraft (no wings, no tail stabilizer, and no navigational lights).  We immediately pulled into a nearby parking lot and got out of the car within a minute of her sighting. We stood by the car and I put my sunglasses on to block out the sun which was near the object and making it hard for me to make out.  After doing so I realized everything my wife said was an understatement.   I had never seen a craft move so oddly (against the wind, stopping, moving again and then finally moving up through the upper clouds and disappearing completely.  I stared at this vehicle which to me looked like a metallic object but somewhat shaded due to the Sun. There was absolutely nothing sticking out of this object which made it appear eerily saucer-like and the way it moved made it very convincing.  Also the object made no sound.  Personally I am convinced that this U.F.O. was either a classified military vehicle or of unknown origin. Please take note of the sketches I made that same day when I returned home while the observation was fresh in my mind. ((NUFORC Note:  High-quality graphic of the object, and how it moved, is provided by the witness.  PD));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
A cluster of 10-12 metal orb-like objects hovering above the street.;2012-10-15 18:20:00;1 minute;A cluster of 10-12 metal orb-like objects hovering above the street. Sighting happened October 15, 2012: About 6:20 pm, I was on a street in the middle of South St. Louis City. I saw about 10-12 brushed nickel colored metal orbs, with red lights on the front-reminded me of a red flood lamp, only thicker in the back-hovering in a cluster about 30-40 ft above the street (maybe 5-7 ft above the stoplight). I have never seen anything like it.  I am still stunned. I called a few of the businesses located at this intersection and asked if maybe they had some sort of floating lights/ lanterns as a promotion (I was thinking red for the Cardinals), but none of the people at these locations said they had lights like this and they hadn’t seen anything.  I know I sounded completely crazy calling them, but I am very intrigued by what I saw!   I consider myself a professional person. I have a college education. I am a skeptic, but this has made me incredibly curious.  It may have been a government/ military thing, or perhaps some really talented person(s) built these remote controlled objects.  However, I have no idea and I would love to get an answer.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
