Saw what appeared to be a commercial jet headed for airport but no lights or sound;2010-10-02 22:00:00;15 seconds;Saw what appeared to be a commercial jet headed for airport but no lights or sound I was out running at the Clayton High School track/football field around 10:00 p.m. and saw what looked like a commercial airliner on a flight path towards Lambert Airport but it had absolutely no lights and it made no sound whatsoever.  I often run at night on this track and almost always see aircraft heading toward the airport during my run.  I am familiar with the typical flight path of planes on their way to Lambert.  What I saw tonight was a clear outline/silhouette of the wings of what looked like a typical jet headed for landing but it was lower (in altitude) and was traveling a little faster than the planes I usually see when running at this track.  I could make out the wings quite clearly but the tail and nose (assuming they were there) of the craft were less clear.  There were absolutely NO lights whatsoever - just a silhouette against the dark sky.  It moved just like a regular jet but there was absolutely no sound.  I had just seen a jet go by on! the same path about 5 minutes or so prior to this sighting.  After reporting by phone to NUFORC, I called Lambert Airport police/security and they transferred me to someone named John in Ops (couldn't clearly hear what John said when he answered). I told John what I had seen (jet with no lights/no sound headed toward Lambert) and he said they'd had no reports of anything unusual tonight.  I will also mention that Boeing has a large facility right next to Lambert Airport - perhaps some kind of test plane?;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
V-shaped perfect formation of lights traveling over St Louis, heading eastward, soundlessly.;2010-10-26 21:00:00;15 seconds;V-shaped perfect formation of lights traveling over St Louis, heading eastward, soundlessly. Was outside at 9:00 pm on 10/26/10, with my 20 year old son.  We were setting up a 12 Dobsonian telescope to view Jupiter, when we noticed a V-shaped formation with numerous lights on each side.  Not aircraft running light, more like luminous spots.   The lights stayed in perfect formation, and moved very rapidly eastward, toward Scott AFB.  Absolutely no sound whatsoever.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

They were picking me up to head to the bar.  They were heading east on Olive blvd. at the intersection of Appalachian Trail Dr.   2 extremely bright lights were observed in the sky to the NE of their position.  It took them a 2 mins of studying them hovering high in the atmosphere flickering, rapidly changing direction and altitude, and trading places in the sky for roughly 5 mins.  Both witnesses took mulitple photographs of the two lights.  It wasn't until they showed me the pictures of the 2 lights i immediately said theres 5 in the the last couple pictures.  They were taken just a couple mins after spotting them still heading east on Olive blvd.  Now at the intersection of Woodsmill Rd. looking east over the 7-11.  The last photo was taken on olive just before highway 141.   Both witnesses have said they are reporting this incident with the full story soon.  These pictures are from the driver of the vehicle iphone.   The passenger has more photos he will include in his report.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
