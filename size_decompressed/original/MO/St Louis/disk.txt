The saucer was sighted south from St. Louis as I was moving toward  Dallas Texas( highway 40 something?).I was driving with my glasses on the dash as I spotted what I thought was an airplane in the upper right hand corner of the window. I looked away thinking it was nothing. Something strange about the object must have registered in my head because I did a double-take to reinvestigate. The object descended until it was no higher than the telephone poles lining the highway and was in plain view from my passenger window and no more than 100 feet away.I stopped the car and rolled down my window to insure there would be no reflections in the glass to impede an objective assesment of what I was seeing. I also slipped on my glasses for a clearer view. The object made no sound whatsoever which was particularly note-worthy as the craft was clearly metallic and what appeared to be quite substantial in weight. This was no ball! oon. The craft moved north while following a perfectly parallel synchronicity with the telephone poles and the ground.It was moving no faster than 15-20 miles per hour so I had a perfectly clear view. Its lack of sound and perfect smoothness and machine-like precision were quite remarkable. I knew, even as I was seeing it, that this was something never seen on the 6 o'clock news. As it kept moving north and became more distant, my memory is unclear as to how it left the scene.It was a good quarter of a mile away when it seemed to just disappear. I have a vague recollection of it ascending in the same fashion as it descended,but that may be only my mind filling in the memory gaps.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

A saucer that glowed like the moon and was the size of the moon cruised over town at about 25 miles per hour from East to West.;2002-05-06 15:50:00;2 or 3 minutes;A saucer that glowed like the moon and was the size of the moon cruised over town at about 25 miles per hour from East to West. I was driving North on Kirkwood Road.  There was chaos on the road.  Two cars were pulled over by the police with flashing lights, could be an accident.  Also, there was an ambulance and Fire Truck going to another scene around the same time. As I was driving, instead of looking at the chaos, I looked up into the sky and saw a saucer the color of the moon.  It was about the size of the moon, however, it was moving and I was sitting still.  It was cruising from East to West...maybe 25 miles per hour from where I saw it.  It went behind a building and I was not able to follow it.  An airplane flew by in a NW direction and the sun shone on it and there was a silvery reflection.  But this saucer had no silvery reflection, it was glowing like the moon would glow.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Saw a strange hovering object move across road.;2005-08-31 23:30:00;20-30 seconds;Saw a strange hovering object move across road. I was traveling west on Forder Rd. in St.louis, Mo on August 31st, 2005 at approximately 11:35. As i was driving, I noticed an object traveling across the road at a very low and smooth pace.  My first thought was that it was a helicopter, but as i approached the object, it became very clear to me that it was not.  With the object not more than 200ft from me and my windows down, you would think, had it been a helicopter, the sound of rotating blades would be more than enough to assure me it was in fact a helicopter.  The bright object which consisted of very familiar colors (red, green, and white) where blinking in a consecutive pattern which in someways was reasurring me it must be something of human construction. But as the object continued to move and i traveled closer, the shape appeared to be disc-like. I know this sounds very typical and familiar, but this is what i saw. The object continued to move in a northeast direction and as it slowly disappeared over the tree line, i made a quick right turn onto Lemay Ferry Rd. which put me in the perfect line of sight to see an object that had just flew over the tree line and all i saw was an empty sky. I now sit and type this report as i was instructed by some person on the other end of the phone from which i called the number for reporting UFO sightings, with tears running from my eyes, chills all over my body, my heart is pounding so hard i can hear it throughout my entire body, sick to my stomach, and a set of shaky hands that are barely allowing my to type.  Now, i am a person of somewhat respectable integrity. I hold a very good job at a very reputable company. I am not one of fairy tales and fictitious stories, but what i saw tonight will remain in my mind for the rest of my life. From what i know of modern aviation and man-made flying capabilities, what i saw was not of this planet. Im an advocate of discovering life beyond ours and look forward to the day that all of the world sits in aw of another intelligent being not of this planet, but after my experience on this evening, im not sure im ready, more less the rest of the world.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

It emitted no distinguishable noise over the car's engine or through the car's glass windows. The object was also huge, probably the size of at least 2 3 story duplexes. I read other reports of similar description around the St. Louis region, so I thought it would be dutiful for me to post this. Hopefully helping us make sense of this strange yet fascinating phenomenon. In Pennsylvania, I've never seen a flying saucer up this detailed and close. The most striking thing to me about what I saw was the metallic like texture. I am still in awe - but I don't feel like I can question what I saw. I am 22 years old. I know I'm not the oldest, but I'm not stupid. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

I knew it couldn't be an earth aircraft due to blinking lights moving in a circular fashion. I didn't hear anything but the music that my neighbors had left playing in their garage, but I estimate that it was about 1200 feet above ground, and about 30 meters in diameter. Note that this is just an estimate. I knew it couldn't be an earth aircraft once I started focusing on it. I just couldn't believe my eyes. My dad and brother seem to think I'm lying, but I know there is life outside earth, life forms smarter than us. And that was their craft.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Two black circular objects flying through storm clouds in rotating flight pattern.;2012-10-25 16:30:00;30-60 seconds;Two black circular objects flying through storm clouds in rotating flight pattern. The sighting occurred within the hour. It was just before a rain storm. I was standing at the top of my street since it has a pretty good view over Manchester Road and out West towards Weidman and Mason Road. Black clouds were gathering and so I was watching. Something caught my eye to the right and I focused on what it was. It appeared to be two black objects flying in a circular pattern, almost parallel to each other. It wasn’t birds, it wasn’t clouds and it wasn’t just something caught in the wind. At least one of them I could tell had a definitive disk shape. It was hard to keep a steady view of the objects because they were flying through the low lying storm clouds. Just before they disappeared completely from view, one of them peaked directly through the clouds and it was then I could see the disc shape. I did not notice any lights, I did not notice any type of rotation of the objects, only that they were flying in a circular pattern. Their movement wa! s fast, about the speed of a helicopter circling an area. It definitely was not something natural. Right after they disappeared from view the wind picked up and the rain started to fall. I tried to look further, but could not see anything any more. It was a very shocking experience. It only lasted 30 seconds to 1 minute.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Maybe there is an explan;2013-09-14 22:00:00;10 minutes;I sent a similar e-mail to Debbie Ziegelmeyer and Margie Kay (MUFON) but thought I should post it here as well.  Maybe there is an explanation for this event?????  I stepped out onto my back deck, (evening of Saturday, September 14th) started to sit down on a chair but looked up before doing so.  Coming from the direction of the southeast there is a bright orange round object moving over my house. Higher then a helicopter but much closer then an airplane.  It is bright orange on the outside/underside but a deeper orange in the center.  The color in the center seemed to be moving but that might have something to do with the atmosphere.   I stepped into the house and the clock reads 9:40 pm.  About 30 seconds later a second one appears coming from the same direction, displaying the same thing as the first.  About 30 seconds after that another orange one goes over my house but still at a level that I could see the darker orange moving around inside the center.  All three objects move out of sight into the northwest sky.  I went back outside and have been watching but I do not think any more will come tonight. I am not very good at trying to judge size and distance but they were close and big enough that I could see the variance of the orange colors inside the spheres/UNDERSIDE.  I believe if I would stretch out my arm, the objects would be about the size of the palm of my hand.  This is the first time I have seen anything like this.  I did have trouble sleeping I kept seeing images of them in my mind all night long.  All I can say is, it might be explained away but I can see the stars in the sky, so it is a clear night.  There are no other lights like an airplane would have and they were completely SILENT but moved at about the same speed as an airplane would travel.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Black circular object, no lights, traveling across sky slowly, unaffected by wind currents.;2014-06-09 19:30:00;10 minutes;Black circular object, no lights, traveling across sky slowly, unaffected by wind currents While swimming my friend and I noticed a circular-disk like object.  It was dark black and seemed unaffected by the wind.   As we watched it go by it stayed about the altitude and speed as far we could discern.   Several people were there on their respective boats and pointed it out in the sky.   Many were jokingly speculating a drone or UFO.  We are unsure which it is, and unable to find any information on the object.   Once it disappeared over the tree line, we didn't see it again.

Black discoid object flying from E to W, observed early afternoon from residential rooftop during clear sky over N side, St. Louis, Mo.;2015-06-09 13:00:00;10 seconds;Black discoid object flying from E to W, observed early afternoon from residential rooftop during clear sky over N side, St. Louis, Mo. Black discoid object flying from E to W, observed early afternoon from residential roof top during clear sky over north side St. Louis city, Mo.  No wings, no lights, just steady trajectory across sky until out of view over western horizon.  There were many local black birds in the windy sky directly over neighborhood, but none at ufo's altitude.   It wasn't moving at extreme speed, but should've at least been traveling a few hundred mph due to the lack of time it took to cross the entire visible sky over head.  It was gone in at least 10 seconds after gracefully soaring right across the open sky.   I thought it was a big black bird (or hawk possibly) sailing a high wind current at first, but as I watched without distraction it never exposed any wings or showed any obvious biological identifiers or movements.  From my visual perspective, the ufo flew in a straight line at a steady speed.  I was not a gigantic object, but couldn't have been any smaller than a car.  No identifying marking or designs, at least from my distance.   While watching I tapped on window to attract my nephew, but he had just left the house.  My wife came by, but didn't come on roof as she was preoccupied and I still wasn't sure what I was witnessing.   I reluctantly did not pull my cell phone out quick enough to access the camera once I realized i was witnessing an anomaly.  As soon as it disappeared over the western horizon, I went back inside + informed my wife why I had nocked on the window.   This is the 2nd sighting I have witness from my roof which technically is the 4th floor of our house + permits an awesome view over the surrounding neighborhoods and metro city downtown. *My 1st sighting from this location was at night, a glowing orb like ship appeared (ironically) over the western horizon from behind some clouds heading west and then redirected its corse into a sharp decent down to earth and out of view.  That account took place about 2 years ago, the same week my step son took pictures of an entire mass fleet of glowing orb like ufos moving out across the night sky from an unknown location he witnessed with many other residents at his fathers previous apt complex way out in O'fallon, Mo.  We still have the picture he took with his cellphone.  There were no other airplanes in sky, as usually there are as we are under the direct path all airplanes take to taxi Lambert Airport.  The ship also did not glow or perform any other apparent actions/activities. These accounts are  astonishing even if they are all just drones or black military vehicles.  They are apparently becoming more obvious publicly. I am an US military veteran.  As a child I studied all kinds of jets, vehicles + technologies into my adult life.  In the field of creative arts I have also studied much structure, anatomy and behaviors of many things.  I am extremely positive I have witnessed these specific anomalies + anticipate more disclosure +/or public observations.  Hopefully, I could not have been the only one who witnessed this last event.  You never see this stuff over the city, ever.  I've been waiting to see them for myself a long time, but am not convinced these are directly alien, even though I do not rule out the possibility due to all cultural histories.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
