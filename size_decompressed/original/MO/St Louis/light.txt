Confirmation of previous report in Nevada, Mo., 1976.  This really happened.;1976-07-15 00:00:00;1-2 seconds;Confirmation of previous report in Nevade, Mo., 1976.  This really happened I want to comment on a report that happened to a group of people in Nevada, Missouri. Nevada 	MO.  	Light	 30 minutes	   We were star gazing on a beautiful summer night at approximately midnight.  Many stars where visable and after perhaps an hour...probab  I also cannot confirm the date since it was so long ago, but I too remember waking up in the middle of the night and was looking out of the window up into the sky.  Very clear night.  Stars were everywhere.   Then suddenly in the span of 1 - 2 seconds, I saw a star fly into view, make an immediate 90 degree turn, fly a short distance, make another 90 degree turn and continued making 2 more 90 degree turns before flying out of view in the exact same way it flew in.  (Basically drew a big square in the sky and was gone in under 2 seconds.)  I say it was a star because it was the same light and intensity of the other easily seen stars.  No special shape, just a light. I'll always remember seeing that.  I feel blessed that I was able to witness it.  It enlightened me to believe that there maybe something out there.

Rapidly moving blue-green in sky over fireworks spectators;1997-07-04 21:15:00;1 second;Summary : Rapidly moving blue-green in sky over fireworks spectators On the evening in question, I was in the crowd near the Gateway Arch waiting for the fireworks display to begin at 2140.  At approximately 2115, I was looking up at helicoptors that were moving around the river and immediate airspace over the city near the Arch.  At about that time, I happened to notice an object, moving at an extremely rapid rate through the sky, almost directly overhead. The duration of the event was so short that I thought that it might have been some kind of meteorite or something similar.  The object was bluish-green in color, like a streaking fireball in shape, and moving east to west at a speed much faster than any aircraft, flare, fireworks, or shooting star/meteorite I have ever seen before.  The light gave off no observable sound, nor was there some kind of sonic boom or anything of the sort. I commented on it to my friend who missed it and wasn't interested in my observation.  I overheard others in the crowd in my immediate area comment on the light, so I'm pretty sure that there are others who can comment on seeing the light.  I am writing this, only because I happened to see a report in the news today about a similar series of observations across the river in Illinois.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Then it glowed a soft orange around the outer sphere and shot through a cloud bank, I could still see the bright glow through the hazieness of the cloud . faster than I could react, or say anything to anyone it was gone , just like that, no big production just flat gone! When I turned to my son who was standing next to me, he was already looking up at me. He asked me what the light was and I knew then that I was not seeing any sort of firework or pyrotechnics. It was flying at around the same altituide a commercial airliner would, but I've never seen anything move so quick. And there was NO sound as it shot across the sky .;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Object appeared below the moon. Travelled from Southeast to Northwest. Changed color and direction erratically.;1998-08-01 20:45:00;less than 2 minutes;Object appeared below the moon. Travelled from Southeast to Northwest. Changed color and direction erratically. My son-in-law and I were on the balcony of his apartment. He noticed an odd light below the moon and called my attention to it. The object appeared to be a light. Without a reliable frame of reference, it appeared to be approximately one-half the size of a pencil eraser viewed from the bottom. The object travelled at a good rate of speed from Southeast to Northwest. I estimate it covered approximately 120 degrees of arc in something under two minutes. There were two aspects of this light that were odd. It was constantly illuminated, but appeared to flicker rapidly, changing colors as it did so from red to blue. The flicker rate was very rapid, changing at least 30-40 times per second. The object's direction of travel was not in a straight line. It jumped from side to side and occasionally jumped backward, appearing to make 90 degree and even 180 degree course changes instantaneously. I am 56 years old, a self-employed management consultant with a masters degree in public administration. My son-in-law is an elementary school teacher. The sky was clear and the weather was very pleasant.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

At about 6:15 pm i went to pick up my fiance at his office where he worked.  I went out of my car to knock on the door and waited while he came to open the door.  After a while looked up into the sky.  I was a beautiful night.  As I looked I noticed an object in the sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane but it was flying too close and too fast.  In comparison to an airplane i would say to probably flow 10 times as fast.  I've watched airplanes fly across the sky before but no normal airplane goes that fast.  It also eluminated a bright green light, which was constant.  My Fiance came out and was also stunned.  It flow as if to go right over the horizon.  i also noticed alot of air traffic.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
UFO's over  Saint Louis and Metro East Counties.;2004-01-15 04:05:00;30 minutes;UFO's over  Saint Louis and Metro East Counties. It was about 4 AM on the night of January 15th 2004, When my friend and I were driving home from another friends house in Belleville IL. Between Belleville and Centerville IL, there is about a 5-8 mile strrtch of wood encompassed Highway, and thats when we saw and experienced the following events: About a mile or so past Fairview Hieghts, I inexplicablly had the sensation to look over my shoulder and to the left of me. At that moment I noticed something very out of the ordinary. Shining down on the surface of the adjacent, Westbound side of Interstate 64/40 were three blue circles of light. Even stranger, was that these concentric circles were pacing our car...in the same direction we were traveling, on the opposing westbound highway. Then what seemed to begin happening is that a state of...Oh well,What can I do...feeling came over me, not fear or panic, just....Oh well. My friend looked over after I said to look, she looked back at me, we looked at the clock on her car radio and it read 4:05 AM. We looked back at the lights and then eachother, and the next thing I knew it was 4:30 or so by the radio clock and we were entering the highway interchange near Centerville IL. about 6 or 7 miles from were we had just been! To this day me and my girl still talk about it. We also saw about a Year later, another strange object at her apartment complexs in Kirkwood Missouri. It was about noon, in the broad day light. I went out onto her back patio to smoke a cigarette, and as I was lighting it, I looked up to my left to see a jetliner cruise by and its contrail forming. Only, at the end of the contrail, and seemingly following the jetliner, was a bright green, glowing sphere of light. As soon as I noticed it though and called for my griend to qiickly grab her camera, it seemed to take notice in me. It bounced arounded and darted from point to point in the sky, almost as if it were putting on a show for me, just to make a point of saying Hi you can see me, I also see you. It kept this up until my friend returned with her camera, at which point this object shot right to my zenith. She quickly snapped a picture, and with that the object simply zipped off out of view. Although we knew whatever came out on that film would be low and questionable quality, nontheless we were still excited to see what we did have on it. When the film was developed though, oddly, every single print was blank.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Pulsating , odd performing aircraft(?);2007-08-08 22:00:00;@15 seconds;Pulsating , odd performing aircraft(?) I was sitting on the patio this evening enjoying a warm clear night. I'm an amateur astronomer/sky watcher and had a pair of 16X Nikons. I noticed a rather bright star moving from the NW to the SE. I watched it for @3 seconds and it disappeared. Then 3-4 seconds later it reappeared, still traveling in the same direction. I got the binoculars on it and it appeared simply as one of the brighter stars, in motion and with a constant glow. It repeated this twice, on the last illumination it came to a dead stop, increased in brightness @ 4X, remained at this maximum illumination for @ 2 seconds, and disappeared. That's it.  As I said, this object appeared as nothing more than a moving star, a rather common sighting of terrestrial origins. It was not moving exceptionally fast, it was the on/off of the light and it's finale that I found unusual. As for altitude I can't speculate beyond that, though not in what would be called space, it was MUCH higher than conventional civilian/commercial aircraft operate at. I've no idea what it was.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

I looked north, when I observed a brilliant pink light which was at the very top of my drivers side window.  I had to put my head up against the window which was appox. 4 inches down to observe this light.  The color of this pink light startled me.  With no reference point (it was dark) it was hard to estimate the size and the height of this light in the air.  I slowed my truck down from 35mph to about 5mph to stop and get out and take a closer look.  As I justed about stopped, the pink light emitted sparks then disappeared.  The pink circular light was moving east to west almost directly above me, no sound was emitted either.  This lasted 6-8 seconds.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

ISS not to fly over tonight wed may 18, nor was it a satellite which are visible longer with a reddish hue usually, or a plane unless it turned off all FAA lights, nor a meteorite cause there was never a tail. Visibility was very clear.  Flash was as bright as the ISS flyovers, then dimmed out slowly, slower than a meteorite, was traveling as fast as a commercial airliner but no FAA lights just one solid white ball like, and too big to be a normal commercial airliner at the distance.  Live 10 miles from airport and see flights all the time.  Also, came through right before the brightest star of Virgo.  Also no planes were in the area around St.Louis airport or flying by for the past hour and up to 10:15 pm when I went back inside.

The total time of the visible object was around 30 seconds. I could see the extreme humidity outside was very thick and can only see 1 or 2 visible stars.  After checking the ISS flyovers of St.Louis, there are no orbital paths flying over here until June so it wasn't an ISS flyover or a satellite, because satellites always give off a reddish hue due to the infrared light reflected back off the earth.  Again it was a bright white object started out as a dim light then in the middle of path grew extremely bright as the ISS is and then slowly dimmed out with a speed about as fast as the ISS flyovers are from what I can reference.  There were no FAA lights, just one solid whi! te light, nothing blinking or flashing. No other planes in the sky before or after event.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Circular pattern was irregular, not a perfect circle. About 3 different circular patterns taking approx.  6 and 8 seconds respectively.  Light was only seen within the clouds, when the light entered an area outside of a cloud formation it was not seen.   As the cloud formations began to change or dissipate, the light pattern altered.  Finally after witnessing this for about 25 minutes it reduced from 3 separate circular light patterns to only one. T he pattern of the counter clock wise movement changed as well. Finally, it faded away. This happened about 1 ½ to 2 hours after scattered thunder showers.  At the time of the witnessed light movements, the sky was clearing away.  There was no storm activity not lightning or rain. There was no sound.  No flashing or colored lights.  Only a round white light moving counter-clockwise within the clouds in an asymmetrical round pattern.   If you held your finger to the area in the sky the circular area would be about 5 inches in diameter.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

I was watching tv when I heard a engine noise that sounded like a muffled airplane engine, different then anything I have heard. I go to the back door and look and I see a bright Orange light like planet Mars in color, but brighter, I thought at first it looked like a satellite but moving much slower than one,   Also I notice there was a hazy sky and the object appeared lower than the hazy clouds. And there was a full moon.  I call my wife and say check out this light in the sky, she looks out and says what the hell is that, I don't know I grab my binoculars, I have two pairs my good pair is 25x100 I use for astronomy.  Even in the binocs I cant see any detail, just a Orange light, no flashing lights, no outline of a typical aircraft at night.   Too think it passed directly overhead of my home, with the engine noise I know it wasn't a satellite and with no flashing lights it wasn't a plane or helicopter.  We live on a hill and watched it for almost ten minutes, slow moving, steady heading south in a straight line, then when it was a good two miles away it turned red my wife yelled to me did you see it just change color I said yes,. I can't believe we are watching this thing. We watched it for about 10 min before it disappeard off the horizon. We can see about 6 miles with our hilltop view.  I thought maybe its a drone of some kind so the next day I reported it to the police and they said they have no drones in the county so they tell me to report it to the FAA. I called and they say they don't know of any drones operating in Missouri at all. I don't know if they are telling the truth or not.

They were not moving in a perfect line looked very erratically.  If you held your hand out at arms length and used your index finger and thumb to gauge distance, there was about 2in. between the top 2 and bottom 2. When they all reached a certain point they faded out.  They didn't turn out like a switch, it was a slow fade out.  After the first 4 all disappeared, 2 more followed.  These 2 were side by side about 3-4in. apart.  Same exact thing, they faded out at exactly the same point the first 4 did. I tried to record with my phone, however I was in an industrial park.  The building across the street had lights along the roof.  They were barely visible on the phone recording. At first I thought they may have been a plane coming into a landing pattern.  A plane came in approx. 30-45 sec. after the last 2 disappeared it had 5 white lights and a red/green flashing.  Also you could hear the plane. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.

The light also appeared to have a very faint flashing light attached to it.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Two bright lights near Milky Way traveling north in St. Louis, MO.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-09 20:30:00;20 seconds;Two bright lights near Milky Way traveling north in St. Louis, Missouri. My brother and I last night where coincidentally are not so coincidentally discussing a recent report that came out from some Harvard scientists claiming that radio frequencies from deep space could be the signature of alien space travel.  Just minutes after we talked about this, I looked up towards the Milky Way and song ((sic.  saw)) two bright stars that I had never seen before near the bowl of the Milky Way.  I realized that they were travelling together heading north.  I told my brother to look and he saw them as well.  They didn't make any erratic movements but they slowly dimmed until they were invisible to the naked eye. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites, being illuminated by the Sun, would not dim, as they traveled to the north.

Lights in the sky and abduction.;2020-04-26 02:30:00;about 1 hour;Lights in the sky and abduction. I was laying in bed and had a funny feeling come over me. I gazed out my bedroom window and saw two shining lights moving silently. I have seen these lights often, The first time I saw them I was 13 years old. Every time I see them I get sick the next day and dream that I'm in a medical facility. What is strange is that when I am there I'm in a room and come out to see where I am at, and it looks like a hospital setting and there is nurses there. They tell me that I'm okay and to go back into my room. I don't really now what is happening to me.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
