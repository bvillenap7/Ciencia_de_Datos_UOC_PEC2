I saw a very bright, silent, white light rapidly flashing on and off. It did not move at all. I observed it at about 10:00 pm. It was still in the exact same spot flashing on and off at 3:30 am. It was not a planet because planets don't blink on and off and it was not a helicopter because it did not move at all.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

PD));2011-11-29 22:42:00;hasn't ended.;Walked outside...seen green and blue lights flashing so rapidly....no shape as far as I can see. I heard people talking about it on facebook.  I thought nothing of it. I finally went outside and looked under Orien's Belt...there it was.... I cant assess the shape..its very far away..close to the horizon. its flashing blue, and green very very fast.  Almost like a strobe light. Its been there for an hour. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Sirius.  We received several calls from St. Louis about what we concluded was the star, Sirius, rising above the eastern horizon.  PD));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Flashes of Light;2016-09-27 21:00:00;10 seconds;Flashes of Light Around 9pm Central time, I was outside looking up at the sky, when I saw a very quick flash of a greenish transparent circular in shape light, swipe across the clear night sky.   I continued to watch the sky and turn towards the North East and then saw a fireball tipped light followed by a trail of white, flash cross the sky in about a 7 second time frame.   Nothing else was seen for the next 15 minutes as I waited for anything else.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

I was around 9 years old when this occurred, we heard a loud vibrational noise kind of like a light bulb. I looked up and saw what I thought was a helicopter, I then told my father to look up and as he did it flashed a huge light over our yard. About 3 seconds later it flew off across the night sky. When I think of it I remember helicopters can't go that close to the ground, and I know for a fact drones are not that big.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Bright blue silent flash lights up eastern sky.;2019-04-25 23:04:00;2 seconds;Bright blue silent flash lights up eastern sky. My husband and I live on the river bluff in St. Louis city.  We were looking due east and saw a bright blue silent flash light up the sky.  It wasnâ€™t coming from up or down it came from the middle of the sky.  The location of the flash would be directly over illinois.  It lit up the whole sky.  Have never ever seen anything like this before.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
