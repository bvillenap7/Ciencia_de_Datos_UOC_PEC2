Sitting in the backyard reading when I noticed a dark shape against the clouds...again!!;1991-09-01 16:00:00;1min approx;Sitting in the backyard reading when I noticed a dark shape against the clouds...again!! I was sitting in the back yard reading when I noticed a dark shape coming through the clouds. Only a week before we had seen a rectangular craft gliding over our house and here it was again. My husband was napping, my mother, who lived next door would not be quick enough to get outside as a witness and I could never get my camera before it went out of sight. I just decided to enjoy it. I stood and watched it take the reverse path that it flew the week before.  This time I heard all the city noise that was appropriate for that time of day. I really could not estimate its size. The only real description I can give is a flat black rectangle. As a UFO investigator of over 20 years years...you'd think Id know when to follow a hunch!  Anyone else seeing a black rectangle or other unusual craft is welcome to contact us at Missouri Investigators Group at M.I.G@usa.com or me personally at B.Becker@iname.com ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Barbara Becker and the Missouri Investigation Group for submitting the report.

Witnessed a black rectangle go over our house...;1991-09-01 17:30:00;3 minutes appox.;Witnessed a black rectangle go over our house... It was a Saturday afternoon and my husband and I were laying on the livingroom floor watching the evening news. The TV was backed by a large window facing east. We both noticed a dark object silhouetted against the clouds. As it appoached we could see the shape as a rectangle. We both jumped up to get a better look. I told him to keep watching the object and I ran through the house to the backdoor, which was its projected path.  When I got outside I looked where it should have been and then where it had been and it was not visible to me. It was strangely quiet. I was looking overhead and to the west over a three story apartment building directly behind the house when I heard the roar of an engine (I have hesitated all these years to admit this)and before my eyes, appearing to just miss the top of the apartment building was a commercial airliner as though it appeared out of some other dimension. To say I was dumbstruck would be an understatement. My husnad reported that he watched the rectangle till he lost sight of it over the house. In reinacting the scene and checking the timing, I should have seen it as well, which I didnt. He on the other hand did not hear the roar of the jet, that I did. I have no idea what I witnessed that day, but I had a feeling I would see it again. Of course I didnt believe that feeling which was a big mistake.

Black rectangle hovering;2006-07-17 07:15:00;10 minutes;Black rectangle hovering Driving east on Rt 364 just west of I-270 a little after 7am when a black rectangle appeared about 30 degrees up from the horizon and in the south / southeast sky.  The rectangle just hovered in the sky.  After about two minutes the shape dimished in shape and eventually disappeared.  About 30 seconds later a bright white cloud appeared in the same place that was likely a reflection of the sun.  Seconds later the rectangular shape turned black again hovering in the same place.  After about 10 minutes the shape simply disappeared.  The sky was clear and their were no aircraft in the area.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Two square/rectangular red crafts spotted above St. Louis on July 4th.;2009-07-04 21:15:00;2 min;Two square/rectangular red crafts spotted above St. Louis on July 4th. On July 4th, 2009, myself and four other family members and friends were on our front porch watching fireworks coming from the next suburb East of us, approximately two or three miles away.  In the middle of the show, a bit past 21:15 we noticed a red, almost square shape high in the Northern sky above St. Louis county,  a somewhat higher altitude than airplanes that arrive into Lambert Airport, it continued to rise at a very quick pace faster than regular aircraft a minute later in the direction of the fireworks display, the same size red square shaped craft  rose from the tree-line straight up at an unbelievable fast pace and then angled towards the other red square now hovering high in the sky. All of us on the porch witnessed it, at first a couple people thought the second one was a hot air balloon but within seconds of it rapidly rising faster into the atmosphere than even airplanes do that theory was discounted it was clear it was not any type of balloon or regular aircraft, we lost visual contact of both crafts in the clouds as it had rained about 10 minutes prior.  Both were identical, almost square, and possibly slightly rectangular, with a very small light at one corner. Visual contact lasted about two minutes in duration.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Enormous strobing rectangle lights moving across the sky at extremely high speed.  ((anonymous report));2018-12-02 18:00:00;5 seconds;Enormous strobing rectangle lights moving across the sky at extremely high speed Huge.  I mean absolutely enormous.  The light flashing appeared to be as large as 15-20 Tower beacons.  White not red.  It flew in from the direction of S. Louisiana St. towards S. Compton.  Was extremely loud, and sounded like a missle.  Was flashing like a strobe light and moved faster than any jet or airplane I've ever seen.  It took literally seconds to move from out of sight in one direction to out of sight in the other direction.  It is cloudy outside.  No stars to be mistaken, and the light was still so bright it was blinding, making it hard to even see the shape.  Immediately afterwards, you could hear aircraft in the sky, as if trailing it.

One elongated, rectangular, drone-like UFO with red and green blinking lights traveling West well above the treeline.;2019-01-04 00:15:00;20 seconds;One elongated, rectangular, drone-like UFO with red and green blinking lights traveling West well above the treeline. Moments after putting my car in park after coming home (having used no substances and being well rested), I glanced out of my window and saw one rectangular, drone-like object with red and green lights throughout the body traveling West well above the treeline.  Lights flickered but no quicker than the tick of a clock.   I opened my car door and refocused my eyes while standing and watched the craft travel at a constant speed until it was out of sight in the suburban landscape.  I could see one steady trail via the lights of the UFO.  Its shape was an elongated rectangle--perhaps a 1:4 ratio length to width traveling nose first.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
