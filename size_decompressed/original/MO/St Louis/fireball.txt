Small meteor like object streaked across sky but did not lose brilliance or speed.	;1999-11-16 18:00:00;1 min;Small meteor like object streaked across sky but did not lose brilliance or speed.	 At 6:00 pm on tuesday the 16th me and a friend saw a blue-green object streak across the sky at a MUCH higher rate than any plane or other manmade object (which were also in the sky at the time, I used them for reference). The streak appeared to be a meteorite at first, because of the upcoming lenoid meteor showers, but it did not lose brilliance or change color as it streaked across the sky. It kept the same speed and shape and color and size as it flew from West to East, following the path of I-64/40. The object dissapeared over the horizon after about a minute. It continued through the trees, which was obvious because we could see it.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Fire ball shooting across the sky from west to east at a 30 degree angle;1999-11-16 18:05:00;7-10 seconds;Fire ball shooting across the sky from west to east at a 30 degree angle I was standing outside when a friend said, What the hell is that?  I turned to look and there was this green colored fireball shooting across the sky.  It was to the north of us and heading from west to east. At first I thought it was an airplane crashing to the ground.  I was waiting for an explosion.  It never came.  It disappeared beyond the horizon.  Later that night, we heard on the radio that many people had seen it in this area.  From Missouri to Illinois.  I've seen meteors and this was no meteor.  I don't think it was a UFO under anythings control either.  More like space junk.  It was huge and moving slow in a straight line.  Size of a quarter at arms length.  FANTASTIC!  Sparkles emitted.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Teardrop with largeest part in the front tailing off to the rear. There seemed to be red nose to white tail.  It was hard to guess how high it was but I can only guess at about 10,000 feet or so. It was the first time that I have ever seen any thing like this that was not seen when I was in the Army.  It did look like a Rocket. I don't know if anyone reports back to me or not but that would be nice. Regards--------;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Fireballs in St. Louis;2005-10-28 18:15:00;1 hour;Fireballs in St. Louis Small black dots were followed by short trails of fire.   There were about twenty going in all different directions.  They looked like meteors except that they weren't going towards the ground.   One larger one was black in the center and had white on both sides.  They were seen for miles and miles off in the distance over 1-44 in St. Louis.   The closest ones seemed to be followed by short trails of fire, but they didn't go anywhere.

7 floating orbs or fireballs moving from southwest to northeast direction.;2010-01-01 00:00:00;1 min;7 floating orbs or fireballs moving from southwest to northeast direction. My family and friends who were over for a new years eve party went outside and saw 7 floating fireballs or orangish yellow orbs floating in formation about 500 ft traveling from soutwest to north east.  These were not helicopters nor planes from what we saw.  There was no sound what so ever. No flashing red or green lights on the sides.   I was about half a mile and looked as if it flew over a nearby park that closes at 10 pm.  I am not sure what these were, but they were bright.  I did not see any flickering like a candle or flare.  They were very strange.  I tried to get the camera working for a picture and the camera would not respond.  The batteries were drained and I just put new batteries in the camera a couple hours before.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Group of Orange Fireballs sighted in South City Saint Louis.;2011-07-19 21:45:00;10 minutes;Group of Orange Fireballs sighted in South City Saint Louis. I observed approximately 10-12 roughly sphere shaped masses that appeared to be burning, they were bright and were glowing orange with red and yellow color inconsistently visible.  They appeared from my east and seemed to be traveling northwest.  They appeared approximately one minute apart and varied in size.  They seemed to be traveling relatively slowly and made no noise.   I called my husband and also my neighbor and they witnessed the last 5 or so of the burning balls ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
8-10 lights following each other;2011-10-15 23:00:00;2-4 minutes;8-10 lights following each other I was on my friends back porch and like always I'm looking at the stars (great view) and in the distance over the trees I see a light.  It looked like it was pulsating and then slowly faded in the distance.  But not but 10 seconds later from the tree line 1 mile away another orange light same idea brighter though lifted up and away, but then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 started following that 1 that came out of the tree line.  At certain areas in the sky it looked like it was forming a half circle then they would fade away and then 6 then 7 then 8 coming from the same distance would rise and take that exact same route.  I actually called the police to ask if anybody else reported weird lights...no body.  But myself and a friend saw the same thing!  Funny part is back in June of 2010 I was at my house and I saw the EXACT same thing!  Any further information witness or educated would be greatly appreciated.

Glowing orange balls of light moving silently throught the sky;2012-07-12 21:30:00;5 minutes;glowing orange balls of light moving silently throught the sky At about 9:30 pm., July 12, 2012,  I saw a large, glowing, orange fireball in the sky.  It was traveling at a moderate speed.  It approached from the southeast, and continued across the sky in a northwestern  direction.  I watched until it was out of sight.  Not a sound was heard. This is not the first time I have seen this.  At about 12:10 am. July 5, 2012, my husband and I both witnessed the following:   Two large balls of light, one glowing orange, and the other, white, approached from the southeast.  They appeared to be traveling together (but clearly not connected physically).   We rushed to our front yard to get a better look as they were passing directly overhead.  The white one was now in the lead slightly. It passed over in total silence.  Then the orange one passed overhead.  The glowing orange light seems to come from within.  We both noticed that it had a slight teardrop shape.  This one also passed over in complete silence.  They both went off in a northwesterly direction.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Orange Uidentified Light STL Sky.;2013-07-25 22:38:00;1 minute;Orange Uidentified Light STL Sky. I went outside to let my dogs out and move my sprinkler when I noticed an orange ball in the sky.  It immediately caught my attention, especially since it was something I've never seen before.  I work for an airline and I am VERY familiar with aviation so I was immediately curious as to what this was since it did not resemble any aircraft (no flashing becons, wing lights) and most aircraft in either a approach or takeoff phase are white in color not orange. I watched it in awe for a moment then ran inside to get my phone to try and record the occurrence. I was able to record about 30 seconds of the light move from one direction then the opposite direction then literally disappear.  I noted the position and information in the sky and have this information available.  I will submit this information in an email (subject STL07252013).;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Bright orange spheres/fireballs passing over my house.;2014-05-01 19:35:00;5-6 minutes;Bright orange spheres/fireballs passing over my house. Tonight (May 1st, 2014) I had friends over.  After they all left and I straightened up a bit, I stepped outside onto my deck.  My neighbor moved out of her house yesterday so I was curious to see if there were any lights on in the back of the house which would indicate that the new neighbors were there.  (It was between 10:33 and 10:35 PM).   I look up and passing over my house there is a bright round orange orb/light.  This night is cloudy so perhaps the object was distorted?  BUT as crazy as this might sound, it looked like it had something attached to the backside of it (as I viewed it going past my line of vision).  The something looks like an orange transparent sack/bubble like the UFO/ORB was pulling or dragging it.   I ran inside the house to call my kids but decided it was too late THEN went back outside only to see another one passing over my house.  This time I did call my daughter-in-law on the cordless phone.  She went outside but was not able to see it.  The first one to pass over my house looked like something was attached but the second one did not.  Both are a glowing orange.  The first one was so bright I thought it was going to crash and that the appendage was actually fire.  Apparently, I was wrong since I watched it move out view.    Both were silent and moved at the same speed as an airplane.  I would say they were airplanes distorted by cloud coverage BUT they were such a bright burning orange, completely silent and with orange being the only visible color...  There might have been one before I stepped outside but missed it.  Tonight their direction went from WEST to EAST (both of them).;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Red fireball light orb seen high up in neighbors yard in Maplewood of St. Louis County.;2014-05-06 22:30:00;2 seconds;Red fireball light orb seen high up in neighbors yard in Maplewood of St. Louis County. Red fireball type light orb in neighbors backyard.  It was up as high as their 3rd story/pitched attic near the corner of Greenwood and St. Elmo.  It fell or moved downward. Approximately 1 foot or smaller diameter.  I was sitting in our yard with my husband around 10:30 p.m. facing towards their yard.  Unfortunately he was facing the other direction.  I walked over to the edge of our yard afterwards and checked out their yard for a bit.  No one was out there, no bon fire, nothing.  Was excited I got to see it.  Unsure where it went.  Previously at around the age of 10 or so (1992) witnessed a white glowing orb 1 foot in diameter.  It pulled up to my passenger side window as we were driving down the highway and it followed along side us for a few moments.  This was on highway 44 near where the old gas reservoirs used to be near Maplewood and Shrewsberry.  My mother was driving and also witnessed it.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
A dozen fire colored lights move in straight pattern 6 at a time like a squadron, then fade away.;2014-10-11 23:00:00;7 minutes;A dozen fire colored lights move in straight pattern 6 at a time like a squadron, then fade away. I was with a few family members outside at the fire pit in back yard.  When I looked up above my house and saw very bright reddish almost fire light.  Object was moving straight in my direction, coming from downtown.   Then I saw another, and another.  In about 10 seconds, there was a straight line of 6 of these lights.   I yelled and pointed, What is that?  My 3 family members all saw the objects.   The objects were equidistant away from each other moving at a steady pace right overhead, about the height of a plane coming in for a landing, but kept their pattern true.  The objects slowly faded out at about the same spot in the sky.   A minute or two later, 5 or 6 more fiery objects came moving in, almost same straight pattern, but slightly askew.  There was no noise from these objects.  They just kept there course.   This time I watched very closely to see when they faded out and noticed when the light faded, a black silhouette in the shape of a triangle seemed to ascend out of sight.   A few minutes later, 2 more appeared and quickly disappeared.   We didn't know what to think.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

I have a new scar on my armpit. Two of my friends and I were walking to one of our friends house when i looked up and saw the big dipper.  Then just a little farther to the left i saw a glowing ball of light moving across the sky.  Then i said look and both friends looked up.  The one of them said its another.  As we watched them, one stopped and another bypassed as if it thought the other one was a star. Then when the second ufo as ahead about 10 ft. away, the first ufo changed directions and went the opposite way of the second one.  Then they both disappeared. As we continued on i looked up in a different direction, I saw a huge grey triangle in the sky with a red light in the middle of the bottom and three blue lights on the tips.  It was moving across the sky quietly, then another appeared farther to the right.  It looked the same as the first triangle one, but instead of silence it as loud like a jet.  My two friends went inside, then both ufo hovered for about two minutes.  One disappeared, ! while the other hovered above me.  I then fell asleep.  Then my friends came back outside and said I was inactive (non responsive) for the first 30 seconds when they came back outside.  I dont remember being inactive but i remember going to sleep. Now i have a new scar on the under part of my armpit. I still have the scar.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Green fireball over St. Louis.;2017-03-21 20:15:00;10 seconds;Green fireball over St. Louis My partner and I were out driving at around 8:15pm last night (March 22nd, 2017) when we both witnessed and unexplainable object fall through the sky.  It started off with my partner seeing what they claim to be a bright flash in the sky.   Less than two minutes later, we both watched what appeared to be an orb of some kind falling through the sky above us, heading south at a fast pace.  It was glowing bright green and the emitted light increased in intensity until it seemed to just burn up and fade away, leaving no real trail behind it, or any evidence that it was ever there to begin with.   This all happened within a matter of five to ten seconds, leaving us searching for similar objects for the rest of the night.   There was no sign of anything ever hitting the ground, and no reports of anything have come up throughout today.   Neither of us have ever seen anything remotely similar to this, though I have seen other unexplainable objects they never fell this quickly.   Unfortunately, because of the randomness of this event, we did not capture any photos.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
