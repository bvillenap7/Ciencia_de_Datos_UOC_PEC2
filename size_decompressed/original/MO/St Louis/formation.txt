Formation of 9-12 points of light with another object in the middle covered with five lights in a diamond pattern.;2008-12-31 23:45:00;2 minutes;Formation of 9-12 points of light with another object in the middle covered with five lights in a diamond pattern. On New Years around 23:45, my girlfriend and I were outside on an open patio of an eight story building on Washington Ave. in downtown St. Louis.  We were on the South side of the building facing south, when we both noticed a formation of lights.  The speed of the formation and altitude was steady and resembled what one would expect from airplanes heading toward Lambert International airport.  The formation was composed of points of light that looked just like stars, approximately 9 points of light with a tight cluster in the middle of this formation that appeared to be one object with five points of white lights on it that were in a diamond pattern.  The position of the points of light did not appear to change.  The formation was traveling towards the northwest.  We had eyes on it for approximately two minutes and lost sight of it because of the view to the west is obstructed by the buildings design.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
6 glowing orange lights with a center blue light seen in St. Louis;2009-09-18 22:30:00;2 min;6 glowing orange lights with a center blue light seen in St. Louis I stepped outside and noticed a formation of 6 glowing orange lights in the Northeastern sky.  In the middle of the lights was a bright blue that traversed across the sky in a Southwestern course. The orange lights were constant glowing like a campfire although it did not flicker.  It was very primative looking with a very dull glow to it.  They were individually points in what appeared to be in the shape of a stretched out hexagon, or a holly leaf.  They all seemed to be traveling at the same speed and in the same pattern, and same direction.  I estimate that they were 4-6 ft tall. The formation traveled between 75-100 ft off of the ground. I was traveling about 200 mph/322 kmh.  All together they would have stretched across 3 football fields.  I noticed I could see through it.  I was able to see things through the “UFO” as it crossed the sky I could watch a stars and a plane in the distance behind the object as it passed by.  As if it was not there at all except for the lights. The blue light was in the direct center.   This light was very precise and very high-tech looking like an LED light. This light would normally pass as a star, but it stayed in the same formation as the other lights, it traveled in the same direction, and stayed in the direct center.  It also seemed to be pulsating slowly. The only reason that this struck me as a possible “UFO” is that when the lights disappeared, they all dimmed at the same time.  They did not disappear one at a time, like it was going into a cloud bank. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Circling lights in sky above St. Louis.   ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));2012-08-04 04:00:00;45 minutes;Circling lights in sky above St. Louis My wife woke me at 0400 to see if I saw the same thing in the sky that she was seeing.   A pattern of lights in the clouds rotating and focusing at a lower point in the horizon.  No beam of light was visible from below to give an indication that it was a search light array.  Over the course of time the focus point moved lower to the horizon as if moving away and became harder to detect.    At one point it seemed like more than four lights, moving around in the sky.

Orange Red formation of 7 craft hovering over St. Louis, Mo.;2013-06-01 23:00:00;15 minutes;Orange Red formation of 7 craft hovering over St. Louis, Mo. Red circles in a patterned formation hovering over St. Louis, I have pictures and video of this event.  They were two triangle formations and one in the center.  Since we were on the highway, we took a lot of photos and two videos of these craft.  They are NOT flares.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Six white  lights above St. Louis.;2013-08-10 22:48:00;~2 minutes;Six white  lights above St. Louis. Six lights in two semi-triangular formations above telegraph.  Pulled over to get a closer look, by the time we got out of the car, four of the lights were gone, one disappeared shortly thereafter, and the final   one contined flying north and eventually disappeared into what seemed like thin air.  Never seen anything like it.   I'm an extreme skeptic, but my brother in law and I already ruled out any kind of mechanical aircraft.  There was no noise and it was moving way too fast to have been at a very high altitude. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Cluster of silver orbs fading in and out of view.;2013-10-12 15:00:00;15+ minutes;Cluster of silver orbs fading in and out of view 	At approximately 3:00 P.M. on Saturday, October 12th, a cluster of spherical objects were observed in the Eastern skies of the Sunset Hills area of South St. Louis County.  My boyfriend's family and I were preparing to leave a local school after a soccer game, when one of his relatives pointed out these weird balloons in the sky.  As we watched closer, we noticed that unlike helium balloons, these objects were not gaining altitude.  They appeared to be hovering and slightly moving southward in the sky.  I would estimate that there were at least 50 small silver spherical objects. 	As we stared at them, they faded in and out as if the sun was reflecting off and on.  The sky was clear, so there was no obvious reason for this discrepancy in reflection.  As they faded in and out, they seemed to make new formations.  To me, the fading in and out was like a star that you can only see through peripheral vision, but not when looking straight at it.  This incident occurred for 10 or 15 minutes.  They were still in the sky as we were leaving the school.  Numerous others saw the objects in the sky.  One person commented that it was behaving like a school of fish in the sky.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Saw 2 bright white orbs while driving.;2017-04-06 19:40:00;30 seconds;Saw 2 bright white orbs while driving. At approximately 7:40 p.m., Central standard time, while driving, I witness 2 bright orbs flying in formation. I initially thought that the orbs were the lights of an aircraft, but I did not see the flashing red usually located beneath commercial aircraft.   As I proceeded to drive down the road, I had stopped at a stoplight.  At the stop, the orbs became obstructed from my view for less than 30 seconds, but during the seconds the orbs disappeared.   There is a field along the road past the stoplight that provides an unobstructed view of the sky.  I looked around for the orbs or any aircraft that could be the cause of the sighting, but I saw nothing in the sky.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
