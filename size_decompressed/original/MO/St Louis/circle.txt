There is also a small power station under where the object was seen. After about one and a half minutes object slid down on its side and slowly moved towards the west showing a different viewing angle which was like a cigar shape,then picked up speed and in about 4 seconds was gone. The best discription i can give would be like an eightball without the 8 or like the BLACK SUN EMBLEM drawn by White Feather. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.

2 objects in the sky with bright lights moving fast and then stopping on a dime.;2005-04-15 21:00:00;15 minutes;2 objects in the sky with bright lights moving fast and then stopping on a dime. I was on the phone with my mom on 4/15. She said she had to go, then she called me back about an half an hour later. She told me she was watching out at the sky when she noticed what appeared to be 2 bright stars, as she watched the lights started moving in different directions and then stopping on a dime. So she got her video camera out and started recording what she saw. She had discribed the objects to me, she said they had lights, and one would move up and down. I believe in ufo's but I thought yea right mom.  So I went to visit my mom on sunday and she took this video out and showed me the video and what I saw was so amazing I couldnt believe my eyes. She video tapped these 2 ojects in the sky they looked like stars like she said but they would move very fast and then slow down. When she did a close up you could see lights on either side of the object like it was going around it, it looked like they were circle, but when she got real close when she zoomed in the oject looked like it wasnt there but you could see what i can only discribe as a very faint circle with like a hole on the middle. And then they disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the source of the report to share the tape with NUFORC, so we can review it.  PD));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
((HOAX))  i was abducted;2008-01-15 23:00:00;1 hour;i was abducted   I was walking my dog on my late night jog and all of a sudden I saw a large circular object over head.  So i ignored it at first and just kept walking and then it swooped down and landed about 1/2 mile in front of me.  I just kept walking and ignored it and got up to it, it was about 50 yards across.  I was just going to walk by and i was sucked into it.  They started poking me with sticks with red probes on the end and my dog too.  Thats all I remember and then I was just back walking where I was and the ship was gone.  It was 23:05 when i got off and it seemed like hours.

A luminous greenish circle was visible 2 seconds going fast out and then into clouds near St. Louis, MO;2011-06-02 20:50:00;2 seconds;A luminous greenish circle was visible 2 seconds going fast out and then into clouds near St. Louis, MO I was leaving the St. Louis County Library at 8:50 PM on June 2nd.  I was at the headquarters on Lindbergh, just south of the 64/40 highway. No other person was in the parking lot at that moment. The sky to my eyes was cloudy, with some gaps containing haze.  I saw an object moving in the north/northeast sky, moving north/northwest for about 1-2 seconds.  The speed was greater than a conventional airplane.   The object caught my attention because of its size, which appeared to be the size of a significant fraction of the moon if that had been visible, about a 1/3 visible moon size.  Most striking was the bluish green color, not a deep strong color but more of a shade of white.   The object emerged from a cloud, passed through I believe some haze because the outline was not sharply distinct, and was gone into another cloud.  I did not hear any sound.   I have not heard any mention on the local radio.  I realize this could have been a meteor just before impact, but it sure looked totally different from any shooting star I ever have seen before.
