Highley reflective silver oval/disk seen in sky above St. Louis, MO 6/6/00;2000-06-06 17:22:00;one minute;Highley reflective silver oval/disk seen in sky above St. Louis, MO 6/6/00 I am a 26 year old Transportation manager and dipatcher and I was driving home from work, going west on Highway 64/40 in St. Louis city and I saw a very shinny light, reflecting in the distance. I assumed it was an airplane until I saw two other airplanes flying in the vacinity, one in front of the object and one behind the object and realized they were moving but this light was not, and then it flashed, like a reflecting flash, but much brighter than any reflections off the other two planes in the area, and then I noticed it was somewhat like a flat oval shape and silvery and pure white when it flashed, very clear and pure color(silver and white) compared to the two airplanes in the area....it looked like it was hovering(stationary) flashed two lights towards me and then vanished...it could not have gone behind any clouds because it was a crystal clear sky...and the sun was still fairly high in the sky. When I looked at my clock in the car it was 5:22. When I could not see it anymore it was 5:23 I could not believe it. My first sighting of something I can't explain. This is the truth. I don't know what it was. The flashes of reflecting light were so bright compared to the other two planes in the area it was like a floodlight next to a candle.......I hope this helps. I don't know if anyone else saw it on the highway or not.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

We would like to know more about what it was you witnessed this evening.  You describe it as an oval, but there are many objects that could fit that description.  Was it self-luminous, for example, or was it dark, or unlighted? What was its size, relative to a full moon, or the disc of the sun, for example?  Any color to it?          Thank you for sharing the information with our Center!          Cordially,          Peter Davenport ((END QUERY)) ((BEGIN RESPONSE))       It was self-luminous. The clouds reflected its glow as it passed by and thru the clouds on its departure. Estimate size is difficult as we are all still sicky-feeling. Guesstimate size baseballl if held at armslength. Very white, not colored, possibly goldish.Casual in its display, then moved on to other places things. In command, not worried that we see it. We are all very quiet now. This party is over and the girls won't go home now because they are afraid. We're all around fifty years old, we know better. Nobody is saying ((deleted)) to anybody else. Took us awhile to think up netting you with a message. Oh well, another day on planet earth. ((END RESPONSE));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
