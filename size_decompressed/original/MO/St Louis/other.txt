We discovered what appeared to be a huge floating city directly above us about 30 to 50 feet. (Not sure of exact date in 1993);1993-05-01 13:00:00;60 seconds;We discovered what appeared to be a huge floating city directly above us about 30 to 50 feet. (Not sure of exact date in 1993) I am 52 years old, and it has been many years since I have even thought of this.   One day in 1993 on a clear sunny day my brother who was 26 at the time and I, who was 28, had a sighting.  As stated earlier it was during the day when my brother and I was standing in our driveway, in a heavy populated part of the city.  When we noticed that the sounds of everyday life had vanished and the day became shaded prompting us to look up.  At that moment we discovered what appeared to be a huge floating city directly above us about 30 to 50 feet, with no distinctive geometric shape.  That approached without making a sound.  There was no visible points of engines exhausts.  It was dark in color, not smooth in shape, with unknown markings, and what appeared to be closed areas that may have been entry points.  It hovered above us for about 60 seconds before we witnessed it streaking across the sky and disappearing with no effort for something that large.  We stood there in amazemen! t for another minute before two twin propelled helicopters came through on the same path.  That had no chance at all and was no where near being close to the craft because of the clumsy and awkwardness of our military aircraft.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
We had just moved into our new home and could not sleep.

At approx. 3:00 a.m. I noticed a glowing object in the eastern sky at about horizon level.  It was far enough away that when it moved around, the telephone and electrical wires were hiding it.  My husband asked me if I saw it and I told him yes.  We did not have the camcorder or binoculars unpacked, but we did have the site from his telescope.  You could see that the thing was changing colors from white to blue to green.  We live very close to an airport (practically at the end of the runway) and noted that there was no airplane activity.  This is very unusual for Lambert Field.  The next night at about the same time my husband and a friend saw the same light, but this time there were approx 3 objects doing the same thing as the night before.  They were convinved thath what they saw that night was a UFO.  My husband said they were much more active thath night than the night before when we saw it together.  I do not be! lieve it was a star and we have discussed if it was possible to be some type of new aircraft that McDonnell/Boeing could be testing.  We heard no noise or saw any other activity.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
UFO hovering over Mississippi river near St. Louis.;2000-06-16 23:30:00;3 minutes;UFO hovering over Mississippi river near St. Louis. My Mom and a friend were returning home, crossing the Mckinley Bridge into Illinois. As they began to cross the bridge, they saw a large, non-moving object hovering in the sky. The object was above the bridge. They stopped and watched it for a minute or so. They said it was perfectly still, at a height where a very low flying plane would be and heard no sound. Both claimed it was difficult to make out an exact shape - but drew me a picture and described it. They saw two large glowing circular lights (white) on the side, and said they were attached to a long cigar shaped body. They had difficulty describing what attached the lights to the body. I asked what made them think it was not a helicopter and they said it was WAY too large and remained perfectly still - plus what happened next. They decided to keep moving and the passenger was looking out the rear window at the object. She lost track of the object briefly and saw it just in time to watch it streak across the sky at incredible speed. She said it stopped instantly over the Mississippi at a point South of their current position. They continued home.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Lines in the Sky, Seen from Airplane;2003-03-28 10:00:00;10 min;Lines in the Sky, Seen from Airplane I was on a commercial flight from Washington DC to the SF Bay area in California. We were about ten minutes flight time away from St. Louis heading west, flying at about 30,000ft. I was gazing out the window on the plane when I noticed something like markings in the sky. It looked as if someone had taken a pencil and drawn a line in the sky. From my perspective the dark black line was about two centimeters in length, but there's no telling what distance it was from us. I woke up the passenger sitting next to me on the flight to make sure I wasn't seeing things. He saw it too, but shrugged it off saying, Yeah, that's pretty strange. I didn't know what to do so I simply watched it for a bit longer. A second one appear right above it around that same time. Within 10 minutes, they were out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder if the witness was observing the shadow cast by the contrail behind a jet aircraft.  Just a guess.  PD));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Chesterfield, MO UFO;2005-03-03 22:15:00;10 sec;Chesterfield, MO UFO Standing behind Dominos, facing Spirit of St. Louis Airport (small airfield).  About 500 yards out. Horizontaly crossing the runway, which I was faced parallel towards. About 1 1/2 quarters long. Pyramid shaped body, about five stars all together. And a three star nose. Travelling about 40 mph. No higher than most helicopters fly. Southwest to Northwest, 1 mile from Missouri river. Almost following up river. The jaw droppingly odd light formation and its silent cruise through darkness was amazing. I do question my recall on this experience. Though, whatever it was. Did take my eyes to great amazement. Now plagued with questions. I continue wonder. I have seen three star diagnal line traveling before. Possible side triangle view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Two shining objects spotted in the day time sky high above St. Louis.;2005-10-25 17:50:00;5 minutes;Two shining objects spotted in the day time sky high above St. Louis. There were two objects high in the daytime sky that looked like stars.  They seemed to reflect the sunlight.  They weren't moving, as much as I could tell.   One simply disappeared as I looked at it, the other disappeared moments later.   They were clearly above the clouds and were in close proximity to one another.  Best guess is that they were round,  but they were too high to tell for sure.   My wife witnessed the one, the second one appeared after she got into the car, we witnessed these objects as we were late to getting out 6 month daughter to her first picture session.  If anybody has seen the footage from Mexico City a few years back, that's what this reminded me of.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
bright long shaped object in sky illuminated by circling spotlight.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2010-12-03 17:00:00;over one hours;bright long shaped object in sky illuminated by circling spotlight My son went outside to the backyard to take out our dog at 5:30 p.m. and seen a large spotlight circling repeatedly from a distance away.  My son called me and I could see that this large spotlight was circling up into the clouds.   While it was circling clockwise it would pass over a bright long shaped object, illuminating this object in the sky above the clouds.  You could not see the object when the spot light was not shining directly on it.  The clouds were moving but the object remained stationary.  It is now 6:30 p.m. and the spotlight is still circling the sky.  I do not know when the spotlight began circling to detect this object in the sky.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

The object was boomerang shaped (half U Shaped) no sharp angles except for the wing tips which were also more rounded.;2015-11-18 19:20:00;15 seconds;Sighting of two boomerang shaped craft, from the intersection of South Kingshighway Blvd. and Chippewa Street, St. Louis, MO:   The object was boomerang shaped (half U-shaped) no sharp angles, except for the wing tips, which were also more rounded and also in between the wing tips looked to be another smaller boomerang, but looked to be one solid mass (one object)   The craft was silent, no sound emitting, but the most impressive was the camouflage hardly visible, resembling smoke coming off a fire.  I was able to make out the shape and that is was indefinitely a solid mass as it was blocking out the sky on the other side as it was traveling East South East.   And I would approximate the speed at about 35-40 mph if were in my car trying to track it and also at a pretty low altitude.   As the craft looked to be quite large.  The moon was in the back ground, and the object surpassed its size. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the witness on two occasions, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded and sincere.  We suspect that he is a quite reliable witness.
