Neon green cigar shape craft with neon red tail emission traveling noiselessly at high speed .;1995-05-20 23:00:00;3 seconds;Neon green cigar shape craft with neon red tail emission traveling noiselessly at high speed . My coworker and I were standing out on a small balcony on the south side of our control room near the end of our shift as we often did. The night was very overcast and no moon or stars were visible. Our plant is very close to the Mississippi river at only 3 or 4 blocks away. A cigar shaped bright neon green craft with a long neon red emission at the rear dropped down through the clouds moving south right above the river as if to verify its course and just as quickly disappeared back up through the clouds. We slowly turned to look at each other. Each of us almost afraid to admit to each other what we had just seen. There was no noise and it moved very fast. The colors literally glowed like neon does. I have no idea what it was but you could tell it was a craft of some sort. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

I saw no lights no sound and no lines defineing anything. It was like a shadow about 50-150 miles away,ten oclock high.my self and coworker watched it about 45 seconds. It slowly faded from site,never changing speed or direction.My gut feeling at the time was  {for lack of better words Ill use star trek lingo}the shadow was cloaking something inside. Myself and coworker are in our 40's and work at A lighting company. My guess at altitudeis 20-40 thousand feet.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Black spot low on South St. Louis sky;2008-08-10 13:45:00;20-30 mins;Black spot low on South St. Louis sky I've never seen or reported anything like this before.   I was just sitting in a parking lot talking to a friend and noticed a black line in the sky.  We were on S.Kingshighway about a mile north of Chippewa.  It was very small and I could barely see it but my friend saw it as well.  It never moved.  Not one time.   There were clouds, black and white, moving behind it at a slow speed.  But the shape never moved.  It stayed there for a long time.  I thought it must be a weather balloon.  However, it never moved.  As I said, the clouds were moving but the black shape never moved.  It appeared very small, since it must have been below the clouds in the atmosphere.  It was tall and skinny.  I watched it for about 30 minutes.  I did take a picture with my cell phone, however it was so tiny, I don't believe it showed up. I moved to another location about 100 yards away and could still see it.  I finally had to go, but I couldn't find it again when I got home.  It freaked me out a bit, so I started looking on the news sites and didn't find anything about it.  Dont' know... just felt I should tell someone.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
