Red light from outside lights up the my bedroom.;1978-07-26 18:30:00;minutes;Red light from outside lights up the my bedroom. I am going on memory. My niece and I were playing the game Clue in my room when we were kids. She is 6 years younger than I. So, based on the fact that she was old enough to understand the game, and I was not out of elementary school yet, I believe it was 1978. It was also hot outside, so Iit had to be July or August. (I know we were out of school on summer vacation as well.) I entered the date 7/26 based on similar sightings listed at your site for Missouri. At the time, we were in my bedroom. I lived in a two story house. My bedroom window jetted out of the roof, and was on the side of the house. If you looked out it, you would see the top of the roof of the neighbors house. (These were steep pitched roofs...not flat.) We were playing and I looked up at my neice and said, your face is all red, and she said the same thing to me. We looked around and noticed the whole room was lit in red. There was no noise, and being that the window was open and we lived in the city near the Mississippi River we were accustomed to boats, trains, and airplanes form nearby Lambert Airport. So, it was unusual that if it were a red light coming from above i would have expected a helicopter noise, because whatever it was had to be flying low enough to light up my room. in fact, if you understand where my window was, it still baffles me how that much light could light up the room from that angle without it being right out the window.  The next thing I remember is that her and I ran downstairs and I told my mother and my sister (her Mom) we saw a UFO as we ran out the front door to catch a glimpse from the porch. We saw nothing and heard nothing. My sister thought we had made it up until about 20 years later when my niece and I both recalled this story to her.  I reported this originally to MUFON to see if they had similar experiences in St. Louis during the Summer of 1978 and they referred me to this site. It is odd that I can't remember the exact date, but I still have a vivid memory of the event that happened 25 years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
As I looked out from our DC-9 window I saw a huge aircraft.It had rows and rows of brightly lit windows.;1986-06-06 16:30:00;2-3minutes;As I looked out from our DC-9 window I saw a huge aircraft.It had rows and rows of brightly lit windows. I flew with Trans World Airlines in 1986 as a flight attendant. While preparing the cabin for landing the Captain made an announcment to the passengers. If we looked out on the left side of the aircraft we would see space debris. I bent down to look out of the window and I saw a huge craft. One could not see the top or bottom of it. It appeared very close but yet was suppose to be 100 miles away from us. It had rows and rows of brightly lit windows...one row on top of another that went on forever. It slowly passed... going in the opposite direction at an even speed. It was very, very huge as huge as a flying skyscraper turned on it's side! Not one passenger mentioned this thing. My flying partner confirmed what I saw. When I questioned the Captain he said it was space debris.Believe me ...it was not space debris.

inside the house, but could tell it was above us;1997-10-15 22:00:00;1-minute+;inside the house, but could tell it was above us this is so long ago to tell about, but who knows. it was a long time ago and dont know the exact date, but it happened roughly around september to november of 1997. I was at a friends house and we were playing video games. We were in the middle of the game when the electricity went off briefly, flashed back on, and went out again and stayed off for the duration. Several seconds after losing power, a very bright bluish light came in his front windows. My first thought was that a power transformer had exploded outside and the light s were fling sparks. It continued for about 30 seconds to a minutes slowling flashing on and off. It was actually bright enough to cast beams on the floor as the moon would. At the same time that the light was going on, a low 'humming' sound was heard. It actually felt as though it was vibrating my body slightly. At the same time the 'sound' cycled in time with the lights. Fading and picking up. When the incident stopped, the power returned. The game we were playing was actually 'saved' and was not deleted when turned off. It  was not saved. The incident was quick enough that we observed it inside, but afterwards we went outside to seeif there was anything left. His neighbors were all outside as well, and nobody knew what happened. There was no exploded transformer, and nothing on the power poles that could have produced the light. All that I actually witnessed was power loss, light, and 'noise'. Several days later, I talked with my brother who lives in Festus MO. Without telling him what happened, he went on to tell me that the same night, he saw something strange while in Arnold MO. (about 15 miles south of the city limits, 20-22 from where I was) He said something to the effevt that he saw whar looked like 'colored lighning' in the sky to the north of where he was. Like I said, I did not see much, but the entire incident was very unusually and left a mark on my mind. The friend I was with and I continue to refer to it as the'unexplained phenomenon' when we speak of it. I wonder if anyone else reported anything that night. Like i said, other people on the street were outside afterword, and we all wondered what had happened. I never heard anything in the news. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a clarification on the date, since the witness indicates that 15OC97 is an approximate date. The events seem reminiscent of the dramatic sighting that occurred over western Illinois and St. Louis, MO, on 04JL97.));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

I WAS WITH 2 FRIENDS AT A BOAT RAMP AT LAKE WAPPAPELLO MISSOURI>we were fishing very late and well i wasnt really paying attention but then out of the corner of my eye i saw these 2 bright long flashes (as if something the size of a large star just blew up but gradually got brighter until it left an imprint like when you close your eyes you can see it ) and this is what got me looking. then it got dimmer and as it got dimmer it moved up and down zig-zag like it did this for about 2 minutes then it started circling (round and round motion) for the remainder of the time. but meanwhile while all this is happening and we started arguing about what we were seeing. then i noticed right above the treeline a red light that was not there before. this inturn took our eyes off of the thing in the sky. when we did look back toward the sky the thing was still now and then as it did before it got real bright and then it took off in one direction faster than anything I've seen before. so our attention when back to the red thing we thought was still there. it was not. about that time we heard what sounded like a boulder rolling down the hear hill (which was tree covered) so that was when we decided to get out of there.

Sat. Oct 2nd. 3:23 - 3:30 pm. St. Louis, MO. Object hoovering in the sky with flashing light.;2004-10-02 15:30:00;5-10 minutes;Sat. Oct 2nd. 3:23 - 3:30 pm. St. Louis, MO. Object hoovering in the sky with flashing light. I was walking the dogs with my lady friend when I just by chance glaced up into a clear blue sky when I noticed an object flying from what I would say was the North heading roughly south-southwest. I noticed it due to the massive light source it was putting out. At first I dismissed it as a reflection off a planes hull. I looked up at it again and noticed that the light was still flickering even though it was in motion. I know that when you see a reflection from an aircraft, its really only from that angle. As it continues to move the reflection should change until the craft no longer is at the angle for the light to reflect. As this object continued its path, it was still flickering a very bright light. Originally when I noticed the object, it was to the right of the sun and even after it passed and was now to the left there was still this very bright flashing light. This is the reason why I continued to watch. If it were a reflection from the sun, it would have long since past the point of reflection. Anyway, as I watched the object and since it was so small I would say that is was well above 40,000 feet, but the weird thing was that there was no con trail. I continued to watch it and as I did, it began to slow down. I would say that this object had crossed 2/3's of the sky when it came to a stop!. I could not beleive what I was seeing. My lady friend had seen it moving but continued walking on the trail and didnt see it stop as I had. I tried to find someone who could verify what I was seeing, but the only person around was about 100 yards away and he had his child with him so I didnt want him to think I was some nut. Anyway, I ran with the dog to catch my friend. There was a short distance where I could no longer see the object due to a wooded area. I wanted to catch her so that I would have a witness to the craft stopping in mid air. I caught up to her and had her hurry though the wooded area to the clearing so that we could both see it again and upon arriving at the clearing, I could no longer locate the object. There was still about 1 mile or so of trail that we had to walk and I looked in the sky to rest of the way. I cant help but to think that if I had stayed where I was originally at, I could have seen what happened to the object. I dont know if it just took off on the same course or flew further into the sky or what. I know that this sounds crazy and all, but that is what I saw. This took place at Jefferson Barracks Park in South Saint Louis County. If anyone else has seen anything like this, this past Saturday please respond. thanks for your time. Also when the object was stopped or hoovering or whatever you call it, the light was still flashing in the same manner I first noticed it. this is my first time reporting or even seeing anything that I could not explain away. Please help;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Black floating objects flying over St. Louis, Mo.;2007-06-25 20:30:00;15-20 minutes;Black floating objects flying over St. Louis, Mo. On the evening of Monday, June 25, 2007 I noticed what seem to be floating balloons (4) at first, but then I noticed they were keeping a permanent formation. As they drew nearer I realized they were some sort of aircraft. They were very black in color, no associated noise. They seemed to be floating. They were close, but I could not make out a definite shape, no lights (still daylight out). Their flight pattern was south to north, then back again. In route two of them switched positions. Their was one leader and 3 trialing behind, almost in a triangular formation.  I am an avid sky watcher and always study aircrafts, I can't explain what these were...I am baffled.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Another night, another sighting over St. Louis, Mo.;2007-06-26 22:30:00;10 minutes;Another night, another sighting over St. Louis, Mo. The night after my sighting I spotted a star with a yellow/red/orange glimmer. It was really twinkling, that is why I noticed it. I tried to ignore it, but curiosity got the best of me, so about 15 minutes later I went back outside to see what the star was doing...that is when I noticed the red and white flashing lights that were moving around the sky as if they were planes circling while waiting to land at the airport. The airports are too far away from where I was to have been the case. So I stood and watched while they decided to take a flight pattern to the north from south, as they did the night prior. The red and white lights never stopped and I could see them at least 30-40 miles away. Then they came back, just like the night before, but 2 of them went east while the other one stayed south.  My dog and I were on a walk earlier that evening and all of a sudden she got spooked, like I've never seen her ever do before. She just started walking as fast as she could looking and sniffing for something, but it was an aimless chase. She finally settled down about 5 or so minutes into the chase. When we got home she wouldn't go near the front door and that is her post day in and day out.  Like I said before...I am baffled and would love some answers.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
angel hair   ((MUFON REPORT));2008-06-30 12:00:00;20 minutes;UFO – Angel Hair Sighting Sighting Report submitted for Stella XXXX by John Budrys (FI #22542) 5 June 20  On 2 Apr 20, I, John Budrys, was assigned Stella’s MUFON sighting report #XXXXXX of an event witnessed with her husband in 2008. I completed my FI report on 11 May 20, but continue to stay in touch with Stella. During one of the conversations with Stella about her other life experiences, she related a remarkable event. As Stella said she had trouble working with the MUFON reporting forms, I offered to submit this report for her. Stella thought it occurred during one of her truck driving jobs in about 2004, though she said it might have been in 2005. She suggested records of the train wreck would help pinpoint the date, as these don’t happen that often. Stella and her husband, both professional truck drivers, were in the process of making another delivery in the St. Louis area. They heard from other truckers via their CB radio of a train wreck that had occurred several days earlier, so decided to visit the site that afternoon and have lunch. She that the train wreck was on a ! side road next to Hwy I-44, about 30-40 miles west of St. Louis. She said since they were “bob-tail”, which means they had no trailer attached to their cab, they were easily able to drive on the side road and have a look while they had lunch. Stella guessed it may have been March, as the day was fairly warm, and they had their windows open.  They sat in their cab looking at the two wrecked train boxcars that were still there, and the firetrucks that were spraying water on them. After about ten minutes, Stella said they noticed wispy strands floating down and hanging on the trees, street signs, and from the visor in front of their large truck windshield and side mirrors. Stella said she reached her arm out the window and picked up one of the strands that had fallen on the truck’s mirror. She said it dissolved within one or 2 seconds at most as she touched it, and left no residue. She said she thought it might be “Angel Hair” from a UFO, which she had read about in a Time Life book on UFOs.  Stella said despite having read in the book that angel hair was associated with UFOs, she failed to look up to see if there was anything there. In retrospect, she was sad she hadn’t looked up to see what the source might have been, and also regretted she hadn’t tried to save some in a jar. I asked how much of this angel hair was falling. Was it like a snowfall, or just an occasional strand? Stella said there were only a few strands falling at a time, but it was like a very light snowfall. And that there was quite a bit of it. It hung from the nearby trees, street signs, and their truck. I asked what the strands looked like. She said they were light gray, about the thickness of “Silly String” that kids shoot out of spray cans, and had lumps on them, perhaps a few small lumps per strand. I asked how long each strand was, and she said they were about 12 to 18 inches long, with some shorter strands. Stella said the Time Life book she read talked of skeptics suggesting people rep! orting angel hair were just seeing spider threads. Stella said what she saw was definitely not spider silk, and that it would be “absolutely ridiculous” to try and call it that. She was quite familiar with spider silk from living in country environments. She said if you are walking in the woods and get a strand in your face, you definitely feel it, and then might carry a stick in front of you to prevent another strand from getting in your face. I said yep, that’s exactly how I react. She said when she tried picking up the strand from the side mirror of her truck, she felt nothing, it dissolved immediately, and left no trace in her hand. Totally different from spider silk.  As they watched, the strands on the trees and signs were slowly dissolving away, and she noted, interestingly, that the ones on her windshield were shortening as they dissolved away. Stella said they lasted perhaps a few minutes, and covered a roughly circular area around them about 200 feet across. When I asked, she said that they seemed to be in the center of this circle. Though they found the angel hair interesting, Stella thought it was quite common, so they were actually more interested in viewing the two wrecked train cars and fire truck activity than the angel hair. They left after about a half hour, having finished their lunch, at which point the angle hair was still draped over the trees and signs. Because she thought angel hair was common, and because she had no idea to whom she might report it to, she never did.  I asked Stella if her husband would be willing to speak with me about what he recalled of the event. Unfortunately, he has several serious medical issues including the beginning of dementia, and she said he did not feel like talking, but did say he agreed with everything Stella had said about it. He did recall that the angel hair was disappearing as they drove off. When I asked for more detail on how it was dissolving, Stella said she really wasn’t paying attention to the angel hair as she had to concentrate on helping her husband, who was driving, in maneuvering the large truck. She said it’s always good to have two sets of eyes.  I emailed a copy of my first draft of this event to Stella to review what I wrote and answer a few questions, which she did by email. To clarify a few more questions, I called her on 1 June 20 at 4:40pm. Her husband Paul answered, and said Stella was running a few errands and would be back in a few hours. I did not mean to bother him, knowing he was not doing well, but did take the opportunity to ask his recollection of the event. I found him lucid, and speaking normally, though he did admit he could no longer remember the train wreck. I asked how the angel hair appeared, and he said it was like a light snow all over, but in strings. It was draped over the trees and signs and their truck. He said it did not dissolve immediately unless you touched it. And that it left no residue when you touched it. I asked how long it persisted, and he said it fell for about a half hour! And did not dissolve, but just hung on everything. I asked if it stuck to the windshield, i.e., was it st! icky? Or did it blow off like straw as they took off? Could they see through the windshield, or did they have to turn on their wipers? He said no, they had no trouble seeing through the windshield and they did not have to turn on their wipers, as it wasn’t that heavy, and that it wasn’t sticky but blew right off as they started moving.  So was it like “Silly String”, as Stella described it? He said it was, but not as heavy as Silly String. So did it have lumps like Stella noted? He said it was more like “it had ripples in it”. I asked what they thought it was when they saw it. He said they knew about angel hair, so figured that what it was. They probably should have tried to save some, but didn’t.  He then said he had to go, so I didn’t pester him with more questions. But what he did convey pretty much confirmed what Stella conveyed. And he was able to add a few more very interesting details. The few differences in his recalled details actually adds validity to their recollections, as a perfectly matching story would suggest a coordinated tale. I did not find him confused, but honest and clear in his answers. I did not press to keep him on the line, as I realized he might not be feeling well. I asked him to let Stella know I’ll get back with her. Phonecon ended at 4:47pm. In my last call on 4 June 20 to clarify a few more details, I asked Stella if anything odd had occurred before the angel hair began falling. She said no. Wondering about the firetrucks spraying the boxcars, I asked if these were spraying anything that could have wafted up into filaments, like some sort of flame retardant. She said she didn’t recall any hazardous markings on the boxcars, so could not say what was inside them. But it appeared to her that the firetrucks were just spraying water. She again suggested there should be some way to look up news reports of this train wreck, which would not only establish the date, but also might shed some light on the contents of the boxcars.  I asked how long they were there total. She said about a half hour, as they only had a simple lunch. So if the angel hair started falling about ten minutes after they arrived, that would mean it was falling for about 20 minutes. Stella figured that was about right. She had read the second draft of this write-up I’d sent her, which included her husband’s observations. She disagreed with his recollection that none of it had dissolved when they left. She said if it was hanging free, like from a branch, it seemed not to be dissolving. But if it was laying on something, like the windshield, or when touched, it would dissolve. She confirmed there was no need to turn on their windshield wipers, and that it didn’t leave any residue on the glass. She relayed an incident near an airport where jets were circling right overhead and their truck got some jet fuel on it. She was surprised at how much fuel the jets were dropping. The angel hair, by comparison, left nothing on their truck. S! he also disagreed with her husband’s thick as Silly String estimate, saying it was thinner than Silly String. She did agree with his “ripples” description, saying it looked crinkled. I also asked her to clarify her saying it shrank up as it dissolved. She said it didn’t so much shrink up, as dissolve starting at the end and getting shorter and shorter. The mental picture I got from her description was something like a fuse burning down its length, which she said was fairly correct.  I thanked Stella for all her time, and will be sending her a copy of this final write-up.  Just before I submitted this report for Stella, I happened across an older U-Tube video of a Brian Boldman speaking at a “NUFOC” conference, which I gleaned from the sign behind the podium. He had done extensive research on hundreds of angel hair sightings, going back many centuries. He reported some New York sightings of angel hair have been found to be radioactive, and some have been found to contain Tritium, which is very odd. He has handled some samples with tweezers, and found them to have quite a bit of static electricity. Most descriptions compare it to cotton candy, asbestos fibers, or spider strings. Though most skeptics dismiss it as spider webs, he has found a peak of sightings to be in October, while spiders migrate in spring. He submitted a sample he managed to obtain from a 1999 California sighting to Phyllis Budinger, whom I’ve worked with on other physical evidence cases, and who is very reputable. Mr. Boldman said she had found the samples he submitted conta! ined volatiles like carbon disulfide and 2-methyl 1-propene, unusual for a solid, but which might explain how the angel hair might “sublimate” directly into a gas, bypassing any liquid stage. I found Ms. Budinger’s formal report on these samples she analyzed, posted on “The Black Vault” site. She concluded they were organic in nature, were not spider silk, but were more similar to caterpillar silk. She noted no weight loss or physical degradation even after 4 months. This does not resemble the quickly dissolving material Stella or many others report. I will decline from further entering into this controversy, as it seems much remains to be researched yet on this phenomena. But I do thank Stella for her time and willingness to share her experiences. JB  I have submitted this report to NUFORC as the MUFON website surprisingly does not let me submit this report without numerous detail that is unknown. I am saddened as a long time MUFON FI that MUFON must be rejecting many reports due to the requirements for unknown minor details. This eliminates the vast majority of reports, to the detriment of study of this phenomena. I can see why witnesses do not find the MUFON reporting system user friendly. This is my first experience with trying to submit a sighting report to MUFON, and I am extremely saddened by my experience. Thank God for NUFORC!

Very bright amber, green and red lights in the night sky moving slowly to the west northwest.;2010-05-21 21:55:00;12 minutes;Very bright amber, green and red lights in the night sky moving slowly to the west northwest. My husband and I observed a very bright light to the west in the night sky that looked as if it were 'twinkling'.  I am interested in astronomy and know a little about stars and planets.  This was no star or planet that I know of and seemed unusual because it was so very bright.  It was moving very slowly to the west northwest.  Through binoculars, flashing green, amber and red lights were noted. No shape could be seen as it was dark and only the lights were visible.  There was no sound but that could have been because of distance. It appeared that the lights were changing color, and maybe changing configuration although it was difficult to tell because of the distance. We both watched for a while, then my husband went in the house and I stayed and watched until it disappeared behind the tree line.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

I surveyed for other lights to count aircraft.  All others were blinking.  I returned to the steady light to discern its shape.  It continued moving northwest to southeast.   As it got closer I still could not see a shape other than the shape of the light itself.  It winked out no shape against the background light no sound.  I continued looking for the light, shape and listening for sound.  Nothing.  Other than satellites which cannot be seen with the naked eye over such a large city with it's light pollution I have never seen that happen.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Right after one of the announcers made a comment about the weather being cool or brisk, I saw a light, or something lighted by the stadium lights, enter the camera shot from the top right of the frame and 'fly' on an angle down and to the left. From the camera vantage point it appeared at one point that the object passed very close to the rear of the blimp, but I couldn't determine if the object was in front, or behind the blimp. I had not see any birds or bugs all night and could not identify what it was, or if it had structure on my poor quality hd television.

Large UFO over St. Louis (Creve Coeur).;2014-07-28 17:00:00;1 minute;Large UFO over St. Louis (Creve Coeur).  It was July 28th, 2014.  I was at work at a car dealership in Creve Coeur, Mo. I went to the very top of our 6 story car garage to look for a car.  Out the corner of my eye, I saw a very large craft flying very low & slow traveling north over highway 270 which is less than a mile from the garage I was at.   As I took a double take at this craft, I realized that this was not a airplane i was seeing.  The craft was jet black it seemed only the top was reflective to the sun the sides of the craft was not reflecting from the sun on a bright sunny day which was odd.  The craft was also oddly shaped the center seemed to be flat almost disk like but the front and rear seemed to be rounded.   The craft was completely silent it did not admit any noise I could hear.  I have heard many airplanes fly over that parking garage from much further distances.  This craft I seen was the closest I have ever seen a craft near that garage so it should have been very loud and yet the only noise I could hear was cars on the highway.  This craft looked to be possibly bigger than a 757.   I took screenshots of the video that I took and zoomed In the pictures and some people I showed this to thought it was a Chinook helicopter but there is no way it was in my opinion for the fact a Chinook is very loud and what I was seeing was silent.  I am just looking for answers of what this was it could be military, or could be unknown.. Thanks, ((name deleted));38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

Several orange lights in the shape of a triangle.  Form disappeared quickly in sothern evening sky.;2016-04-02 19:45:00;seconds;Several orange lights in the shape of a triangle.  Form disappeared quickly in southern evening sky. On April 2, 2016, I observed several orange lights in the shape of a triangle form in the evening sky.  The lights were not connected on an object.  This event lasted only seconds.  I was not able to count the orange lights as they appeared to be speeding away toward the southern sky.  The sky was blue without a cloud to be seen.  The stars were not visible yet.  The time of observation was after 7:00pm.  I did not look at a clock. After this experience, I quickly tried to explain this to my husband.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
White lights with a red pulsating strobe in a linear formation over St. Louis, MO.;2017-11-09 04:30:00;1 hour;White lights with a red pulsating strobe in a linear formation over St. Louis, MO. At 0430, I took my dog outside for a walk.  I looked up into the sky and noticed 3 bright white lights in a V shape off to the SE.  From my perspective, I would prognosticate that they were about 2-3 miles away.  At first, it looked only moderately out of the ordinary and no sound was heard.  About 30 seconds later the lights flashed a very bright pulsating red strobe light which last for about 5 seconds.  I did not have my phone, so I ran to my apartment which was only 30 feet from my location at the time.  I grabbed my phone and ran back outside.  Upon return, the lights had traversed a significant distance South (estimate 15-20 miles) and maintained that distance for 1 hour.  I did take pictures and video, however the lights were too far to render any valuable imagery.  I continued to watch the lights hover and no additional strobe lights were observed.  During this time a total of 5 white lights could be seen in a linear pattern and would turn on and o! ff intermittently.  At 0530, the lights dissipated and were no longer visible.  No other individuals in the area were present to my knowledge.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

As we come full circle around the park look up at the clouds and happen to notice an object hovering almost over us in the sky.  It was higher then the trees but under the clouds.  It was as hight as you would exspect a helixopter to be and about the same size of one with out the tail propeler.  It rotated about 45 degrees, then it descended slightly, rotated again i could see heat wave coming form under the back of it and it looked as it had a small blue flame like jet purpoltio.  Coming from it that made it illuminate a light blue.  It moved forward about 29ft the started to elelvate until it vanished in the cloud.  After the cloud had past it was gone, just disappeared.  It made no sound at all;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
I spotted a circular object in the sky far away with white and red blinking lights going from slow speeds to light speed.;2019-10-01 00:00:00;10 minutes;I spotted a circular object in the sky far away with white and red blinking lights going from slow speeds to light speed. It began when I was playing video games, then all of a sudden all of my power went out.  I turned my flashlight on and checked the light switches in the hallway which also didn’t work and before I thought to do anything the power came back on by itself.  As I was trying to turn my Xbox back on I glared out the window and saw something that made me report this.  There was something that almost looked like an oval but taking in that what I saw was extremely high in the air I couldn’t see it all that well.  The only thing that stood out to me were the red and white lights formed in a circle as they were flashing continuously.  I tried to take a video of it but my eyes could only see what my camera couldn’t I put my phone down and looked back up.  When I first saw the “ufo” it was moving pretty slow I thought it was a plane or maybe a helicopter.  Finally, I saw the object increase it’s speed immensely, disappearing out of my line of sight within 12 seconds.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
