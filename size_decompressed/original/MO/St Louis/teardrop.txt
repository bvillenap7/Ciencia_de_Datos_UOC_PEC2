&quotCat paw&quot UFO encounter on WI44 in St. Louis, Mo.;1999-11-05 21:00:00;3 minutes;&quotCat paw&quot UFO encounter on WI44 in St. Louis, Mo. I was driving West on I44, around 9 pm, towards Eureka, Mo.  It was dark.  A green light came from behind me.  I watched it in my rear view mirror.  I was in the left lane.  It came down and traveled alongside my car - same speed for approx. 1 mile. I looked over at it.  There were no windows.  Cat paw shape.  Green effervescent color.  A little smaller than the car I was driving.  It seemed as though it could see me looking at it, I felt it was looking at me.  At that point it shot up into the sky, there was a white flash, and it was gone. The entire incident lasted 3 minutes. The prior morning , I had been driving East on I44, and I saw what seemed like erratic flares over the highway not far from my sighting.  Probably 4-5 of them.  One of them went over the highway and seemed to have landed in the Soccer field on left side of highway.  At the time I didn't pay close attention, but believe they were related.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Orange Glow Thing.....;2014-06-16 22:00:00;2 minutes;Orange Glow Thing..... Here is a report as seen by my neighbor who lives directly in back of my house.   Posted at the bottom of this report are two other reports that occurred in September of last year and then in May of this year.  Both have been reported on your site and witnessed by me. ----- Original Message -----  From: Neighbor To:  Me  Sent: Monday, June 16, 2014. 10:27 PM  Subject: Orange Glow Thing  I just saw the orange in the sky. Not perfectly round but shaped like a hot air balloon.  Also seemed to have flame at one end like a balloon. It wasn't too high up in the air like a plane but it went over your house from south to north.  It was moving pretty fast.  By the time i went in to get binoculars by back door I couldn't find it but there are a lot of trees in the way. What is it? It's a real object. I think it's a balloon of some sort.  Went overhead about 10:15 tonite.  I don't think it was high enough for a weather balloon.  It was moving fast and straight like it was being controlled and had power of its own. If you find out or have any ideas let me know.  …..MY RESPONSE TO THE E-MAIL….. Thank you sooo much for this.  Finally someone else has seen it.  Since you are right in back of me, it should always be visible to you as well.  No matter what time of the night, if you see it again, PLEASE call me.  Again, thank you.
