Saw hourglass shape object travel at a great speed across horizon going east to west. object covered distance in about 3 or 4 seconds.;1998-06-06 23:15:00;2-4 seconds;Saw hourglass shape object travel at a great speed across horizon going east to west. object covered distance in about 3 or 4 seconds. I have a job which I work both inside and outside.I observed a electric blue in color hourglass shaped object traveling at agreat speed. This object went in a straight non wavering line across the sky from the eastren horizon to the westren horizon in about 3 or 4 seconds. I work by the airport and know an aircraft cant travel that much distance so fast. This object was silent and only emited the blue light which conformed with its shape. I told my friends what I saw and they thought I was nuts.I came across your web site tonight and thought I would convey what I saw. It may help or it may not,but that is what I saw.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721

We live in suburban south St. Louis and have seen FA-18s fly over in the past this object was travelling about half as fast as they normally do. The object seemed to have a halo around it at times.

St. Louis County Sky Object;2009-01-29 20:50:00;2 minutes;St. Louis County Sky Object Just wondering whether anyone else in St. Louis County noticed an unusually bright object in the low western sky about 8:50 p.m., January 29, 09.  Object appeared cube shaped, very bright, motionless for about a minute and then disappeared to the west.  Color seemed a bit on the orange side.  Since we watch birds at our bird feeder, I grabbed the binoculars and was able to make out the unusual shape to this thing. By the way, I'm not believer in this kind of stuff, but have been a little troubled since seeing this.  Hopefully someone else saw this too and can offer an explanation.

UFO hovers and vanished outside of baby's window.;2011-10-08 01:09:00;two minutes;UFO hovers and vanished outside of baby's window. Saw a bright white light in the shape of a diamond with light blue lights across it hovering slowly up and down outside of my daughters window.   It came very close to the ground and back up high very slowly numerous times and even at one time stopped moving completely.  I called for my husband and only moments after he saw it, the UFO flew towards our house overhead and vanished.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
Diamond Shaped Object with Three Distinct Circles over Saint Louis, MO during Geminid Meteor Shower;2012-12-14 02:35:00;45 seconds;Diamond Shaped Object with Three Distinct Circles over Saint Louis, MO during Geminid Meteor Shower Six of my friends, and myself stayed up late to watch the Geminid Meteor Shower.  Three of them are in my Masters program in Athletic Training at Saint Louis University  Two were my neighbors, and one was my fiance.   Four of us, me and my 3 classmates, were laying on the concrete saw the object flying North to South.  I pointed to it the same time a second person next to me saw the object.  Two others on the concrete saw it as well, making it four observers, including myself (all in my Masters program).  It had no lights.  It did, however, have 3 visible circles in a triangular pattern, and a faint fourth circle in the back, making a diamond shape.  The circles looked like, what I would describe, a suction cup.  They were dark on the edges, become lighter towards the center, and were darkest in the center.  It gave the appearance like these circles, we were seeing were cone-like, and we were seeing them from below the cone, from wide end to the tip. What could be seen on the object was only due to the reflection of the city.  It was flying at a medium speed at a lower level from North to South.  It left no trail behind the object.  There was also no sound. We had it in view for about 45 seconds.  I'm assuming it was a lower level because of the reflection of the city lights off its exterior.  What I found most intriguing was that there were no lights on the object as a plane would have on its wings.  There were no red or white lights. The only colors we could make out were shades of gray.  There was only one object.   We tried to get the other three people with us to see the objects, so we stood up, and pointed at it.  However, we lost it in the street lights as our eyes adjusted to the lights.  As we went upstairs, I drew a picture of the object and asked the others if it was what they saw.  All three observers exclaimed, YES! That's EXACTLY it!  We did not feel threatened by it. It is important to note that each of us had had two drinks each, but were under the legal limit to drive safely.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
4 large Diamond shaped Ufo's with flame in front corner  moving fast south to north on still night. video;2014-08-23 22:45:00;10 minutes;4 large Diamond shaped Ufo's with flame in front corner moving fast south to north on still night.  Video. Saw 4 large very bright Ufo's cross the sky form south to north. one would go horizon to horizon then the next would come. So I stepped outside around 10:45 and noticed a very large bright halo coming towards me.   It came straight overhead and was probably 2x the size of the moon at that point, (clear hot humid night with no moon) no sound! so i was looking up trying to take this thing in. it was a defined diamond shape,yellow orange, with a burning/flickering  flame, white, in the forward corner of the diamond.   The diamond shape around the flame seemed to jump and dance around leading me to believe it was not a solid thing, rather a diamond shaped halo. Tthese things moved fast... horizon to horizon in about 3 min. no sound, no change of direction.   I looked straight up at this thing which almost looked like a hot-air balloon in the jet stream...but there was no basket... looking straight up could still see the flame and diamond halo. very crazy experience.  Here's the video  http://youtu.be/w-l3_SWCm2U;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
The rapid blinking and bright color of the object.;2015-03-27 23:30:00;2 minutes;The rapid blinking and bright color of the object. On Friday night March 27 2015, around 11:30 p.m. I spotted a unidentified object in the sky.  It was shaped like a star.  I would say the color of this object was a red orange.  It was the rapid blinking that was so impressive.   No more than 2 minutes was it appearing in the west sky in the city of St. Louis, MO before vanishing into the sky.   As I was engaged in what I was seeing, it appeared to stay in the same location.  Not being able to share this experience with a neighbor was unfortunate.  I knew time would not allow me go and get someone and I was right.;38.6118893412823;-90.3139591735721
