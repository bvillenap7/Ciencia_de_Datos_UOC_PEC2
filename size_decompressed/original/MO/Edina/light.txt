Night time under-lit V formation;2020-02-22 23:15:00;10-15 seconds;Night time under-lit V formation Initial thought I was seeing geese flying in formation and under lit..so out of context. Realized there was no wing movement and it was a dark night.  It was in a haze but looking directly overhead the stars were bright and clear.  The object was moving slowly as in neutral in a WNW direction.  The altitude Iâ€™m guessing was around 1,000 ft.  After observing the object for 10-15 seconds, the lights suddenly went out and nothing could be seen.;40.1821;-92.1437
