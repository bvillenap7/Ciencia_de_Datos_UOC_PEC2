Blurry UFO.;2014-09-20 23:45:00;2 1/2;Blurry UFO Smoking on my back porch, looking up at the stars..  It was so clear no clouds in the sky...  Off to the right of my house I seen a blur and I looked away for a moment.  I turned to look back to my right and it was moving closer to my house it was passing over a field where the cows are at..  It still was moving closer and as I'm watching it ..... It went over my head about 30 40 feet above me..  I could see it so clearly ..  It looked like little tiny stars with fog or clouds that was in a triangle shape flying in formation..   U can kinda see thought the blur no headlights no sound no color to it no blinking lights..  It was about the size of a hand-glider or a little bigger..   It went over my head and off into the distance..   I went back in side the house to tell my boyfriend to come outside and about an half an hour later it cam back this time flying to the left of my house and floated off.  It came around several times and left after a while I didn't feel safe an! ymore and went into the house...  What ever I saw it was unbelievable and scary.  Thanks for listening maybe it can be explain.  Not sure how but that's for reading my story.;39.3928999999999;-94.5547000000002
