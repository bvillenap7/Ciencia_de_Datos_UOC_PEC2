The first one was very close to the ground and about one city away. It was a bright golden in color light that was making quick movements in a (w) or (V V) formation, then took off in a blink of an eye into the Southwest direction. The remaining lights were very much higher in the sky and were the color of stars, only much brighter. They too were moving in (W)or (V V) formations. We did not stay any longer than that. We had had enough by that point. Even though the sun was soon to come up and many bass would be jumping, we were no longer interested in making it through the night.
