Unidentified Flying Objects we could not confirm was of US origin.

The 7 of us adults had witnessed lights following commercial airliners in the sky.  They got bright and dimmed immediately and followed the airliners then disapeared.  We could confirm it was NOT falling stars and it could not have been satellites.  The 7 of us just couldn't believe what we were seeing.  The lights were traveling much faster than a regular commercial jet would travel.  The first thought I had was it could have been military jet fighters but that was ruled out as we had a recent vet of the Us Military confirm they were not fighter jets.;39.3928999999999;-94.5547000000002
3 hovering lights over small town.;2012-11-12 22:00:00;30 minutes;3 hovering lights over small town The 3 lights were hovering around radio antennas off the highway.  They would come together then split back apart.  One got closer to my house and looked more triangular and made absolutely no noise.  Another flew right over the town of Smithville about a quarter mile off the ground.  These lights didnt blink like planes, as well as they didn't make noise at all.;39.3928999999999;-94.5547000000002
Multiple star-like objects triangle formation moving in zig zags, quick up/down, left/right & half circle movements - Smithville, MO;2019-06-19 23:00:00;>1 hour;Multiple star-like objects triangle formation moving in zig zags, quick up/down, left/right & half circle movements - Smithville, MO I initally saw what looked like a star in the sky.  I then noticed that it moved quickly up, down, to the right, then make half circles then zig zag quickly to the right, yet staying in a general area.  I called my 19 year old son to look and he saw it too.  I called the local police and 2 seasoned Smithville, Missouri, police officers came over and they saw the same light moving and then they saw multiple lights moving.  The lights looked like stars in the sky.  Three lights were in the formation of a large triangle.  There was another brighter light to the right of that triangle that was moving as well.  They were in the sky for some time, like 2 hours that I watched them.  The more I watched the sky, the more movement I saw of bright star-like objects moving.  They were not planes as planes cannot move quickly like that.  I do not drink or do drugs of any kind.  I am a Licensed Professional Counselor.
