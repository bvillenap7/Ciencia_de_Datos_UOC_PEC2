Stationary bright light drops to the ground.  ((anonymous report));2016-12-12 06:20:00;10 seconds;Stationary bright light drops to the ground. I was driving east on I 435 near Smithville, MO, at about 6:20 am (it was still pitch black), when I saw a very bright circle white light off in the distance (above Liberty, MO area).  The light stayed stationary for about 6 seconds and then went straight down toward the ground, from my view it went behind the tree line and disappeared.
