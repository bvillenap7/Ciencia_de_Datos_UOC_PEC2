At first there were 4, lights in a straight line, then the lights made an almost rectangular shape.  The only difference between the shape i seen and a rectangle was that if you picture a rectangle and the bottom 2, angles were further apart than the top 2.   Shortly after the lights completely vanished.;37.6807;-92.6583000000001
