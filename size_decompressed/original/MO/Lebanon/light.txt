Strange lights in South Central Missouri Night Sky;2009-11-09 18:20:00;<1 minute;Strange lights in South Central Missouri Night Sky We live in a rural part of Missouri about 30 miles southeast of Fort Leonard Wood, so I don’t know if these incidents are related to the base????  Last night was the 2nd or 3rd time my 13 year old has seen these lights in the night sky, but my first full experience. We were driving home and the lights just appeared (there were other planes flying in the area and these were not the same kind of lights).  They had a sort of yellowish glow and there were 3 at first in a triangular shape all the same brightness and then they just faded out, next they lit up one at a time but in 3 different spots and then just faded away. After that, the lights took the shape of a half moon and lit up one right after the other in rapid succession from top to bottom then bottom to top (sort of like a tail of a huge firework, there were none in the area).  After the half moon shape, they lit up straight up and down lighting up in rapid succession again and then fading out, followed by the lights lighting up in 3 different spots again shaped sort of like a triangle and then fading out. We weren’t close enough to see anything other than the lights, but my 13  year old has seen this same thing before above the field in the back of our home???;37.6807;-92.6583000000001
String of ~12 lights hovering in straight line above hwy 44 in w/unusual light patterns. ((NUFORC Note:  Law enforcement report.  PD));2017-12-09 20:30:00;20-25 minutes;String of 12 or more lights hovering in a straight line above highway 44 in Missouri with unusual light patterns Driving toward Saint Louis on highway 44, near Lebanon, we saw a string of lights for about 20 minutes that had a very unusual flash sequence.  They seemed to be hovering over the highway.   At first we thought they were a fixed object such as a string of towers of some sort.  As we got closer, we realized that they were much to high (maybe a mile or so, hard to say for certain as we were in a vehicle the entire time.)  They were in mostly a straight line but not exactly and flashing red and white in a very odd pattern.  As we got closer, they headed West, not sure of the speed.   Someone on our bus was able to record it through the windows.   About 20 people saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report is a member of law enforcement.  PD));37.6807;-92.6583000000001
