Several Orange Globe Fireball Lights Low in the Sky, Winking Out and Coming Back In Other Locations.;2016-02-22 19:00:00;90 minutes;Several Orange Globe Fireball Lights Low in the Sky, Winking Out and Coming Back In Other Locations. My teenage son roams our 2 acre property every evening, looking at stars and playing with our cats.   He came in to get me a few minutes before 7 and told me he saw some strange orange globe lights in the sky and that he didn't know what they were.   I immediately went out, looked in the northwest sky, just over the horizon and I saw an orange globe fireball light that suddenly split apart and was 3 globes, but they were very very close together and I couldn't tell if it was one or three.  My son said the same.  He couldn't tell if it was four or one.  They stayed in the sky for 15 seconds or so, and then just went out.   Over the next hour and a half the lights came back, all in similar areas, but not exactly the same place.  Sometimes the globes were further apart, other times, closer.  They were in a straight line.  I went inside for a while and my son said they were arranged in a triangle shape at times.   I came back out and saw them one more time.  My son caught a 3 second video, but his battery went dead.  There was no sound at all.   My son said they looked to be about 3 miles away.  I could not tell.  The dogs in the neighborhoos were going crazy barking.  Our two cats were acting very odd. I am not sure if this is significant enough to warrant being contacted by an investigator, but you may contact me if desired.;37.6807;-92.6583000000001
