UFO Over Lebanon, MO;2012-05-26 04:49:00;2:00;UFO Over Lebanon, MO http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qIvLlspMSY   This video was taken in Lebanon, MO on 5/26/12 at 4:49am using generation 3 pvs-7 night vision goggles recording onto a Sony Cybershot camera. I immediately discounted it as a plane since it was flashing, but then as it got closer I noticed it had 3 lights and then as it got even closer it actually had 4 lights. This craft appeared silently in the sky over Lebanon, MO, approximately 3-4 miles in the air at 146 deg SE, traveling NW at 320 deg unknown rate of speed. Appears to be some sort of craft that may be mimicking an airplane since it has flashing lights.  You can clearly see 4 bright lights (maybe engines) that are connected by some sort of dense frame structure.   Also appears to connect through the middle of the craft from the front light to the back light. After altering the contrast etc I was able to determined from the video that the tail light flashes, then the left light followed by the nose light.  It does not appear that the right light flashes at all. Once it passed over me the goggles became too saturated with the light and washed out the object and prevented me from getting a sharp image.;37.6807;-92.6583000000001
