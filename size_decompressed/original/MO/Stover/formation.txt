I live just south of Stover, MO, in the woods, in a 2nd story building.  I saw numerous orbs of orange lights appearing and disappearing to the S-SE of my home.   I went out on my deck to attempt to film them, but the trees got in my way, and the camera wouldn't focus is such dull light.  A lot of aircraft traffic starting immediately after the first orange orb appeared. High altitude jets circled back and forth for at least the last ten minutes.  At one point, the clouds above the horizon where the orbs appeared and disappeared lit up a few times, as if the orbs were in the clouds.  I have no idea what to think.  While it was happening, the entire forest seemed to start calling.  Coyotes and owls, birds that are usually silent at this late evening hour.  They all suddenly stopped after the last orb seemed to just disappear.   I came inside because I got cold, and my camera battery seemed to suddenly drain.  It is now 7:38pm and there are still jets canvassing back and forth.  I've witnessed several USAF exercises, and none of them involved orange orbs.  This doesn't seem like night training/drills to me and those were definitely not flares or blank incendiary devices - I've saw those before.  These orbs look nothing like the blanks or flares.;38.4411;-92.9998
