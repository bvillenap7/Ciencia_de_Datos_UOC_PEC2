My eyes were wandering around while i was talking and when i looked up at the sky I observed a strange row of lights . There were larger white lights which were moving in a circular motion around from my view what appeared to be a shady disk shape . With smaller orange colored lights on the bottom , I viewed this object hovering in the sky for about 25 seconds . when i decided to go get my camcorder . I ran in the house and grabbed my video recorder and attached my battery . When i got back outside the object was no longer sitting still but it had moved far east in a matter of seconds . I could still see the faint lights in the distance , but was unable to zoom in the object in time before it was gone . Im a regular sky observer , and i watch air craft all the time i live not to far from whiteman air force base , I see them practice on a regular basis . But ive never seen anything like this , The object was also silent;38.4411;-92.9998
