I bent down to pick it up and I noticed a bright orangish white light streaking across to sky . So I ran as fast as I could inside and grabbed my camcorder . When I got back outside I was able to record the object for a few seconds until it vanished into a near by cloud . I then turned my camera off because my battery was low , then I turned and headed back towards the house when i noticed another object directly over head . I quickly turned my camcorder back on and was able to get this object for about 20 to 25 seconds until it to vanished into some clouds . The second object had 2 bright lights attached to unknown dark craft . Also the first object was far away , but the second was close enough to see it was not a airplane or jet .;38.4411;-92.9998
