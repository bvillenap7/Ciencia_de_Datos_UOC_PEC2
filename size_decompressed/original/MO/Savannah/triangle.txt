Triangle over heartland.;2013-11-11 05:00:00;4 seconds;TRIANGLE OVER HEARTLAND I just got home and as I do I was setting in driveway with the moon roof open in my car.  I was looking up, it was half cloud cover, half sky and stars.  I was facing South when out of the corner of my eye to my right (west) I caught something moving fast.  At first I thought it was a bird.  Like when it's dark and u see a bird above, black on black makes it hard to see.  But then I seen a row of lights, that's the only thing that made me keep flowing this accross the sky.  It was NOT a bird.  It was almost as if the lights were bairly on.  They was very dim, but enough that it wasn't black in black. (meaning black sky behind black object.  It took about 4 seconds to cover entire sky from West to East.  It was very low, under clouds, and very fast and silent.  Not a sound. Now this next part take it for what it's worth.  I'm in a bad spot in my life rite  now.  With bills,  No job, injury, ect.  I was looking up in the sky asking God, mother earth and the Universe to help me.  I've been reading law of attraction lately, the book called the secret.  In it they say the universe is alive, mother earth is alive.  So I was talking to them.  I guess praying to them.  I asked for them to show me something, anything.  Give me something to believe in.  Show me your real.  And then I seem to. Quinidine?  Possibly.  And no I wasn't soo needing to see something my brain made it up.  I was hoping for like a shooting star or something like that.  Instead I got this.  Freaking awesome!!;39.9168;-94.8267
