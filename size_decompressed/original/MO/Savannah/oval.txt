Light in the sky;2012-06-16 10:30:00;:45;Light in the sky Very high altitude moving fast then, pausing for 5 to 6 min. at a time.  When moving there was a teardrop trail behind. the object seemed to move side to side when not traveling.  I watched for 15 min with binoculars, the object traveled farther away, continuing a north to south,slow weaving motion while continuing west.   This was not an aircraft. the object was at an altitude that I could only assume was in orbit or further. white light and weaving across the eastern sky at about as high as one might look up. sorry for lack of description but, what I just viewed tonight was not of mankind.this scared me to death.
