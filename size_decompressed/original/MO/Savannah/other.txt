Three lights (think part of another bigger object) zoomed across sky.;2014-02-22 05:35:00;5 seconds;Three lights (think part of another bigger object) zoomed across sky Using my Binos doing an early morning sky watch and Right in front of me I seen a line if 3 lights (running from and starting in the 2 o'clock position and ending at the 7 o'clock position) imagine a line drawn from the 2 to the 7 on a clock.  There was way too low to be satellites ir shooting stars.  It looked like it was a part of a bigger object.  Moving very low, very fast and very silent.  By the time I turned my astrological binoculars toward it I couldn't find it.  It was gone.  Activity really picking up around this location as of late.
