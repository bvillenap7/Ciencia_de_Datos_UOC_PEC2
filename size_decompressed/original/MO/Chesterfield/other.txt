((HOAX??))  v shaped craft spotted with no lights, at night, and along busy highway.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2008-02-27 19:00:00;10 seconds;v shaped craft spotted with no lights, at night, and along busy highway I was driving home on busy 40 highway in St.louis,Mo. I started thinking about aliens for some reason. I looked out my car window at the stars. I thought I saw a black outline of a V.  I rolled down my window to see if it was really there.  It was.  The craft had no lights but it was metal because it slightly reflected the city lights. It was flying very low and slowly. It was flying backward like >. It was about the size of a 747. The stars behind it disappeared and reappeared when it went by. I know it was there even though it was really hard to see.  I just happened to look up at the right time. It was spooky feeling. It was like they wanted me to see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax.  Student report.  PD));38.6380322641509;-90.5732637735851
