None of the lights flashed nor moved. These were seen in the NE sky for as long as I was outdoors (approximately 15 minutes in the car and then looking out the bathroom window at home).  After dropping my husband off at the YMCA, I pointed this object in the sky to him, thinking it was the morning star.  But after driving away, I observed it more carefully and that is what I saw.  Interestingly, I did take a picture with my iPhone after parking the car and after enlarging it, I see it to be cigar-shaped.  The green light doesnâ€™t show up in the picture because of tree foliage.  I will attempt to send the photo to the link below. I do not believe in UFOs, but I do believe in angels working for God and demons working for Satan.  Please contact me only if you find this useful.;38.6380322641509;-90.5732637735851
