I was logged-on my computer, and I started hearing this low humm, like a motor without a fan belt.  I looked out my window, and I see about 3 UFO in a diamond formation, hovering.  And I look at the street lights, and they start dimming low and would light back up at about 3 second intervals.;38.6380322641509;-90.5732637735851

Extremely large flash of white light midnight April 5th, 2009 Unknown arial phenomena. Large white flash lit up the sky, bright enough to block out the stars, and reflected off neighbors houses. Bright white flash of light to big to be a meteor, and no sound, too large to be a commercial fire work, literally thought an explosion was going to occur from something as big as a chemical plant. Occurred from west over or past Chesterfield, Missouri.  Flash appeared for only 2-3 seconds. Flash originated from west to east completely  blanketing sky lighting up 1/4 of Northwestern sky.
