Above us, a bright bluish globe of light brightened the sky just after dusk.  It rose in intensity, then diminished to nothing, in about two seconds.  The observers were both electrical engineers who were watching a distant fireworks display on July 4th.  Neither observer had previously experienced such phenomena.;38.6380322641509;-90.5732637735851
Bright-light object ascended rapidly through clouds which were about 5,000 ft up;2005-10-26 19:30:00;10 sec;Bright-light object ascended rapidly through clouds which were about 5,000 ft up After crossing the bridge on US 40/61 toward O'fallon, MO, we observed a bright light over the missouri river which at first appeared to be aircraft as there is an airport (spirit of St. Louis) in the vicinity.   It appeared to hover a couple seconds, after which a spot type lamp illuminated the clouds above it at which time it ascended very rapidly straight up through them and disappeared.   We also observed some vehicles pulled off the highway which may have witnessed the same occurrence.   The light was bright white, very similar to aircraft landing lights.;38.6380322641509;-90.5732637735851
Three lights in triangular formation too far apart to be any conventional aircraft.;2014-03-05 20:13:00;5 minutes;Three lights in triangular formation too far apart to be any conventional aircraft. Was walking my dog on Squires Way Drive in Chesterfield.  I noticed a group of three lights in a triangular formation.  The lights were too far apart to be a single craft--my guess would be they were about the length of three widebody airplanes apart. The lights stayed in formation for a few minutes, then changed to a perfectly horizontal line.  They then returned to the triangular formation and stayed there for several more minutes before the left light disappeared. The remaining two lights stayed in a linear formation for another 30 seconds or so before the right light also disappeared.  The center light still remained as I turned to leave the scene. I did see some conventional aircraft heading toward the lights immediately after they disappeared. I attempted to video the phenomenon, but street lights in the area were too bright to capture any worthwhile video.;38.6380322641509;-90.5732637735851
Strange lights at base of thunderstorm.;2016-07-10 20:22:00;10 seconds;Strange lights at base of thunderstorm. We were observing a thunderstorm to the north of our location in Chesterfield when we observed what I thought was an aircraft taking off from Lambert break out of the bottom of the cloud moving to the west.  The craft had a number of strobing lights (white, green, red) which I assumed was an aircraft however from the changing dimensions and orientation of the light and the erratic movement (tumbling and rolling)  I ruled out an aircraft. My next thought was a collection of balloons however the intensity of the strobing lights and flashing colors makes me think it was not.  It was also too large to be a drone.  The lights were visible for a few second and then moved off to the west and out of view.  I managed to capture one image with phone camera.;38.6380322641509;-90.5732637735851
