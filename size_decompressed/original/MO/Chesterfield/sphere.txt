I was driving in my car getin all fucked up because it was my birthday well only a little bit, when over the cornfield to the left a grate ball of smoke rushed threw the field and over the road. I did not see the first one clearly, I thought is was car lights, but my friend told me what he saw, I thought he was crazy. A few minuts later on the same road I saw the bright ball of gas going from the midle of the road up and over the trees and vanished.;38.6380322641509;-90.5732637735851
