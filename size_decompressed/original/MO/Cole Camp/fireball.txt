It was decending at a shallow angle and travelling strangely slow.  The object had a trail and to my recollection it was greenish blue. My wife and I were traveling southbound on US 65 highway that evening, returning from Sedalia to our home in Cole Camp.  The sight of this object made us quickly forget about what we had been discussing and take interest in this object.  When sighted we were near the intersection of US 65 and westbound MO 50.  After the object dissapeared out of sight to the southeast we proceeded southbound.  We traveled as far south as Lincoln while keeping our eyes fixed low on the sky to the south.  No other sighting was made. I had discussed the sighting with my father a few days later to find out of he had witnessed anything similar that evening.  He had not.  I have not reported this sighting until now as I have just discovered this website and decided to specifically search for other accounts of this event. The above time is approximate - I will attempt to reconcile my time that evening against other records and clarify it further in the near future.;38.473375;-93.197825
