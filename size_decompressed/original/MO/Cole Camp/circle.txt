Small black circle object then turned red, orange and then a bright white.  ((NUFORC Note:  Looks like a contrail??  PD));2017-11-08 17:30:00;20 minutes;Small black circle object then turned red, orange and then a bright white. Around 5:30pm, November 8, 2017, driving south on 65 highway i seen something in the sky to my right, which is west in the area of Whiteman Air Force Base.  At first it looked like a black small object.  As i kept staring at it started to change colors, from black to a bright orange, red, and then bright white.  It was about the size of a pea in the sky is how i can describe it.  My son was driving and was seeing this too.   We pulled off 65 highway and i grabbed my cell phone and started taking pictures and video.  Then came fighter jets keeping distances, but circling this unidentified object in the sky. I called Whiteman Air Force Base Security and reported this.  The officer took my name and phone number, and said he would be having someone check it out. 30 minutes after this call, there where 3 jet in a row flew over my home in the direction of unusual red, green, and yellow spinning lights.  i could see it in the tree line not the sky, which i disagree with it being a twinkling star.  I hope these photos you can see what i saw.  you will have to zoom in a little.     Sincerely yours,  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  The two tiny white specks in the photos the witness has forwarded look to us to be short contrails behind high-altitude aircraft.
