Bright light hovering in the sky which then quickly moved in a horizontal direction.;1999-11-10 18:10:00;1 minute;Bright light hovering in the sky which then quickly moved in a horizontal direction. I am a degreed computer professional who has tried to escape the city life rat race by living in a rural area just outside of St. Louis. The event happened around 6:10 p.m. on 11/10/99. I was driving in a valley between two ridge tops in a heavily wooded area (Hillsboro-House Springs Road). This area has no streets lights of any kind and there is farmland in the valley between the two ridge tops. On my left there was a break in the ridge, and a light (almost moon size) was hovering stationary to the left of the break. I rolled down the window and stopped the car on the road. There was no audible sound coming from the light. Shortly thereafter, a car was coming up behind me so I proceeded forward. The light moved at a very quick speed horizontally to the right (about 15-20 degrees). I lost sight of it after that due to trees obstructing my view. The total event time of the sight of the light was about 1 minute. The only other sighting I have had was in 1976(?). This involved several traveling red glowing objects, observed while going down the Mississippi River on the ship the Admiral. I was not the only person on board that saw them. ship the Admiral;38.4061615384615;-90.5689692307692
Two very bright white flashing / flickering orbs turning solid at times.;2014-05-27 23:00:00;1 minute;Two very bright white flashing / flickering orbs turning solid at times. My 10 year old son observed lights from our living room window (around 11:30 pm) in the sky south of our home.  He called out to me and said “Dad, something is flying around outside and I don’t think it’s an airplane, it’s kind of freaking me out”.  My wife and I made it outside in time to watch about 30-45 seconds of two (think welding arc) intensely bright white lights flashing and flickering then turning solid and back again before disappearing behind the ridge line.  They were at slightly different altitudes and to far apart to be two lights of the same craft, but moving in unison.  They had no distinguishable shape, and no sound. Altitude was 500–1000 feet.  Speed fluctuated from something faster than a typical light aircraft to perhaps slower than stall speed for a light fixed wing aircraft.  Direction was roughly west to east and a mile +/- from our location.  After losing sight of the objects we hopped in the car and drove to see if we could follow but ultimately found nothing. This is the third UFO sighting we have had in 9 years of living in this area and the first we have reported.;38.4061615384615;-90.5689692307692
