Five bright orange-red bright lights were seen coming from the north of my house, moving south,  There were two in front of the others and they were flying in the shape of an inverted Y formation.  They just seemed to disappear after a few minutes. There was no sound whatsoever.  If we hadnt been standing on our deck we would have never known. Our TV did go black screen at the same time but when we came back in we were able to turn it back on. By the time we thought of getting our phones to take a pic it was gone. We were all trying to figure out what we were seeing.;38.4061615384615;-90.5689692307692

Seemed not far away as we continued on our way to work (20 miles away) we kept seeing it but it was getting farther and farther away.    We got to work 20 miles later and could still see the object but was definitely higher up in the sky and getting farther and farther away.  Was a solid bright light, no blinking, only 1 color and very bright. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
