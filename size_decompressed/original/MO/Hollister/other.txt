Hollister MO  boomerang  2 to 3 seconds boomerang object flew right over me. about 5 am;2008-05-15 05:00:00;2 seconds;Hollister MO  boomerang  2 to 3 seconds boomerang object flew right over me. about 5 am Im sure alot of the videos ect we see on tv and internet might be real. However if they are. What I seen doesnt match. I seen what I saw one time on a video on here somewhere, I dont remeber where. I went out in the am to have my morning cigerette. I always look up at the stars ect when im out smoking in the am, Theres alot of shooting stars ect... I was looking up to the sky, when a boomerang object flew right over the top of me. I have no idea what it was, but it was clear as day. It made no sound at all, It had no Lights that i could see on the bottom side of it. It almost looked kind of transperent, to a mirror chrome like object. It looked like it could have been man made, but it would be very hard,, the edges were so clean. Also the there was no sound and it moved so effortlessly. Im not a liar and i have no reason to lie. I saw what I saw, and yes it was a litgtle strange. I still think about it everyday. If i seen it again or a picture of it, I could easily identify it. Thank You, ((nme deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));36.6127;-93.2336
