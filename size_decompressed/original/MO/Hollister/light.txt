V-Shaped formation, hovering for 45 minutes to 1 hours, red and white flashing lights;2012-08-19 09:30:00;1 hour;V-Shaped formation, hovering for 45 minutes to 1 hours, red and white flashing lights Husband called me out to say something weird is in the sky, they were changing colors from red to white, like it was stationary moving in a circle, the first 3 we spotted hovered over the sky in a v shape or triangle form, then we spotted 3 more in the same v shape formation hovering for over 45 minutes to 1 hour, finally one of the ufo just shot off, leaving the others to still hover.  Don't know if this has anything to do with it, but saw a shooting star go in between them.   My cousin ((name deleted)) - senior retired, my husband - 46 works for UPS, my Mom 87 and my Dad 92 all saw these ufos.  Also ((deleted)) boyfriend ((deleted)) - a retired steel working also saw and witnessed these object, I work the for the US Coast Guard and I am XX.  In all my life have never witnessed anything like this, was really strange.;36.6127;-93.2336
