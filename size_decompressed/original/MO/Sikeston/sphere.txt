earth bound from south to north.;1998-12-13 23:20:00;10 sec.;earth bound from south to north. We were driving north to our home in Cape Girardeau from Sikeston Mo on US highway 61.  In our peripheral vision we saw a spherical shape of white light flash down from the sky.  Then the we watched as the sphere landed some distance away, beyond a treeline, presumeably in a field.  The Ball of light was traveling North.  The light appeared to have landed 3 to 4 miles away, but due to the treeline, we could not see it actually land.  It looked much brighter than a meteor.  In fact it was the brightest thing in the sky. ((NUFORC:  Please seen related report from 2nd witness for same event.));36.8902000000002;-89.582600000001
