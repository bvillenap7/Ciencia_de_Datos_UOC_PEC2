Blue lights scanning the sky line;2010-06-30 23:00:00;45 minutes;Blue lights scanning the sky line On June 30, 2010, approximately 11:00pm to 11:45pm central time I witnessed four glowing lights and a partially cloned spacecraft above my neighbors yard, precisely hovering above a dog pin.  Lights where hovering ahead of the craft and ahead of a strange looking cloud, apparently monitor things up ahead.  The lights where circling around  75-100 feet from the ground going southeast in the countryside between the towns of Sikeston and Blodget Missouri.  Four rotating lights going clockwise made a complete revolution, then would come together in the center joining together making a fifth light. Afterwards, the rotating lights moved outwards to make another rotation pattern. This continued patterned  lasted for about 30 minutes. The lights where flat and symmetrical, about 10-15 feet across with no visible source of reference and silenced.   Some times, the rotating pattern got larger and come across our street, and other times it got smaller.  The sky was clea! r from were the lights were dancing around, but behind the lights there were some thin cumulus clouds.  The lights moved with the clouds at a very slow pace, perhaps 1 mph.  The sky was visible through the breaking clouds and at times the stars and the partly full moon was visible.   When the clouds rolled across the highline electrical grid it caused some disturbance and made an object temporary visible though the breaking clouds.  The object that was hiding above (or inside) the clouds was temporary visible until it passed the electrical power lines.    This object was black but it appeared like it was shorting out because there where green flairs sparking around it. The size and shape was not visible on account that it was partially cloned and hidden by the cloud.;36.8902000000002;-89.582600000001
