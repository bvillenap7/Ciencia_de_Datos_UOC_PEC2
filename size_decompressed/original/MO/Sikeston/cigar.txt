Cigar shaped Object in Sikeston;2000-09-13 20:10:00;2 minutes;Cigar shaped Object in Sikeston Tonight, Sep 13, 2000 at aprox. 2010 or so, I was standing out on the back deck with my daughter. I told her to bring her little binoculars out so we could look at the moon, planes or any UFOs. I brought my bigger binoculars out as well. I was talking on the telephone and looking at a plane that caught my eye. Well, I pointed it out to my daughter and as I turned around I happened to look above me. Well lo and behold there was a silent, cigar shaped object gliding along from west to east. It had no wings, was solid as I could see it blotting out the stars that should have been thru it. It had one steady white light (with a slight yellowish cast to it) on either end of it. When I looked thru the binoculars I could also see a dimmer solid red light towards the back about 3/4 of the way. While not viewed with the binoculars, it seemed to have a slight haze arpound it, like perhaps anothe rbrighter light on top that I could not make out from the bottom. It was apparently at a fairly high altitude. When I saw it right over me, it was equal to about 3 to 3 and a hlaf thumb nails wide ( at arms length)   there was no noise that could be heard, although at its percieved altitude, the sound if it had any probably could not have been heard. The plane was headed generally southeast and looked like it was at a lower altitude (note I didnt notice any noise associated with it either.) The plane seemed to not take any notice of the other object whatsoever. My daughter (shes 6 so not the best observer however) and I both saw it as did my sister (40) because I opened the door and shouted to come out quick quick quick! She saw it as two white lights traveling along (the red light was only noticeable with the binocs) My binoculars are Bushnell Ensign Wide Angle. They are 7 x 35 (500 feet at 1000 yards);36.8902000000002;-89.582600000001
