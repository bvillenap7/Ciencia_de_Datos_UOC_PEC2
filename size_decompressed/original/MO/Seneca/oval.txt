Weird orange oval light in sky.;2014-07-05 22:05:00;3 minutes;weird orange oval light in sky We were sitting on our back porch watching the fireworks show and noticed a weird glowing orange light go through one of the fireworks they set off.  Thought it may have been a plane.   It disappeared off in the tree line.   This happened again as they were setting off the finale, I asked my bf if he seen it.  It went through the display, and disappeared in the tree line, starting at the same spot as before.   The finale was set off, and here came another one from the same spot (they appeared from underneath the moon,to our left, the display was to the right.    They were all moving at a speed slower than the wind.  I snapped a pic of the last one.  It also disappeared into to tree line and was gone.   We waited to see if it happened again, and it didn't.   Very strange.;36.8394;-94.5725
