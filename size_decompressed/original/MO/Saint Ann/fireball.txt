It seemed to be low to the ground, not like a falling star.  It was so low as we drove by the homes I looked to see if there was a fire in someones backyard.   I yelled to my two daughters and their friend.  What was that?  They looked around on the street and said What?  I said, In the sky.  But it was gone.   While watching ksdk news tonite at l0:00 pm the weatherman said a lady called and said she saw a ball of fire in the sky, then he proceeded to talk about a meteor shower we are expecting to  have later tonight.   I don't have any idea what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??PD));38.7199;-90.3889
