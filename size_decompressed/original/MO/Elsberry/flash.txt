flash and then rapid acceleration of light through mid level cloud cover;2003-01-04 06:25:00;2 seconds;flash and then rapid acceleration of light through mid level cloud cover i was on my way to work and at the top of a bluff, before the road decended into the mississippi river valley, a bright flash through the clouds could be seen through the windshield. the glow then shot off towards southwest at an extremely high rate of speed. it was still quite dark when this happened. it was quite unlike any meteor i have ever seen. the rate of acceleration was much faster than any known aircraft i have ever observed as well.;39.1554;-90.815
