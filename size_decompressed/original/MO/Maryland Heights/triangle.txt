The craft was traveling south to south west at what looked at maybe 500-800 feet high.  When it crossed over the hwy I noticed there was no red blinking light, and once it was to my right, I can see the outline if the craft.  It was a perfect equilateral triangle (all sides same length).  With a light at each corner.  So a triangle craft with 3 lights.   I saw craft for approximately 20-30 seconds.;38.7251821138212;-90.4480121951219
