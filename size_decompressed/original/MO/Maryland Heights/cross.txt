Craft vanishes from clear skies.;2018-07-21 08:30:00;5 minutes;Craft vanishes from clear skies. The craft was coming from northeast to southwest, got close enough that we could see two blinking lights so thought it was just a plane, didnâ€™t come close enough to be able to see clearly that it was a plane, blinking lights were not very far apart.   I walked off our deck into the grass, looking away for maybe 5 seconds.  The craft was nowhere to be found, skies perfectly clear there is no possible way for it to just disappear being close enough to see blinking lights.;38.7251821138212;-90.4480121951219
