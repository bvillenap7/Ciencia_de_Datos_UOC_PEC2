Two unidentifiable objects flying quickly and in an unusual path.;2011-02-13 15:36:00;5 seconds;On February 13, 2011, at approximately 15:30, in Maryland Heights Missouri, I was called out to the balcony by a friend to observe the heaviest chemtrails we had ever witnessed.  I subsequently recorded a few minutes of the chemtrails.  I immediately downloaded and viewed the video.  To my surprise, at 2 minutes 9 seconds into the recording there are two unidentifiable objects flying quickly and in an unusual path.  One of the objects can be seen for approximately 5 seconds.;38.7251821138212;-90.4480121951219
