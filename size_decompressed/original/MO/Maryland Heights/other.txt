shiny oval like object over maryland heights area;2009-10-24 16:15:00;3 minutes;shiny oval like object over maryland heights area I was just getting home from work and noticed something very shinny in the clear blue skies above my apartment. I sat and watched this object hover about 300-500 feet above with NO NOISE moving west at about 20 mph for approximately 1 minute.  I snapped a picture of this object then ran inside and grabbed my binoculars, and had my mom come come view this with me.  When I looked at the object through the binoculars the object was not solid, it seemed to look like orbs of light bunched together. The object then got to far to see anymore.;38.7251821138212;-90.4480121951219
