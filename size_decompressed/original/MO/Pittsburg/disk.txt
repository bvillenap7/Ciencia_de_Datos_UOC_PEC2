A group of 5 was looking in the sky to watch a hot air balloon take off. While watching this we happened to see a bright blue light play in the sky then shoot off. Lasted a total maybe 2 to 3 seconds. I did catch this on video. I booked in on a few screenshots I took and you could see the windows or so it appeared. It looked like it was hovering and when we light the balloon is when we noticed it take off.;37.8421;-93.332
