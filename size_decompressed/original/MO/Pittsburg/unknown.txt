((Meteor??));2006-12-08 19:30:00;3 seconds;Dec. 8th 2006 7:30 PM saw bright object go down over immediate horizon then flashed like it might have impacted something. I went outside to smoke a cigarette with my deaf brother some where around 7:30 PM Dec. 8th 2006.  I was facing north and the single object came from the south my backside so I didn’t noticed it after it was down to the horizon pretty low.  It had a bright appearance not yellow or dim about the size of a pea or smaller held at arms length.  The strange thing is that I thought it was a meteor but what struck me as odd was there was no trail or tail like most meteors leave not even a short one for its size!  I have seen tails or trails come from a lot smaller objects that this one. There wasn’t even any sparks like a sparkler so to speak coming from the object.  It came down on a 45 degree angle or steeper. After the object that was way off in the distance probably miles away disappeared down behind a tree line 100 feet up the hill from where I was standing my brother and I saw a bright flash come from its immediate direction like maybe it impacted something some where.  I have never seen a meteor quite like it and have never seen one go down and then flash the way this did. I don’t think it was a UFO but how do I know?  I really just wanted to report it and maybe somebody could explain to me what the heck it was or if was tracked by someone or observed buy any one else. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??
