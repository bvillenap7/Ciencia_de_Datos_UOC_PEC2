Very bright light near sundown.;2014-07-14 20:45:00;1 minute;Very bright light near sundown. My wife and I were traveling home around 8:45 that evening when I spotted a very bright light in the northwest sky.  As it was still fairly light out this object really caught my attention.  It seemed to be moving in a southeasterly direction, but the speed was hard to judge since it was moving toward us. After about 20 seconds I pointed it out to my wife, and she said she had just noticed it as well.  I asked her what she thought it might be, and neither of us had any idea.  About 1 minute after I had first seen it, the object just disappeared.  It didn't seem to have turned or changed altitude, it was just suddenly gone. I was not able to see any auxiliary lights or blinking lights either when the light was visible OR in the area it had been after it disappeared, leading me to believe it was not an aircraft of any kind.  There was also enough daylight left that if it were a helicopter they would have no use for a spotlight as it wouldn't illuminate the ground any more than the ambient light was, especially from the height it was at. About 5 minutes after the object disappeared, I noticed that some stars were starting to be barely visible, so I'm positive that what we saw wasn't a star, nor was it a reflection off of any object as the sun was setting. My wife and I are both college educated people who are usually able to come to a rational conclusion regarding most any event, but this has both of us stumped as to what we saw.  We've lived in this area for almost 15 years and neither of us has ever seen anything like this.;40.444;-95.3742
