Last night (1//5/21) at 10:00pm while watching tv at home in Richmond Missouri there was a noise that at first I thought was a snow plow,  But it Kept getting louder. I stepped outside to have a look, After not seeing anything for about a Minute a black aircraft was overhead At first I assumed it was a  B2 going by the sound also it was moving south east towards whiteman afb. The more I have been thinking about it today some things are not normal. The craft was extremely low, it was vibrating the house. The B2 does fly over sometimes but never even close to that low, I'd estimate Under 1000 feet probably closer to 500. When it went over it was flying Very slow, Comparable to an airliner right before touchdown but there's no place to land close to here. I looked at adbs and flightaware to see what it was and where it came from but it wasn't showing up on either. Lastly the only lights were two red solid on what I'd guess to be wing tips, It did appear to be flying level. I watched it go straight until it was too far away. Unfortunately even with it being so close I couldn't make out any details or shape really it seemed triangle. It was Cloudy and it didn't silhouette very well at all. After spending the day thinking and trying to look up answers only to find none, nothing would help. I've talked to others who heard it but didn't go out to see.;39.2832;-93.9716
