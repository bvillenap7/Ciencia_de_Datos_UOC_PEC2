My mother and I were driving home from Lexington, Missouri on Interstate 70, heading east. One of us noticed what looked like a star that kept moving around the sky. It would move really fast to the left, then slowly move to the right, then move really fast another direction. At this point we knew it wasn't a plane or helicopter because it would move fast, then slow and move up, down, to the right or to the left. After about 10 or 15 minutes of watching this, it disappeared.;39.0718;-93.7114
