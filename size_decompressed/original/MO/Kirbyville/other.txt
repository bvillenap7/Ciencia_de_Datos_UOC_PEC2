I realized that the object was moving much too slow to be in orbit. After about 45 min. I realized this needs to be reported to NUFORC and called Mr. Davenport with an excited real time observation. Mr. Davenport suggested I contact someone else to verify the sighting. I managed to get three other groups of people to look and verify the same object. At least 8 people saw it at four different locations with aproximatly 60 mi. separation. Description, Point of light, strobe like, bright flash then 3 seconds later a dim flash then 7 seconds later a bright flash. This pattern repeated steady for approx. 90 min. Near the end flashing dimmed and became irregular, flash,three seconds,flash two seconds, flash five seconds then became chaotic and would fade from sight. The entire time I had and used 10x50 binocs. but object was visible to unaided eye entire time. Entire time object moved east only the length of a hand at arms length. Stars were rotating much faster than object moved. Object stayed nearly due south and approx. 45 deg. above the horizon. Color, white /  flash rate 3 seconds then 7 seconds/  direction, due south/ time, approx 2030 to 2205 CST/ length of observation, approx. 90 min./ area of sky seen in, first observed between Aquila and Sagittarius then slowly moved eastward to the edges of Capricornus and Aquarius/ observers at this location, myself age 46 and my daughter 14/ background of principal observer, ex USAF 206X0 SCI, very serious amature astronomer/ called friend with years of shared stargazing and on phone (approx. 60 mi. separation) confirmed same observed flashing timing and position with no discernable parralox shift.;36.5792;-93.1263

I took my girls out to go potty.  Something bright drew my eyes to the sky.  I saw a very fast moving object.  It was such a light silver, the shape is hard to describe. It was almost cone, teardrop shape. . But not quite.  I heard my neighbor outside and called her, but by the time she got there it had disappeared.  This is not my first dighting, but my first time reporting it.;36.5792;-93.1263
