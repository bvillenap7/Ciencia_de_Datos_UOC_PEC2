Whitish silver elongated cylinder or rectangle moving across the sky without sound or contrails;2017-07-17 20:10:00;5 minutes;whitish silver elongated cylinder or rectangle moving across the sky without sound or contrails At about 8:10 pm on 7/17/2017 in Kirbyville, MO, my husband pointed into the sky for me to look.  There was a silver/white cylinder or rectangle like object traveling across the sky from NE to SW.   It moved in a straight line, at a steady speed, without sound or trail of any type behind it.  It didnâ€™t change directions but at one point, I noticed it shimmer like a mirror, as if it tipped and the sunlight hit it.   We tried to capture it on video with his smart phone but neither of us could see it displayed on the camera, even though it was clearly visible.   We watched it for about 5 minutes before it moved out of sight.;36.5792;-93.1263
