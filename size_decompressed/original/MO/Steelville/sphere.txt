I noticed a silver shining sphere like object to the west of the noonday sun. I watched the object move east towards the sun at the rate of speed of a comercial airliner.  I had to keep  glancing up as it moved closer to the sun due to the glare.  At the same time I noticed the reception on my radio became poor and scrambled.  I also noticed the vehicle traveling ahead of me had slowed down and appeared to be watching the object also.  As I descended the hill into Steelville the object disappeared.;37.8893;-91.3021
