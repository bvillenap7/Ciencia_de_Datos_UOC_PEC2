The light moved quickly across the sky to the East.;2005-03-14 23:50:00;10 seconds;The light moved quickly across the sky to the East. My friend and I are students at local colleges and our backgrounds would not suggest either of us are cranks.  Both of us were in different cars and driving to the same destination but on different routes.  I saw the light appear in the sky and move away quickly.  It was obscured by some trees and when I got past the trees, I lost site of it.  I called my friend to tell him and he saw the same thing.  A mile or so ahead, as I was turning my car on a different road, I saw the object again.  I was now traveling north while it moved east.  I saw it appear to vanish as it went off in the distance.  It is worth noting that I a few nights ago, while standing outside near this same location, I saw a light in the sky go off in one direction, then another light appear and travel in the other.;39.2489999999999;-94.4232
Orange lights (7) over Liberty, MO flying in V shape;2006-10-28 00:20:00;4sec;Orange lights (7) over Liberty, MO flying in V shape Looked up when laying on a rooftop and saw what I mistaked as a simple meteor at first..but was corrected when I realized the lights had no trails, and were not diminishing and kept a simple round shape...and were too slow for a shooting star, but far too fast for any aircraft, noticed a single light first then realized there were others behind it and to the sides, noticed a V flying shape with 3 lights flanking each side of an orange light, all lights were the same shape, traveled the same speed, and lasted untill they were out of sight due to a building next to where I was...they were also all the same size and color.  Quick duration, about 4 seconds...the lights went on presumably, but I could only see them for four seconds before they dissapeered from my view behind another building.;39.2489999999999;-94.4232
Clear night. These very tiny solid lights were traveling from the SSW to the NNE. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-18 21:00:00;5-7 minutes;Clear night. These very tiny solid lights were traveling from the SSW to the NNE.  About 40-50 degrees off the horizon.  Just below Venus I believe at this time.  Each light were the same distant from each other all traveling the same speed.  Can tell they where very high/far off in space.;39.2489999999999;-94.4232
