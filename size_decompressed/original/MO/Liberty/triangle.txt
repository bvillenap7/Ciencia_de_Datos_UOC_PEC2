We were returning home from Perkins when, on Kansas St. heading east, we saw a triangular craft hovering above a residence across from a public school.  The sky was overcast, and it was very windy.  The craft was below the clouds, as evidenced by the reflection of its lights.  We stopped our van and looked and listened, hearing nothing.  No props, no blades, no engines.  We turned left onto the street the residence was facing, and as we did so, the craft moved northwest.  We persued it as best we could through the residential area, but in a matter of 1-2 minutes it was beyond the horizon.  We made our way back, and in doing so saw another craft, which at first appeared to be a helicopter, then a plane, then, as we saw it better, exactly like the first.  It made no sound.  Both craft were black, with white lights on the triangle tips and a red light in the center.  Only the first appeared to hover. I am a college student attending William Jewell College in Liberty, MO, and my friend is a high-school Junior attending Rockhurst College in Kansas City, MO. Since seeing the craft, we have witnessed over half a dozen normal aircraft in the area.  Normally, I see none.;39.2489999999999;-94.4232
Multi-colored lights in a wide V-formation, hovering, hose or shaft of light lowering with light on end;2004-10-29 21:00:00;5 minutes;Multi-colored lights in a wide V-formation, hovering, hose or shaft of light lowering with light on end This occured about 9:00-9:30 p.m.   I was driving home from the grocery store and it was lightly raining.  It's all residential where I was driving, and something caught my eye out to the left.   There is a lot of pasture that is being developed and as I drove around this winding 2-lane, I looked out to a clearing, and there were these red, blue, yellow, white, lights in a really large triangular shape.  The crazy thing is that this thing was very large and hovering over the ground approximately 2-3 miles up.   Hanging from this object was like a hose or something being lowered.  It had almost a dull greyish-white neon appearance to it, and at the very bottom was a brighter white light.  I would have to guesstimate that this shaft was approximately 1 block long. The shaft of light appeared to not have a large circumference to it.  I thought at first it must have been some sort of hose with this light on the end of it. I thought is this thing a Stealth and these pilots are just jacking around? But from the way the lights appeared, the V was much wider then the Stealth appears.  I was a few miles away from it.  At first I thought about trying to get a closer look but I remembered I had a lot of frozen food in sacks. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Big Triangle 3 Lights Craft;2005-06-15 21:00:00;15 min;Big Triangle 3 Lights Craft My boyfriend, at the time, and I were laying in the hammock out in the country at my parent's house. A huge triangular shaped craft passed over us slowly. It was pretty low and blocked out all the stars. There were lights in the 3 corners, but the rest was black. I don't recall it being very loud. I had a sense of peace and we just watched it, even tho we should have gone to get cameras. He was in shock, but I had sightings before, just not this close and unique. It was later that I learned others had seen the same triangle. I am still reading about these sightings even now in 07 and thought I should post mine. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.2489999999999;-94.4232
