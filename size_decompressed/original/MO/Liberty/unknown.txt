Dark area in sky over Liberty, Missouri;2007-01-15 22:30:00;2 min;Dark area in sky over Liberty, Missouri About Jan. 15, 2007 at 22:30 I was taking my dog out for last time before bed. I was looking at the stars as it was a cold clear night. I noticed an area of stars that were disappearing then coming back. Something was blocking them out. If you held out your arm full length and had your index finger and thumb about two inches apart that would be about the size of the area. I watched it moving slow for about two minutes then the area got a white area about the size of a nickel. It was very bright and all white. It started to move faster and looked as if it was ascending .The light started moving to the right and getting smaller. Then it was gone. The object the whole time was moving from north to south but when it lit up it moved slightly to the east before it disappeared. I thought it might have been a satellite with a north to south orbit. After thinking about it the area was to large for a satellite. There was no sound with this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
