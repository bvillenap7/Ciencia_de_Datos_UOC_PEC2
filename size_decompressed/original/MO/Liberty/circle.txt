very strange seeing these so often!  ((NUFORC Note:  Stars.  PD));2010-11-19 01:00:00;started earlier and it no;very strange seeing these so often! For several nights there are things in the sky that look like stars but have blinking red and blue lights on the bright white star like object.  When you look through binoculars you see some similarities in some and some diffrences.  Some have a fast cirlce of flashing red and blue lights rotating like a ferris wheel.  Also tonight I saw a stream of brilliant lights(through the binoculars) that were like a shorter rainbow shooting from the area that the these blinking lights were.  I have been seeing several recently every night. I have been researching the net as I am wondering what these are and noticed other people are reporting the same.  Could they be satellites?   I saw a few when I was in Omaha, NE about 3 weeks ago.  My son is here and he sees the same.  My daughter and her boyfriend saw them about a week or so again when I was viewing them.

Two stationary bright round objects spaced 1/2 mile apart in broad daylight.;2019-06-20 19:00:00;30-40 minutes;two stationary bright round objects spaced 1/2 mile apart in broad daylight Around 7pm +- 20 minutes, we noticed two bright stationary objects high in the sky, looking up towards the north.  They remained motionless as planes went underneath them.  They were about 1/2 mile apart and must have been very large as using commercial jets underneath as a reference. The sighting lasted approximately 30 min.  We took pictures and small video, looking at the picture blown up, it appeared to be round and glowing as bright as the sun.  Really remarkable and know other people around Kansas City, MO, had to have seen same objects. We will be looking to the same area tonight to see if by chance maybe a planet was the culprit.  However, it was inside our atmosphere.;39.2489999999999;-94.4232
