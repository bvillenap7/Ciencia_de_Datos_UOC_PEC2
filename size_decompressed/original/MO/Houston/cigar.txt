We saw two cigar shaped very thin objects in the distance just above the treeline at sunset.  At first, there appeared to be only one black object vertically in the sky stationary.  Another black thin cigar shaped object then appeared above it and stopped moving for a while before it began moving upward away from the first object and the first stationary object curved to the left and started moving slowly.
