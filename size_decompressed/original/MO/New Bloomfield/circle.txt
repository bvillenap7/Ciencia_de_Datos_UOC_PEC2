Strobe like yellow lights hovering in the sky.;2017-06-24 21:30:00;60 minutes;Strobe like yellow lights hovering in the sky. We saw irregular flashing lights that occurred in a circular pattern.  At first it seemed like it could be a sort of plane but the lights didn't move as a jet would.  They moved slightly up then slightly down, hovered for a few minutes, dropped lower in the sky and proceeded very slowly to the right.  The lights seemed to come from a fairly large craft but it was hard to tell due to distance. The lights disappeared for a while, but then reappeared a few minutes later in another spot.  We did not know if this was the same craft that somehow got to an entirely different place in the sky without us seeing or another craft entirely.  This one was closer and the lights were brighter.  It followed the same hover pattern for a few minutes and this too drifted out of our line of sight.   As we stood there this same thing happened two more times--flashing lights in different parts of the sky (I would describe them as having a strobe like effect).  The craft would hover and go slightly up, down and sideways for a few minutes before drifting off.  There was no noise and the only color we saw was whitish yellow light.  It wasn't shining a light as a helicopter might do if it was performing a search but more or less just twinkeled.  I do not know how it was able to appear in different parts of the sky without us seeing it get there.  All of the sightings ended when the lights drifted behind a structure or the trees.;38.711;-92.0803
