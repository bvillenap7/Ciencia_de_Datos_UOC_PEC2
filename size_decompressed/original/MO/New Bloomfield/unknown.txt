Red-orange crescent shaped light hanging above tree line, then faded out of sight.;2019-06-06 23:35:00;3 minutes;Red-orange crescent shaped light hanging above tree line, then faded out of sight. I was letting my dogs outside and glanced up, when I caught sight of a lightning bug flashing past.  I live in the middle of town and was facing West, when I noticed a red-orange crescent shape just in line with some trees.  At first I thought it was the moon, because tonight there is a waxing crescent, so I wasn't paying too much attention to it at first.  I looked away and back a few times, noting what I thought was a dark, rounded glove or sphere shape with the light curved along one edge, which is why initially thought it was the moon.  I glanced away to call my dogs back in, and when I looked back up, the crescent shaped light began to fade.  After about 15 more seconds the light faded out completely.
