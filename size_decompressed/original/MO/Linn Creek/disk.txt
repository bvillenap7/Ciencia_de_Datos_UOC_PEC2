Silver saucer shaped object vanishes when approached by helicopter.;2003-06-08 13:17:00;4-5 minutes;Silver saucer shaped object vanishes when approached by helicopter. My mom and I were on our way to Camdenton, MO on highway West 54.  I was looking up at the sky like I usually do when I spotted a silver saucer shaped object.  I thought maybe it was just my imagination, so I asked my mom who was driving if she saw the same thing and she did.  It just hovered there, then we saw what we believed to be an army helicopter approach the object.  Then the object just vanished like it was never there in the first place.;38.06;-92.6833
