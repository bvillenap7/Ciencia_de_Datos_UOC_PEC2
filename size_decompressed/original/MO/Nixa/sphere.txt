It made a loud buzzing noise.  Also, I saw a star that just stayed in the same spot the whole night.  You know how as the Earth rotates the stars get higher into the air?  Not this one.   It also changed colors every few seconds.   There were about five helicopters in the area. I also saved a video of the star on my mom's Palm Treo. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.
