Covering the distance of horizon to horizon in seconds. On May 28 2012 at approximately 8pm my 12 year old son and I was in our front yard preparing to grill some hamburgers for dinner.  My son asked me what an object was in the sky.  I quickly looked and was in sure.  It did not look like any type of airplane I had ever seen. It was a &quotpill&quot shaped object much like a Tylenol tablet.  I would estimate it was at a high altitude much like a commercial airliner.  There was no noticeable wing span visually or when I zoomed in with my phone camera.   When I noticed the object it was slightly above the tree line of my viewable horizon.  I quickly took a picture of the object with my phone.  The object was moving in a straight line but very rapidly and was hard to follow with my camera.  I had only enough time to take a second picture before it was beyond my view on the opposite horizon. There was no sound or jet trail behind the object.   I have viewed many high altitude planes in my life but have never seem anything like this or moving that rapidly.   The pictures I took were with my IPhone 4s with an 8megapixel camera zoomed in as close as I could get. ;37.0504;-93.3002
