I was out smoking and looked up at the sky  and noticed a red and orange light.  It looked like some kind of object on fire in the sky.   It was moving very slowly, so I grabbed my mother and showed her, she got super freaked out .   I snapped a photo of the object and it then it disappeared into the night sky.;38.6523;-91.7749
