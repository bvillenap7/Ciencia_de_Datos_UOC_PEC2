While driving noticed one bright white flashing light.  I pointed this out to my daughter and son and said hey what's is that it's awful bright.  When it turned into three bright white lights in the shape of a cigar.  My son started screaming to give him my phone and pull over.  I did he jumped out and the three lightss split into separate pieces.  All going in different direction.  I started driving home and we kept our eye on the sky.  Pulled off on gravel to head home and a hundred yards off road was one of the objects hovering.  The whole thing pulsed light changing from white to blue to red once in awhile.  We where afraid to drive past it so turned car around and headed back towards town.  As we were driving the object took off and follows our path and stayed in sight to us.  We decided others had to see and turned back to make it home.when home, noticed several more.  Watched them all night in front of house in field.  Kept joining together and seperating into other lights.  Not sure what we saw.;39.1594;-93.2436
