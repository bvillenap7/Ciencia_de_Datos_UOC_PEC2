We saw 3 meteors and only one seemed to appear brighter and flamed out.  Then about 3 mins later a gray shape appeared in the eastern portion of the sky line. we stood up and pointed at this gray shape that I thought were a flock of birds until it changed shape.  This shape change appeared to look like a stingray and flapped its wings.  It took 3 to 5 seconds to cross the skyline above our pool. We could not see thru this object.  This object was totally silent. The size of the object was like holding up a quarter and looking at it as though it was in the sky.  This object was oval and oblong and seemed to have winged points expand from the sides. This object moved from the east to the west directly above our pool.  I thought it was migratory birds.  No lights and No sounds.  This sighting was extremely odd. no planes were in the sky.  At this time the sky was clear and bright. we both spoke at length as to wha! t just happened.  We believe we saw an object larger than a bird. larger than 100 birds that fly around each other to keep warm.  Not a plane because no lights or sounds.  This object took the shape of a stingray but we could not make out any tail.   This sighting made such an impression that we spoke about filing a notice.  Something did fly over our head and was silent with no lights or sound.;36.6495;-94.4428
