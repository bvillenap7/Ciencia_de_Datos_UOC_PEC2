We were driving home on state highway AB outside of Willard Missouri.  We saw an orange glowing sphere moving thoough the sky very slowly.  We pulled over at a closed gas station to watch it and see if it had any navigational beacons.  My uncle is a pilot, and has taught me about aircraft recognition.  There were no navigational beacons or flashing lights.  It was a constantly glowing orange sphere moving backwards and forewards across the sky very slowly.
