Possible UFO sightings are likely balloons.;2009-08-07 21:00:00;30 min to 1 hr;Possible UFO sightings are likely balloons. This is not a UFO report, but rather an explanation of objects observed on this evening, which may be reported by many as UFO's.  I observed the lights and had planned on reporting them here, but failed to do so.  When I went to work, a fellow employee mentioned an event which he attended where luminaria's were launched in balloons the same evening I observed the lights.  The balloons drifted quite a distance at approximately 1-2 miles altitude.;39.0012;-90.9624000000002
