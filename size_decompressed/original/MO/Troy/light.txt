When I looked up towards east in the sky I saw a oval shaped royal blue light that sat there for a second or two then very quickly, with great speed horizontally shot off disapearing fast.  I looked towards my friend and said did you see that?  His reply was yes.;39.0012;-90.9624000000002
Possible UFO siting? Three bright orange objects...;2010-08-14 20:40:00;5-10 minutes;Possible UFO siting? Three bright orange objects... I went out into my driveway with my younger sister and we were just talking and messing around. It was getting later in the evening, but it wasn't yet completely dark.  I noticed a bright orange light coming from behind a neighbor's house.  From what I could see, it looked like it was in a round shape, but had something that branched off the side of it, only one side.  Definitely not an airplane wing.  It was moving probably a bit slower than what an airplane would be and my sister and I watched as it veered off to the left (from our view) headed for a big, thick cloud, as it was cloudy that evening. It wasn't until the second one came from the exact same place in the exact position that we went in to get our mom. We were kind of freaked out by it, but weren't sure exactly what we were seeing. By the time the three of us returned outside, the first one had gone into the cloud and the second one was headed in the same direction.  We waited to see if the first one would come back out of the cloud from a different direction, but it never did and eventually, the second one did the same thing.  Then we saw a third one.  It moved just as the first two had and disappeared within the cloud. We stood outside for quite a few minutes watching and waiting, but nothing ever reappeared and no more were seen. UFOs? One never knows, but just could beâ€¦;39.0012;-90.9624000000002
