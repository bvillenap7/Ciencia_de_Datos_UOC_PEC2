Way up high, star height from the ground, looked like a sperm that flew squares.   Had my wife come out and she said it changed colors, but it was really at a high altitude.  I am an instrument rated pilot and have never seen anything change directions like this.  It flew circles and squares.  Wow.;39.0012;-90.9624000000002
