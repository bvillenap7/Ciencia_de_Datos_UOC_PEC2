Unknown triangular (Kite-like) seen in sky over home;2003-10-30 22:00:00;20-30 seconds;Unknown triangular (Kite-like) seen in sky over home On October 30, I went outside at 10:00 o' clock to walk my dogs. I looked up in the sky because we had heard some people were seeing the Aurora lights. I was disappointed that I didn't see anything. Then coming out of the NW, I saw a strange looking object. It was a triangular like object (when I drew out what I had seen it was like an upside down kite in shape). There were 4 lights that were visible to me-one in the front, 1 in the back, and 1 on each side. They were yellow lights, and they were not blinking as in most commercial aircraft.It had come from the NW, and it appeared to be heading SE as it went over my home. As it went over my home, it appeared to quickly turn a little more the East instead of going just straight to the SE. The craft appeared to move like it was gliding, but it was so quick. There was no sound coming from it. It was a very clear night out. The stars were shining. There was a light breeze. The object was hard to estimate how high that it was. It appeared to be 500-1000 feet or so. If I held my fist up in the air, it appeared to cover it. That is the best way I can describe how high up.;39.0012;-90.9624000000002
