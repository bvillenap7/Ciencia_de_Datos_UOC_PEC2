Big orange ball shaped object, silent, flew overhead in Troy, MO.;2014-04-26 20:53:00;3-4 minutes;Big orange ball shaped object, silent, flew overhead in troy mo. viewed at 20:55 on 04262014 in the South South East sky color orange solid did not change or pulse viewed it into the north northwest sky.  It went directly overhead and was silent estimate it at 2 to 5 thousand feet.  Sure it was not a meteor, planet, or a satellite.  It was below light wispy clouds as stars were visible.  Planes and copters frequent the area and are always  audible.  I was distracted and so did not follow until it was out of view.  I believe that it was going too fast to be a balloon. Have included two stellarium sky views  with what should have been visible in the sky at that time, with a illustration of the object photoshoped into them.
