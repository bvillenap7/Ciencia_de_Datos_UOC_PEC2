Star/Planet Shaped Flying Object;2010-06-28 23:30:00;Ten to Fifteen Seconds;Star/Planet Shaped Flying Object My fianc√©e and I were sitting on the patio watching the sky.  We noticed an object that looked like a planet or star moving across the sky. At first we thought it might be a satellite.  As the object came closer to being directly over us, it turned red and disappeared.  About one hour later (give or take), another object appeared and disappeared.  The second object did not turn red. The conditions were a clear night, normal starry night.  The airplane traffic was normal for the time of evening and is always to the south of us.  The objects came from the west going east.  We were on the north side of our home.  There was no aircraft in pursuit or near the objects.  No missing time, strange happenings etc.;39.0012;-90.9624000000002
