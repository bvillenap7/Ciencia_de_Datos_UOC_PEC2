Also i suspect many UFO's are in fact real.  They are U.S. military. Including experimental craft. I suspect an airborne craft, PROBABLY MILITARY, EMPLOYING A  laser beam and a computer could do great crop circles in an English wheat field. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides little contact information.  I doubt that a laser beam could be used to cause a standing crop to be pressed down against the soil, as is often seen to be the case in instances of genuine crop formations.  PD));36.7251;-91.8719
