Circular lights in sky over Fort Leonard Wood, MO;2010-05-25 21:30:00;5 Seconds;Circular lights in sky over Fort Leonard Wood, MO I was walking with my girlfriend to my house, when we stopped for a moment.  We both were looking at the night sky, and she pointed to the southwest of us, and that's when she said Spaceship! and we both saw two flames (emitting a bright orange-red glow) in a perfect circles, from what looked to us, usual cruising altitude for normal jets, except, at that altitude, they are never that large. They both looked to be about 96 feet wide, and about 128 feet apart.  The one on the left disappeared, in what could be described as a dissolving manner, and the second one did the same about 1 second after. That was the end of that.;37.7673;-92.1098
