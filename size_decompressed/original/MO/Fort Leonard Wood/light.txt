Round craft hovering over interstate 44 at Fort Leonardwood;2012-07-04 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Round craft hovering over interstate 44 at Fort Leonardwood We were driving to a fireworks display in Rolla and saw a light hovering over the interstate 44.  The driver and I kept watching it as we drove under it and I turned around and pointed it out to my boys in the back seat.  They exclaimed when they saw it and continued watching it hover until we drove out of site of it.  It might have been 400 feet or so up right over the interstate.  It did not appear to move at all. It looking like a hanging ball with a glowing yellowish colored light on the bottom of it.  The light barley illuminated the bottom of the object which made it appear round in shape.  It did not seen very large perhaps big enough for 2 people to sit in???  It was very exciting and very clear it was not anything the general public would recognize as a man-made craft.;37.7673;-92.1098
