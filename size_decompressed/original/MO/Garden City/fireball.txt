Sitting on a patio visiting with family at night, we saw several (6-8?) weird, glowing orange spheres slowly move across the sky in succession.  We couldn't tell how big they were or how far away with nothing to give them scale.  It took a few minutes for each to come from one direction and disappear into the distance in the other direction.  They didn't make a sound.  In attendance were a 45-year-old electrical engineer, a 43-year-old securities attorney and the attorney's aunt and uncle who live there.;38.5677;-94.1836
