It ;2001-09-13 14:00:00;11sec;It was the day airplanes resumed flight after the sept.11 attacks. I was standing out in the pasture with my dogs enjoying the day. It was sunny with some clouds.It was around 2P.M. We live close to the airport and I was just thinking how erie it was to be so quiet.As I was scanning the sky I saw an airplane in the east and to my suprise there it was this side of the airplane. I know this because the plane flew behind the object. As the plane was moving the object was not. MY first reaction was disbelief. I did not take my eyes off the object. It was cigar shaped, silver.It engulfed the airplane as the airplane flew behind the object. It did not move. It seemed the sun was shinning on it but the shape was very defined. The plane kept moving and the object was still.I counted 11 as I was thinking this has to be real because the airport has just opened, no blimps, no small aircraft, no helicopters were allowed.Then as I blinked it was gone. I stood there thinking no one will believe me. And, I have not told anyone except my husband until now.;39.3644;-94.3634
