I happened to see a large circle orange and red and about 16 feet it floated and was low to the gtound.  It was floating in the tree line, it floated across the street on to the other side of the road, into the trees and disappeared.   We had thought we would see it come out of the trees but never did.  It also had no soundâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.3644;-94.3634
