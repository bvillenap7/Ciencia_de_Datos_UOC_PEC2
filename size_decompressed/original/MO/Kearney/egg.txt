As I sat out on my deck I saw a turquoise(ish) glowing egg floating over a neighbor's house behind my house. It sort of flickered on and off for about 10 seconds. Then it materialized and started zipping back and forth at an impossible speed. Then it flew right over the roof of my house (my guess is it was about 100 feet above) and dissapeared. I would never lie about a thing like this it was freaky! I would definitely want as many people as possible to know what I saw.;39.3644;-94.3634
