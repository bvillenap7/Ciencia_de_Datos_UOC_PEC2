I was shooting off bottle rockets with my friend. I looked up and saw a very distant (vertical distance) ,but it seemed that it was large , blue , hazy circle shape , off to the south. it was a color a little lighter than cobalt. It looked like it was staying still. My friends mom was on my deck and  i asked her if she saw that and she said yes. i asked my friend ,who was shooting off bottle rockets because i wasnt at the mom (ie turns), just as i said look at it and it sounded like he said yes , i looked away and then it was gone. it was way too high to be a firework, and way too bright to be a plane or helicopter, plus i couldnt hear any noise like that because my neighbors had stopped shooting off stuff for about 30 min. it was high enough that i couldn't tell if it was over St.Charles County,or over St.Lous County because we are very close.;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
Observed extremely bright object in the sky.;1998-12-13 06:45:00;8-10 minutes;Observed extremely bright object in the sky. I was driving in a westbound direction on Missouri Highway 94 South very early in the morning.  The sky was becoming light but the sun had not risen yet.  As I came over the top of a ridge I saw an extremely bright light in the sky ahead of me that appeared to be moving down towards the horizon in a gradual, steady motion and also appeared to be shimmering or pulsating.  Being somewhat of a skeptic I attributed the movement I perceived to the fact that I was coming over the top of a ridge and going back down the other side and I attributed the shimmering aspect the the crisp cold air.  As I came across the next ridge the object now was in full view and stayed in the same position for the next several minutes.  It really grabbed my attention because it was at least three to four times brighter than a star.  I thought several times that it was possibly a planet in the morning sky buy it was extremely bright, a white/silver color. I continued to observe the object for several minutes while it appeared to be stationary.  There was no movement and as the morning light increased there was no change in the brightness of the object.  I stopped at the QT quick mart at the intersection of Hwy 94 and O'Fallon Rd to grab a soda and a bag of pretzels.  As I stepped out of my car I gazed at the object for a period to try to ascertain exactly what it might be, it was extremely bright, still about three to four times brighter than the brightest star I have observed and in the western morning sky all by itself.  I quickly ran in to get what I needed, I would guess it took me a total of 45 seconds to one minute because I knew exactly what I wanted and I was the only customer in the store.  When I stepped out of the store the first thing I did was look up where the object had been to look at it again and it was gone!  This was obviously not a plane or a star.;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
Bright neon green light hovered then broke the sound barrier as it took off.;2008-07-08 03:00:00;10 seconds;Bright neon green light hovered then broke the sound barrier as it took off. My two friends and I were on the back porch talking late at night and bright neon green light lit up our faces.   As we looked up the bright light hovered above us for about 3 seconds with no sound, then took off north fast enough to break the sound barrier.  It made a sonic boom an small vibration as it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
I saw a very low light, definitely not a plane as there was only a bright white light like a star, no flashing red lights and no noise.;2010-10-27 19:00:00;5 minutes;Report taken by the Missouri Investigators Group    http://ufomig.yolasite.com   I saw a very low light, definitely not a plane as there was only a bright white light like a star, no flashing red lights and no noise. It was moving very slowly from West to East, maybe 1,000 feet in the air.  I only guess because I could see 3 airplanes in the sky and they were clearly 20,000 - 30,000 feet in the sky.   This light was much much lower and as stated earlier, it was only 1 light, not flashing and moving very slow and no noise.;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
I then noticed two red balls of light traveling from the west  (approximately along the path of I-70).;2017-06-17 22:30:00;5-8 minutes;Saturday, June 17, 2017, 22:30 hours St. Charles / St. Peters Missouri I live approximately 2 miles south of Interstate Highway 70, and about 3 miles west of the Missouri River. At 10:30 pm this evening I went outside in my back yard to secure the patio furniture for incoming storms that were predicted.  The rear of my house faces due north.  I looked up into the sky and saw lightning far off in the distance towards the north.   I then noticed two red balls of light traveling from the west  (approximately along the path of I-70) moving to the east at a fairly rapid speed. At first I thought it might be a helicopter, or two.  As they came closer, I heard no sound from any type of engine.  Two lights travelling the same distance apart in the same path.  Red orange in color, not blinking, but solid the entire time. As they came from the west, about the time they were directly behind my home, the lead light turned due north and appeared to gain altitude, fading from view, possibly behind clouds.  The second light followed the exact same path as the first one, and also disappeared. About two to three minutes later, from the south west of my home, and closer to my home, I saw three additional lights, the exact same appearance as the first two.  The first two were closer together, with the third one trailing a bit behind.   I called my wife out to see what I was seeing, and to bring her cell phone to take pictures.  She arrived, and confirmed that she was seeing what I was seeing.  She tried to take pictures, but they did not turn out very well. Again, the three objects followed the same path of the first two, and turned due north, fading away from my view.   No sound of any engine was ever heard, no other color of light was ever seen other than the red/orange solid light color. At first I thought it might be a Japanese lantern display of some kind, but the objects were moving too fast, and the winds were from the northeast, the opposite direction that the objects were moving.  The two separate groups maintained a distinct separation distance from each other, and equal speed.  Hot air Japanese lanterns would not behave this way. Aircraft routinely fly over our home as they move into the landing pattern for St. Louis Int. Airport Lambert Field.   I know what an aircraft looks and sounds like, and how it behaves.  I do not believe these objects to have been aircraft. I am not a believer in aliens, or UFOâ€™s.  I like to believe that there is a logical explanation for what my wife and I both clearly saw in the sky this evening.  See attached jpg map of the flight path of these objects;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
