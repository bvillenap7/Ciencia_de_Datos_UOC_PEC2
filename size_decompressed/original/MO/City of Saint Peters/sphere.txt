Spheres in Triangle Formation;2002-08-15 06:00:00;15 minutes;Spheres in Triangle Formation I was working in the early morning at a fast food restaurant on Jungermann and Hwy 94.  When taking out the trash, I noticed three shiny silver spheres in the sky in a perfect triangle formation.  They were not moving in any direction, just hovering, and slightly wobbling.   I'm not good at distances, but I believe they were much lower than most commercial airplanes fly, maybe only a couple thousand feet in the air.  I got some of my co-workers and all of them saw the object too.  Since I had to be coming in and out of the restaurant, I never got to see them leave, I just came outside once and they were gone.;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
