Photos show strange disk moving across sky;2012-02-26 19:00:00;5 minutes;Photos show strange disk moving across sky I was photographing the planets and moon around 7 p.m. and noticed something moving across the sky.  It moved very smoothly and was not a bird.  It did not resemble a plane or a meteor.   I did not think much about it and assumed it had an explanation.  With the naked eye it was only a tiny spot.  Upon reviewing my photographs later, I saw through the series of photos an object moving across the sky - and in one photo there is a clear disk shape.   I am an amateur photographer so the photos are not great but I would love an expert to analyze them and determine what it was.   I am shaken by this - the photos are strange indeed.  I was on my deck about one story high, shooting from my sliding door (toward the back yard).;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
Stepped outside to watch fireworks and saw more than I bargained for.;2013-07-05 22:20:00;30 seconds;Stepped outside to watch fireworks and saw more than I bargained for. I've never seen anything in the sky that I would describe as, unnatural or unexplainable, but tonight that  changed. (5JULY2013)   At almost exactly 10:20pm CST, I was getting ready to walk out onto my back deck to watch some of the fireworks that many of our neighbors were shooting off.  We live on an unincorporated street between two cities and so people come to this neighborhood to shoot them off legally. I walked out the back sliding glass door, which faces North, and in the NE I saw a light that was far more definitive than any firework.  It was consistent and moved toward my direction at a hovering, casual pace.   As it came closer, the lights and shape became more defined.  It was difficult to say a distance but my best guess at its closest proximity - 2 miles away.  If I had to judge relative size, I'd say a 50 meter diameter.   I always imagined something more extravagant if I ever saw an object I couldn't rationally explain but the object had a saucer style shape with a small ball on top.  Colors rolled from the underbelly of the disc, all the way up to the ball from a soft yellow, to a dull orange and the ball was almost red. I saw it coming in for about 10 secs, at its closest proximity for about 10 secs, silent and motionless, in which time I yelled twice to my neighbors two house down, Does anybody see that?!  I'm certain that the fireworks and children yelling drowned out my voice or they simply thought I wasn't talking to them because nobody responded.  I took out my phone and called a friend to tell him about what I was witnessing.  In about another 10 secs, it silently slipped away at exponential speed, directly north and then up, out of sight. I considered fireworks, some sort of RC device and anything I could imagine within human or natural capacity...I'm just left with questions and curiosity.;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
# disk shaped objects with red glow.;2014-06-27 00:00:00;Walking;# disk shaped objects with red glow I seen 3 different disk shaped objects in the sky w/red glow on the bottom.  They were silent,made no noise as they flew over me.  They all came 1 at a time about a minute from each other.It was while a storm front was rolling in.  They were flying low enough to see they were NOT airplanes or helicopters.  I tried to take pics w/my phone but I dont think they came out,  I dont know how to retrieve the pics from my camera phone.;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
