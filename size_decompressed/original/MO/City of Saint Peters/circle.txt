Orange glowing light seen over Saint Peters Missouri 7/27/12;2012-07-27 23:00:00;1 minute;Orange glowing light seen over Saint Peters Missouri 7/27/12 While having a cigarette, I noticed a round orange light traveling across the sky.  It was faster than a normal plane and had no blinking lights.  It was simply an orange glowing circle that traveled across the sky for about 1 minute and disappeared or burn out.  There was NO tail observed.  It appeared to be a fireball, but once again there was no tail.  I have seen shooting stars and it was not one of them. I thought possible space junk but no tail.   Strange.  It traveled in a southern direction and then simply disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

My wife and I were heading back to our car after watching a movie and an orange glowing object was in the sky directly in front of us.  It stayed in place for about two minutes.  I went to grab my camera and the object slowly came in my direction.  The light went out and it glided directly above me.   While it was dark outside, being directly above me, I clearly saw a circular object glide over my head and disappear.
