2 Red Fireballs travelling North to South;2011-09-07 20:30:00;30-45sec;2 Red Fireballs travelling North to South 2 red craft about 15-30 seconds apart seen travelling North to South, slightly Southwest.  Night was clear, other planes and their lights clearly visible.  Altitude I would best describe as about double the height of a standard helicopter flight altitude.  Much too high for any helicopter and I am sure I would make out the lights if it were a conventional aircraft as it was much lower than the other 3-4 planes visible in the sky in different regions. The other planes lights were very clearly distinguished.  There was definitely no blinking pattern, but rather a pulsing - very similar to how fire behaves - no pattern and no pauses like a conventional aircraft, just different intensities. In both cases the shape could not be determined other than oval and the lighting had a glow circumference I would estimate to be about the same as the crafts radius. Flight path was steady and straight.  Both craft had the exact same heading.  Both craft were identical.  Speed w! as nothing out of the ordinary that I could distinguish from other traffic.  I was able to really study the lights as they did not speed away too quickly.  Both slowly dimmed then vanished completely as they approached my nine o'clock direction (I was originally facing due north, 12 o'clock where I saw them approach from my 11 o'clock). The size was a bit hard to judge.  At first glance I swore it was a helicopter but it was just too high.  I have never seen a helicopter fly that high, especially so close to 2 different airports (one commercial, the other for private flying). But the size could come close to that of a helicopter if it were that high. No distinct sounds heard - too much background noise to hear any plane. I am used to aircraft sightings as we are near 2 airports. We see all varieties of aircraft both civilian, commercial, and military.  Occupation is Quality Analyst at a local engineering company.

3 fireballs flying silently and slowly across sky;2013-05-16 21:00:00;2 minutes;3 fireballs flying silently and slowly across sky 3 fireballs seen flying low moving slowly across the sky.   They maintained equal distance apart from the other and maintained the same speed.  They appeared to flicker similar to candle light.   They seemed to change direction and fly away from us until they disappeared.  We heard no noise.  My husband is a believer and I on the other hand was not until I witnessed this.

Two orange fireballs across they sky in St. Peters.;2013-07-03 21:45:00;2-3 minutes;Two orange fireballs accross they sky in St. Peters Around 9:45 pm we were watching fireworks from our deck.   We saw two orange fireball type objects come across the horizon going from the south to the north.  They were traveling at the same speed and were visible for 2-3 minutes.   They were traveling at about the same speed as a plane but it looked like an orange fireball.   About the time they were over highway 70 the disappeared.   The one flying on the west side disappeared first, then the 2nd one disappeared about 10 seconds later.   No sound was heard from the objects.;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063

Was driving down highway 94 south I happend to look up to the south and seen these glowing lughts in the southern sky.  So I pulled over to try to get a better look at them. When doing so I noticed them changing positions several times.  Tried to capture a photo but the street lights where to bright. So we got back into the car and tried to move to a darker location.  By the time we where able to do this they where there for about 10 seconds and then they where gone.  I have been looking into ufos for quite sometime but have never seen anything before now.  As for my wife she has never believed in anything like this and she still can't seem to grasp what we really seen.;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063

Firey UFO over Unincorporated Saint Peters;2021-01-08 20:30:00;1 minute;Firey UFO over Unincorporated Saint Peters I was standing outside my home in Saint Peters and was disturbed by the entirety of my immediate surroundings being lit from above.  What I saw above was definitely fire-y, and it gave the same sort of impression when it lit the ground and house below and behind me.  It WAS CLOSE.  The sky is overcast tonight and it was between me and the clouds.  It swept over my house from the east and down toward the west.  It was most certainly aflame, and glowed a yellowish orange color and moved incredibly fast. It felt so close that I thought that it certainly had crashed into the neighborhood behind my house, but when I followed it back into the subdivision I found nothing.  There was no sound that I can remember. but I do remember feeling a rush of wind.  There were a black sedan on my street corner stopped at the time, though I did not manage to talk to the people inside.;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
