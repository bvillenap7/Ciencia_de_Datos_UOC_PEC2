Midway through the show, I heard a very loud, low and mellow hum coming from outside, almost reverberating the walls.  I peeked through the blinds and didn't see anything, although the grumbling noise continued. Quickly, I went outside to check if it was a train or a plane but this was louder.  Directly above, nothing could be seen until for a brief 5 seconds, 3 white lights flashed, almost fluctuating.  They were arranged in a perfect equilateral triangle, moving at a very slow pace.   This craft seemed to be cloaked by some light optics camouflauge or something military in nature.  I was both amazed and terrified at once.  My ears rang, like acoustical dissonance between two destructive frequencues.  I got dizzy at went inside.   A teacher said he saw a triangle floating above Dierbergs late at night.  My sighting was blinking and fuzzy.   I have one mutual witness of a similar sighting, my teacher.  This is the second time it's happened.  It's always very early in the AM.

Tbought of these to be ufo since I have seen them before.  When I had looked behind me down the road in the sky was a huge bright glow.  It slowly flew towards me to eventually fly slowly over my next door neighor roof next to me.  My back deck is almost level to their roof. This object was a triangular shape with white bright lights around the shape on the bottom of it. It was silver also and absolutely breathe taking.  It flew off silently to disappear into the sky. I went to get my fiance and the light had started again from the original point.  Again it flew by and he then saw it.   Ever since then ever night I go out to smoke a cigarette I see this ship. It always come out of nowhere.;38.7829999999993;-90.6351000000063
