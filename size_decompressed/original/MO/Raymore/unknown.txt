(like a paint sprayer) the scan would only last 2 or 3 seconds. it would scan 3 or 4 times before it past over my house. i woke my roomate, there was nothing  two nights later, there is a star in the east south east(about 2 o'clock) sky with a red and blue hue and this star wiggles up and down for about three hours thats my story and im stickin to it ron;38.8024;-94.4537
Football stadium lighted craft spotting at night in Cass County Missour,i but not confirmed.;2013-11-06 19:00:00;15 minutes;Football stadium lighted craft spotting at night in Cass County, Missouri, but not confirmed. Seen unknown craft at night time it was hard to see cause I was driving on 291 highway from Harrisonville Missouri.   Spotted it hovering above 58 highway along Raymore area going east towards Pleasant Hill Missouri and last saw it above 7 highway in Pleasant Hill as I was going home from work.   It had about 8 to 10 football stadium like lights on it.  It could have been some kind of military exercise aircraft like an Osprey or law enforcement but hard to tell from it being dark out and kept driving.;38.8024;-94.4537
