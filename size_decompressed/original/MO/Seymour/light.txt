Low flying, slow moving 5 lights, perfectly spaced at all times,  Dissipated one by one.;2013-10-05 20:25:00;1 minute;Low flying, Slow moving.  5 lights, perfectly spaced at all times,  Dissapated one by one. There were three of us driving into the town of Seymour Mo. It had been an overcast and rainy and stars were not visible.  We were East bound going into town.   At first I thought the lights were radio towers that I had never noticed before and I asked my passenger about them.  At the same time she had noticed them as well and then we noticed the lights were moving.  From a distance they were three times the height of a radio tower and about 2.5 football fields in length from the first light to the last light.  They were all moving at a very slow speed and the spacing between the lights never changed.  This leads me to believe they were all part of one object (huge) or they were able to stay in sync perfectly.  We pulled over to observe them and watched as the lights slowly dissipated one by one.  The whole event lasted about one minute from the time we noticed them coming up on a very busy intersection of Hwy 60 and the Seymour exit by Casey's Gas Station.
