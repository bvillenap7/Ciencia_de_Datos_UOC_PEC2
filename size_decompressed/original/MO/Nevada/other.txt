The object I saw was a very bright neon green colored object that appeared to be relatively low in the sky.  I wasn't even looking in the sky, but the brightness of it caught my attention in the Northern sky and while it was in my sight, only lasted about 3 seconds.  It rocketed across the sky traveling from East to West for a short distance then simply disappeared.  In describing it's size, if I held up my hands a foot apart looking toward the sky, that's how long it was.  Using the same method for width, my hands would be about 4 inches apart.  There was no noticeable sound.  The night was partly cloudy, however, the object appeared in front of the clouds and the point at which it disappeared would have been where the sky cleared, but it disappeared as well.  I called to my husband, who was in the barn, but he did not get out in time to see it.  We live in the country, about 3 miles outside of town so there would not have been any city lights interfering. It made the hair on my neck stand up because, with the recent attacks on our country, I thought it was a missile and it truly scared me.  We observed the sky a few minutes longer, but saw nothing else.  My husband and I are local business owners.;37.8394;-94.3594
