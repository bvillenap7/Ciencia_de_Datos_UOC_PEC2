Many stars where visable and after perhaps an hour...probably more, 3 of the brighter stars directly above us, I would guess 20 degrees left to right began to move at a high rate of speed (guessing twice the speed of an airliner at 35.000 ft.) and at different intervals each starlight would make sharp 90 degree turns without slowing down.  This really caught our attention as we didn't believe any jet could do this. This went on for possibly 10 minutes and then just seemed to disappear as if fading away.  Later the same night, guessing 1 hr. later we were discussing how bright this particular star was, and how it didn't seem to moving with the passing of time.  Several minutes later, to our astonishment, this star began getting bigger and within a few seconds was guessed to be about half the size of the moon, as if it were falling on us.  Needless to say, all 3 of us sat up at the same time in disbelief.  At this moment a large cloud passed between us and  the star.  I said to the others, Did you see the same thing I did, and everyone described it the same way.  Of coarse, this was an exciting moment.  Nothing else was seen this night, but I will always remember the experience.  This was so long ago that I'm not certain about the exact date, but I can tell you the rest is ever so true.  It was as if the stars were a disguise for whatever it was we saw. We heard no sound. We were at the Isaac Walton Lake in Nevada, MO. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.8394;-94.3594
Strange stationary light. Increased in brightness, became faint, moved to the right, and vanished.  ((NUFORC Note:  Iridium flare.  PD;2006-11-17 19:00:00;About 30 seconds;Strange stationary light. Increased in brightness, became faint, moved to the right, and vanished. I work at a steak house about 2 miles outside the city limits of Nevada, MO. We had just finished our dinner rush and I was able to slip out the back door for a quick break. I immediately noticed a bright star  high in the Southern sky. Nevada, MO is a small rural community. Not much interference with town lights and the night's sky. The sky was dark and clear. As I began observing this object, I quickly realized it was becoming brighter...It was white, but baby blue in color as it increased in brightness. This object was very very bright in contrast to the stars in the sky and much larger, however it appeared to be a star.   It was very high in the sky and was stationary.  It hadn't moved once. The object became very bright and then gradually decreased in brightness.  It eventually turned into a small ball of light.  The object at this point was very faint. It then moved to the right(west) (first sign of movement) and then disappeared.  The whole incident lasted for about 30 seconds.  It frightened me. I ran inside and told my manager about it. (Extra Info) I am an Astronomy buff and I view the night sky regularly. I know the difference between a plane, a helicopter, a falling star, a satellite, etc.  I’m not sure what it was…but I can say with certainty that it wasn’t any of these things. I’ve never seen anything like it before. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses observed the flare from Iridium #84.

Ball of light bouncing around outside of Nevada, MO, I have a video.;2007-01-05 02:00:00;all night;Ball of light bouncing around outside of Nevada, MO, I have a video. I was sitting camping by a lake in Nevada. What I saw was a ball of light near the ground just jumping all around. There was also another that would go above these trees and then just dart down below the trees as a search light passed by it. The search light was apart of the airport. Everytime this light passed the UFO darted around. The other light that was behind us was the real weird one. I accually have a video of it on my Phone. These lights stayed all evening and when dawn broke the darted off towards the east. The shape was just a ball of light. A circle that was as bright as a star. This was the wierdest thing I have seen. The object I saw was on the ground not landed but just hoovering over the ground the light just kept getting closer and closer so we backed off of it and waited till it left.;37.8394;-94.3594
fast moving blinking light in sky, could stop and move briskly again in a matter of seconds;2007-02-28 21:00:00;20 minutes;fast moving blinking light in sky, could stop and move briskly again in a matter of seconds I was laying outside with a friend of mine. We were watching the stars and just talking about life in general when all of a sudden we saw something moving. At first we thought it was maybe a star twinkling or even an airplane until it shot off. The object was no larger than any of the stars and looked no different other than it seemed to be blinking. We laid there in complete awe at its ability to dart in any direction, stop, and then continue to move rapidly throughout the atmosphere. It seemed to only stay in a small area of the sky rather than move around to many different corners of what was visible. We watched it for probably twenty minutes until it seemed to just disappear. We couldn’t find it in the sky anywhere.;37.8394;-94.3594
Silent light craft moves across sky with steady brightness until it vanishes into thin air in 2 secs.;2013-07-15 23:30:00;10 seconds;Silent light craft moves across sky with steady brightness until it vanishes into thin air in 2 secs. I was texting when I looked up and seen a VERY bright light coming across the sky.  I watched it a few seconds as it silently came across the sky from the North heading Southeast, it's light steady...never blinking.  I thought it was strange so I quickly finished my text and looked up.  A couple seconds after looking up it got dimmer, and within 2 secs, literally, it was completely gone....vanishing into thin air.;37.8394;-94.3594
