I was in my vehicle in the country waiting on some friends and had just gotten off of work.    After I heard the men speaking I looked up and saw a cylendrical craft with multiple rows of colored lights descend upon my vehicle and hover for about five minutes before ascending back in the sky and shooting off in a westerly direction.    I never saw the men who were talking and I started my car and got out of there before they could find me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Round Orb in night sky flares to 50 times its size caught on video;2015-04-26 21:18:00;2:00;Round Orb in night sky flares to 50 times its size caught on video. I was watching the night sky with my night vision camera with me.  A round white object came into view, so I got it in frame and tracked it for a minute or two.  A few seconds after I got it in frame, it started to flare, getting much bigger in size.  It got approximately 50 times bigger than its original size, but only momentarily.   I posted the video here: (It's #4):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8kX7hUTWaM;37.3044837586996;-89.5205481051793

The object was silver and shiny.  I immediately went to Flightradar24 to check for other planes in the area.  I snapshot it to document no other planes were in the area, within 50 miles, and certainly none traveling in that direction within more than a hundred miles. I then went to Google Earth to get a point in space reference of the angle and position of the anomaly and estimated that it would have been approximately 11 kilometers or approximately 36000 feet above the ground.   The weather was clear and sunny, no clouds present, and the object seemed to disappear right before my eyes within 15 seconds of first seening it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  That fact, combined with his employment background and military service, suggest to us that he is an excellent, and reliable, witness.  PD));37.3044837586996;-89.5205481051793
