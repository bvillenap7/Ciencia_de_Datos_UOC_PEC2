3 Multi-colored possibly diamond shaped UFOs;2012-07-31 23:15:00;23:45;3 Multi-colored possibly diamond shaped UFOs My mother and I observed 3 objects in the sky which appeared to be stationary at a high altitude.   Each had a single bright white pulsing light with what appeared to be red and green smaller strobes circling the brighter white light.  We initially thought the object were planes but then observed erratic zig-zag movements.   I have high powered 1watt blue laser pointer which I aimed at the closest object.  When u did this the object would instantly jump away from the beam in a manor of I have never observed any aircraft move.  We continued to watch the object for nearly 30 minutes until 2 of them disappeared from sight.  The 3rd continued to maintain its general location moving effortlessly in a zig - zag motion.   Neither of us ever heard any sounds from the objects.  At 2345 hours we stopped watching the object and went in the house.;37.3044837586996;-89.5205481051793
