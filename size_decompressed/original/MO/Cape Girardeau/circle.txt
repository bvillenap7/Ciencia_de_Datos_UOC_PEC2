Circular object appears to float over city;2002-01-26 21:45:00;1 minute;Circular object appears to float over city I observed a circular object travelling southbound approximately 400 feet in altitude and no more than 30 MPH. The object appeared to float and made no noise. The object was approximately 50 feet in diameter and white or a shiney color which reflected light from below.  The object was not displaying its own lights and could only be seen from the reflection of lights below.  I aimed a hand-held radar at the object, but did not receive a reading.  A report of the incident was reported to the UFO Center by telephone following the event. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual, and found him to be exceptionally credible.  He appeared on the Jeff Rense Radio Program on 12FE02, an archived copy of which probably is available at the <www.Rense.com> website.  PD));37.3044837586996;-89.5205481051793
