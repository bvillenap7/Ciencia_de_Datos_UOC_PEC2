A female student I knew lived in an apartment house (west side of the street) across the street from mine. She and I went through the hall of her apartment building to a second floor porch.  We stood out there for about 20 minutes looking at a silver disk-shaped craft which was hovering just above treeline to the south-southwest of the porch.  It had multicolor lights which were blinking at a slow rate from left to right, like a movie marquee.  The lights were approximately around the horizontal middle of the craft. When a small airplane approached from the north and got within a couple of miles, the lights on the UFO blinked very rapidly from left to right, then the whole craft disappeared.  This happened during the early evening and it was completely light outside.  It was difficult to judge distance or size, but my fist held at arms length would maybe have covered it, and my finger would not.  I think it was a block or two away.  The woman acquaintance was a student about 20 years old.  I was a biology student and worked at a local hospital as a nurse's aide.  I am now a registered nurse.;37.3044837586996;-89.5205481051793
