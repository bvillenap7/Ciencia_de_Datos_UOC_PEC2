Strange orbs seen in Cape Girardeau skys.;2018-11-03 19:45:00;10 minutes;Strange orbs seen in Cape Girardeau skys. On Nov 3rd, 2018, at approx. 7:45 PM in Cape Girardeau, MO, I had just taken my dog out, in my back yard and witnessed 5 Orange shaped Orbs in shape of a triangle appear traveling from the South and proceed to the Northwest.  A few seconds later I witnessed another single orange orb travel same direction, then a few seconds another, then another single, total of four.  I timed them about 12 seconds from appearance until disappeared.  These where no meteors.  I am a retiree of the US Air Force and worked security around aircraft, these where no meteors.  However, we did have the President visit here a few days later and is possible was a recon team but I never seen anything like it being Orange and was reported on KFVS TV.  Perhaps the airport in Cape Girardeau would have more information.  It was unlike anything I ever saw.;37.3044837586996;-89.5205481051793
