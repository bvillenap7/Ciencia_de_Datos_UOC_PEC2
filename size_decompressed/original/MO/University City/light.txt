My wife had just pulled into our driveway and come inside the house. She was looking out the back door and called me over, she told me to look in the trees to see if I noticed anything. I did. There were many flashing lights almost like fireflies, but more akin to a camera flash. They were in two trees behind my house and one tree in front of my house. One of the lights moved out of the tree and flashed slightly larger than the rest maybe the size of a baseball. I have video of the even, however my phone does not do it justice, some of the lights I called out in the video actually didnâ€™t show up in the recording or showed up as black dots instead of flashes. We were both 100% sober and sure these were not fireflies. The light was much more electric and white like a camera flash or led. We came inside and both got goosebumps over our entire bodies and felt freezing cold and drained, it was 75 degrees out. These were most definitely not a solid craft, but some! sort of electrical entity/entities.;38.6559;-90.3093
