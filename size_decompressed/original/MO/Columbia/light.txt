Object was distinctly seen from 2 blocks as it passed over 5-7 blocks of the campus (Quadrangle to Red Square to courtyard behind Student Union).  When the object was exactly due south of us,l it stopped as if aware it was being watched, paused for 2 seconds and then closed in on itself.  What I mean by that is that the outer diameter of the object reduced within a second from the size of a Ford Pinto to zero, ie nothing, ie it no longer existed. ZERO sound.  Local FAA called & reported no radar objects.  Local weather station and University Meteroligical program called, & they both confirmed that NO experiments had been scheduled.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

Noticed a lighted shape plowing through light cloud cover.;1999-05-22 21:15:00;Approx.1M;Noticed a lighted shape plowing through light cloud cover. Took dog for a ride. Stopped on road at Hwy 70 and Bernadette Dr. to look at sky. Facing northeast. Noticed what seemed to be a small whitish cloud captured in a light cloud cover hanging over Columbia. (Stars were visible through clouds.) Then noticed that the little cloud was moving to the north. At first it just looked like a cloud moving through the sky. But as it moved it kept its cambre. It looked like a ship plowing water the front was raised. AS it got a little closer to us I could see that there was a more brightly lit area at the front. The general appearance was oval.  There was a bright area, a point of light at the front, followed by a lighter area which trailed off in a tail which lengthened and shortened (dissipated) as it moved. The speed seemed constant.  (The body/oval was about 1 inch at arms length and the tail as long as three inches.)  We watched it for about a minute till it moved off to the north.  It was low eneough that it seemed to be reflecting the lights from Columbia Mall. As it moved north and away from the lights the cloud no longer reflected the light, subsequently we lost sight of it. Planes were easily visible as were the stars and planets.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

I saw three lights that looked like running lights for some blacked out shape. It occurred at night so the shape was not visible. There are several large groups of trees in the area although the object rode off in the distance. It was very low when I first saw it above my window and moved much faster than any plane or helicopter. It made no sound. It buzzed my neighborhood moved to hover above some trees which I am guessing to be about 400 yards away. After a while it went off into the treeline and dissapeared out of sight.

Travelling northbound on Highway 63 at northern Columbia (Missouri) city limits, there was a light like a star in the northwest night sky at about 35-40 degrees elevation moving quickly downward from right to left.  Trailing from the light was what appeared to be sparks or dots of light floating away behind the light. There were approximately 4-6 total forming and streaming behind.  As the light descended for what may be 3-5 seconds, the light and the trailing tail of lights coming from it disappeared.  It appeared much like what we were told as kids what a shooting star looks like.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

We all wondered what it was, it being 11:30 at night, and went outside the tent to see what was making the noise.  The object appeared to be a jet untill it came close to us. There were many lights on the base of the object, seemed to be in a circle.  Flying very very low, much lower than conventional aircraft. It hovered over our heads and indeed it was a sphere shaped object with a circle of lights on the bottom, moved very slowly just right of where we were standing.  Just as soon as it was out of sight the noise ceased.  Luckily one of us had brought a video camera just in case anyone did something funny, and the whole sighting was caught on video.  I cant find out how to get it onto the computer though.  A very thrilling experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

A bright object was seen moving across the sky, north to south.;2007-07-13 21:40:00;2 min;We were sitting at an outdoor table, looking East, and  counting the Stars and Planets as they came out. Venus(?) was at 1:30 with another  planet below it to the right. A star was at 11:00 and some below it. I counted a total 8 objects in the sky at this time. A bright object was seen moving across the sky, north to south. Roy went in to get binoculars for me, at about Venus it turned around and came back, South to North-NE. I was able to see it with the binoculars as it passed the star at 11:00. It was a steady bright light, not flashing. It was very high in the sky. At this time 2 airplanes came from the North, lights flashing and turned East. One was close behind the other. This gave me an opportunity to judge the speed of the UFO.  I do not know, but I would guess it was moving 10-20 times faster. I looked like a big meteor, but had no tail. Did anyone else see this object??;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
Three stars / lights moving around the early morning sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of star??  PD));2009-04-21 05:30:00;1 hour;Three stars / lights moving around the early morning sky. Dear NUFORC At 05:30hrs on the 21st of April 2009 my wife woke me to verify what she was seeing. We live in Columbia, MO, and not knowing what would be the proper method of describing where, what, and when I’ll do my best.  We saw what looked like a star that was moving back and forth almost directly above our location. While watching that star another light appeared just north and west of the first star moving south to north.  It covered a distance of 45 degrees and then blinked out.   Not long after that another star appeared south east of the first star and moved from east to west for about 45 degrees and then blink out.   Meanwhile the first star was still moving back and forth and my wife said that she could see a glow around it every now and then that resembled the northern lights.  We kept watching the star till sunup where it faded out. I’ve seen satellites and these star / lights moved in a manner that a satellite could not possibly do as well as the speed that they where moving.  The second and third lights covered the distance mentioned above in less than 10 seconds. We went out the next night and did not spot the stars.   I forgot to mention that our youngest son came out and watched the stars with us for a while.   We’ll keep an eye out for any more UFO’s and will keep in touch.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

The aircraft was silent and it flew away from me like it was leaving the earth's atmosphere. I have never seen anything like this and it was definately not an airplane, helicopter, or shooting star.

To the south west, over columbia I saw 6 or seven bright lights (brighter than stars) in a kind of formation being equally spaced apart with the lead light would one at a time peel off and swoop towards the ground as hang gliders or parachutes might do.  They all seemed to be slowly drifting downward. After 15 to 30 seconds they went behind the tree line and were not visable after that. The time was about 6:30 pm dst.  At no time did thet make any eratic movements but drift downward with the one in the lead peeling off kind of swooping down towards the ground, (I saw 2 or three do this swooping motion before they went behind the tree line.)  I did not have a cb radio to ask if anyone else saw this but it was plain to see for anyone driving through the area.  I googled lights in the sky over columbia, MO 11/17/12, and sure enough there is a you tube video of the last few seconds of what I saw.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

Couldn't get back to sleep so got up and went to the kitchen and poured a glass of milk.   While looking aimlessly out of the kitchen window I noticed a very bright silver/white round light about the size of a pea at arm's length moving across my field of view (North) and traveling West.   As I watched, it paused for maybe 3 seconds, (thus eliminating the possibility of any aircraft) and then continued on its path.   I did not see where it went because trees hampered my view.  It appeared to be about 25 degrees above the horizon and checking Google Maps, maybe 400 feet from my home.   This is a semi rural area and the closest airport is Columbia Regional about 6 miles southeast.  Regional is closed at night. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was mine.

If you are in Missouri please contact me at ufomig@yahoo.com to discuss any possible sightings you might have now or in the past.  Of course, always file a report at the UFOCENTER.COM. The fireworks display in downtown Columbia, Mo. ended around 9:35PM and we started home over Stadium Blvd.  Turning west on Broadway my husband, Greg, who was driving, and I noticed a bright red light in the western sky moving north toward Venus and Jupiter. We watched for a few seconds and it appeared to be an airplane so we lost interest.  We then turned north onto Silvey Rd..  Silvey turns into a very steep hill before it reaches I-70 Drive SW. (http://tinyurl.com/p7qbuzc).  When you are at the top of the descent, visually, you are almost directly across from the tops of the trees on the other side of I-70 Drive SW.   It was at this time we saw a large, fire engine red object, a little smaller than a dime at arm’s length, just above the tops of the trees.  It appeared round, with a little “haze” circling the perimeter which could be attributable to the smoke from neighborhood firework displays.  I lowered my window but did not hear any sound other than our car.   As we descended the! hill, the object was still visible but was somewhat obscured by the trees.  My husband turned west onto I-70 Drive SW and we attempted to keep it in view but couldn’t. We crossed Sorrel’s Overpass (a road over Highway 70) and turned west onto I-70 Drive NW then north on Gibbs Rd. and then east hoping to get another view from a highpoint overlooking a forested area which was once a Christmas tree farm but we had lost it.  This object appeared very close to us, between I-70Drive SW (38.966995, -92.389620) and W. Gibbs Rd. (38.973707, -92.389698) but that is purely a guess.  (Use Google Maps for coordinates.)   In retrospect I wonder if the light we originally saw while driving over Broadway was really a plane.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

A streak of light made a crack in the evening sky as my wife and I sat on the porch enjoying the warm fall night.  We both looked at each other in awe. She mentioned Chem trail in sarcasm and says, At least we are on the right side, as a black line appears on the bottom side of the white line. I ask her, Why do you think that?  She tells me that it looked as if the cloud was elevating up, and then another black line appeared on top of the white. These lines were appearing fairly low in the southern sky, just above the tree lines over Columbia.  Suddenly the black line on the bottom began to melt or droop.   This was very eerie. I went inside to get my phone to use the camera on it, but as I'm inside, my wife hollers to me.  When I go back outside she says it's gone.  I look up and there is no trace of it.  There were some jet trail clouds (2-3) going in the opposite direction.  They looked nothing like what we had just witnessed. It was like the sky had cracked  opened, then bled out and healed itself in just mere minutes.  Weird!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Object moved very slowly with flashes/beams of light irregular in frequency emitting from it.  ((anonymous report));2016-12-27 21:15:00;10-15 minutes;Object moved very slowly with flashes/beams of light irregular in frequency emitting from it. At approximately 21:15 pm central standard time in Columbia, MO, my spouse and I were on our back deck looking towards the south while smoking.  I noticed a strange flash of white light towards the southwest part of the sky and began watching for it again.  It flashed again around 10 seconds later but flashed in an irregular way now in a blue and red beam of movement like a very slow motion trail.  It continued to flash mostly either faint or extremely bright flashes of white light with no pattern or rhythm of flashing, and once in a blue moon it had the flash of blue and red again similar to a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere but in a more controlled way.  It inched slowly across the sky from west to east in a horizontal direction until disappearing behind the trees. It moved much too slow to be an airplane, satellite, or the ISS.  It was clearly in the sky and not out in space, and guessing roughly it was probably 5-10,000 feet off the ground perhaps a 1/2 a mile to a mile from our location.  In about 15-20 minutes it had moved so slowly that it only covered about 10 feet of the sky from our point of view.  Any passenger or military plane or helicopters I've seen here would cover that distance in under 20 seconds.  The B-2s fly out here quite often too with Whiteman AFB being so close.  Definitely wasn't that and didn't sound like the B-2.  This object had no sound whatsoever. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

It was a constant white light that did not flicker or distort in any way, and was about twice the size of the nearby stars.
