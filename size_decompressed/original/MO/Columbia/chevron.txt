I was sitting on the backporch, looking at the sky, smoking a cigarette when an orange light in the sky caught my attention. At first I thought it was a comet or meteor, even a plane crashing. I called to my roommate to come outside and look. She thought it might be a flock of geese. Then we got a good look at it, but we both saw it differently. I saw a boomerang shaped obect, the struture glowing orange with two round white lights at the tip of each end and no light at the front. She saw it as a series of orange lights defining the shape as a boomerang. She did not see the white lights. The first time we saw it, it was very high in the sky, it came from the south and flew east. When I first saw it, it was moving very slowly, then it darted behind trees to the east. We both lost sight of it. Then it reappeared maybe 1-3 minutes later.  We don't know for sure what direction it came from the second time, it was just there. It appeared to be closer and larger the second time. It also appeared to be going back in the same direction it came from. We dont remember what happened to it, where it went the second time, it seemed to dissappear, but it could have been obscured by the light haze in the distance.  After we lost sight of it, a flock of geese did fly by and we could compare the object and its movemnet to the geese. It was definately not geese! We did not hear any sound either time. We are both students at the University of Missouri, Columbia. (Uploaded by investigator);38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
