Was sitting outside my door smoking a cigarette and seen something that apeared to be a star, I seen it move from the corner of my eye, afterwords I stared at it and it moved very slowly to the right getting smaller and smaller as if it was going out of site towards outter space. Stared at it till I seen nothing at all. Not saying this is infact a UFO.. im just stating this is my opinion.. it is a Unidentfied Object to myself. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting may have been caused by the flare from an Iridium satellite, but that can be confirmed at <www.heavens-above.com>.  PD));38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

Insatntly the point of the triangle jumped several miles ahead. That left them in a straight line. Then the one that would now be in the center completely disappeared right before my eyes. The other two slowly drifted out of sight.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
John from Columbia, MO  While on my way home from a little league baseball game on 10-3-07, my fiancée and I witnessed a UFO.  While tr;2007-10-03 20:40:00;3 minutes;((name deleted)) from Columbia, MO.   While on my way home from a little league baseball game on 10-3-07, my fiancée and I witnessed a UFO.  While traveling north on Scott Blvd., my S.O. pointed to the 4:00 position, as viewed through the front windshield and said, “Is that a UFO.”  It seemed to be approximately ¼ mile or less from our position and moving very slowly (drifting) to the west, very low, less than a 1000 ft. altitude.   I have been an aviation buff my entire life and have observed anything that flies at one time or another in all types of conditions.  This was close and strange, no sound, appeared spherical (i.e. best guess 60 – 80 ft. diameter), flat metal or gray color and four small lights, my S.O. reported that the lights changed at one point, however, they all appeared red to me, which was my first clue that this was something odd (i.e. not standard aircraft lights.)   I attempted to follow the craft, as I was in somewhat in shock, I was actually looking at something I couldn’t ID.  I attempted to follow it as it drifted west, I turned off of Scott into a neighborhood trying to follow it, but it eventually drifted behind a tree line.  I then thought I would try to get on highway 70 west in hopes of seeing the object out in the open, however, it took a few minutes to get to 70 and it was just gone.    My fiancée previously adamantly disbelieved in the possibility of UFO’s, in fact she made fun of my interest frequently.  However, as I was driving and trying not to wreck the car, she got a better look than I did and couldn’t deny what she saw, she was actually sick after the event and somewhat in shock.  We were both sick, as we couldn’t believe what just happened.   Extensive vehicle traffic was present, I expected people to be parked and watching the object, however, the traffic just kept flowing.  Other people had to have seen this, we just don’t want to ask anyone because we both work in a professional field.  I know I saw something I couldn’t ID, I want to know if other people saw it.  Even though we both saw it, both of us have some fear that we are crazy, neither of us slept last night, things were just strange.  I always had hoped I would see a UFO,  but driving home from a baseball game, in the middle of traffic and in a populated area, it caught us completely off guard.  I desperately want to talk to someone about it, we both still feel a little sick.   As the event happened last night and I missed part of the local news, I don’t know if it is in the Columbia News or paper, I will monitor throughout the day. Additional note:   Before the event I was at a little league baseball game on Scott Blvd., a mile or so from our UFO event.  At 5:50p.m. approximately, a C130 flew over the field fairly low, maybe 3000 ft. or less.  My S.O. asked me to ID the plane, I told her, she said , “why is a military plane flying so low.”  I didn’t think it was anything strange until after the event she mentioned the C130 again, might be nothing, but just wanted to include.  Also, as I was driving, frantic, trying to watch the UFO, it’s possible my directions are off, but I did review a map of the area after the event and I do believe the UFO was drifting to the west. My phone # is 573-((number deleted)), if someone wants to talk to me, please don’t release my phone number to anyone else, thanks.   Also I tried to send this same message earlier, don't know if if went through, as I have an old computer, also may have used the wrong month, it was last night, 10-3-07.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

I stopped to take some pictures of the clouds and the sunset.   As I was taking a picture, I noticed a yellow circular shape moving through the trees.  I was taking a panoramic picture as it was moving and then it abruptly stopped, seemingly  to hover in the trees.   I continued to take the panoramic picture, and as I was getting ready to stop the photo, I saw through my screen display, the object shoot through the trees, and then shooting into the sky.  I photographed the circular object hovering in the trees, as well as it entering the clouds in one panoramic photo. z object did not leave any type of vapor trail that I could see, it moved so fast that I was able to catch it in one short panoramic photo.  Both as it hovered, as well as it in the clouds.  The object had tree branches in front of it, and it blocked seeing tree branches behind it.  Also, the object is also seen with part of the cloud in front of it, and it's blotting out the dark clouds behind it. I cannot really determine the size of the object, may be six to eight feet in diameter.  It was  A bright yellow or white in color, it seemed like it was flashing.  I tried to duplicate the same picture, but there were no objects in following pictures taken.  This helped me conclude that this was not a dirty lens on my camera or a raindrop. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) As an ex professional photographer, I know that it was not a camera flare, especially with a non smart phone and in a car with tinted windows. The object was on the left side of the road hovering in a rainbow then went over the road to the rain cloud and that's when I got the picture of it.

She said that my dad had seen something before it went into the trees around 11:24AM.  He'd gone back into to get some binoculars, while my mom and I were left to find what he had seen in the sky. When my eyes came upon it, it appeared in intervals between blue sky and the craft, it seemed to flash.  At the time of day it seemed impossible for there to be flashing lights on an object near to the height of the day.  The object seemed to give off a coppery, or bronze, appearance from our distance it flew at the altitude ofor maybe a mile or a mile and a half.  Upon being handed the binoculars to see it better, it hardly seemed to help, but I managed to clarify the view. The object was round, I claimed it had an odd light-bulb shape, as it seemed bigger on top than the bottom.  My dad claimed it some  It also seemed to flash or reflect in the sunlight, though it only kept in a straight line moving from North West to South West.  It remained its coppery, or bronze, color through the time we saw it until our view was obscured by trees.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
