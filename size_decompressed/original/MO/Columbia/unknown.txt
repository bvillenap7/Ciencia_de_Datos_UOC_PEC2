MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP REPORT:  While driving to work this morning we saw an unusual object in the skyâ€¦;2000-02-09 08:25:00;1 minute;While driving to work this morning we saw an unusual object in the sky... My husband jokingly commented about all the vapor trails in the sky. As we looked up we both noticed a silver/reflective object in proximity to an airplane we had been watching. The plane was obviously moving to the west and leaving a big billowy trail, while the object to its north seemed stationary in relationship to the plane and did not have a trail. I pulled to the side of the road and we watched. The plane moved on but the silver object seemed to not be moving. Then a little wisp of cloud passed in front of it. We waited to see if it would reappear, but it did not and the cloud floated on. The sky was basically clear and bright blue. There is no way to tell how big the object was, but it seemed to be close to the same size as the plane. the plane.

Stationary lights suddenly moved rapidly stopped, moved again at a moderate pace;2002-01-21 22:30:00;1 - 3 minutes;Stationary lights suddenly moved rapidly stopped, moved again at a moderate pace From our car, we saw two bright, non-moving, non-blinking lights high in the night sky.  As we both focused on the object, it suddenly jetted to the Southwest in amazing speed for a second or so.  It stopped momentarily, then continued to move Southwest in a moderate speed.  We quit watching after a couple of minutes.  We are a middle-aged mom and a 14 year old son.  He has seen other objects in the past (not this same one) at about this same time, but Mom has never seen one.  She is now a believer!;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
Blue and Green lights in Night Sky;2005-11-01 19:40:00;3 to 4 seconds;Blue and Green lights in Night Sky I am a 41 year old married male, professionally employed.  The event took place while returning home from dropping my 12 year old son off with his mother for an out of town trip.  My wife was with me in the car, but she didn't see what I saw as she had been watching for deer on the road (it was well after dark at the time).  As I was driving south on Hwy 63, approaching a turn off onto Hwy 124, approximately 12 miles N of Columbia, MO, I happened to notice in the sky a grouping of blue and green lights.  The lights were moving very fast, east to west and only remained visible for a few seconds.  My first thought was that of a shooting star, but there was no tail to these lights.  The grouping of lights were either triangular or rectangular in shape and when it ended, the lights seem to just shut off, rather than fade or diminish in intensity.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
A strange piece of metal fell out of my daughters ear!  ((NUFORC Note:  Missouri Investigator Group investigates medical device.  PD));2006-03-17 21:00:00;5min;A strange piece of metal fell out of my daughters ear!u My kids and I were getting ready to do some reading before bed.My 8year old daughter was rubbing her ear with a tissiuewe noticed a small amount of bloodwhen a object fell out of her ear, we thought it was wax, but noticed some metal.We than looked and seen it was all metal,round with about 4 holes in it.It is about the size of the Okey on the key board. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Barb Becker, of Missouri Investigator Group, for following up on this case.  Ms. Becker determined that the metal object was a tiny medical device, inserted into the eardrum of the young girl, in order to equalize pressure between the atmosphere, and the middle ear.  PD)) ((REPORT FROM BARB BECKER, MISSOURI INVESTIGATOR GROUP,  http://ufomig.bravehost.com/index.html)) Hi Peter:   Met up with ((name deleted)). Got the piece of metal found in his childs ear.  After talking for awhile he told me she had had an ear infection and had a shunt put in. Well, I knew right then what it was.  Found this pic on the internet. The piece from the ear is the little round piece with the holes.   Can you imagine a doctor left that in her ear!    Anyway, case closed.  Thought you might like to know.     http://www.ghorayeb.com/files/PEtubesOnPenny.jpg   Barb ((END REPORT));38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP REPORT:  It was a cloudless night except for a round shape black cloud covering the moon.;2009-04-01 19:30:00;1 minute;MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP REPORT: The first time I saw one it was on new years day. It was a cloudless night except for a round shape black cloud covering the moon. It did not look like a cloud it looked like smoke. It held its shape and when it dissipated it stayed in one place. The second time was a whole different sighting. I was on my patio in back of the house and it was dusk, sun was below the horizon but still plenty of light. To the west I saw one again. It got darker and was not solid, like a round cloud but not like a cloud within the circle. It was not perfectly round. Sorta like a mortar firework puff. Anyway, it dissipated slowly in the same place. Then another one formed, got darker and looked the same as the first one. But then I saw a little black dot like like a pencil point travel from the cloud that was going away and where it stopped another one formed. It formed there then the dot moved and another one formed. When they dissipated it ! was over.There was a branch on the neighbors yard and a limb with leaves stuck out closely to the right of this happening and it all happened in exactly the same place. I searched the internet. I was about to give up seeing anything about this, then I saw a pic of one up close and it is amazing. Shows black strands, not straight, that were real black. Looks like they are like when u drain a bathtub and the little tornado like swirls around the main draining. I can find the website again and get the pic or u can find it too.

Driving west on Highway 70, saw two unidentifiable objects in sky.;2015-04-12 19:23:00;1 minute;Driving west on Highway 70, saw two unidentifiable objects in sky. Driving west over Highway 70. I just got a smartphone and had never used the camera so I decided to take a pic through the windshield...just goofing around.  I did not see the objects before taking the pic, but that doesn't mean they weren't visible, I just wasn't looking.  I saw them after I took the first pic and then took several more pictures.  I thought I was just recording dirt on the windshield but additional pics did not show the same marks.  The objects were traveling north.  I can not estimate size, speed or distance.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
The sky and the entire neighborhood lit up brighter than the daytime at 9:53PM in Columbia, MO in Sunrise Estates.;2015-11-04 21:53:00;10 seconds;The sky and the entire neighborhood lit up brighter than the daytime at 9:53PM in Columbia, MO, in Sunrise Estates I was outside in the backyard smoking a cigarette under the deck, and suddenly the entire yard and sky lit up brighter than the daytime for 3 whole seconds, so I ran out from under the deck to look up into the sky to see what caused the brightness, and I saw a very long, thick contrail in the sky not more than 100 feet above ground level that did not dissipate within the time that I watched it.  The contrail was slightly curving back and forth but not very much at all, meaning it was moderately straight-traveling.  The object that caused it was only visible for the millisecond before it disappeared, but it appeared to be on fire.   I freaked out and ran inside immediately.  The light was so bright that I thought the planet was either exploding or that we were being taken by the light into Heaven.  It was INTENSE!!!   My friend also told me just now on Facebook that he saw the same thing in Joplin, MO.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
