MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  Noticed something flying over highway.;2002-06-06 23:15:00;30 seconds;Noticed something flying over highway. Wrote it off as an airplane, because I knew there was an airport near by. As I neared, I saw that it was disc shaped and its movement was not similar to an airplane. No wings. It seemed to hover across at variable speeds. Next I noticed the lights, all white, one red. By this time I had passed it, and it was across the highway. ( I had also alerted my passenger) At this point I had to turn my head back to see it, as it came to a hault, and hovered up, down, and to the side above a field near an airport. It slipped beneath the tree line and out of sight. This occured a few miles south of Columbia MIssouri, on highway 63.

It was a dull matte grey color and looked like two inverted contact lenses with a little turret on top,;2007-10-15 18:58:00;3 min;I was driving on Highway Z about 7 miles north of Columbia and saw something up in the sky.  I thought it was a helicopter but it did not appear to be moving.  It was a dull matte grey color and looked like two inverted contact lenses with a little turret on top, with a large round blue/white light on one side.  Whatever way the object was moving was the way the light faced. A vehicle was stopped on the other side of the road with 3 occupants in it, watching the object.  1 female and 1 male were standing up in the bed of the truck and 1 male was standing on the dash of the driver’s side.  I pulled over, opened my car window and turned my vehicle off to see if I could hear anything.   I was about 60 feet from that vehicle, and sat and watched it for a while.   One of the males yelled over to me if I saw that, I answered yeah, that's why I stopped.  They asked what it was and I said I didn't know.  The object would stay in one spot for a while, then move very   slowly, then stop, then move again, never with any noise.  It finally arced around and moved faster away towards the northwest.

The craft I saw looks exactly like the picture posted on Coast To Coast for George Knapp by Kirk Mints.  It was a clear early morning.;2009-06-12 04:30:00;10 minutes;The craft I saw looks exactly like the picture posted on Coast To Coast for George Knapp by Kirk Mints.  It was a clear early morning.  The craft was slanted downward like the picture, then went level and faded out.  I watched the whole time.   I told myself I was going to be brave and watched it through my binocular.  June 12, 2009 at 4:30 A.M.   There were red and white lights under the craft.   I am glad I can report this..get it off my mind.  Thank you for having this site for people who see strange things.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
Extremely shiny silver football shaped flying object shows up as only a partial outline in a photo I took of it.;2014-10-21 15:49:00;15 seconds;Extremely shiny silver football shaped flying object shows up as only a partial outline in a photo I took of it. Today, Tues. Oct. 21, 2014 at about 3:49PM Central Time I was in a conservation are I believed is owned/operated by the University of Missouri name Turkey Farm Lake with my dog.  I had my camera and took photos along the path leading up to the lake. 	When I entered the actual lake area I saw a couple of dead looking branches and was attempting to focus on them without getting any colored leaves in the frame.  When I looked up I saw an object in the sky.  I said out loud, “What the f*ck is that?!”. 	The object was not a plane, nor a helicopter, blimp, etc…  It was not extremely high in the sky.  I would say maybe a couple football fields’ lengths from me.  I was shaped like a semi-deflated football, actually, and silver in color and extremely shiny.  I did not notice a sound and it was moving slowly horizontally. 	I immediately aimed my camera and took a photo.  I then realized the branches were still in the frame, and because they were so close to me, that the object it’s self would not be in focus.  I then looked to the sky, saw the object moving away from me and stepped forward trying to get a better shot… As I looked through my viewfinder I could not spot the object so I removed the camera from my eye, looking to the sky and the object was gone. 	About a minute after spinning myself in circles trying to figure out where this object moved to and feeling totally confused about what I just witnessed I opened the clock on my phone and took a screenshot to document the date and time.  It was 3:51 PM. 	After I returned home and transferred my photos to my computer I saw something totally unexpected in the one photo I got of the object.  Instead of  an out-of-focus silver football shaped flying vehicle I knew should be in the photo I saw a partial outline.  It is a dark shadowy outline, boomerang-shaped, representing only the leading end of the object, probably about ¼  the size of what I saw with my eyes.  This is shocking because the object was fully visible to me even after I took that initial shot, however in the photo it appears to be almost completely transparent. 	So far I have only told this to my mother and father… I attempted to call your hotline about half an hour ago, around 8:25 PM and I left a message because no one answered.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
