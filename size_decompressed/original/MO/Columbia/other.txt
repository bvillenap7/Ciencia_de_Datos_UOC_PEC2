unusual speed and definition;2001-11-03 17:55:00;6-10 seconds;unusual speed and definition Bright dot of light at approx. zenith traveling south to north.  Appeared directly overhead and appeared to travel approx. 15 degrees before disappearing.  Appeared to be approx. same diameter as Jupiter at zenith, but was intensely white and bright. The object was circular in shape, very well defined, moving at an extremely high rate of speed.  What made this observation unusual was the absolute lack of smearing as it progressed (being a longtime viewer/photographer of meteor showers I'm well aware of normal characteristics) and the abrupt disappearence of the object. Both my wife and I viewed this object and we concur in our descriptions of what we observed.  We are avid viewers of the night sky and absolute skeptics.  The lack of smearing and the excellent definition of the object are why we are submitting this report. Hypothesis non fingo.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
Flashes of light with smaller lights about level of where satellites orbi;2007-09-22 21:05:00;1 hour;Flashes of light with smaller lights about level of where satellites orbi Date of occurrence: September 22, 2007, between 9:15 PM and 10:05 PM CST  I saw the most amazing sight last night while lying out and watching the stars. I witnessed it between 9:15 PM CST and 10:05 PM CST. As I looked up I saw an object fly into my line of sight at about the level I've seen satellites. As I watched it, it moved erratically in short bursts until it semi settled into a particular part of the sky. Not being an astronomer, I can't tell you which part nor the longitude and latitude. As I watched it, I noticed that there were very large spokes of light emanating from it in all directions. Sometimes there would be flashes. There were also smaller lights flying into and out of the larger light. It stayed in position for quite a while moving erratically at times and only for short distances. It was amazing, I didnâ€™t want to take my eyes off of it, but I wanted my binoculars. I went in to get them and when I came back out it was gone, of course.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
Missouri Investigators Group Report:  Two adult witnesses observe, and photograph, approaching object.;2018-07-16 20:01:00;15 seconds;Missouri Investigators Group. Barb Becker ufomig@yahoo.com   We were sitting in front of Noodles and Company at Trimble and Conley Roads enjoying an ice cream when I noticed something very low in the sky approaching us from the south.  I got my phone out and took three pictures through the open window.  What had originally called my attention to the sky turned out to be a helicopter although we were close enough to hear sound we heard none.  (A friend has a software program to analyze photos and could see, with about 90% certainty, that the original object was a helicopter.)  But above the traffic light standard there appeared another object.  This one was a square.  It had no heat signature, wings or rotors.  I don't believe I actually saw it with my eyes, but discovered it on the pictures.   This is the second time we have seen objects flying over this area.   (See my two reports on NUFORC dated 4/20/2017.) ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Barb Becker, MO Investigators Group, for submitting the report.  PD));38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
