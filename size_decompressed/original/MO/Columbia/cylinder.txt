Oblong-shaped object in the morning sky over interstate;2005-07-27 08:00:00;2 - 3 minutes;Oblong-shaped object in the morning sky over interstate I do not know what I saw.  I cannot say if I simply saw an airplane or if it was something else.  The reason I find the sighting odd is because of my location.  I was not near an airport that could have handled a large plane.  This object was further away from the small airport than it should have been were it coming in for a safe landing.  As I drove home around 8am Wednesday morning, I glanced towards the sky as I came over a slight hill and noticed a metal glint against a cloud in the sky.  It caught my eye because it was so clear.  I pulled over to watch it.  The object was definitely several miles away and would have been visible from the interstate.  It didn't move very fast.  There was no vapor trail.  It appeared to be oblong shaped and silver in color.  I watched until it passed behind a cloud.  At this same time I had my window rolled down and heard nothing.  I didn't expect to being so far away.  Again, I really can't say if it this was simply an airplane or something else.  It was odd enough for me to find it out of the ordinary.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
UFO MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS REPORT:   I was in the front yard of my home and saw a glistening aluminum fuselage.;2006-06-24 19:30:00;30 seconds;In June of 2006 I was in the front yard of my home and looked up and saw, at a low altitude, what appeared to be only the glistening aluminum fuselage of a plane. It was much lower than a large passenger plane or blimp. No sound was heard. It was low enough that I should have been able to see wings, tail and windows but I saw nothing. The sun was shining directly on the object. It saw it twice in June, each time it was around 7:30 (19:30 hrs). It was in view each time about 30 seconds. The direction of travel was SW to NE. There was no way to tell how big it was except that it appeared to be about a half an inch at arms length.  We have one airport, Regional. The runway does not accomodate large planes. Planes traveling across Missouri are always at a higher altitude than this object was. Small 2 or 4 seater planes fly over at a lower altitude and it is always easy to see detail such as wings, tail and registration numbers. The engine noise is audible as well.   I saw this object again on July 4th, 2006. See that report on NUFORC website.  I have no idea what I saw nor can I guess. I just offer this report up as another oddity of this haunted planet.

MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  I looked up and saw, at a low altitude, what appeared to be only a fuselage of a plane.;2006-07-04 19:30:00;2 minutes;I was at my house and looked up and saw, at a low altitude, what appeared to be only a fuselage of a plane. In June of 2006 I was in the front yard of my home and looked up and saw, at a low altitude, what appeared to be only the glistening aluminum fuselage of a plane. It was much lower than a large passenger plane or blimp. No sound was heard. It was low enough that I should have been able to see wings, tail and windows but I saw nothing. The sun was shining directly on the object. It saw it twice in June, each time it was around 7:30 (19:30 hrs).  The direction of travel was SW to NE. Then I was at a July 4th fireworks display at the Hearnes Center in Columbia, Mo. and the thing came right over where we were sitting. This time it was a round 8:30  (20:30hrs). The direction of travel was about the same as the previous sighting.  I have not seen the object again since July and I have looked. We have one airport and it does not accomodate large planes.  Planes going from St. Louis to KC are at a much higher altitude than what I saw. I have seen plenty of small planes pass over my house before but the wings and tail are always easily visible.  I have no idea what I saw nor can I guess. I just offer this report up as another oddity of this haunted planet.

UFO MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP REPORT: I was looking to the S when I saw what I believed to be a plane coming in our directionâ€¦;2006-07-04 20:30:00;45 seconds;I was looking to the south when I saw what I believed to be a plane coming in our direction... I was at a July 4th fireworks display at the Hearnes Center in Columbia, Mo. We were all impatiently waiting for the fireworks to begin. I was looking to the south when I saw what I believed to be a plane coming in our direction but as it passed over us I realized it was the same silvery cylindrical object I saw in June (see June 2006 NUFORC report). As before it was much lower than a large passenger plane or blimp. It was around 8:30 this time so it was a little darker and the object seemed a little higher than in June, but I could see that it had no wings and no tail.  The direction of travel was about the same as the June sighting. There was too much crowd noise to be able to hear any sound from the object. I looked around to see if anyone else was looking at it and I could not detect anyone looking up. I tried to get the people I was with to look at the object but everyone was too busy having fun and talking. A simple glance and it would be mistaken for a plane. One would need to really look at it to realize it wasnt ordinary.  We have one airport, Regional. The runway does not accomodate larger planes. Planes traveling across Missouri are always at a higher altitude than this object was. Small 2 or 4 seater planes fly over at a lower altitude and it is always easy to see detail such as wings and tail. The engine noise is audible as well.  I have not seen the object again since July but that doesnt mean it cant still be flying around. I saw it in July because I basically came to it. Had I been at home I would not have seen it .  I have no idea what I saw nor can I guess. I just offer this report up as another oddity of this haunted planet.  Persona sighting  - B.

We all watched the object until it went out of sight. It was silver in color and did not have wings or a tail. Not able to discern true size or distance of object although it seemed quite low.

MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  I was outside doing lawn work when I looked up and saw what looked like a plane.;2007-06-24 19:40:00;1 minute;I was outside doing lawn work when I looked up and saw what looked like a plane...but I knew it wasnt I was outside doing lawn work when I looked up and saw what looked like a plane...but I knew it wasn't because I have seen this thing before. I called for my husband to bring out the binoculars. Looking through the binoculars I saw what looked like a fuselage of a plane only without wings and a tail. It was thinner than a blimp, it did not have a gondola or any other portrusions nor were there any discernable markings. When I first saw it it was traveling south to north but then changed heading to northwest. It is difficult to judge altitude and size...it seemed low and measured about an inch at arms length. B.

Hurling grey white cylinder object in the skies over Missouri.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-01 02:00:00;<1 minute;Hurling grey white cylinder object in the skies over Missouri. It was early morning time, I got a phone call, I walked out on the back patio, I had been out for about 5 minutes.  I just happen to look up because I heard a weird noise in the sky, sounded like it was behind me, so when I looked up, I seen what appeared to be a light grey white cylinder object just hurling along up in the sky, it was pretty far.   Then it appeared to go straight into what was a white light, upon doing so, the white light or other craft, turned red like an incoming signal.   It was really awesome and weird at the same time, I've never seen nothing like that before in my life.  Not sure what it was but it was definitely not from any technology I've ever seen.
