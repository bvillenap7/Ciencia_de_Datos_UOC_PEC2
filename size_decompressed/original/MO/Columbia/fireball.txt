bright meteor;2006-12-08 19:30:00;2 seconds;bright meteor Saw a spectacular meteor while waiting at the Worley intersection, facing north on Stadium Blvd.  I saw a flash in the sky, through my windshield, which caused me look out the drivers side window.  I witnesed what looked like a meteor, with a spark trail traveling west somewhere north of Interstate 70.  This is a very busy and bright area of town with several shopping centers, so the light had to be intense to see this object.  I did look down at the clock, to check the time, after this occured.  Was not going to report because I'm certain that it was a meteor.  Decided to report when I saw the recent updates from Ottawa, IL and Pittsburg & St. Ann, MO from the same day/time describing this event.  To give some perspective of the size/intensity, the witness in Pittsburg, MO would have been approx. 90 miles SSW of my sighting.

A ball of light looked like it was hovering very high and then took off to the South.;2011-05-01 21:00:00;2 minutes;A ball of light looked like it was hovering very high and then took off to the South. I was walking back to my fraternity house and glanced up in the sky and noticed a ball of light to the east of Mizzou's campus.  I saw a brother of mine and he saw it as well.   Then, out of nowhere, it took off to the South and the light of it faded as it left.   I probably saw it for about two minutes and my brother for one minute.   The object looked like a ball of fire, originally I thought it was a planet.  We were between study sessions when we saw, we're both 19 years old.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
Single large fireball traveling SSE with no decrease in altitude for two minutes before abruptly extinguishing.;2013-02-26 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Single large fireball traveling SSE with no decrease in altitude for two minutes before abruptly extinguishing While digging my car out of a snowbank in my driveway with a neighbor, I was distracted by a light in the sky at 21:00 on February 26, 2013.  I am an amateur astronomer and also a nurse at the local trauma hospital (University Hospital in Columbia MO), so I assumed that the light was a Life Flight helicopter en route to the hospital (3.5 miles SSE of my house).   However, when I looked up, there was no helicopter... and the UFO was completely silent.  The UFO was a fireball, best described as an intensely orange light (seemingly lit from within) with flame-like orange  light emanating from the center without consuming it.  The speed of the craft was less than the speed of a helicopter, and despite the fire, there was no decrease in altitude.   The UFO traveled fairly low ( the clouds were low and the UFO traveled below or at the cloud cover) in a south/southeast direction.  After approximately two minutes, the UFO seemed to extinguish abruptly and faded from sight with no decrease in altitude.  I remarked to my friend several times that there was no sound at all from the UFO the night was very quiet and I could only hear the traffic from I-70, one mile south of us.  I asked her to take a photo with her cell, but she was so disturbed by the UFO that she ran into her house carrying the snow shovel.   In my approximately 40 years of sky-watching, I have never seen anything resembling a UFO ... and certainly nothing resembling a slowly-moving fireball that burns without consuming itself or losing altitude or making a sound.  Thank you for your time, expertise, and dedicated work.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
