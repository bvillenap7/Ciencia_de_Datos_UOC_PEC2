It was a large tria;1999-10-15 02:30:00;one minute;My friend and I were out looking for shooting stars on a country road when this large unknown object flew over us.  It was a large triangle shaped object that made no noise and was moving at a fairly high rate of speed.  I know it was triangle because it had a bright light at each point. The object moved across the sky slow enough for us to really get a good look at it.  It made no noise, at least not that we could here and was in the shape of a triangle.  At first I thought it was a plane or some kind of formation used by military aircraft.  I realized that this was not the case when I noticed that this object was close enough to us that if mthey were tradtional planes, we would have heard them fly by.  It never turned or made any sudden moves, just traveled from the southwest to the north-northwest and eventually out of sight.  We passed it off as something no one would ever believe, and something we could ,never prove we saw, but I recently saw a news report here in Columbia that described others who had seen the same thing my friend and I saw, so for what it's worth, we saw it to but have no earthly idea what it was.  It was triangle in shape with lights at each corner, it was fairly large and made no noise, the middle of the craft looked open or see through but I may be wrong about that, but it definently was not a solid craft because I could see stars in the sky within the triangle of lights.  This is true, I don't want to be famous or popular, I just want to know what it was I saw, and I wanted to somehow let those that have seen this object that they are not alone.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

The craft was a triangular object that had 3 very bright lights It had 1 light on each corner of the triangle.The lights were a bright white or yellow.It also had a circular object in the center of the triangle,it looked to be a window or door of some kind.Possibly even another light that was not illuminated.The craft also had 2 rods or poles that protruded out of the front of the craft.They also seemed to be lights,but also were not illuminated.The craft was approximately 60-70 ft.long.We saw this craft just on the south-east side of Columbia,MO at about 9:45pm on dec. 1,1999.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
Visiting with friends when I looked out the patio door and saw an unusually bright light coming from the west.;1999-12-01 21:55:00;5 minutes;Visiting with friends when I looked out the patio door and saw an unusually bright light coming from the west. Visiting with guests, I was looking out the patio door, when I noticed an unusually bright light in the western sky.  Everyone, (two others), got up to look, then we all ran into the back yard.  It passed very close to us, maybe 80 to 100 feet high and 300 feet away. It was quite large, 55 to 100 feet long.  It moved very slowly, maybe 15 mph, allowing us a good view of the underside of the craft. There was no discernable sound. We all described the same shaped object with only a few differences. I saw a triangle with two headlights positioned about a third of the way back on each side, round white lights on each tip of the triangle and a red light in the center.  The other two witnesses saw a triangle with a yellowish light in the center and flashing red lights around the perimeter of the craft. I lost sight of it as it moved east because I went into the house to get fourth witness. When I returned with the fourth witness the craft was already in a turn and heading southeast. He and I described the object identically, however, as it was turning I saw a bright white light drop from its right side. I did not see where the second object (light) went. The fourth witness ran into the house and dialed 911. That call was received ao 10:01P/CST. We refrred to NUFORC. (Uploaded by investigator. Note: It has been suggested that the witnesses saw a DC9 on a routine nightly flight. There is a flight that arrives at Columbia Regional Airport between 10:00 and 10:15P/CST and leaves at approximately 10:35. But airport director, Bill Boston, said that this flight would probably not be in the area of this sighting. Also at approximately 9:45P, December 1, 1999, another witness sighted a triangular shaped craft flying north over Highway 63. Each witness of these separate events drew the same type craft complete with headlights.);38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
My wife, Daughter and her friend were traveling East on Rt. HH when the object was observed at the intersection of HH and Kircher Rd.  ;1999-12-08 21:30:00;5 min.;My wife, Daughter and her friend were traveling East on Rt. HH when the object was observed at the intersection of HH and Kircher Rd.  It was triangular with very bright White and Red lights.  It hovered over the trees and then disappeared out of sight behind a hill. My wife was taking my daughter's friend home.  They were headed East on Rt. HH (North of Columbia off of Rt.B) when my daughters' friend spotted the object.  It scared my wife as she thought it was an airplane crashing into the trees.  It came from the North and crossed their path at the intersection of Kircher Rd. and Rt. HH.  My wife was scared to turn onto the gravel Rd. (Kircher) but did, as the object was immediately in front off them.  As they turned onto Kircher, the object hovered over the trees just off to their left.  It was moving sporadically.  It would hover and then move, hover and move again.  My daughter found her camera but by the time she got it ready, the object had disappeared out of sight.  My wife is not a believer in U.F.O.'s but I listen to Art Bell sometimes.  Needless to say, I made fun of them all until I started to here reports all over town about this event.  The children had their windows down and the object made no noise as it hovered.  The distance was hard to judge but that is a heavily wooded area so they would had to been very close to it to been able to see it as long as they did.  They didn't want to report it for fear people would think them crazy but after hearing reports of the same exact sighting, I thought you might be interested in these facts.  My daughters' friend called tonight (12-10-99) and told us that a boy in that area, witnessed the object floating over his house.  This is not a normal occurence for this area and certainly not for my wife.  My daghter has been effected by this sighting.  Her fear is that no one will believe her.  I didn't help much by making fun of them when they returned home.  I've been all over the U.S. , Canada and even traveled abroad and have never seen anything remotely suspicious but there is no doubt that my family and friends have spotted something strange in the area.  I asked them how they couldn't make out a shape of the vehicle at such close range and they all said the lights were so bright that they couldn't see anythin! g else. They were larger than aircraft landing lights and much brighter.  My wife recalls seeing white and red as do the children.  No noise was heard.  We have gone to the University where the Flight For Life helicopter takes off and lands.  You can here it with the car windows up from a much greater distance than they could have possibly been at.  They claim that the lights are much brighter also.  Thanks for your forum.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

07/06/00  21:30 Columbia, MO Huge black triangle, bright lights at tips hovering over city 5-10 minutes. Slowly moving east then gone!;2000-07-06 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;07/06/00  21:30 Columbia, MO Huge black triangle, bright lights at tips hovering over city 5-10 minutes. Slowly moving east then gone! The date was July 6, 2000. An easy date to verify since it was the date of President Clinton's visit to Missouri University here in Coloumbia, MO.  It had just become dark. I was on my bicycle and was peddling west on Wilks Blvd. just north of Columbia Collage.  I stopped at 8th street. As as I crossed 8th street I noticed a very bright light in the sky, slightly to the south of my location but north of the Missouri University complex and the downtown business district.  It was like a helicoptor search light and seemed to be at about two to three thousand feet altitude. However, there was no red or green running light, or strobe light and there was no noise!  I then noticed there was a second, similar bright light at least two football fields to the south and a third similar, bright light at least three football fields to the east! The lights formed a huge triangle in the night sky.  My first thought was that they were very quiet military helicopters hovering over the sight of President Clinton's address to the nation from the university campus. Then I noticed that within the huge triangle the stars were blotted out!  There was a huge, apparently solid object hovering in the night sky over the city of Columbia, Missouri!  There was a police car parked on 8th street and as I started to go toward the squad car the three lights in the sky started moving in tandem slowly to the east. The police car started moving north towards me and I tried to flag them down but they evidently had been dispatched and they paid no attention to my attempt to stop them.  The lights at the tips of the triangular craft never changed in color or brightness.  There were no other lights or distinguishable characteristics visible or audible to me. As I peddled to the south to maintain my view of the UFO I looked down the street and when I looked back up and it was gone!  It just disappeared!  I had heard of Art Bell's tales of big black triangles in the sky and WAS a complete skeptic of the phenomenon.  I was a grade school teacher. I am an ex-special forces medic who became a chiropractor (PCC, 1969).  I don't drink, smoke or do recreational or pharmaceutical drugs.  I am a well read, 65 years young health nut who takes very good care of my self. I have flown and jumped from many different aircraft. I have a good sense of what I observed.  I  believe that what I saw was not created by our then-current or now current human technology.  SOME VERY INTELLIGENT ENTITY IS OBSERVING US just like we observe our flocks and heards!  I hope we don't get treated by them like we treat our plants and animals!  We had best straighten up our behavior and fly right... The consenquences of our acts could be frightening.

While taking the pooch for a ride I saw an unusual craft;2001-06-08 22:30:00;1 minute;While taking the pooch for a ride I saw an unusual craft On Thursday night, June 7, I was taking my dog for a ride (it relaxes both of us), we pretty much take the same route for each ride.  I have seen planes in this area before, but usually they are high and just passing over from St. Louis to Kansas City. This night, this plane looked odd. It had two bright lights on the front and no blinking lights.  I stopped the truck and turned the engine off but I was a little too far away to get a good look.  I figured it was a (regular) plane.  The next night, Friday, at just about the same time, it was the same route, only with a slight variation which put me closer to the path of this plane. Once again I stopped the truck and turned off the engine.  I watched as it flew almost overhead.  I thought, that's odd, it looked triangular, it had three whitish lights on each tip, but I was still thinking it was a plane, and then I saw the red light in the center of the triangle, it appeared larger than the white ones and I also noticed smaller lights which seemed to be closer to the body of the craft, so that the others seemed to protrude. Then it hit me that this might not be a conventional aircraft! It traveled a path, each night, from northwest, making an arc just about the 122 mile marker on highway 70 and then heading southwest. Northwest direction would be the direction that Whiteman AFB is and the home of the Stealth.  It wouldnt surprise me to find out that this was a Stealth aircraft. I did call Whiteman and spoke with the airflight control, who told me they didnt know what the underside of the Stealth looked like at night. So no info there.. Nor were they aware of any flights at those times, but...? I assured them I wasnt a spy, of course if I were I would all ready know all this! I am a UFO investigator though, MIG: Missouri Investigators roup,(B.Becker@iname.com)and I have taken reports describing exactly this same type of craft.  I dont know what it is, or whose it is, but I know its here. ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Barbara Becker, of MIG in Missouri, for this report.

the object changed colors changed direction and speed;2001-10-03 22:32:00;five minutes;the object changed colors changed direction and speed I was driving in my car way out in the country on my way home when I saw to my right, 3 white lights formed in a triangle shape. At first I thought it was just an airplane, because I live somewhat near an airport. The craft was moving very slow headed south,  so slow that I had to stop the car to see if it was moving at all, which it was. I stopped the car and got out, and noticed that it was getting close and still wasn't making any noise of any kind. I got back in the car and started the engine. There were some trees in the way so I couldn't see the craft now, so I turned around and headed east. I looked to my right and the triange had changed direction almost like it knew i was trying to follow it and was scared away and was now headed east as well, and as it started to really pick up some speed I now could no longer follow it. But I could still see it, and the white lights started to turn red and blue, they didn't change like a light going on, more like a transition. Then as it was starting to get far away i could tell that the speed was changing slow then fast then slow then fast, sort of like a pulse then i couldn't see it any more.

Trangular shaped solid white lights with solid amber light in middle. Columbia, MO;2007-07-18 23:00:00;1 min;Trangular shaped solid white lights with solid amber light in middle. Columbia, MO Columbia, MO  On the night of July 18, 2007 I observed an object in the sky. The only thing I could see against the sky were 3 solid white lights in a perfect equilateral triangle with a solid orange/amber light in the middle. I could see no outline of an aircraft, only the lights.  The sound was lower than any other aircraft I've seen flying overhead. It also seemed to be flying both slower and lower than other any other aircraft I've seen at night, although it was hard to tell against the night sky and since I couldn't see any outline of the craft.  It traveled in approximately a nw - se direction.  I can't say the exact time it was since it was several weeks ago but can approximate somewhere between 2200 and 0000 at night.  I told my parents the next day about it so they can collaborate the story.  I've been trying to find aircraft light configurations since then to figure out what it was but all that comes up are UFO sites, and I've never seen an aircraft without a blinking light on it. These were all solid and in a perfect equilateral triangle.  We do live in the same state as the Stealth Bomber is housed, although several hundred miles away and I don't know if  the light pattern matches the bomber, although that would explain the lower sound it made.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  The shape of the UFO was triangular with white lights on each of the corners and a big red light.;2007-10-20 22:00:00;2 min;Me and a friend were driving home from a friend's birthday party around 10:00 to 10:30 PM. A little ways past his house we noticed a very bright light to our left. Looking at it first I said Why is that plane flying so low? But then it dropped down from where it originally was and was coming closer to our car. That’s when my friend said That’s not a plane. The shape of the UFO was triangular with white lights on each of the corners and a big red light in the center. It also had many other little lights but are harder to remember. I rolled down my window to try to take a picture with my camera cell phone, and that’s when I noticed that the UFO was completely silent. No noise of an engine or anything, dead silent. I took a picture on my phone, but it turned out very blurred, it was just a blurry splotch of light on my phone. The craft then rose up higher after passing over our car and moved into the distance out of our sight. After seeing this we were both in shock because of how close our encounter was.

Triangular craft with three lights seen at night on Broadway Blvd. in Columbia MO;2008-01-03 23:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular craft with three lights seen at night on Broadway Blvd. in Columbia MO Traveling home from a friends house this evening at 11:00 P.M. central time in Columbia MO, turning onto Broadway Blvd., my sister and I witnessed 2 very bright lights in the sky toward the west side of the Blvd.  At first I thought it may be a bright pair of stars in the sky, but as we approached, and it approached us, I seriously began to grow concerned.  The object seemed to be traveling along the street, toward us, but moving very slowly and only flying about 200-300 ft off the ground above the street.  Originally 2 lights were in view, but as we got closer, I noticed that there were 3 lights on the bottom of the craft, in a triangle formation.  At this point I was literally yelling at my sister to confirm the object herself, and she seemed very concerned about it as well.  The object then passed directly over our vehicle while we were stopped at a light.  I stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the object, and to see if there were any sounds coming from the craft... there were none, which seemed very disturbing to me.  I asked my sister if she heard anything, such as helicopter rotors or an aircraft engine, and she said she did not.  As I looked straight up at the craft, I very clearly saw that it was triangular in shape, with a circular light at each tip, and an illuminated white line connecting each light.  There was also a square panel at the bottom of the craft that was glowing red, and a smaller yellow light next to that that was pulsing.  I have never seen anything like this before.  The craft moved so slowly that it is impossible to have stayed airborne if it were a plane, and absolutely no sound was heard coming from the craft at close proximity to indicate that it was some sort of helicopter. The object then continued east down the Blvd. until it was out of sight. This object must surely have been seen by many observers, and after seeing it, cars around us were driving erratically, passing each other on city streets illegally and driving very fast.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959

Slow to very fast glowing orange triangle moved over entire horizon seen by 3 people in Columbia, MO.;2011-07-04 21:00:00;1 minute;Slow to very fast glowing orange triangle moved over entire horizon seen by 3 people in Columbia, Missour. On July 4th, 2011, I was in Columbia, Missouri, I was downtown viewing a fireworks display facing southeast from a friend's backyard around 9PM and about 1 mile from the display.  I saw a  triangle-shaped orange spark move out of the fireworks and continue to go up in to the sky without exploding or fading out.  It continued to move at a slow and steady pace up and northwest in the sky until it was directly over my head after maybe a minute or so of  watching it perplexed about how in the hell this thing was able to keep going.  The distance above us is uncertain, but it seemed small and very distant.  If I was to give it a size from my perspective on the ground I would say about the size of a grain of rice. I would have been able to assume it to be just about anything else if it did not suddenly increase at an unnaturally fast speed and continued northwest until it was out of view in a matter of seconds or maybe less.  I looked at my friend who had just watched the same thing and had the same reaction, What the f*ck was that?  The only time I have ever seen anything going from what seemed to be 0 miles an hour to turbo speed within a matter of a second of so is in sci-fi movies and that is exactly the type of movement that I saw.  The span of the horizon at the distance the object seemed to be at covered within 1 minute seems truly bizarre to me.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
