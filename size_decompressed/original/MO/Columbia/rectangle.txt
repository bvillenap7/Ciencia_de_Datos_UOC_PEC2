About 22:35, March 21, 2015, Columbia, MO, white to a very light color, no lights, rectangular like a ruler with 45 degree ends.;2015-03-21 22:35:00;1-2 minutes;About 22:35, March 21, 2015, Columbia, MO, white to a very light color, no lights, rectangular like a ruler with 45 degree ends. Friend and I were standing in the parking lot, basically facing north.  I tend to look up at the sky often at night.  But we were talking.   All of a sudden I noticed something almost white looking in the sky heading NNW.  My first thought was geese.  I have seen them fly over parking lots at night and they look very interesting in the night sky.   So, I listened to hear them, but noticed something odd.  The shape was a rectangle, about the shape of a ruler in the sky laying flat, but the ends had about a 45 degree angle at each end.   A few seconds in this, I then pointed and just as I did, he saw it too.  And we described the same, object to each other.  It glided silently in the same direction and then we lost sight of it within 15 seconds or so.  It was not terribly high in he air.  Maybe a couple hundred feet in the air.  I almost look the length of a bus in the sky.  But not very wide.   I keep trying to convince myself it was a flock of geese.  But I have saw a definite shape and my friend did too.  We are very curious what that could have been?;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
UFO with open bay doors on the bottom of it.;2019-07-14 23:10:00;one min.;UFO with opend bay doors on the bottom of it. I was outside on my back porch at 2300 hours looking at the moon with my telescope. There was some overcast around the moon.  It was clear over the rest of the sky. I sat down to wait for the clouds to move from around the moon.  I saw a bright light coming out of the southwest toward my house.  There were lights flashing.  No noise.  I would venture to say it was about 5000 ft up and coming down toward my house.  It is turning to a more direct east path and crossed right over my head.  I was filming it and taking pics of it with my cell phone.  The main craft was elongated rectangle with no wings.  It had bright lights at the front and back of it.  There were little orbs of light flying around it.  The large craft opend up bays doors on the bottom of the craft.  It was a very bright light coming out of the bay area but, I could see pipes and structures, beams of light flying around inside of it too.  As it passed by me I at first it looked like tail lights on the back of it but, I realized it was different colored orbs floating on the back of the craft. It was not going to fast about 50 or 60 Mile an hour is my guess.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
