My neighbor came over to ask if I had noticed the unusual lights. We went out on the deck and watched for about 30-45 minutes. Three oval lights moving at a high speed were hovering, randomly darting, and going in circles. We considered some kind of advertising beams, but found the overall patterns to be very fast and random, not mechanical. Lights appeared in the northern sky over a residential part of the city. We reported it to 911. My neighbor who used to work for the military thought suggested some sort of reconnaisance mission. She is in her 40's and I am in my mid-50's. Neither of us had ever seen anything like it before.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
Approximately ten bright red lights zigzagging in the sky.

All but two lights disappeared and one flew over close enough to see. I was driving west out of Columbia, MO, on I-70 when I noticed several red objects at a distance.  I would estimate there were about ten of them. They were flying close together and zigzagging around.  As I got closer, most of the red lights disappeared leaving two.  One flew right over my car and it looked rather oblong shaped, mostly red but had some yellow in it.  It looked somewhat hazy.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
