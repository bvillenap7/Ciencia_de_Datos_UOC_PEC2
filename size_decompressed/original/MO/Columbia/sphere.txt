Observed small nonreflective sphere traveling SW at a low altitude;1999-08-19 11:30:00;60 seconds;Observed small nonreflective sphere traveling SW at a low altitude Went to field behind my house to pick some tomatoes.  Looked up, as usual, and saw small whitish sphere traveling to the SW.  It was low enough that if it were a plane I should have heard engine noise also, there were no wings nor fuselage visible.  It did not reflect sunlight but appeared white.  Watched it for about a minute till it went out of sight.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
Small metallic sphere flying slowly South to North in broad daylight;2002-04-01 10:50:00;2 minutes;Small metallic sphere flying slowly South to North in broad daylight Metallic sphere seen flying from South to North at a constant velocity and trajectory. Seemed to change colors as its position changed, due to sunlight reflection. At first I thought it was a bird, I estimate it at 1/2 mile away and approx. 6 ft diameter. Trajectory unchanged by wind.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  Metallic sphere flying from south to north, relatively slowly.;2002-04-01 10:50:00;2 minutes;Metallic sphere flying from south to north, relatively slowly. Seemed to change colors, but I believe it was the sun reflecting off the highly polished surface. Object flew with constant velocity and bearing despite wind. No sound.  Original report received by MIG: Missouri Investigators Group www.ufomig.com B.Becker ufomig@yahoo.com  (Witness contact: Nothing much to add except that the witness said the exact location of the observation was around Business Loop 70 and College Blvd., which places it over a well traveled area. Columbia Police and Boone County Sheriff received no other reports. A call to Columbia Regional Airport, yielded nothing.  Personal comment:  I live in Columbia and I have seen a metallic sphere in the sky on two ocassions.

Bright yellow sphere of light, changing to white and swiftly moving away.;2004-03-12 19:05:00;90 seconds;Bright yellow sphere of light, changing to white and swiftly moving away. I was driving north on South Tomlin Hill Road.  After making the 90º left turn in the road, I was headed west at about 7 miles per hour when I saw a luminous yellow sphere. It was about 45º above my line of sight in front of me and slightly to my right, or north of me, plunging swiftly downward for approximately 1 second, north to south, on about a 30º angle. I thought it was a meteorite. I expected it to burn out, but then it became a bright white light and headed west/northwest. I continued to drive west, speeding up to about 30 miles per hour as the light sped away from me. At this point it resembled a star moving away. It diminished in size until I lost sight of it in the still red glow along the western horizon. I thought perhaps it was a plane but I did not see any blinking lights. There was a jet headed east overhead to my left. The light moving west did not seem to be at the same altitude as the jet. My guess would be that it was perhaps at half the altitude of the jet. Tomlin Hill is higher than the surrounding area making it is possible to see a wide expanse of sky in all directions so I never lost sight of it until it reached the western horizon. I watched it for perhaps 90 seconds.  I live in this area and the Columbia Regional Airport is to the southeast of my home. I am very used to seeing lots of aircraft in the area. I am very familiar with what aircraft look light at night. This did not seem like any craft I’m use to seeing pass overhead at night. It moved west much too fast for a small plane. Even a jetliner passing over head would take about twice as long to cover that same distance. For the brief moment it was plunging down it seemed perfectly round with no distortion around its circumference. Even though I momentarily thought it to be meteorite, there was no smoke trail or streak of light. My impression of its color and shape at this point would be like that of the sun high overhead on a hot hazy day, but not that size and more spherical in shape. It initially appeared about the same size as Venus, still clearly visible in the western sky that evening. It did not twinkle or have any blinking lights. The night was perfectly clear with lots of stars and aircraft visible in the area. I don’t rule out that it may have been a smaller jet of some kind flying at a much lower altitude than that of a jetliner except for its swift downward motion when I first noticed it.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
I was walking to the bar to meet some friends and I noticed to bright star-like objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus & Jupiter?  PD));2008-11-26 17:00:00;45 minutes;I was walking to the bar to meet some friends and I noticed to bright star-like objects.  At first I thought the lights were stars but then I could see other stars in the sky and they were not as bright and big.   As I waited outside the bar I noticed that the two points of light had moved slightly to the right.  To make sure I planted my back to a tree and used a distant tree branch as a reference point, and the straight edge of my lighter as a guide.  I walk away and waited for my friends-about 5 minutes.  I walked back to the tree, planted myself in the same place and noticed that the lights were not in the same place. Each light had moved as if they were connected, although I couldn't see any structure connecting them.  Ten minutes later I returned to the same spot and the lights were noticably moved away from my intial reference point.  The streets were mostly empty as most of the people have left town for the holidays.  I also noticed a red blinking dot, like a helicopter flying in the area of the lights.  My friends pulled up and I showed them the lights and they stared for a while but the lights were fixed and outside of there brightness there was nothing spectacular to them-I'm sure.   One hour or so later we returned to the bar and the lights were gone.  I usually stare at the sky and I have noticed how with time stars change positions in the sky.  Specifically I have observed the constallation Orion change position on many evenings.  The difference is that it usually takes hours for this to happen.  These object were moving very slow, but to fast for stars-due to the Earth moving.  Another thing is that while I was staring at this thing I felt like something was communicating with me (this sounds nuts, I know).  As my friends husband looked at it I noticed that he was also grabbed by something, almost in a hypnotic state for a brief moment.  On the somewhat empty street, earlier, for some reason, I found I couldn't stop looking at it. ((NUFORC Note:  Given the long duration of the event, we suspect that the witness may have been observing the two planets, Venus and Jupiter, which currently are quite prominent in the southwestern sky, at the time of night indicated by the witness.

spherical white flying object flying low;2009-11-10 17:00:00;2 min;spherical white flying object flying low Was close to sunset time.  Occurred between 17:00 and 18:00 (5-6pm central).  Flying very low.  Had a low humming sound.  For a plane/helicopter to be that low, it would sound louder.  Was sherical or oval in shape.  Expected to see a tail on a plane if it were a plane, but saw none and it wasn't a plane.  Had flashing red light and two other white lights on it.  It was southwest bound.  Appeared to be light in color (white?)   Watched it travel southwest.  Was flying in a horizontal position and then appeared to travel at a slanted angle.  Flew behind tree line and continued to southest destination and beyond tree and house lines.  It traveled at a very slow pace the whole time.  I chose to write this because there is another one here that is similar and could be related to this one.  Siting was at my house outside my window across from KOMU TV station south of Columbia by Hwy 63.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
Fifty silent spherical craft moving quickly over Columbia Missouri;2011-09-04 22:30:00;5 minutes;Fifty silent spherical craft moving quickly over Columbia Missouri Approximately fifty spherical craft were seen traveling southward directly over Columbia, Missouri. Altitude of the craft was estimated at 300 feet, speed approximately 60mph, and heading was nearly due south, perhaps south by southwest. Craft had forward facing orange lights, with a smaller red light that rotated the craft. They were completely silent.   Encounter lasted about five minutes.   Craft were in swarms of about seven to ten.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
I noticed something very low in the sky in front of the car. It appeared pale blue in color, almost sky color, about the size of a pea.;2017-04-20 19:55:00;2 minutes;MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP: B. Becker. UFOMIG@yahoo.com.   Part 1: The first observation was a little before 8PM on 4/20/2017.  My husband, who was driving, and I, were traveling east on East Broadway.  We were between Broadway Bluffs and Trimble when I noticed something very low in the sky in front of the car.  It appeared pale blue in color, almost sky color, about the size of a pea at arm’s length, maybe slightly larger.  It was on the passenger side of the car, so I had a good view of it, it seemed to be spherical.  I did not see any appendages, it appeared very smooth.  We stopped at the light at Trimble to make a left turn which gave me time to watch it.  (My husband watched in the rearview mirror.  He confirms my observations.)  At this point I’m thinking it must be a balloon.  It stayed at about the same height and distance from the road as it flew west over Green Valley Drive.  It was approaching a tall stand of trees at Hinkson Creek when it paused in midair and rapidly descended diagonally out of sight.  Ok, not a balloon.  Maybe it was a drone?  About 35 minutes later we went to the area where we had seen it go down very secluded for being in a city.  Hinkson Creek is at the end of Green Valley Drive, which turns south and becomes Moon Valley Road.  Open fields and trees.;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
I was looking west the sun was setting, when I saw a quickly moving object traveling from the northwest to the southeast.;2017-04-20 20:07:00;2 minutes;MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP:  B. Becker. UFOMIG@yahoo.com.  Part 2: Still wondering what we had just seen go down by Hinkson Creek, but driven by the need for ice cream, we continued to Andy’s and queued up at the drive-up window.  It had only been about 5 minutes since the first observation.  I was looking west the sun was setting, when I saw a quickly moving object traveling from the northwest to the southeast.  It appeared silverish and spherical.  It was either quite high or very small.  Then I saw another object which seemed to be trying to overtake the first one, and another one and another one, 6 in all, following the first one.  Of course my first thought was helicopters but we did not hear any kind of mechanical sound.  It finally occurred to me to use my cell phone and try to get a picture.  All I got was small dots, but they are there.  The time was 8:07.  Interestingly a helicopter did fly over to Boone Hospital and it was easily seen and heard of course! it was landing. As an addendum to this report, a friend, who lives in Salem, Missouri, “was entering Columbia on 63 Hwy and saw a white glowing object between 500 and 1000 feet in altitude going over the Femme Bonne Creek.  Estimated speed was 40 mph.  This was on April 6, 2017.  It was traveling south.”;38.9564768608415;-92.3299828478959
