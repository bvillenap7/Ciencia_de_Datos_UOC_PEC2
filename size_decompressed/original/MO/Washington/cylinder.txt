Another appeared possibly 5 minutes after which I saw.  Saw a white segment moving southwest not very high altitude (10,000 maybe) then it just vanished in fron of my eyes.   Shortly after another appeared at much higher altitude, traveled for a short distance and again just vanished.  This moring saw video of Branson UFO from 2009.  Looks as if could be the same thing.;38.5439999999999;-91.0154999999999
