I SEE THINGS IN THE SKY ALL THE TIME;2002-09-03 20:00:00;2 minutes;I SEE THINGS IN THE SKY ALL THE TIME I was outside entering the local YMCA when I looked into the Eastern sky and noticed three different UFO's flying very close to each other. One of them when right in-between the other two. They were making very odd flight patterns in the sky. Sort of a slow motion zig-zag. They were a very bright white color. I look up in the sky a lot. I see things very often. All kinds of things. Do I believe in Aliens? I have to see to believe however, I know there are things out there because the universe is just too big not to believe. I have seen other things too. One time I was looking at the Moon with some binoculars and a huge flash of turqois, yellow, and red hit the moon. Like I said..... I see things all the time. I take no drugs or anything of that nature. I am a normal college male who is ready to get out of college and face the real world. I love the stars and looking at them. I am very curious......;38.5439999999999;-91.0154999999999
