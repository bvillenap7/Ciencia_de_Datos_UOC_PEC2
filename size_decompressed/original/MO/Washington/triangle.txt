Triangle shaped  object  with lots of lights   showed  sings  of commuication  with flash light;2002-09-19 02:35:00;TWO HOURS;Triangle shaped  object  with lots of lights   showed  sings  of commuication  with flash light Ok Iwas sitting on my friends deck,just like the first sighiting that i reported,but this is ten days later.We were outside just talking like normal on the deck,and i decided to look up.In amazment there it was,a triangle object hovering above our heads just like last time.My friend was in compleate shock,because he and I new it was definalty the same object.The blue pale haze around the object gave it away,not a bright haze but noticable.Also the lights on the object was a dead giveaway,green,blue,red,white,again not to noticable.What gets me is what are the chances of seeing the same thing twice in ten days.Just like last time the object showed sings of intellangce, by me useing a good size flashlight.If i held the light on the object it would move in a gravity defiying way.Ore if i held the light on the object and drag the light stream away it would follow exscat motion of the light.Also I left the light on in a upright positon,the object would move cauiously but willing to the beam from the flashlight.I got the felling they were just watching  us to make some kind of contact.

@ Approx 9:45 pm tonight my wife and I were sitting on our deck.;2011-07-01 21:45:00;2:00;@ Approx 9:45 pm tonight my wife and I were sitting on our deck. Heard fire works going off in our Subdivison.  I look to the South and saw through the trees and saw what i thought was an orange  hanging firework it kept rising through the trees and i told my wife (that sure is hanging a long time)  then it came out of the sight of the tree and we could make-out an 'orange 'triangular light. We started yelling @ our daughter & friend to come to wittness this they made it out and as it traveled North it made no sound and suddenly disappeared. ?????
