We were driving home from my Uncles house after getting back from a camping trip. As we drove home i notices 2 red sphere like lights in the sky. When we went over a bridge near my house you could see a vast area of land the went for about 7 miles and the light sat motionless over the river about i would say about a mile in the sky. Once we got home i sat on my back porch a watched as they just sat there motionless. After about a half hour the one light had moved left from the top light being as they were one over the other. As I watched I could see that the bottom one was moving at an incredibly slow rate. I went inside to get my dad. when i showed him it being as he is a skeptic about everything told me it was a Telephone tower. But there was never any telephone tower in that area ever that I had seen and Much higher in the sky than any telephone tower could reach. I went inside to find my Camera. When i went back out side i notice that they had traveled I would estimate about 5 miles away from where they were and were barely visable. I took a few snap shot but when developed showed nothing. After anouther 5 min they finally disappeared i was 17 at the time and im 18 know and it was the most intense night of my life.
