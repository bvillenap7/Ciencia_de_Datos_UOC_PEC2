Slow moving black triangle. No sounds no lights.;2006-01-15 10:15:00;1-2 minutes;Slow moving black triangle. No sounds no lights. We were sitting in hot tub on deck watching the northern and north eastern sky for shooting stars.  It was a clear night sky no clouds perfect for seeing shooting stars.  The house was east of us so the northern horizion was blocked by the house. While we were watching over the roof of the house into the sky a black triangle with no lights and no sound went over the house.  The stars started disappearing as the craft blocked them from our view.  The stars reappeared as it passed.  When it was directly over head you could make out the variation between the night sky and the black color of the craft.  There were very close in color but you could make out the distinct sharp edges of the craft.   The bottom was flat as flat can be.  The edges of the craft were sharp like a blade not rounded.  There was no visable rounding of any part of the craft.  The craft was a triangle its sides appeared to be equal.   It moved very very slowly I would guess it to be 100 yards across the leading edge and so for the other two edges.   I would guess it to have been moving at around 20 to 30 miles an hour.;39.4192;-92.4366
I just happened to look up at the sky to the northeast of Walmart. I saw this triangle shaped craft.;2015-11-13 11:55:00;1 minute;Missouri Investigators Group report. UFOMIG@yolasite.com.  I saw a UFO I think.  I have never seen anything like it before.  I was at the Walmart Super Center at Moberly, Mo. (1301 East Highway 24.) I was sitting in my car reading, my wife was inside getting new glasses.   It was a clear day not a cloud in the sky.  I just happened to look up at the sky to the northeast of Walmart.  I saw this triangle shaped craft. About a third of the tips of the triangle was reddish color, the rest of it was silver.   The first time I saw it for about 30 seconds then it vanished for about 10 seconds.  Later I saw it again for about 5 TO 10 seconds then it vanished in a clear blue sky.   I don't know what it was, I don't know any airplanes that look like that.  Maybe you have some idea on it.;39.4192;-92.4366
Triangle shaped lights hovering in the sky just disappeared;2019-07-21 14:25:00;20-30 seconds;Triangle shaped lights hovering in the sky just disappeared I was in moberly yesterday at Lowe's waiting in the car on my mom.  I'm not sure what I seen but I'm pretty sure it wasn't normal.  At first it just looked like red lights, then I could tell they were in the shape of a triangle.  After staring at it better I could kinda see the shape of the triangle kinda see thru or bright silver.  Then it just all disappeared.
