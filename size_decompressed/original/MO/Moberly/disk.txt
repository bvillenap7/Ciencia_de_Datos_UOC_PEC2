After 2 years, I'am so happy to read so many other reports from around the US from other people who are just walking the dog or smoking a cig. out on the patio and observe the wonders of the moving stars  in the heavens above us.   Well, last Friday, I began a trip across 6 states with my destination Moberly Missouri to see my beloved boyfriend.  As you can imagine, I was really anxious to check out the night skies as I travled across miles and miles of unpopulated, unpolluted, natural land........ and sky!!!!!!!!!   I had plenty of time to watch the sky day and night because I wasnt driving.  I spotted shadows behind clouds in the day that were a disk shape, dark in hue at least twice.  I saw one cloud that was moving the opposite direction than the other clouds, and this was definately not normal.   When we got into Missouri, we stopped in a small city by the name of Sarcosie, and I saw a dark bouish disc shadow moving around behind the clouds at a very low altitude.  I cannot explain any of the things I see...yet...but I swear that my accounts of what I see are ALL true.  Just watch the skies patiently any time you can, day or night, and you too will be amazed at what is going on up there.  Somthing is in the wind.....;39.4192;-92.4366
