Orange soundless craft flying over Moberly, Mo.;2019-10-10 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Orange soundless craft flying over Moberly, Mo. My wife and I were helping my daughter move and hauling some of her belongings in Moberly, Missouri.  The  sighting occurred at approximately 2100 hrs.  We were South bound in town on Morley Street.  My asked me what that object was in the sky to the East.  I looked out the drivers side window and saw on orange craft/object.  It was stationary at first and had no blinking light nor making any sound.  We pulled over and it slowly began to move Northward and starting picking up speed.  Iâ€™m not sure how high it was but it was quite cloudy and started to rain about 15 minutes later.  My wife was able to take a short video on her phone.  She said it turned red at one point.  After it flew out of sight we continued to my daughters house approximately a half a mile away.  As we pulled up to here house we saw it once again near the same original location but traveling Northwest.  Not sure if this was the same object or another one, but it was also orange.  Not able to tell  how high it was or the size because it was nighttime.;39.4192;-92.4366
