AMBER LIGHTS SPOTTED IN FLORISSANT, MO;2012-11-03 23:00:00;2 minutes;AMBER LIGHTS SPOTTED IN FLORISSANT, MO Approximately 11:00 PM central time, I was driving north in Florissant, Missouri.  I looked east and saw what appeared to be 12 spherical, amber lights.  They were in no particular line or pattern and appeared to be stationary or extremely slow-moving and did not leave any sort of trail.  The objects were very small - probably the size of a Smart car and were no more than 1,000 feet off of the ground. I quickly turned around and started to head south to try and follow them, but they had already disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness and she struck us as being unusually eloquent and objective in her description of the event.  PD));38.7976394982086;-90.2888969175655
