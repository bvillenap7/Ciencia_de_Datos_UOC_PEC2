What I saw first was a very large bright oval shape light coming twords me from the S.E.At first, I thought it might be a airplane but the light was much brighter than any airplane I had ever seen before.So,I called for my son to come and join me outside as I thought he might know what type of aircraft it was.By the time he arived outside the object/craft was over our heads.Neither he nor I had any idea as to what type of aircraft it was.We live close to an airport , we hear and see many airplanes and jets but we have never seen anything like this before.The object was very large,prehaps two or three full moons in size. There was a large ,bright oval shape light on what appeared to be the frount of the object and several other lights forming what appeared to be a triangular shape craft. In the center of the object was a red light, none of the lights flashed.As I stated the object was very large but made little sound. However, the sound it did make was that of a soft humming.It wasnt untill the object was overhead that I/we heard a sound .It seemed to be grey or black in color,moving rather slowly for we were able to view it for about three min.It appeared to have a haze around it, prehaps due to the brightness of the frount light. It flew over our heads heading in a N.W. direction.We would very much like to know what it was we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the two witnesses on several occasions now, and they seem to be very good observers, and they seem quite insistent that what they witnessed on this night was not an aircraft.  They live not far from Lambert Field in St. Louis, and consequently, they are familiar with all types of commercial and military aircraft on approach to that airport.  Their two illustrations are not indicative of any type of aircraft that we are familiar with.  PD));38.7976394982086;-90.2888969175655
