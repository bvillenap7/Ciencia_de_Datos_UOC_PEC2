The night was extremely clear and a little brisk.;1987-12-15 21:15:00;10 minutes;The night was extremely clear and a little brisk. I live on a subdivision thruway. My son-in-law and his best friend and I had just loaded U-Haul of my daughter's stuff to go to Georgia were her family was stationed with the Army. Lambert Airport was about 8 miles away as the crow flies. At that time you could watch the planes lining up for landing in a cake pan pattern. So you could view  the planes circling St. LOUIS getting ready to land. Not any more because the trees have 40 years tree growth. Anyway, as we finished loading and drinking a beer a fleet of three groups of UFOs flew to the right of us in the Western sky about 2000 feet off the deck going hundreds of miles an hour with a black cloud behind them. They were V shaped. With two sided bright orange lights in a classic flock pattern. The cars in the street stopped on a dime and the occupants got out. The airport lit up like a Vesuvious Fountain. Our National Guard Unit filled the skies with every F 15 they had. They chased the fleet on a NNE glide path.  During those days I had a delivery route that encompassed the Airport. I used to watch the F 15 s takeoff. They used to take off Hot. They used minimum runway. Then they pulled to a 90°straight up position while doing a 360° spiral. Then they would fall on their back and seem to fall in the direction they wanted to go. Like a left turn. Then they would do a 180°to straighten out. Very impressive to see that is what those F 15 s did that night. One other aside. The best friend of my son-in-law was pretty shook up. He was Navy. He turned to me and said, I should not say this to you. I have seen a bunch of classified stuff. At sea we have shot a lot of missiles off at the Korean Peninsula and sent a lot of jets in war games. I have seen a lot. I have never seen anything like this. The next day the radio reported that a Russion sattelite flew over St. LOUIS and landed in Oklahoma. That is exactly the opposite direction of this event.;38.7976394982086;-90.2888969175655
