It seemed to appear from nowhere and disappear just as quickly. Elevation was rather low, about cloud level. At about 21:30 on the 4th of July several of us saw a bluish/green light just streak across the sky. It was only visible for 1 to 2 seconds but was moving very fast from an east to west direction. It appeared that the elevation was only about cloud high. It was moving so fast it was difficult to get a shape but reminded me of a tip of a flame from an aircraft engine. However, this was moving much too fast to be an aircraft and we did not hear any noise. The observers were a family group. Males and females, ages 18 to 45.;38.7976394982086;-90.2888969175655

Unidentified green light.;2011-06-02 23:00:00;12 seconds;Unidentified green light. I am writing this message because I made another report yesterday afternoon.  I have since reviewed my instant messenger conversation log and realized I made a mistake about the time and date the sighting occurred.  It occurred on June 2, 2011 around 23:00 and it was traveling in a Northerly direction.   Also to add a note about the color of green it was green like a stop light green light.  The object also made no sound whatsoever.   My father used to work for TWA airlines and he said that in the area this happened there would be no aircraft with green lights.  He also said they would not be from a helicopter either. Here is my original message for reference so you can update your records:    Hello, I live in Florissant Mo, about two weeks ago,  I was walking up to the mcdonalds on lindberg ave.  I saw a solid green light in the sky that appeared to move slow and looked like it could not be more then 100 feet in the air.  It looked like it was moving maybe 15 mph i mean pretty slow.  I saw the light for maybe 10 seconds and then it curved upward the light started moving really really fast for about two seconds while moving upwards and then just dissappeared.   I did not report it to the police because they would likely not take it seriously.  Anyway that is what I saw. ((ORIGINAL REPORT APPENDED HERE)) Low flying green light over Florissant, Missouri.
