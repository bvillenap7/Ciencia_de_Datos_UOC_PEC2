Object with bright  lights in a circle formation hovers over a residential area;2008-04-10 21:45:00;2min;Object with bright  lights in a circle formation hovers over a residential area I was laying in my bed with the blinds slightly open, and at approximately 09:45pm I noticed very bright lights that were a white color. I went to the window and saw an object with 5 bright lights in a circular formation. The object was about as high as a helicopter would be flying. It was soundless, and it remained still and moved slightly up and down. The object then drifted away at a fast speed and a never moved in straight line, as a plane or some other aircraft would. Approximatley 1 min later I saw an airplane flying in the same vicinity where the object was and head in the same direction. I was very leary about reporting this,  because I really am not sure what I saw, but I know it was not an airplane or any other craft that would be common. I have never seen anything like it and I'm really shocked.;38.7976394982086;-90.2888969175655
