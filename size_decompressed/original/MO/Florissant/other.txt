On May 11, 2009 at 8:11pm I was standing on my front balcony looking due East. I observed a large passenger jetplane ascending toward the clouds.  I quickly decided to take a picture before it got out of sight.  I looked into the viewfinder and was about to snap the shutter, a dark round object suddenly appeared below the clouds.  It was already in a downward speeding motion toward the jet.  It pursued the jet from its rear at great speed.It maintained an elevated height to the jet's tail.  The plane was moving very fast.  The object was moving faster but slowed when it matched the jets speed.  I released the shutter stunned and then ran to my computer to see if I caught the object in the picture.  I did. I believe it to be from the same group of objects I had seen and photographed the day before.;38.7976394982086;-90.2888969175655
Bright red bigger light with tail of smaller dimmer white lights. Dragon-fly. Unidentified &quotfloating&quot object?;2017-07-04 21:00:00;5 minutes+;Bright red bigger light with tail of smaller dimmer white lights. Dragon-fly. Unidentified &quotfloating&quot object? Saw a big bright red light with a straight line of smaller white lights behind it.  It held a perfectly straight line for quite a while and perfectly still in place.  Finally moved and the white lights slowly flexed as if in a breeze.  It was as if it pivoted with the red light as the head.  It made no sound we had the sunroof of the car open and watched it for five minutes, and yes it is the fourth of July.  I would have said it was a helicopter but no sound, it was low enough to see each white light in line, also eventually y the “tail” blew as if a dog tail waging in slow motion.  It was as if it were some kind of a kite, but it did not move at all for the longest time and the tail was perfectly straight for for most of the time.  The white lights appeared to be on the same flat plane as the red light. parallel with the ground.  “A dragon-fly” is how my wife and I both described it.  Seemed to be over City Hall.   It was not a firework, but a stationary object.;38.7976394982086;-90.2888969175655
