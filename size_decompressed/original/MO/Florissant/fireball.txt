Hovering fireball object in the sky;2009-09-12 20:33:00;5 MINUTES;Hovering fireball object in the sky My husband and I were on our way home In Florissant Missouri and I saw a bright orange light which put you in the mind of a fireball it was hovering over a building and I said to my husband  (What is that?) So we pulled into a parking lot and watched it go upward. We then began to drive in the direction the object was moving and it steady went up into the sky and then the lights went out. There was no noise from this object it was very quiet and moved steady but quickly. The next morning we found out we were not the only ones that saw this so that was a relief to know we were not just seeing things. If anyone else saw this, please post.

Fireball over St. Louis, MO July 4th;2012-07-04 23:05:00;1-2 minutes;Fireball over St. Louis, MO July 4th On the 4th of July 2012, 4 adults and 2 teenage children were sitting on our back porch talking at       11:05 pm after the holiday celebration, when I noticed a fireball type craft flying in the sky horizontally from southeast to northwest, from Ferguson, MO to St. Charles, MO or Alton, IL area.  Once I pointed it out to the others they all saw it too.  It flew slowly and the path it flew was straight, but did vary every so often and go up or down slightly, it flew over us and continued on until it was out of our sight, descending slightly the further it went. The size of the fireball type craft was approximately   1/8 to ¼ the size of the moon as we see it on earth.  The craft seemed rather jagged like it was on fire.  It didn’t appear to have a shape other than a jagged ball. It was not close to us but was easily visible.  The craft made no noise, as the planes etc. we see often in our area do.  It was very deep reddish orange. This is the second craft I have seen in this general area.   July 4th 1997 I saw a very large craft over Hwy 370 near St. Charles MO, as did thousands of other fireworks watchers.;38.7976394982086;-90.2888969175655
Orange fireballs in a diamond/trapezoid shape between Central Parkway and Humes Lane in Florissant, MO;2013-05-04 20:30:00;~5 minutes;Orange fireballs in a diamond/trapezoid shape between Central Parkway and Humes Lane in Florissant, MO My husband, son and his girlfriend and I were visiting my mom's house in Florissant, MO, (between Central Parkway and Humes Lane) and she was outside having a cigarette when she noticed a set of approximately 6 orange colored lights in a large diamond/trapezoid shape in the sky, above the tree line, moving towards the west. She yelled for all of us to come outside to look.  There were two sets of 6 lights, one after the other and they faded and disappeared and never reappeared (like as if they had passed behind a cloud or something) after approximately 4-5 mins.  They were there and then gone. I was not able to look at them through binoculars or take a picture, we were too busy just watching them. My husband is 37. my son and his girlfriend are 17 and 16 and my mom and her husband are 55 and 51. I am 36.  None of us were under the influence of alcohol or drugs when we saw these lights.;38.7976394982086;-90.2888969175655
Big bright red-orange object flying horizontally at about 5000ft-10000ft rotating slightly as it moved Northeast.;2016-08-01 23:04:00;20 seconds;Big bright red-orange object flying horizontally at about 5000ft-10000ft rotating slightly as it moved Northeast. As I pulled up to my house, I seen a bright red-orange ball of light flying in the sky going Northwest over my house.  I ran inside my house and yelled UFO! UFO!   My mom jumped up from the couch and stood next to me as we watched the luminous object move pretty swiftly across the sky.   I ran in my parents bedroom and retrieved my dad and my brother and by the time we got outside to get a better look the craft was almost out of sight and flew behind our tree and finally over the cloud cover.  It covered a vast distance in about 20 seconds of time and was high enough in the air to go above the clouds.    The creepy party about it was that once it flew behind the clouds we could still see location of the object as the red glow could be seen through the clouds for a few more seconds.   The object almost seemed to be rotating as it moved across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
