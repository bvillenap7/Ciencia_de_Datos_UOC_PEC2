Was traveling South on RtC In Callaway County. Wife saw multi-colored lights in a crescent shape high in the Western sky. Object disappeared after 5 seconds. Was impossible to tell which direction it was going due to brief duration. It was a clear night, our windows were down which eliminated the possibility of reflected light. I did not see it as I was too busy driving a curvy deer laden road.;38.8513;-91.9604
