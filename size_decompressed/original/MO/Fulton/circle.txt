One of the objects came from the north east and was moving at a moderate speed and had colored lights on it, the other one was coming from the west and moving to the east and it was also moving fairly slowly, the one that was coming from the nort east just kinda vanised or we lost track of it and the other one stoped and hovered for about 1.5 hours and the lights were changing colors from like a bright blue to green and red and it was moving slowly away from us at an south easterly direction, there was about 6 that seen it hovering and one that seen them moving at 1st but i have been around for awile and have never seen anything like it before, they also did not make any noise if it had been aircraft as i know them we would have heard something but there was nothing ((NUFORC Note:  Except for the objects' motion, the description seems to us to be reminiscent of twinkling stars.  However, a twinkling star is seen to move across the sky with all other heavenly bodies as the earth turns on its axis.  PD));38.8513;-91.9604
