I looked out over what was a large field at that time in the direction of the Fulton water tower.  It is a very large and distinctive tower and was about a quarter mile from my location.  It was still daytime, but clear and cold.  I saw a diamond shaped light in the sky off to the east.  I saw it go behind ther water tower, and slowly travel in a southerly direction.  It oscillated in a golden orange color.  I have never forgoten that incident.  I have told some close friends, but never my parents.;38.8513;-91.9604
