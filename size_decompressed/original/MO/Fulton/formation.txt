Formation of lights in the sky over Millersburg.;2012-09-29 18:45:00;1.30 seconds;Formation of lights in the sky over Millersburg. While returning from a church event, my husband and I saw this formation of 11 lights in the sky in front of us.  It seemed to be in the shape of a diamond.  We watched and parked quickly in a near-by parking lot to watch and they just disappeared, except for two lights that seemed to stay a while longer.  It appeared that they just suddenly went higher in the sky and went out of sight.  There was no sound.  I was able to count 11 lights, but there could have been more.  I called local TV station to see if anyone else saw them.  At that time they had not.  There were no strobe lights like a plane would have and no sound like a helicopter and they were much too high it appeared fot that.  We do not think they could possibly been 11 aircraft there and with no sound.....????;38.8513;-91.9604
