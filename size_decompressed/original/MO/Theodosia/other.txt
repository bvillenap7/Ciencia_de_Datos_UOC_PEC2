IT WAS AN OVERCAST MORNING WITH NO WIND.  MY FATHER AND I WERE FISHING ON THE LAKE WHEN I HAD THE SUDDEN URGE TO LOOK UP INTO THE SKY.  FOR A BRIEF PERIOD I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A FLYING OBJECT I HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF.  I EXCITEDLY TOLD MY DAD TO LOOK UP.   WHAT WE SAW REMINDED ME OF A ONE WAY STREET SIGN ONLY POINTING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.  ONE SIDE HAD A BIGGER ARROW THE OTHER A SMALLER ARROW.  IT WAS WHITE IN COLOR AND IN THE MIDDLE WERE THREE SMALLER BLACK RECTANGLES IN A ROW.   IT WAS MOVING SOUTH VERY SLOWLY  AND MADE NO NOISE.  THE END WITH THE SMALLER ARROW SEEMED TO BE THE FRONT.  WE SAW IT FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS BEFORE IT WENT BEHIND THE CLOUDS.  IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE GROUND I WOULD SAY 300-500FT.
