It floated across our faces a amber fiery ball of light & the brightness stayed the same from the time we seen it until it was out of site. It floated silently, very silently but very bright across our yard& then it got towards adjoining neighbors yard back  property line & the speed accelerated &zoomed away into the dark Franklin County skies& appeared to look like a star in! the sky. This is just 1 of the many sightings I have seen here. I am so curious if anyone else in this area has seen anything like this around here especially on 7-3-11?
