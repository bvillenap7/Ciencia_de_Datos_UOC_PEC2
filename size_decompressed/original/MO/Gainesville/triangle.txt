An hovered object in the sky.;2015-10-12 19:00:00;19:00;An Hovered Object In The Sky. This event happened on 10-12-2015.  This happened about a month after I seen the Triangle sighting.  Between 7:30 pm & 8 Pm. I seen an large object in the west on the outside a little ways from our town.  It seemed to Hover for like seemed 5 minutes or less. I seen planes go over around the same time. As soon as I started walking this Object started flying over this direction. It looked like it had lots of lights. Kind of lit up the sky.  Looked like from what I seen it looked to be all White Lights. No flashing.  As it was flying above me. I noticed it had no sound. And it looked like it could of been another Triangle shape Object.  It was flying over our building and another house behind us and above the trees. I went back in the apartment. And came back out and My boyfriend said. Something else had gone over. And he didn't know what it was. I took a picture of it. All I got was the lights. But will send it anyways.  And it was flying the same direction as the other thing I had seen in the sky.;36.5866;-92.4185
My boyfriend and I have been seen an Object North of us.;2016-02-19 18:30:00;5 minutes;My Boyfriend and I have been seen an Object North of us. There is Fields and cattle that direction. We see this object off and on for a while now. It appears to be triangle shaped.  It has no sound. We watched it ascend.  Far distance it will look almost like a star. But it's big and bright. Last week as we was watching it.  While it was Ascending. Traffic was coming down the road. The object turned it's lights out.  As if it was only meant for us to see it. And we didn't see it again.  That night.  I'm sure we will see it again. I have photo's of it.;36.5866;-92.4185
