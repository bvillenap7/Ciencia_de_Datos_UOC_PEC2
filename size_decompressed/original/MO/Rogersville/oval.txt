Oblong silver oval in northern sky.;2015-04-24 14:00:00;a few seconds;Oblong silver oval in northern sky. I have seen this same object twice, but not in the same location.  The first was afternoon time in the northern sky.  I happened to look up and see a silver/metallic oblong oval shape sitting in the air very high up.  It seemed to fold into itself and disappear in the blink of an eye.I know it was sometime in the spring but do not know exact date.  The second time I saw this I was driving west and looked up and the exact same thing happened.  It seemed to fold into itself and disappear.  It happened to fast to take a picture.
