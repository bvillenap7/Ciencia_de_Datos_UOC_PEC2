Standing in peoples creek park overlooking the lake.  At about 4:30 or 5:00 am.  I heard a noise that sounded like a jet fighter circling around the lake.   I moved around too see a opening in the tree's.  There about only 300 yards away, and half a mile high was a circle shaped object.  It was lit up with lights.   It looked to be moving about  40 - 50 miles per hour.  And about 80 yards in diameter.  It wasn't making a sound.  I then realized the sound was coming from 1 or two jet fighter's.  I couldn't see the jets, but I came too this conclusion cause I've heard fighter jets before.  And it sounded like as this object was kinda floating above the lake approximately 50 miles an hour the fighter jets were staying way above it circling.   At first glance it looked to be cigar shaped.  But I am sure it was round.  From the positioning of the lights.  The lights were only one color.  Like if you had a dimmer switch and had all the lights turned down really low.   Then it disappeared, like it shut its lights off.  But I could still hear the jets circling.   I am thinking it took 20 minutes to where I couldn't hear the jets anymore.   PS.  Although the jets were staying with this aircraft they were I am guessing keeping a 20 mile circle around it.  I swear by this statement.;36.9385;-90.27
