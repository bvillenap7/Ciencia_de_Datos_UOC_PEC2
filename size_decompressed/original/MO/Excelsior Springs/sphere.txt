I was on my way home from work and about a mile from my destination when a light caught my attention on my right.    All of a sudden my radio went dead and I glanced down at it to see what happened.  When I looked back up at the light a chill ran down my spine.   I still don't know what it was, but it scared me and I stopped my truck to look at it.  I don't know why I did this because I was so scared that I couldn't move.  It was above the field next to my truck.   It was a sphere that was glowing a blueish-pink and it was moving real slow.  I could hear this intense humming that I assume was coming from the object.   Then a beam came out of the bottom of it and it almost looked like it was searching for something.   The beam was just kind of combing the ground to the left and right below the object.   I decided to get out of my truck and look at it closer, but when I opened the door the beam went out and it stopped so I got back into my truck.   All of a sudden it just shot straight up into the sky and just kind of disappeared from the inside out.   When it disappeared my radio came on full blast and my windshield wipers turned on on high.   I was so scared that I drove the rest of the way home as fast as I possibly could and ended up sitting in my truck in the driveway for about 2 hours because I was scared to get out of my truck and go into the house.   Like I said, I still don't know what it was, but I do know that I never want to see it again.;39.3394;-94.229
