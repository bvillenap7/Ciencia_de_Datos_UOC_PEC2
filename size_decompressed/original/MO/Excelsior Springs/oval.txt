A large, white, wingless object sped across the sky;2002-10-04 13:18:00;1 minute;A large, white, wingless object sped across the sky My buddy and I were outside getting some tools from our truck when I heard him say, Look at that.   I looked to where he was indicating, and saw a white stubby looking object traveling across the sky to the west of us in a northerly direction.  I asked him if he could see any wings or tail and he said no. Neither could I.   As we watched, the craft maintained its course at a very rapid rate of speed.  It soon moved beyond our sight as it passed behind a cloud.   While wondering what we had seen, and what its actual size had been, my friend spotted a commercial airliner at approximately the same altitude.  We could see that the airliner was quite thinner, a little longer, and had obvious wings and a tail.   The sky was dotted with white clouds that day and the object was visible to us for less than a minute before we lost sight of it.;39.3394;-94.229
