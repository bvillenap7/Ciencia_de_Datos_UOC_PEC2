I was out in the late evening bird watching and plane watching with binoculars.  The approximate time was 19:50 hrs., April 10, 2010, just before sunset.  I believe I witnessed a collision of satellites, or something entering the earthâ€™s atmosphere and breaking up.   At first I thought it was a bright star or the ISS, but it broke into two distinct parts with a debris field behind it.  The objects did not seem to be falling.  It was not moving like the ISS and did not streak across the sky like a meteor.   The two distinct pieces slowly drifted apart.  After a couple of minutes one of the pieces broke into two more pieces.  Those also slowly drifted apart.   After sunset the light was failing and I lost sight of the objects.   I observed the objects/pieces for about 15 minutes, maybe a little longer.;39.3394;-94.229
