Bright green cigar shaped with bright flashing light;1998-07-25 20:00:00;1  min;Bright green cigar shaped with bright flashing light This happend about ten years ago in Missouri but I remember the UFO like yesterday.  Me and some friends of mine were walking to my house when we saw a bright flashing white light coming from behind some trees.  We thought someone was taking pictures.  We stood there confused. Then this long bright neon green object with a flashing light was coming toward us.  It was about 40 feet above us and going about 3 miles an hour.  The guys I was with were not freaking out as bad as us girls. We were crying we were so scared.  The objects light was so bright it lite up the area like it was day light.  I was to scared to watch it for to long.  My friend and I ran to my house that was 100 feet away. I told my parents I dont remember what they said.  The next day my friends mom said she saw it to. She said it took off so fast and was gone. None of us ever talked about it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));38.9483;-90.9121
