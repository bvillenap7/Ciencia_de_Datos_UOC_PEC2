We were outside Bar B Qing and husband happened to look up and said What the hell is that? My daughter and I said, What? He said THAT and pointed. Then we saw what he saw. It was a round silver matalic color at first and then it turned bright yellow. Not sure if it was lit up like a fireball or if it was just reflecting the sunlight. It traveled very slowly from Northwest to Southeast. It went behind a cloud but you could still see the yellow shining through. It then came out of the clouds and continued in the same direction that it had been moving..still very slowly. The Bar B Q was done at about 7:18 pm so we brought it in the house. I then went out the front door and saw the object still slowly moving to the Southeast. I then came in and ate and went back outside but it was gone by then.;38.6975999999996;-90.3604000000036
