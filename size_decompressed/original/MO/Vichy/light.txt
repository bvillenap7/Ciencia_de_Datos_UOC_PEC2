Small Red Light at Car Level;2013-07-29 20:30:00;3 seconds;Small Red Light at Car Level First off, let me state that time was somewhere between 8:30PM and 8:45PM and the location was on US 63 between the towns of Vichy and Vienna in Maries County, Missouri.  I was driving north on US 63 towards Vienna driving about 65 MPH.  I glanced in my driver's door mirror when I saw a small, round red light traveling a few inches below mirror level in the opposite direction that I was driving.  From my best estimate, the object was about one or two feet away from my car.  I would guess the object to be about the size of a JFK half dollar or an Eisenhower dollar from my perspective. There were no other cars or motorcycles in sight in front or behind me so I ruled out a tail light reflection in the mirror or someone tossing a cigarette butt out of their car. I did not experience any strange feelings, communication or time loss at all.  *Please feel free to contact me in so desired*;38.0971;-91.78
