I hear his drummer say would you look at that, as i looked up i saw a large triangle shaped craft flying from northeast to southwest. It was shaped like a triangle with a nose on it. I could see four lights on the nose, one on the very tip one on each side of the nose and one slightly back. It also had one light in the middle one on what i would call the tail end and one on each wingtip. The lights on the nose and the one in the middle of the craft were the only ones blinking. All lights looked to be red in color except the four on the nose which appeared to be yellow in color. I would have to say it looked as big as a quarter held at arms length, and looked to be moveing very slowly for as big as it appeared.;40.0777;-93.6033
