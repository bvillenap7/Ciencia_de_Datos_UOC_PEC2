strobing light, changing colors - red, orange and blue,  30 deg above horizon, stationary.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Sirius.  PD));2011-09-13 04:20:00;1 hr;strobing light, changing colors - red, orange and blue,  30 deg above horizon, stationary. At 4:20 AM on September 13th 2011  We were camping when my friend called me outside to see something.  There was a flashing light, completely stationary, in the sky at about 30 degrees above skyline, directly under Orions Belt.  It was flashing extremely rapidly and changing colors every flash with no discernible pattern. The colors it made where red, blue, and orange.  The flashes were very rapid, and seemingly random, although they always came very quickly.  We watched it for almost fifteen minutes and seeing no movement, went back into the tent and looked on the internet to see if anyone else had seen something like it.  We found several reports, some from as far back as 1998 of a quickly flashing object in the same place and most of the reports had the same colors as the one we saw.  We continued checking up on the object for about an hour, it never moved and it started getting dimmer by the end of the hour, eventually looking like a normal star and finally fading from the sky.;37.7504;-90.5968
4 orange lights floating in the west without  blinking or losing their place as if hovering.;2017-12-09 22:00:00;Several minutes;4 orange lights floating in the west without  blinking or losing their place as if hovering. We saw 4 orange redish lights hovering without blinking in the distance, west of our front yard.  It appeared as if they were simply floating in place, but after a few minutes, they appeared to be getting smaller, as if they were flying west.  3 were flying in an irregular triangle formation and the 4th was a little ways off in the sky a little more northwest but exhibiting the same behavior.   My roommate depicted it as possible army helicopters, or something similar, so we returned outside.;37.7504;-90.5968
