Moon shaped object in western sky glowing orange;2009-08-01 01:15:00;30-45 minutes;Moon shaped object in western sky glowing orange On the morning of August 1st, I had just finished watching a movie with my daughter and was getting ready for bed.  The time was approximately 1:30 am.  I climbed in bed and closed my eyes, when I noticed a bright light coming from the west.  My bed is beneath 3 large windows facing south.  The light was shining on the blinds and looked as if it were car headlights.  I moved the blinds slightly to see if I could get a better look, and was only able to see a bright orange circular light, behind the trees.  To be honest it looked like what we would call a harvest moon.  It seemed odd coming from that direction at that time of morning.   I got up and went to look out of other windows that I may have a better view of the light and possibly the source.  I finally went into a bedroom facing west and looked out the window and saw the bright “moon” in the sky.  A new cell phone tower had just been put up in town.  The light seemed to be behind it somewhere.   I went back to bed telling myself it must be the actual moon, not really believing it.  The light lasted for about 30-45 minutes and then as quickly as it had appeared, it was gone.  I did not see it leave or how it moved.  I heard no noise.  I just noticed the light was gone from my window.  I have waited for it to return, but it has never been back.  If it returns, I will be getting pictures and video.;37.7504;-90.5968
