The object then moved vertically and disappeared. On the 27th of August 1999, my brother and I were traveling westbound on I70. My brother first noticed a light in the western sky. He turned and asked me what it was. He had been observing this light for approximately 30 seconds before I saw the same light. We both then observed this light from approximately 1950 to 2000 hrs. During this time the object or light remained suspended. It looked to be 10,000 to 15,000 feet in the air. We noticed that the object seem to have a black line that ran vertical through 3/4 of the length of the object. The object had a distinctive steady yellowish orange light. At approximately 2000 hrs. it then begin to move slowly in a vertical direction. It took approximately 3 to 5 seconds before it disappeared completely. The movement that was observed was very fluid.;38.9524;-92.7471
