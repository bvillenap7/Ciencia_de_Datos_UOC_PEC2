Craft was spotted in the summer night sky.;1997-07-02 23:30:00;30 minutes;A craft was spotted in the summer night sky.  I was inside a house, and a bright light was seen with my peripheral vision though the window.  I looked out the window to see the object better, and then went outside for an even closer look.  I saw a bright white light in the shape of a sphere.  The object was just below a thin layer of clouds with a full moon above.  The object would move around a small area with high speed and maneuverability.  Several times the craft would shoot straight up into the atmosphere until it was out of sight and then return to the same location below the clouds.  This occurred several times.  If an airplane came into view the light would disappear until the plane was out of sight.  The craft was visible for at least 30 minutes.  I went inside the house to get a 35mm camera.  However, I was not able to get the camera to focus on the object so that a picture to be taken. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));38.9524;-92.7471
