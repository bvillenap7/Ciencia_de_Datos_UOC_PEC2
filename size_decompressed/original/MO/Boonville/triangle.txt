Low flying Triangle craft with Blue and White lights on each corner near Booneville, Missouri over Hwy. 70;2017-09-09 22:00:00;Seconds;Low flying Triangle craft with Blue and White lights on each corner near Booneville, Missouri, over Hwy. 70 We were traveling East on Hwy 70 around the 100 to 106 Mile Marker.  We were in the passing lane, when the craft came across both lanes (from the North) at a very very low altitude (Just above the tree line).  We all look and our first thought was a Drone, as we own one, but then quickly realized the size was too large for a drone.  It was triangle in shape with three lights, one at each corner that was the color of white and blue.  The craft climbed altitude quickly in a southward direction.  We were able to see the craft for several minutes.  I immediately downloaded a flight tracker app and opened, but no crafts matched the location and path.  I also checked the stats for take offs at the closest airport in Booneville, MO, but on airplanes were reported at that facility for the date and time.;38.9524;-92.7471
