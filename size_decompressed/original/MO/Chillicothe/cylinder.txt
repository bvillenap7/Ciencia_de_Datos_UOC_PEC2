I was with family as we were driving between Columbia and Chillicothe.  I was sitting in the right backseat looking through the window into the clear blue sky when I suddenly spotted two objects that were pretty distant from each other in height.  I could tell that the lower one was a jet because of its trailing contrail.  The other object however, did not have one, and was white with a cylindrical shape and seemed to move slower than that of a jet flying at the same height. As both were flying opposite directions out of my feild of view, two more objects had suddenly popped into view and this time they were the same cylindrical shape, color, and altitude but were a few miles apart traveling in the same direction.  As time went on I started to see more appear but not one right after the other. The lowest flying object had appeared as we were driving through Chillicothe.  It was flying very low, maybe between one and two thousand feet.  I couldn't get the clearest view of the underside of the thing but it had the cylindrical shape and white color to its body and as it flew over head I caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a red sphere on the right side of its undercarriage and a black sphere on the left side.  I lost sight of it as we were going the opposite direction. In total, between 12pm and 2pm I saw 16 objects, and from what I could tell only 3 of them even remotely resembeled aircraft.  I've seen eight jets in one day fly over head before but never in my life have I seen 13 white, cylindrical objects flying around in the sky.;39.8047;-93.5544
