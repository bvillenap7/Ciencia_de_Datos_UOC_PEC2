We both saw a circular glowing shape burning into the atmosphere.  we yelled for our mom to come look and she did too.  it seemed to be breaking up as well.  it started off as a deep purple slowly changing into orange and yellow.   it continued to change and break up until it dissapeared.  we couldnt figure out what it was.. and the fact that it was so well seen.  anyone who was looking up at the sky at that moment in the area would have seen it.  it was on the westerly side of the sky. later that night we watched the news.. and they had an extremely small two sentences to say about it.  someone had caught it on video..  and the news anchor said it was space trash  but there were no details.  it sounded to me like no one really knew and they didnt want anyone to know about it. it definetely was one of the weirdest things i have ever seen.
