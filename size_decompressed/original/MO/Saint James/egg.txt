Bright orange egg shaped lights shining in my windows.;2017-04-14 22:00:00;All Night;Bright orange egg shaped lights shining in my windows. For the last month there have been green, red, white, orange and sometimes blue lights shining in my bedroom window after dark and especially while I am sleeping.  These lights can be blinding at times.  Each week there seems to be more and more of them. Recently while driving home from a friends house a orange egg shaped bright light about the size of a plate or larger came flying up to the tail end of the car from the field and stayed along side the car for a couple of miles.  It was so close you could see the light reflecting off the back.   Soon after, a green one appeared, following the orange light.   We began driving faster and then the lights came to a sudden stop at a four way on some gravel roads and just sat there like they were looking at us.   These lights shine every window in my house each night while everyone is trying to sleep and it is starting to keep my children awake and scare them.;38.0047;-91.5975
