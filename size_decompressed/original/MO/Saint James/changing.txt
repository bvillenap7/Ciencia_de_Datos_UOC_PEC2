Unidentified object in the St.James Mo area.;2004-08-26 19:35:00;approx 8 min.;Unidentified object in the St.James Mo area. My dad and i were driving home.  It was still pretty light out and the sky was very clear.  We clearly saw an object in the sky.  It was a long oval shape with a sort of tail on it.  It didn't appear to move at all but it appeared to be getting smaller....possibly moving further away....west.   It was an orange/yellow color. The tail disappeared and the object appeared to be just a circle of orange/yellow.  Then eventually we lost sight of it.;38.0047;-91.5975
