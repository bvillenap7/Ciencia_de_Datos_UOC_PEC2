Hovering triangular shaped aircraft.;2017-11-07 19:35:00;35 minutes;Hovering triangular shaped aircraft My husband was leaving our home for some evening errands.  He spotted the craft hovering over neighbor's yard.  When he got back about 30 minutes later the craft was still in the same spot.  He quickly came in the house and told me to come outside and look at the sky.  When i walked into the back yard i saw a craft with red and white lights hovering.  I imediately said, It's a drone babe.  He said, No it's not.  It's too big to be a drone.   We watched it for a couple of minutes then it began to move toward us.  As it flew over our heads, we could tell it had three red and white lights, one in each corner.  It was making a sound unlike a helicopter or jet.  It sounded more like an 18 wheeler truck.  It was moving slowly at first then faster while raising in altitude.  After it passed us, it seemed to disapear or the lights went out or something.;37.8498;-90.4885
