UFO Sighting  At first my father saw a flash in the sky.  Only thinking it was a falling star he watched longer and it appeared to be a red-ish flame in an electrical ball that ran across the sky.  It was on the edge of the little town we live in.  It seemed to be fairly close to us.   After looking at the object for a longer time, the ball looked like it conducted electricity and had sparks in the inside. It only lasted a couple of minutes than it disappeared.   My father then came running inside saying he saw the same object in the sky as he did last year in the same town during summer. Him, his girlfriend and I walked back outside to see what was going on.  In the far distance there was a blue object hovering in the sky as my dad called it, The Mother ship.   The object looked flat and was tinted blue.  His girlfriend pointed out the UFO had blue lights all around it and just the bottom part was spinning around.  I noticed it too after a while.  The lights underneath the aircraft were blue also, but disappeared every now and then.  We could not tell how far the aircraft was but it was right beside another light.  To me it looked like a light tower or a service pole.  This is not the only time we have spotted this or another kind of strange object in the sky around our small county.;40.5362;-95.3104
