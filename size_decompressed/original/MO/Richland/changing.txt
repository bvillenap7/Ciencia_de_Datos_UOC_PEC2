Me and my family and friends are camping rite now.  I do not know the zipcode since I've never been here before.  My friend and I looked at the sky and two almost circular shaped things were in the sky pretty high and clearly not an airplane.  They are still there rite now. they look orange and red and yellow.  A few minutes ago another one weirdly popped out of nowhere. The colors on each craft seemed to oddly spread and then go back to normal.  As I'm writing this the crafts are gone now... my friend jus looked at the sky and told me there not there anymore.  I'm not joking I swear.  I don't know if it was ufos but its clearly a big possibility.  My friend and I are 15 years old and the other people here are drunk adults so the other 8 witnesses won't be good.  They were just looking at the sky laughing and saying it was probably weather balloons.;37.8503;-92.3926
