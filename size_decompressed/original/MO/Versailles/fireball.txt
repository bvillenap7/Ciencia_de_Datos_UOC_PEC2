Yellow/Orange colored orb seen for approximately 30 minutes.;2013-10-21 19:20:00;25-30 minutes;Yellow/Orange colored orb seen for approximately 30 minutes I flash of light outside the window caught my attention.  In the southwestern sky I saw what appeared to be a very bright, larger than normal yellow/orange star.   It was a solid brightness, no flashes as one would see on a typical aircraft.  It seemed to hover in the distance moving only slightly.   After about 7 minutes, a second star appeared however, it dipped behind trees and I was not able to see it.  This second object appeared at least two more times in the course of 15 - 20 minutes.   Just before the object disappeared, it seemed to separate into 3 different orange-colored orbs and disappeared.;38.4365;-92.8258
