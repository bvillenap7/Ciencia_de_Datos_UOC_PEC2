String of white lights across morning Missouri sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-24 05:55:00;5-10 minutes;String of white lights across morning Missouri sky Warren County Missouri 5:55 AM on Sunday November 24th.  While preparing to deer hunt, two hunters noticed a string of bright lights in the Northern part of the sky moving from the West to Northeast.  The string of lights were in a straight line and evenly spaced for the most part and crossed the entire early morning sky.  Itâ€™s difficult to estimate the number of total lights observed but was close to one hundred.  Occasionally a second light would parallel the string of lights slightly above the string but at the identical pace.  The lights lasted for five to ten minutes after first being observed.  As the sun began to rise the lights became fainter but finished crossing the sky prior to sunrise.  The lights were very high in the sky and reminded me of when a satellite or the space station goes by.;38.6494;-91.1563000000001
