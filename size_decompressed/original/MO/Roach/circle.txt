Large bright light with blue hue;2019-07-18 19:45:00;Seconds;Large bright light with blue hue My boyfriend and I were grilling dinner on the back deck at my parents house. The sun was just about to set so it was still a light blue and no clouds at all in the sky. We have a nice view of the water and a pretty open view of the sky. We are sitting there when we see this huge glowing light with a blue hue zoom past us at an incredible speed. We were both speechless then I ran inside to tell my parents and they brushed it off like a shooting star. I’ve seen plenty of shooting stars it was way to low and to big and trailed for way to long (until it was out of out sites) to be a shooting star. Even talking about it later we both had the hairs on our neck stand up and both anticipated the sound of a crash but nothing ever happened. My mom has a local business and has a lady she sees regularly that takes phone calls at the police station. A lot of other people saw the same thing. So crazy. I never really thought we were alone but now I’m convinced. I’m glad t! here’s a place people like me can write their stories.;38.1051;-92.9188
