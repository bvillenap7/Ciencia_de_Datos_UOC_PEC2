Unexplained Circular Fireball;2011-07-27 21:45:00;6 seconds;Unexplained Circular Fireball On the way home from work I crested the hill as I pulled into my driveway and I saw a fireball, orange and reddish in coloration, at around 9:45 it was 900-2000 feet above the ground. I t was approximately 75-100 feet in diameter and for a split second I wrote it off as a firework dwindling out but it didn't dwindle, rather it changed shape just slightly (it was always oblong spherical in shape) and a small piece came off and moved slightly right of the object 15-20 feet (all distances and measurements may be skewed but they are what I perceived from my location) the small piece dwindled (went from visible to gone in 3/4 of a sec) and 1 ½ seconds after the larger object followed suit.  The object did not gain or lose altitude nor did it move side to side besides the small piece that came from the original object.  This ball was visible when I crested the hill so it’s possible it was there longer but I personally experienced it for 5.5 to 7 seconds (hard to tell! because I was just baffled and a bit thrown off when it didn’t dwindle like a firework would).;38.1051;-92.9188
