Three bright orange lights go from horizon to horizon almost directly overhead.;2014-08-10 21:00:00;3 minutes;Three bright orange lights go from horizon to horizon almost directly overhead I went out side with my 8 year old daughter at about 9:00 p.m., 8/11/2014, to look at the supermoon.  I looked up and saw a very bright red light moving from north to south over the house.   I told my daughter to look at the airplane.  It was moving across the sky directly overhead very fast. I looked like the speed of a low flying aircraft, but was not low.   I watched for a minute then noticed another following it, and then another.  They were all in a line and quite a ways behind each other.   All took the same path.  I would guess it to be at 10,000 feet and extremely bright orange.  There was fairly heavy clouds cover to the south, and they disappeared behind the clouds before reaching the horizon.  I thought they were below the clouds due them being as bright as they were.  I watched them until they disappeared in the clouds in the southern sky.   My wife was in the front of the house and asked me if I had seen them.  She said they looked like flares shooting out of the ground! when she first saw them.  I would agree that it had the color and brightness of a flare.  It flew like an extremely fast aircraft, but I never heard a sound.  The brightness of the orange light, the speed by which they moved, and the lack of any audible noise struck me as odd.   I have never seen anything quite like this. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) You are correct. It was the 10th, at about 21:00.  National Weather Service shows skies were broken with clouds around 7,000-10,000 feet.  ((END ADDENDUM));38.6419;-94.3285000000001
