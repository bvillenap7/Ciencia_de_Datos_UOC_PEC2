Quickly realized this was not the case because the light was visible in clear, cloudless, sky then disappeared behind faint whispy clouds. On 03/07/00 a friend and I were outside enjoying the unseasonably warm weather just after sundown around 7pm.  The visibility was great so I was looking at the stars more than usual.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw a large light in the sky approaching from the NE.  At first it reminded me of a spotlight.  I watched it briefly(3 or 4 seconds at most) before it seemed to disappear behind some very faint and thin clouds low in the southern sky, which was my first indication that it was not a light originating from the ground since it was visible in clear skies but not visible when it entered the lightly clouded area. The light was sort of a semi-circle, boomerang, like shape that kinda reminded me of a bird.  I concluded that it was not a bird, however, because birds are not luminescent and the sun was completely set.  Also the bird would have had to have been ENORMOUS to take up as much sky as it did at an altitude that was obviously higher than the thin clouds(which were very high).  The color was sort of pinkish-brown if that makes sense.  Not all that bright but clearly visible because it was first caught in my perifreals. No lights or blinkers. No sound. I'm at a loss as to what it may have been and would appreciate any educated suggestions.;38.6419;-94.3285000000001
