Cigar shape spotted in sky.;2008-07-04 20:55:00;4 minutes;Cigar shape spotted in sky. I was riding with my mom to the fireworks display in town and we both saw a cigar shaped white object to the west that seemed to be very high in the clear sky and had a glow to it like the setting sun was making it gleam.   It appeared tilted at an angle.  There was a pin of light blinking every few seconds that was at a small distance from it,  but seemed to be moving with it.   It seemed to be moving extremely slow like it was suspended in air.   We lost sight of it after about 4 minutes.   I have grown up around here watching the skies and have never seen anything like it before or anything I could not explain, but neither of us could explain this.;38.6419;-94.3285000000001
