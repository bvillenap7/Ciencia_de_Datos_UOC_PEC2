A flying ship (U.F.O) toke a cow up to its ship with a green light!!!!;2005-02-28 00:00:00;10 minutes;A flying ship (U.F.O) toke a cow up to its ship with a green light!!!! The object wasnt very clear. I could only see lights spinning around and around the outside of the U.F.O.  But there was a green light shining down from the bottom and a cow was being takin up to the ship.  It was the weirdest thing i ever seen.  After, that ship left about 2 minutes later another ship (maybe the same one) came back and it flew right above my head and it stopped right above me.  I ran for my truck and got in the truck and ran away.  The flying saucer flew away a soon as my truck to off.  This is no JOKE!!!!!

I was driving down I-49 south and I looked to my left I see a row of bright lights and look closer, I see a very faint outline of a flat disc shape, it tilts upward, I look away and look back to make sure it's still there and the lights flash on off a few times and then disappear.
