It was about the size of a bright star or planet, but was moving at a very fast speed.   Being as bright as it was, I expected to see the blinking lights as it got closer and the sound of a commercial airliner or whatever, but instead it stopped it's eastward movement and got smaller as though it went straight up.   There was no sound whatsoever.   There were no clouds to hide it, it just seemed to get smaller and disappear among the stars!;38.6419;-94.3285000000001
