Blue lights - round UFO sighted about 50 yards away from highway.;2012-08-26 12:50:00;10 minutes;blue lights - round UFO sighted about 50 yards away from highway traveling back to Iowa from the Ozarks and coming up hwy 19 before Center, MO, I seen a bright white/blue light in the distance.  It appeared above Center.  note there are also city and grain elevator lights but this was much different.   It was blue white and coming what seemed to be toward me.  By the time I woke my husband up to see this lights, it was to my left (north side of road) over a cornfield.  It was round with white and blue lights - blue round lights on bottom - was very close!  seemed to be about 50 yards away and 200 feet above the cornfield.   I was shaking!  I have never seen anything like this in my life. I continued to drive and the blue white light stayed stationary as we turned onto hwy H.   As I looked to the UFO, it seemed to be only a white light and not near as close as it had been.;39.5128;-91.5423
