I noticed the five bright lights which the street lights were unable to mask.   ((anonymous report));2016-11-06 20:12:00;2 minutes;I was taking out the trash at 8:12 pm after being told to do so by my father.  I live in town and live near a street lights that drowns out most of the stars but I tend to look up at them anyways.  While I was walking up my side walk I noticed the five bright lights which the street lights were unable to mask and I wrote them off as aircraft however there floaty movement caught my eye.  I watched them move back and forth for a few minutes in abnormal patterns not straight lines then they vanished.  The objects were flying at medium altitude  (lower than a plane) with a single solid red light on each craft.  I've never seen anything like this and felt I should share my experience.  Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.7904;-91.5324
