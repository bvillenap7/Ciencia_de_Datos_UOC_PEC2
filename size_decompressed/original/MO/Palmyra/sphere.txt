Bright green sphere with red trail;1999-02-12 04:55:00;10 seconds;Bright green sphere with red trail I drive a truck hauling US Mail.  While driving south on highway 61 about 3 miles north of Palmyra, MO, I saw a bright green colored sphere fall in an arc from the west to east and toward the ground. The object appeared very bright and as it fell it the color gradually dimmed until just before hitting the horizon it went black.  The object was followed by a bright red tail.  The object was about the size of a pea from my vantage point and the ending location was South-South-East of highway 61.  The sky was very clear.  I've seen falling stars before, and this was no falling star.;39.7904;-91.5324

I just looked out my back door and I saw a white sphereical object just moving slowly across the sky and making a rumbling noise then it just zoomed off and all the noise was gone.
