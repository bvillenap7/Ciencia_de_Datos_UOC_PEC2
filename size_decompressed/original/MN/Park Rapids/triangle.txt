((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Mars?  PD))  floating, moving  object in Park Rapids,MN.;2005-10-14 21:30:00;20+ min.;floating, moving  object in Park Rapids,MN My wife and I were taking our two dogs out to do their duty,when we had seen a strange light I mistook as a bright version of Mars.  As we kept looking at it,the color was more golden than anything else.  As we continued looking at it, it was moving in a erratic behavior, similiar to the pattern the lady you reported in Canada saw.  It had been showing itself at night every night this week.  Being a stargazer myself, I don't believe it to be a plane, a star,planet or any other mundane, ordinary object I know of.) ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Mars?  PD));46.9399;-95.0416
