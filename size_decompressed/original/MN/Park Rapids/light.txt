Blue and Red ball of light, that just floated in the sky , TELEPATHY THEORY MY OWN ENCOUNTER;2003-09-25 03:00:00;4 hours;Blue and Red ball of light, that just floated in the sky , TELEPATHY THEORY MY OWN ENCOUNTER I saw two lights. Off to the right was a red round shape light, off to the left was a blue round shaped light about 1/2 apart. They both were about as high in the sky as your usuall water towers. The amazing event that occurd was that I wanted to see them in this area because it was a UFO hot-spot about 25-30 years ago. In that time frame, my mom and other relatives saw craft and lights on differnt ocasions. Also there is a cattle farm right next to where I saw the crafts. The most idea I want to explain is that I mostly looked at the blue one, because It moved/floated to which ever direction I mentally told it to. It was actually kinda of friendly. They stayed there untill I left the area. My family knows I am not making this ((deleted)) up, because they all saw unexplained events at differnt times in the same area years ago.;46.9399;-95.0416
