Solid black orb steadily floating along the horizon during sunset.;2014-07-05 21:00:00;2 minutes;Solid black orb steadily floating along the horizon during sunset My sister and I had seen a suspicious orange pulsating light over the horizon of our lake home the night preceding this report as well.   It was directly above the tree tops at about 10 pm on July 4.  I am certain that this was not any type of firework, as I've never seen a firework behave in that manner.  The nearest firework display had been cancelled because of flooding to confirm that it was not a remnant of a firework show.  It flew horizontally across the sky, at a steady, but fast pace. It was too fast to be a plane, and did not dissipate like a firework would.  The next day, July 5, my family and I went out on a sunset boat cruise around the lake.  The sunset was spectacular, reflecting against the clouds and as anyone would, we were in awe at the sight.  I was first to notice a strange, almost black sphere floating between some clouds. I pointed it out to my family, and they began to stare with confusion too.  It behaved in the exact same manner as the object the night before, but did not appear to have any visible lights against the intense sunset.   Again, this object was far too fast to be a plane, didn't fade or create smoke like a firework, and was far too close to be a satellite.   The object flew out of sight, and seemingly into the setting sun and surrounding clouds.;47.2856;-93.3702
