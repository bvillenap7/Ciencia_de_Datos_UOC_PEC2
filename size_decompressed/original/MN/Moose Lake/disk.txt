Floating down the light beam;1976-09-02 03:00:00;5 minutes?;Floating down the light beam I woke up hearing the phone ringing & saw that I was floating down from the ceiling in a beam of light, then I was in the bed & sat up to answer the phone, which was continuing to ring. I saw that the light beam was still streaming through the ceiling and looked up to see my friend floating down. She landed on the bed and sat straight up and gaped back at me. We just looked at each other, flabergasted, and then both looked up just as the light blinked out. I immediately got up & went into the other room to answer the phone which was placed next to the picture window in the living room. As I picked up the reciever I was that there was a disc shaped craft hovering about 50 feet over the house. At first I could see the edge of a dark circular shape with an extremely bright circle of light coming out of the middle of the bottom. As I said 'Hello it was slowly traveling northeast away from the house and when it got about 500 yards away the light blinked off and the disc zoomed away into the horizon. I have no other memories of the event.;46.4502;-92.7505
