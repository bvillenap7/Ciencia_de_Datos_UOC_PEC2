9 amber spheres in northern sky;2014-07-01 19:30:00;5 minutes;9 amber spheres in northern sky Was traveling home from a prison Bible study on a clear night.  I saw 9 amber spheres in the northern sky that were in formation of 3 across and three above them and three more above those ones.  One on the right side was pulsing.    My vision of them became obscured by some trees so I thought I would catch them on the other side of a stand of trees.   When I reached the other side the spheres were nowhere to be seen.
