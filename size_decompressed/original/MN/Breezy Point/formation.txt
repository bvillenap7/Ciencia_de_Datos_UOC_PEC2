We were driving east on County Road 11 from Pequot Lakes to Breezy Point when I noticed 9-10 bright orange lights in the sky flying in three almost perfect perpendicular columns off in the distance maybe 1-2 miles out.   I slowed down the car to take in the scene and my other two passengers in the car witnessed them too.  They appeared to be hovering over Pelican Lake.   We watched them for about 4-5 minutes before they slowly faded away individually, one light at a time.;46.6279;-94.2725
