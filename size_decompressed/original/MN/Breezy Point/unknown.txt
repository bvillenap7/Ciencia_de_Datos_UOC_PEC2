I was laying down on the dock at 11:00pm cooling in the winds and watching the stars when a very bright object appeared as if it was entering the atmosphere.  The bright light gained in intesity for a period of maybe two seconds.  It appeared to be mostly white.  It was almost like having a heavenly flashlight shined in your face it was so bright.  And then the light dimmed until I saw only a small point of light like a satellite.  The pinpoint of light then traveled southeast at about satellite speed, but then seemed to raise in elevation until it disappeared.  About 15 minutes later a similar object appeared.;46.6279;-94.2725
