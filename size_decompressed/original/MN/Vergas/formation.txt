After seeing what we thought where satellites and watching them along with planes pass by I noticed a light coming over the trees from the south.  The light was white and moving fast and what appeared to be very high, as high as the satallites.  The light would get bright and dim very slowley and seem to disappear but only got dim.  You could still see it through the binoculars while it was dim.   Then as it got overhead we were both surprised to notice at the same time there where more than one and all going in formation and all getting bright and dim at different times.  No noise, no trails and thay kept going north until thay disappeared in the sky.   At that point we saw two aircraft lights coming from the west (Fargo) and head north as if looking for something.   We agreed there must have been 8 object but, they where difficult to count because of the dimming and brightening.
