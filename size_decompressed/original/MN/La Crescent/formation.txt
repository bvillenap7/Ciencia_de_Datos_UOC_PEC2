six strange lights in the sky over La Crescent MN;2008-10-10 20:00:00;10 seconds;six strange lights in the sky over La Crescent MN There were six lights that appeared to be at a distance, set in a formation of four lights in the front and two in the back making a forward slash type line, if you were to connect them.  I saw it while I was laying in the front yard stargazing, I was hoping to see a shooting star so I had my eyes open for any movement in the sky, I saw a few airplanes, and then the UFO. I  KNOW it wasn’t an airplane because I had already seen those. It stayed in the sky moving north for about six to eight seconds before disappearing near the constellation Cassiopeia. I then saw my shooting star, but it lasted much longer than any normal shooting star. Then about ten seconds after the object disappeared, there was a strange noise that I couldn’t explain. Unfortunately no one else saw it, and it was flying fairly far away.;43.8323;-91.3281000000001
