Noiseless flying Triangular craft over town.;2010-04-10 22:10:00;5 SECONDS;Noiseless flying Triangular craft over town. At approximately 10:10pm I stepped outdoors because I heard several Dogs that had been barking for at least 20 minutes. I looked up into the night sky because it was a clear star filled night. I then witnessed a Triangular craft that had 3 very dim lights in each corner, or maybe it reflected the City lights from below. The other thing that stood out in my mind is that it was dark, as if flying covertly. The object was traveling fast and only about 600 to 900' altitude. It was difficult for me to gage the size of it. The object made no noise at all that I could hear.;45.1551;-94.6834
