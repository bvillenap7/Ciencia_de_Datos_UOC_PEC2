Two red pulsating spheres traveling in offset formation.;2013-12-31 20:30:00;3 minutes;two red pulsating spheres traveling in offset formation Seen 2 objects traveling north to South.  In almost an offset formation one leading the other.  Objects were spheres of light pulsating red to a dim orange in color.  Not blinking like an aircraft but a slow change between colors.  Seen them out window and went to look at them on deck.  At the time they were approx 10 degrees off horizon.  Called wife to see them.  Observed them move right to left in southern direction.  When they reached a point perpendicular to us they were at a 45 degree elevation and both objects slowly dimmed to nothing simultaneously;45.3134;-93.5809000000004
