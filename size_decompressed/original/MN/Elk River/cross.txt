Was outside doing yard work and looked up to see a white jet flying south over the house, leaving a white trail behind.  Followed the trail and saw a large black object which at first I thought was a large hawk or crow as we leave in the country.  Noticed is was hovering, not actually traveling.  I then noticed their was no movement of the wings.  I called my 13 yr old daughter over to see and we watched this shape hover and slightly change direction for a few minutes.  It wasn't a plane as it had no noise, no trail and hovered.  Wasn't a bird as the wings never moved and it hovered way too long to be a bird.  Was not a helicopter.  My last thought was maybe a RC plane, but again no noise and stayed too still too long.  At once it made a turn toward the sun where we saw light reflect off it and then it made a 45 degree turn north and shot over the house in seconds it was out of sight.  We still talk about it o this day.  A! ny thoughts or ideas would be great!;45.3134;-93.5809000000004
