On my daily commute to work I, I generally see a scheduled flight coming in to the Range Regional Airport.  On this particular morning, I noticed the inbound when they turned on the landing lights in preparation for landing.  Navigation lights were also visible. Then I noticed a second inbound.  About 4-5 miles behind the first and appeared to be on the same glide slope. The second inbound was surprising to me because it’s a small regional airport.  Then I noticed the second inbound looked a bit “off”.  The landing lights were much brighter than normal and were vertically oriented rather than horizontal.  I momentarily took my eyes off the second to watch the road and follow the first aircraft disappear below the horizon as they were on short final for the airport.  I concentrated on the second inbound to try and determine what it was.  After a few seconds of watching it still following along the approach lane for the airport, it was about 5 miles out in front of me when the lights dimmed a bit.  That’s when i noticed it appeared to be a cylinder or a rectangular shape with lights on the top and bottom.  The lights came back up and it translated straight up.  It went to 30,000 + feet in a second or two then bolted off due west and was out of sight in less than 3 seconds.  Well beyond the capabilities of known aircraft.  Total time I watched this was about 3 minutes.  Please note, I work part time for MNDNR forestry as an aerial observer spotting wild land fires over this area.;47.5022;-92.8565
