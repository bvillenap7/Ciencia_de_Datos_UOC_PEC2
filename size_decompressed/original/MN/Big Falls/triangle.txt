I looked up to watch it, and saw that it wasn't a shooting star, it was 3 individual lights in a triangular formation, moving in sync.  The lights continued in a straight line for a few seconds, paused momentarily, the shot upwards and disappeared.  I couldn't see much detail of the craft itself, but it looked metallic, as there were areas near the lights where it was illuminated enough to see a little bit of the curves of the craft.  I live in the country, so no light pollution, no airplanes (this obviously wasn't an airplane anyway), it is a relatively clear night, and it was well above the tree line, so I had a very clear view.;48.2463;-93.7842
