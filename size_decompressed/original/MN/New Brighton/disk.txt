A close encounter with some backup.;1979-09-29 10:00:00;10 Minutes;A close encounter with some backup. In the fall of 1979, my friend and I were playing with a ball outside of our apartment building.  A spere shaped Spacecraft with dome on top appeared about 100 feet in the air.  It was about the diameter of a DC-10.  Golden in color.  There were bright lights that rotated around it.  There were black windows that appeared to be absent of light. The ship made a soft hum, almost silent, and could move in any direction.  It slowly moved over us for 5-7 Minutes then shot of into the horizon.  We showed it to my friends Mom but she wasn't sure what she saw it was now so far away.  My parents wouldn't believe me until the next days news reported a sherif attacked the same night.  There is unaccounted for time in the middle of my encounter. I saw my friend in 1991.  It was the first thing we discussed.  It felt good to have him verify.

Flying Saucers Over Lake in St. Paul!;2000-10-04 22:45:00;0.1;Flying Saucers Over Lake in St. Paul! I was looking up to observe the full moon that was coming over the horizon, and there they were, right over the lake.  5 flying saucers hovering over Long Lake.  They made white streaks in in the atmoshpere as they slowly moved twords me.  Then all of the sudden, a very large flash occured, and they rocketed straight twords the heavans.  Each spacecraft was around 10 feet in diameter.  They hoverd out on the lake for almost ten minuets before leaving.  My parents and friends did not belive me when I told them.  They craft were mysteriously silent.;45.0689;-93.1991
