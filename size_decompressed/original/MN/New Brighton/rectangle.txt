The Square looked something like being in the dark and looking at an unlit house, suddenly the door opens and there is a bright rectangle, 4 seconds later the door closes and...nothing..this is what it looked like, except the rectangle changed it apparent angle, as if reflecting sunlight. The sight then looked like a luminous square with a dark square within it. WHAT MAKE THIS SO STRANGE IS THAT IT JUST DISSAPEARED... NO TRACE..NO VAPOR TRAIL..JUST EMPTY BACKROUND SPACE. Being a star gaiser my whole life , taking astronomy class, buying telescopes and reading space related advances..this was like nothing I have ever witnessed. No, this was not a meteor, balloon, or sattelite changing the angle and reflecting sunlite. The apparent diameter was almost a quarter the size of a full moon. The question is HOW CAN AN OBJECT APPEAR, CHANGE ANGLE AND DISSAPEAR..ALMOST AS IF IT WAS IN BETWEEN SOME SORT OF SHIELD...UNFORTUNATELY , THIS SEEMS IT WAS FOR MY EYES ONLY...VERY PECULIAR..;45.0689;-93.1991
