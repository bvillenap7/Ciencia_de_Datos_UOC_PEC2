Black ball UFO about 75 feet across on a sunny partly cloudy day;2004-07-15 13:00:00;5 minutes;Black ball UFO about 75 feet across on a sunny partly cloudy day I was laying at Silver Lake Beach in New Brighton and I happened to look up in the clouds on a partly clouded day and noticed what I first thought was a ballon.  I took a closer looks and it looked like a black object and judging by the distance had to be about at least 75 feet across.  I layed at the beach also saw it and so did someone else out on the lake who noticed us both looking up in the sky and also looked at it.  A commercial jet also went by at a lower altitude, although it did not take evasive action.  After about five minutes it quickly went behind a cloud at a rate faster than any commercial jet move...think of a computer mouse moving across a computer screen with a partly cloudly sky background and you get the idea.  Definately a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));45.0689;-93.1991
