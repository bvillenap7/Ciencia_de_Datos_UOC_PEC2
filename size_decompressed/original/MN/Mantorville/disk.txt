I've been sitting here watching this light out our living room window to the west.  Didn't think anything of it until it didn't move. Just sat still.  Been watching it now for the last 20 minutes and it's still there.  At a closer look it has red and green flashing lights that seem to go around in a circle.  It's not moving closer nor further away.  After about 25 minutes it moved straight up but same distance away.  After another 5 it just disappeared.;44.0636;-92.7555
