Large bright light moving slow in straight line, no sound, 5,000 to 10,000 ft high then disappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.  PD));2015-06-14 22:30:00;2 minutes;Large bright light moving slow in straight line, no sound, 5,000 to 10,000 ft high then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects report on August 13, stating that he believes that the object was the International Space Station.  PD)) At approximately 10:30 pm last Sunday night, my wife and I were on our patio.  I looked directly above my head and saw a brilliant white light traveling east.  The object was traveling slow, in a straight line and did not deviate its course.  We couldn't see the shape of the object because the light was so bright.  It was about 4 times as large as the planet Jupiter that night, which was very bright and clear.   There was no sound and the weather was perfect, no wind.  I saw a commercial jet above the object which travel at approximately 30,000 feet, so my best guess at the height of this object was 5,000 to 10,000 feet high (really difficult to determine). I did check the internet and the space station was near Venezuela at the time.   As it was traveling away, it suddenly disappeared or the light was shut off.   I don't believe it was a satellite because it was just too low.   Again, large bright white light (4 times size of Jupiter), traveling slow across sky, no sound, 5,000 to 10,000 ft high, immediately disappeared after 2 minutes.;45.8826999999998;-95.3782999999995
Blinking satellite type objects.;2016-08-13 05:15:00;5 minutes;blinking satellite type objects I always look at the sky.  In the last week, I have observed this twice (all info same for both).  Objects which appeared to be satellites but moving slower, appeared to be approximately same altitude as a satellite.   The strange observation is both moving slower than a typical satellite, from west to east.  These things would light up (not sure if reflection or their own light) every 5 to 14 seconds, no specific sequence.  They both would dim to the point where you couldn't see them and then they would light up for a second or two (not flash).  The amount of light would be different each time from rather dim to very brilliant and they didn't appear to be beacons on and aircraft.   No clouds in the sky and was still pretty dark.  I'm not saying these are UFOs but it would be nice to get some feed back.  No sound from either.  Main question is, what would cause a satellite to be very dim and then become so brilliant all the way across the sky, in intervals anywhere from 5 to 14 seconds?;45.8826999999998;-95.3782999999995
Multiple lights seen moving together in a line west to east.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-20 20:20:00;30 minutes;Multiple lights seen moving together in a line west to east. I have observed this event 3 separate times in one month. There is always a straight line of them moving across the sky. West to east. The first two times i saw them they were very organized and in one colum. This time there was two lines following 2 different trajectories. They don't seem hard to spot just go outside and look up. They remind me of what the International space station.looks like both in size and speed of travel.;45.8826999999998;-95.3782999999995
