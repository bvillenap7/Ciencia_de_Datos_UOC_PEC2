Blocked Memory;1985-08-01 13:00:00;Unknown;Blocked Memory  500 Lights On Object0: Yes Around 1985, I was a freshman in high school.  About a week before my incident, a neighborhood friend was claiming on the school bus that he saw a UFO and was carrying his camera and was saying that he was going to photograph it.  I obviously disregarded his story. About a week later, a friend and I were staying at my home in Alexandria, MN (chain of lakes area) and we decided to sneak out for some adventure.  We were walking up a very steep road which used to be a winter sled hill.  The road runs approximately east to west from the lake on the east.  We were about halfway up the road/hill, fields and trees to the north, neighborhood to the south, when suddenly a triangular object with a light on each point appeared about tree top level.  I only had about enough time to say &quotwow&quot.  All I remember after that was looking at my friend to say, &quotthat was strange&quot and we walked home and went to bed, not saying another word.  We never talked abo! ut it except when I started having memory flashbacks.  My friend denies seeing a UFO and says it was a &quotstealth fighter&quot.  My friend on the school bus, whom I talked to many years later, says that there are &quotmany of us out there&quot.  Whatever it was has the ability to block and influence memory.  It/they are unimaginably superior to us.  I debate with myself if it is a spiritual force rather than an actual &quotliving&quot force.  This could be similar to shape shifting events of other types of sightings  we see things that are real, yet never can obtain physical evidence.  I tend to believe that we are seeing is likely at a spiritual level or from a dimension parallel to ours but having the ability to influence.  We have not developed the ability to cross over to these dimensions however, they are real, yet not something we can get our hands on.

6 red non blinking  triangle shape lights;2012-06-29 02:15:00;30 seconds;6 red non blinking  triangle shape lights Just got back to my sons apartment after a movie.  I was looking up in the sky to see the star and any satellites going over.  I looked over to the left where I was standing and saw a triangle shaped 6 dim non blinking red lights in the northeast sky.  One in front 2 on each sides and 3 in the back.  It was moving very quickly and silently to the east word pattern.  I looked over to my daughter to see if she saw it also.  She did but my son didn't.;45.8826999999998;-95.3782999999995
