I saw an alien;2002-06-25 03:00:00;30 sec;I saw an alien I was sleeping out in the backyard with my sister when I woke up.  I did not know what woke me up so I looked at my watch.  It said 3:00 exactly.  I then noticed that the side of the tent that faced the wetlands and lake was lit up.  I would like to tell everyone that it was no a light from a boat.  The wetlands is inbetween my house and lake and it is about 150 yards wide and there is no way a light could have been that bright off a boat.  I then saw what I truly believe to be a shadow of a torso and arm of an alien.  I watched it for about thirty seconds and saw the fingers move in a manner that assured me that it was not a inatamate object being blown by the wind.  I became frightened and hid in my sleeping bag.  I do not know how long they were there but when I came out of my sleeping bag about an hour later the light was gone and so was the Alien.
