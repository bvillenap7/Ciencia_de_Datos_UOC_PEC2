My friend and I were planning on sleeping outside around his campfire one night. So we went outside and set up camp. Then at around 11:37pm, we were listening to Led Zepplin. As we woke up and looked up we noticed some strange lights in the air. We yelled for my friends parents. His parent came out and we just stood and watched these strange lights in the air. They were sort of a greenish tinted light. The 12 lights were an oval shapped and did not look real big. From our view they looked about 1 centimeter. So if they were up close i would have to guess they were all about the size of a small jet. This unidentified object sat still for approximitly 2 minutes. Then in an instant, they just vanished.;44.8293508474576;-93.0672203389831
