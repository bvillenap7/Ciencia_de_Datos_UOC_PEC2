This object didn't move, I watched it for several minutes and noticed it didn't move at all. I went and got my camcorder and put the rest of this sighting on DVD, I zoomed in on it and saw what was circular and red color flashing somewhat near its center. I have about one minute of this. I have it in slow motion to better the look on it.;44.8293508474576;-93.0672203389831
