Fast Moving Burning Sphere which Disappeared;2014-05-17 12:15:00;20-30 seconds;Fast Moving Burning Sphere which Disappeared I looked out my kitchen Window and saw a round 40 to 60' sphere.  It was flashing bright red, then light red with a yellow fire surrounding 1/3 of it.  I then went outside on my deck and watched it flash more brightly, then it sped up and disappeared while traveling N to NE at a high speed.  It started at about 20 degrees over St. Paul and disappeared over St. Paul Park at about 35 degrees.  Total time watching 20-30 seconds.  No wind, clear sky, no noise or jets seen in the area. Temp 42.  Full Moon to the South.   I have been watching airplanes and the space station for years.  I have seen a MD-80 Engine snuff out during daylight and the plane had to turn around and for a landing at MSP.  I thought maybe a airplane had engine problems so I went out on my on the deck, to maybe call 911.   This object made no noise and was very quick in the upward movement it made.  Very strange color changes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));44.8293508474576;-93.0672203389831
