We were walking back and noticed three orange fireballs no more than a hundred feet from the ground. they made a triangle shape with one way in front and two next to each other in the back. the first one slowly disapeared and than the next two did the same seconds later . we than looked where they had come from and saw three more doing the exact same thing, one of the last ones seemed to be lower than any of them but we still could not get a good description. We finished our walk home and found articles a lot like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.8293508474576;-93.0672203389831
Looked like something about to crash.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  Other reports from MN for same date.  PD));2009-12-11 01:15:00;< 5 seconds;Looked like something about to crash At or about 1:15 A.M. on Friday, December 11, I saw a bright streaking light that I have never seen before.  It looked like something that was going to crash into the earth in the northern sky.  It was bigger than any shooting star or meteor shower I have seen in my lifetime and was moving much quicker.  It was also brighter and a different color (green tint). ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  Other reports from MN for same date.  PD));44.8293508474576;-93.0672203389831
