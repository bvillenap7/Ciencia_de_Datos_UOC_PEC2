While attending the Sonshine festival Willmar Minnesota as sundown was approaching my teenaged daughter noticed a black object flyinging in a stationary (hovering) position directly over the concert.  I noticed it too and since we were at a concert I had a monocular.  I used it to look closer and saw a totally black triangular object that appeared to be at least a thousand feet or more above ground.  My daughter, her sister and my wife each eventually looked at the object through the monocular.  My wife who is a pilot insists that it was not like any flying object she has ever seen. Each of us took turns the next day drawing a picture of what we saw. Without any help from each other we all drew the same item. There were no lights (on the object) and no reflection from the sun.  The object eventually became impossible to see as the sun went down. It made no noise.;45.1385999999993;-95.0524999999997
