FORMATION OF DISKS SHOOT ACROSS THE SKY .;2001-09-21 08:40:00;12-15 seconds;FORMATION OF DISKS SHOOT ACROSS THE SKY . I had just pulled into my driveway. And as I got off my van, I happened to glance up at the sky, right over my neighbors house. At that moment I saw about seven to nine lights shoot across the sky. The lights were amber in color and they weren't blinking, the lights were steady. They looked a little bigger than the brightest star. They seemed disk shaped. They were in a formation, two lines parallel to each other, but one line was one disk ahead of the other. About four or five seconds into the sighting, the last disk maneuvered its way to the front in what seemed a split second. I ran to the left side of my house as they dissapeared over my house. I caught sight of them again on the other side of my house, but only for a couple of seconds, then they disapeared behind some trees.;45.1385999999993;-95.0524999999997
