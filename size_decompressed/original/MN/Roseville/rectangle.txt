Saw something extraordinary;1976-07-20 05:30:00;15 seconds;Saw something extraordinary I was walking to work, took a shortcut through a wooded area adjacent to a cemetary. I walked down a dirt track towards the cemetary, there was a large alfalfa field to my left forming a gradual downward slope. It was still dark, just a hint of light on the horizon. I sensed, or heard something, like a strong breeze moving the trees in the woodline to my left, as I turned to the left, looking downhill, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Feeling spooked, I turned to keep walking. A dark moving shape came from my left side, rising quickly, traveling to the right. I saw it best when it was about at my ten o'clock high position. It looked like a Huey helicopter, with a similar style windscreen, towards the front, the rest of the craft reminded me most of a Star Trek shuttle craft, but it was very dark in color, and I only caught a glimpse. It hung in the air with a nose down attitude, like a helicopter taking off, then, was gone. I saw it only for in instant, it made absolutely no sound. I didn't really see it fly in any direction. It was just there for an instant, then gone.It just seemed to flash away, although it emitted no light. My heart was racing, though I did not feel afraid, just excited. After I walked the 2 miles to work, where at the time I was a clean up boy at a bakery, I remember telling a co-worker, I saw something really strange this morning...
