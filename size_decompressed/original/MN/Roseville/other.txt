L-shaped object with bright lights and was dead silent.  ((anonymous report));2017-04-24 20:45:00;15 seconds;L shaped object with bright lights and was dead silent. I was outside, when all of a sudden, I looked up and saw this L-shaped object with very bright lights,  if it was a plane, I would've heard the engine, and it wasn't flying in a typical flight pattern.   By the time I grabbed binoculars and my phone, it was out of my line of sight.   After the object was gone the power lines gave off a very loud hum.
