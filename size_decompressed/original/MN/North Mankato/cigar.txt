Small white cigar shaped object, low in sky, hovered for 2 minutes, then disappeared, no trail.;2008-05-25 19:45:00;2 minutes;Small white cigar shaped object, low in sky, hovered for 2 minutes, then disappeared, no trail. Two friends and I were golfing on the 10th hole at North Links golf course, and there was clear blue sky.  As we looked forward into the sky, one of us noticed a white, cigar or tampon shaped object sitting in the sky, no wings, obviously not a plane or helicopter, and there was no smoke or jetstream coming from the object.  It was probably about 500 yards or so away in the sky.  We sat stunned, asking each other,  what could that possibly be, besides a UFO. No one wanted to tee off, because we wanted to wait to see what happened with the foreign craft.  After about 2 minutes, the craft gradually got smaller for about 10 seconds, and then completely disapppeared like it went into stealth mode, again, no smoke or anything, it just vanished. Within minutes of seeing the craft, a small army type plane was flying in the same general area where we had seen the craft.  We kept looking for the next two hours of golf, but no reappearance occurred. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));44.2192;-94.095
