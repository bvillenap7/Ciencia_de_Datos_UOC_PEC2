Obj;2010-05-28 00:16:00;:17;Object flew from the southeast gaining slight altitude as it floated across the sky just under cloud level at a high rate of speed.  Object appeared solid round, and was a fire ball like orange color. Completed full length of the visible sky in about 20 seconds or less.  Didn't have the look of mechanical flight. Just floated across the sky effortlessly.  Disappeared in the slight cloudiness northeast.  No sound. No trail.  We took a quick picture with a cell phone, which shows a small yellowish or orange dot in the blackness.;44.2192;-94.095
