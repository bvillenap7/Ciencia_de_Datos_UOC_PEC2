Glowing red orb seen for 15 seconds.;2014-06-17 23:00:00;15 seconds;Glowing red orb seen for 15 seconds. On June 17 at about 11:00 or 12:00 in North Mankato, Minnesota, I witnessed a red glowing orb hovering in a tree about 100 or 150 feet from my house.   I was looking eastward and it was on the west side of the tree.  I witnessed it for about 15 seconds, it was standing still and pulsed brighter two times, then it quickly flew from the tree southward leaving a red trail of light about 10 or 20 feet long and disappeared all together.   It was hard to tell the size of the object as it was illuminated, but i would guess it could have been the size of a golf ball at the smallest and no larger than a basketball.   These are the google maps coordinates exactly where it was 44.17xxxx, -94.03xxxx ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the source of the report, and he sounded eloquent and sober-minded, in our opinion.
