Although I was not able to see the craft up close, the person who contacted me had a pair of binoculars, and stated that the craft was triangular in shape and rotating slightly.  I oberseved that the craft moved in mutliple directions, but only for a short periods of time before it came back to center.  It moved up, down, left, and right.  I saw this after he had called and told me to look tward Hutchinson, which is about 20 miles north-west of my home.  It was about 35-45 degrees up when I saw it, and was, well, two stars down from the edge of the big dipper.  I called another friend of mine, just to make sure I wasn't seeing things, she oberved the same shape as well.  I tried looking at it later, but was unable becuase the stars had moved and I could not refrence it to any stationary body.  Thanks for your time.;44.5468;-94.1925
