One satellite chasing another;2011-10-02 21:00:00;1 minute;One satellite chasing another Was probably just two satellites that happened to be orbiting in such a way as to create this illusion, but it appeared that one satellite was closely following another as if chasing it, their paths seemed to converge and then both disappeared.  The sky is very clear here and I see satellites all the time....they basically look like moving stars as opposed to airplanes which have flashing lights, etc.  I was looking toward the northeast somewhat and fairly high up in the sky.  Am simply reporting it in case you happen to get many other reports around the same time, so that it could help to corroborate them.
