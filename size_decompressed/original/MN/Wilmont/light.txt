It was bright white with red flashes, moving slowly upward... When I got home I pointed out the object to my mother, father and one sister.  (a farm family, 5 miles away from the nearest town)  We watched the object continue slowly upward out the north window of our house.  It then speed up and to the right before stopping.  After sitting still for a minute or so, the main object got lighter as a small red object seperated and slowly moved to the east of the main object. Shortly after, another small red object moved off to the west, again making the main object lighter.  The remaining part of the main object then moved off to the west.  The final three objects looked the same, each having 2 points of red light.  They moved slowly out of site.  The events took 5 to 7 minutes to transpire.;43.7685;-95.8378
