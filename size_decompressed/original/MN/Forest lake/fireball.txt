I had a very good view of the south sky as well as west and east other than some trees on the west side of my view.  I was sitting in my truck on the phone facing south.  Sunny afternoon. I noticed what looked like a meteor very white like a cloud, shaped like a falling sphere of white gas.  Very white, and looked more like a cloud than anything else, but it was traveling west to east at a 45 degree angle coming down towards the earth. It had a tail that would shrink and than get longer every few seconds. suddenly it faced straight downward like it was falling from the sky. I video taped the entire event, but my phone camera did not seem to pick up the image. I looked out beyond my camera as it was recording and I could see it perfectly, and when I returned my vision to the camera it wasn't in the viewing area recording.  It went west to east.  a je! t plane like a 747 through right through my line of sight of the object.  The 747 looked 1/10th the size.  I am sure the pilot(s) on that jet saw the object.  The object also had very small white popping lights like a sizzler but far less lights popping. I lost sight as it went down beyond my line of vision of the trees but looked like it was going to land somewhere.  Hope someone else had seen this and reports it as I have.;45.268;-92.9743
