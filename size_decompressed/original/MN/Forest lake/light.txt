I was laying in bead at 11:10 and noticed bright lights flashing. a tree obstructed my view, but i was able to see light moving from the sky down to tree and house level and back up again. I could not identify a shape because the light was bright in an asymetrical form. Im going to say it landed because it hovered in a way for a long time at house level. I could not get a clear shot because i did not have a camera at hand and my camera phone had too much glare from the window.;45.268;-92.9743
