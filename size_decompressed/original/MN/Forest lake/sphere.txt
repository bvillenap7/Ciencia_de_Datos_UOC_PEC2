Large rectangular object with a white light at each end disrupting the atmosphere around it.;2014-10-19 23:00:00;5-10 seconds;Large rectangular object with a white light at each end disrupting the atmosphere around it. Star gazing, about 25 minutes into it we see a HUGE rectangular craft with a white light at each end.  We could see right through the object..  As it traveled in a west to east direction it made no sound, and it moved at an angle.  While noticing a light at each end, the strangest thing was we could see the stars behind it as it passed through the sky making it pretty much invisible.  (minus the two white lights)  There did seem to be some disruption in the atmosphere right around the object as it went from west to east.  CREEPY!
