It appeared out of thin air just like a clingon ship on Star Trek.  It was cloked invisible.  It didn't move, just hovered at a 40Â° angle.  Was extremely high up.  Like a jet but very large.  I was traveling south on Hwy 35.  Then it vanished. I pointed to the sky to my driver who looked also.  Than it reappeared again for another 20+seconds and again vanished.  It was chrome with sun reflecting off it and a black tinted window facing earth almost half the size of the craft.  It was Thanksgiving day.  My driver a female said she didn't ever wanna talk about it again and was shaken up.  It's the only one ive ever witnessed.  It didn't have wings or nothing just a perfect egg shape.  It was able to be invisible that I have no doubt.;45.268;-92.9743
