White/Blue Unknown Craft in Forest Lake, MN;2012-06-06 00:30:00;2 seconds;White/Blue Unknown Craft in Forest Lake, MN At approx 00:30 on above date, while driving southbound on I35 towards the St.Paul/Mpls area, I saw what appeared it be a elongated, illuminated craft hover in the air.  It had a bright, neon blue circle on the rear with a bright white light in the middle.  Along the side of the craft, it was glowing white.  The craft appeared oval to me but I saw it only for two seconds as it hovered, turned, then took off at a speed in which I cannot describe.  It was there, then a bright streak, and it was gone.  I am reporting this just 20 mins from the time it happened.  I actually called Channel 5 Eyewitness News in the Twin Cities area to see if anyone had seen what I did, but they had not.  I know aircraft and I understand propulsion, this was nothing that human beings are capable of doing, not hovering and taking off at this speed.  What I just saw was a UFO and Nobody, Nobody will convince me otherwise.;45.268;-92.9743
4th of July 2014 - Lighted spherical object in the sky over Forest Lake, Minnesota.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;5-8 minutes;4th of July 2014 - Lighted spherical object in the sky over Forest Lake, Minnesota Saw object high in the sky moving slowly, sometimes nearly stationary and then in multiple non linear directions returning closely to its original position.   It was very clear in the sky and we could see color light (blue and red) moving continuously around the edge.  It was to the south of the Lake.   After approximately 5 minutes it turned to the NE, climbed higher into the sky and moved fairly quick to the North towards Duluth.   It disappeared completely within minutes.   It was an incredible experience.;45.268;-92.9743
