I saw one dot of light moving quite fast in a south-south west direction, and about a half-hour later another object or the same object flew along the same flight path in the oppisite direction. I would like to know if there are any satelites with that flight path. Oh, it took them about 7-10 seconds to fly horizion to horizion.;44.4969;-92.8634

After 4 hours of it hovering in the same spot a second object identical to the first one appears, they both disappear without a trace around the 6 hour mark, most bazaar thing I've ever seen in my life.
