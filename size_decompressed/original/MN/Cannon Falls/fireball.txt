Bright orange light glided across the sky from East to West that appeared almost like a plane on fire, but was an orb shape.  As it neared I could see a pale blue color at its center, and it looked like flames.  It had what appeared to be a halo off to the South. I saw it from a window and walked outside for a better look and heard here was no sound.  I first appeared to me through the window as it came over the horizon of rooftops and then disappeared after it reached the tree tops of the nearby woods, so it seemed to be flying low.;44.4969;-92.8634
