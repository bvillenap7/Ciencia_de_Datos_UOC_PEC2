It appeared white but turned bright silver when reflecting the sun.  I sped up to get closer.  I thought it was a helicopter at first but it had no propellers on top.   It sped further ahead of me at least a half mile in just a second.  It hovered for a few more seconds and disappeared.  Two commercial airliners were higher in the sky to the right and coming in for landing at MSP airport.  I looked all over the sky and saw it again higher up and to the right about 5 miles away.  It travelled forward for a brief time in a straight flying pattern and then disappeared.  It was white except for when the setting sun shone directly on it where it turned shiny silver.;44.4969;-92.8634
