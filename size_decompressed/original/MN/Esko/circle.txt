At first I thought it was an airplane, but clearly wasn't.  It was moving and suddenly stopped and just sat in the sky for about 20 minutes.  It was bright and had blinking lights of color? Like some red, blue, and green.  Then would kinda move slowly back and fourth and in different directions.   Me and my dad were watching it with a telescope as well.  Eventually after about 20/25 minutes, it's suddenly just left and quickly disappeared.;46.7156;-92.3609
