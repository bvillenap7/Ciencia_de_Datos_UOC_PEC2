Anomolus satelite moving EAST TO WEST????;2014-08-27 22:45:00;1-2 minutes;Anomolus Satelite moving EAST TO WEST???? About 22:30 I sat down in a plastic chair facing east to watch a patch of sky for north-south satelites.  The patch I watch is bordered by leafy tree branches. At about 22:45 I saw a pinpoint of light moving FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST across the sky patch at the normal rate of speed for a satelite in low earth orbit.  I lost sight of it as it passed overhead and I failed to move from my chair.  Total time in view was 1-2 minutes. This struck me as remarkable because I know that most satelites are launched with an EASTWARD component to gain a launch speed asist of up to 1000 MPH from the earth's rotation. Have you had any similar reports?  Can NORAD shead any light on this object? ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the source of the reportâ€¦visible satellites do not have a westerly component to ther groundtrack, as they orbit Earth.  We suspect that the witness is a skilled sky watcher.  PD));45.6360000000002;-94.2170000000002
