My wife woke me up about a three months ago about 5.30 in the morning she asked me to look out the window at this star that she's never noticed.  So a couple minutes later I get up and looking at this star for about 2-3 minutes and kind of wondering what the hell, Cause I've never noticed this star either. It takes off...it dips down and goes to the north very fast I'm still puzzled today!!! Watch the skies!!!I tell my friends about it and they look at me like I'm crazy or something.  It was about a week earlier my parents called and told me about this, they were in bed about 11 pm watching tv the lake had just frozen over and they don't have neighbors' around, but this big yellowish color light was shining up from the lake they watched it out the window for about 20 minutes then it just like shut off and was gone...  I don't know what is going on but something is.... ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));45.6360000000002;-94.2170000000002
