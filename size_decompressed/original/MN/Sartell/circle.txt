Circular Light pulsing in northern part of sky with duration of approx 13 seconds.;2020-11-25 23:24:00;13 seconds;Circular Light pulsing in northern part of sky with duration of approx 13 seconds. I walked outside to let my dogs out and as I opened the door and stood out there for a while...I suddenly noticed something like a circular light kind of pulsing for approx. 13 seconds and moving sort of in a straight line but not exactly in the northern part of the sky. There were some small trees around me and a field and then I looked away for a short second and the circular light was gone. During the time I saw it, I noticed that my dog became very still and began barking at the sky.;45.6360000000002;-94.2170000000002
