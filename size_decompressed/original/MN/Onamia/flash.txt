flash seen at same time in different parts of state.;2011-01-12 18:40:00;seconds;flash seen at same time in different parts of state. Just after supper I saw a quick flash out my front window.  I thought It may be lighting. I had never seen it in the middle of January but had heard it's possible.  I went out after I saw the flash. I noticed no clouds or other strange happenings.  Really unsure as to what it was.  One of my neighbors had worte on facebook that she had seen it too.  Throughout the thread we saw that about 4 others had seen it throughout hte state.  A very curious thing.  Would like some input.  Thank you!;46.0865;-93.6933
