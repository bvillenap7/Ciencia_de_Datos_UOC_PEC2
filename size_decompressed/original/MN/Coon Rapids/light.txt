FOLLOWED IN VEHICLE BY A BRIGHT LIGHT RESEMBLING A STAR;2002-11-28 05:00:00;1 HOUR 15 MINUTES;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the following report describes Venus in the eastern sky, although that is an educated guess.  Unless the witnesses saw TWO bright lights in the eastern sky at 0500 hrs., the light they were observing, we feel, must have been Venus.  However, please look at the next report from Cumberland, RI, for this date.  PD)) FOLLOWED IN VEHICLE BY A BRIGHT LIGHT RESEMBLING A STAR DRIVING ALONG STATE HWY 35W COMING HOME TO COON RAPIDS FROM HINKLEY MINNESOTA, THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE NOTICED TO THE EAST A BRIGHT LOW HANGING LIGHT. IT WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT, LOOKED LIKE A STAR AT FIRST. IT WAS TOO CLOSE TO BE A STAR. IT PROCEEDED TO COME CLOSER TO THE HIGHWAY. WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS AN AIRPLANE. BEFORE EXITING OFF TO HIGHWAY 10, WE SUPSPECTED IT WAS NIETHER AN AIRPLANE OR A HELICOPTER. IT ZIG-ZAGED, AND WENT FROM BEING VERY CLOSE TO US, TO LOOKING LIKE A DISTANT STAR WITHIN SECONDS, THEN CLOSE AGAIN. WHEN WE GOT ONTO HIGHWAY 10 GOING WEST, IT LOOKED AS IF IT WAS GOING TO KEEP GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, THEN QUICKLY TURNED AND WAS FOLLOWING US FROM BEHIND. WE HAD EVEN IN FACT, PASSED A SMALL AIRPORT, ON HIGHWAY 10, WHICH WE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD LAND, BUT IT KEPT FOLLOWING OUR VEHICLE. THERE WERE NO BLINKING RED OR BLUE LIGHTS, THAT WOULD INDICATE A FAMILIAR AIR CRAFT. WHEN WE GOT TO STREET EXIT, HANSON BLVD., WE PULLED OVER IN A VACANT PARKING LOT. WE OBSERVED THE U.F.O. HOVERING TO THE EAST, STAYING AS A BIG BRIGHT LIGHT TO JUST A SPEC IN THE GALAXY. WHEN DRIVER PROCEEDED TO DROP ME OFF AT MY HOME, AS SOON AS I GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE, THE LIGHT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER, UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED. I WENT INTO THE HOUSE JUST FOR A MOMENT, THEN CAME BACK OUT, I SAW THE SPEC IN THE SKY. THE DRIVER THEN PROCEEDED TO HER RESIDENCE, NOT SEEING IT THE ENTIRE WAY HOME, UNTIL SHE PULLED DOWN HER STREET, WHICH IS ABOUT 15 MINUTES NORTH TO ANDOVER, WHERE SHE SAW THE LIGHT BEHIND HER HOUSE. IT WAS BIG, BRIGHT, AND HANGING LOW. IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS SHAPED LIKE AN ARROW HEAD ALMOST FROM THE LIGHT.;45.16155;-93.309625
Bright light in Coon Rapids;2011-07-07 22:40:00;2 minutes;Bright light in Coon Rapids First it looked like a normal airplane in the sky flying over from the airport.  I noticed that it was moving a lot faster than the normal plane.  As I kept watching, it got really bright and then disappeared.;45.16155;-93.309625
Lights that traveled across the sky then disappeared and then from the same spot reappeared but in a new direction.;2012-04-10 22:00:00;20 Minutes;Lights that traveled across the sky then disappeared and then from the same spot reappeared but in a new direction. April 10, 2012  I live in Coon Rapids, MN. Around 10pm on two different occasions my wife and I have seen something in the skies that we really cannot explain. We have seen lights, which at first I thought were satellites, traveling along and then they just disappeared. We continued to watch that area and then a few minutesâ€™ later two lights came out of that same area traveling in totally different directions. For the two nights I have seen this happen I have about a total of 10 of these lights that are on a straight line just disappear and then minutes later appear but traveling in whole new direction. The one time the light I seen and was watching disappeared and about 10 minutes late a bright flash came from the area were the light disappeared, and a new light came from the flash and headed in the exact opposite direction. I have no clue what this is but it would be nice to find out.  I am going to try to film this if it ever happens again.;45.16155;-93.309625
5 LIGHTS BECOME 12 IN FORMATION.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-25 04:30:00;20 minutes;5 LIGHTS BECOME 12 IN FORMATION Let dog out and noticed how beautiful the starts were. Started watching lights quite a distance away to the east ( 3 to 5) As I watched them they arched to the left on the higher end of the horizon. I noticed one stationary object(Think it may of been Mars due to reddish tint but not sure)  The lights followed each other in an arch from low horizon to high and then back down. 5 of them now on the first pass. As I watched the three appeared to become 5. No sound. They vanished from sight. As I took care of my dog, maybe two minutes later I saw the five lights again. They all started doubling into 2 lights each. Before they were gone this time there where 9 lights now with the first one to the tail end being single. Again a few minutes went by after they vanished. They reappeared now. 12 OF THEM. EACH DOUBLED UP OVER THE TOP OF EACH OTHER, THIS TIME MOVING MUCH SLOWER, NOT FALLING BELOW THE HORIZON AND SLIGHTLY LARGER. THEY WERE ALL VERY DEFINED LIGHTS. I COUL! D EVEN SEE THEM CLEARLY WITHOUT MY GLASSES ON FOR A MOMENT. AND THEN THEY WERE GONE!!!;45.16155;-93.309625
