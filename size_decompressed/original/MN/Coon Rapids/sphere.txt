Three red orbs in the sky that slowly disappeared.;2015-04-23 21:30:00;2:30;Three red orbs in the sky that slowly disappeared. So, my friend and I were walking home from practice, my friend points out that there were three orbs in the sky.  They looked like stars but only red, and moving upwards.   They slowly disappeared one by one.   We didn't know where they went because it was a really clear night with no clouds.
