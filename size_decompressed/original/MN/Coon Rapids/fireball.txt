Ten fireball flying south to north over the span of 45 minutes.;2015-09-26 23:00:00;45 minutes;Ten fireball flying south to north over the span of 45 minutes. It was 11pm.  A friend I've known for about 15 years and I were out in his driveway talking.  Once before I saw something strange in the sky in our town. Looking up I noticed a fireball flying over the tree above us.  Seemed to have some aura coming off of it.  It was reddish/orange.  Directly overhead it was clearest.  That was when I immediately though fireball.  As it got further away it took on more of a disc shape and became a darker red. Minutes later another flew over from the same direction.  Exactly the same.  Then two more maybe 10 minutes later.  A few minutes later another two. Another 10 minutes or so came another two.  Showing up as two they were never side by side, always one before the other flying on the same flight path. The last two came one by one again like the first two (not paired) minutes between them.  All in all it lasted from 11pm-11:45pm (central). All I had with me was my cell phone but I shot three videos in the highest quality I could.  You can see a perfect disc shape as it got further away.  Zoomed way out in one of the videos to show houses for a little perspective. As an avid sky watcher I always have my eyes peeled!;45.16155;-93.309625
Several craft each glowing like fire and  triangular in shape.Slowly increased speed and vanished into the night sky.;2017-01-06 22:30:00;0:15;Several craft, each glowing like fire and  triangular in shape.  Slowly increased speed and vanished into the night sky. There were several craft coming from the North West sky in Coon Rapids, MN.  They were basically in a formation as far as travelling through the sky.  Some were single and some flew in pairs or in triple formation.  They were glowing bright orange almost like fireballs.  They were at a fairly low level and not at a great rate of speed.  Although as they passed overhead towards the Blaine Airport (Southern direction) their speed increased, the brightness of the fireball dimmed and they pretty much vanished into the night sky.  They were totally silent.  Stealth silent.  I tried to get their attention by the flashing light on my phone, but it did not really seem to affect the pattern they were travelling, or speed.  They pretty much paid no attention to it.  We stood outside hoping to see more flying over but no more were seen.  Very interesting.;45.16155;-93.309625
