The thing was as big as a football field.  It was V shaped. The lights were amber colored and what appeared to be dimmed.  The first thing I thought was How tricky of them.  They are trying to blend in with the street lights.  It had approx. fifteen sets of lights on each side except the first light which was a single one.  It was moving directly west.  It was so low that by the time I ran a half of a block I was directly behind it and it was getting blocked by the trees .  I really wanted to see if I could see the stars through the middle or not but to see if it was solid but it was passing through the trees.  I thought I may have.  Even though I didn't get to see it for very long, it was no doubt amazing and HUGE!  It's funny, but right before I saw it I had thought to myself It would be a good night to see a U.F.O. A couple of minutes later I saw it.  About a year later I heard some other people had seen a U.F.O. directly east of where I was and the same description.  The area I saw this in is a populated suburb of Minneapolis and was moving directly into the city of Anoka.  I wish I had known of your reporting network back then.  Even though it was 3:18 in the morning I had not been drinking.  I had been dropping a friend off at home. The craft was silent.  I found that amazing!;45.16155;-93.309625
