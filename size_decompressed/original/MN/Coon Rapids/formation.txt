formation of lights in a row very close.unmarked car showed up they took photos and left.;2010-07-18 01:00:00;3 hours;formation of lights in a row very close.unmarked car showed up they took photos and left. after the storm just like that other guy reported(he saw the same one). came out to smoke and this formation of bright lights were just hovering over neighbors house.no more than 300 to 500 feet up in the air.very close but you could only see lights you could not see what was in the middle of them.They started horizontilly then went verticle.It stayed there doing that and the lights were blinking in irratic patterns,at times it seemed like 6 lights then it would just look like 4.this is no made up story,the whole block on magnolia st was filled with people watching this in the middle of the night.cops came to try and break up the crowd,they said they also had another crowd at springbrook nature center.also an unmarked car came threw and two guys in suits got out and took pictures of it.They said they did not know what it was.after about 3 hours it slowly just floated higher and higher till you couldn't see it anymore.on a side note my buddy tryed to record it! more than 10 times and all that showed up was a 20second video and 3 still photos.ther were a lot of people recording it and all that has been on the internet is a 15second crappy video on youtube.I think it looked excactly like the pheonix lights ufo in arizona(very popular video). I take this whole thing very seriously,and I want someone to investigate it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.16155;-93.309625
