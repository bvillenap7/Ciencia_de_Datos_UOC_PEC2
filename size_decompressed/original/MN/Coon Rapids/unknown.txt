Not a plane flashing.  Very high up like a satellite.  Would flash at irregular intervals. Bright white flash similar to an iridium flare. Continued heading east-southeast and got very dim.  Could no longer see it after some time.  I was unable to capture the object on video but did take photos when it flashed.;45.16155;-93.309625
