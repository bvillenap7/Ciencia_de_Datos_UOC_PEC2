Flying v with lights around parimeter;2010-04-16 21:30:00;5-7 SECONDS;Flying v with lights around parimeter At first I thought it was one large craft, but it is possible that it could have been multiple. it had no sound lights surrounded the parimeter in a v shape with the front being the point of the v. the lights seemed to be flying completely in unison that is what made me think initially that is was one craft.there were madbe 5 or so lights per side with the same number on each side. the lights, as far as i know did not change colors. I believe it was fairly low and was traveling north west. I do not believe in alliens of space crafts but this cannot be explained by anything else and it makes me question everything i believe in.;45.807;-96.4858
