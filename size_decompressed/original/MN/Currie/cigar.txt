Metallic, cigar-shaped craft over Eastrn Murray County, MN.;2002-07-03 14:10:00;4 minutes;Metallic, cigar-shaped craft over Eastrn Murray County, MN. It was about 2pm on July 3rd, 2002.  There 6 of us, 2 kids (3 y/o girl, my 7y/o son) & 4 adults (aged 22-29 at the time).  We were on a farmsite, 1 mi E, and 1/2 mile N of Currie, MN.  It was a clear sunny 80 degree day, with very few clouds.  We had just shot off some fireworks, but nothing aerial, just small group reporters (black cat firecrackers) and some colored smoke bombs. My friend 1st noticed the craft to the northeast, and asked what it was.  When we first saw the metallic cigar shaped craft, it appeared to be about a mile away, moving toward us steadily and slowly.  Not knowing the object's size, I'm just guessing at these distances. It got to a distance that appeared to be about 400ft.  It looked like it was rather large, like could have been the size of the Goodyear blimp.  The shape was not blimp-shaped, more cigar & shiny, possibly surrounded by a haze, but it may have been sun glare of the craft's shiny exterior.  Again I do not know how big it was, nor the exact distances. As we pointed out the craft to the others they came over toward us.  At this point the craft just stopped and hovered.  There was no sound, no wind, just the shiny object floating. We all agreed that we had no idea what we were looking at.  I asked my son to fetch the binoculars.  As he ran back to the house the object stayed, when he started running back with the binoculars the craft flew away silently, steadily, and rapidly to the northeast until we could no longer see it.;44.0957;-95.6898
