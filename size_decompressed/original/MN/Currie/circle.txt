Meteor stops and changes direction and magnitude;2020-11-04 19:30:00;8 minutes;Meteor stops and changes direction and magnitude Sighting took place November fourth, 2020 at Lake Shetek State Park in Southern Minnesota.  The park is located two miles northwest of the town of Currie in Murray County.  Park is located where in August of 1862 massacre of settlers took place during the US Dakota War. Observation of unidentified object took place while I was lying on my cot looking up at the constellation Cygnus. As I was looking up at Cygnus two meteors shot across the constellation traveling north to south.  One of the meteors trailed closely behind the other. Both had the magnitude in brightness as currently does the star Deneb.  There was a slight variation in the direction as one took a straight southerly route and the other a slight shift to the South South East.  As a comparison they were separated in distance by using an out stretched arm and looking at the small finger. At this point to me they appeared as meteors until the lead object rapidly decelerated and stop.  When it stopped in the central west area of Cygnus the object dimmed in magnitude.  Then slowing it began moving west or at a right angle from its previous direction.  At this point I took notice wondering what had just happened.  As it traveled past several stars it again stopped.  At this point I called a friend by phone to discuss what was taking place.  Again the object stopped and after a brief interlude changed direction and started slowing moving south towards the constellation Delphinus.  Shortly thereafter it drifted out of view.
