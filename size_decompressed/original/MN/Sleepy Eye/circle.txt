Tiny Metallic object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a high-altitude balloon, launched by DARPA?  PD));2019-08-28 18:34:00;15 minutes;Tiny Metallic object. Saw a tiny metallic object in the south sky at 6:35.  It was very hard to see because it was just a speck in the sky.  The only reason I even spotted it was it reflected sunlight off it.  It stayed there in the sky for around 15 minutes until I could no longer see it.  It wasn’t a plane because it wasn’t moving and had no vapor trail.   I checked my Skyview app to see if it was a planet or the moon, and it wasn’t.;44.2853;-94.7376
