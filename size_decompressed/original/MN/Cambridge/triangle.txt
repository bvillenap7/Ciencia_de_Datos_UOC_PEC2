Three lights in a triangular formation;2012-01-08 18:00:00;Few Min.;Three lights in a triangular formation I was coming home from my brothers house, and was a couple of miles outside of Cambridge, MN, on highway 95 heading east.  The sky was clear, with a big full moon illuminating the sky.   All of a sudden, I saw a flash of light in the sky to my left.  I looked up and saw 3 lights in a triangular shape.  It was maybe 150 to 200 feet in the air.  In between the lights I could see a solid metal shape.  It was moving slowly, and floated across the road just in front of me.  There was no sound.  After it had passed across the road I looked to my right and could see it for a short period of time. There was a vehicle behind me on the road that must have seen it too.  Wish I had pulled over and watched it further.   I guess I was kind of afraid, so I just kept driving.;45.5563;-93.2836000000001
There were triangle shaped amber lights hovering over the trees.;2013-04-30 09:30:00;10 minutes;There were triangle shaped amber lights hovering over the trees On 4/30/2013 at 9:30pm, my husband, daughter and I were driving home from bingo.  When we were a few miles from our house we saw two sets of red lights with an amber colored light blinking. as we passed by them, they seemed to be hovering above our neighbors back yard, about three tree lengths into the sky.  it appeared to be two triangular objects with a row of lights on the end, two red on each end with the blinking orange amber in the middle. there was no sound, they weren't moving, but just &quothanging&quot there.  This is only right down the road from where we live, and we have never seen anything like this.  My husband said they MUST have put up a couple of towers for something, as way too low to be aircraft, and weren't moving at all.  I said if there were towers they would have to be in someone's yard, that's how close they were!  When daylight came, we drove down there and there is no tower, nothing.  We also went back the next two nights and nothing, no lights, nothing but starry sky!;45.5563;-93.2836000000001
