ENCOUNTERED UFO THAT APPROACHED WITHIN 50 FEET, WAS 30 FEET WIDE AND REMAINED FOR OVER 30 MINUTES.;1999-07-31 00:30:00;32 minutes;ENCOUNTERED UFO THAT APPROACHED WITHIN 50 FEET, WAS 30 FEET WIDE AND REMAINED FOR OVER 30 MINUTES. FIRST ENCOUNTERED THE OBJECT SOME 1000 FEET DISTANT UP THE ROAD AT THE TOP OF A HILL.  IT CAME DOWN THE ROAD EAST TO WEST VERY SLOWLY NEAR TO THE GROUND.  IT HAD 7 LARGE LIGHTS 4 BELOW, AND 3 ABOVE.  THESE LIGHTS WERE WHITE WITH THIN RAYS RADIATING ALL AROUND.  THEY WERE VERY BRIGHT BUT ONLY CASTE A BLUE REFLECTION ON THE TREES AND ROAD.  I STOOD IN THE ROAD AS IT CAME TOWARDS ME.  IT STOPPED SOME 200 FEET DISTANT AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS.  THERE WAS NO SOUND.  I STUDIED THE OBJECT FOR SOME 10 OR 15 MINUTES AND THEN BEGAN TO MOVE TOWARDS IT SLOWLY.  AS I APPROACHED TO WITHIN 50 FEET IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY BACKWARDS UNTIL IT WAS IN LINE WITH MY NEIGHBORS DRIVEWAY THAT CUT A SWATH IN THE PINETREES.  AS I WAS APPROACHING CLOSER IT SUDDENLY SHOT SIDEWAYS UP THE DRIVEWAY AND INTO THE SKY AT INCREDIBLE SPEED.  THE ONLY SOUND WAS A PPPPHHHTTTT!!!!  AS IT SHOT AWAY.  I FELT NO BACKDRAFT OR MOVEMENT IN THE AIR.    IT HAD JUST QUIT RAINING THAT EVENING AND I TOOK A FLASHLIGHT AND CHECKED THE ROAD FOR TRACKS--THERE WERE NONE.  ONLY ROCKS HAD SLID FROM THE CENTER OF THE ROAD TO THE SIDES IN THE WET GRAVEL.  I WENT HOME.  THE NEXT MORINING I FOUND A DEAD SKUNK BY THE ROAD WITH THE HAIR STRANDS CORRECTLY IN PLACE BUT NO BODY, SKIN, OR BONES.  THERE WAS A WET SPOT SURROUNDING THE REMAINS.   I TOOK A PHOTO OF THIS PHENOMENON.  A FEW NIGHTS LATER AT 3:00 I AWOKE TO A BEATIFUL LIGHT WITH PINK AND BLUE SWIRLS IN IT.  I FOUND I HAD A TRIANGULAR BURN ON MY LEFT WRIST THAT LASTED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AS A BURN AND IS STILL ON MY ARM TODAY.  SOMETIMES IT GROWS FROM ONE CENTIMETER TO OVER AN INCH AS A PINK RASH.  THERE ARE 3 POINTS AT THE CORNERS.  THERE WERE SEVERAL RELATED EXPERIENCES THAT SUMMER WITH WITNESSES INCLUDING MY OWN SON.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  I WISH TO ADD MY PUZZLEMENT THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE LITTLE OR NO INTEREST IN MY STORY WHICH I FEEL WAS QUITE SINGULAR--PLUS THE FACT THAT I AM AN INTERNATIONAL ARTIST WHO HAD A GREAT AMOUNT OF TIME TO VISUALLY RECORD THE SIGHTING.  I HAVE PAINTED A PHOTOGRAPHIC LIKENESS OF THE CRAFT WHICH NO ONE SEEMS INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT.  FURTHERMORE, I SEEK NO PERSONAL RECOGNITION IN THIS CASE AND AM QUITE CONTENT TO REMAIN INCOGNITO.;46.9997;-94.7195
encountered 33 foot ufo in road close as 20 feet for over 30 minutes duration other evidence w/ photo;2004-07-30 11:00:00;30 minutes;encountered 33 foot ufo in road close as 20 feet for over 30 minutes duration other evidence w/ photo Object approached within 30 feet of me and then stopped.  I stood for 25 minutes in front of it recording mentally the lights and configuration.  It was over a gravel road just after a rain so there were nn tracks in the road just rocks that had slid sideways.  I then stepped forward towards it and it backed up 20 feet and then shot off to the right through a break in the trees.  It made no sound.  and left in a flash making a pppphhhhtttt sound as it departed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));46.9997;-94.7195
