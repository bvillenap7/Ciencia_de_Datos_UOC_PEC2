T;2007-06-13 17:30:00;45 Seconds;At approximately 1730 hours on 06/13/07 I observed a White glowing Cigar shaped craft to the east of downtown St. Paul heading north. The object did not have any wings and appeared to be glowing a white radiant white light all around it even in broad daylight it was very bright. As it proceeded north it began to disapear slowly into the blue sky. I was watching commercial airliners all over during this time and this was not a airliner I am sure of that much. However it seemed to be about the same size as one but with no wings or markings. Airliners don't glow except when the sunlight is reflecting off of them. This was not the case however.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
