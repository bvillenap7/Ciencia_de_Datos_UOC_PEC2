White circular object observed 2.5 handspans above horizon for 4+ hours by 8 people in St. Paul, MN.;2004-08-19 17:00:00;>=4 hrs;White circular object observed 2.5 handspans above horizon for 4+ hours by 8 people in St. Paul, MN. Some friends and I were all at a backyard barbeque and one of the guys there asked if I had seen the UFO yet.  I was puzzled and he explained that on WCCO they had reported a white floating thing that hadn't moved for hours.  We all went outside and watched it for a good for hours while we cooked up our food.  The neighbors in the next door yard had a pair of 7x35 binoculars they were using to look at the object and let us take a look.  I saw what appeared to be a pale white orb that was a bit stretched out on the top side.  Like a blunted teardrop, kind of.  The object appeared to be stationary but during the course of our BBQ, it appeared to have moved from 12 o'clock to about 10 o'clock at a uniform height of 2.5 handspans (arms extended) above the horizon. A dime held at arms length completely obscured the object. I believe that even a popcorn kernel held at arm's length would have covered it.  3 of the 8 of us had about 3 beers apiece over the course of the 4 hours.  As to our credibility, we are all of sound mind.  I am a military veteran, one of the guys there is a Mennonite/Quaker type guy, one lady is a research biologist, and another works in a health diagnostic lab.  The remainder were college students. Everyone there was of a rational mindset.  In summary -- 8 of us saw something in the sky that we can't quite explain.  The idea of a balloon was (forgive the pun) floated but the object was far too stationary for that to be true.  Also, it should be noted that as the sun set, the object, suspended above the western horizon, remained consistently luminous -- a large white circloid with no noticable shading.  To be honest, we got bored with it after a while and ceased to pay attention to it.  Prior to this we noted it had been drifting relative to the trees.  Left to right, facing west.  When we wondered about it's position around 2100 hours, we weren't able to find it. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date indicated above is correct, but a similar event occurred near the Twin Cities on August 19.  We will contact the witness for clarification.  Several news outlets reported the incident, and it remains unexplained, according to two of those media, as of September 8, 2004.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter-   Yeah, it was Aug 19...the day everyone around here was seeing it.  Sorry about that, I don't usually keep track of the date.  It was all over the radio, TV...and then interest just disappeared.  Odd, you'd think that folks would be interested in knowing what the heck was just floating stationary for such a long period of time.  Most folks just dismissed it with weather balloon.  It might have been but it certainly didn't exhibit balloon like properties, chiefly that whole not moving thing.   Let me know if you learn any more about the flying object that has, to date, been unidentified.   Cheers!  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
This item is from WCCO news in Minneapolis Mn;2004-08-19 19:00:00;not sure;This item is from WCCO news in Minneapolis Mn There's an unknown object hovering in the sky over the Twin Cities, and it doesn't appear to be a bird or a plane.  Meteorologist Tony Zaleski of the National Weather Service in Chanhassen says the white object appears to be higher than the white, whispy cirrus clouds, which means it's probably higher than 30,000 feet.  Although the object looked like it might be rotating, it doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Zaleski says that probably would rule out a satellite.  Patrick Hogan at the Metropolitan Airports Commission says folks in the tower at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport thought it might be a weather balloon. But Zaleski says if that's true, the Weather Service didn't release it.  The Federal Aviation Administration hasn't returned calls about the mysterious object. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the Twin Cities area.  At first, we thought the object might be a balloon, launched from Canada, as part of the MANTRA scientific project, but the balloon had not yet been launched on August 19.  The local news media covered the event extensively.  We do not know what the object, or objects, were.  Please see other reports.  PD));44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886

Six uniform white lights in St Paul, Minnesota.  Near the Saints stadium.;2013-07-30 20:40:00;5 minutes;Six uniform white lights in St Paul, Minnesota.  Near the Saints stadium. Amazing. There was a line of six white lights. Each was following behind the other in a symmetrical uniform row. Me and another person watched from our apartment balcony as each light followed the other and disappeared above the low hanging clouds. The lights were flying low, but I could not gage a measurement in feet of how high they were. The lights eye site wise were the size of twinkling white dots, but not far away like stars, close enough to where you could see them, as you would a low hanging storm cloud. There was no sound, they flowed ( for a lack of a better word ) upward in the sky and disappeared above the clouds. This is my first time ever seeing anything like this.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886

Was driving home on 494W after leaving Perkins (off France St), and saw a Huge Circle shape (Left of Highway).  It had several faded lights creating this circle, and it looked as though it was in a cloud or fog. It was not moving.  I was driving, - so I called my cousin who was driving a mile or two behind me.  She saw it too. There was a recent bad car accident, so I was unable to pull over anywhere to take a photo safely. I saw an airplane flying (at airport) and it was TINY compared to this object.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
Five lights in a line moving N to S diminished in brightness until invisible.;2015-12-20 15:22:00;1 minute;Five lights in a line moving N to S diminished in brightness until invisible. I was walking my dog along the railroad track, two blocks east of where the tracks go over Como ave..  I saw points of light in the sky in the North moving N to S in a line.  These lights formed a rough, not perfect, line.  All moved uniformly and in sync WRT velocity.   My suspicions were raised when I realized no sound was being emitted, contrary to my initial belief that they were military helicopters in formation.   As the four of them passed overhead, the second to the vanguard diminished in brightness and in doing so began emitting a redder light until finally it disappeared.   I then noticed more movement to the North and observed a fifth apparently catching up because of it's slightly higher rate of speed.  At this point there were only four and all continued in the same vector at the same speed.  After a short time, as with the first one, all began disappearing. Each light had a bright center and was enveloped in a fuzzy glow. I felt elated and surprised. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

There were a couple of them and one had a pulsating thing in the middle.  We could see additional black things on the outer edges.  It was moving at a slow rate, because of the distance from the earth, after hovering for over an hour.  It was seen in the western sky and move slightly southwest an hour later and then a couple of hours later is was further west. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.

It wouldn't suprise me if it was moving 500 mph.  I just caught a glimpse of it.  It was so bright and fast that it was impossible to not see.  Definitely not a star as it was too big, bright, and it maintained its speed.  I also doubt a failing star could be seen in the inner city.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
