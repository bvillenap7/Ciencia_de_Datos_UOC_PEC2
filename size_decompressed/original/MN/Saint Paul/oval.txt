Fireworks and UFO, MN State Fair Grounds July 4th late 70's early 80's.;1980-07-04 22:00:00;30 minutes;Fireworks and UFO, MN State Fair Grounds July 4th late 70's early 80's. State Fair Grounds  It was late 70’s early 80’s on July 4th at the State Fair grounds. Thousands of people were watching fireworks in the bleachers and parked out in the fields in our cars.  I was with my X husband.  I was laying on the hood, my back against the windshield.  (No alcohol was involved)  We were all watching fireworks when I noticed the sky coming down, closer.  When I realized something was happening I couldn’t move.  I realized it was a HUGE ufo that was passing slowly east to west.  It was so low you could see how it was riveted together, the seams of the craft and all the lighting. It made no sound.  I was scared to death and finally leaned to the right and fell off the car. I wanted to hide under the car.  I could only get near the tire.  I wanted to scream but couldn’t.  I realized I was not suppose to remember this happening.  I kept telling myself I will remember, I will remember.  The craft size was huge, bigger than the fairgrounds bleacher area where they hold concerts! and races.  It started to rise up while heading west.  After a period of time I heard a launch of a fire work, then slowly another.  Little by little people started moving, and talking (oohs and aaahs)  I was able to slowly get up and I asked my X if he remembered it.  He said yes, but acted like he was in a trance.  We went home, I insisted and we each drew pictures of the object that matched.  For years when I would mention this story I knew deep down I wasn’t suppose to talk about.  I know I am not suppose to remember this.  But I do.  It is simple I know what I know.  I expected it to be on the news and in the paper.  Nothing!  I would have thought it would have showed up on radar or something. For years I have wondered if someone who was there just like me remembers. For years I have just said I know what I know.  I don’t care who believes it I just know.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
Hovering object over Lunar eclipse moon.;2014-04-15 22:00:00;~1 hour;Hovering object over Lunar eclipse moon Came home from school and noticed that there was going to be a lunar eclipse.   As I was driving all I could see was the moon but once I got home and sat down with my sisters we noticed something hovering to the right of the moon.  We thought it may have been a star or a plan but saw flickering red flickering lights.   It then moved and aligned itself with the moon, moving way above hovering and looking down on the moon.  It has not moved for 30 minutes to an hour now but from time to time will slightly move in a zigzag motion but will go back to the same place.
