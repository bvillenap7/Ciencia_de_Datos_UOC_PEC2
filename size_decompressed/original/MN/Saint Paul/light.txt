I was on the way home from work, and saw what i thought might be a meteor. but it was the wrong color (yellow), and moving too slowly, and in the wrong direction (straight down, as opposed to horizontally). It was a little larger than the other stars, and bright yellow, it was the movement and color that caught my eye. It dropped to a point in front of me, and about 45 deg from the horizon, stopped, then apparently divided into 4 sections (as it was just a point of light, i say apparently), then each section made a bit of an s-curve away from each other, and departed in 4 different directions, roughly 90 deg from each other. At the time i thought it interesting, and didn't mention it to anyone. Could this be a ufo sighting? please resopnd via e-mail.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
ufo encounter with missing time;1980-09-27 21:00:00;2 hrs;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ufo encounter with missing time well here we go this happened about 21 years ago on our  way to hudson wisconsin from the east side of st paul me and a friend were travelling east on 94 from the east side of st paul this trip normally takes 30 minutes max  it was about 8.00 pm when we left roccos resturant on the east side to go to hudson harbor resturant to pick up some supplies my friends dad owned both places. we were apporx 5 miles east of st paul when I noticed a light hovering in the sky I said lets get a closer look so me and my freind(he was driving) pulled off on a dirt road to the south approx 1/4 mile off the road and stopped we were right under the light it was about 200-250 feet above the car  and we  sat there for a while when all of a sudden it shot over the highway to the north and when it did this it was so fast that all we could see was a light trial and then shot back over our car it did this approx five times shooting around the sky leaving light trails and always returning back above our car we both just sat there amazed at what was happening we could not beleive it.we sat there for approx 10-15 min observing this strange light in the sky then it shot out and became five lights if you pictured a star on the american flag with its five points threre was a light at every point if you can picture this with the car in the center. then all of a sudden it shot straight up as fast as ever and was gone just leaving a trail of lights as it shot away. well we both decided to get the hell out of there. and go to hudson and pick up our stuff. the strangest thing was yet to come when we got there we walked downstairs to the prep kitchen and it was 10.15 pm this was so wierd because this trip is 20-30 min max and we were on the side of the road 15- 20 min max well we did not know what happened to the other time it was missing I donot remember anything more happening to us but there was for sure at least an hour of missing time. giving my self extra for how long ago it happened. i ran into my buddy about six months ao he does n! ot remem ber anything about it. this is extremly bizarre because I rememeber it all it make me think i am a little crazy but I know what happened and this was for sure a true event;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
small airplane like, light, all of a sudden turn hugh and then speed off like a shooting star.;2001-01-05 22:00:00;30 seconds;small airplane like, light, all of a sudden turn hugh and then speed off like a shooting star. It appeared to be an airplane.It looked like a star/ airplane lights- just the main ones, not the collored lights. I saw it in the sky to my left going east on hwy110. It got really bright as if it was coming my direction. All of a sudden it blew up to approximately 10-20 times the size. A second later it speed off to the right (going south) really fast. It was really high in the sky, I think. It at first looked like a comet, but I would have heard of it, they don't come that close to earth, and when it speed of it apeared to be a shooting star. I think it had a greenish tint to it when it moved, not when it exploded though. It all happened sort of fast, but I can not explain it. I have saw another ufo a year or so ago, but I did not report it. But I would really like to know if any one else saw it/ what it is.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
Twelve star-like objects viewed in random patterns over St. Paul, Minnesota;2001-07-23 03:30:00;1 hour;Twelve star-like objects viewed in random patterns over St. Paul, Minnesota I have been spotting Chemtrails, the last three years. In my line of work, I am able to watch the entire metro skies from the roof of the heating plant , where I'm employed. At 0330 this morning, I began looking for high altitute aircraft and weather patterns. My first observation was what looked like a satellite. It was moving slowly from Northwest to Southeast. I watched it's straight line path until it was out of sight . I then turned around to view west again and I saw a bright star-like object, traveling from west to east . It was to my north and as bright as Saturn. It was not an airplane. It had no flashing lights.  It appeared lower and larger than the satellite I had just seen, but higher than the hazy cloud patterns present. I was so amazed at this object and was semi- scared by it's appearance. Suddenly there was another object right behind the first. As if they were flying in formation. Both objects were on the same course and speed. The first object was brighter than the second and I watched   them disappear in the eastern sky. I have been in the military during Viet Nam and spent my entire life around airplanes. Never have I seen such craft. I sat down and was in semi-shock trying to measure what I had just seen. Then I noticed another satellite object coming towards me from the north. I watched it, until it vanished overhead. (no cloulds near) After straining to see where it might have gone, a small red flash appeared. I'm thinking to myself now and wondering just what is going on...I radioed down to my work partner, to get upstairs and see the show that was going on. He arrived in two minutes and I explained my observations. He also has seen these on occasion and the couple he has observed didn't always move in a straight line but eratic patterns. We both began watching now and within two minutes I noticed another bright satellite object moving towards us from the west. I pointed it out to him and he caught sight of it, also. Then this object faded from a very bright light to nothing, r! ight abo ve us. Within less than an a hour, 12 objects were seen until cloud cover and the brightening sunrise took over.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
Bright light hovers for hours in broad daylight,  thousands of people see it.;2004-08-19 17:00:00;3 hours;Bright light hovers for hours in broad daylight,  thousands of people see it. I saw this object in the middle of the day, the sun was shining, the sky was bright blue. THOUSANDS of people across all of the metropolitan area viewed this object for half a day, until the sun went down.  there were numerous phone calls to local news stations, as well as the mentioning of it on local news channels.  The object was a bright white point of light, and was VERY slowly moving in a westerly direction. the object was higher then high (cirus) clouds, which passed infront of it.  A local Weatherman thought it was a stationary high altitude balloon. and had fuzzy pictures taken with a telephoto lens to prove it. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the Twin Cities area.  At first, we thought the object might be a balloon, launched from Canada, as part of the MANTRA scientific project, but the balloon had not yet been launched on August 19.  The local news media covered the event extensively.  We do not know what the object, or objects, were.  Please see other reports.  PD));44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
9/2/04 On a clear blue sky evening I noticed a bright star that seemed to be going straight into the atmosphere.;2004-09-02 19:45:00;1- 2 minutes;9/2/04 On a clear blue sky evening I noticed a bright star that seemed to be going straight into the atmosphere. I was sitting on my patio at dusk and as I looked straight up I noticed a bright star or planet.  But, what was strange is there were no other stars/planets around because it was still light out.  So, I was just watching the bright star shaped object.  Thinking that maybe it was some sort of reflection from a high flying plane.  But, it wasn't changing direction or flickering.  As I stared at it trying to get my roomate to look at it.  I noticed that it seemed to be going into the atmosphere.  It was getting dimmer and dimmer.  Until it disappeared.  But, it wasn't like the light source was dimming.  It was like it was being enveloped by the atmosphere.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
Orange points of light racing South from Perseus at great speed and altitude slowing, speeding, passing each other.;2007-10-31 02:15:00;.5-.75 Minute;Orange points of light racing South from Perseus at great speed and altitude slowing, speeding, passing each other. I was out observing Comet 17p/Holmes, again. I spotted it again tonight and it is a bit fainter maybe magnitude 3 now also more dispersed.  Look in the East (just North of East really) find Cassiopeia  above the area Capella, the brightest star in the East, below and the seven sisters (Plieades - a little tiny dipper) to the South, in the middle between all those is an equilateral triangle of close to the same magnitude stars -the fuzzy dirtball is on the lower left- obviously hazy through binoculars. I just witnessed my first UFOs these two lights passed near the comet at an apparent altitude similar to the ISS/Space-Shuttle (which I saw a couple nights ago) silent, orange color points of light and chasing, slowing, speeding, passing- speeds that ranged from faster than ISS to full stopped on a dime and then 90 degree instant turns East and gone.    This was unlike any heavenly body not even meteors move like this.  Human's Jets could not move with such speed especially in the turning, no Earthly flight technology can slow down like these did.   I cannot rule out plasmas but plasma still has to follow the rules of physics regarding inertia, energy conservation and acceleration.   I followed these with my binoculars for perhaps half to three-fourths of a minute.  The initial direction was South out of Perseus away from the comet when I first noticed them.   I have no explanation for these 2 things.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
large white bright light moving through night time sky;2008-08-21 04:00:00;10 minutes;large white bright light moving through night time sky im guessing it might of been the ISS but im not for sure. but one night after the bar we were sitting in a friends hot tub.. the big dipper was directly behind me...i i was facing away from the big dipper but if i tilted my head back i could see it from upside down angle. as i was lookin at the dipper i looked over to my left an noticed a huge light. no sound or blinking lights it moved at the speed as a satelite would move but the brightness of this object was bout 6-8 times bigger an brighter. this object did not change color or speed the object passed over us an went in same direction, didnt seem to change speeds we watched it till it went over the horizon. im thinkin it was ISS, but not for sure. i know it wasnt a normal satelite cuz it was so huge. if any one could possibly identify what i seen or maybe seen the same object we did. im not 100% sure on the date but it was a friday morning it was 2,3 rd week in aug. the object was circle shaped an white b! right light.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
Fast shooting light through the clouds over Lake Owasso;2009-01-02 19:30:00;3 seconds;Fast shooting light through the clouds over Lake Owasso Two of us were standing around a bonfire on the ice last Friday evening. There were quite a few ice fishermen out on Lake Owasso but most people were in their ice houses. The sky was cloudy as is typical in winter, except that the horizons were clear just a little over the tree tops. I was facing west and my buddy west/northwest. As we stood around talking, something caught my eye just above us and to the south. I looked up expecting to see a shooting star. Instead it was a green-ish/blue-ish egg shaped light streaking through the clouds. It lasted for about three seconds and then vanished. I initially thought that it was a shooting star because of the speed that the light moved across the sky. I immediately concluded that it was not a shooting star because the dense clouds overhead prohibited our view of any stars. Winter clouds in Minnesota are low to the ground and shooting stars occur high in the atmosphere. The light appeared to be the size of a large airplane (like a military cargo plane) but it was tough to gauge its size because it was hard to judge distance between the clouds and the ground. After initially thinking that the light was a shooting star, my next conclusion was that it was a flare. However, the light was much bigger than a flare, and was traveling horizontally at a constant rate and altitude. Flares also don’t travel as fast as a shooting star. The light also did not look like any flare that I’ve ever seen and was not red or white. The light was moving just inside of the clouds. I could see bits of cloud between myself and the light. This makes me think that it wasn’t a flash light, strobe, or other projection onto the clouds since that type of light would not penetrate the clouds. It would reflect off of the clouds and not appear to be inside of the clouds as this light happened to be. It also did not have any of the normal attributes of northern lights, and appeared in the sky just to the south of our position. There was no noise created by the light, no trail of clouds or exhaust, and it disappeared just before reaching a clearing in the clouds. I suppose that it could have been some sort of bright gas ball, but I’ve never seen anything like that before. This light shot through the clouds and seemed to have defined edges (egg-shaped). The light never changed direction, speed, or altitude that I could tell. It just vanished at a certain point. I can’t say that it was a craft of any sort because all that we saw was a fast moving light. Instantly though, we both knew that we had seen something odd. I don’t have an explanation for what we saw but can describe it quite well. My fishing buddy saw it for the last second or so and couldn’t come up with a good explanation for what we saw either.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
Possible UFO crash near St. Paul MN;2009-10-18 20:00:00;Several minutes;Possible UFO crash near St. Paul MN Shocking UFO Story PLEASE READ : 9:15pm 10/18/09: My dad shaking in amazement, tells me of a heart pounding event in which he witnesses 10-15 bright lights stretching above his head from his location on 694e toward 694 and Rice Street at approximately 8:00pm. Not long after he also witnesses a quiet American born fighter jet fly above head. In a panic he calls my cousin and aunt telling them of the incident. Well instead of waiting for my dad to come and pick them up to come and see for themselves my cousin and aunt go on their own mission knowing that UFO's do not stay around for long. Driving on 96 away from white bear lake my aunt and cousin recall an even more tragic side of the story in which an extremely bright white light hovers in the sky and suddenly as they are gazing upon the white light they see several lights burst away from this light and then the bright light suddenly is nonexistent .My aunt believes she saw an apparent UFO crash my dad be! lieves he did not see the UFO's themselves but instead he saw several helicopters and the obvious jet plane that flew above him in the sky. In two separate places my dad and family may have seen two separate occurrences. Who will ever know?;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
UFO in Minnesota at midnight;2011-08-26 00:00:00;10sec;UFO in Minnesota at midnight I was with a date looking up into the sky, my sunroof was open at the time in my car.  So I was looking thru the open sunroof.  Then I saw a light, I thought it was a plane or a very slow shooting star, but it was too slow for a shooting star.  I mentioned this to my date too.   It first flew straight for about 5 seconds, what caught me off guard is it changed course very rapidly, going sideways and then the other way and then it disappeared.  Right then I knew it was not a plane, not a shooting star or anything else that can make turns that fast at that distance.  The light was yellowish to white, it was far, at least a few miles high in the air.   My date didnt see this because she was laying on my chest cuddling, I did mention it to her as soon as it happened.  She just kinda blew it off.

Red and Green light bars seen at low elevation.;2013-12-25 22:38:00;25-35 seconds;Red and Green light bars seen at low elevation. This sighting occurred on 25 December 2013 at 22:38 hours Central Time (I have changed the other witnesses name for this record)  I am a taxi driver in Saint Paul, Minnesota.  I was dispatched to pick up a regular customer at a popular large night spot near Grand and Victoria Avenues.  I pulled into the long driveway that goes from Grand to the alley between Grand and Summit Ave.  I was facing north seated in my cab.  I saw John, the regular I was sent to pick up, standing in the patio area.  He was smoking a cigarette and talking to someone.  He held up his finger indicating I should wait a moment.  No problem, John is a very generous and regular customer so I had no problem giving him a moment to conclude his activities. I looked through the windshield and saw at about 25 degrees up two horizontal bars of light. The upper one was red, the lower was green.  They were of equal length. There appeared to be 8 or so bulbs in each bar, however the both bars were uniformly illuminated their respective colors so they may not have been bulbs.  There appeared to be a small reflection or dim light situated between the two bars.  The space between the two bars (where I saw the dim reflection/light) was about 2/3ds the height of the bars.  I cannot say the length of the bars but If I had to guess I'd say 20 feet, but since I didn't know how high up/far away the bars were dimensions are hard to speculate about. I did not seem very high up in elevation. I could not detect any body or outline behind the light bars.  The sky was the darkest navy blue/black it can probably be.  I have checked, and the moon was on the other side of the planet. So while I am noticing these lights John has made it around and clambered into the cab. I immediately ask John, John, what the hell is that? while pointing through the windshield at the light bars. At first he glanced and said, An airplane.  I then said,Doesn't look like any airplane I've ever seen.  Then there was a very brief pause. John then said,OH, WAIT. as he gathered in what he was looking at. Just a second or so before John got in the cab, the red light bar turned off, then turned on.  The green light bar followed suit.  John witnessed the second round of the bars turning off and on in turn. Once again - red off, red on, green off, green on.  At this point we are both just staring.  This is when the really odd bit comes in.  The light bars moved off to the northeast and disappeared behind the giant trees on Summit Ave. Now, I was in the Navy and I have seen, and even once, been on a helicopter. This did not move like a helicopter.  There was no gradient in the speed.  By this I mean it went from completely stationary to moving off at, I'd say 40 mph.  I heard no noise at all. John audibly gasped when it moved, I expect it is because it just didn't look right in terms of that kind of instantaneous movement it was at speed immediately.  It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up when those bars moved off like that. I have done some checking and no aircraft I can find has such illumination.  In fact using these color lights in this fashion is a violation of FAA regs.  According to my understanding green is meant to indicate the right wingtip/side only. John and I looked at each other with a HOLY S**t look on our faces.  I shook my head and put the cab in gear to take John to his destination.  We both scanned the sky to the north as we proceeded toward downtown.  We didn't see anything else in the sky the rest of the way to John's. I dropped John off, he didn't say anything.  He looked a little disturbed by our sighting. About 15 minutes or so after we saw the lights a low bank of clouds rolled in over the city.  This bank of clouds had a very distinct leading edge.  I thought these clouds a bit odd too. I sit here now wondering what it is I saw. Any ideas would be appreciated greatly.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886

Red Light Changing Color and Abruptly Stopping to Hover;2020-08-27 21:00:00;8 seconds;Red Light Changing Color and Abruptly Stopping to Hover A friend and I were sitting on the deck at my house.  We were looking at the moon facing south and out of nowhere this bright red light moved into view going west. It moved pretty fast and then abruptly stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  Then it moved up really quickly and again stopped.  The red light changed to a dim green color, then faded out into white at which point it changed back to bright red before moving west again.  It dropped down again and hovered a few seconds before quickly moving west and out of view. It was about 9:00 at night.  There were no clouds in the sky and it made no noise.  I don't know how high up in the sky it was but I'm guessing a height at which a small plane would fly.  There is a lot of air traffic here but I've never seen anything that would just suddenly stop and change color like this.  I can't figure out what this was!;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
