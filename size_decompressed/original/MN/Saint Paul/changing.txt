Shiny 'white dots' over Saint Paul that changed shape right in front of me before disappearing.;2015-04-11 14:00:00;20-30 seconds;Shiny 'white dots' over Saint Paul that changed shape right in front of me before disappearing. It is a beautiful, clear blue sky day.  My husband and I were driving down the road.  I was looking out of the open window when, at first glance I assumed were a flock of seagulls flying way too high, began to appear in greater numbers (out of nowhere) and seemed to fill up a circular slowly moving shape.  It appeared to glisten, as you would expect to see water glistening on a bright sunny day.  They were very very high up and slowly more and more of these white things began to appear causing the circle to grow bigger.  I would say around 20 of these appearing in the circle.  As I went to say aloud to my husband, what is that? it just looked to almost deflate.  It then took on a long cigar like shape and moved forward before disappearing for good.  While in the cigar-like shape the image was dark and clear in the center.  There were no white dots.  It completely changed form and was half the size of the previous circular form.  There is not one cloud in the sky.  There were no trees to block my view.  My window was down.  I saw this and it was like nothing I have ever seen.  I also have no good explanation of what it could have been.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
