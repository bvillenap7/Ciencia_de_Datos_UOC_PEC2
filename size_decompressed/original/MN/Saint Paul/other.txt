I was driving west on Minnehaha ave on the east side of St. Paul and suddenly straight down the middle of the road about 25 to 30 degrees up and about a half mile away was this bright aluminum colored object.I watched it for the length of time it took me to drive a city block or so, when I had to take my eyes off of it because I was meeting another car coming towards me, this was only a couple of seconds and when I looked up to look at it again, it was gone. The object was a bright aluminum color with a domed shaped top and a flat bottom. It was about twice as high as the diameter and was in the shape of a cylinder. The sides were not smooth, there were vertical lines running from bottom to top that seemed to be there to give the structure strength.Size, about 40-50 feet high and 20-25 feet in diameter.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
UFO Sighting On Saint Paul's Eastside.;2010-08-10 00:00:00;3 + hours;UFO Sighting On Saint Paul's Eastside. At around 12 am on 08/10/10 my neighbor called me to come view this object hovering in the sky.   My family, a few friends, my neighbors and I then met a few blocks from my house where it appeared as if we were standing directly under the object.   As we stood there many more people, including the local news joined us.  We observed 5 lights in a slightly arched position in the sky with a closer look the lights appeared to be in a straight line.   The lights looked like very close and large circular stars.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886

The event took place around 10:30 pm, I was on the couch watching TV and my son and his friends were outside in the pool.  I heard my son yelling for me to come look at something in the sky.  I looked up and seen a bright orange ball of fire and told my son it must be an asteroid.  He then said look there are 3 more all flying North to South at about (Estimate 10,000 feet up.  Then 5 more came from the same direction then the rest were one after another all pretty much in line with each other.  Not a sound was heard from any of them and they were moving pretty fast. (from above the house until they were out of site about 15 to 20 sec.);44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
Angel shaped UFO.;2015-10-01 03:00:00;15 minutes;Angel shaped UFO. Having had sleeplessness that evening I went out to the balcony of my apartment for a cigarette and scanning the sky I witnessed a  UFO. It at first looked like a star.  It was an Angel shaped object - wings and all. It also had a light blinking at the bottom of both wings.  It had a whitish luminescence to it's shape. I thought perhaps my vision was screwing up so I compared other stars close by - none looked as this did. Watching this for 15 minutes and saw no movement I went back to bed.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
Groupings of round orange lights traveling over Saint Paul, MN.;2015-10-02 20:45:00;all night;Groupings of Round Orange Lights traveling over Saint Paul, MN. Traveling just north of my location moving from east to west a series of round orange lights were seen.  They traveled in groups but not really in formation within the group and as single lights.  I watched them for about 15 minutes before going into the house.  I came outside later (about 2 hours later) and saw one more.  They weren't streaking across the sky but they also weren't traveling slowly either.  They had no noise.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886

Four red lights stacked vertically..no sound.;2016-05-04 21:35:00;5 seconds;Four red lights stacked vertically..no sound 9:35pm  I'm watching tv.  It's a big screen in the corner next to the patio door. The sliding door is open with a southern exposure overlooking the parking lot. Spring-the trees have bloomed.. Something catches my eye. I see four red lights stacked vertically descending at a 45 degree angle - through the trees! It's blood red the lights are well defined. This lasted only 5 seconds.  I lost sight of it behind another apartment complex across the parking lot. I did make a report to the Saint Paul Police.  I was told there were no other reports this evening.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
white dots.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-03-14 21:40:00;3 minutes;white dots so my husband was out having a cigarette and called me out to look at the weird lights above the tree line. bright lights one at a time about 15  seconds apart. they were in a horizontal line. they got to a certain point and just disappeared. They must've been very high as they appeared as really small dots.  so weird. one just drifting across the sky in a straight line followed by another followed by another etc  there were 11 total. it lasted about 3 minutes. I called my daughter and she said spacex was supposed to launch satellites. so I went in and checked and they were supposed to launch in a couple of days this was the 14th . very odd indeed.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
