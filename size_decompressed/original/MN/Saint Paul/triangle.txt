Commercial pilot witnesses triangle craft  in early hours moving silently above treetops.;2004-08-15 05:00:00;25;Triangle Craft Spotted  in early hours moving silently above treetops. I have not spoken to many people about this sighting.   I am a commercial rated pilot.   Short and sweet, I saw a very dark triangle in the Merriam Park area of St, Paul, MN, around August of 2003.  I was picking up my girlfriend to give her a ride to work at about 5 am in a very populated area when I spotted a black triangle in the sky at approx. 500-1000 ft above ground level.  It moved from east to west.  I immediately identified it as a ufo because it had only 3 lights, one at each corner of it's triangle shape. All three lights were white.  The lights were not bright and were pointed down.  I opened my window and heard no noise, just silence.  I tried to follow it, but could not keep up in the city block grid system.  I estimate that it was moving at about 30mph.   I have heard that there has been ongoing activity in this area of the Twin Cities for some years.  Some claim that the river is an attractive spot to these craft.  The nearest airport would depart aircraft in nowhere near this direction and the departing airplanes would have certainly gained thousands of feet of elevation at this distance.

Two triangular craft were seen over a populated area of South Saint Paul, MN, at midnight July 3, to July 4, 2011.;2011-07-04 00:01:00;5 minutes;Two triangular craft were seen over a populated area of South Saint Paul, MN, at midnight July 3, to July 4, 2011. I was watching fireworks at a casino with my date on Sunday July 3, 2001, when she received a phone call that her brother and sister in-law would be stranded at the Greyhound bus station in St. Paul, MN, because their ride hwas unable to come and backed-out.  We agreed to get them at the bus terminal.  They were due in at 00:10 hrs. from Chicago, and although we left Red Wing, MN, a little late, we were sure to get them by 00:20 hrs. While driving northbound on U.S. 52, we approached the city of Saint Paul.  While in the South Saint Paul area, I noticed orange globes above the sodium street lights (also orange) while driving the car.  I looked again, because the orange globes were of a more saturated and slightly darker orange than the street lights.  We both stared out the side windows to see six globes in total.  They were arranged in two groups of three each, forming identical isoceles triangles.  We checked the time and it was 12:00 midnight. I could not make out a fuselage, but my gal saw a non-orange light come out of the center of area of one, then move away.  The two craft hung mothionless, one parallel to the ground and one with the apex tipped downward.  They gave the amusing appearance of two fish in a fishtank, hovering at odd juxtaposition to each other. The craft were roughly estimated to be 100' on the short side and 140' on the long sides and were identical in size. The orange globes were set at the most perpherial points of the craft and were estimated 10' in diameter. They hovered about 200 feet off the ground slightly west of U.S.52 and about 3 miles ESE of the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.  The did not move, they did not make any sound that we could hear, and the fueslage did not become directly visible to us.  Any hull color would have been flat black, or otherwise not visible in the dark of night. We observed the two craft for about 5 minutes before driving out of sight of them.  We met her relatives at the St. Paul Greyhound station at 00:25 on July 4, 2011.  ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above to reflect a sighting on the morning of July 4th, not July 7th, as indicated by the witness.  PD));44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886

triangle with 4 large white lights on leading edge - two smaller red at rear hovering over Roseville in St. Paul;2015-05-17 20:25:00;40 minutes;triangle with 4 large white lights on leading edge - two smaller red at rear hovering over Roseville in St. Paul My sighting took place the evening of 7/17/15  (sic.  05/17/2015) @ 8:25pm.  My sister was driving me home from her house in Brooklyn Center.  I live in Saint Paul, Mn. We were traveling on Hwy 694 East and having just passed the Rice Street Exit, I looked southwest and found lights in the sky that caught my attention.  I've been living in the Twin Cities for 59 years and am aware of the flight paths for TCIAP.  These lights were just north of that corridor. As we continued south on 35E toward down town Saint Paul, I continued to watch this object.  I mentioned to my sister about the object.  It was triangular in shape - but not in a traditional sense. Take one of the equilateral sides and make it longer that the other two.  This was the leading edge, it was convex but not overly so.  Along this edge were four large white lights positioned equally in distance from one another.  The four lights were brighter and larger than any I've seen on an airliner.  The white lights were blinking in unison.  At the tail were two small red lights side by side..these were not blinking. We drove on, and I noticed the white lights stopped blinking..they were on continuously now.  I was now viewing the object from the rear as it was pointed westerly.  I was getting rather excited, my sister was giving me a hard time as my first sighting happened at our family house in North Saint Paul.  I was six years old at that time.   She is well aware of my history of the sightings I've had through out my life.  I am now 61 years of age. She was clearly frustrated as she was driving and couldn't see the object.  Now two miles further down the road my view was obstructed intermittently by trees and homes.  My sister decided to exit the freeway, in hopes that she may  see it as well and perhaps find a spot unencumbered by obstacles.  We proceeded toward my home and both agreed that Mounds Park--overlooking the Mississippi River--might be the place to pause for a look. I had - on the way to the park - caught a glimpse of the object.  It should have been further to the north-west but through the broken clouds it had seemed to be closer to us now.  It slid into the low overcast and disappeared.  Despite our stopping at the park and spending some time watching we were not to see it again. At the park, we were able to observe that flight corridor and a number of aircraft to Twin Cites International Airport..which allowed me to better judge the size of the object.  I would estimate the width of the object  to be 300 feet.  I went to the internet and estimated the dimensions of the 727 aircraft I am used to seeing in this area. Conditions during encounter:  after dark, cloudy with a low to higher ceiling having had rain through out the day. Time estimated during sighting:  15-20 minutes. I did talk with the Saint Paul Police to see if any other reports were made.  None reported at that time.  That call was made ~9:30pm. I do state that all the above is true.  ..

TR3B craft (Blk w/ white lights underneath, triangle), hovering low & slow, I lost it but it may have shapeshifted into an airplane.;2015-05-18 00:00:00;5-10 minutes;TR3B craft (Blk w/ white lights underneath, triangle), hovering low & slow, I lost it but it may have shapeshifted into an airplane. I was coming home from work & on my left above the golf course, I could see 3-4 white lights.  When I looked closer, I could see they were attached to a black Stealth Bomber looking craft, that was silent.  It was low & slow.   It started to fly in toward the golf course, so I drove around to try & follow, but lost it.   I parked near the course hoping to see it again, & an airplane about the same size & silent, but completely different looking then the craft I saw flew out from the golf course & flew in a direction I couldn't follow, it seemed to have shape shifted.
