lighted disk with smaller brighter center light;2007-08-17 22:00:00;1 minute;lighted disk with smaller brighter center light My mother and I were in a parking lot after a minor league baseball game this evening Of 08/17  and we both saw this disk at the same time.  It was very close.  It was silver-ish in color and had a brighter smaller center light.  It hovered and moved about â€“ nothing like anything we have ever seen.  It did this for about a minute and then slowly moved off in a straight line.  It was very cloudy that night so I knew it was flying low for us to be able to see it.   We think it may have been attracted by the big baseball field lighting.  My mother is 78 and I am the 9th of her 14 children and I am 46.  We are white, middleclass.  She is a homemaker and I am a computer analyst.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
