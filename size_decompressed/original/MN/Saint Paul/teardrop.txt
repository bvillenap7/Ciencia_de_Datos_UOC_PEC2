Strange object in Metro sky;2004-08-19 16:30:00;Several Hours;Strange object in Metro sky This is a report of the same UFO sighted in the Twin Cities area on this date- thousands of people saw this- it went right over the metro.  I left work in downtown St Paul around 4:30 in the afternoon.  As I walked down the street I saw several people pointing up.  As this is an odd occurance in the middle of the city, I felt compelled to look up.  My experience is about the same as the others who reported.  It was a white or metallic reflective object, circle or somewhat teardroped in shape.  I don't believe it had lights of it's own, it just looked like reflected sunlight.  It did not appear to be moving and was very high.  It was quite small to the naked eye.  Others have mentioned, and I agree, a pea held at arms length would have covered the object.  Where and when I viewed it, it was very near overhead.  Perhaps a handswidth or two from directly overhead.  Reports of the object spanned the Twin Cities metro- sighting of this object was also reported on 8/19 and 8/20 in Wisconsin.  It was a rather obvious sight since the sky was crystal blue with no (few) clouds.  I did not spend more than a few minutes watching this object.  I did see reports on the news that said it had been around for hours.  I'm very interested to get an explaination.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
