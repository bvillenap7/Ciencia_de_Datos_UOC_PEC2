So me my mother and my brother went outside on the porch to see whats going on and my brother said LOOK. There was a search light in the sky but it wasn't straight up in the sky, it was at a low angle and in the light i saw an image floating through it.  There was no sound, no cars, no nothing all was quiet. Then the search light moved off the object and i saw a huge UFO. it was flying as low as a plane would fly (1000 ft. not sure).  The ship was humungus. It floated aroung the house and i bent over the porch rail to see it and then i looked at my mom then i looked back and it was gone.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
((HOAX))  Was searching for evidence of Bigfoot sighting in St Paul, Minnesota, experienced possible abduction.;2016-03-12 14:30:00;1;Was searching for evidence of Bigfoot sighting in St Paul, Minnesota, experienced possible abduction. I was out looking for Bigfoot, in the hills around St Paul, Minnesota, over the weekend, after enjoying a nice meal at McDonald's.  I was separated from my group of expeditionists, and I saw a bright light that seemed to move in a zig-zag pattern.  I was confused at first, but thought nothing of it, until it seemed to get larger, and closer.  I realized it was actually a metal craft that was shaped like the a chevron, kind of like what you see on a gas station sign for a chevron location.   I felt frozen in place as the bright lights got closer to me, and I couldn't move.  I felt a strange warmth engulf me, and then I was in a strange place, it metal.  I wasn't alone, I couldn't make them out, there was a strange haze in the air, and a buzzing in my ears.  The entities or what have you got close to me but I still couldn't see them, my vision got blurry. Then suddenly I was back on the trail, and my companions found me, near the Mississippi River bluffs, saying that I'd disappeared for about 35 minutes.  Please help. ((NUFORC Note:  Hoax.
