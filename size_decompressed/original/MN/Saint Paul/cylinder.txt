An iridescent orange, cylinder shaped object spotted in St. Paul, MN;2012-06-01 22:05:00;1-2 minutes;An iridescent orange, cylinder shaped object spotted in St. Paul, MN On June 1, 2012 at approximately 10:05pm I was traveling on Cheuneman Street.  I stopped at a stop sign at the intersection of Cheuneman Street and Hoffman Street.  I looked up into the sky and noticed something bright. The width was the size of a large school bus and the length was twice the size of that.  It was a cylinder shaped object with a bright iridescent orange color.  It was similar to the color of the orange hand that instructs pedestrians to stop at a crosswalk.  There appeared to be no windows or anything attached to this object.  There were flames coming from the bottom of this object blowing towards the SE direction the same length as the object, but it did not make any noise.  It was approximately six or seven stories high from the ground.  It remained in an upright position and sat in this location for ten seconds before traveling upward towards the East somewhat slowly, about the speed of an airplane in the sky.  I watched the orange colored ob! ject travel behind a cloud until it appeared to be grape in size and soon after disappeared.  I called the national weather service and I was informed that the wind was blowing 2 miles per hour in the SE direction on that day.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
