Chrome ball over the cliffs of St. Paul;1997-07-04 16:00:00;35 seconds;Chrome ball over the cliffs of St. Paul I was watching a band playing at the Taste of Minnesota at the State Capitol.  I like to watch people, so I started watching the crowd.   I noticed what I thought was a water tower or the top of a very tall parking lot light sitting over the cliffs to the east.  The cliffs were about 2-3 miles away.   The object sat just above the horizon of the cliffs.  It looked like it was made of shiny metal, like chrome. As I said, I thought it was a water tower or light, but I couldn't see any support pole of any kind.  It was a bright, clear, and sunny day.  I continued to stare at the object waiting for my eyes to resolve the support pole.  After about 35-40 seconds, I looked back at the band (I was tired of looking at what I thought was a water tower).   After about 5 more seconds, I looked back at the cliffs, but it was gone.  I never shifted my feet and the area of the sky I could see was very small (about 5 degrees side to side, and about 2 degrees top to bottom) because of the trees framing the top.  I had to be looking at the same area of the sky.  I moved my upper body back and forth, and up and down to find the object again, but it was not there.  I walked around to the other side of crowd so I could see more of the sky, but could not find a water tower or light.  The object had simply disapeared.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
11 balls of solid light formed a circle around the horizon,  sat still for a while then quickly darted around and disappeared.;2004-10-15 23:00:00;10min;11 balls of solid light formed a circle around the horizon,  sat still for a while then quickly darted around and disappeared. I was driving down highway 36 when all of a sudden 10 spheres of bright white lights appeared in the sky around my vehicle.  They were in a perfect circle around thew horizon and were quite low in the sky. My best judgment tells me they were agligned aroung a 10 to 15 mile circumfrence.  I then looked through my moonroof and there was one directly above me.  It appeared to follow along right above my car as I drove down the hwy.  The 10 in teh circle then began to quickly dart about and then began to all quickly move outwards and then disappeared over the horizon.  I looked up at the one above me and it moved straight up into the air slowly and eventually disappeared into the clouds above. The spheres themselves were perfect in shape and did not blink of flash or pulsate.  Their light was solid and very bright.  They stayed perfectly still while they were at rest and darted around around like no plane or helicopter I have ever seen.  I rolled down my window to listen for the sound of a helicopter or plane, but there was only silence.  My wife is witness to this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Orange fireball looking UFO.;2012-12-31 21:45:00;5 minutes;orange fireball looking UFO I was listening to Coast to Coast AM and was listening to all the sightings of blue streaks of light and also orange fireballs seen in the sky that also looked like UFO's.  I saw an orange fireball that reminded me of a hot air balloon but with no balloon.  It was very small, but still noticeable.  I was driving home from work on New Year's Eve and saw this on Highway 94 West.  I kept staring at it saying what is it?  I was thinking, it has to be a UFO.  Then, I heard tonight on Coast to Coast AM that other people have been seeing the same thing and that confirmed my sighting.  I can't believe the government is keeping quiet about UFO's.  We all know they exist.  I am glad I was listening to the show and that is what prompted me to write in.  I have also seen a blue light streak across the sky as I was driving in Kansas about a couple of years ago.  I heard more people are seeing blue light UFO's that look like a streak of light.  I didn't say anything to an! yone and thought I may have been a little crazy.  The more I thought about it I was like maybe it is a UFO.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886

Four objects fly in seeming formation and make unusual turns. Almost hugging each other for a moment.;2013-10-27 19:59:00;1 minute;Four objects fly in seeming formation and make unusual turns. Almost hugging each other for a moment. 4 well defined spots traveling west to east, south of 2 adults and a child, near university ave and rice street in St. Paul, mn 55103. Could have been a meteor or other object breaking up, but the four or five objects seem to be monuvering on their own.  We watched as they faded from view, towards the city of Woodbury, Washington county.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
White hovering sphere with red and yellow lights in its center;2020-04-18 23:49:00;20 minutes;White hovering sphere with red and yellow lights in its center Heading to bed at 23:40 and glanced outside the window and noticed a very bright object in the western sky.  I thought it was a planet or a light but upon closer inspection, I noticed that there was movement - hovering sideways. I asked my wife to come to the window to get her take. The first words out of her mouth were, “Holy heck! What on earth is that?!” We both noted that it was moving/shimmering side to side. Unfortunately, I left my glasses downstairs but even so when I stared closer, I could see that red and bright yellow lights were swirling around the object's center. My wife had her glasses on and, again, corroborated my description. It hovered for about 15 minutes and then dropped slowly downward. Unfortunately, a large tree obscured most of the detail, so we didn’t see where it went. The object appeared to be far away, so it was difficult to determine size.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
