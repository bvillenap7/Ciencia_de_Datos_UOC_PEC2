HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  My wife noticed the flying V formation heading due south;2004-04-01 20:30:00;three minutes;The witness for the sighting below are referring to the sighting report which took place on March 31, 2004 and the witnesses to that case had taken a number of photos of what they saw. Also a link to the March 31, 2004 sighting is included in this new report below.  My wife and I saw the exact same thing over downtown St Paul last night heading south around 8:30 PM.  We believe it was a flock of geese flying at a high elevation that were catching the last rays of sunlight.  Additional Information Below:  We live in a high rise in downtown St Paul, Minnesota, so I believe we have a different vantage point from which to view the phenomena than someone on the ground would have.  At approximately 8:30 PM on Thursday we went out on our balcony to have a cigarette.  The sun had set and it was fairly dark.  My wife noticed the flying V formation heading due south.  The sight was identical to the picture you posted on Rense.com. or here at: http://www.hbccufo.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1150  She pointed it out to me and we stared at it.  Our initial thought was that it was a UFO.  But as we observed for about three minutes we noticed that the formation metamorphised into a sloppy looking W.  Then we saw a piece of it break off and go to the other side forming a lopsided V formation again. There was a cloud formation to the southeast that was slightly illuminated on the top as well.  Both the formation and the cloud to the southeast faded out simultaneously.  There is a large Canadian goose population around here.  Typically we can see flocks flying south near the end of the evening.  Based on our observation we thought that the V was a flock of geese flying at a higher than normal elevation and they were catching the last rays of light on their underbellies.  Again, we could be wrong.  I have seen unexplained sights in the sky before but this was the first time I had ever seen an illuminated flying V.  In this particular instance though, I think that the sight we saw probably had a natural explanation.  It may very well be that what you observed portrayed different characteristics and was not the same phenomenon we observed.  I wish you luck in solving the mystery.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
three craft travel in formation above Minnesota.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible contrail, we believe.  PD));2004-08-15 23:12:00;7minutes;three craft travel in formation above Minnesota six of us were lying on the ground in a thinly wooded park after dark watching the sky. One of us saw a moving object in the sky and pointed it out. I thought it was a human-made satelite at first, however as we watched two other objects aproached it in a triangular formation. The objects appeared as white lights, about the size that an average star would appear. The three craft traveled slowly accross the sky for several minutes, then quickly sped up and traveled outside of the area that we could see. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have looked at the photographs provided, and our impression is that the pinkish object is the contrail behind a high-altitude jet.  The sky is still light in the photo, and the object is to the west of the witnesses.  PD));44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886

4 flashing lights moving in a formation over St. Paul, MN.;2009-09-06 21:15:00;5 minutes;4 flashing lights moving in a formation over St. Paul, MN. 4 flashing lights in formation, sometimes in a straight line, sometimes stacked diagonally over each other.  At times hovering, then moving erratically up and down.   We first thought it was an aircraft pulling the others until we saw them jump in a V like fashion in unison with one another.

3 round red lights moving in formation (line) from the West to the East.;2010-07-04 22:02:00;4 minutes;3 round red lights moving in formation (line) from the West to the East. While waiting for fireworks to begin, I noticed 3 red lights at a high altitude moving from the West to East.  I observed the objects with red lights moving in a straight line formation.  There were no flashing lights on the objects to identify them as aircraft.  The objects appeared to be round in shape.  I could not hear any sounds coming from the direction of the objects.  The objects were moving at the speed of a jet aircraft.   As the objects were moving towards the West, the first object climbed at a rapid rate of speed until out of sight.   The other two objects continued moving west until fading out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

String of lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of cluster of Space Link satellites.  PD)) ((anonymous source));2019-05-25 00:05:00;1 minute;String of lights I saw approximately 100 lights in a straight line with several lights following, moving slowly across the sky. I witnessed this from my back porch at approximately five minutes after Midnight  They were in a perfect line and spaced very closely together but there was a small separation between each light, almost like a string of Christmas tree white lights pulled tight moving all together at the same speed.  I would approximate the height to be 10 thousand feet. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of cluster of Space Link satellites??

We then looked south towards the moon and observed approximately 50 to 60 lighted objects flying in a row, from the direction of the moon towards the NE. They were all moving at approximately the speed and had similar spacing, but not completely equally spaced.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
