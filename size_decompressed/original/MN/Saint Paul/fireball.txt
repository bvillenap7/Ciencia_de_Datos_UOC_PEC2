An orange shooting star in the SSE area of the sky.;1997-11-28 00:45:00;5 secs., max;Summary : An orange shooting star in the SSE area of the sky. This object was very orange. I'd never seen an object this orange, and it fizzled, throwing off sparks as it fell. It ended with a visual poof.  It was like a pop-bottle rocket in reverse. I saw this driving home from work. I can easily believe it was just a piece of meteor or space junk that got unusually close to the earth to flame and spark so much. Most other shooting stars I've seen have been white and made a thin white line as they've streaked across the sky. This seemed to have a more downward motion to the earth. I wouldn't report it other than the fact that I heard Peter's report on the Art Bell show, and was wondering if the sighting in Chicago occurred at this time. I didn't catch the day or time of the sighting. If this seems to fit the description of a regular falling star, then I apologize for having taken your time. It's just that I'd never seen a shooting star this orange. Thanks. BTW, I work as a copy editor at a daily newspaper here in the Twin Cities and am skeptical-to-open about UFOs, etc.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
A light/fireball passing overhead in Saint Paul, MN;2011-12-17 22:00:00;5 minutes;A light/fireball passing overhead in Saint Paul, MN I was heading to my car when I glanced up at the sky and saw an orange light/fireball. I first dismissed it as an airplane since I live with a few miles of an international airport but it kept flying closer and closer.  Eventually, after a minute or two, it headed right over my head and was heading from the northwest to the southeast. As it was passing over my head, there was no noise coming from the light/fireball and after a few minutes, the fireball passed out of sight.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886

Fireball over Como Lake,  St Paul , MN. No sound !;2012-06-09 22:30:00;2 Minutes;Fireball over Como Lake ! St Paul , Mn. No sound ! I stopped my bike at the N.E. corner of Como Lake in St Paul , MN.  I looked up to see an orange light approaching from the south.  I thought plane maybe but I heard no sound, so a helicopter with spotlight but there was no light beam.  It flew over the lake and right over my head, maybe 200 hundred feet up. It seemed to be flame on the bottom of something,  I could only make out one small black dot on one side of this object.   A jogger who was passing by said, what is that thing?   After it passed over very slowly it left to the north at great speed, less than a second to be out of sight! This all lasted maybe two minutes.  A young man maybe 17 or 18 y.o. asked me if I had seen this object and he was very happy when I told him I had .;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
