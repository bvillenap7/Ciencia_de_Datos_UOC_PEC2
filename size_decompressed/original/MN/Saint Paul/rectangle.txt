One of those orange fireballs, but rectangular in shape.;2012-07-21 00:40:00;20 seconds;One of those orange fireballs, but rectangular in shape. Experienced night sky watcher, who has never seen a UFO before, but tracks planets and constellations and has watched the northern lights and tracked satellites moving across the sky many times.  Tonight I saw one of those orange fireballs, but rectangular in shape, like a burning sheet of paper flying quickly and silently across the sky. It passed over Como Lake in St. Paul from south to north at an altitude one would usually associate with helicopters (a few hundred feel up).  According to the weather service the air was calm.  The fireball passed over the sky and disappeared over the trees to the north in about 20 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Rectangular patch of bright orange light containing flames moving silently across the sky.;2012-07-21 00:40:00;15-20 seconds;Rectangular patch of bright orange light containing flames moving silently across the sky. I saw a bright orange roughly rectangular shaped object coming towards me and passing over in the sky from south to north at about 12:40 am, July 21, 2012.  This was something I have never seen before and could not identify, however, it looked very much like the description of an object reported to this site on June 9, 2012, which that reporter described as a bright rectangular orange light flying silently over Como Park. I was walking along the east side of Lake Como in the Como park neighborhood of St. Paul when I saw the object approaching in the sky from the south.  The object seemed to pass right over the lake south to north, not as high as an airplane would be (maybe a few hundred feet high?).  At first I thought it must be a helicopter approaching, but then I did not hear any sound (it was completely silent) and I could not discern the body or outlines of any physical object, just a patch of bright orange light with what looked like flames near the bottom.  When I saw the flames I thought that it must be a hot air balloon traveling at night.  However, as I watched it I realized that it was traveling much too fast to be a balloon. It was a still night (no breeze) and the light traveled across the sky and out of view over the trees in about 15-20 seconds.  The rectangular patch of light was a very bright orange and seemed to partly composed of yellow-orange flames.

Rectangle object with lights moving across sky;2012-09-28 19:14:00;17 seconds;Rectangle object with lights moving across sky I'm a professional photographer and on Sept 28th while photographing an evening shot of a hotel in St Paul, MN, I captured and odd looking object.  It was two parallel lines moving across the sky with 3 lights on the edge of the upper line.  I think that if this was an aircraft it would be blurred but this images is very sharp with no blurring.  It was a clear evening and there was no air traffic in the sky.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
One larger object, w/ 4 smaller obj.s hovering nearby.  The 4 smaller units disappeared up into clouds.;2015-07-25 20:15:00;30 minutes;One larger object with four smaller objects hovering nearby.  The four smaller units disappeared up into clouds, then shortly after the large one was lost in clouds too.   The larger object appeared to stay stationary while the four smaller objects appeared to move about.  No lights were seen, but it was still light outside.

Two rectangular prism crafts sighted in Saint Paul, MN;2018-01-18 18:00:00;30 seconds;Two rectangular prism crafts sighted in Saint Paul, MN My wife and I were driving through Saint Paul, heading west on highway 36.  As we were crossing the Rice Street exit, we saw 2 black rectangular prism shapes in the sky to the south.  There are a few airports  in the area, so planes are constantly flying overhead.  We both asked out loud, What is that?   As we looked closer, we noticed the crafts were extremely low - I'm guessing less than 1,000 feet.  They were larger than a plane (I'd estimate twice as big in each dimension - length, height, width).   The crafts, originally appearing to move southeast, turned counter clockwise and headed northwest.  They moved slowly.  By this time, the two crafts were moving directly over our vehicle.  It was evening, so the sky was darker.   I tried looking for dark shapes extending off the objects to indicate wings I might have just assumed it was a plane had I seen them, but there was only the rectangular prism shape.  One craft flew with its body oriented diagonally, while the other was straight length-wise.   Both objects had a short line of lights  on the bottom.  I vaguely recall a few white lights and a blue light:  A line of 2-3 white lights, then a blue light, followed by another white light.  The lights did not blink.   As they flew over us, they separated.  One flew more north and the other headed northwest.  I pulled off the Lexington exit and stopped in a parking lot to take another look in their direction, but they were no longer in sight.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886

Detailed sighting of a black rectangular craft with circles on the bottom.  Seen traveling then vanished!;2019-10-31 18:00:00;15 seconds;Detailed sighting of a black rectangular craft with circles on the bottom.  Seen traveling then vanished! As a lifelong lover of space, weather, aviation craft etc.  from a young age I have always found myself staring up to the sky.  I mean compulsively.  Whenever I step outside, I always check the full skyline for sun, moon, stars, storms, aircraft ...anything.  Also as an Engineer I’ve always believed that advanced technologies do or have existed. Despite all this and in 40 years of living I’ve never seen anything unexplainable in the skies.  This changed on Oct 31st 2019.  I prepped the kids for Trick or Treating then went outside on our north facing deck of my home in the middle of a populated area.  Immediately I noticed a black object sitting in the sky maybe a mile or two to the north.  At the same time I heard the sound of a small prop plane, and at first I thought this propeller sound was coming from the black object and that the black  object was just a typical aircraft.  But I then noticed a small, much closer, very slow flying Cessna traveling west to east above I-94 that was clearly making the sound I heard.  It was just getting to dusk as I remember the Cessna’s flashing lights were on and I could just still see its paint color.  I refocused back on the black object and my heart started to race a bit as it looked unusual and rectangular.  Seconds later it started flying towards me, but at 45 degree angle from straight at me.  I now could clearly see it was indeed a black colored rectangle (geometric prism) or aka brick shape.  It moved with the wider dimension out to its sides (not lengthwise).  The object then moved by jumping(?) forward and started now to the ESE direction, I rubbed my eyes   as I could not believe it and also it seemed it could blur out of focus.  Overall, I got some very clear looks at this object and it was an definitely an engineered flying craft unlike anything I’ve ever seen! There were two larger white circles at each end and about 4 smaller white circles all in-line with the larger two circles across the width of the rectangle.  There were no flashing lights and these larger circles weren’t lights it appeared, but looked maybe half spheres recessed into the craft like ceiling can lights or something...I don’t know.  They were white, but very soft and hazy, not bright at all.  The object was really messing with my mind and senses.  It had: zero sound, moved supernaturally smooth (it appeared it could also sort of jump forward in space, unlike typically high speed acceleration) , extremely poor aerodynamics (like a wide brick like geometry),  came in and out of focus (optical cloaking?),  and not sure if I was panicking but I felt like it saw me watching it. Finally, it flew fast well out in front of the Cessna in the sky and as soon as I reached for my phone it completely disappeared!  This all lasted I think about 15 seconds.  I’ve been obsessed since then and have read extensively through the NUFORC archives of rectangular craft.  I also have performed google image searches and have found some very similar pictures and descriptions.  Ive created a detailed drawing using MSPowerpoint  It was certainly larger than the Cessna, and was pretty dang big, but not humongous- maybe 180ft width or “wingspan” if you will.  Also, due to its direction change from the N to ESE I also saw its depth and height (side profile) very well and it was much smaller maybe 20ft depth x15 ft high,  hard to say for sure.   So, clearly, dimensionally it strangely was just a 3D rectangle - no protruding tail, wings or features other than the circles on the bottom.  I strongly believe the Cessna could’ve easily seen this object as it was maybe just several hundred feet higher in elevation and zoomed out ahead of the Cessna or just to the pilot’s front-left.  This was no toy drone and should not have been able to move like this.  My belief is the two larger, white, half-spheres have something significant to do with its power/propulsion as when its direction changed one of these circles haziness was more prominent  I’ve replayed this sighting over and over in my head and I’m confident in all these descriptions of what I saw.  I would have submitted my story sooner, but wanted to do my research and was unsure what I should do.;44.9343300739524;-93.1075406737886
