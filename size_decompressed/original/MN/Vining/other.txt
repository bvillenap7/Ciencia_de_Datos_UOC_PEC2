I was about 12 years old riding a minibike on a gravel road when an object caught my eye moving in the sky. This is a rural area, so there are not too many aircraft to be seen. The object I saw was a tapered curved cylindrical object with a sphere on the narrow end. The object appeared to be metallic. I immediately stopped the minike and shut off the engine to observe the craft move to the west in a slow but steady manner and without making a sound. The distance and size of the object were hard to determine, but I'd guess it was at 3 to 5 thousand feet and approximately 50 feet long. I immediately rushed home approx a quarter mile and tried to locate the object with a telescope but it already disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));46.2221;-95.5093
A  large V shaped object in the night sky.;2003-08-30 23:15:00;I Seen a V shaped object ;A  large V shaped object in the night sky. I SEEN A v shaped object in the south eastern sky.  It was 11:15 pm.  It was very large. About the size of a football field or larger. It was moving very slowly.  It made no sound.  It had three red lights on one side and two on the other. It had a cluster of white lights in the nose. With my binoculars I could tell that the cluster  was three white lights.  These three white lights toghter were about the same size as one red light.  These lights were not flashing like plane lights do. The one red light that was missing was bettween the two red lights on one side.  It glided off to the east, till I couldn't see it any more.  I seen it for about 3 minutes.  All the lights moved together as if it was one huge object.;46.2221;-95.5093
