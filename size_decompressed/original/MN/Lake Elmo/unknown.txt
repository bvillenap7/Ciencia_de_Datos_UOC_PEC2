We went outside for a smoke break on a cloudy and drizziling night. We soon noticed up in the sky a moderately bright red light which lit up the haze around it. It was intense enough to light the street up as well due to the water on the roadway. it had the exact same appearance in intensity and height as a radio or water tower mounted with a red light would on such a hazy night. However I know the area well. There is no such tower in the area, just a farm field, so this light which made no noise is unexplainable. after 3-4 min it began to fluctuate and dim until it disappeared as mysteriously as it had appeared.
