Hovering craft with bright light over Lake elmo;2020-02-23 20:00:00;1 minute;Hovering craft with bright light over Lake elmo At dusk, a friend and I noticed an unnaturally bright looking over Lake Elmo.  It was a light amber in color.  It was silently hovering in place for about 30 seconds.  Then the bright light went out, and multiple dim ones appeared.  The outline of the craft could now be seen, and it was fairly large, given the distance it was from us. The craft then zipped silently across until out of sight. There is no possibility it was a plane or helicopter.;44.9935;-92.9035
