It looked like a planet - but moved;2005-07-13 01:00:00;10 min;It looked like a planet - but moved I noticed what looked like a yellowish orange planet just over the east horizon, but the planet/object was twinkling, which appeared uncharacteristic of a planet.  Opon closer evaluation while standing outside, I noticed the object would slowly drift to the side and downward,and then upward again.  The object did not necessarily return to its original position or appear to be moving away.  I would have to say the object was several miles away, but I really could not determine it's actual distance.
