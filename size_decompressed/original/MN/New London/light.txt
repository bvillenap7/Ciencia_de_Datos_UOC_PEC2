Bright white light turned to red as it sped up, slowed down, and zigzagged across the sky.;2008-07-30 22:43:00;1 minute or so;Bright white light turned to red as it sped up, slowed down, and zigzagged across the sky. I was out looking at the stars facing to the east off of my deck.  Off to the north but almost directly up in the center of the sky a very bright white light appeared out of nowhere.  It appeared to be flying at the same height that the airplanes fly but it did not fly like a plane.  I watched it for a few seconds and witnessed it speeding up and slowing down while making a slight zigzag pattern along the path of flight.  I called my fianc√© out to see it after about 15 seconds or so.  He came out and we watched it fly farther to the east continuing in the same pattern previously described.  After about 30 seconds the object began to change from bright white to bright red and then disappeared in the eastern sky. After it turned red we only saw it for about 15 more seconds.;45.2975;-94.9435
