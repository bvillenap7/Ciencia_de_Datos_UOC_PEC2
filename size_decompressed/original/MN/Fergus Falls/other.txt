V-shaped pattern of faint reddish lights;2001-11-18 04:20:00;2-3 minutes;V-shaped pattern of faint reddish lights My two children and I had gone outside around 4 am to watch the meteor shower, and I would say it was about 20 minutes later that my 7 year old son pointed out a V-shaped pattern of faint reddish lights overhead, moving at about the speed one would expect to see a plane flying.  While I believe I did hear what sounded like a plane engine very distantly, we are also near an Interstate highway, and the tractor-trailer engines have fooled me before, sounding very much like jet engines or small planes as they accelerate, and there was moderate freeway traffic at this time. At any rate, this pattern of lights seemed to be flying quite high, and unlike plane lights, these lights did not flicker or blink, but remained constant.  I watched this pattern for about 2-3 minutes while it made frequent direction changes, very tight, smooth turns and I eventually lost track of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date should be November 18.
