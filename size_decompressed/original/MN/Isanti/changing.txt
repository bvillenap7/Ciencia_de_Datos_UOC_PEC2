Bright light in the sky changed shape or direction then disappeared.;2007-03-10 16:40:00;6 seconds;Bright light in the sky changed shape or direction then disappeared. Me and my girlfriend were going east on 95 from Cambridge, Mn. Going to North Branch for some Taco Bell. About half way to North Branch, I looked up and noticed this bright light in the sky. It was about 4:40pm so it was still light out and I was in the passenger seat. I said look what is that! We both saw it I watched it the whole time while my girlfriend was driving. It looked like it turned from going west to south it looked very bright and saucer like. I looked like it turned vertical or changed shape and disappeared. I don’t know if this is related or what it was but last night same day I got off work late about 12pm I had been working all day. When I got home we played a few games then wound down to eat a late snack and we both heard a knocking on our living room window freaked us out I went out side with a tire iron and flash light and looked around the house nothing.  The yard light was flashing off and on which I’ve never seen it do (Its one of those motion sensors with two flood lights). It felt like a strong presence was there I got a bad headache and felt very uneasy like something was going to happen, What happened last night was even stranger and way scarier than the saucer like light we saw. I hope you don’t think were crazy, I would take a lie detector test on this if I had to.;45.4682;-93.2266
