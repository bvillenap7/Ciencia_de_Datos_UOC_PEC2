2 Strange lights in a line formation.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 21:00:00;5 Minutes;2 Strange lights in a line formation I saw 2 lights in the sky that did not look like airplanes or a helecopter. They were flying in a straight line and keeping the exact distance between them the whole time.   The lead craft was a very dim light and the second following light was very bright.  When I first saw it I thought it was Venus but then I noticed it was following a dimmer light.  I watched as they flew north then gradually changed direction and started west to North Branch.   The unusual part was the lack of blinking lights and It was bright as it was going away from me. Generally the planes I see go dark as they go away from me. They were silent which also seemed unusual to me. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));45.4682;-93.2266
