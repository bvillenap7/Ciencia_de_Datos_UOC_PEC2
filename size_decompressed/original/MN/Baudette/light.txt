Four lights moving together in formation.;2015-04-15 01:00:00;5 seconds;Four lights moving together in formation. I saw 4 lights the same size as a star, but these (I saw four) lights were moving to the east in formation.  If you connected the dots/lights, they would make a trapezoid shape.   They all moved at the same constant speed, which was much faster than an airplane, but slower than a meteor/shooting star.  They were approx 75 degrees above the horizon line & I was looking due north when I saw them.  All 4 lights moved in a straight line, headed east, and stayed equal distance from each other as they moved east.  They only stayed visible for approx 5 seconds.;48.6914;-94.5939
