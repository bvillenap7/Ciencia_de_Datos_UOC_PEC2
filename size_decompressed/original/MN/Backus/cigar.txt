My twin daughters were playing on our trampoline.  One of them ran inside and said, Dad, there is something in the sky and its not an airplane. I went outside looked to the sky and saw a large brilliant white cigar shaped craft moving across the sky from north to south.   A few seconds later my wife came out and witnessed it also.  Lasted about a minute before it moved to far away to see.   The object was about as high in the air as a plane.   No noise.  No trail behind it. I have a picture that was very zoomed in.  Haven't been able to download it to a computer to veiw it yet.  On my camera it looks to be blurry.;46.8708;-94.3924
