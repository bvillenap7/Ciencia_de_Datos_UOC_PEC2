At around 20:00 CST, five witnesses at our location observed four single, pointed, very bright, orange-yellow lights spaced roughly 15 minutes apart and tracking NE from the SW horizon at a speed estimated to be at least that which would require jet propulsion.   There were no strobes or other lights that could obviously associate this light with normal aviation operations.   At the same time there was an intense storm moving in from the west that was displaying an incredible amount of mid-air and ground strike lightning and was creating near daylight conditions.   As the source of light traveled, it made no sound and none was observed after it passed 90 degrees tangentially.   There were periods when there was no thunder or wind and any engine noise should have been audible.  The sky was clear above as we watched the front move in.   The light, after roughly 100 seconds of travel, entered the clouds near the more intense lightning and disappeared.   While moving between us and the clouds, there were flashes of lightning in the clouds that should have silhouetted any structure carrying the light and none was observed.   The observers included 4 adults, two with some aviation background and one child.;46.3233;-95.8387
