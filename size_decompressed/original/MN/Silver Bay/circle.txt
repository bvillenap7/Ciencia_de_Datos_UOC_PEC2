Strange orange lights over Lake Superior.;2015-10-15 21:00:00;5 minutes;Strange orange lights over Lake Superior. While camping I saw four strange orange lights before going in our camper.  I stopped to get a better view and noticed another set of four orange lights to the left.  All of them are in line horizontal to the ground.  As far as I could tell they were over Lake Superior.  About 45 degrees from where I was standing.   I was going to dismiss as jet flares however, the far left light of the four I was watching moved extremely fast to the left. Then shot back into position.  As soon as I called for my wife they moved into a square like formation and disappeared.  While explaining to her what I saw, three lights in a triangle position appeared as disappeared.  No sounds.;47.3599;-91.216
