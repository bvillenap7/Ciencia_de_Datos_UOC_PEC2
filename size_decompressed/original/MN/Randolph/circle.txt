circular, lime-green object with a tracer lime-green tail;2006-08-01 22:50:00;15 sec;circular, lime-green object with a tracer lime-green tail I was driving Hwy. 56 (so.), 3/4 of a before the Cty Rd. 19 turn towards Cannon Falls, at approximately 10:30PM. My peripheral vision caught site(left side) of a 'lime green' (10x's plus the size of a shooting star). At first, I thought it to be a shooting star - I realized it wasn't a shooting star, when I actually stared at it. It shot from left to right - moving speed similar to speed of shooting star, if not faster. It was circular - lime green with a lime green (tracer) tail that was the length of - if you look directly straight forward to when your peripheral vision took place.  I watched it go towards my right and diappeared behind a black rain cloud. (there was distant light from lightening where I saw the black (dark) cloud). The angle - object flew like a shooting star, but, was descending like a falling star - then vanished. When I saw this, my heart started jumping - made me excited to see such a site.  I mentioned this to my friends that night - most sad I'm crazy or I made this up and one did say that it could of been an asterroid. I only wish my camera was available, and if it was, I wasn't fast enough to get the photo.  It was amazing! Please get back at me regarding this issue. I would like to know if this WAS a UFO. And if this moment was a moment to remember, I'd like to smile about it.  Thank You for time! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));44.5238;-93.0222
