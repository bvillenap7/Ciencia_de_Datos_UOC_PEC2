Star-like spheres for past few weeks consistant every night.;2011-08-29 20:00:00;5 minutes;Star-like spheres for past few weeks consistant every night. For the past 3 weeks between the hours of 8:30 pm to 10:30, we have been witnessing an object which is very bright and within our atmosphere appears star like or sun like with a round white bright center and rays protruding from it. It makes no noise at all and travels not as fast as a satellite much higher in the sky.  They have been moving West to East and you can view them for about 5 minutes when they start losing their brightness and then gently disappear from view.  We had watched 2 in one night, one moving West to East and then another moving North to South within a half an hour apart.  They've been consistent every night though the time of their arrival changes.;47.4898;-92.4052
