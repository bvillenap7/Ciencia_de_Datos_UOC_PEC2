This is I beleive the forth instance that I myself have seen this same object my girlfriend has seen on two occasions. Some nights it appears to be much slower and more erratic in its trajectory although it has not been low enough to get a close look it is fairly obvious that it is not a airplane/jet for there is no sound at all and the manuvaers are so erratic that any normal aircraft pilot would have lost his flight privlages. I am a business owner and my girlfriend is college student ((NUFORC NOTE:  Time of sighting is ambiguous in original report.  May be 1445 hrs..));47.4898;-92.4052
