I was outside tonight 4/19/2020 at 11:15PM trying to spot meteors from the meteor shower that's supposed to be happening. I didnt see any. But what I did see was a very dim whitish orange triangle shape (3) lights. Go across the sky very fast. I couldn't tell if it was 100 feet high in the sky. Or on space. But it was moving very fast. Faster then a plane. I am in a sober house. So I know what I saw was real.it was about the size of a quarter if you held it out as far as your arms extend. It made no sound.;45.8957;-93.2961
