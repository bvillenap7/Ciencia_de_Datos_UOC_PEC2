3 white balls of light form triangle and disappear.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-24 04:50:00;3-5 minutes;3 white balls of light form triangle and disappear. It was a clear stary morning.  As i looked up at the stars to the east, i noticed a line of stars just south of the big dipper that I've never remember seeing.  I continued to scan around the sky,and when i looked back at the line of stars they where no longer stationary.  They where moving east and getting in formation of a triangle.  Once a triangle was made all three lights just disappeared;47.4969;-92.2442
