Off to the left hand side of what had to be the most lightning I have ever seen come out of one cloud, was a black almost motionless object. The shape of it is hard to describe, but it was rounded on the top with pointed ridges on the bottom and points to either side.  I would say it was akin to a cookie broken in half. Only after watching for a few moments thinking it was shrinking did we realize it was moving into this cloud.  From my position in Gibbon, Minnesota, it appeared to be heading south-east toward  the Klossner or southern Lafayette. However, according to the national weather service this cloud was no more than 67 miles from us. This gives me an approximate distance of thirty to forty miles away from us at its closest point to us and was approximately the diameter of a full moon, at my first sighting. As we watched, the object continued toward and into the lightning cloud and faded from veiw.  I will forever wonder what my wife and I saw this evening.;44.5606;-94.5467
