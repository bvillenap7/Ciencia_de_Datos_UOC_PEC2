My husband was outside and called for me to come quickly and see a beautiful array of lightning in a storm going on.   As I looked at it longer I saw a black object in the center of it that looked like a saucer with dome on top as if looking at it from the side.  I looked at my husband and pointed to the sky and said am I crazy, or is there something in the sky right there?  He looked up and he saw the same thing that I did.  It was very close and seemed as if it was only a few miles away but your organization asked us to call the National Weather Service and we have now found out that the storm was 67 miles away in a town called New Richland, Minnesota.   We stood and watched this for several minutes and seemed me that it was there one second, and then it was gone.  However, my husband having better eye-sight, said it was simply that I couldn't see it anymore because it was heading into the storm and quickly being shrouded by this mysterious cloud.  I am originally from Florida and have never seen lightning act this way, nor seen anything like this dark, slow moving, silent object.;44.5606;-94.5467
