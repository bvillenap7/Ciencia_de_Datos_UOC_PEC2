I no;2001-01-08 21:00:00;2 secs;At approx 2100 hrs. local I was southbound on US Highway 75 approx 8 miles north of Crookston, MN. I was heading almost due south. I noticed a shooting star, but this was not run of the mill, I drive truck on a 12 hour night shift 1700 - 0500 and see lots of shooting stars and i usually check for active times (showers) on the internet.The one I saw this night was different in all respects...size, brilliance, colors and proximity in the sky. I had visual contact for 1.5 seconds or so. It was a brilliant white ball with a blue and tuquoise type of halo around the core following back to the tail. The tail was impressive. It was a bluish and turquoise color but what was unique, it had two tails of smimilar thickness and length. It was at about 50 degrees above my visible horizon and pased very quickly from east to west then faded like a regular run of the mill falling star.  It seemed to be closer to the earth with more of an arc in it's flight trajectory. Size about a dime at arms lentgh. What really struck me was it's beauty as it passed. When we got to our destination I asked the driver in the lead truck if he had seen it, He got a bit enthusiastic about it and remarked on the brillinace and the many colors and stated it was kinda pretty wans't it. The reason I decided to post this is i was listening to KOA in Denver and callers were calling in reporting an almost identical event this date some three days after my sighting. I do not blieve it was a UFO in the extraterrestrial sense but a metrorite or deorbiting satellite. I won't forget this one soon.;47.7768;-96.5924
