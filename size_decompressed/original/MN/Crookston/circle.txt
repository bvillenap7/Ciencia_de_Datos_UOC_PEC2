Round, silver UFO hovers over house, disappears in broad daylight;2009-02-10 12:00:00;15 seconds;Round, silver UFO hovers over house, disappears in broad daylight I was sitting in my 2nd floor bedroom and looking out my east-facing window at the sky, when I see a UFO enter my plain of view.  That day there was a snow storm and visibility was fairly bad.  The UFO hovered over my house and then stopped as I got a full look at it and then it took off east/south/east so fast that it was literally gone in the blink of an eye.  The craft was circular and seemed to made of a ailver/gray colored metal.  To be honest, it looked like an older craft. Like a UFO you would see in a science fiction move from the 50's or 60's.;47.7768;-96.5924
