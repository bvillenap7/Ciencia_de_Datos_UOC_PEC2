1-2 Second Green Flash in sky near Theodore Wirth Golf Course.;2017-01-24 18:30:00;5 seconds;1-2 Second Green Flash in sky near Theodore Wirth Golf Course. Driving at night on 394, headed towards downtown Minneapolis, and was about to merge onto 94 WEST...  All of a sudden there was a huge flash of green light that lit up the sky for maybe 1-2 seconds then turned yellow for maybe 1 second then was gone.  It was dark so this was super odd and not sure what to make of it.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
