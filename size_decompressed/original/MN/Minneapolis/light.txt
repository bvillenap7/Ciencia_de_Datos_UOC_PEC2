She lived in an older type house and all of the streets had big oak trees next to the sidewalk, well I told my girlfriend that we had to get going home so we all stood up and were making small talk next to one of the big oak trees facing her house and i remember looking up and this big glowing light was just pulsating at what seemed to be about tree top level we all asked each other do you see what i see and as we were looking at this thing glowing or pulsating it just wisked up in to the clear blue sky and disappeared.

(I had just let my dogs out in the backyard to go to the bathroom.)  The star was high in the sky, approximately 60 degrees or so from the horizon. The star then began to move.  It's movement is best described as squirmy and its form was constantly changing.  Small points of light dispersed from it, remaining very close and then it would all fuse back together.  It was ever changing in a constant state of flux. The star moved to the right and upward over the course of 2-3 minutes.  It covered a distance approx. twice the size of my double garage.  The garage is approx. 40-60 feet from my kitchen window. Soon after a light haze of clouds covered the sky and the star disappeared.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

It passed in front of (underneath) a high white cloud and was clearly bright and visible even with the white cloud as background.  It passed into the cloud and was not visible for less than a minute, then came out of the cloud and continued.  About 7 minutes after I first started watching the light, it stopped in the sky, and stayed in the same spot for about 2 minutes.  While I was looking at it, it suddenly vanished - suddenly it just wasn't there any more.  I looked all over the area of the sky but couldn't see a trace of it.  Then I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it, but no one else was at the bus stop with me. At 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, 6/24/99 I was waiting for my bus at what is known as 7 Corners on Washington Ave. in Minneapolis.  I was sitting on the bus stop bench on the south side of the street, facing north.  My bus wasn't due for about 15 minutes and I didn't have anything to read so I was just relaxing and looking around.  It was early rush hour and traffic was pretty heavy.  The sky was bright and blue with a few scattered high fluffy white clouds.  I was sitting in the shade and wearing sunglasses, so I was looking around very comfortably.  I was looking north (towards the Holiday Inn at 1500 Washington Ave.), and at 4:35 p.m. I was enjoying the lovely sky and watching a couple of high clouds when I noticed a light moving very slowly from west to east across the north sky.  It was very high up and I immediately thought oh, a satellite like I've seen on clear nights away from the city.  It looked very much like a satellite, but a little bigger, like a small star - as bright, white, and clear as a star on a clear night.  Then I realized it was broad daylight, and I wondered if it's possible to see a satellite (so bright and clear!) in the daylight.  I watched it carefully, curious to make out what it was - but it was too far away - just a light like a moving star.  As I watched it I looked at with and without my sunglasses, and it was clearly visible both ways.  I'd been watching it cross the sky slowly from west to east for about 2 or 3 minutes when it came to a cloud.  I expected to lose sight of it, but was surprised to be able to clearly see it with the cloud in the background.  Even though it was a white light on a white cloud, it was bright enough to see clearly.  Then it passed into the middle of the cloud and I lost sight of it for about 45 seconds.  It came out of the cloud again and I continued to watch it move slowly east.  Two or 3 minutes later it stopped.  I wondered if it was changing direction and kept watching closely, but it just stayed still for at least 2 minutes.  While it was ! just sitting there in the sky, a bus passed in front of me, blocking it from view.  I expected to lose sight of it, but after the bus passed by I could see the light clearly, still sitting in the same spot.  About 1 minute later it vanished.  I was looking at it, and then it was just not there anymore.  I looked all over to see where it had gone, but I couldn't see a trace of it. I looked around to see if anybody else had seen it, but there was no one else at the bus stop. My bus came and as I rode, I kept watching the north sky for a couple more minutes but couldn't see it anywhere.  I would really like to know if anyone else saw it and if anyone knows what it was!;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

The sky was still black when we saw a white light, brighter than an aircraft and about as bright as some of the night stars moving very fast from west to east. It moved in a horizontal line and did not appear to be a meteor etc., which I have seen bounce across the atmosphere as it moved across the horiz. It moved much faster than we were going (575 kts) and was much higher than an aircraft could fly. I was only visual on it for about 1 min. at the most and the Co-Pilot said he saw it a bit before I noticed it. What brought my attention to it was another airline pilot pointing it out to the Air Traffic control center and asking if they had any high altitude fast movers? They said NO. I called and told the other airline pilot and center that we aslo had the object in sight. That is it. Addenda to original report:  ((NUFORC Note:  Our request for more information.))

It actually was quite a bit more bright than Jupiter. Looking up again seconds later it was no longer bright at all and was only as bright as a normal star but it was moving and a second or two later was gone heading south. From where I first saw it to where it disappeared was only about the span of my outstretched hand. This same even happened a month and a half ago it nearly the same location. It was very similar in brightness until disappearance and length of time I saw it and the direction it went.

Circling Shiny Objects;2008-04-14 18:00:00;15 minutes;Circling Shiny Objects About 6pm, my husband and 2 kids were in our back yard and looked up to see what looked like a bird circling at a very high altitude, only it looked metallic. It was very high and appeared to be circular or possibly a cylinder shape.  We were facing east and the sun was behind us. It was still daylight with a clear blue sky. The object appeared to be reflecting the sun as its light varied as it moved in its circular path. It seemed that at certain points in the circle it was at a better angle for reflecting the sun. It was making circles and moving north, then it faded away for a while or moved too far away to see, then it returned and circled around some more.  At the time airplanes were landing in a path from Lake Harriet, southeast toward the airport. The planes were crossing under the area where these objects appeared to be circling, so they were very high up.  After about 10 minutes, we saw two identical lights circling in the same pattern in unison, again moving northward, then fading away, then returning to the same spot due east. We watched until they faded away again then went inside. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

Very bright light shining in western sky about 45 degrees up. There is a haze of light cloud cover, and no stars or celestial bodies visible. Light seems to be just below clouds. There is a slight haze around the light, which could be due to the haziness of the clouds. A couple low-flying airplanes have passed below it. It is not moving like a plane, but seems to wobble a little bit and light changes intensity, yet is very very bright. First explanation is that it could be Venus, but that would be lower to the horizon than this light. A friend with a telescope says he saw one bright light with 2 smaller lights on it too.

UFO - Viewed From Downtown Minneapolis, MN;2009-09-19 21:55:00;25 Min;UFO - Viewed From Downtown Minneapolis, MN Observation location:  Across the street from Orchestra Hall, 1210 Marquette Ave., Minneapolis, MN, looking down Marquette Ave. toward the Wells Fargo and IDS Towers. Description:  Object was a light, appearing from this vantage point to be above the Wells Fargo Tower.  The taller IDS Tower is located to the left of the Wells Fargo Tower, the object would typically move slowly from the right of the Wells Tower, left above the top of the Wells Tower, and continue further to the IDS Tower, and would go out of view behind the IDS Tower.  The object would come from behind the IDS Tower back over the Wells Tower, then move to the right beyond the Wells Tower, and back again. The object sometimes performed fast complete loops in the air, would abruptly stop, and would drift slowly once again.  Sometimes the object would change direction abruptly moving up, down, sideways, or diagonally at a high rate of speed, sometimes instantaneously changing direction at a high rate of speed several times before abruptly stopping and then beginning to drift again.  There were times when the object would appear to hover without moving for up to a minute.  On at least two occasions the object quickly, at a high rate of speed, darted down at a diagonal between the towers toward the ground, covering two thirds the height of the Wells Tower in perhaps one half second.  There were times when the object would go dark and reappear several seconds later, sometimes at the same, sometimes at a different location.  There were times when the object would become dim, then brighter.  There were times when the object would appear to pulsate in intensity.  The second witness, ! a woman who stopped to watch, stated that the object changed colors. Luminosity:  Variable, from dark to dim, but often about as bright as Jupiter would appear in a dark sky.  Note that downtown Minneapolis is highly lit at night, as is the Wells Tower itself. Other:  The aircraft obstruction light on the antenna mast at the top of the IDS Tower functioned normally during the entire observation.  Several large commercial aircraft, apparently on approach to MSP International, made typical runs across the general area appearing to be at a higher elevation than the object observed.  There was an advertising searchlight scanning the sky in Minneapolis that night but it had no effect upon the observation of this object.  I observed the light for twenty five minutes, left and returned twenty minutes later to find the object still presenting itself as before.  I left and returned once again thirty minutes after the second observation and could observe no trace of the object. Opinion:  This was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or bird.  The abrupt stops, instantaneous change of direction, zig-zagging, and fast rates of speed, loops, and abrupt stops are inconsistent with such explanations.

Another sighting.  This time I had the chance to pull out my phone.  Strange extremely bright light in the dark night.  Different than a star.  The first bright light moved across horizontally, then suddenly vanished.  Faded.  Disappeared.   After I was done recording the first bright light, I noticed a second brighter light.  As you can see in the second video.  Planes fly above us all the time and the that was most definitely not a plane.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

They came down vertically, made a 90 degree turn to the right, and disappeared into the night ski. I did reord this event on my phone. As I was going back into O my house J saw another light appear in the same area. I started record again. I saw 48 lights come down, make a right turn, and then make left turn following the same path.This video lasts for 4.5 minutes. Since then I can regularly sit out at night and see lights traveling in straight lines, stop and turn around and repeat. Mapping a pattern of grids.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
