Un vieux témoignage;1983-05-02 09:00:00;5';Un vieux témoignage En francais, Lieu : Hôtel RAMADA au bord de l'autoroute près de l'aéroport. Date : lundi 02 mai 1983 09h00 am. J'attendais l'arrivée de mon correspondant local dans la chambre de l'hôtel RAMADA, située à l'extrémité de celui-ci (à ma gauche, je peux voir par la fenêtre l'écran géant d'un cinéma de plein-air). Mon attention a été attirée par le bruit d'un hélicoptère de l'US AIR-FORCE. A son bord, un militaire équipé d'un télé-objectif. En regardant dans la direction qu'il visait, j'ai vu décoller 3 soucoupes, à quelques centaines de mètres de taille supérieure à un 747. La forme était celle d'une madeleine retournée (gros renflement de l'hémisphère inférieur). La matière n'était pas celle des avions normaux, si brillante, on aurait dit de l'opale blanc laiteux ou peut-être de la céramique. Les engins décollaient selon une pente d'environ 45° comme un avion et elles ont vite disparues dans la couche nuageuse assez basse et dense ce jour là.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
I saw a disk hovering above some suburbs with a light shinning down below before disappearing in a streak of light.;1998-07-15 01:00:00;10 seconds;I saw a disk hovering above some suburbs with a light shinning down below before disappearing in a streak of light. I am 24 and i live in Edinburgh, Scotland. I was in Minneapolis in July 1998 visiting my cousins with my parents. They live in suburbs of Minneapolis.  One night around 1am i couldn't sleep because i was too hot, being from Scotland im not used to the heat! I got up to open a window but the problem was there was a mesh on the inside to stop mosquitos. I coludn't work out how to open it so was at the window for quite some time. It was then that i noticed a light in the corner of my eye. Looking out the window across the suburbs i could see a disk shaped craft hovering above a small clump of trees in the middle of the suburbs. It was about 500 yards away. It was clear to see because the house i was in was on a hill and the suburbs sloped away from it so there was nothing obstructing my view. I was almost looking slightly down on the craft. The craft was dark in colour, about 100 feet wide and thin from top to bottom, maybe only 10 or 15 feet. There were also small lights in the middle of the craft around its circumfrance. There was a green beam of light shinning from the middle of the underside of the craft down into the trees below. It was about 15-20 feet wide and panned out fractionaly futher from the craft. I watched it for about 10seconds or so then the light shut off. Without any noise the craft disappeared in a streak of orange light leading up to the right into the night sky. It was as if it had almost instantly accelerated to a speed hundreds of times faster than any plane, simply too fast to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

Dogs starting barking On the block.   It  flew overhead about 50 feet over the tallest tree.  Very slowly. It had a formation of lights on the bottom.  It was almost like an upside down Wok With a row of white lights in the middle and four red lights in each corner.  I stood And watched it quietly proceed to the highway.  No sound at all!  Afterwards	 When I came in, my hands had a burning smell to them and my fingers tingled. I have no idea why!

A couple driving to the north toward Duluth witness a disc-shaped object cross the road in front of them.;2012-01-31 11:42:00;Minutes;A couple driving to the north toward Duluth witness a disc-shaped object cross the road in front of them.  Sighting occurred during daylight hours, at 11:42 a.m. on January 31st, 2012. Telephoned Report:  A man and wife called to report have witnessed a disc-shaped craft cross the road in front of their automobile, as they drove from Minneapolis to Duluth.  It was so close, they reported, that they could see various details on the exterior surface of the craft. The object crossed the road in front of them, and then disappeared behind trees to their right.  Then, a short time later, it appeared again, traveling in a different direction.  It disappeared from their sight a second time, and then reappeared, providing them with a third sighting of the strange object. The couple were traveling north, and were approximately 2 hours' drive south of Duluth. The witnesses will submit their own report, sometime in the near future.  Their ability to write a report has been delayed by a death in their family.  They will submit a report, once they return to their home.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Object in sky with two cone lights shining down.;2015-03-14 09:40:00;3 minutes;Object in sky with two cone lights shining down. While driving east on 694 I saw this craft.  It looked like an elongated egg with two bright white lights on the bottom (shaped like 2 snow cones), pointed toward the ground.  I followed it as I drove to work.  The object was moving in the same direction as me, but was ahead of me.   I took my cell phone and took three photos of this event.  When I got to work, I looked at the photos and enlarged them.  I was shocked at the clarity and of what the camera showed.  It is a disk shaped object with lights.  Very clear, not a plane or helicopter.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

Saw a HUMONGOUS UFO very low downtown moving through the skyscrapers;2018-08-06 22:00:00;2 minutes;Saw a HUMONGOUS UFO very low downtown moving through the skyscrapers I was driving from hwy 55 to where it merges to 94 west right near downtown, around 10pm.  Saw a HUMONGOUS UFO very low, and moving slow downtown, it looked like it was going through the skyscrapers, ~300 feet or less off the ground.  South-east side of the city.  It had red lights and I might have told myself it was a plane except it was moving through the buildings, not above them.   Was driving in the passenger seat so I lost sight of it after about 5 seconds.  It was huge and caught my eye right away.

Found a UFO while running, took photos.;2020-08-31 00:30:00;10 minutes;Found a UFO while running, took photos. I was running around bde Maka ska in Minneapolis.  As running a 12 year old kid on a bike stopped me, somewhat weird because it was 12:30 am he said excuse me and asked me whether this disk in the air looked like a UFO.  I almost ignored him but then I did see it. You could see 12 or so lights in a disc formation.  I took a couple photos with and without night sight.  I also took a selfie because I wanted to prove more that it was real.  I'm not sure if that does.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
