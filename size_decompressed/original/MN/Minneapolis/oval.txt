Flashing Ring floats S-SW from Minneapolis view area 45 minutes;2005-08-29 21:30:00;45 minutes;Flashing Ring floats S-SW from Minneapolis view area 45 minutes From Maple Grove MN looking south recognized an odd flickering of light for what I would expect to be a star or planet.  Watched for 10 minutes noticing that the object moved ver slow across the sky.  Used aircraft leaving MSP Airport as reference to object as they were moving many miles closer to my location.  Could discern what apeared to be red and green blinking lights.  Retrieved binoculars and telescope. Binoculars confirmed the twinkling light, but unable to see much else other than the slow movement S to SW. 21:45 set up telescope and targeted object.  Clearly saw what appeared to be a planar ring shape glowing modest white/yellow light, with bright white lights flashing around the diameter in an orderly counter-clockwise direction.  Ring did not appear completely rigid, but could have been as it may have been wobbling or deforming.  Object appeared to remain planar, and did not expand or contract.  Looked much like what you would see under a microscope looking at a small bacteria or sea animal.  Green and Red lights would periodically flash from what I can best describe as directly perpendicular to the ring plane.  Looked like a donut with an imaginary center post kind of like a spinning top.   As the object moved to the SW, it fell below the house and tree lines and I gave up watching about 22:15.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

Object flew into my peripheral vision in the East sky (from Downtown Minneapolis).  I realized it was not a plane, as it was moving too quickly, and that it was not a bird as it looked to be too far away and was flying too straight.   As I turned my head to focus on the object it stopped dead and shot off and incredible speed, seemingly upward into space.   The object was far away, oval in shape, and I couldn't tell what color it was.  There was no sound and I didn't notice any environmental effects.   I was basically just laying on my couch watching television when I noticed it out the window to my left.  It frightened me.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
