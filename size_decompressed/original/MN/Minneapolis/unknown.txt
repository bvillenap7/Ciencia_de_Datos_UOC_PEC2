The red and green lights were in a triangular configuration and just hovered above the airport with no sound;1977-05-15 23:00:00;10 min. +;The red and green lights were in a triangular configuration and just hovered above the airport with no sound In approximately May of 1977 a friend of mine and I were at the Crystal Airport (MIC), Minneaplis, MN, at approximately 2300 hours local time. We had both recently received our pilot's licenses and were avid flyers.  My friend's father owned a flying school at the airport.   We had just returned from an evening of night flying and had put the airplane in the hangar.  The night sky was very clear with stars showing brightly.  At this time of night air traffic in the Minneapolis area was very light.  During this event there were no aircraft operations at the MIC airport.   My friend and I were talking outside at the airport and noticed some colored lights hovering in a stationary position directly above the MIC airport.  At first we thought these lights may be a helicopter, balloon, or some other type of stationary craft.  As my friend was interested in star gazing and had his telescope at the airport building, we got the telescope out to look at these lights.  We both observed, over a period of at least 10 minutes, three lights, in a tringular configuration, consisting of green and red lights, each of these being in a triangular shape, hovering directly over the airport, altitude unknown.  We believed the lights to be maybe about 10,000 feet MSL because it took the power of the telescope to clearly see them.   The three lights appeared to wobble in the triangular configuration and they did not move or change altitude.  We were both very surprised that the lights, which we believed were attached to some type of solid, trianglar object, ommited no sound whatsoever.  Other than the lights, we could not actually see any type of object to which they could have been attached as it was dark night at this time.  The MIC control tower was closed at that time, so we could not contact them for confirmation of what this object may have been.  After about 10-15 minutes of observation the lights just disappeared.

Fast moving blue-white light.;1999-09-06 00:40:00;:02;Fast moving blue-white light. I went outside in my back yard to have a cigarette at 12:40 Sunday night. I was sitting on a picnic tale looking up at the stars in the eastern sky when I saw a large blue-white light moving very quickly from southeast to northwest. It startled me. It was gone behind my house before I could stand up to see where it went. I remember thinking, Shit, that thing is moving fast! I thought it might be a shooting star, but it was very bright, moved incredibly fast, and did not have a tail. It did not look like any other shooting stars I have ever seen. I did not hear any sound associated with this object. I am a 30 year old, college educated male. I work in the vocational rehabilitation field.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
They were visible, then invisible, light red almost pinkish round, but not clear definition of shape.;2011-06-15 15:00:00;5+ hours;They were visible, then invisible, light red almost pinkish round, but not clear definition of shape. So, it was 3 pm when my mother went to sit outside and noticed something move far into the sky.  The ufo seen was not any particular shape, but I can describe as round.  Like a light red sort of pinkish.  No lights or anything shiny...  They were about 5 or 6, maybe more of these round things that were visible, then invisible.  Nothing metallic, like in the movies.  They were hovering over the city as we could see.   As hours went by, they were hovering closer and closer on top of where we were.  They had a peaceful movement as they appeared and again disappeared.  Constantly moving.  I was AMAZED, for nothing, absolutely nothing could describe fully what we saw.  We stared up into the sky for hours!!!   A few people gathered at the place where we were to see.  Neighbors, friends and family.  We tried to take a video but the objects could not be seen as with our eyes.   We were not scared but more so AMAZED.  We pretty much stared until our necks hurt!

Objects Generating Intense Burst Of Light And Disapear;2012-06-27 02:00:00;10 minutes;Objects Generating Intense Burst Of Light And Disapear My sightings have been over the past year and it usually involves 1 object at a time. I regularly watch the skies for moving lights and can tell the difference between satellites and other objects.  Over the last year,  early in the morning  when the skies are clear I have witnessed individual lights moving in a pattern inconsistent with any satellites usually diagonal across the sky instead of North to South or East to West.  Some of the objects are brighter than any stars and do not blink. Some blink very brightly without a consistent pattern.  What is most puzzling is that I have followed these objects across the sky and then suddenly there is an intense flash and it disappears.  It reminds me of Star Trek when a ship jumps to light speed.  My background: I have worked in IT Security, Legal and Compliance for many very large corporations for the past 22 years.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

Object in sky red, green, white lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights at nearby casino.  PD));2016-03-20 00:30:00;30 minutes;Object in sky red, green, white lights Let the dogs out at about 12:30 a.m. on 3/20/16.  Noticed twinkling object in the sky, got the binoculars and viewed an object in the sky.  It was about 30 degrees above the horizon, possibly five miles away, approximately above Lake Minnetonka area.  It was not moving.  It appeared to be flashing red, green and white lights.   I watched this object for at least 30 minutes, suspecting that it was some type of aircraft, waiting for it to move in the sky.  It didn't - I went to bed.  Drone maybe?  Anyone else see this?

Bright light appears to have form of a triangular craft when I zoom in.;2019-05-26 15:58:00;3 minutes;Bright light appears to have form of a triangular craft when I zoom in. Close to 4 PM, we sat outside because we were done cutting the grass. Looked up at the sky and I asked my momma “do you remember the sky was the same, when we saw the red orbs” and Bam!  I spot a UFO in the sky.  This one was not an orb, I thought it was longer light. Vertically.  As I zoomed closer it appeared different.  I have been studying the images I took and zoomed in again, and am able to see a triangular shape.  You can see very clearly the form.  They were a few different things happening as we were looking at that direction.  We could spot more than one object.  I took a couple of videos hoping that at least one would capture the right image.  In the video that I play repeatedly, you can also clearly see how something shoots out of the bigger object.  The object appears and disappears.  When they appear again it was slightly a different area.  Not the same spot.  At some point, it moved above us.  Extremely high in the sky I would not even be able to calculate ! how far up it was.  I do know it was above us because that’s where it stopped and then left.  We were not able to see it after that.  By left I mean disappeared.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
