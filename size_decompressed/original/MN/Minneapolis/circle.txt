White high-altitude object suspended over Twin Cities and witnessed for 12 hours;2004-08-19 18:00:00;3.5 hours;White high-altitude object suspended over Twin Cities and witnessed for 12 hours On the 19th of August, I witnessed a round white object over the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul) area around 18:00.  The earliest reports I heard were 9am in the morning and it was there until dark. I personally did not hear about it until around 6pm in the evening when a small blurb was mentioned on the radio.  The object drifted slowly but not very far while under my observations and exhibited no unusual characteristics that one would expect if this were a high-altitude research balloon.  The meteorologists from the local TV stations said that it was above the cirrus clouds indicating an altitude greater than 30,000.  This would make the object VERY big indeed.  A local person with a high-powered telescope viewing it said it did indeed look like a balloon.  Perhaps that would satisfy most people's questions, but how does an untethered balloon stay in basically the same position for at LEAST 12 hours in a row?  Especially in the Midwest where fronts are blowing through every few days?  Perhaps it was the center of a very slow moving low pressure system?  Officially, NO ONE has claimed ownership for the object and there has been NO official explaination.  Here are some links to various local TV stations that covered (briefly) the event:  http://wcco.com/localnews/local_story_232202348.html http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/4938203.html http://www.kstptv5.com/article/stories/s1972.html http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2004/08/20.html#ufo http://www.visi.com/~rschwa/arspix/IMG_2068.JPG  Here is a photo that I took, although it was almost dark by the time I got home to get my camera.

Round white object over Minneapolis that disappeared;2011-08-07 18:30:00;6 seconds;Round white object over Minneapolis that disappeared Sitting in the back yard near Lake Nokomis, I looked up at the sky and saw a circular-shaped white object moving in a straight line west to east.  It was not a jet or any other kind of plane, not even close--just a white circular object.   It was very distant, but if I were to hold up something to compare it to, it would have been about the size of a dime from my perspective.  It was moving rather slowly and in a very steady, straight line.   I turned to my friend to ask him, What is that? and when I turned back to the sky one second later to point at it, the object was gone.  Completely disappeared, and I had a wide view of the sky.   There are always a lot of airplanes taking off over this neighborhood, which is near the MSP Airport, but this was not plane-shaped and it flew much higher: a jet at 30,000 feet or so reflecting light would not be as large and would not look like a white ball.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

Minneapolis lights are believed to be from Mystic Lake Casino in Shakopee, MN.  ((NUFORC Note:  We agree.

Monday evening I witnessed the same ring of lights recently reported in Minneapolis, MN. My guess is these lights are being beamed from Mystic Lake Casino in Shakopee, MN. Interesting as the photograph currently on your home page is identical to my sighting on Monday. Although I've never seen these lights in the past, Mystic Lake beams other lights into the sky, as well. ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the assessment by the witness.

One big light and two smaller lights on each side.It stayed motionless for about 5 minutes then the lights turned offand that was it. Me and my son was very scared and have never seen anything like that ever.  I know that it was not an airplane because how big the lights were and it was like it turned invisible and it made no noise or any movement at all.  It was either a U.F.O or secret military air craft.  I know what I saw.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
