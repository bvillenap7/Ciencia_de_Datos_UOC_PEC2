Small Cylinder seen in absolutely clear sky in morning. Heading north on Hwy 35w. No other objects in sky whatsoever.;1999-11-15 07:45:00;10-15 min;Small Cylinder seen in absolutely clear sky in morning. Heading north on Hwy 35w. No other objects in sky whatsoever. I and a friend were car pooling to our job from Edina to Roseville, Mn. Heading north  on Hwy 35w. I noticed it first and was unsure of what I was seeing. I wached it for about 3-4 minutes w/o saying anything so that I could be sure. The sky was completely clear. The weather was crisp and slightly cold. It was low in the sky (say about the size of a pen point at first sighting and as we drew closer by about 10 miles about the size of a pencil eraser at arms length). It was a very dark color...Gray bordering on black. At first it had definite edges. It reflected light at the edges. It stayed in one spot, seemingly motionless. I mentioned to my friend after a few minutes who is a skeptic and asked him, What the h*ll is that?.  He didn't know either.  By the time we were as close to it as we were going to get it had dissipated into a cylinder shaped cloud or mist and was losing shape slowly. My father being a pilot I grew up around airports, airplanes and airshows and have always kept an eye to the sky. I have never seen anything like it. If it was a cloud, why would one tiny, dark cloud form in a sky barren of any other weather formations? My friend was a little bothered by it and chalked it up to weather. I'm not so sure.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Silver cylindrical object no wings no vapor trail no sound passing SE to NW just before sundown.;2004-11-07 16:30:00;6 TO 10 SECS.;Silver cylindrical object no wings no vapor trail no sound passing SE to NW just before sundown. Before sunset straight-line flight from SE to NW silver may have had reddish color at the leading end no visible wings no vapor trail no discernable sound.  It passed beneath the dispersed contrail of a jet, but appeared to be at some altitude(maybe 20,000 feet?).  Object was 5 or 6 times longer than wide and blunt at each end.  The rate of passage from my perspective was similar to a jet airplane, but the impression was that it was not being propelled so much as gliding.  It was first spotted by my 5-year old grandson, who asked what it was.  I looked up expecting to see an airplane.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

I turned around at 50th and by the time I reached 46th it was gone.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
