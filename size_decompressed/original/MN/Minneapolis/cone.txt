low flying cone shaped craft spotted in the city.  ((anonymous report));2019-12-04 22:36:00;1 minute;low flying cone shaped craft spotted in the city I was laying in bed looking out of the window when this dull cone stopped maybe 3 miles away in the air.  It looked like it was shaped like a cone, and it was glowing a little.  No visible lights, it had some sort of aura.  I immediately got up to see it closer.  It hovered for a couple seconds then it went in a straight line real fast back in the direction where it came. It lasted about a minute and I don't know if anyone else saw it, for I was alone.  Couldn't have been a plane, it was too low in the sky, and it was hovering, it moved way too fast and sharp.  Absolutely terrifying experience for me.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
