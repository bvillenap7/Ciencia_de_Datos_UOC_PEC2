Three faint blue triangles high in the sky.;2003-09-04 03:15:00;20 Mins.;Three faint blue triangles high in the sky. I'm amazed. I hope someone else saw some of this too. I arrived home at approx. 3:15 in the morning on sept. 4. as I was walking toward the house from the back alley/driveway I noticed what appeared to be a sattelite moving slowly from southeast to northwest. I didn't think much of it, other than it was quite bright, and seemed a bit low in the sky. It also was a tiny bit orange-ish in color which I thought was odd, but it was partly cloudy so I thought it may be just something to do with the atmosphere. Then I noticed the strange part. Moving at the same speed, and in the same direction, were three faint blue triangles of lights, all about a hands legnth(to the eye) apart from each other. They were each about the size of my thumb across, which seems quite large for how high they appeared to be. I immediately ran in the house and grabbed my video camera. I came back out to film the objects(which were moving very slow) but the darkness of the sky, and the lightness of the city made it impossible to see anything on my viewfinder, so I was unable to get any footage. The objects slowly moved out of veiw to the northeast. I also saw probably five to ten shooting stars, but I doubt if they were related in any way.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
20-30 orbs in birdlike formation heading east from west. City lights illuminated bottoms of orbs;2008-04-16 21:05:00;20 seconds;20-30 orbs in birdlike formation heading east from west. City lights illuminated bottoms of orbs My wife and I just witnessed approximately 20-30 orbs flying high in the sky. They are currently heading east (from the west). The formation is almost birdlike. The orbs were moving in a group type formation in what looks like a flying w type formation. The bottoms or the visible portions were what looked like a mirror. The tops were not visible.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Orange/blue light-ball cluster over downtown Minneapolis 1/17/13.;2013-01-17 21:45:00;15 minutes;Orange/blue light-ball cluster over downtown Minneapolis 1/17/13 Leaving a Minnesota Timberwolves game in downtown Minneapolis at approx. 9:45-10:00 PM January 17th, 2013, and walking south, my friend and I noticed strange lights in the sky.   There appeared to be about 5 large orange lights and maybe 4 smaller blue lights, all in a small cluster.  The lights appeared to be above a light layer of clouds, very high in the sky.   Currently, the clouds are 9000 feet in the sky, and wind is moving 5 mph from the southwest (currently one hour later).   The lights were not moving, and appeared to make “smear” like shapes in the sky (especially the orange lights).   There were about 3 other witnesses that we pointed out the lights to that were also stunned by the lights.  The lights eventually faded out after about 15 minutes.   We were not able to see any stars or anything else in the sky.  The shapes were circular to oval, and appeared “smeared” (maybe due to cloud cover).   Spotlights were shining into the sky from downtown Minneap! olis (due to clubs/bars), and as the lights hit the orange balls, the balls would seem to quickly illuminate from the light reflection.   We have a good picture that shows what we saw as well.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
UFOs (?) discovered in pictures taken in broad daylight on sunny afternoon.  I only saw the objects after downloading the pics.;2014-09-07 16:10:00;~5 minutes;UFOs (?) discovered in pictures taken in broad daylight on sunny afternoon. I only saw the objects after downloading the pics. I did not observe these craft at the time of the incident, but only saw late them in photos I took (two photos 3 seconds apart).  I was out taking photos at a park near my home. It was a sunny afternoon and I took some pics of the sun behind a large tree and a commercial jet making a contrail next to tree (visually speaking). I did not notice several small shapes to the right as I was focused on the tree when taking the pictures. My camera is an iPhone 5s. I can send you the picture setting details if that helps.  So, I took two photos where the objects appear. They were taken 3 seconds apart, but, the objects have changed shape and are apparently further away and in a different area of the sky (you can see this in the two photos). I have enlarged these images and looked at them from different angles and experimented with changing the contrast and sharpness of the pics. You can judge for yourself but so far I have not been able to debunk them as balloons or Chinese lanterns or conventional aircraft. To me the second picture has even more oddness to it in several respects.  If these are UFOs, my impression is that they are possibly trans-dimesional, based on the shape changes and the difficulty deterring the exact shape of the objects (edges are a bit fuzzy for example). I would interested in hear what you think.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Light formation in sky and similar pattern reflected on people in photos taken an hour earlier.;2017-05-06 21:41:00;20 minutes;Light formation in sky and similar pattern reflected on people in photos taken an hour earlier. Seven of us were hanging out on our rooftop deck and I pointed out two lights above us behind the fast moving clouds.  We couldn’t tell if the lights were moving slowing for about 5 minutes and then stopped, or was stationary the entire time.  For about 20 minutes the lights remained still as we watched them dim and brighten behind the moving clouds.  We could see a faint third light which created a triangular formation.  However, the photos suggest there may have been more lights than what we could see by eye. Heavier clouds rolled through and, once cleared, the lights were gone. About 20 minutes after the light formation disappeared, we saw a very bright aircraft fly overhead.  We all agreed it was an airplane, yet it did appear to be much brighter, faster and and closer than what we typically see in the area.  Our condo is directly under a flight path and we also acknowledged that no airplanes had been seen since we first noticed the lights. Then this morning (the next day), I was reviewing our photos from the evening and noticed a single green formation on my friend’s left shoulder.  It appears on the chest of the person sitting next to him in a different photo. Attached are photos of the formation we saw in the sky and a zoomed in photo of the pattern on my friend. 20:04 Photos of friends 21:30 Noticed two lights in the sky 21:41 Photos of lights. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness provides a number of high-quality photographs.  The green objects, seen against the arm and shoulder of one of the people present, suggests to us that there is a flaw in the camera.  The other lights appear to us to be reflected from the bottoms of clouds, which suggests advertising lights, although we cannot be certain.  PD));44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
