Large trinagular craft spotted over Mpls, MN in 1975;1975-06-01 23:00:00;4 min;Large trinagular craft spotted over Mpls, MN in 1975 In either late '75 or early (jan-mar) '76 my husband and I were driving through a neighborhood known as North Minneapolis. I was in the passenger seat.  My husband suddenly hit the brakes and exclaimed What the hell is that?.  He had stopped where a large elm tree blocked my view and he moved forward.  When he did I looked to my left and saw about 100 feet above the houses, a large triangular craft.  it was moving in parallel to us but in the opposite direction.  While I kept the craft in view my husband went the short distance to the end of the block and turned the corner to follow it.  I do not recall any lights, the craft was a medium gray and from what I could perceive the only way we were able to see it at all was that it was so close to the ground the street lights were illumination the bottom.  I looked specifically for any openings for landing gear etc but the bottom was smooth.  It was winter so the windows were rolled up and the heater was on so I dont know that it made any sound.  As we followed it down the block it appeared to be moving at no more than 10 miles and hour.  I looked to see if lights were going on and if people were coming out of their homes but did not see any unusual activity.  We did turn another corner to keep it in sight and that is when I saw what I call an army jeep with a young blond bespectacled male soldier standing outside the jeep with one hand on the steering wheel, the other on the door and one foot just on the inside of the car.  He was also staring at the craft. As we passed him I looked at his face but he did not seem to notice us.  I observed that the craft was accelerating and told my husband to drive faster. With a sudden burst of speed the craft was gone.  I dont know if it moved away from any light source and so became impossible to see but it did seem to me that it simply vanished.  We tried to continue in the direction in which the craft was headed and came to a point where we could see a bridge crossing the Mississippi.  I felt that if any! one on t he bridge was seeing it that traffic would come to a halt but this did not happen.  He is now my ex-husband and about 25 years after this happened I asked him if he remembered what we saw.  He remembers that the craft had lights and that there was more than one military vehicle at the scene.  I know that people use football fields as a measure but I am not familiar with the size of football fields so I can only tell you that it measured the length of three small single family homes driveways included.  I did not report it to the police as my then husband feared ridicule but I have always been curious as to whether others saw the same thing that night.  I have run into many people who did not strike me as mentally stable who are involved in such organizations as MUFON and so when I say you on a news program I thought perhaps you were the person to report this too.

Sighting of triangle object and caveman (yeah, I know--sounds like I am out of my mind, but there were two of us);1975-06-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;Sighting of triangle object and caveman (yeah, I know--sounds like I am out of my mind, but there were two of us) I was at the website and read the article about submitting sights that have happened in the past, well--I have a doozey!!   I was 17 and it was the summer of 1975 in Minneapolis Minnesota.  My 'friend-boy' (he was 22) was walking me back to my apartment where I lived with my family.  We stopped to talk and were standing in the Phyllis Wheatley elementary school field that separated the school from my apartment building by about an acre.  The street was about a half a block away to my right and his left, facing the apartment building.  Across from the apartment building was another apartment complex. It was about a half an hour before sunset on a very clear evening.  Around the perimeter of the field, there were a lot of tall trees.  We were engrossed in a very good conversation when I notice to my left, something coming through the tops of the trees.  It didn't make a sound but it was as big as a very large house.  It was black and shaped like a very narrow triangle.  It has lights on each point and a big 'spotlight' typed light in the middle.  It whoosed over the very tops of the trees, so close that we both ducked, thinking it was going to hit us.  I asked him if he saw what I had just seen and we both definately agreed that what we saw was shaped like nothing we had ever seen before.  Now, here is where it gets very, VERY strange.  Not more that one minute later, as we were engrossed in conversation about the object we had just saw, I noticed movement, this time over my right shoulder.  Coming out of the bushes next to one of the apartment buildings across the street was a caveman!!   I stopped in mid sentence and my friend noticed and followed my eyes.  He then asked me if I saw what he was seeing.  I said that yes, I see a caveman!!  We both watched as the caveman parted the bushes holding what looked like a large tree branch in his left hand.  He was not very tall and had on what looked like brown fur around his mid-section.  The color of his skin was light beige.  He didn't make a sound but stared at us as we stared at him.  What broke the concentration was when I screamed.   The caveman then started coming towards us--but he moved like he was under water or mechanical.  I could NOT move from where I was standing because I could NOT stop staring at this very strange sight!  Finally my friend grabbed my hand and said to me to stop staring and start running!  I had on a pair of yellow Japanese shoes that I had to kick off because my friend was pulling me so fast.  I turned to look behind us and the caveman was so close that I could see that his bared mouth bore yellow teeth.  When he ran, it was in that mechanical, under water way--like he could not control his movements--but that didn't stop him from moving so fast!  He looked like he was caught in the beams of a strobe light.  As we reached the steps of my building, I looked back again but only saw his hand as it was ready to grab me just under my shoulder.   Thank goodness the building's main entrance door was always unlocked!!  We got in the building and my apartment door was unlocked as well (because my siblings were home).  I locked the apartment door behind us and we both ran to the front window to see if we could see him anywhere but all we saw were my parents who were just pulling up.   We both looked at each other in puzzlement, then ran right back to the door--he snatched it open only to find an empty entryway.  The caveman was gone just that quick!  We both ran out to help my parents with the groceries--both talking a mile a minute about our experience.  When we got back inside, my mom asked us what the thing in the sky looked like.  We described it to her and my dad.  My mom suddenly had to sit down and they both just stared at each other.   My Mom then told us that that was the same object they saw, along with about 50 others, just the week before.  They had been stopped at a light at a very busy intersection and she said everyone was jumping out of their cars pointing at it.  She said they all got an excellent look at it because it was moving slowly across the sky.  I remember her showing us the newspaper clipping about it.

Giant triangle-shaped craft at very low altitude right over North Minneapolis;1993-07-15 19:00:00;1 Minute?;Giant triangle-shaped craft at very low altitude right over North Minneapolis Sometime in the Summer of 1993, when I was 12 years old, me, my brother, and my best friend ((name deleted)) were playing outside. We were going about our business as usual on the blacktop hill at the school across the street from my house. The weather was perfect.  At any rate, I saw ((name deleted)) eyes get real wide as he looked at the sky. I looked up and what I saw was amazing. I saw what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft of some kind. I can clearly recall that the bottom was bordered with a green glowing light, and there was a large circular orange light right in the middle of the bottom of the craft. So basically, I was looking a a big green-rimmed triangle with a circular orange light in the center.  When I first looked at it it seemed like it was quite far away. Like it was  just passing overhead. But to my mixed horrer/awe/excitement as soon as I looked at the damned thing it slowly but surely started coming right at me. It felt as though I were attached to it by some kind of string, and that by looking at it I was pulling it towards me. Like we were magnetically attracted and we had reached the point of no return, and a collision was inevitable. I also had this odd feeling that everything but me and the object had ceased to exist. I mean, everything was still around me, but it was like everything but me and the ship was on pause or something.  As it descended towards me I watched in awe as it just kept coming closer, and closer, and closer. And the closer it came, the bigger I realized it was. Eventually the thing got so low that I thought it would squash me along with 3/4 of my city block. It was truly amazing. It was gigantic, and it came down right over me in the middle of North Minneapolis! I would have expected chaos around me if I had been thinking clearly. I mean, cars should have been pulled over honking, people should have been yelling, etc... But no. Complete calm. And the calm seemed perfectly natural to me.  So, when the ship had come so low that i could hit it with a baseball it was like I snapped out of a trance and panic overwhelmed me. I immediately burst towards my front door across the street. Upon my first step was the first time my brother and my friend had entered my awareness since I first spotted the object.  I don't actually remember physically running across the street, but that may have been due to pure panic. Anyway, I got to the door with my brother and friend scrambling right behind me. I took one last look up as I darted into the house, and there was nothing there.  An odd side note. My brother only remembers seeing the thing from a very far distance. He remembers a big ass light far up in the sky and that's about it. ((name deleted)) remembers the thing descending, but he doesn't remember it getting nearly as close as I do.

The following sighting reports are very similar to the one my mother, father, North Minneapolis and I had back in 1975. This is the sec;2006-03-13 22:30:00;15 mins;The following sighting reports are very similar to the one my mother, father, North Minneapolis and I had back in 1975. This is the second time it's happened to a friend of mine, his story:   He said he was walking home from the store during the Monday night snowstorm and as he approached his building, he noticed three women in high-school cheerleader mini-skirts walking silently behind him (he mentioned that they were silent because he said that he only heard his own footfall as it crunched into the snow). When he turned back around he noticed what he first thought to be alot of police cars. Then he said because of the size of it, maybe a large construction crew working on Lyndale Ave N.  As he climbed the steps of his building, he noticed that the women had lined up side-by-side, standing at the foot of the steps but were facing and staring at the construction sight.   Everything was silent and this is when he said he got the sudden urge to run into the building.  He said he went straight to the Recreation Room because the window there gives you a direct sight to the street where the construction sight and the women were.   This is when he got a clear view of what he said was this huge object hovering over the street about tree level.  It was silent, black, or either a very dark color, and had a row of flashing, dancing, lights running along the bottom perimeter of it.  He said what was also astonding is that the object was about as large as a football field.  ' He also noticed that the street--which is usually busy--did not have ANY traffic at all.  (I was born and raised there too so I know this particular street and it is ALWAYS busy--just like a freeway.)  He said he then started running around inside the building to all his neighbor's, knocking on their doors trying to get someone to come and see the object--finally finding someone after approximately 15 minutes.  He said he told this person, Man, come and see this shit!  But when they got to the window, the craft was gone.  He said the guy then asked him, What shit?, and my friend said he told him, Man...NEVER MIND  He saw this very same object back in 1979 while with a group of friends. That sighting lasted for about 10 minutes as a triangular-shaped object moved slowly in their field of vision from right to left.  I must say that these encounters are similar in that there is an eerie calm and that sometimes no-one seems to be around or is arousable when these experiences happen--obviously they set it up this way.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
