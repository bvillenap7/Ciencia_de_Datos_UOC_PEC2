There seemed to be no pattern to it. I was traveling back to Michigan on a redeye flight.  We were at about 15 thousand feet.  It was about 15 minutes to 6 am.  We were over minneapolis.  The object was perfectly round and just sitting out there. It seemed to glow sporadically on one side.  The lights went from bright white, to a greenish and a very faint orange.  I observed it for about a minute but as we began our decent down through the clouds I lost sight of it.  I did not tell anybody, and I dont believe anybody on the northwest flight saw it (as they were asleep)  but I dont see how the pilots could miss it.  I was the observer, I'm a visual effects artist in motion pictures, and a follower of ufo's, crop circles and the paranormal.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Two bright Spherical shapes chasing each other at high speed;1999-08-20 23:00:00;3mins;Two bright Spherical shapes chasing each other at high speed I was flying into Minneapolis Saint Paul airport and we had started our descent. I was looking out of the left side of the aircraft when I noticed two bright spherical shapes chasing each other at high speed in a circle and then a figure of eight just below cloud level. They seemed to take turns in chasing each other. I thought at first it was a reflection from the plane but as the plane was flying I was having to look back to see them as the plane was flying away from them. They were much too fast and turning too quickly to be any kind of aircraft.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Light over minneapolis;2000-06-29 21:00:00;4 seconds;Light over minneapolis I was driving home from work at 9p.m. I peripherly saw a light so I looked up and what I saw was a round light  about a mile away similar to a shooting star that had entered earths atmosphere, but it did not break up, it stayed the same. It went down to the ground very fast. I estimate the altitude at about 5000 feet above ground level. It must have been going over a thousand miles per hour. I thought maybe it was a firework, being the july fourth weekend. However, I did not see any fireworks in the area before or after the sighting. To me, this was a ufo. It is possible that this is explainable, and not out of this world, but it traveled faster than anything manmade (airplane, etc.);44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
I seen an object in the sky, thought it was a balloon, but it was too large and too high, in five minutes it barely moved.;2004-08-19 13:00:00;5 Minutes;I seen an object in the sky, thought it was a balloon, but it was too large and too high, in five minutes it barely moved. On that day I was working at a company called Active Style located in Minneapolis on the North East Side. Company Address is 3300 Pacific Avenue. It's near Broadway and Washington in Minneapolis, roughly 3 Miles North out of Downtown Minneapolis. I went outside to the parking lot to have a cigarette. While outside I looked up and seen something that caught my eye. At first I thought it was a balloon that may have got away from the Minnesota State Fair as that was going on in St. Paul at the time. But as I watched it for a time, it was too shiny, and too large to be a balloon that one could hold onto and hope to remain on the ground. It was way up in the sky and very glimmery. It seemed almost stationary as I was out there for 5 minutes and it barely made it about 2 inches across the sky if you were to hold up your index finger and middle finger and look to the sky. Using that as a distance to measure, if possible. I just thought it weird and went back into work.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
White sphere viewed with naked eye and telescope in broad daylight was most likely a high altitude balloon;2004-08-19 15:30:00;approx 2 hrs;White sphere viewed with naked eye and telescope in broad daylight was most likely a high altitude balloon A white sphere was reported on local radio to be moving against the wind above the city, despite relatively brisk winds from the west.  I observed a very small silver sphere to the east northeast at approximately 80 degrees from the horizon. The object was moving very very slowly to the southwest. The sky was clear and visiblilty was excellent from south Minneapolis. The object reflected sunlight and was not luminous. Observation of the object under 150x magnification with a refracting astronomical telescope revealed it to be a very high altitude balloon of significant size.  It was seen to slowly deform and show tension lines which shifted as it returned to its original shape.  No instrument pakage was visible.  Consultations with meterologists at the University of Minnesota confirmed that every observation I made was consistent with the behavior of a very high altitude balloon (+50000 feet), where it would not be affected by lower altitude winds, explaining its anomalous behavior in seeming to move against the prevailing wind. ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports of the same object.  The object has yet to be identified by law enforcement, the FAA, the National Weather Service, or local media outlets.  We do not know what caused the sighting.  PD));44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Two spheres flying in tight formation near Ford Parkway bridge;2006-06-18 15:00:00;1 minute;Two spheres flying in tight formation near Ford Parkway bridge On June 16th 2006, my wife and I were sitting outdoors at a café, the clouds looked particularly interesting that day, and as I often photograph them for my projects, I asked her if she minded us making a quick stop at the Ford Parkway bridge. This bridge provides an excellent panoramic view of the sky, perfect for capturing images of clouds.  I considered stopping at home first, to grab my Nikon D50, but I could tell I was testing my wife’s patience as it was. To my everlasting regret, we proceeded with my cheap digital camera that I kept in my car.  We got to the bridge and I walked out to the center of the bridge and took about 20 some pictures. The sky was partly cloudy (25% cloud cover?) but mostly blue sky.  When I finished, I walked back to the other end of the bridge where my wife stood waiting. As I talked to her I noticed two grey spheres flying toward us from the East in tight formation, the one nearest us just above the other.  They flew at a constant speed and trajectory from East to West. I was so excited I forgot that I had a camera in my hand. I kept asking if my wife could see them, but she could not. By the time I finally got my composure, the objects had begun to pass behind an apartment complex in front of us. Unfortunately the next mistake I made was to switch my camera to the movie setting, not realizing that the resolution is so poor it would not pick up the objects. I took a short video which is completely useless.  I have seen many different aircraft in my 43 years on this planet, these objects defy conventional classification. They were not weather balloons, I have seen weather balloons. They were perfect spheres, metallic gray, but not too reflective.  I figured that the reason my wife did not see then was the glare. Despite the partial cloud cover that day, it was actually a very bright day, and I had polarized prescription shades on. As the objects passed through the sky the seemed light gray, as they passed in front of clouds they seemed darker. They disappeared on the Eastern horizon. From the time I spotted them to the time they reached the Eastern horizon was less then a minute.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Two orbs emitting no light moving together until one starts to circle the other then attach themseleves.;2011-11-10 20:30:00;1 minute;Two orbs emitting no light moving together until one starts to circle the other then attach themseleves. Me and a friend were on the roof of an office building 20 stories tall in downtown Minneapolis just talking and looking up at the surrounding skyscrapers when something caught the corner of my eye.   I seen what appeared to be two orbs or spheres that were side by side just floating along.  I thought maybe they were just balloons or something.  I took another look and realized just how far away they were and then one started to circle the other in a clockwise motion.  After circling a few times they seemed to attach themselves to one another and we just watched until we could no longer see them.  These objects did not emit light and I believe the only reason we could see them was because of the city lights and the full moon.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Two objects near downtown Minneapolis, a third comes to call them away.;2012-07-31 20:00:00;5 minutes;Two objects near downtown Minneapolis, a third comes to call them away. I was on the rooftop bar of The Solara, a resturant in downtown Minneapolis, MN, with my entire family one evening.  We were sitting at a round table, I was facing out toward the city, and I could see most of the towers in the city.  I was visiting with my family and looking out at the buildings, when I saw a yellow/gold object kind of glide out from behind the tower I was looking at. The way it moved almost looked like it was floating on water or something as it came in and out of view from behind this skyscraper.  Just really smooth hovering, gliding, deliberate motion.  It was coming out from the left side of the building and going back behind it.  It never crossed to the other visible side of the building kept coming out the left side.  It did this over and over for a minute. The distance was a mile away I would guess.  It did not look very large.  This object did this for a couple minutes until another object came into view.  Almost looked like it appeared, or went from very small to visible, or like it came from far away into view to look just like the first one my family and I have been watching now for a few  minutes. Remind you, this rooftop was completely full, but I didn’t see anyone else looking at it, but we were.  The two objects stayed for another 30 seconds or so, kind of hovered around a bit until a 3rd object came down, almost like it was telling the other 2 to come back. I saw all three there for about 8 seconds, the third a bit smaller because it was further away, until all three took off.  When they took off they got smaller and smaller like they flew away very, very quickly.  They didn’t just disappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Moving red spheres in sky.;2013-07-04 21:54:00;5 minutes;Moving red spheres in sky My boyfriend and I were walking around the neighborhood looking for fireworks when we spotted red balls of lights in the sky. We knew they weren't fireworks because the lights didn't fade out.  They seemed to be moving in batches.  At first we saw about 3 or 4 moving separately across the sky, much faster and swifter than an airplane moves.  Then one by one they would disappear into the sky.  I'm not sure of the exact direction they were going, but I can verify that these lights were moving horizontally across the sky, like the same way a plane would...only much faster.  We then saw a few other groups. All of the moving lights were spread pretty far apart, but appeared to be going in the same direction. I attempted to record one with my phone, but the quality isn't nearly as good as I would've liked it to be.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Pulsating light in the cloudy eastern sky.;2016-09-09 07:45:00;10 minutes;pulsating light in the cloudy eastern sky. 7:45am, high, dense clouds to the east of the city. Heading east on 50th St from the Edina/Minneapolis line while riding my motorcycle, I noticed the usual low flying air traffic over head.  As a plane passed overhead and out of my line of sight, I noticed a round, pulsating light in the distance.  It was backed by significant dark cloud cover, but didn’t seem to be moving.  I was able to watch it for about 2-3 minutes before it became obscured by trees. I rode on approaching the west side of the I-35 overpass, and came to a high, open spot giving me the opportunity to see the ball of pulsating light again. It hadn’t moved, changed size, or direction in the 3-5 minutes since I had seen it last.  I was able to watch for another minute or two, noticing again the pulsation as well as a lack of any discernable movement.  I decided to pull over and try to record it using my phone.  I made the first possible right immediately after the I-35W overpass.  This gave me a high vantage point with no obstructions or interference of visual contact with the object.  I briefly looked away to get my phone out, entered my code to unlock it, and selected the video option under the camera mode.  This whole process took less than 20 seconds.  By the time looked back up, the object was gone.  There were no signs or indications it had been there at all.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
