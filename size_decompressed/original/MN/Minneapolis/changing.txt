Dark object  seen in early morning sky , vanishes.;2001-03-15 06:38:00;2-3 minutes;Dark object  seen in early morning sky , vanishes. I was driving about 30 mph on a parkway on the very western edge of north Minneapolis.  I was driving south, the moon was still visible at about 45 degrees above the horizon to the southwest and the sun had not yet come above the horizon but it was light out.  A few degrees below the moon I saw a cigar shape, nearly black in color, with no lights. It seemed to be moving towards the west, it was hard to judge because I was in a moving car.  As I drove I lost sight of it several times because of curves in the road, trees, and having to look at the road. In the first instance of regaining sight of it, it seemed to have a more triangular shape but still no lights. It was moving very slowly, if at all, and seemed very high in the sky. As I passed a tree it vanished. I stopped for a minute or so, to try to find it again, I did not see it anywhere in the sky. It had acctually vanished in a split second. There were no planes or helicopters that I could see, either.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Odd lights in south Minneapolis.;2016-10-01 02:00:00;3 hours;Odd Lights in South Minneapolis. I am amazed I haven't heard any reports on this sighting this following morning.   I was out on my front porch last night at about 3 AM.  Clear sky, and I was admiring the stars.  I then noted a strange light in the Eastern sky.  Very difficult to describe.  It was multi-colored, red, white , blue.  The colors shifted, or pulsed.  It seemed to hover, but did make a very slow Southerly progression.   After viewing it for approximately a half hour, I went an woke my wife.  I didn't do this easily, but felt she would be upset if I told her what I'd observed and didn't let her know.  She was as awed as I was.  She grew up in Old Ford Town, which is the neighborhood of the old Wold Chamberlin Field, and right close to MSP.  So, obviously she is not new to seeing aircraft in the night sky.  Neither of us could explain what we were seeing.  We were watching with binoculars, and we could come up with no explanation for this sighting.  Obviously, not a plane, nor a helicopter.  We watched until almost 5:00 AM.  Any other reports?  We'd love an explanation.  We were never freaked, but very intrigued.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
