Long rectangular vertical shaped object with several bright white strobbing lights;2004-02-12 20:40:00;4 minutes;Long rectangular vertical shaped object with several bright white strobbing lights My business partner and I went to our east facing window after seeing some flashing lights out of the corner of our eyes.  When we went to the window we saw a Long skinny Rectangular shape(roughly 100 feet above us), it was VERTICAL, roughly 15 feet in length, with several(maybe 6 or more)lights on it. The lights were all a very bright white and they were flashing and strobing. The light would start on the bottom and was strobbing and getting progressively brighter as it went up. Then it would repeat this. It made no noise. It looked like a floating rectangle. We watched it strob and flash as it flew off to the east horizon.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

Rectangular prism hanging over Minneapolis vanishes after 1 minute duration;2016-11-19 13:00:00;1 minute;Rectangular prism hanging over Minneapolis vanishes after 1 minute duration I saw a similar object as the other reporter for this date, but my view was much closer, so I really got a good look at it.   It was early afternoon and I was driving in Minneapolis.  The object was in a northerly direction.  I saw a very large rectangular prism just hanging there in the sky.  It was just beyond the tree line, the tree line about 4 city blocks away.  It looked like it was hanging over the city's lakes area.   It was off-white in color with brown outlining the edges and outlining other rectangular shapes within the object outline.  Interesting detail, the off-white was dirty and dingy, like it was old and well used.  It didn't move, it just hung in the air.  It was close to the ground too.  Usually, when I think of UFO's, I imagine them like the movies high in the sky, flashing some lights, flying around, then speeding by, and disappearing. It did disappear, but not by speeding away.  It just vanished, it was there one second and gone the next. I discounted what I saw, I don't know why.  I don't want to be a conspiracy person maybe, sorry no offense intended.  Now, I don't know what I believe.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
