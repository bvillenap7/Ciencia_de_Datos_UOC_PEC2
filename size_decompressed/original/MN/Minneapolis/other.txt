Morphing Triangle;1997-09-16 19:00:00;1/2 minutes;Morphing Triangle It was abeautiful autumn day. I was sitting on a second story balcony of my then apartment which I shared with my then girlfriend.  The balcony faces west. Approximately at sunset or thereabouts.  The Sun was large, nearing but still above the horizon. Brilliant deep yellow and Orange in color.  Suddenly the Sun appeared to change in shape from it's known 'round' to a Triangular shape. At the same time the color changed from the yellow/orange to a silvery metallic color. The Triangle appeared and disappeared a number of times. This was if you were looking directly at a perfect triangle. It did not rotate, bank or otherwise indicate any motion laterally, vertically or otherwise. Just a perfect triangle where the sun had been. When it reappeared however the triangle was inverted, with the tip, or point at the bottom. This disappearance and reappearance happened approximately 2 or 3 times. Then as suddenly as it had appeared, it was gone and the Sun was back as though nothing had happened. There was no disturbance or change to the emitted light in the sky. There was no sound associated with this occurance. The distance to the observed object 'Triangle' is impossible to say due to it's apparent morphing with the Sun. I had called for my girlfriend to hurry and come see what I was seeing but she wasn't interested and so did not witness. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

Only certain dots would move, some moved suddenly quite quickly.  Orginaly looked like stars.  three dots were about three times as large as the rest.  Originally they were in one long climbing line, but they grouped together.  A large stratus cloud had just recently passed by, moveing quite slowly to the south, (I was positioned to the east of the city the dots were just south of the city, almost above it.)  Behind the white dots was blue sky (sun was almost setting.  We suspect that they might have been ballons but they were floating in class B airspace.

Glowing green object crosses Twin Cities at low altitude;2006-10-04 22:45:00;5 Seconds;Glowing green object crosses Twin Cities at low altitude I was driving home alone on westbound highway 36 in Roseville MN.  It was about 10:45 pm and I had just passed the Rosedale shopping mall when I glanced out the side window of my car.  I saw a craft emitting pale green light moving very quickly through the low clouds.  It was flying from east to west, toward downtown Minneapolis.  I watched it glide through the sky for a moment, but then I had to look back at the road to make a curve.  When I tried again to look for the light, it was gone.  Because of the low clouds, I could not fully make out what the object was.  At first I thought it was a small plane, but it instantly struck me as different because it did not behave like a plane.  Its pale green light was steady, not blinking.  And it was moving at a low altitude so quickly and steadily, in an impossibly-perfect straight line.  I have never seen any plane do like this.  And about 30 seconds after I saw this, my 17 year old nephew called me from St Paul MN on my cellular phone to tell me that he had just seen a UFO.  He described exactly what I had just seen--only he had gotten a better look at it.  He was sitting outside on his front step in St Paul, and the craft crossed the sky at low altitude, from east to west.  He saw the same pale green light passing in and out of the low clouds.  But he got a good look at the craft -- it was triangular shaped, like an arrowhead.  And the pale green light was coming from lights along the edges that were long, more like fluorescent light tubes than like bulbs that you would see on a plane.  And the craft was perfectly silent.  I believe my nephew and I saw the same craft, from vantage points about 10 miles apart, as it crossed the Twin Cities from St Paul to Minneapolis at low altitude.

In the western sky, south of the Big Dipper, a star (unknown) had a spot flashing every few seconds around it.  First it was on the left, then up top, then on the right.  We were only there for a few minutes, but it continued for 1/2 hour on our walk home.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Report.;2011-07-03 03:00:00;unkown;Report   I called about a month ago to report what appeared to be three strange lights visible in the night sky that myself and a few neighbors noticed at about 3 am for a few nights consecutively.  I could make out three lights in what i would say were in a formation with the center light blinking rapidly.   It was obvious to me that these lights did not originate from any aircraft known to me i automatically called 911 and was told there were other confirmed reports of these lights as well as my own report.   It has been a month now and i have experienced lapses in time between the hours of 3 am onward and after a few strange dreams i woke up with a numbness in my right hand.  This IS NOT an attempt to hoax.   I am very frightened to have discovered an object about a half centimeter underneath the skin of my right thumb (second knuckle) and i have no recollection of having ever noticed it before.  I dont know what to make of it.   I am going to go to a hospital to arrange for it to be removed.  The object is dark and from what i can see about the size of an apple seed.   I can see it because of its dark color and closeness to the surface of my skin but it is an object that I can feel by pushing down on the area.   I dont know what this is but it was never there before all of these strange incidents began to occur.   I have not seen the lights since my last report;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
V-shaped stealth aircraft;2012-09-21 20:25:00;6 minutes;V shaped stealth aircraft The aircraft had 4 lights, one in the apex of the V shape and the other on the front and side wings. It was moving slowly and then turned abruptly, you could not hear anything, so it was in stealth mode or using some sort of quiet engine.  After turning it flew in the same direction and eventually the lights went out and we lost sight of it.  The craft itself looked metallic grey and the light in the apex was red while the other ones were regular light.  I could make out the V shape because there was nothing connecting the wings together which is why I found it odd in the first place.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Silent v-shaped objects with dim blue lights flew north over downtown Minneapolis;2013-04-27 23:00:00;20 seconds;Silent v-shaped objects with dim blue lights flew north over downtown Minneapolis My boyfriend and I were laying on the Gold Medal Park hill gazing at the sky, when he suddenly pointed out a white banner flying silently in the sky over the eastern side of downtown Minneapolis.  It was partially invisible, and had a weird hazy glow.  You could almost describe it as a kite-looking object. About 5 minutes later, my boyfriend and I saw a triangle of lights, two red and one yellow, flying in a half circle before disappearing. The last sighting, I, along with people atop of the hill, saw another v-shaped object. It was closer, much larger, black in color, and had numerous small, very dim, and blue lights on the bottom of it.  Still, it was silent, and moved in ways different than a jet plane.  It, too, was flying north on the eastern side, right over the Mill Ruins and the Mississippi River.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

I was standing near the corner of Washington and Oak St in Minneapolis, MN and noticed a long perfectly straight beam of like about 50m;2013-12-31 17:30:00;15 minutes;I was standing near the corner of Washington and Oak St in Minneapolis, MN, and noticed a long perfectly straight beam of like about 50m long just above the bottom of the cloud cover.  There happened to be a spotlight from a local business circling the night sky and whenever the spotlight passed across the beam of light there was, what looked like, a reflected pulse of light bouncing off perpendicular to the light beam.   See linked video, this happens at about the 10 second mark (sorry for the background noise, I was waiting at the bus stop).   I watched this for a good 10 mins and the object didn't move, and each time the spotlight passed over it I saw the reflected light. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1VabPXMI1Q_aFNGLTBRZzVZeDA/edit?usp=sharing ((NUFORC Note:;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308

White, illuminating ring around 3-4 blocks in circumference.;2015-08-09 22:00:00;60-90 minutes;White, illuminating ring around 3-4 blocks in circumference. On August 9th, 2015, around 10pm, I went out onto my balcony with my boyfriend.  We sat down and we were having a conversation when he told me to check out the ring of light off to the south. I looked over and saw what he was talking about.  At first I thought that some business must be projecting lights into the sky to draw attention. When I said that to him, he said, “Just look at it.  If it was a business projecting that light, wouldn’t you be able to see the beams coming from below?”   I sat there for a moment and watched this ring. I looked over at my boyfriend and asked him if he thought that the ring seemed to be moving closer to us.  He agreed with me.  As we sat and watched this ring, I noticed that it seemed to be illuminating from inside the ring.  I went in and got my phone so I could take a photo and hope to capture the light.  I came back out and started to take photos.  Unfortunately, the photos do not show the enormity and brightness of this ring.   I live close to an airport, and was able to take a photo of a plane flying near this illuminating ring.  The longer I sat and looked at the ring, the more I convinced myself that there had to be a logical explanation for it.  This ring of light lasted for more than an hour and I am still shaking my head trying to figure out what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected advertising lights at a local casino.

Unknown object that flies above us, below the clouds,  bright, sunny day. Travels quickly,  then disappears.;2019-06-16 13:33:00;<1 minute;Unknown object that flies above us, below the clouds,  bright, sunny day. Travels quickly,  then disappears. Good afternoon, June 16th, my mother called me quickly to come see something strange in the sky.  She quoted seeing antennas on some craft.  I went outside to see this amazing object traveling at an angle.  Like it wasn't vertical,  or horizontal, it was quite strange.  It was long in width (by the way it was traveling).  I believe I also saw some form of sphere in the middle.  I really hope they can share my photo on the web. As it passed above us,  below the clouds, nice sunny day.  I took out my phone and happen to take a one second video! I have an image of what we saw.  I'm excited and share the photo with my close relatives to tell me, what I saw. The object traveled quickly,  and made no sound.  At one point I thought maybe that's an eagle.  I'm not far from the river.  But it did disappear.  If I didn't have this picture, I'd be wondering my entire life.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
