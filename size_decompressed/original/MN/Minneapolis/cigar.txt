Red/Fiery object (or plane) in sky Loud humming noise.;2016-06-23 20:30:00;2 minutes;Red/Fiery object (or plane) in sky Loud humming noise. Red/orange-plane/cigar shaped craft moving at the speed of an airplane.  Cruising high in the sky before sunset against a clear blue sky.  It was very shiny, almost like it was on fire, though its color was consistent and didn't seem to flash or go 'out of shape'.  Initially thought it was a plane, but seemed to bright and high up to be a plane.  There were no con trails trailing the plane that were visible.  Couldn't make out any specific details on the plane itself, but it was flying South to East and was visible for approximately 3 minutes.  Additionally, there was a loud humming/high pitched noise approx. 10-20 minutes after viewing the plane, which lasted about 2 minutes and seemed to come from no specific direction.  Not sure if the incidences were related, but the plane like object itself didn't seem to make any noise at the time, though it was very high up.  Just wanted to report this incase anyone else has seen this.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
Interesting sighting over Uptown Minneapolis.;2017-01-19 02:28:00;30 minutes;Interesting sighting over Uptown Minneapolis. One craft with two bright lights.  Seemed to hover in one area until it finally shot straight up a disappeared from sight.  Thought it could of been a drone or helicopter by the way it was behaving until it went straight up a faster then any craft I could imagine.;44.9841638952689;-93.3006350482308
