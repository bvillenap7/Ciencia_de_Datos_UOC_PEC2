Orange saucer shaped stationary object hung in the sky like a fixed object.;2005-11-02 00:00:00;2 minutes;Orange saucer shaped stationary object hung in the sky like a fixed object. I was facing perfectly north from the back of my apartment complex parking lot, I cannot judge distance or be sure of the height in which I saw the following. I can only refer to my state of mind at the time as 100% calm but in awe. I was in awe that I was seeing an object so obviously not an airplane or other conventional craft. I have lived within 5 miles of the Mpls/St.Paul airport for all of my 38 years and have seen countless aircraft, even a Stealth Bomber once.  This craft was basically oval in shape. The whole thing was emitting a pale orange, yellow glow.  It was perfectly still and completely silent.  It looked like a fixed object in the sky. I could not see any metal or anything indicative of what the craft was made of. The entire shape was of the glow aforementioned surrounded by some measure of haze or fog. I was not aware of it having moved at the time that I was watching it.  The duration of the sighting lasted about 2 minutes.  It was only after I left the area to catch my bus in order to get to work on time, (of all things!), that I realized it must have moved quite drastically from its original position as for the last 30 seconds or so of the sighting my neck was craned upward quite a bit and the object turned into a much smaller orange light basically round or ovoid in shape ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.8769;-93.2535
