Orange Light traveling SE-NW over Richfield, MN.;2012-07-15 22:50:00;1 minute;Orange Light traveling SE-NW over Richfield, MN. Orange Light similar to Sodium-Vapor Lamp seen flying straight-line across sky at speed similar to small aircraft or helicopter.  Observed from NE corner of Richfield MN, flying in a NW-ly direction from approx 90 degrees of observer viewpoint to approx 350 degrees of observer viewpoint.  No sudden speed changes or direction changes.  Observer opened house window to listen for sound, but no noticeable sound observed.  Observed close to MSP airport, but light would have traveled from the SE to the NW of the airfield with no change in altitude.  Observer transferred from E facing to N facing window of house as it passed over, but lost track momentarily before picking it up as a faint but disappearing light traveling to the NW.  Seemed as if it could have been illuminated by the sun (which had set) perhaps as a result of very high altitude, since the illumination only appeared to emanate from the W facing side.  Brightness similar to sodium vapor streetlights 1! /2 block away.;44.8769;-93.2535
