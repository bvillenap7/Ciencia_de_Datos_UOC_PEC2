Triangular light formation, tree top height above my head in Aitkin Mn;2002-08-10 22:45:00;10 sec.;Triangular light formation, tree top height above my head in Aitkin Mn That night my sister was spending the night, with my wife and I. They were in the house and I was on the deck, looking up at the stars.  The kids were asleep and the sky was clear.  No more than 5 mins. had gone by when from over the house, just above the tree tops three white, brite lights forming a narrow triangle flew above my head.  I could see no body attached to them.  They were pointed straight ahead like car lights.  If there would have been a craft attached to the lights I would have been able to see it.  After all, it was so low to the ground if I would have had a rock I would have been able to hit it easily.  They flew straight accross the field and over the tree line.  The speed was to slow for an airplane, but fast enough where their should have been some wind sound, there wasn't even sound from an engine. I watched it most of the way accross the field.  My wife and sister could not have made it out in time to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));46.4856;-93.6506
