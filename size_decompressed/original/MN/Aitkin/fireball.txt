One large fireball about half the size of a hot air balloon.  It was moving about 20 miles an hour. We were facing north.  It was moving west in a straight line, following right above the tree line. It was dome shaped with an orange aluminous glow and had a yellowish aura around it. I got up and went on the dock with my flashlight and shined it. It stopped and shrunk itself and went west up in the sky at a 90 degree angle.  Our lake is about 5 or 6 city blocks across.  There were light clouds passing with visible stars. It was amazing.  This is the third time me and my husband had a sighting. I am a 45 year old mother of 3 girls and work in a hospital.  My husband is 40 years old and is a driver for a big mechanical co.  My daughter is 10 and a great student.  One of our neighbors is a 53 year old female and works for a bank securing loans.  Our other neighbor is a 15 year old female and also an excellent student. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));46.4856;-93.6506
