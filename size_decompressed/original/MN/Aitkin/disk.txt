Disk hovering near Farm Island Lake;2019-07-26 22:00:00;~1 hour;Disk hovering near Farm Island Lake Over Farm Island Lake, I witnessed a disk with lights hovering, seeming to stay in one place but over the course of the hour it moved slightly west.  It had a slight bobbing motion and side to side zip, this was very slight. I thought it was an aircraft and couldn’t understand why a plane did not move ima trajectory in the sky.  I watched it for what I believe was an hour and then it was gone.  It had three lights in a line parallel to the ground.  This is my first sighting of a craft that I couldn’t decipher.;46.4856;-93.6506
