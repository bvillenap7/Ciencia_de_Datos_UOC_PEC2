Lasted about 15 seconds and it disappeared before my eyes. I was driving home later at night.  Full moon in the front of my windshield when a light shined on me from a little behind my drivers window.  Expecting to be pulled over i looked over for my eyes to meet a large oval object hovering about 75ft away about 100ft up.  Very large.  Shined on me and didn't move for about 15 seconds.  Disappeared leaving light stains in my eyes.  Unsure if time was lost.;46.4856;-93.6506
