Tonight at 9:28 pm, my daughter and I were traveling north on Maple Grove Road in Pine City, MN, and seen a pretty large craft in the north sky with 3-4 bright golden lights and it seemed to be hovering in one spot.  There was no sound at all and then appeared to be going very fast across the sky to the east.  Then it went under the light layer of clouds, we were able to watch this for about 5-6 minutes before it disappeared.  We then drove back to Cherry road (runs east and west) we drove east on Cherry Road and looked to the north east sky above the tree line and seen the craft with golden color lights hovering above the trees line (similar in height of a cell phone tower)   The craft was now moving to the south we watched this for about 3-4 minutes then the craft shape shifted to a larger object similar how it looked few minutes earlier with the golden lights it looked like it shape shifted to a long row of lights and the golden lights became 2 red lights and! they blinked and disappeared.  During both times there was no sound and it was above the tree lines just hovering there before it moved and disappeared.  Ended at 9:43pm;45.8393;-92.9124
