UFO close up and possible ET encounter;2007-05-01 17:00:00;3 minutes;UFO close up and possible ET encounter My best friend and I were walking to his house on a trail and I pointed out this massive lights on the inside of a large cloud to our left.  A large UFO pushed through the clouds and was slowly going directly over me as my friend ran and hid he was yelling at me to get out of there.   It was extremely detailed circle shaped object with lights zipping all over the underneath in patterns and in the center was a bright red circle light that also emitted a faint red glow down in a beam type shape.  The red center beam had a capsule shaped container looking object that slowly descended from the craft, but as it descended it also seemed to fade away out of sight.   I seem to remember it had a sort of slight rumbling sound to it but my friend thought it was silent.  I just stood there in shock and fixated on the immense size and detail of this craft.  I can't say how large it was but I just remember it was directly over me and as I looked up it took up all of my vision of the sky.   I don't remember watching it leave and my friend does not either.  We both don't understand how we could be so fixated on watching this object then not even bother to watch it go away.   Next thing we knew we were walking back on the trail and immediately from the woods I heard these loud sounds which sounded like heavy equipment digging and then I heard distinct leaping and landing stomp sounds through the brush.   Suddenly these two red glowing eyes were staring right at us on the edge of the woods in thick brush and we heard a growl that we both have never heard anything like this before.  It was the most terrifying growl I have ever heard (like something from a movie we both described it.) and we both immediately ran down the trail away from this creature.
