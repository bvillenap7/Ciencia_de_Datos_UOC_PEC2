Large unexplainable rectangular, clear-shaped form seen in night sky;2011-04-21 00:00:00;10 seconds;Large unexplainable rectangular, clear-shaped form seen in night sky Me, my sister, and her friend had just stepped outside, around midnight, on the front porch.  We were facing north, just talking amongst each other and looking around for no particular reason.  All of a sudden I gazed towards the lower part of the north-eastern sky and I saw this huge (I say huge because it was far bigger and wider than the tiny dots called stars) rectangular shaped, faintly white & opaque in color, sort of mist-like/phantom-like thing drift quickly downwards before it disappeared. As it drifted downwards, it was like some of the form still stayed in the original spot but changed as it moved. Like pulling on a piece of laffy taffy..  I'm not exaggerating when I say that this all happened in less than 10 seconds.  As soon as I saw it, I said, Oh my God. What is that?.   My sister caught the last glimpse of it floating downward before it disappeared but her friend didn't see it (that's why I say there were 2 witnesses - me & my sister).  Later when I described to my whole family about what we saw, she agreed with me about what it looked like.   I'm still at a loss of words as to what this was..  What amazes me is the size of it and how it had this clear/see-through look to it.  I've never seen anything like it but I had to report this in the hopes that at least someone else out there has seen anything like it.;44.5689;-95.0233
