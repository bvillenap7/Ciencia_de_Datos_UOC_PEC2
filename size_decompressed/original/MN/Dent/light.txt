A BRIGHT light, such as landing lights on a commerical jet approaching at a distance of several  miles, plus red and green flashing lights. Stayed in one location for quite a time, and then moved higher and lower a bit (jerking movements up, down and to the south,   and then over about 2 hours gradually moved to the southwest and higher and eventually it became nearer, and then dawn came and we could no longer view it.  There is no commerical airport within over 75 miles of here - and we NEVER see any landing lights here -- also, we have never seen landing lights with the interposed flashing red and green lights.
