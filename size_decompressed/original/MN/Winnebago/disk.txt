Not really believing him I went in and looked thinking he was foolish as well as my 15 yr. old foster son . We saw at first a bright light and then as we watched it , it began to change colors in a circler motion .The lights went around the craft changing from white , to green to red and blue .  It hovered for the longest time and then it began to come a little closer . I got the binaculars and looked and I could see the shape . It was shape in a disk shape or like what you would see in the alien shows . The coolest part was that we were able to see what appeared to be windows all along the top half of the craft. The U.F.O Stayed around for about 1 1/2 hrs .  We saw it again on 01/03/03 and my 21 yr. old daughter saw it to , we have been watching for it tonight but haven't seen anything as of yet .
