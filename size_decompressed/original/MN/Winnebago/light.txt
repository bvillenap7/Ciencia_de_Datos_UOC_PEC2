Small green light in southern Minnesota sky.;2018-07-08 18:45:00;4 seconds;Small green light in southern Minnesota sky. A small green light moving west to east in the southern sky.  The green light had a white trail 10 times the length of the greean ball of light. It covered my complete field of view in 4 seconds nearly perfectly horizontal in its trajectory.  Size was very dificult to determine.  My best guess would be it was 10 miles south of Winnebago and at roughly 3,000 ft. I have seen meteors and this was distinctly a green light about the size of a M&M in the sky.  Given its small size if it had been a manned craft it would have been traveling at a speed I have never wittnessed.  I have also seen fighter jets from 1 to 10 miles away and this was faster than any jet. I have never seen something like this before and was startled enough to find somewhere to report it.;43.7703;-94.1602
