It moved across 60 degrees of the sky approximately, then disappeared. On the above date and time, me and my friend were taking a walk along an unlit street near where I live.  My friend pointed and told me to look over my left shoulder, in the east. I saw a bright light about the size of a dime at arms length, the light was a blueish white color, it was moving fairly quickly across the sky, but there was plenty of time for me to turn my head and see it for about 10 or 20 seconds, the light moved from the northeast to the southeast in an arcing path, which led me to believe it was far away. Before the object reached the horizon it disappeared. We heard no noise. I do not believe this was a shooting star because it was way to big, it was constant, and it lasted too long.;45.1832;-92.9466
