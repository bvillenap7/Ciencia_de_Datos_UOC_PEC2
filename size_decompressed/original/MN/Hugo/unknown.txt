On June 15th,  2013 around 9pm in Hugo Minnesota a few of us witnessed the following: We were having a bonfire on my friendâ€™s 7 acres of farmland.  Our backgrounds range from behavior therapist to self-employed professional painter to landscaper to vet. From the south 3 crafts appeared above the tree horizon with blinking lights. The lights went from blinking to a solid orange light directed at us though no light was visible on our bodies.  After about 10 seconds they all turned to blinking lights again and one moved east around us and one moved west around us and one moved directly over us.  No specific shape of craft could be detected as they were too far up. When all 3 were in line with us above and to the east and west they stopped moving completely and waited.  Then another 3 appeared and did the exact same thing while the original 3 moved towards the north of us.  Then another 3 appeared and did the exact same thing. We saw 9 total crafts at the same time surrounding us in the sky.  Multiple times they would stop and shift directions individually at times and in unison at times.  All 9 eventually moved north out of sight, never shooting off fast but keeping a steady speed and distance. The whole event lasted maybe 17-20 minutes.
