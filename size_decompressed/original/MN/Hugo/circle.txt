Orange orbs in the sky, rotating around each other in Hugo, Minnesota.;2014-12-20 19:00:00;10 minutes;Orange orbs in the sky, rotating around each other in Hugo, Minnesota. Specific location from which the event was observed:  Latitude 45.152246 Longitude -92.930474   While driving north on the ~13600 block of Isleton Avenue, I noticed 3 bright orange/yellow orbs suspended along the northern treeline. As I and the motorist behind me both pulled over to witness the event, another 4 orbs appeared, and the orbs began to move around each other in the form of a spiral, or double helix.  One orb remained stationary during this time. We observed the event for about 5 minutes after pulling over.  All of the orbs faded away into the night sky, while the stationary object stayed for another 5 minutes. This stationary object then vanished from sight quite rapidly. I filmed the event via cellphone from my car during the initial 30 seconds of the sighting, then for another minute while I watched with the other motorist. I have the two short videos in .mp4 format if you would like them. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and he seemed to us to be sincere and sober-minded.  We will request a copy of the video.  PD));45.1832;-92.9466
