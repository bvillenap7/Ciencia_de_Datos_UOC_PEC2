On Sunday evening, May 16, 2010, at approximately 9:30 p.m., my wife and I spotted 2 bright lights in the northern sky, over northern  Hugo or southern Forest Lake, Minnesota.  The lights were pentagonal in shape and were red with yellow and orange appearing occasionally.  They traveled slowly from east to west before stopping over what might have been interstate I-35 for a minute or two.   Then they moved north at a rapid speed, judging for reduction in size of the lights.  Once far away, each on simply disappeared.;45.1832;-92.9466

Was in my view for a good minute and moved a short distance south than slowly dimmed into a tiny speck that looked like a normal star.   Happened around 9:15pm.;45.1832;-92.9466
