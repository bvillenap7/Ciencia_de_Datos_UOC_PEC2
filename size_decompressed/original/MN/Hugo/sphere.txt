My brother and I were standing on my balcony when two red, glowing spheres floated from behind the trees. They were varying their speed and stopping to hover at times. The first sphere sped up and moved ahead of the second sphere.  The first sphere then stopped and hovered while the second sphere increased its speed and caught up. Once the second sphere caught up to the first it stopped and hovered.  Then the first sphere shot nearly vertical at an incredible speed until it disappeared into space roughly 8 seconds later.  At that time the second sphere followed with same trajectory and disappeared into space.;45.1832;-92.9466
