Pulsated colored lights brightening and diming in the sky without movement;2021-06-02 23:00:00;24 mins or so;Pulsated colored lights brightening and diming in the sky without movement I was getting ready to close the bedroom window in my 3rd floor apartment and I saw what I thought was a plane with its headlights on. But the object was not moving. It had 3 lights closely together changing colors between white, red, and a greenish blue color in the clear night sky. I could not tell if it was more than one object. The pulsated lights were brightening and dimming in no pattern. This phenomenon went on for almost 30 mins with no movement the entire time and just like that it stop.  I tired to record it with my phone, but it just was not clear.;45.126952112676;-93.4540281690141
