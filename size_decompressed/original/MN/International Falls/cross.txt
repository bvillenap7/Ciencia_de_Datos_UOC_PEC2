As I got to my foyer I looked out my front door and saw what I appeared to be an airplane with its landing lights on. I watched it for about 30 seconds and at that point told myself that this did not appear to be an airplane due to how the lights looked now. So I decided to get my jacket on and just step outside for a momement. Now looking at this object I knew by seeing the lights moving across it and what appeared to be some kind of red laser type of light on the bottom, that looked like it was hanging quite someway away from the lights on top, that this was something that I have never seen before. I observed this for approx. 45 min. At times the lights appeared to be in a cross shape but most of the time it was just straight across with the red light on the bottom. This red light appeared to be going in a circular motion and just not oneway, in some kind of scanning mot! ion back and forth. The light that appeared from this object was white and sometimes blue lights running through the white. There were times that both ends of the light were lit up in blue also. I know this seems crazy but I truly know what I saw and maybe there is an answer. I don't know but I thought I would at least document this sighting with the first hit I got on the internet.;48.6029;-93.4106
