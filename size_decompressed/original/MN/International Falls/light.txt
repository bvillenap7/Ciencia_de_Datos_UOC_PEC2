Lights (on craft) moving in extremely rapid zig-zags through the night sky.;2006-08-01 03:00:00;3 minutes;Lights (on craft) moving in extremely rapid zig-zags through the night sky. I saw a single craft following the Rainy River, then veering off to the south. It was zig-zagging very rapidly, in a way that no normal aircraft could have done. I woke up my husband who also saw it. We could not see the shape of the craft itself, just red, green, white light and its unusual movement. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
