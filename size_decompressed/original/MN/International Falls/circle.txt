round ball that looked like fire with flashing bottom falling out of the sky.;2010-10-28 22:00:00;5 seconds;round ball that looked like fire with flashing bottom falling out of the sky. I was driving around town with my friend in International Falls, Minnesota and we both suddenly saw a orange sphere fall from the sky.  It made it from the sky to the tree area in about 5 seconds. It looked like a ball of fire but the bottom of it was flashing.  All it really did was fall from the sky we sort of looked for it but couldn't find anything so it must have went into a field or something.  It also made a loud noise like a airplane would for just a second until it reached ground area.;48.6029;-93.4106
