On Saturday night, May 6th, 2006 at approximately 23:45, my two adult son's and I observed an unusual object moving accros the sky.  We were standing outside in an area devoid of light so that the evening sky was clear.  We were in Winona, Minnesota.  It was a beautiful night without a cloud in the sky. A loose formation of 4 points of white light traveling from East to West were observed.  The 4 points of light were of equal intensity, remaining constant at about the brightness level of a bright star.  The 4 objects were separate, moving independantly from one another, seaminly to dart about in a loose formation, all traveling together.  As we stood near a tall industrial building, the objects were seen as they came over the roof of the building and then disapeared about 5 seconds later. The most unusual thing about the objects was the area around and in-between them.  The space around and between the objects of the formation seamed to ripple as though the light from starts in the background was being distorted.  It was like a large bubble of water traveling across the sky, distorting the light, we could clearly see through it but distorted and rippling. There was absolutly no sound, silent.  Our first impression was that the objects were close.  It then appeared that the objects were at very high altitude (or maybe not even flying near the earth) traveling at a very high rate of speed.  Then, as the objects flew to a point about 90 degrees from the initial sighting, they just vanished. I'm 60 years old and have seen many strange things in life, but Ive never seen anything like this before.;44.0286;-91.6957000000002
