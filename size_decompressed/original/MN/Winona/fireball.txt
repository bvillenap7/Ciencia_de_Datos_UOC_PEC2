Two firie orange/red balls of flame floating and hovering, faint outline of triangular shape just under and out from firie shaped ball;2013-04-13 23:30:00;8 minutes;Two firie orange/red balls of flame floating and hovering, faint outline of triangular shape just under and out from firie shaped ball There were two orange/red balls of flame and they seemed to just float around the night sky very slowly.  There was no wind and no sound at all.  They seemed so close at times and at times i could see an outline under the flame looking balls.  The outline kind of looked like three giant sized fans conected together in a triangular pattern and facing downwards with the firie ball part just above one triangle end. they would move very close to each other and then apart again.  I ran downstairs to grab my video camera and when i came back up they were gone. we watched open eyed for a few mins and all of a sudden they rose up from behind this big tree on the opposite side of our block.  OMG they were closer than ever.  my mom was freaking and my daughter age 13 was in awe, she just kept asking what are they.  I got some video, the best i could with what i have.  You cant see the faint outline that i was describing earlier but firie orange/red balls are pretty clear.  Definitely unexplainable to me.
