Five star like lights moving across the sky.;2012-08-18 22:30:00;20;five star like lights moving across the sky. the five of us were sitting around a bonfire at about 10:30 when one of us noticed a light that aPpeared to be a star but was moving at an irregular speed. it had no flashing lights just one bright light. it covered the whole sky, horizon to horizon in about one minute.   A minute or two went by and we saw another one. we saw a total of five of these same star like objects. the last one however was a bit more interesting. as it was almost out of sight, the light became brighter than any other star that was in the sky, then changed direction.   After we saw the last one we saw three planes flying at a very fast speed and the pilot in the group sugested that they were most likely government aircrafts. coincidence?  direction of flight on the last one was south to north, others were west to east or southwest to northeast.;45.6422;-95.3924
