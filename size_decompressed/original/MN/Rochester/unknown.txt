Streaking white dots;1978-08-15 13:00:00;30 minutes;Streaking white dots I was sunbathing in the mid-afternoon on the back deck of my family's home looking straight up into the blue sky. Suddenly I saw 3 or 4 white dots, in a straight line, streak across the sky from west to east. The streaking white dots appeared to be at very high altitude and moving incredibly fast. Within in one to two seconds they had crossed the sky. My first impression were that they were high flying jets. It was hard to comprehend...to cross the sky that high that fast. Then within 30 seconds, the event repeated. White dots streaking across the sky in a straight line, west to east. I continued to see white dots streak across the sky, in the same line of path, every 30 seconds or so. Now I thougt they must be satellites, but how could they circumnavigate the globe that fast to re-appear within 30 seconds? Just wondering what I saw? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source is anonymous.  Satellites do not circumnavigate the Earth in 30 seconds.  PD));44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
long row of lights with red light under, hovered, flew to west, dropped down below tree level, popped back up and flew faster than a nm;2007-01-30 22:10:00;5 minutes;long row of lights with red light under, hovered, flew to west, dropped down below tree level, popped back up and flew faster than a nm as my girlfriend and i (both 50+yrs) were driving home at 10:10 PM we saw a very bright light low in the sky, we turned on to the last road home and saw the light again as we were behind trees and farm houses for a mile or so. the light hadnt moved, it was stationary. then as we got closer the object was about the size of a quarter held at arms length, it started to move to the right slowly at first then very quickly until we couldnt see it, it had disappeared behind a line of trees which make up a huge woods. we continued driving for another mile and all of a sudden the light went straight up and started coming back towards us quickly. i pulled over and got out of the car to look at it. as it went by about 2 miles away i could see a long row of lights and one tiny red lid underneath.  it was VERY COLD (0 degrees) and WINDY but i managed to get a couple poor quality pics. it then slowly veered away from us and i drove as fast as i could to follow it. i could not keep up so i pulled over and got out of the car one more time and then heard a very loud roar which turned out to be a jet of some sort that flew righ over my car fairly low. it had all the running lights i would expect that blink. the object we saw had no blinking lights. the jet followed the same direction as the object but much higher and to the left of it. they both continued flying away from us until out of sight. i called the local airport, they were not interested but gave me the FAA number which i called and that lady was not too interested either. i offed to send the photos but she said dont bother and have a nice day.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
Black line over moon moves, then vanishes.;2011-01-22 21:35:00;3 minutes;Black line over moon moves, then vanishes. I was leaving work at about 9:35 on January 22, 2011 and was passing Wal-Mart South in Rochester, when I happened to look up at the moon, and noticed that the moon looked cut in half.  I closed my eyes a few time to make sure my sight wasnâ€™t going bad, but it was still there.  A solid, thick black line right over the middle of the almost full moon, with a light on it.   I drove a little ways, and when passing a field, I looked again, and the line had lowered to the bottom 2/3 of the moon.  I drove a little more, and when I looked again, the line had vanished.  There were no power lines in the area, nor overhead lines of any sort.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
