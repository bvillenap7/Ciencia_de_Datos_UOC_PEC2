A fleet of at least 100 disc shaped UFOs dancing across the sky!;2005-08-27 14:30:00;10 Minutes;A fleet of at least 100 disc shaped UFOs dancing across the sky! My husband and I were frying steaks on the deck- a sunny Saturday afternoon. I happened to look up and saw something off in the distance. As we watched it get closer, we realized that we were seeing, what I later found out, was a fleet of UFOs! At least 100 of them dancing across the sky silent,graceful- making all kinds of formations and designs. We continued to watch in awe for about ten minutes until they were were lost to our vision by trees blocking our view. They were a shiny, metalic, disc shape. About a minute later, a jet appeared and seemed be chasing the group. This event has puzzled us until this past week when we watched a program on the History Channel titled Mexico's Roswell. THERE THEY WERE!!! Footage of EXACTLY what we saw this past August. What do they want?!;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948

I went on my back porch and looked at the horizon and saw a black disk object flying in a straight line from left to right and then disappear.  After it dissapeared, I saw a burst of light in the daylight sky as if the craft went into hyperspace.   There had also been birds flying in the sky when I saw the craft.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
