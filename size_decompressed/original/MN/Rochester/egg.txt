a shiny saucer or egg shaped object in the sky at Walmart store;2011-02-10 07:28:00;30 seconds;a shiny saucer or egg shaped object in the sky at Walmart store I was waiting for a bus at a bus stop at Walmart South store at 25 25th St SE. the sky is clear and sun is up and shining. I was just looking at sky and there is nothing in the sky. sudden, I saw a bright star appeared in the sky, at first I thought it was a star, but I saw it moving down and I looked at it very hard.  I see that it was a metal-like object and the sun is reflecting on it. It was shaped like a saucer or egg. it just faded into the sky and disappeared after like 30 seconds. There is a airport 9 miles from the location I am at.  I know it was not a airplane.  here is a map where I was at and saw a UFO in the sky. http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=25+25th+Street+Southeast,+Rochester,+MN&aq=&sll=43.949822,-92.439651&sspn=0.183156,0.308647&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=25+25th+St+SE,+Rochester,+Olmsted,+Minnesota+55904&ll=43.98437,-92.455788&spn=0.011441,0.01929&t=h&z=16;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
