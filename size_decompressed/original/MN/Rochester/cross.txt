Five bright orange lights (cross shape upon closer inspection) hovering over Rochester, MN.;2013-01-04 23:15:00;5 minutes;Five bright orange lights (cross shape upon closer inspection) hovering over Rochester, MN I was driving on Villa Rd. in NW Rochseter,MN when I saw about 5 strange bright orange lights in the sky in a line going upwards.  Slowly, as I was driving, they started to disappear from top to bottom, but there were two remaining when I got to my house. and one when I went to my backyard to see it better.  It appeared to be in the shape of a cross up and down with a bright orange color.  I watched it move slowly and it appeared to have a little wake behind it and then it disappeared.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
