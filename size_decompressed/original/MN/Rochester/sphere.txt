I am a 26 year old female.  I was outside having a cigarette break watching the storm in my backyard. I love storms - the thunder, rain, lightning.  I just stare at the sky watching for lightning.  Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until I noticed the sky started to get brighter and bluer.   Just as I was thinking huh, that's weird, a blue ball of light soared over the clouds low over my backyard, from east to west.  I didn't know it was a ball of light until it went over a part of the sky where the clouds broke up.  Right after, there was lightning.  I tried to think it was just part of the lightning, but the object in question didn't flash, just glowing and passed over swiftly.  It didn't make any noise.  It had an aura about it, and emanated light all around it, but you could tell the shape was spherical.  I just sat there with my jaw dropped.  I kept trying to rationalize what it was.  I entertained the thought it was a meteor about to hit the earth, and sat there waiting for the ground to shake.  Nothing happened, though.  I stayed outside for 15-20 minutes waiting for something to happen as if to explain it.  I have no idea what it was that I saw.  I only know that it was an unidentified flying object.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
