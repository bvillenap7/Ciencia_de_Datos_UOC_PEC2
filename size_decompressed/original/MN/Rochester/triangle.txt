The craft hung in the sky without moving for a good 30 minutes. I followed the craft to the West for the next 15 minutes, when it sped up and headed for Hayfield.  This craft had a set of perimeter lights and two large red lights or lasers around the back of it. I would guess it to be aprox. 100 to 200 feet or more in width. It would also tip up a few degrees at times on one side (dip) All the lights would go off and on at times.  Airplanes came by from the Airport but nothing was reported in the local news. It was also observed by my wife and another car that stopped.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948

There were 3 red lights that formed into a triangle.  They were moving toward each other and eventually started to disappear one by one.  We were in downtown Rochester as the sun was almost done setting.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948

Huge, black, completely silent, slow gliding triangle. Cruised by close to the ground.;2014-03-09 19:40:00;1 minute;Huge, black, completely silent, slow gliding triangle. Cruised by close to the ground. Huge black triangle with large, white circular lights around the edges.  It was completely silent and was slowly gliding by.  This didn't seem right because the object was flying really low..about the height of a 5 story building.  Had to turn my head right to left to see the entirety of the craft.  I was in my car and made a turn to to follow it, only to see it hover down over a patch of trees where its lights began to dim then it completely vanished.

3 orange lights, forming a perfect triangle in the SW sky, without sound or motion.;2015-08-06 01:45:00;30 minutes;3 orange lights, forming a perfect triangle in the SW sky, without sound or motion. I witnessed 3 glowing orange to red orange orbs to the SW.  The 3 objects appeared to be independent of each other and oscillated at different intervals.  I could not discern the presence of an overlaying craft (these did not appear to be lights attached to a craft of any kind). The 3 orbs began  as a single light and progressed in short fashion (maybe 10 minutes) in to 3, presented to me in the form of a perfect triangle in the sky.  I did not see any apparent motion nor did I detect any sound resonating from the SW. I initially had thought that the single orb was a forthcoming helicopter (mayo one does fly in this area) however, after seeing no motion and then witnessing the 3 in the sky, forming a perfect triangle, I knew that this was something completely different. I'm not sure what I witnessed but the fact that it maintained a perfectly triangular shape and quickly disappeared, after 30 minutes had elapsed, left quite a lasting impression in my mind.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
