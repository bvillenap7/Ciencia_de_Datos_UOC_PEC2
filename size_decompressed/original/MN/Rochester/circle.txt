1 satelight and  3 unknown white and red objects that followed in the opposite direction flying silent in the sky-;2006-04-20 22:05:00;4 minutes;1 satelight and  3 unknown white and red objects that followed in the opposite direction flying silent in the sky- I watched the same faint Satelight go flying through the sky from North to South until I couldn't see it anymore. Then suddenly I saw another object flying almost on the same path flying (south to North) but this object was bright and then very faint and then bright and and very faint continuing until it was out of range.  Then seconds after that object passed I saw another object in which had a very bright red light and it appeared out of the Northwest sky and slowly headed towards that object that just had passed at a different angle and it then blinked it's red light several times at another object headed in the opposite direction ( as if it was comunicating with the last object coming in from the east. The last object had a bright red light and it moved swiftly through the sky towards the third object until I couldn't see it anymore. I know the first object was a satelight, but I'm not sure about the other three objects. I have never seen lights of this nature and I'm 99.99999% sure that it was not a aircraft of our nature. Plus the objects were silent...;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
Very bright circle that suddenly disappeared;2010-10-16 22:45:00;10 seconds;Very bright circle that suddenly disappeared I was driving home at about 10:45 and I saw a bright object in the sky.  I looked up at it and it was massive, probably about half as big as a half-moon.  It was very white, almost blinding. Its shape was like the sun, with a circle and light radiating from the circle.  It didn’t flash like an airplane or helicopter.  The object moved very slightly down and to the right, and then it completely disappeared.  I couldn’t hear the object at all as well.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
Bright light moving erratically in all directions;2019-10-18 01:00:00;40 minutes;Bright light moving erratically in all directions. I told myself my eyes were playing games and it wasn’t moving like I thought, so I shut one eye and didn’t move my head and positioned my head so I could barely see it on the edge of the window and it keeps moving in and out of sight.  Bright light would occasionally change color and brightness. Clouds could account for brightness change but I simply can’t explain the odd flying patterns in all directions. Have very grainy cell video. Difficult to make out but odd movement still noticeable. Doubtful someone would be flying a drone around 1:30 am in rural southern MN so high in the air..? Object appeared NW of Rochester, MN.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
