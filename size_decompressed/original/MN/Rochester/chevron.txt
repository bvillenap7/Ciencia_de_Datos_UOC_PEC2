solid red chevron-shaped ufo formation sighting in Rochester, Minnesota 2004;2004-03-10 01:00:00;45 seconds;solid red chevron-shaped ufo formation sighting in Rochester, Minnesota 2004 I saw 7 or 10 solid red chevron-shaped crafts flying in a v formation. They looked very small, so maybe they were extremely high up. They must have been moving very fast, because they appeared to fly from horizon to horizon in a northwest direction (as though they spanned  the distance from LaCrosse, Wisconsin to Minneapolis, Minnesota) in about 45 seconds.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948

I noticed it was in the shape of a bird soaring and it was moving slowly towards the east.  It was moving about the speed of a plane and after about 3 seconds it disappeared behind a cloud. I just tried to shrug it off until a few seconds later I saw another farther down the sky and another flying very closely by it.  One disapeared as if into thin air and the other disapeared passed the clouds.  As the clouds moved I saw a few more come into view,a few at the same time and a few going faster before disapearing. I kept looking up for about 30 minutes I didn't see anything else but I saw about 7-10 of these flying lighted objects within 5 minutes.
