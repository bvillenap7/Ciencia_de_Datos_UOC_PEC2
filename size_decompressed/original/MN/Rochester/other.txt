Saw and heard what appeared to be a non-human entity.;2018-08-12 04:30:00;<1 minute;Saw and heard what appeared to be a non-human entity. Checking email before heading to bed after a fun night of video games.  Did not feel stressed, overly tired, or creeped out at all - just ready to go to sleep.  I heard heavy breathing behind me at my office door - not human.  I assumed that it was my dog.  She is usually locked up in a room during the night, but the room can be easily opened from the outside by pushing on the door, and my cat sometimes lets the dog out.  I turned around, ready to talk to my dog, and saw a non-human face (grey, elongated features, can't remember the eyes).  It was so alarming that I jumped out of my chair and grabbed an object.  When I turned back to the door, it was gone.  I have tried telling myself that it wasn't real, and I have refused to tell anyone for fear of being ostracized.  No noticeable signs of a craft (audible or visual).  Strange and quickly disappearing scratch marks the next morning (scratches were white in a red blotchy area rather than red).
