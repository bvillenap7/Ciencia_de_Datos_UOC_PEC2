Long silvery object spotted in sky.;1998-09-03 10:30:00;30 seconds;Long silvery object spotted in sky. I was driving along a road on the way to work in the morning when I looked up and my eyes got a glint of something shiny. I looked up and thought I saw the fuselage of an airplane to the south. But as I looked more intently I realized it was not moving but remained stationary. And then within a few seconds it sped of at an incredible speed and disappeared. This is very similar to what I had seen a couple years previous. Also the next night Me and a friend of mine returning from byron,mn to rochester saw something green break up very close to the ground. believe it was a meteor or space junk?;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
