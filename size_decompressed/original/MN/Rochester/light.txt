Bright lights in the sky witnessed from highway;1999-10-04 03:00:00;2+ hours;Bright lights in the sky witnessed from highway The first one looked like a star at first, then it moved so we thought it was a plane, then it stopped, and started changing color from red to white to blue. it stayed relatively still for awhile, then zigzagged, then stopped again. Hung hovering in sky for about an hour and a half, brightening and dimming. I saw a plane fly directly past it.  Then the driver of the car I was in spotted another one on the other side of the sky brighter than the first.  This one was going from red to blue to yellow, and brightening and dimming, it was so low in the horizon that we lost it behind some trees for awhile, but it was definately moving.  Then we drove into La Crosse which was covered in a fog and we did not see them again ((NUFORC Note:  Except for the reported movement of the objects, the description is consistent with twinkling stars.  Movement is very difficult to establish by a witness who is in a moving vehicle.  However, we were not there to witness the objects.));44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
There were 2 erratic moving lights in the sky.;2002-05-31 23:00:00;1 minute;There were 2 erratic moving lights in the sky. While I was out walking my dogs, I was watching the sky, looking at stars.  2 stars caught my eye, at first I thought it was a satellite, but after looking on more I realized that it looked like one light was trying to catch the other, then back off, going up and down, and then the first object looked like it was doing the same thing  I ran home to get my husband, but by the time I went 2 houses to our home the lights were gone.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948

Lighted object in orbital motion changed color, stopped, moved erratically at varying speeds, on a non-orbital path.;2011-08-28 21:45:00;3 minutes;Lighted object in orbital motion changed color, stopped, moved erratically at varying speeds, on a non-orbital path. 08/28/2011   @ 2145 CT  Observed a lighted object moving W to E at zenith position. Thought this was perhaps the ISS as we had followed sightings in the last couple of weeks. The object was white, and brightened from zenith to 10 degrees declination, then began to dim, and appear to diminish in size by roughly Â½, and went from white to red in color.  At this point the object stopped tracking to the east and held stationary for approximately 5-8 seconds, then began to move in a northerly direction at a slow speed, paused, moved north again, moving faster and stopped again. The object moved back after that in an east to west direction at varying speeds, pausing at times, sometimes making abrupt sweeping curves and coming to sudden stops, then beginning to move in slow, small movements for short distances, pausing and moving again. It did not move like any plane or helicopter I have ever seen. No sound was observed related to this object. The light from the object was red, steady, and seemed to dim in relation to traveling a greater distance from my position of observation.  The duration of the sighting was approximately 3 minutes.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
A star like object moves across the sky at super speed.;2012-08-05 23:00:00;10 min;A star like object moves across the sky at super speed. I was out side in my backyard at around 11pm with my friends. It was a beautiful night.  You could see thousands of stars outside.  But as we starred a the sky we saw a red light the didnt move and was just blinking like some of the stars.  But unusual because it was pritty big.  But i didnt move for about 20 min so we thought it was just a star.  We went on with our business. 20min later when i look up in the sky that blinking light was moving right across the sky.  It wasnt a plaine cause we didnt here any jet sounds plus it was moving too fast to be any plane, and moved soo quickly and smooth to be a plane.  We were trying to not blink cause we thought it would disappear.  It looked to us that it was a star instead of a light going about 3,000 miles.  But as we lookk the light starts to fade.  Like litterly fades as we are starring at it.  It took about 5 seconds to disappear.  I wana telll everyone this after i saw that i was no longer a E.T critic.  I know what i saw, and i know that there is something up there and they have/are visiting us.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
Red/White Flashing Hovering Light.;2013-12-27 21:30:00;2 hours;Red/White Flashing Hovering Light It looks very similar to a star, but seems to move left, right, up and down slightly.  It seems to flash white and red.  I think it was quite a ways to the right of Orion. I noticed it when I went out for a walk at night. It seems to have moved across the sky quite a distance when I wasn't paying attention to it.;44.0894640226632;-92.4258470254948
