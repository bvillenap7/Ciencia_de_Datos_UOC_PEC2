Object hovering treetop high over a field. The craft was between 150 to 200 yards away.   Could see a red and green light a distance apart like a small aircraft would have been.   When craft moved from west to east, a bright white light appeared to come on at the rear.  The three lights together made a triangular appearance, but I personally could not see any space between any of the lights.  There was no sound from the craft.  The craft did not wobble when it made its exit from field, nor did it move forward to turn.  It simply left.  My passenger said that the craft had a spherical shape.  Conditions were clear. Looking at video of V22 osprey, Harrier and F-13 aircraft, it was none of these.   Closest military installation is 60 miles to east but none of these are stationed there.
