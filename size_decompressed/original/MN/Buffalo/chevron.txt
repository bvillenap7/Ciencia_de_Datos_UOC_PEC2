I was wearing polarized sunglasses which made the seven objects much easier to see.  They seemed very high up in the sky.  The objects were flying very closely together at first and then starting splitting off - one group of two and a group of five.  There was no sound to be heard nor a trail.  At first my coworkers and I thought that it could be gliders, but, not only because of the altitude, the objects changed direction, this seemed unlikely.  They moved very smoothly through the air.  They would stop briefly and continue moving.  We could see them only barely with the naked eye, but through polarized sunglasses they were unmistakeable, white chevron shaped objects.  The hovered around back and forth for nearly five minutes before moving out of view to the east beyond the building we work in.;45.1846000000004;-93.8632999999983
