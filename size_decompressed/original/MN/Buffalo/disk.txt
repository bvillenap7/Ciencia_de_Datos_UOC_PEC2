There were alot of fireworks going off that night,and we were unsure what it may be until they contiued to move closer it was our belief that it was an ufo they moved closer until they were about 200 feet from us and about half mile above. They hovered over us for nearly a minute and then in the blink of an eye they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
