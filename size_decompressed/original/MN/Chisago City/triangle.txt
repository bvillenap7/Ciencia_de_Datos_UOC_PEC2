perfect triangle of moving orange lights in Minnesota;2009-07-04 23:59:00;15 mins;perfect triangle of moving orange lights in Minnesota Fourth of July, my cousin and I were watching TV in the basement at my uncles house waiting for my aunt and uncle to get back home.  All of the sudden the downstairs door opens and my uncle sticks his head in and says, get out here you gota see this.   We assume its just some cool fireworks across the lake, but when we get out there we see two yellow/orange lights in the air slowly moving south in perfect tandum.  My uncle said that when he first saw them they did a 180 degree rotation without changing distance between each other.  So it takes about 5 minutes for these two lights to slowly move into the distance and disappear (we said they moved about as fast as helicopters do from a distance).   Once they disappear I am convinced that they were some crazy fireworks that someone launched somehow.  But as we were heading in three big lights of the same color take off from the horizon straight into the air like something out of the movies, and form a perfectly symmetrical triangle in the air and slowly heads towards the south as well.   No I do not believe in aliens as of now but I don't think there is an explanation for what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
