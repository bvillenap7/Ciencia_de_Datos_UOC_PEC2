Bright white light, comes and goes in seconds but disappears mid air;2011-07-28 19:30:00;A few seconds;Bright white light, comes and goes in seconds but disappears mid air My mother and I were driving back from Bemidji towards Blackduck when we saw a bright white ball streak across the sky.  It came out of nowhere and then disappeared in the same fashion, the entire event lasting 2-3 seconds. I think it is safe to say that it is not a play or a shooting star because it was very bright and disappeared before coming anywhere near the treeline on the horizon.  The light was heading towards earth. It appeared to be crashing but there was no other flash apart from the bright light that came and went.;47.74;-94.4932
