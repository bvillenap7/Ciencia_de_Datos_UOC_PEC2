We went over to take a look and saw two teardrop shaped objects.  They appeard to be moving to the southwest slowly.   The objects looked to be about 12 feet long and about 8 feet wide mabey.  We could not make out the color of the objects because it was night.  The objects also were illuminated around the bottom and seemed to glide across the open sky.
