It is isolated from all city lights as it is located in the Minnesota lakes country. On Oct. 8th, 1999 at 11:15PM My wife and I were outside in the backyard looking for satelites and shooting stars. The sky was very clear. I first thought I saw a satelite, but noticed there were 3 lights moving in a triangle. I showed it to my wife to make sure she saw the same thing. They were moving at the speed and brightness of a satelite. It was fairly large and moving at a steady speed.The center of the three lights would block out background stars,as it moved from West/Northwest to South/Southeast.It is very quiet in the woods as we have no close neighbors. There was no sound at all, we can hear commercial airliners at very high altitudes when it is that still and quiet. After about 2 to 3 minutes the lights disappered. ((NUFORC NOTE:  These satellites may be U. S. Navy satellites, flying in formation.  The same type of phenomenon was reported to us during August and September 1996, and Mr. Terence Dickinson, astronomy journalist for the Toronto (Canada) Star newspaper, apparently was able to identify their origin.));46.8193000000001;-95.8451999999999
A black triangular craft with white lights at the vertices flew across the Northern Minnesota sky headead southwest.;2007-07-19 13:00:00;30 Seconds;A black triangular craft with white lights at the vertices flew across the Northern Minnesota sky headead southwest. I was sitting in my camp chair in an area northeast of the city of Detroit Lakes. I was in an isolated area with very little light pollution. The night was very clear and I could see every star in the big dipper constellation, a testament to the clarity of the skies. I was looking Northward when from the right side of my vision (The East), a black, triangular craft with one bright white light, about magnitude 2.0, at each one of the three vertices of the triangle. The craft flew westward with a slight southern turn, it was completely silent throughout the duration of the flight. I observed it fly across the entire sky, from my point of view the object seemed to be two hundred feet long at least. I have taken several astronomy classes and have a background in the physical sciences. I am very skeptical by nature, I am however, unable to explain this event.;46.8193000000001;-95.8451999999999
