Small, burnt orange colored craft paralleled flight path of well-lit helicopter.;2004-05-06 01:14:00;10 seconds;Small, burnt orange colored craft paralleled flight path of well-lit helicopter. I heard a low-flying helicopter so I looked out my bedroom window.  The helicopter had bright lights on the front and was flying at 700 ft moving southeast. After the helicopter flew from view I saw a burnt orange object flying from the same direction the helicopter came from (west-northwest) and flying in the same direction (southeast) on a parallel flight path just north of the helicopter's flight path. The orange craft appeared to move at 1.5 times the speed of the helicopter and it made no sound. It appeared diamond shape as it flew away, but from the side, as it passed, it appeared more like a flattened ball. I was impressed at its smooth flight characteristics and that it made no sound.  It exhibited no strobe lights nor the red and green lights of an aircraft. Jst a burnt orange color.;45.3511;-93.7398000000001
