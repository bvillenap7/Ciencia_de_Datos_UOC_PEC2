Burnt orange ill-defined vertical diamond shape moved at 150 mph W to E at 1:30 a.m. at 300 ft.;2005-08-01 01:30:00;60 seconds;Burnt orange ill-defined vertical diamond shape moved at 150 mph W to E at 1:30 a.m. at 300 ft. Went to window to watch a low-flying helicopter move from west to east about a mile away.  It was a clear, quiet night. Looking north from my second story bedroom window I pulled down the top sash of the double hung window to watch through the screen and smell the night air. The room light was off.  As the helicopter moved off to the east and the blade noise faded I noticed a burnt orange-colored ball of light appear in the west and moving silently to the east seemingly tracking the helicopter but on a parallel path I estimated an additional mile north of the helicopter's flight path. The ball of light was moving about 150 mph, about half again as fast as the helicopter.  It appeared to be about 600 ft above the ground.  I tried to resolve its shape but I could not until it had moved off to the east.  The window screen pixelated the view and I finally convinced myself that the the orange ball of light actually had a vertical diamond shape, although that was not readily obvious.  Most of the time it seemed to have an amorphous, ill-defined shape.  The light was seen for about 30 seconds. It was completely silent.  The size of the amorphous-shaped object, if two miles away at 600 feet, seemed to be between 30 to 40 feet,  It was as tall as it was wide.;45.3511;-93.7398000000001
orange/amberish orb sighted on the ground in the early morning hours;2007-05-31 04:20:00;2 minutes;orange/amberish orb sighted on the ground in the early morning hours I was driving to work at 0420 and I was about a mile from home headed toward the south to St. Paul International Airport. I noticed this bright orange/amberish orb to my right, the west, in a field on the ground. I watched it as I drove by it for about a minute or two. It was about 15 feet in diameter. There were no apparent doors or windows seen. No blinking lights of any kind. I didn't hear any sound, but I believe I had my window rolled up. I didn't see any movement around it as I was watching for people or something to clarify what I was seeing. There was no one else on the road it was very dark. For the next several mornings I watched the same area, but it did not reappear. If it was an aircraft I would have known as I grew up by Camp Ripley and used to watch the military jets and helicopters fly over day and night. I am also a private pilot and an A & P mechanic so I am quite familiar with the majority of  aircraft and their lighting.;45.3511;-93.7398000000001
