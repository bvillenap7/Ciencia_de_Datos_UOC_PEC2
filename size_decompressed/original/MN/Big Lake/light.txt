I noticed that there were stars out and that one(1st seen NW corner of yard) appeared to be larger and more orange than is normal for a star.  I looked deeper and there was a smaller light of the same color not too far from the larger light. I began to think at this point they were not stars.  I notices the lights would suddenly get brighter and then throw of bursts of light, then dim and appear to slowly move and stop quickly.  I couldn't even tell they were moving at first but once I had to move so I could see around the large oak tree in my yard I was sure.  Also noticed the 2 orange lights moved precisely at the same time and this is when I noticed that there were 2 blue-yellow-white very small lights moving along with the orange in a way so all the lights could form a diamond.  I watched for a few hours as the lights followed same routine.  Sit, then flicker and flash a bit, dim, then bounce suddenly along.  At about 4:45 5:00 am as the first bit of sun started coming up I watched the two yellow lights move into the large orange light which then blinked red and vanished alongwith every  other star(ended in NE corner of sky).  A little less than an hour afterwards I just so happend to be taking my do out and looked towards that corner of the sky and watched the orange  light appear again suddenly.  Then slide off slowly in the sky.;45.3511;-93.7398000000001
