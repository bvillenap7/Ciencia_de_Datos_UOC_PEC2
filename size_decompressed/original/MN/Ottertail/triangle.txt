Large dark reflective object with no lights.;2018-09-12 21:20:00;1 minute;Large dark reflective object with no lights It looked like a large reflective object - moving southwest over Lake Otttertail - me and my sister saw it moving pretty fast across the night sky after the moon had set, so it was very dark with lots of stars - we couldn't tell how close to us it was - no lights at all on the object but we think we could see the edges - it was all rounded - there were no sharp edges - because it was reflective -   My sister and I were up visiting our parents for their ((deleted--50-60th)) anniversary at their lake house on Ottertail Lake in Minnesota.;46.4163;-95.5419
