I looked at a particular patch of stars and noticed an object with the same shape and brightness as a star.  The object was definately on the outside of the Earth's atmosphere. We suspected that the object/craft was performing manuevers because it would travel in a straight line, the take hard, right angled turns to the right or left.  On occassion, it would travel in partial circular motions and, again take hard, right angled turns.  There was no way of determining the exact speed, but the fact that it was outside the Earth's atmosphere and we could notice substantial movement, we could only conclude that it was traveling at an incredible velocity. In retrospect, I should've tracked it for as long as I could, but got bored and went on to other things. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));46.019;-92.8959
