silent low flying cloaked Triangle in Minnesota/South Dakota;2000-09-01 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;silent low flying cloaked Triangle in Minnesota/South Dakota It was about 10pm and we were driving south of an area in MN known as Buffalo Ridge at about this time I looked out my window of the car I was in the seat behind the driver but anyway as i looked out the window i saw a craft maybe no more than about 100-200 feet off the ground and was in the shape of an equallatteral triangle  with a light on every point as it passed over us the driver stopped the car the kid sitting next to me stayed in the car and me and my dad got out to look at it as it came over us we noticed that there was no sound coming from it no sound of a jet or propeller or anything and one of the strait sides of the triangle was the leading edge, the craft moved very slowly from the NE to the SW in the matter of about 20-25 minutes after it passed over us we could also see through it like it was cloaked I could see stars through the perimeter inside of the triangle thats why i think it was cloaked but the stars  looked like they were distorted from heat kind of like when u look at something through the heat of a grill but after it passed we got in the car and continued to atch it fly in  the same direction until we couldnt see it anymore which was until we made it to just outside of Souix Falls, South Dakota more than 70 miles from where we had spotted it and by that time the craft was well into S. Dakota;43.9868;-96.2696
