Cloudy V formation UFO seen over Southern MN;2010-04-18 22:00:00;less than a minute;Cloudy V formation UFO seen over Southern MN me and a friend were sitting around a fire when i was plying with a laser looking into the smoke that was risin when i saw what looked like a flock of birds coming from the east to the west. it was an uneven v shaped formation commonly seen in geese and ducks except it was at least 20,000 feet in altitude and probably 600 feet from tip to tip, going at least twice as fast as a commercial passenger jet,it was whitish gray yet cloudy so we couldn't tell how many objects there were, but he called his friend who lives about 4 city blocks away and he described it exactly as what we saw. it was also completly silent. if it had been birds we would have heard them, and if it was an aircraft of any kind, we would have heard the engine roar, the closest military base ks hundreds of miles away and they don't perform training missions like that.  i texted my brother (who is going to school for commercial aviation) and he said it might bea kc 135 or other large cargo carr! ier. Which does not fit my description. silent, 600 foot span, no blinking lights which would be visible on a clear night like this, and it was also visible that there was no tail if it was a plane. uneven v formation, slightly longer appendage on one side.;43.8241;-94.4317
