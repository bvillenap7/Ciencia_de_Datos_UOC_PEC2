It was about 7:45am central time, and I was on freeway I-94 east looking at the sun rising when just to the left of the sun i saw a very bright &quot()&quot shaped object with a hollow center... It was extremely bright and vivid like a star.  At first it was just outlines of that () shape which made me look closer because i have never seen anything like that with a hallow.  I was trying to see which direction it was moving, and it looked like it was heading up at first, but as i kept looking it was heading downwards which made me wonder if it was a meteorite or something that entered our atmosphere.  But as it got lower it turned from the original hollow “()&quot shape to a solid circle.  That’s when I knew it was something weird, because there was no jet stream behind it or anything... and then it kind of hovered in place, and looked like a bright star. It then got ! really small like it was going further away from me, and then grew bigger a few seconds later like it was getting closer again. It was moving in all different directions up, down, left and right…I knew this because I was measuring the gap between the object and the sun. It was early, so the sun was not harsh on my eyes.  I wanted to call the police or something but didn’t know who to call.  The only explanation I could think of for it being the “()&quot shape when i first noticed it, was if it was going at super sonic speeds into our atmosphere, giving that effect from such a far distance... I did not take a picture because it was too far away and would have just looked like a white speck on my camera phone.
