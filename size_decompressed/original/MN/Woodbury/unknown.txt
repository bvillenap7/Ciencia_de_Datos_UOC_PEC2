Silent, orange, glowing craft flies over Woodbury Minnesota.;2011-07-22 22:40:00;5 minutes;Silent, orange, glowing craft flies over Woodbury Minnesota. This evening when I walked outside my suburban Minnesota home, I saw what appeared to be a cigar shaped craft flying in a straight line from South to North.  The entire craft was glowing with a flickering orange light that made it appear as though it were on fire and also made it difficult to tell the size and shape of the craft.   It flew over my house close enough that if it had been an airplane I would have heard it's engines, I heard nothing.   At first I thought it may have been a meteorite but it continued on its course not appearing to change altitude at all.   I did pull out my iPhone and record video however by the time I had gotten to it, all I managed to record was what looks like a moving spot of light in the black night sky.;44.909;-92.93765
Unexplained lights over Woodbury MN.;2011-09-20 01:30:00;30 Seconds;Unexplained lights over Woodbury MN. I initially saw two red lights through my drapes.  I opened them and saw two bright red lights in the sky. It looked like a pair of giant binoculars facing my direction in the sky.  I could see the two round red lights, and also a smaller mass in between them.   After about 10-15 seconds a smaller bright pinpoint of  white light dropped from the thing straight down, then as it was about to touch the ground, it shot horizontal, then straight up into the sky higher than the main object.   After this, the main object disappeared.  I have worked for the federal goverment for 25 years.  I have never saw or reported anything like this before.  The sighting has left me feeling very nervous. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.909;-92.93765
