I thought it was a plane but in my area, they usually pass by in the opposite direction.  I decided it was a bird since it was white but then the altitude did not match.  Then the object, stopped mid air.  I jumped closer to the window to see if I could get a better look and 3 more objects followed the first one.  All had same shape, size and color.  They positioned themselves in front of the first, in a straight line, also fixating their position mid air.  Following that, the original object in a circular motion, moved in front of them.  Then, copying what the first one did, they also, in a circular motion, moved in front of the first object.  After this, they continued (all 4 objects) to move in a spiraling motion, like a carousel.  Always moving N , and about 50 seconds after all of this happened, they went behind a cloud.  I was ready to snap a picture if they emerged from behind the cloud but they never did.;44.909;-92.93765
