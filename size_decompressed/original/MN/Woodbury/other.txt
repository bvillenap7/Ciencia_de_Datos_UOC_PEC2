String of 20+ small, star-like lights moving silently, in unison in a perfect line, NW to SE.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-25 21:05:00;2 minutes;String of 20+ small, star-like lights moving silently, in unison in a perfect line, NW to SE Moving from NW moving SE, a trail of many lights (20+) that were the size of small stars moved one behind the other in a perfectly straight line. Some where closer together than others, but all in a straight line moving the same direction together. It went quickly over our house and was silent the entire time. It moved fast and disappeared into the clouds to the SE. it looked like the lights were all tied together on a string being pulled across the sky. We all saw it and can not explain it. We were just looking at an application on my phone that showed the stars and constellation in real time as they orbit in an augmented reality. When I saw the moving line of lights, I opened the application. The application did not label the moving stars when I pointed my camera at the apparitions. We are a white family in a middle upper class neighborhood. I believe in aliens. The objects left no trail or sound.;44.909;-92.93765
