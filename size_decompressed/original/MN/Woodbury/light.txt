Blue green rotating lights;2006-08-06 21:30:00;2 hrs;Blue green rotating lights As we were walking our dog at 21:30, I noticed what appeared to be a star in the SW sky. What was unique about this was the color was blue green. When we got home I looked at the object thru our binoculars. Now I could see that instead of 1 light it was composed of 4 lights that were rotating. The object remained almost stationary for the entire sighting. At 23:15 it dropped below the tree line and I couldn't see it anymore. I have about 15 minutes of video of the object. The object seemed to be about 30 degrees up from the horizon. As I watched the object, a bright star rotated into view close to the object and then set during the hour and 45 minutes of observation.;44.909;-92.93765

Four lights low in the night sky, orange, traveling low and slow.;2014-05-31 22:15:00;1 minute;Four lights low in the night sky, orange, traveling low and slow. We were travelling east on I-94 (between Woodbury & Stillwater)when we spotted four lights in the sky directly ahead of us.  At first I thought that they were planes lined up ready to make a landing, but then quickly realized we were a little too far out of the city for that.  Next, I realized that each light seemed low in the sky for a plane, then I noted that each seemed to be orange in color with no flashing lights.   Then I noted that as we passed under them that they each seemed to be travelling quite slowly.  My partner and I both observed the lights and both thought that they were very unusual and did not appear to be planes.;44.909;-92.93765
3 bright lights in formation, then 1 by 1 disappear.;2020-03-20 23:11:00;10 minutes;3 bright lights in formation, then 1 by 1 disappear. Wife and I were driving down 94 westbound towards Minneapolis and saw 2 lights (southwest) in the sky that looked similar to a tower of some sort. As we kept driving down the freeway, the lights were slowly moving until they were vertically aligned. Then the lights were out of line again and I started recording in my phone. They were bright yellow ish lights that seemed to be moving in our direction. Eventually a 3rd light popped up but disappeared shortly after and moved faster . The 2 lights remained still until 1 light veered left and disappeared. The last light slowly started moving away and almost “shut off” its bright light and looked like a regular plane blinking and was not bright anymore. My I took a video because I feel like no one ever records these things when they happen. My wife said she saw them flashing maybe with a green tint  but I couldn’t tell. I have glasses and corrective vision and she has 20/20 if not better so I believe her.;44.909;-92.93765
