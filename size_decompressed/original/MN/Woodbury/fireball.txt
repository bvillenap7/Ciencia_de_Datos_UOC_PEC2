I observed a total of 4 high speed traveling fireballs beginning in the northwestern sky, traveling very quickly across the sky toward the southeast.  As each ball crossed above it almost appeared as if the fire was like a rocket burner moving in a circular direction.  As each object traveled away it became less and less intense. I imagine this was due to the distance traveled.  As the first object was reaching the more southern half of the sky, the next one appeared.  I thought I may have seen what appeared to be lightening but I can't be certain and there are no current storms in the area.;44.909;-92.93765
