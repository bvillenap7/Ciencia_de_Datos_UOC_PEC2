My friends and I had stopped at a park, kind of for a small party.  We were there for about two minutes just talking when right in front of our eyes my friend's truck stopped running on its own.  I looked at my friend's but they were baffled too.  They didn't have any kind of remote starter mechanism either.  I got in the car to try and figure out what was wrong and about 30 seconds later my friend's told me to get out of the truck NOW. I got out because they actually sounded serious.  I looked up and saw three bright lights about 150 yards up.  It was dark out so I'm not sure it was that high.  It didn't make a sound AT ALL. The ovalish shaped object didn't do anything to us. It was dead quiet and the small breeze seemed to stop on its own.   It hovered above us not doing anything for about 45 seconds to a minute.  Then it just took off.  The truck started right up too.  We booked out of there like nothing else.;45.0716450000001;-93.4556750000002
