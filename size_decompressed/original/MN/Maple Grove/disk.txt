This object had three long oval, light green lights on it.  It was silent but could manuver VERY swiftly.  It was an eerie and bit scary thing to observe.  Is was almost stationary in one part of the sky.  It left the sky at around 4:50 AM. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
