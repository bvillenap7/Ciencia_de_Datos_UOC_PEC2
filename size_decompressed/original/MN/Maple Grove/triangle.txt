2 ufos you could see inside one.;2016-11-16 20:05:00;3 minutes;2 ugos you could see inside one. On a street that usually has a lot of street lamps but it was bitch (sic.  pitch) black.   There were two ufo's.  One was 3 orbs lined up hovering above the second one in the shape of a triangle but the triangle legs were rectangles.  You could see inside the triangles and there were red and blue lights.  It almost looked as if there were little people in there.  There were 3 bright lights on each end on the triangle.  It was hovering not to far above the tree line.  I was driving and didn't take a picture but should have.  One of the weirdest things I have ever seen.  It was in a neighborhood.  The orbs were white. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))  Hi i did mean pitch black.  Two days after i drove down the same street and it was fully lit with street lamps which it was not that night.  I have been looking constantly online to see if anyone else has reported it.  The date it happened on was Wednesday, November 16th.   I was going 10 mph under the speed limit looking at this thing and everyone else behind me was going just as slow so i can't be the only one who saw it although i do not know how to find anyone else.  I just really hope someone else reports it.  I should have taken a picture when i had the chance.  ((END ADDENDUM));45.0716450000001;-93.4556750000002
