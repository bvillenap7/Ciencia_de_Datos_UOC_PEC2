Fireballs seen over Maple Grove MN;2011-09-21 21:30:00;3 minutes;Fireballs seen over Maple Grove MN It was Sept 21 at 9:30 pm when a friend of mine and myself were outside having a cigarette when I looked up and saw a bright amber ball of light, (looked exactly like  The red “fireballs” in Lumberton, New Jersey, on Saturday night, July 30, 2011, that you have pictured on your home page) flying underneath a very low cloud cover.   To our amazement there was not one but five flying one behind the other. These objects were very close to us and we could hear no noise.  They flew by us and ascended up into the clouds. Now there could be an explanation for these being military aircraft do pass by us from time to time.  But it doesn’t explain hearing no noise and the bright fiery amber look.  If they were a headlight from a plane you would think after passing us the lights would have dimmed, which they did not.  The only for sure way to know would be to contact the Air-force base in Minneapolis and find out if there were a number of military aircraft in the Maple Grove a! rea at 9:30pm on the 21st of Sept.

Flame-like flying object sighted along normal airline flight path over Twin Cities.  ((anonymous report));2019-09-01 22:37:00;3 minutes;Flame-like flying object sited along normal airline flight path over Twin Cities A very bright light appeared from the northwest traveling to the southeast.  The color temperature was fire- colored.  The speed of travel was similar to an airliner.  The size of the light was 2x to 3 x larger than normal airplane front lights.  I grabbed binoculars and when I focused on the light the appearance was flame-like.  There was no visible body shape.  The height appeared to be a few thousand feet.  As the light passed overhead the intensity receded in diameter but the brightness remained until it fell behind the tree, one permanently.  No sound was evident.  No trail or tail was in evidence.
