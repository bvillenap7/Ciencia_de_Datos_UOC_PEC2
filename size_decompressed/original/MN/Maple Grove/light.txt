While looking south at the moon, at about SSE, there was an object that was was Very Bright, way to bright to be star or planet and way to bright to be a plane sitting stationary (we are right in the fly way for an airport so we know what planes look like coming in ).  I called my wife and had her come out and she also witnesed the object.  The object was there tell I finished my cigerette.  When I went back out about about 15 minutes later it was gone.   I probably would not have reported it, but noticed some one in MTKA MN had seen what sounds to be the exact same thing (and where I was looking was right where MTKA would be) but there sighting seems to be a little later. Whatever it was, it was BRIGHT. ((NUFORC Note:  We note that the planet Mars would have been in generally the same area of the sky that the witness indicates above.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I have already sent a report on this, but wanted to mention a mistake I made. The object I seen was SSW. Would of there been possibly a star in this area? I was looking directly South. The moon was out and this object was was about halfway between the horizon and the moon and about 15 degrees to the right. Exactly where the MTKA sighting was on the same date. Not that I was seeing the same object. But it was really something to see. If anyone could just give me friendly email to let me know, it would be very much appreciated. I Have always been very interested in UFO's ever since as a child at the age of about 13 me and about 6 other kids were out in a swampy area in Minnetonka, where I grew up. We used to go out in the cat tails and and pat down a circle and hang out together. One evening it was getting dark, and we all decided that we should probably get going. We all stood up and, when one of my friends looked up and said hey look at that! I looked up and to my surprise was three star looking objects in a triangle. the wierd thing is that this tringle of three star looking objects were so high up that they looked to be up in space, and also that they were moving at a slight angle straight up into space. As far away as they were ( if you held out a marble in your fingers that's about how spaced they were), the triangle had to be so far apart I can't even begin wonder how far apart they were to make that triangle. They just kept moving almost staight up into space tell we couldn't see them. This all happenend in a matter of about 20 to 30 seconds. Very impressive. I hope I am not wasting your time, but after seeing that I have always been very interested.;45.0716450000001;-93.4556750000002
Orange ball of light flying across maple grove MN.  traveling at high speed and made no sound.;2008-08-22 21:00:00;3 min;Orange ball of light flying across maple grove MN.  traveling at high speed and made no sound. my wife and I Observed a orange ball of light traveling above horizon.  The object was moving fast but was very visable as it was not very far away.  There was no sound to the object.  We watched the object until it was no longer visable.  aprox. 3 min.  It was NOT an air plane or helecopter.  NO SOUND AT ALL. My wife and I live in rurall maple grove and I am sure someone else had to have observed the same thing????;45.0716450000001;-93.4556750000002
Bright variable speed light over Maple Grove, MN.;2016-05-21 21:50:00;30 seconds;Bright variable speed light over Maple Grove, MN. Observation time is +/- 5 mins, as I did not look at time until discussing observation with other witnesses.   While sitting on my deck with family, I witnessed a bright light in the southern sky, perhaps 30 deg. above horizon, moving quite quickly to the north trending west slightly.  I thought it might be an airplane reflecting sunlight as it was not far past sunset, or satellite but the light was very intense even for either of the mentioned options.   I pointed out the light to my family, my father saw it right away.  The light started to slow down until it reached maybe 45 deg. above the horizon.  It then stopped in place, became less intense and then winked out.  My father who would normally disagree with any possibility of such an event even agreed that it was an extraordinary event.;45.0716450000001;-93.4556750000002
