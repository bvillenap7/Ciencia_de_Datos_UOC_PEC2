Red ball was floating in the sky after the firwork display in SLP, MN;2011-07-04 23:00:00;4 Minutes;A red ball was floating in the sky after the firwork display in SLP, MN.  This was not a plane or fireworks.  We made comments joking to each other such as .... we come in peace etc..., but this was certainly real.  It slowly dimmed after about 4 minutes.  Strange!!!!;44.9517333333333;-93.3524666666667
2 round light orbs flying together low in sky  that separated;2012-09-12 19:00:00;3 minutes;2 round light orbs flying together low in sky  that separated Stood in parking lot and watched two rounds lights coming towards us overhead.  They were very bright, mostly white with some color change to orange.  As they approached they were flying together laterally so we thought they were connected to something.  We knew it was not a plane because of how low they were in the sky and there was absolutely no sound. The light on the left started to veer away from the other suddenly but slowly so we were very confused then realizing they were separate entities.  It veered away as the other stayed its course.  The one veering off then went behind a cloud but we could still see it and it started to make small but extremely fast zigzag patterns in the sky.  We watched it for a minute then it slowly faded away. We turned our attention to the remaining light which continued coming overhead and then eventually also just faded away into the clouds.

Luminous ball-shaped objects.;2013-07-08 22:00:00;10 minutes;A series of large luminous ball-shaped objects rose above the trees from the horizon and slowly drifted up and to the north west at a 45 degree angle in single file disappearing into the clouds.  About a minute or less apart from one another. The balls did not blink, but remained solid.  Sometimes flicked a little. Changed color somewhat. White, green and blue mostly. I ran into the house to get my wife after I watched the first 2 or 3 objects.  My wife saw the remaining 4 or 5 objects with me float majestically up an into the clouds.  When asked, she agreed that they did not have the appearance of either an airplane, helicopter or fireworks. Didn't know what they were, and also thought what we witnessed was unusual.   Shortly after my wife came outside I ran about a block closer to where the ball-shaped objects were flying so I could try to hear a sound or get a better view with binoculars. Silence. I could not hear anything.  Through binoculars all I could see was the glowing round light.  The objects seemed large.  At least the size of a truck. The very last object was bright darkish red.  Larger than the other objects at first. (or the light around it more intense?)  Not a ball.  More like a giant red flame in the sky.  This object quickly moved up erratically and over the trees unlike any conventional aircraft and then slowed down.  It headed in the same direction as the other ball-shaped objects.  The bright red color slowly turned into what looked similar to the same color/shape as the other luminous ball-shaped objects.  Disappeared into the clouds.. Several minutes went by.  My wife went inside the house. I retrieved my camera. I then noticed two objects meet roughly in the same location as the objects were flying. First I noticed a red light and then a blue light joined it.  Within a few minutes the blue and red light started to fly in my direction (heading south west) while slowly descending!   Soon I thought I could hear a humming buzz of what I thought could have been a helicopter or a small propeller plane.  I don't know for sure. I'm usually good at identify craft by their sound.  The helicopter(s) nearly flew over me at a very low altitude. It was probably not a coincidence that the helicopter(s), if that is what they were, met where the objects were flying and then flew in my direction. I was able to photograph the helicopter(s) with the blue and red lights.  The photos are strange to say the least.  All that is visible are one blue cylinder and a red cylinder side by side seemingly too close together to have been a plane.;44.9517333333333;-93.3524666666667
