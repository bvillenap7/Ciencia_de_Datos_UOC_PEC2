Low-flying fire ball over St. Louis Park, Minnesota on 11/25/11;2011-11-25 21:30:00;15 seconds;Low-flying fire ball over St. Louis Park, Minnesota on 11/25/11 An object pulsating between fire and black came toward me off the horizon heading from south to northwest.  It moved at a moderate pace and slowed down to a stall.  After stopping about 2-3 blocks from my house the object flew straight up and to the south at a high rate of speed (like nothing I have seen in the sky).  I thought it might be a helicopter at first, but this object made no noise.  In fact I thought to myself that it was odd that just about every dog within a mile was going crazy.  So much so that after the event when I went in to tell my wife what happened, my dog went flying out of the house to see what all the commotion was about.  It was a very gloomy winter evening and the clouds were very low.   I live along a flight path of the Minneapolis airport.   I waited for three planes to come in and land and could hardly see the headlights of one of the three commercial jets landing.  This object was flying very low.  Assuming it was about two or three blocks away I would guess it was 20 feet across.   Every hair on my body was standing on end.  It was the most incredible thing I have ever seen.   Nothing about the way this thing moved was consistent with anything I have seen during the 36 years of my life.  I've been online looking for anyone else that saw it.  I haven't found anyone and post this in hopes that others will come forward.;44.9517333333333;-93.3524666666667
7 fireballs in sky above 394W and Louisiana Ave;2012-09-01 21:00:00;5 minutes;7 fireballs in sky above 394W and Luoisiana Ave We were traveling west on 394 at 9:00pm and noticed 3 dark orange fireballs in a vertical line formation.  Upon retrieving my camera we noticed 4 additional fireballs.  The additional fireballs were to the right of the vertical line and these were formed in the shape of an arrow pointing to the right.  There were a total of 7 seven fireballs. The lights were flickering and moving fast to the north.  We exited the freeway after about a minute, and the lights were disappearing.  We managed to record one fireball until it went straight up in the sky.;44.9517333333333;-93.3524666666667
