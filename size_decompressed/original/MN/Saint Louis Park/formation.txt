2 Objects directly overhead, travelling at the same speed and distance, heading south/southeast;2007-07-11 21:30:00;5 minutes;2 Objects directly overhead, travelling at the same speed and distance, heading south/southeast 7/12/2007   I was out looking upward in the night sky at constellations, facing  slightly southwest, I noticed 2 objects inside a constellation, that began to travel directly south at the same speed and at the same distance from each other. They looked like stars or satellites.  Of the two objects, one was behind the other at an angle to the lower right at almost a 45 degree angle. The two objects were heading south, south east (slightly).  What puzzles me and my wife is: 1)	the trajectory 2)	the speed being identical 3)	the distance between the two objects was identical 4)	both distance and speed NEVER changed. Remained constant.  We can only assume this is a legitimate UFO or satellites traveling in a random synchronous orbit. But the fact that I saw them start moving inside the constellation leaves us to believe this is the real deal.  PLEASE help clear this up.  Thank You.;44.9517333333333;-93.3524666666667
