My daughter and I were out on our deck. She is studying cloud formation, and weather prediction, so we routinely watch the skies daily, and nightly. The sky was clear, although it was a bit hazy, as the sun did not hurt our eyes to look up. I pointed at 2 objects in the sky, and she soon located them as well. They were very high up, as I am not good with distance, I would say higher than I have ever seen a bird, but yet when I saw them I said look at how high those birds are. She had said that they don't look like birds, as they were shining. We did not hear any engine sound, and observed that these objects were flying in circles around eachother in perfect sync, slowly. After watching for about 5-8 minutes, these 2 objects left their circular pattern, and one turned away flying straight North, which as we watched went directly above our heads, and the other followed within 30 seconds of the other, again staying in perfect sync, and distance of one another. Once these objects were directly above us, we could see a different angle of them, and noticed that their southeast corner or side was shining as the sun was shining on them. It was at first thought to be white, then we noticed it was a silver color when the sun hit them. I have seen very few birds fly that high, and this was even beyond that. We live over a direct path of airplane flight, and during this time not a single airplane was in the area. We also live in a flight area of what I believe to be Military airspace, as the Military base is not far from here. I can just about guarntee that this was an unidentified flying object. UFO's do exsist, I just can't say for sure that this is what it was at the distance we saw it at, but I also cannot find any other explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

aqua/green bright oval shaped light, stop then blast off FAST;2009-12-11 23:00:00;7 seconds;aqua/green bright oval shaped light, stop then blast off FAST We were at a stoplight at the intersection of HWY 7 and Louisiana in St.Louis Park, MN  I was looking out the front window of my friends car not even thinking (completely sober) as was the driver. I saw a aqua/green bright oval shaped light, high in the sky, slowly move in the sky, stop on point, and build some type of energy (that made it even brighter brighter) around itself, or another oval behind it, because when it blasted off you could still see the other shape the energy had formed for a second but also vanished, it was like it launched off it. It took off so fast and we were left confused as to what the hell what we had just saw. It seemed to leave a quick trail of light as it blasted off. If anyone has similar stories that night in Minnesota, please share. Or examples. Thank You.;44.9517333333333;-93.3524666666667
Large green orb;2013-03-16 23:48:00;2-3 seconds;While walking at night, out of nowhere a large green orb-like object appeared high in the sky.  It appeared to be going the speed at which a shooting star travels, but much larger in size and it did not travel across the entire sky.  It moved at high speed and disappeared after two seconds or so.;44.9517333333333;-93.3524666666667
