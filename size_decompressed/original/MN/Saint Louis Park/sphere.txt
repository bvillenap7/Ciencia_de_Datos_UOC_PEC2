I disregaurded it and said Oh, it's probably just a white balloon that was let loose. I didn't think anything of it until my dad called me into the kitchen and showed me the article about it in the paper, and I told him that I saw that the day before, but i never though anything of it... It was white, round, and just stayed there at about 60,000 ft. and hovered in the same spot for about 4 hours. When I went inside after shooting (1-2 hours later), I noticed that it hadn't moved.;44.9517333333333;-93.3524666666667
