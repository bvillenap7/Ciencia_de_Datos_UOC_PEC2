Mille Lacs Lake, Garrison, MN, strange orange rectangle lights seen over lake.;2010-07-04 21:00:00;10 min;mille Lacs Lake, Garrison MN,  strange orange rectangle lights seen over lake. We were sitting on the beach of mille Lacs Lake in Garrison MN, when a strange orange rectangle light came from the north going south right over the lake.  Of course the beach was packed with people who were there to watch the fire works that were to be shot over the lake for the 4th of July. Many people made comments about it as it was getting closer, then it turned and looked like it was going south east  but straight up into space and then it disappeared!!    After the fire works show it might have been around 22:30 or later, but all of a sudden two more lights that looked the same as the first, came from the south going north. In both cases there was no sound, no blinking lights that would indicate a human flying plane or helicopter, so I am sure it was UFOâ€™s!!!;46.2313;-93.83
