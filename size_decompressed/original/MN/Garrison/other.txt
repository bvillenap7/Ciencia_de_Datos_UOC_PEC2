UFO spotted over Garrison, Minnesota.;2012-09-12 20:50:00;30 seconds;UFO spotted over Garrison, Minnesota. On the way home from a gas station, I looked up into the sky and saw two craft in formation that had lights on them in a triangle shape.  I first thought they were C-17's or C-4's but they were moving too slow to be of those nor did they have any strobe lights! ALL military and non-military aircraft, HAVE to have strobe lights.  The crafts were located just above Borden Lake in Garrison, Minnesota traveling south east.  As far as the objects themselves go, I could not get a accurate discription on the shape of the crafts besides the lights on them, from what I could see they seemed to be cresent shaped. Once again, it was dark out and I could not get a accurate view on the shape of the hull of both craft.;46.2313;-93.83
