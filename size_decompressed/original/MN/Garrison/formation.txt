21:30 24 lights looking like satellites on a trajectory in steady succession.  ((Starlink satellites));1989-07-31 21:15:00;30 minutes;21:30 24 lights looking like satellites on a trajectory in steady succession, would verge off and make maneuvers, some parallel, one t Just as the crescent moon was rising about 9:15 pm cdt off the shoulder of Venus and straight up from Paleades is where these white lights seemed to originate.  Then at a fairly steady pacing (I lost count after 24,) these white lights the size of a star or satellite, as if in orbit like a satellite, yet would go rogue and change direction and converge with each other, stay in place and then continue all heading in same direction to the right or south. Some would parallel along the same trajectory.  Two of them were in tandem....it was so strange because I've always been looking and have not yet seen anything of this magnitude.  Then by 9:45 all movement stopped besides the few odd satalittes staying true to their rotation path. I was dumbfounded.  How would I find out if anyone else saw that?  It was if armed forces doing drills. Yet, that wasn't in our atmosphere. It had to be in space, almost as if they were coming off the moon, yet the cloud cover obscured that origination point until later when the sky was clear and movement stopped could I verify the general area described above.;46.2313;-93.83
