Bright white light, soundless hovering object near Borden Lake.;2012-11-15 06:45:00;1 minute;Bright white light, soundless hovering object near Borden Lake I was driving to work on a country road near Borden Lake.  I saw what I thought was  a bright star on the horizon as the morning sky was still dark.   All of a sudden the star became larger and I realized that I was looking at a spot light coming towards me.  It was right above the tree line.  Then it was hovering above my neighbor's house as I drove by slowly.  I could see colored lights in a cluster at the top and white lights at three corners.   At the time I thought it was a helicopter but there was NO SOUND and the trees were not moving.  It scared me so I hit the gas and took off down the road.   When I got to the end of the road I looked back and saw a large glowing red orb on the ground in the woods.  I called back to my husband at home and told him there had been a plane crash.  He went outside and saw and heard nothing.   I am a professional person with a level head and to this day I have no idea what I saw.  But it was not a helicopter and planes do not hover.  Neither are silent.;46.2313;-93.83
