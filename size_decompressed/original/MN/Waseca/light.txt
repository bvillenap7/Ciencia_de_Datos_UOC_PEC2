slow moving orange light;2014-06-20 22:00:00;5 minutes;slow moving orange light Spotted what I initially believed to be a comet.   It moved across the sky fairly slowly.   Round orange object with what seemed like a concave distortion on the front side.   Moved slowly skating side to side but maintaining a heading.   Then it turned 90° to the right flew straight for a distance then turned back about 80° and continued on.;44.0812;-93.5168
