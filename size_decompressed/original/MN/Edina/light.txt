USA, a star like object that was fixed in the sky dimmed , split up, What appeared to be a star was sighted almost directly overhead, but leaning to the west.  It seemed to bright to be a star and did not move.  The view through 4x30 bioculars did not change the objects appearance much.  Soon however, it dimmed to about half it's original brightness and eventually split in two. The two hazy blobs soon dissapeared. It was the color of a star.;44.8862166666667;-93.347625

Large bright light - stationary - growing smaller then larger - brighter then dimmer - disappearing then reappearing;2015-06-10 23:00:00;30 minutes;Large bright light - stationary - growing smaller then larger - brighter then dimmer - disappearing then reappearing I noticed a very bright light in western sky and pointed it out to a friend.  Both of us watched, waiting to see it move-but it did not.  It was very low, airplane height - but the white light was too bright and too large to be a plane.  Besides, it was stationary.  I found a spot on the horizon directly beneath object and the object remained it the same exact place.   After watching it for five minutes, we joked that it might be a new star of Bethlehem - it looked the same as Christmas card depictions.  Then, the light slowly got smaller, yet always keeping an intense center of light, until it became just a tiny pin prick - looking as if it would fade out completely.  But, it would grow brighter and larger again.  There was a pattern of the size and brightness, but it was inconsistent.   Suddenly, my friend noticed a second light, 45 degrees above to the left.  Then a 3rd light, same angle and distance, like Orion's Belt.   Then 1st light began disappearing, reappearing.   Other lights seemed to pulse more in its absence.   It was still going when we left 30 minutes later.;44.8862166666667;-93.347625
Like a flash of lightning but it stayed there;2015-11-10 00:00:00;10 seconds;Like a flash of lightning, but it stayed there. It was raining out and lightning outside.  I saw a flash of lighting but it stayed there for about 10 seconds.   The lights went out and my cat cried and started jumping up and down.
