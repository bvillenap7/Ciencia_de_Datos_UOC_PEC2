Ring of lights hovering southwest of Minneapolis.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights from local casino??  PD));2015-08-17 21:15:00;5 minutes;Ring of lights hovering southwest of Minneapolis My girlfriend and I decided to go for a walk around our apartment complex in Edina.  As we walked towards the swimming pool, she noticed a strange oval formation in the sky to the southwest (towards Savage, MN).  The sky was dark, but not yet dark enough where you couldn't still make out the clouds in the sky.  This stood out much more than the background clouds, appearing as a smoky white ring with at least six points of light, relatively evenly spaced around the ring. We looked at it for about five minutes or so, during this time it did appear to move, with the oval becoming thinner and then wider, it also appeared to slightly rotate. I was honestly quite awestruck looking at this, getting a feeling that this wasn't normal and didn't strike me as something that would be created by some sort of spotlights or some other ground, based light(s). Interestingly, it just sort of disappeared instead of fading away.   A few minutes later I spotted a light from a plane flying high above (I didn't feel it was connected to this phenomenon, this seemed to be a passenger plane), and its light disappeared behind the clouds.  My feeling is this ring of lights was cutting through the clouds, as the light was a sort of foggy light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights from local casino, we wonder??
