round, bright white light that changed into orange;2000-11-28 21:30:00;3 minutes;round, bright white light that changed into orange I was on my porch, which faces west and I saw a really bright star looking object in the distance, however it was much brighter than any star.  It rapidly came closer and I could see that it was round with many thin pieces sticking out of the object.  Twice it stopped and changed directions, and then continued on the orginal path.  When it was almost directly overhead, it began to change into an orange color and then back to the white.  When it changed color it did so gradually, and started in the center, and then worked it's way to the thin pieces that were attached to the circle. The thin pieces then began to flash orange and white.  Even though it was very close, it was silent.;44.8862166666667;-93.347625
