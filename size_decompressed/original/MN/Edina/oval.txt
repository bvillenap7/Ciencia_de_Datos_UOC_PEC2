My brother walks to his job at the hospital in Edina.  It was around 11:30, when he called and told me to look outside.  To the southwest, I saw this very wide oval of soft lights in the distance.  It stayed there for while till it faded for a second and reappeared just a few feet to the right.  (Distance of a foot compared to the sky.)  It faded again.  I dont know what the fuck I saw and I called everyone I could close to me but they live at least 30 minutes away from me, so I don't think the viewing was correct for them.  My brother saw it and so did I.   Freaking out right now.  I dont know what to thing about this. ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected advertising lights at a local casino.  PD));44.8862166666667;-93.347625
