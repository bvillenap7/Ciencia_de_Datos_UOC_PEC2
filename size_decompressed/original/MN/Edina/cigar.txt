As we were going down 212 and getting on highway 62, I saw something Iâ€™ll never forget.  It looked like a blimp but was lit up like a skyscraper.  It was gigantic.  It was in the Minneapolis area, around 2005, Did anyone seen something similar? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.8862166666667;-93.347625
