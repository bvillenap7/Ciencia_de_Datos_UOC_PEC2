Two college students witnessed this event. Two triangles, or triangle formations were seen traveling east to west in the northern sky. They apeared to be rotating and traveled at high velocity. As they approached the west the lights seemed to get closer to eachother at a constant rate, perhaps this is due to the distance traveled.;44.3331;-93.9845
