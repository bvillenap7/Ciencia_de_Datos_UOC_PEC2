Older sister and I witnessed 3 orange, glowing, bell shaped shaped objects in northern sky. No sound.;1982-10-31 18:30:00;1 minute;Older sister and I witnessed 3 orange, glowing, bell shaped shaped objects in northern sky.  No sound. I have a very vivid memory during my childhood of an occurrence in the early 80’s. I remember the date OCT 31, Halloween (1982 or 83), because at the time it was an important holiday for a child age 7-8.  Within 5 minutes of leaving my house (6:30 pm) to get an early start on “trick or treating”, I noticed what appeared to be 3 orange balloons in the northern sky above a field.  I told my sister, who’s 2 yrs. my senior, to “ look at the orange Halloween balloons”.  Upon second glance, they came into sharp focus as 3 bright orange, glowing, bell-shaped objects approx. 1 mile north of our location heading east at a medium-slow speed. These were not balloons by any means, but glowing, mechanical, craft not like anything military or commercial.  After discussing this with my sister, we agreed these were something extraordinary.  Based on the speed and direction we looked up at the sky where they should’ve been and they were completely gone.  Vanished. I have not seen anything similar before or after that event, but I still discuss it with her every few years.  Had I saw it only by myself at that age, I may have disregarded it as an illusion.  But the fact that my older sister was there to witness it and still testify it as fact, makes me realize what we saw was a group of UFO’s.
