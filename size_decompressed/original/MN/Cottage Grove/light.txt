Craft with two white lights in Minneapolis Approach Pattern that moved down and not forward then disappered behind the tree line.;2010-10-11 19:40:00;3-4 Minutes;Craft with two white lights in Minneapolis Approach Pattern that moved down and not forward then disappered behind the tree line. We were just finishing eating dinner when I saw a strange formation of lights out the window.  I have aspirations to become an aerospace engineer and pilot and know alot about aviation so I can recognize my aircraft.  This craft was totally out of the Minneapolis approah pattern and was fairly large looking.  It consisted of simply two bright white lights that blinked in a few second intervals.  The craft was directly in the KMSP approach pattern and was high above the houses at first.  After just a few seconds the two lights dropped down fast until they went below the trees and houses just behind our house.  I know that this was not an aircraft as it made no noise and had no other lights besides these two lights.  It also moved down without moving forward.   After it was no longer visible I went down to our computer and went to liveatc.net, there I tuned Minneapolis approach and listened a while until I heard a transmission to a Compass Airways jet telling it to take caution in a certain zone of the approach.   I then looked up that zone in my FAA Minnesota Aviation Charts book and saw that it happened to be near where I saw the craft.   I also just a few minutes later heard them telling the planes to look for a certain traffic that I either missed the name of or they didn't know what it was.   All this seems to point to a UFO in our area on 10/11/10 that was near the KMSP approach pattern.;44.8306;-92.9393
