Four fireballs over eastern Minnesota.;2013-08-16 22:30:00;15 minutes;Four fireballs over eastern Minnesota On Friday August 16th between 10:30pm and 10:45pm I spotted what appeared to be 4 large fireballs moving from SE to NW for several minutes, the first two were about 4 minutes apart with the 3rd not far behind the 2nd and then a 4th approx.  4 minutes after them.  They appeared to be 10 to 20 miles to the east and just before they disappeared, they seemed to change trajectory to the north.  There was no noise that I could tell.  I had been taking pictures of the moon earlier in the evening with my Sony A58 DSLR and the sky was clear.  I managed to get 2 photos of the last object.  My wife, son & daughter also saw these.  I’m an amateur astronomer and photographer and a plane buff and I’ve never seen anything like this in my life.  My first thoughts were F16’s returning to Duluth with afterburners on but the objects did not gain speed and were visible for minutes.  They appeared to be approx. 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon and there were planes departing M! SP visible and making noise higher in the sky.  These objects appeared to be approx. ¼ inch in size at an arm’s length and travelled the same direction.  Their speed was the same and I’d guess at around 250 to 300 MPH give or take, but hard to really judge not knowing the exact distance away.  It has me puzzled.  Note: I saw similar reports on the Wisconsin page like this around the same date and time.;44.8306;-92.9393
