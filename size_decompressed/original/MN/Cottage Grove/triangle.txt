On my way home from work early Sunday morning I noticed some bright lights just above the trees.  I thought it was for a ball field but I'd never seen them there before.  As I got closer I realized they were too high up to be attached to the ground but they appeared to be stationary.  I was only a few blocks from home and it was hard to tell if it was moving until I stopped for a stop sign.  It was hovering slowly and very low.  When I reached my driveway and turned my engine off I could hear a low hum.  It was right above my backyard, big black triangle shaped with three lights I watched for a few more minutes as it slowly traveled north.;44.8306;-92.9393
