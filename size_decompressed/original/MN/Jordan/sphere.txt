As we were approaching the intersection, I notice 4 very bright lights - in a pair above the treeline in the west.   I didn't know what they were and my boyfriend thought they must be tower lights of somekind.  I was not aware of any toweres being built there, but thought it might be a reasonable conclusion.   As time went on, I thought they were moving to the east and toward us and the town.  At that point, we thought they might be military planes as there is a strip in the area somewhere.  But, I felt these craft were too big to be military planes.  However, it was dark and so one couldn't see much but the lights.   As we passed through the interestion, I continued to watch and noticed the lights on the craft.  I felt they were not the usual lighting of commercial planes.  I am not that familiar with military planes, but the back lights did not seem to reflect that of tail lights - but a circular set of green lights (maybe 5).  There was at least one red blinking light.  We turned around to get a better look while the crafts were flying over the Hwy.  We thought we would be able to get a good look because they seemed to move slowly.  But, as we turned around, we were not able to see much else at a close range.  They were at a low altitude like military planes, but we did not hear any loud engine sounds like I have heard in the past.  I guess I didn't think that much about it because we were in a car and may not have been able to hear a noise like that.   I think the biggest thing that stands out is that the wing span of the bright 2 lights (left and right) seemed way too wide for a plane and most of all, I have not seen green lights like that before on a plane.  I have seen lots of military planes in the area and this did not seem to be like what I had seen before.

I go to school in Mankato which is south of Jordan. I foten see C-130s flying one after the other heading north following 169. ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the source for providing explanation.
