Large lights;2007-01-20 21:01:00;20 seconds;I was in my bed reading when I heard a large noise above my house. I quickly put my book down and rushed to the window. When I looked outside I saw large lights flying over my house. The lights were both white and red. I watched it fly over the highway and then out of sight. It looked to be about 50 feet off the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));44.6713;-93.6195
