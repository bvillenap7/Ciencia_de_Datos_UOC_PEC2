Then we saw about 8 white small (maybe round drone shaped?) aircrafts flying very high and very close.   First we thought it was weird for white birds to be flying in formation and so high.  Then we saw them descending rapidly in formation and with bright lights facing us.   Suddenly, they change direction and disappear.   They all re-appeared and repeated same process again.  Disappeared and I'm not going away until I see them again;44.6713;-93.6195
