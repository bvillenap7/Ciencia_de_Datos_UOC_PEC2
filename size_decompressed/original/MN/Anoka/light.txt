VERY LARGE OBJECT- WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATING MY BACK YARD HOVERING ABOVE THE TREE LINE IN MY BACK YARD  BACK YARD;1976-06-30 21:00:00;5 minutes;VERY LARGE OBJECT- WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATING MY BACK YARD HOVERING ABOVE THE TREE LINE IN MY BACK YARD  BACK YARD I WAS APPROX 15-YRS OLD THE YEAR WAS 1976. I DO NOT REMEMBER THE EXACT DATE. I DO NOT REMEMBER THE EXACT TIME ... IT WAS BETWEEN 8:PM-10:PM (I KNOW IT WAS DARK OUT AND RIGHT BEFORE MY BED TIME) MY FAMILY AND I LIVED OUT IN THE COUNTRY 9- MILES FROM THE TOWN OF ANOKA, MN.  WE WERE ALL WATCHING TELEVISION IN THE FRONT LIVING ROOM WHICH FACED DUE WEST. AS I ENTERED MY BEDROOM (LOCATED ON THE SOUTH EAST SIDE OF HOUSE) I NOTICED FROM MY BEDROOM WINDOW, A VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT HOVERING ABOVE THE TREE LINE IN MY BACK YARD.  (TREE LINE APPROX 50- YARDS DUE EAST FROM HOUSE) THE OBJECT WAS VERY LARGE AND OVAL IN SHAPE.  I DIDN'T HEAR ANY NOISE COMING FROM THE OBJECT.  I WAS SO SCARED THAT I COULDN'T SPEAK OR MOVE. THE HAIRS ON MY ARMS WERE STANDING STRAIGHT UP, AS THEY ARE DOING NOW AS I AM  RELATING  THIS EXPERIENCE. THE BRIGHT LIGHT HOVERED IN AN UP AND DOWN MOTION FOR APPROX 5- MINUTES JUST ABOVE THE TREE LINE. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE OBJECT TOOK OFF INTO SPACE IN A SLANT MOTION (SOUTH EAST) AND WITHIN SECONDS THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED. I KNOW WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AT THAT TIME THERE IS NOTHING ON THIS EART THAT IS MAN MADE THAT CAN MOVE OR HOVER IN AN UP AND DOWN MOTION WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND, NOR ANYTHING THAT CAN MOVE SO FAST AND DISAPPEAR INTO SPACE WITHIN SECONDS.;45.2815;-93.4195

I seen this perfectly round, super bright white ball and round like a marble.  ((anonymous report));2017-02-11 21:50:00;20 seconds;On the late night of February 11th (I think this was the night.), I was arranging our vehicles in drive way.  And as I was on my way back into the house, I looked up into very clear sky to admire how bright the sky looked that night. I stood there for about five minutes, browsing the sky, when I seen this perfectly round, super bright white ball and round like a marble that had no noise....no blinking lights....no trail debris like comets, asteroids, planes or space debris leave behind. I needed to get an approximate size.  To get a more accurate size of UFO I held up my fingers on my right hand very quickly because the UFO was travelling extremely fast..  My pinky finger at arms length matched the size of the UFO. The bright moving UFO passed from over our home from a northwest direction in a perfectly straight line to the southeast. It was difficult to determine altitude.  I'd take a guess and say higher than most man made aircraft. The event only lasted about twenty too thirty seconds.   I never forget the experience.  I tell people, and they think I'm making up the whole UFO experience.  I know what I've seen up in the heavens.  We're not allown.
