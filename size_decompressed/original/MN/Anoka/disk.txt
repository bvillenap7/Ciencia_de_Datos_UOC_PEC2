Huge and silent;2012-01-15 08:30:00;20 seconds;Huge and silent I was coming back from the gas station and when I was driving by the park I noticed a light up in the air. This is a park I drive by on a regular basis.  I immediately knew something was out of place. There was a light, not very bright but it caught my attention.  It was to my left at about fifty feet or so high. It was turning from right to left.  When it was almost even with me it bobbed slightly up and down. That was when I noticed the size of the disc.  It was black yet silver at the same time.  I couldnt see the top but the bottom was slightly rounded.  It pretty much covered the park from my right to left.  I had stopped by this point and gotten out of my truck.  It bobbed again then bobbed again.  It was enormous.  It then shot straight up so fast it dissapeared.  There was no noise at all.  No sound of wind rushing past it as it shot up nothing.;45.2815;-93.4195
