I was on my break at work and sitting out in my car, with the sunroof open. I had my seat back and i was watching the sky. About 20 minutes had passed when, from my left, i saw a triangular object flying overhead. The lights on it were a faint orange, like nothing i had ever seen before. It was silent and flying very fast. Only lasted a few seconds. The object was very low as well. I couldnt believe what i was seeing but it couldnt be mistaken for anything other than what I had described above. After a few seconds, it had traveled into the treeline and i could see it no longer.;45.2815;-93.4195
