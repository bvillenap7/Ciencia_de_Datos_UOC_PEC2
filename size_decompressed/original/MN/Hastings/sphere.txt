Black half sphere with wagon wheel shaped light pattern visible when directly over head.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-04 21:40:00;3 minutes;Black half sphere with wagon wheel shaped light pattern visible when directly over head. Started as a solid light moving South to North, straight at me, high in the air, but could not tell how high.  As light got closer, a black half sphere was above the light, but no wings on the sides.  When directly over me, the single light had additional dots of lights surrounding it, with lines of light connecting them, like an old wagon wheel.  I could not see any black body extending out from the light in any direction.  When it passed over me a bit, the light went back to a single light and the same black sphere above it could be visible again.  When it left my sight, turned around and a second identical object, identical light, identical height, speed, path, everything identical, went overhead.
