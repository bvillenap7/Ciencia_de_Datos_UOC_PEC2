I know I sound totally crazy but my brother who is 23, knocked on my bedroom door and told my fiance that there was a UFO outside.   So myself, fiance, and my brother went outside to where my brother's girlfriend was in our backyard.  If you looked north north-east, there was an object that had lights going kind of around it.  It wasn't a plane because it didn't travel fast enough.  And it's not a satellite because it moved too much.   It appeared to have a reddish kind of light going around the outside of a blueish light.  It's really hard to describe!  We actually called the police department and all the commotion woke up my mom.  We are all pretty rational and we also believe in paranormal type things.  But this is the first time we have ever felt the need to actually report something.   Please get back to me if possible!  Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  Not the ISS.  PD));44.7126;-92.8589999999999
Bright, fast moving, blinking lights up in the sky over Hastings, Minnesota on August 5, 2012 at 10:20 pm.;2012-08-05 22:20:00;15 minutes;bright, fast moving, blinking lights up in the sky over Hastings, Minnesota on August 5, 2012 at 10:20pm Just got out of work and was heading to get something to eat. Seen 3 bright, blinking lights off to my right in the sky. To my left there was another bright, blinking light.  Quicker then I could follow, the lights moved their positions.  Then I seen five bright, blinking lights in a row, up in the sky, in front of me. As quickly as they formed this line, they moved again.   When I got to the diner and met up with my co worker that was joining me, she too had seen the bright, blinking lights up in the sky.  We were both blown away and neither of us could believe what we had seen. It was not a plane nor was it stars.  It was something neither I nor my co worker had ever seen before.;44.7126;-92.8589999999999

We see what we first thought was a plane.  But it looked out of place. Only bright forward light.  No blinking, red, or green.  Just a mellow glow.  Both nights at about 9:30 pm on the 7th and the 8th of August 2016.  As they went slowly through the sky, left to right, seeming to pass towards Prescott, Wisconsin.  Then a quick fiery red glow, they zipped upwards and away.. exciting!!;44.7126;-92.8589999999999

I have never seen anything like this before.  I recorded video of the object.  My wife took my phone, just to make sure that it wasn't me shaking or moving the phone.  We observed the object for about 45 minutes.  It would move higher and lower in the sky, but keep moving at impossible angles.  We witnessed the object in the western sky around 270 degrees and it was 15 to 20 degrees from the horizon.;44.7126;-92.8589999999999
