Three people see orange spherical UFO over Eveleth, MN.;2011-07-01 21:00:00;3 or 4 minutes;Three people see orange spherical UFO over Eveleth, MN. On or about July 1st at about 2100 hrs. I was sitting in the smoking area of St Raphaels nursing home in Eveleth, MN.  I was looking in a sotherly direction when I caught something off to my right.  I watched it for a few seconds and asked one of the other witnesses if they saw what I was looking at.  She didn't believe me at first, then she looked and asked me what it was and I replied I had no idea.  She and I watche it for about 30 seconds and asked the other witness if she saw it.  She thought we were pulling her leg until she looked and saw it also. We continued watching it for about 3 more minutes until it disappeared behind a taller part of the building.  The object was spherical in shape, orange in color,emitted no sound, and left no trail.  It moved from south to north at a relatively slow speed.  My two witnesses are both LPN's, and I am a member of Mensa.  None of us could figure out what it was.;47.4507;-92.5291
