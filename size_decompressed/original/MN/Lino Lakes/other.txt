So, I looked back at the other wall, and thought, Since when does an airplane have a huge glowing yellow light across it and three glowing blue lights?, so I looked again and sure enough it was still there, flying to low to be an airplane, but moving at a moderate speed, making a low soothing humming sound.  By my window there are no streets at all, and this was up in the sky.  I saw it go behind some trees, and I saw it fully again.  I rushed to the kitchen to get my camera phone, but I didn't look and the door was shut, so I ran into it.  I ran back to the window to see if it was still there, but it was gone.
