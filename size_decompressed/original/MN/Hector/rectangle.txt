About the time I got to Stewart, my passengers and I saw a blue light coming out of the sky in a large beam.  One of my passengers thought it was a tornado, but it wasn’t moving. It was about 10:00 pm on April 21, 2013.  It was very dark, except for this bright blue beam.  As we approached Hector, we realized that the beam was right above that town.  I wondered if the high school had one of those big spot lights on, but as I turned off of the highway into a dark Hector neighborhood, I realized that wasn’t what it was. My passengers and I got out of the vehicle and realized we were standing in the blue light.  It was dispersed all around us and we all started to look up in the sky to see where it was originating from.  There was a lot of cloud cover, but as the clouds moved a black rectangle appeared above us and glided to the right and then back.  It was a perfect rectangle and completely devoid of any light.  We all were a little intrigued, and scared.  I tried to take a snapshot, but my camera wouldn’t work. We all saw the same thing, and there was no explanation for this.  About a week later, a family member of mine told me that something unexplained broke a utility pole at the very tip.  Something flying perhaps?
