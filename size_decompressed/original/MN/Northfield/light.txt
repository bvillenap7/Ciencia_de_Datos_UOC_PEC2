I was outside playing tennis with overcast skies and slight rain, when I saw a large round light in the sky.  The light started out as bright white and turned a light green, then quickly turned pink.   I watched the light for about 20 seconds then turned to my friends and said, Hey guys, look at this!  I pointed to the sky where the light no longer was.   I looked all around the sky but unfortunately found nothing.;44.4612000000001;-93.1671999999999
