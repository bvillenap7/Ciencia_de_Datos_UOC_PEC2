Pulsating fireball hovering above tree line;2011-07-01 21:30:00;1 min;Pulsating fireball hovering above tree line I was looking out the window and a bizarre object hovering just above the treeline caught my eye.  It was motionless, hanging in the sky. It looked like a oval shaped fireball that pulsated with a white/red light.  It was much brighter than an aircraft and did not act like one.   This object moved a little to the east then disappeared for a few moments until it reappeared over Interstate 35.  It hovered there for a few moments then the light disappeared. It had just rained and there was significant cloud cover and lightning in the area.  It didn't look or act like any sort of firework I've seen, especially considering the duration of the event and the fact that it hovered, soundless, for a few minutes. For the most part, it stayed right above the tree line at an unknown distance away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
