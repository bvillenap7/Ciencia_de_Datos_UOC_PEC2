Object was chevron with one bend schorter than the other.  The edge looked liked ribed, color alternated in stipes lengthwise between the ribs black and gray. It was scilent and very low, maybe 100 or 200 feet. I got a good look at it, it seemed to be circling, comming back around every ten minutes or so. I haven't seen it since and there hasn't been anything around even close to it since. It might have stayed their all night, I had to go.
