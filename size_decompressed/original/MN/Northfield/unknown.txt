I will be honest, I had a couple to drink, but two of the other three were sober. I was staring into the west night sky when I saw a very dark shape with two lights in the front section, which were solid spots, and two whitish, almost rope light lights on the tail this thing flew completely silent. I sat up and said holy sh!t a UFO!! my cousins turned around and looked into the sky, as they saw it, we all stood up and were hysterical over the occurance. My cousins and I all saw the same thing, and it seemed like it was a triangle shape. As I was watching it fly from the SW to the NE, I attempted to take a picture with my phone. I looked at the phone to find out the screen was black. I watched it fly over a line of trees and disappear from my sight, and my cousins turned toward me and each other and asked where did it go? I told them it went behind the trees, so we moved about 20 feet to be able to see it again, but it was to no avail. Now today as I write this, I have a strange pattern of red circles on my back that I do not know whether or not are related to the sighting, but the circles are about half inch in diameter, and are extremely consistent and in almost a waffle iron pattern. They are not raised and there is no irritation on my skin. I had my wife take a picture of them so I can relay them to my friend in the NSA one day.
