3 red/orange glowing balls flying in a line.;2015-07-08 22:00:00;5 minutes;3 red/orange glowing balls flying in a line. I was standing outside.  Noticed a red/orange glowing ball moving north towards me.  Wasn't a plane.   I kept watching trying to figure out what it was.   When that ine passed over the trees another came from the south and when that one passed over the trees, one more was behind it.  They were following each other in a straight line.;44.0438;-92.631
