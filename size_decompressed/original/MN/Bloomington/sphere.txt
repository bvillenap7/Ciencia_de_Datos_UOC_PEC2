I saw the jet, as it passed I saw two round white objects I thought were birds I stopped my bike to look.  They both were intertwining with each other in a circular fashion, then they would move apart a little, then intertwine again as they moved south west.  After a few seconds of watching,  One object dimmed and then turned silver, and then disappeared.  The other object went very fast to the west for a second then almost stopped and then just drifted off to the west, it did disappear at one point then reappeared. I then lost sight of it.  By the way these objects were not near the jet they were probably a mile or so closer to me that the jet.;44.8322444444444;-93.3063333333333
Bright sphere sitting still in sky, after 3 seconds it moved impossibly fast vertically, down behind horizon.;2011-09-15 02:00:00;5 Seconds;Bright sphere sitting still in sky, after 3 seconds it moved impossibly fast vertically, down behind horizon. At 2:00 am, on Thursday, September 15, while driving North on France from Old Shakopee Road, spotted a bright spherical object in the sky.  It did not move for about three seconds, then it flew vertically down behind the horizon line.  The original position of the sphere was high in the sky, the time it took to disappear behind the horizon was less than half a second.  It was incredibly fast. It left no trail. A friend who was driving in a car about five car lengths in front of me saw the object as well and described it the same way.;44.8322444444444;-93.3063333333333
Several blue and white orbs hovering just south of the airport.;2013-10-13 00:00:00;several minutes;several blue and white orbs hovering just south of the airport. Was driving north down 12th ave to the super america on 90th when I noticed several blue and white orbs hovering about a 1000 feet or more in the sky.  Looked like they were above 77 but perhaps further east.   At first glance I told myself they were stars but realized they were far too low and the more I studied them I began to observe some move.  They were scattered in formation but grouped in the same general area.  I had a previous sighting Aug 2012 of a dozen orange orbs flying in formation north over 35w.  Past right over my car.  I'm surprised nothing has been on the news!  What are these orbs and what do they want?  Military or other?  These sightings have changed me forever.
