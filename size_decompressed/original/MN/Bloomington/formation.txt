he noticed two white dots (not moving and there wasn't any stars out yet) spaced about two miles apart.  ((anonymous report));2018-05-27 20:35:00;15min;me and my friend usually smoke inside the garage but since it gets so hot in the garage we decided to smoke outside clear sky.  There he noticed two white dots (not moving and there wasn't any stars out yet) spaced about two miles apart and up high. blinking white lights kind of positioned like a stop light on the two  dots.  then was another slightly lower than the other two that I noticed because the light was red and there isn't a power place near by so it was weird to see that red light there...the lights were kind of in a formation.  Just the one that was closer to the ground seemed like it was surveillance I don't know for who or what but definitely a weird feeling.  Not quite sure how long the lights were there but we were outside for about 15min.  And a half hour later they were gone when we went back out again.

Band of UFO's flying across the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of cluster of Space Link satellites??  PD))((anonymous));2019-05-25 00:06:00;1 minute;Band of UFO's flying across the night sky. Many UFO's spotted flying from South SW to North NE in a straight line. 100+ white dots with no tail or trail were less concentrated and even few and far between at the head and tail.  Very concentrated in a perfectly straight band all the same size and luminosity.  We could not determine the distance of items and there was no breaking or burning noticed as they flew across the entire sky.  Took about 2 minutes to fly across they sky.  This was right over the Mall of America.  My dad and I were mesmerized by the objects as they looked like a fleet.  The last few objects were noticed to be following far behind but were traveling the exact same speed as the rest of the objects.  I have a picture of this but it's not high quality.
