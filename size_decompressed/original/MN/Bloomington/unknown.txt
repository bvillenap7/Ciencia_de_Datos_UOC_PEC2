It was a low humming sound accompanied by a repetitive rapping/banging sound.  For lack of a better comparison, it sounded like a Harley-Davidson flying over our house at about 50 miles per hour, and it was much different than the sound of a helicopter as there was a sort of deep, clunking sound at the rate of 5-10 per second.  As the first object passed there was another one that followed a few seconds later, as if one UFO was following closely behind the other.  We had gotten 13 inches of snow that night so vehicles were non-existent.  I woke up immediately thinking UFO as the sounds were so foreign to me and they were traveling over our house in a path perpendicular to the road.  My wife thought it was a snow plow at the time, but woke up realizing the plows hadn't gone through at all yet, and didn't until 7:30 AM.  I'm convinced this was a UFO and am curious to learn if anybody el! se heard anything that night, or better yet saw something.;44.8322444444444;-93.3063333333333

Closer than airplanes fly in formation. I was walking down a street and looked south and saw two lights traveling together from West to East.  They were at about 35* and seemed closer than two planes would travel together.  They were red.  They were moving a little slower than youâ€™d expect a plane to move.   I forgot about them then saw an email from a fellow co-worker at MSP airport who sent an email to our co-workers at the airport asking about the two lights flying across the sky.  Did anyone have information on them?   She received no responses but mine.;44.8322444444444;-93.3063333333333
