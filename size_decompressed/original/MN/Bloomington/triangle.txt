But tonight it came closer and we could see three lights in the shape of a triangle.  It circled our house for awhile.  It seemed to hide on the horizon and when I went outside to let the dog in from the backyard it came up towards me.  I didn't hear a sound the whole time.  We live right by the main international airport and we also live by the military base.  Is this a new aircraft they are trying?  It hovers!  It sits in one place for a while (3 minutes, 15 minutes, hours...  then with no warning it flys.  It flys like an airplane, but I get the sense that it, or they can see me because it reacts to me when I go out of doors!  Very strange!  Have seen similar triangular lights following jet contrails in the sky throughout the summer!  I pulled my husband out twice to look because I didn't want to think I was seeing something that could be explained away as a regular aircraft.  The oddest thing about this experience was that there was no sound at all the whole time!;44.8322444444444;-93.3063333333333

P;2009-01-23 07:15:00;20 minutess;I was driving on a highly used freeway across a bridge.  I Don't remember much, I just remember feeling like this doesn't seem normal.  Planes don't just stay still.  The first one i saw was right over my head and did NOT look like a plane.  It had odd bright lights on it.  Driving further down i saw another formation of lights further away.  I had seen three bright pulsing lights in formation of a large triangle.  One car ahead of me had pulled over to get a better look so i decided to do the same.  Unfortunately, when I pulled over, it was out of sight.  I arrived home and thought about going across the bridge again to see if i could get a better look.  So i did, but i didn't see the same things,just planes.  I called several friends but they just made fun of me.  But one of my friends was actually driving too about an hour after i did and noticed the same things.  A part of me logically says they were just planes, but another part of me says that it was more than that. never seen anything like it ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
