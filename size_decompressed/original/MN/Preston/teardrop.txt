We all tried to debunk it as a star or a police helicopter but it was moving which told us it wasn't a star plus it flashed different colors also telling us it wasn't a star.  We could tell it wasn't a helicopter due to it moving to fast.  And for a short time it seemed as if it was hovering over a field almost searching for something.  As we left Preston it started following us, shortly after it all of the sudden vanished.  We haven't seen it since.;43.6649;-92.1001
