We slowed down and then stopped along side the highway about one half mile after initally spotting the light to get a better look. The light was a steady red color like the top light on the communications tower except there were fainter secondary lights. The unknown light was somewhat further from the highway and appeared to be about twice as big. Upon stopping and watching for a few seconds the object accelerated incredibly fast to the South at very high rate of speed changing from a steady red to a blinking orange light with dimmer secondary lights of red and white. The object traveled a distance of two or three miles in a matter of a few seconds and shortly after disappeared from sight.;47.1521;-92.4352
