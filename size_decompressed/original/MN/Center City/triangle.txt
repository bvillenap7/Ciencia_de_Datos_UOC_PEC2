As we were driving we noticed three triangular shaped objects, the best description I can give is upside down letter V shaped.  The objects were flying in a perfect shape of a triangle, the middle one slightly higher than the other two.  We brushed them off as planes and continued driving.  About 30 seconds later the three objects seemed to have moved hundreds of miles in seconds and were now directly behind the car and what seemed as only a few miles up in the sky.  They were a steely gray color, no lights.  We all three turned around and were terrified as the objects seemed to be getting closer.  We drove as fast as we could (80mph down an old gravel road) the remaining mile to our house.  When we reached the house the objects were still in the sky and seemed to have followed us.  We ran into the house to tell our parents.  When we came back outside the objects had seemi! ngly disappeared.
