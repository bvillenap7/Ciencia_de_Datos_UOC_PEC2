spinning object with red blue lights over red lake;2010-08-02 01:00:00;1hr 20 min;spinning object with red blue lights over red lake I was outside smokin a cigarette my girlfriend told me to look at the stars and i noticed somthing sitting in the same spot but spinning above red lake. it had red and blue lights u could tell it was spinning because the lights were moving.it stayed in that same spot slightly moving from side to side.we watched it for about twenty mins then relized we should show somebody so we could have wittnesses ,when i got four more people that were up they all seen it to then it startded moving more to the north for about five mins then went back to its original spot.the four people i brought out to see it all said its always showing up over the lake so its just normal to them. it showed up agaian two other times and now i know why it was just normal to them cuz i seen it three times now but it looks like im the only one to ever report anything from red lake but i know al least ten other people that have seen similar events . i am confident if someone sat out there wit! h a camera they would catch it again.;47.8647;-95.0629
