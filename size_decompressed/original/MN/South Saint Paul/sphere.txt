On September 20th at about 9:45 PM in South St. Paul, Minnesota, I witnessed what I would describe as two dimly lit reddish orbs traveling from north to south at a moderate speed.  They looked to be about the size of my index fingernail, held at armâ€™s length.   I would estimate their altitude at 600 feet above the Mississippi River Basin, as I was on a bluff looking east over the river.  Their angle above the horizon was near 15 degrees.  Also, they seemed to tumble over each other as if they were linked somehow.   About 45 seconds elapsed from the time I first saw them until the objects went out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious, and sober-minded.  PD));44.8838;-93.0531
