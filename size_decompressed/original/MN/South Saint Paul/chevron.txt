Unbelivable sight especially as a young kid. I was 3.5 years old and my Mom and dad and my brother and sister seen a UFO hovering above a duplex across the street with no noise and some how missed the power lines that are in the alley on 1st avenue South and 2nd avenue South and on the house. The UFO had bright lights and I think it was turning or the lights would change brightness or something. White Lights. The house it was above is a tall brown duplex that was seperated bye upstairs and downstairs apartments. My dad and brother actually got into the car and followed it and it disappered between 2nd and 3rd avenue South next to the church. I remember it disappering in the sky.  I figured someone else had to see this amazing sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.8838;-93.0531
