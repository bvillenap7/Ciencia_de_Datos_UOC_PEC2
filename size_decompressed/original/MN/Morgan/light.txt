On our way back to Morgan at around 10:30 PM, the sun was down and all of the stars were out I was looking out the window watching for shooting stars and this yellow light that looked like a star but much closer was just sitting there.   I told my mom who I was with to pull over and see what it was, no rush to get home we pulled over and watching it for about 1 minute then the light would move around or in a zig zag motion.   Still watching this light, it would hesitate for a couple seconds and move around some more.  Then a few seconds later it looked like it went up and changed from a light to a dark reddish and finally disappearing.   Having no light pollution being out in the country you could see the light clear as day light.  Thinking it over that it didn't blink and it wasn't high enough to be a satellite or airplane, any sort of aircraft even we thought it was a UFO.  There has been many other sightings around the Redwood county area at night of little lights zig zagging across the sky, not in a wide range but just around one area.;44.3926;-94.9218
