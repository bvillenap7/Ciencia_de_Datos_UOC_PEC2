I looked out my window as I was in bed and noticed a cluster of tiny lights in the sky. I thought at first that it was an airplane but the cluster didn't move. I watched diligently for about a half hour before falling asleep. The lights shimmered slightly and stayed in the irregular shaped formation. At 2:30 A.M. I awoke and checked the area in the sky. The cluster had disappeared. This was a very clear night I have seen reflections from satellites and man made objects in space but this did not appear like those. I couldn't estimate a distance but it looked like tiny stars. The shimmering lights reminded me of looking through an astronimic telescope and seeing the atmospheric shimmering effect. I am a retired Industrial Designer, of sound mind, and always interested in details. This is the only sighting I have witnessed of a supposed anomaly in space.;43.9937;-94.6207
