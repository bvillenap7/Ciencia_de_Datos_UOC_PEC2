Was it childhood imagination or real?;1978-06-15 18:00:00;10 minutes;Was it childhood imagination or real? I was 11, and on the deck of our home playing with toys when I noticed a spot in the sky that was becoming bigger. There was no sound. It was quickly above my home. A rounded triangular shape that hovered above my home, almost as if it knew that I had seen it. I yelled for my grandmother to come out and see it, though I was paralized with fear. She was washing dishes and thought I was seeing a low flying jet but I knew that jets just didn't hover and were not as huge. I watched the objet move over an island on the lake that we lived on. It paused over that land and then went off into space in a blink. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));45.4555;-93.5844000000001
