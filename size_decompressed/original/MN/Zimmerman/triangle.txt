I had just been dropped off by a freind after going to perkins after a concert, and i was hanging out outside because the moon was really bright and pretty.  we have chairs out by our detatched garage, and they face east.  I sat out for a few minutes, but decided to go in because of the cold MN temperatures.  On my way back into the house, i noticed a brightness coming from behind me.  I thought it may have been my neighbor's motion-activated floodlights, but when i turned around, the lights were off.  The neighbor to the east's horses were also riled up.  i coudl hear them running around and making noise.  When i brought my eyes to the sky, i saw two triangular shaped glowing objects.  there was definately light coming from them, but not from any specific source.  It was more as if the craft itself emitted the glow.  They zoomed southward across the sky, encircling each other, then zoomed  away further into the east.  They were not so much a color as they were a light.  But if there is any color they'd be, i'd say a silver, blueish color.  i can't say for sure how big they were, seeing as they were far away.  Definately bigger than any car or bus, though, i'd say.  And maybe it was because i was so fixated on them, but for some reason, when i saw them, the cold air seemed to dissappear.;45.4555;-93.5844000000001
