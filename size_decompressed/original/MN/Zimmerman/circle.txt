This object was first observed as a orange lighted object in the sky.  Once overhead the witnesses observed this object had a lighted circle around the orange light as it passed over in the sky. This object wasn’t recognized as a satellite or airplane overhead.  This object moved through the sky without any sound in any way.  In addition there wasn’t blinking lights to be seen, which is usual with most commercial aircraft.  This object moved through the sky with little effort quickly.  As it moved through the sky it had a straight  path of North to South.;45.4555;-93.5844000000001

I looked into the sky from my window and saw a light pulsing, at first I thought it might a satellite but then it started to move erratically (full circles, side to side, up and down) after that it stayed in one general location.  Then just kept pulsing,  In a video I took it looks like it's pulling light to another UFO. And also, this is not my first experience.  I am available 3:00pm central time to 8:30pm central time.;45.4555;-93.5844000000001
