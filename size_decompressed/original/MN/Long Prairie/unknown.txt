My neighbors house is straight north from me and I heard this noise from north of his house which traveled east of his house to straight east of my house then change direction and go straight south of my house.  The beeping was loud for I could hear it inside my house.  And it sounded like a beacon beeping every second for like an hour then stopped and we haven't heard it since.  We checked where the noise could of been by driving near the location and all that was there was empty fields.;45.9744;-94.8691
