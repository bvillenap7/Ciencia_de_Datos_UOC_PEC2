At 3:30 hours, I went outside for a cigarette, while I was star gazing I noticed a bright light in the west northwest sky at about my one o'clock (I was facing west).  It's intensity was a little bit brighter than that of Venus.  It moved from the west northwest to the east southeast at a steady pace.   I looked very carefully for strobing lights like an airplane would have even using my hand to block out street lights.  There were not any strobe light that I could see.   This is a quiet little town and as such I would normally have been able to hear the light rumble of jet engines, but there was none.  Nor were there any visible contrails behind it although there was not a moon in the sky at the time.  It reminded me of a satellite crossing the sky except the fact that satellites travel from south to north here (at least the ones I've ever seen here).   I watched it till it was out of sight and then came in to make this report.;45.1293;-94.5275999999999

Ther;2017-08-10 20:47:00;3-4 minutes;My daughter and I were outside when I noticed a bright light in the western sky, just above the tree line, moving from west to east.  There were no visible blinking lights on it.  As it moved we noticed very lite lights coming out of it a zipping away.  Unlike airplanes there was no sound.  This kept up until it was out of sight.  About 3-4 minutes.;45.1293;-94.5275999999999
