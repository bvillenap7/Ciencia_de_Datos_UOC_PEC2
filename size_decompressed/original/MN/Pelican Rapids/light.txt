Bright light disappears, reappears an hour later.;2015-08-08 21:00:00;2 minutes, twice;Bright light disappears, reappears an hour later. Driving home from work, myself & 2 others witnessed a bright light flying a bit lower in the sky than an airplane would.  It was a light.  Brighter than an airplane.  I commented on it's brightness.   Continued driving, looked up about 1 min later & that big bright light was GONE.  It was not behind any cloud or anywhere else in the visible sky.  An airplane wouldn't be able to fly that distance that quickly.  We had a good view of the sky, with a view of a few miles down the road.  It was dusk when we saw it, around 9:10 pm on 08/08/15.  The light was in the southeast portion of the sky.  All three of us had seen it & we all noticed it's extremely fast departure. About a half hour later, I & one passanger (we had dropped off 1 in town) a saw a bright light either the exact same or very similar to the one we had seen earlier.  It was a bit south of where we had seen it before.  I eventually stoppied paying attention to it and do not remember seeing it as I drove home.;46.6011;-96.0688
