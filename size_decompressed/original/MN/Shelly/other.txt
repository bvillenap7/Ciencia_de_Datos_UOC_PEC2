They passed over me and took off up into the sky. My sister reports hearing her dogs barking madly. Went outside her home and looked to the Western sky. Noticed a pretty bluish white star in the sky. The star started moving slowly in her direction. It stopped,and a smaller red star dropped out of the bigger blue star. The bigger blue star continued moving towards her. Midway into her back yard it shot straight up into the sky and disappeared. She turned and watched the red one slowly start coming her way. She started backing up towards the light on her porch. The red star moved slowly towards her,kept moving,but even slower as it came over her. She heard a low humm coming from the red object only. She felt that she was being observed. She figured the hell with it(she has seen so many in her area)that she waved at the red star twice. On the second wave she stated bye,and it took off straight up towards the Southeast sky into a pinpoint and was gone. During this whole experience her dogs where barking uncontrollably. Once the objects were gone,the dogs stopped barking. She doesn't have access to a computer/Internet and requested I report this incendent to someone. Thank You For Your Time;47.4521;-96.784
