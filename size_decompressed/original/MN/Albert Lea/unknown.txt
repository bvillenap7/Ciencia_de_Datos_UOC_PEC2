We were west of the object.  She then noticed it moving back in the direction that it came from, but without making any turns like an airplane.  Then, she saw it move East and it went back in it's original direction which is North.  I saw it moving North after it did it's turns and it was moving very fast, faster than what an airliner or private plane would be able to go.  There were also no other planes in the vicinity.;43.6536999999999;-93.3707000000001
