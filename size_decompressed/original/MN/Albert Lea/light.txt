At approximately 3:25am, I noticed a light moving in the sky just south of where I was standing.  I observed it while it moved to the west of my position for approximately 5 minutes.  Then, the light changed direction to S. S.W. at a 45 degree angle.  Then the light dissapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.6536999999999;-93.3707000000001

They were at a diagonal from each other with the right light being slightly lower.  The angle reminded me of Orion's belt, but without the center star.  There were some stars also visible at the time, but they were much dimmer.  The two bright lights looked more like planets than stars.  They were at approximately a 35-40 degree angle from the ground.  As I continued look at the lights for 10-15 seconds, they did not move, flicker, flash, or change in any way.  They then faded away and were completely gone within 5 seconds.  The stars that were visible could still be seen.
