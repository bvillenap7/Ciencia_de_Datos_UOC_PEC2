3 unmoving bright flashes of light in the sky between big and little dipper, 5 times bigger than biggest star.;2005-07-30 22:30:00;10 Seconds;3 unmoving bright flashes of light in the sky between big and little dipper, 5 times bigger than biggest star. We were visiting our friends in a campground and sitting by the campfire, looking for Falling Stars, etc.   Suddenly we saw a flash, like a camera flash, 2 big flashes about 3 seconds apart and then a smaller flash.  It was in the sky and located near the center between the big and little dipper.    It was approx 5 times bigger than the biggest brightest star in the sky, and it never moved.  Just 3 flashes and then nothing.;45.1021;-94.3355
