At first I thought maybe they were lanterns someone had let go, but then we noticed them split into 3 more lights and then go into 2 triangle formations and changed direction and traveled west.  We also noticed how large they were to us for being up in the sky.  We pulled over to watch them for a few minutes until they just like faded away.  We seen a helicopter or something after that heading from the South but the lights were gone by the time it arrived near us.  Im not exactly sure what they were but they surely caught our attention.;44.0793999999998;-93.2188000000012
