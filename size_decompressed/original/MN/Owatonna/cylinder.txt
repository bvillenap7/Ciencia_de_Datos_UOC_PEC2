My friends and I were messing around on the golf course on the 4th of November when Joe looked up in the air and asked, what is that?   I said it's prolly just a plane but Klein said that it's not because his dad flies and he has gone with him to the airport to watch his flight.  We stared for about two minutes and they got brighter. They didn't look like they were moving but they were getting bigger and bigger.  It was a cylinder type craft as far as i could see.   This was on Brooktree Golf Course in Owatonna,MN.  About 11:30 at night. About 4 minutes later of the growing they kind of dissapeared. It was an odd occurance. We thought we could hear it shortly before dissapearing. I slight clapping noise with small buzzes beforehand.;44.0793999999998;-93.2188000000012
