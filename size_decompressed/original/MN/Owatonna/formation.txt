When they turned the formation was very close together.They were white like the stars except not as bright.;44.0793999999998;-93.2188000000012
Possible UFO/Plane Crash Near Owatonna Minnesota;2015-09-22 00:45:00;Few seconds;Possible UFO/Plane Crash Near Owatonna, Minnesota Was driving Eastward, when 3 distinct lights were noticed.  A very bright white light was what caught my attention first.  That's when I realized there were 2 more, red and green lights.   At first these lights struck me right away as if to be a plane crashing because of the speed of which the object(s) were moving from top of my windshield to ground level.  I initially searched to see if there were any plane crashes in the area at all.  The main part that struck me as a plane was the brightest light, the white, and then the green and red lights both on a side of the white one.  There was part tree cover and suburb cover that blocked my view of the potential crash site.   I also did not hear any boom of an explosion of any plane type of craft.   From what I could estimate from the trees and houses in the way, it seemed to be at least a few miles out, but not further than about 10.  I am also a night sky hobbyist and definitely know the difference between a meteor shooting across the sky and whatever this may have been.  I did drive to where I had estimated a crash site of the object.  Drove along many back roads within a few miles of my estimated crash site to find nothing but eerily empty gravel roads surrounding Eastern Owatonna North of Highway 14.;44.0793999999998;-93.2188000000012
