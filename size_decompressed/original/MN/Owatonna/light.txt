I let my dogs out around 11:15 ((p.m.)) and was just looking in the sky from my driveway when i saw a point of light in the southeast that was traveling towards the northeast.  what struck me as odd was that it would appear to start and stop as it made it's way across the sky. When it got to the northeast another point of light appeared to travel straight up and meet it.  It seemed like 10-15 seconds passed, then the one i originally saw went straight up as the other one went straight down.  I lost the second one in the trees, but the first one went up a short ways and then appeared to just stop again.  At that point i went in to get my husband who was watching tv and he came out and we both looked at where it was, but it was gone, nothing else was moving. Neither objects had any flashing lights, they were so far away just points of light. I could hear highway sounds, so maybe it had a sound but i couldn't distinguish one.

2 Star Like Objects slowly start to move across the sky then vanish;2008-10-27 22:20:00;2 Min;2 Star Like Objects slowly start to move across the sky then vanish My girlfriend and I looked up into north western sky and notice what looked to be 2 stars slowly start moving across the night sky.  They were in a formation and were not airplanes then in the blink of an eye they both vanished without a trace.   The sky was completely clear and we both know what airplanes and satellites look like and these were neither. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCT)) Yeah they appeared around 10:20 pm Central Time and started moving then disappeared around 10:24 pm they moved east then back west for a min then east at a faster rate and then they glowed brighter and vanished like just disappeared one second they were there then gone.

Appears in night sky same place for last 3 wks.  Could be “fixed” satellite but subtle fast movements are too quick.((anonymous report);2018-09-09 22:00:00;Constant;It appears in night sky same place for last 3 weeks.  Could be “fixed” satellite but subtle fast movements are too quick Almost in direct center of night sky west and south of “Big Dipper” bright light which seems to resemble a star but it moves faster in small distances (all directions) for 1-2 second intervals, than satellites passing by object. It is not “a wobble effect.” ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.0793999999998;-93.2188000000012
