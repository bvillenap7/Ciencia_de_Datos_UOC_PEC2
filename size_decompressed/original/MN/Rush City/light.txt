Driving down county road 7, I saw a strange red light that looked like a cellphone tower but it was in a spot where there wasn't any.  I pulled to the side of the road and it went from where I saw it to a few miles in the matter of a second.  It then started doing circles around 20 times then stopped.  It then zigzaged from rush point store to Cambridge within 5 seconds.;45.6822;-92.9633
