Not sure what it was but zigzaged slightly & hovered. Took several pictures Only saw one. About 10 minutes later noticed several aircraft flying around object, with one doing a summersault. All of a sudden they left, & light hovered for the next 2 to 3 hours, while rising slowly &zig~zaging slghtly. It also seemed to bounce a few times. All I could see was a bright light, really small, & thru my binoculars I could see a flashing green light under the bright light. I took several pictures. Not sure what it was. For all I know, It could have been a planet, as it was east of me before sunrise. I'll see what the pictures say. However, the green flashing light is what made me wonder more! Note: there were the brihtest northern lights from a sun solar flare & magnetic storm. Supposedly the brightest of this century.;44.6707000000001;-93.2587999999997
Bright light  formation moving at high rate of speed with no noise;2003-07-02 23:30:00;30 second;Bright light  formation moving at high rate of speed with no noise I had just laid down and was looking out our window, I saw a bright white light with four smaller red lights forming a diamond shape around it. Distance was about 1/2 mile heading north at a high rate of speed. I see commercial jets flying over every day and it was moving alot faster than I have ever seen anything else move except for military aircraft. The light was very large which made me think it was close. I could hear sounds of of crickets outside but this object emmitted no noise, NONE!!!! I told my wife to look and she commented on how fast it was moving. She thought it was probably a military jet. I said it's not making any noise? I used to be an aircraft mechanic and my wifes father is an aircraft mechanic. We both have spent our lives around airports and aircraft. Neither of us could explain this as something we recognized. I just wonder if anyone else saw this?;44.6707000000001;-93.2587999999997
Video of object over the Minneapolis metro area on 8-19-04;2004-08-19 17:00:00;12 hours;Video of object over the Minneapolis metro area on 8-19-04 My family and I viewed this object over the Minneapolis area on August 19th, 2004 from late afternoon until well after dark.  From the news reports I heard, the object was over the metropolitan area most of the day.  I took a video of it and it can be seen by pasting this address into your browser.  http://www.kevinandtammy.net/video/ufo.asx  The video causes the image to appear somewhat smaller than it did to the naked eye.  To get a better approximation, take a pea and hold it at arms length away from you.  The pea would be a fairly good representation of the size of the object.  We viewed it looking north and at about the 1:30 position horizontally.;44.6707000000001;-93.2587999999997
Peculiar light streaks.;2007-05-25 21:00:00;1-4 seconds;Peculiar light streaks. Tonight I was rinsing my mouth with water/salt for my mouth sores, and I looked out my kitchen window which was on top the sink I retrieved the water from.  At first glance, I saw a blinking light in non-stop motion.  I thought of it being a low-altitude plane, yet the light was too small (giving the appearance of a high-altitude one), plus at the given time, it was twilight, and I could not see the silhouette of the aircraft, which you would be able to normally.  After witnessing the flash, I thought of the object being a meteorite.  I looked back in curiosity, and I saw another quick streak of light shoot off in a different direction, near the point where the first light disappeared.  I aroused suspicion, and watched the sky longer.  The streak moved again, this time, heading westward, the opposite direction from which the first shot of light advanced.  And about a second later, another flash ensued, going in the direction making a complete box if the light were to move continuously, without an intermission.  Possibilities I assumed to which the lights could be were:  A helicopter Fireworks Or meteorites falling coincidentally to form four 90 degree angles.  Thank you for taking your time in reading this report, NUFORC.  If anyone else in the Dakota County area has witnessed this event, please post a report as well.  I am curious.

Light moving though sky leaving faint trail.;2014-07-15 22:46:00;2 minutes;Light moving though sky leaving faint trail. My family and I were having a bonfire and I was just looking up at the stars and after 15 mins or so, I noticed something that looked like a star but it was moving.   I watched it for a while, no strobe light just a star moving through the sky then the light after about 2 mins going southeast.   The light just  dimmed out and came back on then just dimmed out again for a final time and there was a faint trail me and my family noticed.

Witnessed a red/green/blue flashing light hovering in the night sky moving and dancing around.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2018-12-09 22:00:00;1 hour;Witnessed a red/green/blue flashing light hovering in the night sky.  Upon recording it I believe it is moving and dancing around.  Was more than a mile away.  It was not moving fast.  There was no wind.  Looking through binoculars it seems like the light was changing colors rapidly.;44.6707000000001;-93.2587999999997
Lights moving in single file line and direction toward NE sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-19 21:30:00;30 minutes;Lights moving in single file line and direction toward NE sky Watched a series of lights move across the sky tonight. Appeared to be satellites at first, but they kept coming wave after wave. Lights came from south / southwest sky moving northeast. Lights all followed same line of direction, spaced apart equally in single file line (this was continuous for several minutes.  Spacing was almost perfectly apart).  But witnessed a couple lights moving in parallel with each other, and one light appeared to change direction, moving 90 degrees from the others.  Continued to see lights throughout the evening in same direction, but usually just a single light, followed by another without any pattern.;44.6707000000001;-93.2587999999997
