Three glowing orange balls in Minnesota on july 4th 2010;2010-07-04 22:30:00;1 minute;Three glowing orange balls in Minnesota on july 4th 2010 I found another report of UFO sightings on July 4th in Lakeville MN and am confirming that report. Just after the fireworks show was done we were packing up chairs and stuff and in the opposite direction of the where the fireworks were I noticed three orange glowing spheres traveling very slowly to the east.  They were not very high up (probably 500-1000 ft) and were completely silent.  There were blackhawk helicopters at the event earlier that evening, but had left before the fireworks and they were very noisy. These orange balls were completely silent and were close enough I would have heard if it had props or jet engines..  It was obviously not fireworks or flares or balloons..         0;44.6707000000001;-93.2587999999997
