A circle of 12 white lights, not moving.;2015-08-09 22:00:00;1 hour;A circle of 12 white lights, not moving. The sighting was of a circle of 12 white lights, which were stationary in the sky.  They would occasionally fade and then come back bright again.  We watched for about an hour before they completely faded, no idea how long they had been there before we spotted them.  A second smaller circle of lights could be seen under the first one as it faded. We have some good photos.  Three other people, a mile from our house, also saw the same thing after we asked them to look. ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected advertising lights at a local casino.
