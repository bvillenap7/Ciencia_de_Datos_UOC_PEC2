Pyramidal-shaped Craft Over Lakeville North High School Field;2010-07-04 21:00:00;10 minutes;Pyramidal-shaped Craft Over Lakeville North High School Field Our family attended the Fourth of July fireworks show in Lakeville, Minnesota this evening.  My entire family and several other people sitting around us witnessed a light brown flying object with a glowing golden ball in the center.   This thing was not an airplane or firework debris, as it slowly flew across the length of the entire sky over our heads in a curved line at the same altitude.  It flew from a west direction towards the east, but then curved northward, again at what appeared to be the same altitude throughout.   The top of this thing spun around, and one side of it was black with something that protruded from it (you could see this black side with the protruding thing spinning slowly as it flew across the sky.)  It had no smoke, no sound, and this protruding thing swung around the top of it only randomly and very slowy while the bottom of it did not spin.  The best way I could describe the protruding black thing was that it looked like a large tel! escope with a dark shiny window in the center of it.  I say it was shiny window because you could see light reflecting off of the center of it, but the rest of the telescope thing itself didn't reflect light.   The entire object was pyramid shaped, but the top of it spun around slowly while the bottom of it seemed to remain stationery.  A glowing orange ball was right in the center of the bottom of it.   There were at least twenty five other people around us who looked up with us and watched this thing as it slowly flew by.  I have never seen a ufo before, but I have never seen anything like this thing that we saw tonight.   It happened at around 9pm at Lakeville North Highschool, about an hour before the fireworks began.;44.6707000000001;-93.2587999999997

It could've been farther away because of my viewpoint from the highway.  Flashed really bright for a few seconds, then disappeared.  I kept trying to find it again and almost ran off the road.;44.6707000000001;-93.2587999999997
