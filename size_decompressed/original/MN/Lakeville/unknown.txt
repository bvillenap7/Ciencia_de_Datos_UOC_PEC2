Four sperical orbs rotation counter-clockwise, clockwise, and stationary for about a 15min ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));2004-09-07 12:00:00;15min;Four sperical orbs rotation counter-clockwise, clockwise, and stationary for about a 15min duration then decent  evidence on the way. Tonight is the 7th of September and I havn't seen a UFO with this much complexity and mistique ever.  From my friend's house in Lakeville along cedar we saw four green solid lights in the horizon about 3 miles away (about.)  These sperical orbs rotated counter-clockwise for about 8-10mins and changed course spontanoiusly.  They rotated clockwise for a short time and eventually stopped rotation and retained at square and stationary decent twords the ground.   As it decended the orbs sowed their roation and sunk twords earth.  The total specticale was only about fifteen minuted till we decided to hop in our cars and follow the cellestial visit - about five minutes later by the time we reached the main road the UFO sank faster then we could trace it so it so as far as we know it just dissapeared.  These sperical green-lighted orbs seemed inquizative and changed its roation at an unrecognizable frequincy whilst my companions could only watch in awe at the most fucked up sight we've ever seen. By the way i have a friend who recorded the whole of this sighting on a video recording cell phone.. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We do not understand why the witness indicates that the date is approximate, given that he submits the report on the date the event occurred.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??

As I was telling him about it a bright low flying light was going by. No blinking lights to low to be a satellite. It zig zagged two separate times and was right above us and appeared to shoot straight up and disappear. 5 min later similar light in northern part of the sky was going across and shot out red light out of two sides and also disappeared.;44.6707000000001;-93.2587999999997
