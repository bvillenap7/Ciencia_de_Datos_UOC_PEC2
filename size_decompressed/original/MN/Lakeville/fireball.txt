Red light object in the Minnesota sky;2011-09-05 21:45:00;4-5 mins;Red light object in the Minnesota sky Around 21:45 on Monday 5th 2011, I was outside with my longtime friend, on my backyard patio (which is south facing). When we observed a ball of red light coming over the top of the neighboring house.  The object was approximately 5 miles away.  There was no noise.   It was the size of a thumb nail from our prospective. The craft itself was around the size of a large pickup truck from what I could observe. It was traveling north toward us, at a low rate of speed. Almost as if it were hovering.  The light on the object would dim really low then would become 10 times its size and be very bright.   It was red in color and the part of the object that you could see behind the light appeared to be glowing red, almost like hot metal. After a few minutes it was around 2 miles away from us and there was still no noise.   It remained hovering for around 1 minute and then proceeded to fly upward at such a high rate of speed that it was out of sight within 3-4 seconds. It went ! straight up and disappeared into the stars;44.6707000000001;-93.2587999999997
