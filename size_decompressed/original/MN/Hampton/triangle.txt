TRIANGULAR CRAFT HOVERING AT HAMPTON, MINNESOTA - 04:00 AUGUST 2006;2006-08-20 04:00:00;3 minutes;TRIANGULAR CRAFT HOVERING AT HAMPTON, MINNESOTA - 04:00 AUGUST 2006 I was driving on highway 52 south from Minneapolis to my home in Rochester. I am a 53 year-old male RN and had just finished working.   I saw a bright light on over the highway in the distance and thought that an airliner was approaching the Minneapolis airport prematurely.  As I drove closer, I then thought that the light was a medical helicopter and I was about to come upon an accident.  As I reached Hampton, a very small town than highway 52 passes through, I was astonished to see a triangular shaped craft hovering motionlessly a few hundred feet from the highway, only at about 500 feet of altitude.  The light that I had seen was a unidirectional spotlight mounted on top of the craft, on some kind of pole or extension device.   A county sheriff's patrol car was parked with its lights off observing the craft.  Although I had a camera in the car, I nearly had a panic attack from seeing something that defied my imagination.  I drove slowly by the scene and the craft continued to hover as I saw it in my rear view mirror as I drove away.  I saw no visible means of propulsion on either the underside or sides of the craft.  No vents, no heat plume, and absolutely no noise.;44.6055;-92.9468
