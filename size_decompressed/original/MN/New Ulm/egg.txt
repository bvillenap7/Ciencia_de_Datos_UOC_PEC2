Bright, then dim white light...very rapid leaps of horizontal and vertical direction.  ((anonymous source));2019-05-25 22:30:00;5 minutes;Bright, then dim white light...very rapid leaps of horizontal and vertical direction. Alternating bright, then dim white light.  Zig-zag pattern, as well as up and down.  Would shine very brightly, then dim.  Sudden, rapid changes in direction too fast for any known aircraft.  I'm a private pilot, so I can say this without equivocation. ((NUFORC Note:  String of Space Link satellites.
