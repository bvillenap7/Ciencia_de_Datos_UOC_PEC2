Just then we saw a passenger jet (more then likely out of the Minneapolis major airport) traveling in a east to west path. WE held our breath because we thought they were going to collide with each other !! They had to have seen each other. Just after that the bright light looked like it shot outward deeper into space because it stopped where it was at, sat there fore a monment and started to get smaller and then it disappeared.;44.3056;-94.4694
