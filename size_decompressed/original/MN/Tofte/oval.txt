Green Glowing Oval Shaped UFO viewed over Lake Superior Minnesota.;2008-03-19 03:15:00;60-90 seconds;Green Glowing Oval Shaped UFO viewed over Lake Superior Minnesota On the early morning (of July 19th 2009 (approximately 3:15am-3:25am) while staying at a resort in the town of Tofte Minnesota I observed a lime green glowing oval shaped Unidentified flying object traveling north from the south over Lake Superior. I had been sitting out on the balcony since around midnight when my wife feel asleep watching ships, satellites, and aircraft out above the lake using my Steiner 8x30 binoculars which I also used while observing the strange craft. For the record I grew up near a airport and Army Air Reserve base and have had an interest in avionics since I was a child. It maintained the same altitude and speed for the entire duration while observed. I had awoken my wife to view the object but she was to tired to comprehend what it was she was seeing and now recalls seeing A Strange Green Flying Light. She was very exhausted (Having been sunburned from earlier that afternoon). I'm a night owl and she goes to bed usually hours before I do. This incident has also been reported to MUFON in detail including accurate weather reports from that night/morning that I acquired online from the Weather Monitoring Station report approximately 25 miles north of Tofte MN. Also included the locations of the moon and other prominent celestial bodies that night/morning. I sincerely have no idea what this object could have been. Nothing conventional I can be sure of that much.;47.5711;-90.8328
