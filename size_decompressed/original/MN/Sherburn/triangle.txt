I went to the back to see what was causing him to behave this way. I opened the back door to see what was going on and at first I did not see anything out of the ordinary. Then out of the corner of my eye I noticed movement at about the 10 o clock position. There was an object in the sky hovering pretty low I would say at the height of about a 7 story building. I would estimate that it was around 25 to 30 feet in length.  It was triangular in shape and had a faint glowing light of a light red/amber color in each corner of the object (3 lights total). It made no sound at all, it just seemed to be stuck there not moving at all. I was becoming rather fearful at this strange sight, but my curiosity got the better of me and I stepped off my back deck/step to get a better look and just as I did this the object began to move.  It moved slowly at first still without making a sound then it started doing something really strange it seemed to vanish and then reappear at a different place, it did this for a short time (less than 10 seconds) then shot off at a very high speed to the north.  All the while it did not make a single sound. I was unable to see what color the object was but there were reflections of city lights on it so it was a shiny surface. The shape as I said was triangular but not perfectly triangular it was like the points of the triangle were cut off.;43.6641;-94.7239
