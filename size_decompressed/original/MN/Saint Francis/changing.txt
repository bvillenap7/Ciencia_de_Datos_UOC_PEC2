At first I thought it was an airplane or a star, but then it moved and there were others going around it, almost as if it was dancing with each other.  They were round sometimes, and oblong others, and sometimes they were almost like lines, or a circle with the middle cut out.  I stared at them until I came inside.   A neighbor boy saw them, but didn't think they were important.;45.3912;-93.3546
