7 cigar shaped objects in the sky early monday morning;2013-04-29 08:00:00;5 minutes;7 cigar shaped objects in the sky early monday morning I was smokeing a cigarette out my apartment window..and looked up to check the cloud cover and there was none, I saw what looked like Ducks flying in a V formation, and thought Ducks dont fly that high. as I watched the group fly closer I realized they had no wings and did not Staiger, they moved very slow and began to form a circle and disappeared over the trees and I lost sight.  I did take pictures cause they were moveing so slow, they were to far away to show on my photo and video camera.;45.3912;-93.3546
