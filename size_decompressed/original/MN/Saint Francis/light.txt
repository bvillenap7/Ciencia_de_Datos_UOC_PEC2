Living near ATK proving grounds, explosions are often heard during the day, but never at night!  Got out of bed to see if anything was seen or heard again. The local Fire Department was on the air but I did not hear the nature of the call on a scanner, just heard them clear!  The bright light appeared to move then stop over the NW sky approximately 30-45Â° inclination.  Very unusual for NW Anoka County.;45.3912;-93.3546
