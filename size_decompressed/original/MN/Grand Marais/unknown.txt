Two males snowmobiling out on a northern Minnesota lake on March 5th around 9:30 p.m. when they spotted lights above the trees above some cabins. Four lights in a row, 3 different lights blinking on & off, and different 2 lights blinking.   Lake is 1 and 1/2 miles long, 3/4 mile wide.  The craft was down on one end of lake and large enough to block a television tower light which has never been out in 40 years.  They went and got two more friends, one male and one female.  Craft was still there when they snowmobiled back onto the lake.  One of the males said that he could see that there was metal or a shape reflected as the lights blinked off and on.  It stayed in the same position and did not move.  They did comment that an airplane had flown over during the time they observed it.  They left before the craft left because they were worried about the power on there machines going out. It was clear to all that these were lights not reflections.   They have lived on this lake for many years and commented that they have never seen anything like this before.;47.7783;-90.3436
Early August 2013  Near Eagle Mountain of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area of Northern Minnesota  Around 10 p.m. CDT  At a camp site, I l;2013-08-05 22:00:00;30 seconds;Early August 2013  Near Eagle Mountain of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area of Northern Minnesota  Around 10 p.m. CDT   At a camp site, I looked up at the stars and saw a large object, perhaps the dimensions of a large, long air plane, at the height of what an air plane would appear just taking off from an airport and gaining altitude.  It could possibly have been two objects travelling in unison, but I had the impression it was one.  However, it did not seem to occlude the stars beyond it. This object however moved straight across the sky (at the speed an airport just gaining altitude would have). It moved across my field of vision in about 20-30 seconds. It had a white, non-flashing light at each end. It made absolutely no sound in a quiet, secluded camp site.;47.7783;-90.3436

Went out of house saw red and white flashing lights in moonless clear night. Could not make out shape of object. ((anonymous report));2017-07-24 23:50:00;2 minutes;Went out of house saw red and white flashing lights in moonless clear night.  Could not make out shape of object.  Object was traveling north and flashing red and white lights were appearing and disappearing in a circular rotation at least by my estimate 1 mile apart.  Object was far away and could be seen with big dipper constilation in background. Object omitted no sound traveling slowly across the sky until disappearing behind trees.
