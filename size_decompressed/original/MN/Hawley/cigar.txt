cigar streaking across the sky eastward;2001-09-11 06:00:00;<1minute;cigar streaking across the sky eastward Ok never seen anything since that day even remotely the same.   I woke up early that day and peered out the window as I often do in the morning.  But this morning I saw a cigar shaped silvery object at low altitude streaking across the sky in an easterly direction.  I thought it must be a jet--but it was to low and no noise was present.  Even more confusing, there appeared to be no wings on this thing.   I am still unsure of what I saw.  It seems very strange to me to say it must have been a UFO, but I cannot rule this out.  I have never seen anything remotely the same since that day.  Like everyone that day -- nothing seemed real.  However, I imagine if it was a UFO and this craft was moving eastward it is likely that the craft could have been on an intercept course to observe that mornings terror that would follow.  I am not a UFO fanatic, and I do not aspire to be one.  However, I have wondered if anyone else saw anything weird that day.  I hope something good can come from my witness account of the UFO ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));46.9781;-96.4095
