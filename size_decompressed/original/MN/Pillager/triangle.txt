A huge, Black Triangle hovers above the Pillager Water Tower! It was 4:45 am, I was getting ready for work. I heard a trainlike rumbling. It was out of the ordinary tho. Caught my attention. I ran out onto the deck & the low-end hum was tactile! Shaking the hair in my arms! I looked to the northeast, there it was! Big as night! A Huge, non-reflective, black triangle object! Just floating above the Pillager Water Tower. Hanging there humming. Maybe 100 feet or so above the tower. It had 3 star-like, lights! 1 on each point of the triangle. I was stunned! I couldn't believe my eyes! Couldn't believe this was happening to me! The freakiest feeling I've ever encountered. Ever! Then, as I saw a small plane approaching directly from the northwest, the Triangle began to depart. As if it knew it was visible. The low-end hum began to speed up as the Triangle slowly made it's way off. It seemed to just float away in the strangest manner! This thing was like 3 city blocks long! Never ever seen anything that big move that slow with that much power! As it sped up, a circular, multicolored light in the center of the triangle began to light up & spin. Then, it vanished.;46.3635;-94.4926
