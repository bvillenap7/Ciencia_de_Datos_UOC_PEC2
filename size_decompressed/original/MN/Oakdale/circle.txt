Circular shape with bright light, green underneath moved from left to right at incredible speed and shot up into the night sky.;2017-09-20 21:20:00;5-10 seconds;Circular shape with bright light, green underneath moved from left to right at incredible speed and shot up into the night sky. Driving south on Inwood towards Woodbury, cornfields on both sides of road, directly in front to the right of the car above (approx a football field above) the treeline my daugher and I saw a very bright light with a green hue underneath.   This ball of light moved with speed in which could not have been anything man made.  It moved from right to left at about the speed, as if you move your head as fast as you can from one side to the other.   It than shot directly up into the sky and was gone in a matter of seconds.  Never seen anything like it and can not explain it.;44.9926;-92.9537
