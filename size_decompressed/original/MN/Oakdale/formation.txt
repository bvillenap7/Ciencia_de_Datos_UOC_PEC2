White in nature - one varied to red.;2013-10-16 19:05:00;10 minutes;White in nature - one varied to red Saw nearly stationary formation of 4 lights in sky. White in color although the trailing one alternated to a bit of red at times.  * * * * Roughly as above from east to west I was in car and as I was driving south the lights seemed to move over me and then disappeared.  Looked like they were fairly high in sky but more in the 5 - 10K ft height wise.;44.9926;-92.9537
Blue light formation moved through clouds overhead.;2016-04-23 23:50:00;10-15 seconds;Blue light formation moved through clouds overhead. We were driving north on 694 through Oakdale, between 10th (County Road 10) and 34th (County Road 14). I was looking out the passenger window, to the northeast. It was raining lightly, and the clouds were very low. I saw one blue light shining in the sky I assumed it was a low-flying airplane. I soon saw another two, slightly fainter, blue lights that formed a line in the shape of a slash: /  The lower two lights were closer together, with the third at the top.   The lights appeared to be moving south at a very high speed I watched the lights as they moved straight south past our vehicle, and tracked them to the south until they vanished from sight.   From first seeing the lights until they disappeared, it was between 10 and 15 seconds.   No one else in the vehicle noticed the lights, even though it had all the appearances of an extremely low-flying airplane.;44.9926;-92.9537
