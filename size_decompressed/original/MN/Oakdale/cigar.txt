Altitude seemed to stay very constant. The object had a red blinking light on the bottom and a white one on top, was oblong shaped, not far off from a cigar shape. There were also blinking lights around the entire craft. We ruled out helicoptors, blimps and other objects becuase of the time of day and slow speed. Maybe we are wrong, but it seemed to just hover slowly, making it's way west, north west.;44.9926;-92.9537
