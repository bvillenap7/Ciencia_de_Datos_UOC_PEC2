Guards asked for OD to go to their location in the North part of base.  They pointed out over the northern sky three brigthly lit white circles that pulsated slightly.  They were stationary at first and then moved at fantastic speeds, movements and speeds that I have never seen nor can I explain, moved in triangle type patterns.  No noise, altitude was very high, in sky 1/2 distance from horizon to straight ahead.  Left area by shooting straight away from us in an instant.  Lights moved independant of each other, they were not attached and appeared to be three separate vehicles.;46.3521;-94.1046000000001
