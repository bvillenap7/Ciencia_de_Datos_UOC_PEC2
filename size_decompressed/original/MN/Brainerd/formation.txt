3 seperate sighting of a series of 6 red lights taking on a wing formation, slow moving, engine sound (but not jet engine);2003-08-30 23:30:00;2 minutes;3 seperate sighting of a series of 6 red lights taking on a wing formation, slow moving, engine sound (but not jet engine) This occurred at our propery outside of Brainerd, MN. At 11:30pm, 12:25am and 1:30am. There were six red lights in a wing pattern, but no tail lights, it was moving fairly slowly and looked quite large, I heard a definite engine sound, but did not sound like a typical jet aircraft. There is no airfield large enough to land such a large craft (I did not make out an actual shape or craft, just the lights, but they spanned a large area). The same (or different) lights, traveled over the same path on the 3 seperate times indicated above - I tried to take pictures the second time, I have not yet developed the film. The exact location was at the Mississippi River, at Riverton, MN (at the location of Rabbit lake). I did not call the hotline since it may have been planes (but it must have been a huge plane and I don't know where such a plane would land) and I don't know how to check with the local airports to see if it was in fact a plane (somebody would have been tracking it, I assume). We have been going to this piece of property for 3 years and I have never seen similar air traffic- which is why I thought I would report it.;46.3521;-94.1046000000001
