Two lights that hovered and moved irregularly far off in the distance.;2011-05-02 21:30:00;at least 15 minutes;Two lights that hovered and moved irregularly far off in the distance. I saw a light in the sky when I went outside to have my last cigarette of the night.  It was about the size of a star (but a little larger), and it had a definite blinking unlike the twinkle you would see from a star.   It sat in one place for several minutes, then dropped quickly and went back up again.  It did this several times.  It did not have the same type of motion as a plane.   I saw another one similar to it to the right of the original light (quite far off from the first one) doing the same things.  I watched both lights for about 15 minutes and they were still there when I went into the house.   My wife came and looked at them both too and noted the same things I did.  We live in a very rural area - no city lights.;46.3521;-94.1046000000001
Swarm of multi-colored lights over northern Minnesota.;2017-07-15 22:15:00;10 minutes;Swarm of multicolored lights over northern Minnesota. Multiple colored lights moving North to South in straight paths about 2215 hours?  Watched about two dozen over the course of five minutes moving at the speed of satellites, but much larger.  White, blue, red, green and orange on multiple trajectories.  Steady state, no flashing.  No sound.;46.3521;-94.1046000000001
Very fast bright light.;2017-08-19 18:00:00;5 seconds;Very fast bright light. Observed a bright light in western sky. Red violet in color. I just happened to look towards the sky and noticed this light sitting still.  Just as I noticed the light, it took off very fast to the north.  I watched it heading north for just about one second before it seemed to go even faster and disappear.;46.3521;-94.1046000000001
