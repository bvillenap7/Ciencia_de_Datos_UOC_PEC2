While picking up hay bales at night, I saw a triangular shaped object speed through the night sky.;1969-07-07 23:00:00;20 seconds;While picking up hay bales at night, I saw a triangular shaped object speed through the night sky. We had bales of hay to pick up on the ground, my father and I, and it was suppose to rain the following day so we went out at night with a tractor and wagon to pick them up.  While there on a cloudless night a triangular shaped object sped across the sky from horizon to horizon at incredible speed.  There was no sonic boom, no vapor trail we could see no noise at all.  We couldn't see the object itself, only three bright lights of different colors, maybe green and blue, which defined the shape as a very large triangle.  There had been reports of an expected meteor shower that night, and at first we wondered if that is what we were seeing.  But it flew to low to be meteors and there was no streaking affect like you usually see with those. Also, the color of the lights didn't change.  We were speechless for we knew we had witnessed something highly unusual.  For many years we talked about it.  My father died in 1995.  He had been in the military and was quite knowledgeable about planes.  He was absolutely sure it was no terrestial aircraft, partly because of the color pattern he was. I am not quite sure of the year.  It might have been a year or two sooner.  I know I wasn't in high school yet.  But I wanted to leave a record of this on file so at least someone would know it happened.  The most important aspect of the sighting was the speed and size of the object.  As far as I know, nothing can fly this fast through the atmospere without burning up.  That's what I remember the most. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));46.3521;-94.1046000000001
