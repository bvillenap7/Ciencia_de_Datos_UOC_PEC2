This is approximately 7-10 miles to the northwest of the below sighting.   This cigar/circular light with multiple colors floated over the edge of the lake at approximately 200 feet.  It was completely silent.  It then left at an extremely high rate of speed at a 45 degree angle and was gone within seconds.  This was never reported to my knowledge by anyone in the boat for fear of ridicule.  This was also seen by a local farmer on the northwest edge of Camp Ripley.  Please see referenced sighting below. There is no possible explanation other than UFO that I am aware of. Occurred : 6/20/1975 02:00 (Entered as : 06/20/75 02:00)  Reported: 3/19/1999 23:01  Posted: 4/2/1999  Location: Brainerd (near), MN  Shape: Circle  Duration:15 minutes  Witnessed three circle of lights, pulsating at times and stationary at first, when moving moved at tremendeous speed and erratic movements   Serving as Officer of the Day at US Army NG camp in MN in 1975.  Guards asked for OD to go to their location in the North part of base.  They pointed out over the northern sky three brigthly lit white circles that pulsated slightly.  They were stationary at first and then moved at fantastic speeds, movements and speeds that I have never seen nor can I explain, moved in triangle type patterns.  No noise, altitude was very high, in sky 1/2 distance from horizon to straight ahead.  Left area by shooting straight away from us in an instant.  Lights moved independant of each other, they were not attached and appeared to be three separate vehicles.;46.3521;-94.1046000000001
Cigar shaped craft witnessed by two people.;2013-08-30 15:30:00;45 seconds;Cigar shaped craft witnessed by two people. We were sitting on our front deck smoking a cigarette, we both looked up to watch a helicopter fly over our house.   To the right and much higher than the helicopter was a cigar shaped craft that may have been sectioned (the best way I can describe it.) moving from the SE to NW.  We watched it until no longer visible.  It was no plane, at that height we would have seen wings and tail.  I will try to include a drawing of what we saw.;46.3521;-94.1046000000001
