On highway 2 in Pine Center, MN, but I'm not exactly sure if this was a UFO or not but, my boyfriend and i were driving back from grand casino mille lacs taking the back roads (highway 2).   As soon as i took the left towards the pepsi plant something very strange happened.  It was like i went deaf and could hear nothing.  Not even the sound of my own breathing, while this was happening i had seen glittery sparks over my eyes for about 7 seconds.  Keep in mind we are driving while this is happening.   Then as soon as the weird glitter sparks were gone i had noticed NOTHING around me had changed!!!  It was like we had went through this weird cut in time or something?!   I started to freak out and preceded to ask my boyfriend if he had just experienced the same thing but, before i even had time to ask him, he asked me. did you feel that?!?!   I'm not sure if this was some kind of slice in time or if it was the aliens messing with us??  Or maybe we were abducted or something and just didnt realize it.   Whatever it was, we were both really freaked out.   Also, note that we are/were completely sober people. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
