Saw flying rectangle that reflected sunrise colors;1996-06-15 07:30:00;5 minutes;saw flying rectangle that reflected sunrise colors This happened in 1996 when I was in sixth grade. I can not remember the date. I was waiting for the bus when I saw a flying rectangle hovering above the Buhl bus garage.  It was between 7-8a.m The flying rectangle hovered for about 5min.  It was large enough to fit 4 or fewer and the craft reflected all the colors of the sunrise but the sun was already up and the sky was clear. Everyone at the bus stop saw it. There were 6-10 of us waiting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.4924;-92.7593
