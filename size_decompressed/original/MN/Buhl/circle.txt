Three small circles of bright white light shot up from the ground.  As they got higher the balls of light got bigger and bigger.  When they stopped gaining height they were the size a man hole cover in the sky and got brighter and brighter.  They got to their brightest point and flashed out,  I seen two more little blinks of light and then nothing.  No trails.;47.4924;-92.7593
