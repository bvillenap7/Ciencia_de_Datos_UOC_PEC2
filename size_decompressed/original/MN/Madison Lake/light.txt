Three orange lights in the sky.;2014-02-07 19:50:00;1-2 minutes;Three orange lights in the sky My husband and I were driving east on Highway 60 toward the small town of Madison Lake.  Just before entering city limits, I noticed two orange lights in the northeast sky.  They were not blinking as airplanes do, and they were close together.  They appeared to remain parallel it almost suggested they were flying in a formation.  As we continued east into town, I noticed a third orange light to my right (the southern sky).  We watched this light cross our path above us, flying from south to north.  At first we thought maybe it was a meteor, but the brightness was consistent.  It was fast, but not super-fast, just steady. We wondered if it was joining the other two lights.  By this time, the other two lights disappeared.  We watched the third light for about 30 seconds to a minute before it disappeared. The observers are college-educated professionals one a business-owner, the other a university professor.  This is our first sighting of an unidentified object.  It was so strange and unexplained that I felt compelled to report it to someone.;44.2253;-93.8301
