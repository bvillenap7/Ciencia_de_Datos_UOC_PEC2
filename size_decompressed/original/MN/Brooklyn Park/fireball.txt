red/orange balls over brooklyn Park target going east to west;2011-07-01 22:00:00;2 or 3 min.;red/orange balls over brooklyn Park target going east to west Well I was waiting for my wife at a Target store in Brooklyn Park, MN.   When I noticed 3 lights coming from the East going West, they were red orange balls.   At first I thought they mite be helicopters, but color did  not fit.  As the came closer they were round and the moved slowly in the night sky.   Time was about 10 pm  they did not make any noise and stayed on a straight line and spaced pretty even, I could not tell how far apart the were maybe  a half a block or so.  There was about 10 or 12 people watching it happen, I do not know any of them.   When I realized they where not planes, I remove my camera from the bag and started taking pictures.. Using a Canon camera with a 300 mm lens. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.1184;-93.3461
