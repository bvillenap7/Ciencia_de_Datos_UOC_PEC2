Cigar-shaped with dome, metallic headed West of Minneapolis at low level, was by 694W 17:45pm;2017-05-09 17:45:00;17:45;Cigar shaped with dome, metallic headed West of Minneapolis at low level, was by 694W 17:45pm Seen traveling west at low altitude.  Had a cigar shape and slight dome on top visible because it was reflecting so much light.  I know planes very well, and watch the skies daily.  Never seen something like this before.   It headed straight west and disappeared into the clouds.  All this took place in a matter of 20 to 30 seconds.   Pulled over and checked my flight radar app, nothing close to that size within 100 miles or more.  No sound.  No lights and it appears to be all metallic as it was reflecting so much light.  Friend compared it to a B-2 flying off and me looking at it from back.  Possible, but highly unlikely a B-2 flies so low over Minneapolis metro area.;45.1184;-93.3461
