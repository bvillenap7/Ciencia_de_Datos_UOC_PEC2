Lime green orb of light seen descending in Brooklyn Park, MN by multiple parties;2008-07-20 21:40:00;5 seconds;Lime green orb of light seen descending in Brooklyn Park, MN by multiple parties I am reporting this not as a witness but as an investigator in to this strange occurrence.  My brother and five friends were traveling in a car when they saw an intensely lit lime green spherical orb descend from a cloud in the Eastern sky.  My brother the driver was first to see the object and quickly pointed it out to the passengers.   They all claim that the object moved from a point high above a cloud to a position at the same level as the cloud where the orb then disappeared.  It moved at a speed possibly 2 to 3 times that of a commercial airliner and was slightly smaller than the size of the moon in the sky.  They also claim that the orb had a sort of haze around it for the entire five seconds that the orb existed.  My friend who was a passenger in the car called two of his buddies afterwards who also saw the same orb from about .35 miles NE of their position at Super America at 93rd Ave and Zane Ave. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

3 Red/Orange ball in night sky Brooklyn Park MN;2011-06-01 22:00:00;2 min.;3 Red/Orange ball in night sky Brooklyn Park MN Well, I was waiting for my wife at a Target store in Brooklyn Park, Mn.   When I noticed 3 lights coming from the East going West, they were red orange balls.  At first I thought they mite be helicopters, but color did  not fit.  As the came closer they were round and the moved slowly in the night sky. Time was about 10 pm  they did not make any noise and stayed on a straight line and spaced pretty even, I could not tell how far apart the were maybe  a half a block or so.  There was about 10 or 12 people watching it happen, I do not know any of them.   When I realized they where not planes I remove my camera from the bag and started taking pictures..  Using a Canon camera with a 300 mm lens. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.1184;-93.3461
