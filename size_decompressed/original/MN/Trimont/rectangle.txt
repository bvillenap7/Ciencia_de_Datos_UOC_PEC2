White rectangular object, climbing steeply into the sky.;2017-06-28 19:30:00;45 seconds;White rectangular object, climbing steeply into the sky. We were sitting outside enjoying the late afternoon/early evening.  I happened to look up in the sky and saw a white rectangular form climbing steeply into the sky.  At one point, the sun reflected brightly off of it (for several seconds).   It climbed very quickly-to the south/southwest and disappeared when passing over, then beyond a tall cumulus cloud in the distance.  By this time, it merely a white speck in the sky. It was completely silent.  It didn't have wings.  It was in a position where we would have heard the sound of it, climbing into the sky.   I've never seen anything like this in entire lifetime+. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Sorry about the date.  It was early evening Wed. June 28.,  ((END ADDENDUM));43.7827;-94.7186
