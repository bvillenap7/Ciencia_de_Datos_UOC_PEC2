I noticed a small gray object 30-35 degrees above the horizon, traveling straight west.  At first I thought it was simply a floater in mt eye, but then realized it was going straight west at a rapid pace.  Trimont lies six miles north of Interstate 90, which travels straight east to west through this area, and I wondered if this object was following the Interstate toward Sioux Falls, SD.  When the object was roughly straight south of us it seemed to drastically increase its speed, and joined another object that was just ahead of it and also traveling west.  I hadn't noticed this object until the gray object pulled along side of it.  This object appeared to be black in color.  Just a second later the two objects became lost amid nearby tree branches, and that was the end of the event.  This whole occurrence couldn't have lasted more ! than 3-5 seconds.  The speed of these objects, whatever they are, is absolutely phenomonal!!;43.7827;-94.7186
