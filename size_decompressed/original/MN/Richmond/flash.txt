It was a horizontal flash, larger than a jet in three separate jagged lines...not lightning. 5 of us were on our pontoon boat and I saw a horizontal flash of light in 3 separate lines across the sky…there is no way it was a plane…  It only lasted a few seconds, but it was bright..then gone.   The length of the light flashes was 3 times longer than a jet from the distance I saw it…it was not lightning as there was not a cloud in the sky;45.4634;-94.5382
