It started as a bright light that flew through our trees at a very high rate of speed, then a couple of hours later I was waken from a sound sleep and I felt compelled to look out the window of my bedroom. There in thenorthern sky approx. 500 ft in the air was a circular object that slowly rotated and changed colors. This happened every night for 3 nights in a row at the very same time.  A Neighbor 1/2 mile away also saw it. He was North of our house and it was south of his location which placed right between our homes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));48.6926;-96.1858
