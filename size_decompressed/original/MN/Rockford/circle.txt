Witness A noticed red hovering flashing orb that caught her eye at around 10:30 pm. Witness A then called over witness B who approached the window assuming it was a radio tower we both had not notice previously.  On closer inspection we both notice the orb was hovering to the left and then to the right slowly.  It stayed in sight while blinking for around 4 minutes before suddenly disappearing.  Witness A remained at the window, while witness B started googleing what this could possibly be.  After a while, Witness A then called over Witness B yet again upon spotting 1 more lights that was flashing red and then white in the same area.  This then split into two separate flashing objects.  The red and white lights were moving very slowly to the left and then very slowly moving back to a neutral position.  This lasted for around 2 minutes before moving to left once more and disappearing behind the trees out of view.   Witness A and B stayed at the window for around 10 more minutes. Then we both notice what we believe to be a plane flying by that similar area heading to the right until it disappeared from view (over the house).;45.0887;-93.7313
