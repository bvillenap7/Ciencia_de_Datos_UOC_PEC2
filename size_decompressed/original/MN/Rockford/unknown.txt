This is no joke I'm 47 years old have a good business;1977-08-15 01:00:00;2+hrs;This is no joke I'm 47 years old have a good business   I was 17 plus years old and had taken my girl friend home from our first date at a drive-in movie  [we do not drink or do drugs ] .She lives out in the country 8 to 10 miles out from the city on a dirt road.   After dropping her off on the way home 1 to 2 miles down the road I made a right hand turn ,The car lit up inside and out , the car stopped. I was scared but got out. To take a look at the car . Then I started to walk, got 20 to 30 feet down the road. And a man and woman in a car pulled over and picked me up and drove me home into the city without asking me directions. I thought that maybe 45 minutes had passed max. Opened me front door looked at the clock it was 5:30 am .I was wide awake as though I had a good nights sleep. Asked my older sister if I could use her car to get my car. Grabbed some tools and drove back to try to fix the car .The car was where I left it I decided to try to start it first and it started .I had no problem with it. The only ones that I ever told were my sister and my wife after being married for quite some time [years later]  Whenever I tried to talk about it I get sick to my stomach can any help ?
