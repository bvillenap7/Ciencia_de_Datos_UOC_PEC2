Cigar-shaped silver object in the sky.;2016-03-01 13:00:00;3 minutes;cigar shaped silver object in the sky This was on a highway close to town where I saw a cigar shaped silver object which had no wings and no lights.  It was about 800 feet up where a small plane would fly.   It was flying at a steady speed and just kept on going off into the distance.  I had seen a similar object in this same area about 5 years ago.;46.3135;-95.7195
