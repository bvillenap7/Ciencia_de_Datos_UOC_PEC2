Bright white object seen zig-zagging across Northern Minnesota near Ely.;2016-05-30 01:00:00;45 seconds;Bright white object seen zig-zagging across Northern Minnesota near Ely. Sitting around a fire with my brother and one of my dad's old high school buddies, looking up at the stars and watching satellites, when a bright white object emerged in the sky traveling in a South to North direction.   The object was brighter than all the other stars in the sky and moved in zig-zags, sometimes stopping briefly after maneuver.  In approximately 45 seconds, perhaps less, the object had already cleared the horizon much faster than any satellite.   The object emitted white light and was considerably brighter than the brightest star.  No discernible sound was heard.  It appeared to be traveling at a high altitude.  I am writing this months later, but I am curious to find out if anyone else in the region can corroborate this experience.;47.9009;-91.8562
