Was walking down the street and saw a sliver type object that appeared to be moving in a mechanical way in one solid direction. The object all of a sudden got very bright (in a reflective type way away from the sun) then dissapeared shortly after. Thought it may have been something burning up in the atmosphere but it seemed too mechanical close and steady.;47.9009;-91.8562
