5 lights in the sky formed one object.;2012-01-17 17:35:00;5 seconds;5 lights in the sky formed one object. I was traveling south from Ely to Babbitt tonight, and what I saw was nothing I have never seen before. I was with my wife, 14 year old son, and 2 year old daughter.   We saw 5 very distinct and very bright lights that formed the shape of a roof with a very gradual pitch.  The object was about 5000 feet in the air.  It is hard to judge the height, but it had to be near that.  I was looking at it at about a 60 degree angle.   The lights from point to point were approximately 300 feet.  The lights flashed off and back on. The craft moved one width of itself to the west.  They flashed off and on one more time and the object had moved one more time at the same interval.  Then the lights went out and it was gone.   We didn't see it leave, and the sky was still light enough that we would have seen a plane.   We all saw the exact same thing and none of us have any rational explanation for what we witnessed tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone on two occasions with this witness, and we found him to be quite objective and credible.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));47.9009;-91.8562
