Round bright pink/orange objects in relation to each other.;2020-05-23 10:15:00;1-2 minutes;Round bright pink/orange objects in relation to each other. We saw two objects flying at the same speed and diagonal to one another.  At first, we thought perhaps they were airplanes, but as they continued to fly they didn't deter from they speed or relation to one another.  They were both round, as far as we could tell, and bright pink/orange in color.  The lower left one blinked a few times, then the other one did and then, they both just disappeared. They were a good distance apart, perhaps a mile? There were no clouds for the light to be hidden behind.  They did not have trails behind them like a flare or fireworks.   There was no sound either. They where above houses but below the average airplane flying height typical in our area.  We are wondering if there were any satellites in the area?  We are of sound mind. I do have a video, but it's very shaky and hard to see.  I did a still image and it looks like an orb of light or oval of light.  If you are interested in seeing it, please let me know.  Thank you.;45.21;-93.6607
