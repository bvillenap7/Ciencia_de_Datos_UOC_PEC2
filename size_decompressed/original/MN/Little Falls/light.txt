We both saw a light traveling through the clouds then two more lights followed, each light about 2 or 3 seconds apart. They were traveling quite fast and were about 800 feet above us.  There was no noise or any change in direction.  We only saw each light for about 3 seconds each.  We only saw the light through the dark clouds in the sky.  I really don't believe in extraterestrial UFOs, but I know this wasn't an ordianary experience.;45.9811;-94.3639
Thought I saw a satellite right above me until it stopped and making turns in different directions.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-19 21:00:00;30 minutes;Thought I saw a satellite right above me until it stopped and making turns in different directions. Directly above.  Thought it was a satellite until it stopped and moved almost opposite direction.  Would stop periodically and change direction.  This repeated for about 10 minutes above me.  Then b-lined it northwest and made a L-turn west where it finally came to a stop and would move around and stop again and again like it did when it was above me.  During this whole time it was changing colors from green, red, white, and yellow.  Also noticed 3 different aircraft moving towards it when the clouds started coming.  My girlfriend saw it with me, I called my parents and they saw it.   I also called my brother who lives almost a half hour away and he didn't know what to think when he finally saw it after my directions on finding it.  It was about in the  8 o'clock direction from the big dippers handle.  It was very high in the sky.  Like I said I thought it was a satellite but clearly it was not.  I lost sight due to clouds moving in.  I did take pictures with a 30 second shutter speed when it was out on the west until the clouds moved in.

Bright craft travels thousands of mph, in and out of view from Minnesota night sky.;2019-05-25 00:20:00;6 seconds;Bright craft travels thousands of mph, in and out of view from Minnesota night sky. I went outside while at work to vape, and stared at the stars like I always do, and out of the corner of my left eye, I saw something moving fast, very high in the sky.  It looked exactly like a star, but it went all the way across the sky from all the way left to all the way right, until it vanished, continuing on its straight path, it went across the entire night sky in approximately 6 seconds, it was not a plane, or any kind of satellite.  The speed of this craft was absolutely intense, it wasn't a shootting star or anything like that, because it moved so straight and at such a maintained speed.  It was literally passing over dozens of stars every second.  There were no flashing lights of any kind, it was at bright and the same size as the stars in the sky.  It moved in a solid straight line, I am seriously still in shock.  Wow.;45.9811;-94.3639
