Driving down hwy 10 heading south from Brainard, MN, I noticed 5 very bright lights just over some tree tops and didn't see it again for another 10 min then I seen it very clearly, maybe 200' off the ground going slightly faster than me at 65 mph.  It went away and I took my next available exit where I seen it coming straight towards me.   I got out of my vehicle to watch it fly over my head. It was triangle almost boomerang shaped with a roughly 20-30' wingspan from my point of view, with 5 lights on the front like headlights on a car but very bright and big it was to dark to tell what the tail end looked like when it flew over me.  The sound of it sound like someone going shhhhhhhhhhh quietly.  I'm not saying this thing was from outer space I just couldn't identify this thing from anything I've ever seen.
