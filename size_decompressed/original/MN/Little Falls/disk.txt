Was watching a jet fly at a high altitude talking about how the jet stream drops giving the appearance that the jet is gaining altitude.  Blue sky with a few clouds.   Many feet below the jet moving the opposite direction a disc shaped object appeared traveling what looked to be faster than the jet.  Appeared for about 5 to 10 sec then dissapeared.  Not behind a cloud or anything.   Afterward,s not really believing what we saw, we watched the jet making the observation that we could clearly see the body and wings of the plane at such a high altitude, but this object had no wings just round disc shaped.   The sun did reflect off the disc if that is worth mentioning.   Wish I would have taken a pic but was a little shocked.;45.9811;-94.3639
