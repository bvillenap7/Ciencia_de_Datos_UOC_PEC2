Unidentified Object hovering over Grasston, Minnesota;2012-09-25 03:30:00;25 minutes;Unidentified Object hovering over Grasston, Minnesota On the morning of September 25th, approximately 3:30am I observed green and white flickering lights.  Upon closer examination using my binoculars I witnessed an object hovering above the trees a couple miles from my home. This object had 4 rectangular window like lights on the side that were mostly green and white but streaking across the object. This object zigzagged above the trees and hovered for about 15 minutes and then turned on its side to reveal a perfect circle shape which had lights all the way around the outside edges.  It hovered that way for only a few seconds before returning to its previous position. It continued to hover for approximately 10 more minutes before I notice airplanes moving towards the object. The planes were approaching from the south when the object slowly started to lift higher above the trees then completely vanished.;45.7175;-93.2037
