Three craft in a triangle shape flashing red blue and orange;2020-06-23 01:50:00;10 minutes;Three craft in a triangle shape flashing red blue and orange We went outside at 1:50am when I noticed to the SSW three points of light in a triangle pattern. The highest point in the triangle was flashing blue, red, and orange for about 2 minutes while the lower right and left objects remained solid white as if they were stars. It slowed and faded, when the one to the lower right and left of the triangle began to mimic the light pattern for another 2 minutes. The object on the right disappeared first and moved underneath the bottom left object and continued flashing. That object flashed for a minute and then disappeared. About a minute later, the upper middle light disappeared. The lower left light remained for an additional minute before disappearing.  I am a 33 year old mother of two who works full-time. My sonâ€™s 33 year old stay at home father was also present at the time. I had asked him to tell me if I was crazy or if he was seeing what I was seeing. I am an avid stargazer that is very familiar with the differences in satellites, airplanes (commercial and military), stars, meteors, etc.;46.7546;-92.5408
