I started watching it and would dim and then get bright and the disappear and reappear we watched it until we got home and got of car and watched.  It kept doing it and then all of a sudden you could see a diamond shape.  Also, we looked opposite of house a saw a object flashing blue and red moving slow.  Also, the diamond shaped object once split into 2 pieces and back together.  We are freaking out!;46.7546;-92.5408
