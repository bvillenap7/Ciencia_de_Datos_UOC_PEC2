Multiple UFOs sighted in Albertville MN on July 2 2011;2011-07-02 15:00:00;1 hour;Multiple UFOs sighted in Albertville MN on July 2 2011 An approaching severe weather event caught my attention.  I looked outside and was shocked to see clouds like I'd never seen before.  There was an arrow shaped cloud jutting out in front of an apparent funnel cloud.  I quickly ran outside and saw what appeared to be a face with an arrow in front of it, sort of like an ancient carving or something.  I captured video of this whole event.  The storm proceeded with zero rain at first, but a near touchdown of an apparent tornado which I captured on video. Since then I've had what can best be described as demonic oppression symptoms.  I decided to go over the footage again, as this general date was the time I started to have unexplained symptoms.  To my shock, i captured 1 fast moving rod shaped UFO, a shocking cloud of obvious faces in a cumulonimbus cloud that spawned a 'funnel', a craft appearing out of the funnel, an object shooting upward in the foreground skyward into the clouds, reptile faces and shapes in the sti! ll photos, and weird centipede-shaped organisms or beings.  The crafts can best be seen when the hue is inverted in the video. It is obvious with sharp edges and landing gear style legs that appear.  It seems to change shape at will.  The foreground in the video seems to have anomalies like a hologram or something is interrupting the field of vision.;45.2502;-93.6487
