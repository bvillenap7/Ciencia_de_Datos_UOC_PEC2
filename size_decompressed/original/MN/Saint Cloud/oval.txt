The sky was clear and I only saw one car coming from the opposite direction. The object went totally straight, east to west then vanished with a blink of an eye.  I was in the Air Force for 20 years and have seen numerous aircraft day and night flying and know what I saw was no normal aircraft or object. I also have seen numerous shooting stars and know that this was unusual. The object was 200 to 500 ft up.;45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546
Two orange objects fly from south to north proceeding a helicopter with a spotlight hovering near the area.;2015-08-21 22:05:00;5-10 minutes;Two orange objects fly from south to north proceeding a helicopter with a spotlight hovering near the area. We were coming back from a movie on Highway 23 heading toward the east side of St. Cloud where our home is, and we spotted a helicopter light.  The helicopter was hovering and then turned its search light on, panning it up in the sky.  The helicopter hovered in an area over the east side of St. Cloud, near highway 10 for roughly two to three minutes.  We pulled over in a church parking lot to film the helicopter when the two of us spotted an orange oval object heading fast from south to north.  It cleared the trees and I panned my camera over to film it.  The helicopter did not seem interested in the object, and headed west.  We lost track of the object in the clouds, as it headed north.  We then got back onto highway 23 heading back west to St. Cloud to see where the helicopter was.  By now it was on the far west side of town. We drove back to our home and as we were pulling up in the parking lot, another orange object appeared from the south, heading north just like the previous object.  Both this and the previous object had flickers to them, and were moving fairly quick. Also, it should be of note we spotted what looked like a normal plane at high altitude shortly after the second sighting.  It was heading northwest and had blinking lights as a traditional plane would. There has been a lot of smoke in the sky lately from fires, and the moon was out.  Video was taken of both objects and the helicopter.;45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546
