Between the out buidings I viewed an Red/Orange light about 5 feet off the ground in a hay field about 3 blocks away,  It hoovered there untill I yelled for my brother who was coming out of the main entrance of our house.  It went strait up in a clear blue sky at tremendous speed.  It was a glowing red,round object.   This was years before encounters of a third kind, and the next time I saw something like that,where the objects in that movie.  What was it that I saw,has anybody witnessed the same, Thanks;45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546

12 Large Bright Red-Orange Lights fly over Central Minnesota on the evening of April 28th, 2012.;2012-04-28 19:00:00;15 minutes;12 Large Bright Red-Orange Lights fly over Central Minnesota on the evening of April 28th, 2012. On April 28, 2012, about 7pm in the evening, .2 separate squadrons of 6 red-orange oblong (20-40ft. in size) lights flew slowly in a northerly direction over the city of St. Cloud, MN, at about 1000ft. altitude under the cloud cover. Each light moved independently but all on the same course, then one by one, each bright light flew north at a very high rate speed becoming a pin point of light and arcing up into the clouds. My friend and I were about a mile away and there was no sound from the lights, the light was bright and a color I have never seen on any aircraft, a continuous light.  I did not see any physical craft in the lights, no smoke , no contrails, no sound.  The lights seemed to appear from no where as a group flying at the speed of single engine airplane and later at very high speed, I heard no sonic boom either, I am in my 50â€™s and I have never seen anything like these flying bright red-orange lights, I have seen squadrons of jet fighters flying at high altitude at night, airshows, and life-time of observing aircraft including supersonic jets and sonic booms all of which looked  and sounded nothing like these flying lights.

Moving lights in Minnesota sky disappearing into what appeared to be a trail of smoke.;2020-03-07 20:00:00;2 hours;Moving lights in Minnesota sky disappearing into what appeared to be a trail of smoke. The first thing we noticed was a weird trail of smoke almost appearing as though a rocket had been shot off or crashed.  We went to follow the smoke first, but then saw these weird lights that almost looked like moving stars.  They were very synced in their movements.  One would fly off into this trail of smoke (still in the sky for over 30 minutes) then it would disappear.  The next would follow, and so on.  As they enter this what appeared to be a trail of smoke they would disappear.  The trail of smoke would then shift and became larger in the sky.  We watched this happen for 2 hours consecutively.;45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546
