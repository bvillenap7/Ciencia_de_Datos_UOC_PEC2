One becomes three three becomes six.;2012-10-15 22:00:00;30 seconds;one becomes three three becomes six. I  was standing in the savers parking lot waiting for my girlfriend to get off work when I found myself looking out into  the night sky just over the top of the building  when I noticed  one white orb traveling rather  fast horizontally through the sky.   the one orb  suddenly split into three.   the three orbs travelled in formation side by side  for a few seconds.   three more shot up vertically almost as if joining the formation. when the three horizontally flying orbs met up with the vertically flying orbs they formed  a tight formation and shot vertically out of view in the blink of an eye. my description does my encounter no justice as it was truly one of the most unbelievable things I have ever seen.
