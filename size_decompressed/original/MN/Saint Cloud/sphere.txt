2 orange balls connected with 7 others to become one and fly away at a high rate of speed..;1997-07-15 03:00:00;10 minutes;2 orange balls connected with 7 others to become one and fly away at a high rate of speed.. I got up around 3 am to have a cigarette and walked into the porch and noticed that it was very still outside and everything looked like a hazy orange color. The air was heavy and still  ..Why I'm writing this is to see if anybody else saw what I did. Heretofor:  Two objects orange in color, round, and moving very fast as if chasing each other were moving east to west towards the Mississippi river. I couldn't believe what I saw and ran in to tell my then girlfriend what I just witnessed. After talking with her I went back out and looked in the direction that they flew and 9 objects were coming from west to east in exactly the same fashion and probably the same level in the sky. They were in two groups...One was 5 and following were 4 objects.. They were all moving around each other as if to be playing tag of sorts.. Then at an angle of about 15 degrees they all came together to form one complete ball and at a 60 to 80 degree angle they flew much faster and went out of sight.... Nothing was reported that I know of to any paper or other reporting agency the following day...  I know what I saw wasn't a plane because the next day I stood in the exact same spot and saw an airplane moving in approximately the same direction and it wasn't anywhere near as fast.  The time the moved from east to west and then again from west to east was each about 3 to 5 seconds... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

This time I saw what looked to be spherical, and in the broad daylight!!;2004-07-12 18:30:00;one minute;This time I saw what looked to be spherical, and in the broad daylight!! My whole life I have searched the heavans looking for things that ought not be there.  Up until about 7 weeks ago, no such luck...t least not anything I could come up with as a better explanation.  This is my third report in two months.   I saw a sphere slowly moving across the sky for a minute.  It was highly reflective, or had a little light coming of of it.  It proceeded to cross in front of a cloud, I watched as it passed by the cloud for about 10 seconds, then it disappeared from sight,  I watched for the next couple of minutes, in case it entered the cloud, but it didn't reappear.  The object at no time had a comtrail.;45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546
Orange ball of light over St. Cloud, MN.;2014-03-23 19:10:00;3 minutes;Orange ball of light over St. Cloud, MN. The sky was still clear and blue as it was getting dark.   There was 1 flame colored orange ball of low intensity light moving south over south St. Cloud, MN.   Moving very slowly silently and appearing to coast to a stop, it began to move again seconds later and seem to rise and disappear as if entering a haze and fading out completely.   There were no other lights around it as an aircraft would display.   Iâ€™m quite sure the object was visible for at least several minutes before it first caught my eye.;45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546
