Red orblike lights moving across the nights sky.;2012-04-28 21:38:00;15 minutes;Red orblike lights moving across the nights sky. I saw about 15 red glowing orbs moving smoothly across the sky from Southeast toward northwest.  One of them that was flying overhead at one point turned the lights off and all you could see was a black object circular.  It reminded me of watching a flock of birds fly how they go into a v pattern then become a straight line.  There were no bonfires, airshows of any kind going on at the time. The observer is a Certified Veterinary Tech.  With a degree in Biology. Currently working at a Hospital.;45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546
Orange, shiny object, 8 p.m., in the night sky (St. Cloud, MN), came closer and closer until gradually fading away.;2012-12-24 20:00:00;20 seconds;Orange, shiny object, 8 p.m., in the night sky (St. Cloud, MN), came closer and closer until gradually fading away. My daughter (age 18) and myself were driving home at 8 p.m. when we happened to see a large orange (circular?) object coming through the night sky.  It wasn't like a plane, more like a helicopter, but moved faster and was a shiny-orange color.   All of a sudden, though, it seemed to get smaller and smaller, finally disappearing. We've never seen anything like this before! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546
Orange colored circle low in sky.;2013-10-08 20:00:00;1 hour;Orange colored circle low in sky Multi-colored circle low in sky.  About 200 feet off the ground.  Not moving and no sound.  Used video camera to catch footage of a rotating circle shape with many colors.  From a distance, it was orange.  In the video it had 10 colors and the shape was spinning quickly clockwise.   After a hour, the object shot straight into the air.   We have been seeing this same shape come and go for the past month.  It appears about once a week.  Always in a different location, but within a mile of the last sighting.  We have drove to where we think the location is, and there isn't anything there but farms.  Nothing high enough in the air to make this light form.  Continuing to do research on this daily.;45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546
I believe in aliens is just not them coming to earth.  I swear this was an ufo.;2013-10-09 21:07:00;15 seconds;I believe in aliens is just not them coming to earth.  I swear this was an ufo. I was taking my dog outside to go potty.  I saw a circular shape with a lite light in the front of it.  No blinking lights no noise was made by the craft.  I saw the shape go across the sky maybe 15 seconds.   This craft went fast and smooth.  I saw an airplane also in the sky and the two are way different.
