I notice a low flying craft at about 300 hundred feet above the ground to my left thru drivers side window, I thought this is strange because there is a tall power line system that reaches at least 150 ft to 200 ft. off the ground in its path.  This craft was moving towards my direction left to right with the power lines directly in its path. It was not a plane its lights were yellow, no white, green, or red.  No flashing light either, just solid yellow. This was no plane or helicoptor, I turned raio off, open windows and slowed down, no traffic around but me so I was able to hear well, no sound from this craft as it past over my car.  This was a strange craft, I believe it was a U.F.O.;45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546
