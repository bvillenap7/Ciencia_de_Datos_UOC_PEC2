Dimly lit Boomerang shaped object in St. Cloud, Minnesota;2002-11-07 19:40:00;20 seconds;Dimly lit Boomerang shaped object in St. Cloud, Minnesota I was bringing the trash to the curb, when I noticed an object hovering above.. kind of like a boomerang shaped object, dimly lit.. I could just barely make out the outline against the night sky.  In the center was a dimly lit round red window or light.. the object appeared to be a couple hundred feet high perhaps 70-100 feet from tip to tip while hovering the object made a slight circular motion.  The circles became larger in diameter it then made a spiraling maneuver and sped off like a bullet to the south over the trees in the woods behind my house. (I live on a wooded 1-acre lot in a semi-metropolitan area).  This whole time, the object made no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));45.5569925925923;-94.1846209876546
Two possible craft seen in the mid-afternoon sky following the Mississippi;2004-07-16 12:45:00;7 minutes approx;Two possible craft seen in the mid-afternoon sky following the Mississippi I might be looking too hard but I just saw another one.  It flew as gracefully as a bird, incidentally one of the reasons this may be a misidentification.  The craft was in the shape of a black wing.  It flew  around in circles first up the Mississippi toward me, asscending some.  At its closest point, I saw what seemed to be manufactured rather than somethin of God's hand.  If it was a bird, it would have been close enough to make out more clearly.  I could see that it was shaped as a wing, and looked further off.   Then for about four minutes, I watched as it turned and moved southward away from me along the river.  During the ladder half of this encounter, it was joined by a smaller object, along the treeline.  Taking thermals into account, this corse makes me wonder if I did see anything this time, after all if I did, then its the second time this week.  I also made a report on Tuesday.
