Slow moving diamond shaped flame.;2013-12-27 19:40:00;2 minutes;Slow moving diamond shaped flame. I was driving on highway 7 past Hutchinson (right before Silverlake) - heading East. The flame moved steadily across my path north to south.   I pulled over and watched it slowly pass over the road about 60 feet overhead.  It was a flame with a glow above and below it, but not other parts seen.  I was very overwhelmed and moved by what I saw.  Nobody believes me.  I looked extra hard to make sure I was seeing accurately. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.894;-94.3839
