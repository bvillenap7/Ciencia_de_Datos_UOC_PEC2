Hovering aircraft;2011-01-12 19:35:00;10 minutes;Hovering aircraft   I was outside on my balcony smoking a cigarette and I saw this bright light hovering in the sky.  I looked at it for a few seconds and then I went in and got my aunt. She said that was just a star so she got her star map on her phone out.  She was inside trying to find it on her star map and she was not able to see it.  As she was doing that I looked at her and said it was moving slowly horizontally in a diagonal way.  She came outside with me and watched it.  As it got higher in the sky the bright light changed to red lights.  It was moving towards the west for a few seconds gaining speed and then it turned around and was going south.   The lights on the object started to change different colors as it did this I heard a loud noise that continued.   We stayed and watched it for about 4 minutes and then looked away for about 20 seconds and it was gone.;44.894;-94.3839
