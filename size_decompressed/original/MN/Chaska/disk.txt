2 lights (seen later in pictures as crafts).;2013-11-18 17:58:00;10 seconds;2 lights (seen later in pictures as crafts) I encountered 2 lights above my roof while sitting in my car waiting for my husband to come outside.  There were stars out but these two lights caught my eye because they were bright and close together and they moved too.   They were keeping the formation of as they moved south over my house but must have been moving quickly as I accidentally took a picture first and then tried to video but they seem to fade off in the distance so quickly about 10 seconds on a clear night with no trees or buildings in the way.   When I went back to look at the picture and video, I didn't see anything on the video as usual. However when my camera had taken a picture with the flash on, I was able to zoom in close enough to make out a disc shape of the two lights.  But the lights didn't look like lights this time but more like reflections;44.8058;-93.6071000000001
