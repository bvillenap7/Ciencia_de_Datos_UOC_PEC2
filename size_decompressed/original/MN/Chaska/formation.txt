Seen by 7 people It was a cloudy nigh with no stars, planet, or moon in site.  My brother, sister, and dad were enjoying a Father's Day dinner from our gazebo on my deck which faces the south but has a view to the west and east.  What I figured about 10:20pm my sister and brother had gone inside and when they came back out to the deck my brother turned to his left and yelled, What is that?!?  My initial thought was a a plane but I will look.  From inside my gazebo I leaned down to see and saw 3 very large orange lights hovering in a triangle formation silently in the sky to our west.  My dad and I quickly exited the gazebo and joined my sister and brother to run down to the yard to get a better view.  That's when I noticed there were 4 and they were in a diamond shape.   I called my neighbor over who was outside with her granddaughter and her friend.  They joined us and we all watched for about 30 seconds as one by one they seemed to ascend into the clouds.  By the time ! we saw them hovering the whole event was about a minute and a half.  I'm sure they were there longer as they seemed to just be hanging out. I am going to report this to my local newspaper to see if anyone else reported anything.  I did try to get a video with my phone but even on the clearest night with the moon shining bright the images are very difficult to see if at all. I did get one pinpoint size on camera but I was shaking and running to much to get any more focused. I was more interested in watching with my eyes, not trying to focus my camera.;44.8058;-93.6071000000001
