Large, white ringed, low flying, slow moving object at tree level.;2020-04-19 21:00:00;10 seconds;Large, white ringed, low flying, slow moving object at tree level. April 19th 2020. Chaska, MN, going North on County Road 41/Hazeltine Blvd just south of  Lyman Blvd.  Dark, clear night with visible stars.  Going East to West a large, low flying, slow moving, very distinctive white ring with a lighter, thinner inside moved towards me in the front of my windshield, then turned South so I could see it out of my driver side window.  I pulled over at the next corner to look at it, but it had disappeared.  If I try to put a size and location of it Iâ€™d say it was just over the tree level and large enough to fit 2 cars side by side within the ring.;44.8058;-93.6071000000001
Glowing orange orbs disappearing and reappearing in the distance sky.;2020-05-02 22:00:00;20-30 minutes;Glowing orange orbs disappearing and reappearing in the distance sky. We were sitting in our east facing backyard last night when sometime after 10:00 pm I noticed a glowing orange light in the south east direction.  The light hovered and was moving slightly for about a minute and then slowly faded away.  Several minutes later, two orange lights appeared from the south and rose to the same spot from before.  They hovered and moved slightly for up to two minutes before slowly fading and disappearing.  This same occurrence repeated for approximately 30 minutes, with the lights hovering for several minutes and then disappearing for several minutes.  Sometimes it was one light and sometimes it was two lights.  I would describe them as glowing orange orbs.;44.8058;-93.6071000000001
