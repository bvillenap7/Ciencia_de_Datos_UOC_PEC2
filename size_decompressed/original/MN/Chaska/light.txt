Solid red light, 80 degree fast turn, faster than an airplane.  Not a meteor or airplane maneuvers.;2005-04-18 22:00:00;20 seconds;Solid red light, 80 degree fast turn, faster than an airplane.  Not a meteor or airplane maneuvers. I watch planes all the time and meteors.  I've actually reported seeing my first UFO sighting in 2011, Aug 23 or 26, is when i saw it at night.   Incredible speed at such 90 degree angles.  That one was a solid white light.   This one was very red, moved faster than a plane.  Solid red light.   Took a quick 80 degree turn before i lost sight behind trees, but could not see it afterwards.  There is an airport in another city, but I see their lights and flight paths.  This one was too fast, solid, tight fast turn.;44.8058;-93.6071000000001
Bright light quickly fading to orange then disappearing;2005-07-16 03:00:00;5 seconds;Bright light quickly fading to orange then disappearing Going to bed late one night I laid in bed around 3am and turned on my left side and looked out my window directly behind my head to the southwest sky.  There I saw a very bright light and quickly thought, that has got to be a really bright planet.  As soon as that thought crossed my mind it looked as though the object turned and the color faded from bright yellow to a QUICKLY fading orange color and continued to fade as it traveled northeast until it completely disappeared.  This all happened in about 5 seconds. I have lived in Chaska for about 10-months and am very familiar with the night sky as far as planet locations and star formations and that's why I was caught off guard when I saw this light as it seemed out of the ordinary.  I have also seen plenty of satellites, shooting stars, airplanes, and helicopters and this was none of those, guaranteed. I hope others will feel encouraged to post what they see especially those in or around Chaska, MN so I feel like my vision was validated although I don't deny what I saw to myself.;44.8058;-93.6071000000001
These  things hovered and moved north;2012-11-16 18:00:00;~30 minutes;these  things hovered and moved north I have no idea what the heck is going on in the western skys but tonite the light appeared in the sky still for a few minutes then drifted north.  Shortly 2 more lights appeared one above the other. Top one moved north minutes later lower oner moved north.  This continued for a very long time with 2 lights coming up in the west sky amd one at a time moving north/northwest. This kept repeating for approx 30inutes or more.  Not the first time i have seen this but for sure the most crafts i have ever seen ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
