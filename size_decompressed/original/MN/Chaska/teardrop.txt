Silver tear drop shape object moving at a high rate of speed from north to south.;2010-10-06 14:40:00;5 seconds;Silver tear drop shape object moving at a high rate of speed from north to south. I was in my front room sitting on the floor playing with my daughter.  We have a big window that faces west.  At 14:40 I looked out the window and saw a silver object, tear drop shape move across the sky from north to south.  It appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed.  I had a full view of it for approximately 2 second and then was partially obstructed by a small 15' tree we have in our front yard.  The object was still visible due to leaves being off this tree.  The whole incident lasted approximately 5 seconds.  We do have commercial airlines that typically fly from west to east into Mpls/St.Paul Airport.  We also have a small community airport in the city of Eden Prairie which is east of where I live.  Those planes are easily identified due to low elevation they are in for landing or take off.  It definitely was not a commercial or private aircraft.  I also called the Carver Co. Sheriffs office to see if there were any other reports, there were non! e nor did I file a report. I am in the medical field currently on disability due to on the job injury.  I was not on any pain medication at the time.;44.8058;-93.6071000000001
