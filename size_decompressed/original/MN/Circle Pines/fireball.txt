Bright light in the sky with burning material falling from it;2013-07-27 03:55:00;2 minutes;bright light in the sky with burning material falling from it I am a professional helicopter pilot.  I left the Army as a Chief Warrant Officer 3 after 10 years of service.  I flew attack helicopters in Iraq and Afghanistan and am familiar with many types of military aircraft and ordinance.   I was driving my car southwest in Circle Pines, MN at 0355 Central Time on 27July2013 and spotted a very bright light to the Southeast at an angle of approximately 25 degrees above the horizon.  It appeared to be stationary.   I pointed it out and my wife commented that it must be a planet since it was so much brighter than the stars.  It was similar in appearance to a planet but seemed much larger than usual.   I then witnessed burning objects fall from the light and extinguish midair.  This happened twice.  The object then appeared to dim and move northeast.   I looked away as I was driving for about 10 seconds.  When I looked back, it was gone.   It was similar in appearance to a military illumination flare, but it maintained it's altitude and moved horizontally.  The total viewing time was about 2 minutes.;45.1504;-93.148
