flaring white light;2000-06-09 23:00:00;15 sec.;flaring white light We were sitting outside when a white light, which was at that moment stationary, gradually flared very bright and large.  It was perfectly silent and seemed far away even when it was at its largest.  Then it reduced its size and emanation and began moving--it must have been very fast because it seemed like it was moving outward into space.  It grew smaller and disappeared in a very small distance from where it had been stationary.  Exactly 2 weeks later and at just about the same time we saw it again, exactly as we'd seen it the first time. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting is consistent with the flare of an Iridium satellite.
