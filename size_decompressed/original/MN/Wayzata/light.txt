HE PULLED OVER AND WE WATCHED.  THE LIGHTS  JUST SAT THERE FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES.  AFTER A WHILE MY GRANDPA GOT TIRED OF WATCHING IT AND WE LEFT. ON DECEMBER 24, 1990,  MY GRANDPA WAS DRIVING ME HOME FROM A CHRISTMAS PARTY, AND ABOUT 3/4 OF A MILE AWAY FROM HIS HOUSE, HE SAW LIGHTS IN THE SKY.  HE PULLED OVER OFF HIGHWAY 12 AND WE WATCHED THE LIGHTS JUST SIT THERE FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES.  HE PUT THE WINDOW DOWN AND WE LISTED AND WE COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.  THEN HE PUT THE WINDOW UP BECAUSE IT WAS SO COLD.  WE WATCHED AND WATCHED. IT JUST SAT THERE SILENT AND IT DIDN'T MOVE.  I THINK THAT THERE WERE 14 LIGHTS.  MY GRANDPA TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY SANTA CLAUSE AND I BELIEVED HIM UNTIL I STARTED TO HEAR ABOUT UFO's.  I COULD ONLY SEE LIGHTS.  THERE WAS A THIN CLOUD COVER AND IT WAS DARK OUT SIDE SO I COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT.  THE LIGHTS WERE SO BRIGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THE SIZE OF MY HAND.  THEY WERE NOT IN ANY PATTERN.  THEY WERE JUST SCATTERED ABOUT THE SKY.  THEY WERE NOT STARS I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THEY WERE FAR TOO LARGE AND BRIGHT.  AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES MY GRANPA PULLED BACK ON TO THE ROAD AND WE LEFT.;44.9847;-93.5422
