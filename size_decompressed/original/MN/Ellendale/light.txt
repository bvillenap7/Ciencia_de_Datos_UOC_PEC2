Light coming from hyperspace and slowing to a normal speed with no sound and observed for 3 min.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS??  PD));2007-06-08 21:30:00;3 minutes;Light coming from hyperspace and slowing to a normal speed with absolutely no sound and observed for 3 minutes I live in a farming community in Minnesota.  Our house sits one half mile off of a county road.  I was walking our driveway tonight as I do several times a week. As I was heading east a sphere of light appeared to come in from hyperspace to a normal flying speed. It was heading west faster than an airplane, but slower than a jet.  I would estimate my distance at about a half a mile away. I stopped to watch.  There was no sound. Where our house is located is a flight path for the local airport.  So I know that sound always follows an airplane. There was no sound ever. Then all of the local dogs in our area started barking. You can hear barking dogs from miles away. As the light started heading north, I kept looking for the light to change in intensity or disappear the way headlights would change on an airplane at different angles. I even tried to find blinking lights. There was never a change in the brightness of the light. The sphere remained the same intensity, as it was when I first saw it in the east head-on. I watched it head into the north until it disappeared into the clouds. Listening to the dogs barking farther and farther away. I am a veteran of the Air Force intel from 1974 - 1977. I held a top secret cryptologic/cryptographic clearance. ((NUFORC Note:  A flare from an Iridium satellite was visible in this area at 22:30 hrs., and the ISS passed overhead at about the same time.  We wonder if the time estimate above is accurate, or whether it might be an hour off.  PD));43.8865;-93.3185
