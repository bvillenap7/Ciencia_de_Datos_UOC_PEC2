I have been a star gazer my whole life and ive seen many satelites and shooting stars and many airplanes fly across the night sky,I worked for a major airline for five years so I am very familar with planes and how fast they move across the sky and these lights were not any airplane Know of, In fact they seemed to move three to four times as fast as a plane crusing at 40,000 feet. It couldnt have been more than five minutes, and they crossed the entire sky twice. The lights appeared to be the same size as an average star and if I had to guess at the elevation I would say they were as high as our satelites. there were no sounds emmiting from them, and if a jet flys over here I always heere them.
