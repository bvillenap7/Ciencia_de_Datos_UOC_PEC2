We were looking through a telescope at mars and a white light passed just above mars.  At first we thought it was a satallite.  As it got further away it slowed and eventually stopped moving altogether.  I've seen satellites before and I've never seen one do what this object did.

Ufo in small town MN.;2012-11-13 20:30:00;1-2 minutes;Ufo in small town MN My dad and I were standing on our back deck looking through the telescope. It was aimed just above the tree line by maybe 10-15 feet.  All of a sudden the blue-white light flashed through the eyepiece.  I looked up and there it it was.  My first thought was, They, a satellite!   It moved over the tree line and after crossing a side street it decelerated very rapidly. It hovered for maybe 5-10 seconds and just vanished.   I logged on to a satellite tracker and found our area.  There were no satellite overpass times. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));44.9588;-93.8505
