A family of three witness two quck flashes, then a VERY fast, dramatic fireball streak west in the night sky.;2003-07-27 22:00:00;5 sec.;A family of three witness two quck flashes, then a VERY fast, dramatic fireball streak west in the night sky. Telephoned Report:  A man, his wife, and their daughter were driving to the east on Highway 5, and were approximately 15 miles to the east of St. Paul, MN.  Suddenly, all three witnessed observed a momentary bright flash in the northern sky, approximately 60 degrees to the left of the centerline of their vehicle, and above the tops of the trees to their left, maybe 30 degrees above the horizontal plane.  Approximately two seconds after the first flash, with their attention focused on the area of the sky where it had just occurred, they witnessed a second, similar flash.  At almost the exact instant that they witnessed the second flash, they also observed a large fireball streak from east to west in the same area of the sky where they had just observed the two flashes.  It was a very dramatic flash, and the fireball was moving VERY fast, according to the father's account of the incident. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be quite sincere and credible.  PD));45.0639795918368;-92.8453653061224

After the lights disappeared a large jet sound reached our ears.;45.0639795918368;-92.8453653061224
A bright orange and red craft (fireball) moved in night sky, approx 10 minute duration. Until finally disappearing into night sky.;2016-07-03 23:00:00;10 minutes;A bright orange and red craft (fireball) moved in night sky, approx 10 minute duration. Until finally disappearing into night sky. My friends and I were driving around and saw a smallish red and orange fireball that moved a lot like an airplane appeared on the Wisconsin side of the St.Croix.  At first we believed it to be a firework, being that the sky is very active around this time of year.  Then after following it a couple of blocks the ball slowly disappeared into the night sky.  My friends thinking not much of it at the time,  but it peaked my interest and having a previous interest in the occult.  I decided to look up siting and when a saw a couple matching the same description as me I decided to submit this.;45.0639795918368;-92.8453653061224
