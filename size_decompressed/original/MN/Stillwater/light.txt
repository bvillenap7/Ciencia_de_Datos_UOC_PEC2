It looked light a plane light but it was brighter but it wouldn't move. It hovered for well over a half hour and is still there while I type this. I don't know any man made thing that can be that bright at that height without moving. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright lights over St. Croix River/Bayport area Minnesota;2010-01-28 20:30:00;15 minutes;Bright lights over St. Croix River/Bayport area Minnesota Driving toward  Stillwater on 1/27/10 and 1/28/10 about 8:30 pm, driving on Route 36 toward Wisconsin, noticed two bright lights similar to police  helicopters with searchlights hanging in the air just above the horizon in the distance, motionless, in the distance over the next town of Bayport near the power plant, or over the St. Croix River.  The first night, as we got nearer, the lights faded, one actually separated into two lights close together, one slightly higher than the other, and then both slowly got dimmer and disappeared.  Last night, the second night we were driving back the same way at the same time, and the lights were visible in the same place.  This time my husband and I were determined to get closer to them, so we drove down toward Bayport all the way to the river's edge, but lost them behind the trees while we were driving.  The planets Mars and Saturn were clearly visible higher up in the sky, unblinking, and were not these lights.  I will go ! back to the spot at 8:30 pm tonight with a camera and try to photograph it if the objects are visible.;45.0639795918368;-92.8453653061224
Very distant light blinking on and off at eight second intervals. Appeared to be as far away as the stars.;2012-10-09 02:20:00;5 minutes;Very distant light blinking on and off at eight second intervals. Appeared to be as far away as the stars. At 2:20 in the morning, while letting my dogs out, I saw a light in the South East sky, at approximately 60 degrees.  The light, which appeared to be at the distance and approximate brightness of a surrounding star, would blink on, for a duration of less than a second, and then blink off.  The light blinked on and off at eight to nine second intervals.  After approximately 10 -12 flashes, the light started moving slightly.  When the light would blink on, still at the same intervals, it was in a slightly different location, in the same area of the sky.  The light was bright and appeared to be very far away.  After about five minutes, the light turned off and never appeared again to me.;45.0639795918368;-92.8453653061224
Multiple slow moving white lights in sky all directions.  ((anonymous report));2016-10-20 20:45:00;15 minutes;Multiple slow moving white lights in sky all directions. Driving home, after dark, heading west, saw multiple moving lights in all directions.  Too slow and too many to be commercial airplanes.  Mostly one white light.  One in each cardinal direction was a red light.  One traveling NW to SE turned direction to come straight towards me.  Very bright forward light.   I turned off road, stopped car and opened window.  No sound from craft.  It then turned towards SE again and continued.   Told husband when got home and he had seen the same multiple moving lights while taking trash can down our long driveway.

Hot air balloon-esque lights moving slowly;2020-03-03 21:00:00;20 minutes;Hot air balloon-esque lights moving slowly 	At around 8:45pm I saw a bright object in the eastern sky, lower in the sky than a plane.  It was about the brightness of a planet.  It wasn’t moving, but it appeared to get brighter then dimmer periodically.  It also seemed to have a flashing light on it, but not like a plane’s flashing lights.  After not moving for a couple minutes, it began to slowly fly south-east and eventually disappear from my sight. Another bright object appeared near where the first one was in the east sky.  It started moving south-east as well.  I thought they might be police drones or something.  I went away to get binoculars.  When I came back there were five other bright objects hovering stationary over the eastern sky (where I initially saw the first object) and there was one light object coming slowly towards the rest from the north-east. In the stationary group of lights, there was one that suddenly became much brighter than the rest.  It looked like it had just caught fire.  The rest of the objects were still about as bright as planets and white/yellow in color, but this brightest object was now a red/orange color.  This happened shortly after 9 pm. A couple minutes passed, then the brightest object dimmed back to the color it originally was (the same color as the other objects).  The objects began to slowly disperse after this.  Three of them remained stationary and just faded away, and two of them began moving towards the south-east in the same direction as the first two objects I saw. 	These objects seemed to me like hot air balloons in how they changed in intensity of brightness, but they clearly were not hot air balloons because it was night.  When they were moving, they moved slowly and with constant motion.;45.0639795918368;-92.8453653061224
