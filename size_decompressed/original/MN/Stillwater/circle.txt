Orange light over Stillwater following the St. Croix River North (toward Forest Lake);2014-07-04 22:00:00;30-60 seconds;Orange light over Stillwater following the St. Croix River North (toward Forest Lake) I was sitting on a boat on the St. Croix River near the Stillwater bridge waiting for the 4th of July fireworks. It was around 10 o'clock when I saw this what appeared to be an Orange (I believe it was Orange, maybe orange and white) light drifting in the sky, it didn't appear to be very high, and it made no sound at all.  I know it wasn't a firework, or airplane, or helicopter. Whatever it was it was flying relatively slow and seemed to be following the river toward Forest Lake (heading North) very smoothly, I kept watching it drift off into the distance until it seemed to disappear.  I couldn't tell if it just got out of sight or if it took off rapidly.   My girlfriend was on the boat with me and she saw it too.;45.0639795918368;-92.8453653061224
