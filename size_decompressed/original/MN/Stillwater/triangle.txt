In fact it was the first night we were to stay here. Anyway, driving east I look out the passenger side window right beside me while my wife was driving and looking forward. I glanced up slightly and saw a huge bright light flying only a kilometer or so over the tree line. At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on but there is no airport near by. At closer investigation I saw that the brightest of the lights was in front of the craft and there were two more at the rear making a triangle shape. There was a blinking light directly at the bottom. While it was still a good distance from us I noticed a small light of some sort fall from underneath this thing.  As it came closer I thought about pointing it out to my wife. Just as I thought of telling her I heard her ask What is that? We slowed down and looked at it for several seconds as it lowered and finally became less illuminated. I could see clearly the side of the craft. It had what looked like windows wrapped around what I call the hull. Just when most of it was visible it lit up again very quickly and disappeared with a bright flash of light. No sooner than we saw this my wife started to almost scream when we saw two more directly in front of us. They all looked identical to the first one. Again I saw a light (almost looked like a meteorite) fall from the bottom of one of the other crafts. One all of a sudden appeared and went straight down in the east. We were speechless. We finally talked about it when we got to the apartment building only a mile from where we witnessed all of this. To say the least this was the weirdest thing either of us have ever experienced.

Triangular craft with red lights surrounding an orange center hovering and then retreating over hwy 95;2012-11-16 04:50:00;15 minutes;Triangular craft with red lights surrounding an orange center hovering and then retreating over hwy 95 My husband and I were driving on Highway 95 towards our home in Stillwater after work. The sky was mostly clear and many stars were visible, despite the bright lights of the city below. Listening quietly to a talk radio show while my husband drove, I gazed out the passenger side window of the car, not looking at anything specific, just mindlessly observing our surroundings. I then noticed ahead of us and slightly to the right of the highway a particularly bright object in the sky. Though, as I stated, many stars were visible, at a certain point they became drowned out by the lights of civilization. The object that I saw was well below this line. It was also significantly brighter and larger than any of the stars I could see. While still staring curiously at the object, I asked my husband, “What is that?” and pointed to it. He responded that he had noticed it as well and was wondering the same thing. Upon more focused observation, I could discern that it was triangular in shape, and had red lights surrounding its yellow-orange center. It seemed to be in a fixed position hovering over the earth, but as we drove towards its general direction, we seemed to be getting closer to it.  I watched it for about 10 more minutes from the car window, and it continued to stay in the same place. We parked in a parking lot to watch it without the car moving. Then suddenly it seemed to jump back into space slightly. I saw the movement and then noticed that it was smaller and dimmer, as if it had retreated. From then on it continued to stay in its new position, hovering without movement. I took several photos with my cellphone camera, and though not the greatest quality, in one of them you can clearly see its shape and the red lights around the center. I cannot say I know for sure what it was. I just know that I saw something out of the ordinary and I have photos to prove it.;45.0639795918368;-92.8453653061224
Triangle with white lights.;2015-03-05 04:14:00;5 minutes;Triangle with white lights. Seen 1 hovering triangle craft about 500-1000 feet above ground, about the altitude a single engine air craft would fly for good scenic views.   The craft was silent.  Triangle had 3 bright white lights and 1 red flashing light.  Red light was in the center.   I had a better view of the craft as it came toward our car then the driver.  The white lights were flashing in a sequence/chase.  White lights were on each corner.   I could clearly see the craft and know it was not military or commercial/private.   After coming toward our car, it flew off south-west at a quick rate.   We were located on Ravine Circle about a mile west of Saint Croix River.  Craft looked as if it was hovering above the river, before coming toward our car.   I am enclosing a drawing of what I seen.  I am not a good artist, but it's what I remember.;45.0639795918368;-92.8453653061224
Black triangle with 3 white lights and center red light.;2015-03-05 04:14:00;5 minutes;Black triangle with 3 white lights and center red light. One black triangle object seen hovering low with 3 bright white lights 1 on each corner and 1 flashing red light in the center of the object.  Object was silent.   As a delivery driver with a partner, we were stopping very frequently, and happened to stop near the hovering craft, where you could clearly see the shape, color, and lights.  Upon being noticed by the craft, it flew quickly near our vehicle, there were no sounds, engine or otherwise.  It then sped away and disappeared to the south-west.  Flight pattern was not that of a normal air craft.  Maneuvering in manners that we have not seen normal air craft perform with high rate of speed.;45.0639795918368;-92.8453653061224
