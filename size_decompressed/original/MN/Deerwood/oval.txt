Two oval shaped objects were hovering near larson lake,  I said to my wife those are UFOs!  She wasnt convinced until they began moving at the same rate of speed over a swampy area about two telephone pole lengths above the tree tops and about an eight mile from us, they had window braces or some sort of seperation about 3 feet apart with a soft green glow inside like from an instrument panel.  They didnt move untill we watched them hover for about 10 seconds, they headed s.e. towards the Aitkin, Garrison area at the same rate of speed about 50 yards apart and at the same elevation, there was no white or red light on them. to guess their size or if they were connected together would be hard because of the darkness,  maybe about the size of those gondolas beneath a blimp. this was in a very rural area but near a farm.;46.4484;-93.8836000000001
