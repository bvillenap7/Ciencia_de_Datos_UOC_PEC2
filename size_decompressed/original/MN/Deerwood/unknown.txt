PD)) Sighting 3:  An incidence occurred in mid-October 1974.  I picked my son up from wrestling practice in the evening after school.  We lived out in the country at the time and as we were driving home, we came up a hill and just as we topped the hill and were going to go down the other side, an object came over our car just above our heads, so low and so fast that we both ducked down thinking something was going to strike us.  It encompassed the whole width of our peripheral vision appeared to be just above treetop level.   I jammed on the brakes and we jumped out and saw nothing behind us.  I then backed up to see if it could have been ground fog.  This time as we came back up the hill there was no evidence of any ground fog and the night was fairly clear as I recall.  We had no idea of what this could have been, but it was huge, shiny and was over and past us so fast that if there were lights visible, we could never have seen them.  Just another unsolved, unexplained mystery that remains imbedded in our memories. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));46.4484;-93.8836000000001
