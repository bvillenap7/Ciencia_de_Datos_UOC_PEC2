Ball of Fire over Ramsey, MN seen by 2.;2011-09-16 21:20:00;1 minute;Ball of Fire over Ramsey, MN seen by 2. My son (4 years old) and I were watching the city fireworks from our house.  We were on the sidewalk when a 'ball of fire' or 'bronze type fire' came floating half way from the  distance of the fireworks (approximation .5 miles - 1 mile  East of the fireworks).  I instantly took out my phone to video the object and right as I hit play the fire ball which seemed to be moving as a balloon would in the wind - simply vanished.  No noise.  I would have to believe a LOT of other people saw this thing considering it was during the city fire works!  I asked my son, Do you think that's an airplane and his response was exactly what I was thinking - that's not an airplane!  The object was a circle and looked like a glowing bronze fireball.  I viewed it for about 30-45 seconds before it disappeared.;45.2815;-93.4195
