Heading E on Hwy. 10 from Elk River and notice a light reflection on the Mississippi River.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2017-07-27 03:00:00;4 hours;I was coming heading east on highway 10 from Elk River and notices a light reflection on the Mississippi River and looked up and saw a strange light dancing on the tree line as if it seemed to follow me and stop when I stopped.  My significant other and I decided to pull off onto a county road and park.  To our surprise this light stopped above the tree line when we parked and we continued to watch it for over 4 hours.  Along with this light being the biggest we noticed over 10 star like lights coming around the pera meter  of this big stopped light.  These little lights were almost exactly like fireflies they ignited light and dimmed off and lit up and dimmed off.  (I'm 100 percent they were not actually fireflies!)   We watched this huge light stay above the treeline until the sun came up, when it seemed to slowly get higher and higher until you the sky was as light out as this unidentified flying light.  To describe this light I'm more detail it was yellow and pink in color and had a green light to the lower right of it.  It seemed to dance and or habe a flow to it.  It reminded me of a jellyfish.  As it got further into the sky it resembled a cross.  I've noticed this same light where I live in town.  It appears to pretend to be a star but moves short distances in a way where you wouldn't notice it.;45.2815;-93.4195
