I came back home and saw really bright blinking light, at first I thought it was a plane but than I realized  that this was flying much to close to ground level to be a plane and it just didn't have that plane look to it, most planes are usually far in the sky and have a red blinking light this one was oddly close and had no red light just three flashing white light blinking in order in a line first 1 than the other, followed by the third. It moved quickly before I could take a good look it was out of sight, I saw which direction it went so I followers went down the roads. a Couple minutes and stopped by an opened field I went out further into field away from light and looked for a good few minutes and saw nothing than right when I was about to leave I saw a flashing white light in the distance rich above the woods thats past the field.  It start getting bigger and brighter and closer and I again was closer than before, still couldn't identify the shape of the craft but I moved smoothly and quick and I thought I heard a faint hovering sound, eventually after stairing at it for good 2 minutes it flew out ve sight again I tried to follow it and find it but no luck this time.;45.2815;-93.4195
