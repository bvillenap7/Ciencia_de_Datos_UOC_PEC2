5 orange lights seen over Avon, Minnesota.;2011-05-16 00:30:00;4 min;5 orange lights seen over Avon, Minnesota. I saw 5 orange lights hover over my house for about 30 seconds without making any sound.   Then they flashed off for about 5 seconds and then came back on and started moving to the South West.    There was no definitive shape it seemed like 5 separate orange lights that could move independently.;45.6105;-94.4361
