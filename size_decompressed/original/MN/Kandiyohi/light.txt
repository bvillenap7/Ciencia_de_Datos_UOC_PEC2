Fiery orange ball of light seen hovering in night sky in countryside.;2018-01-12 21:00:00;10 minutes;Firey orange ball of light seen hovering in night sky in countryside. I was driving at night and was just looking up at the clear night sky, observing all the stars.  Off to my right side in my front windshield I noticed this bright orange light in the sky. I immediately thought it was just a really bright star.  As I was driving, I kept observing it, note there were no other cars around me and I was out in the country.  As I stared at it, it got brighter and brighter, it was a first orange.  All the sudden as I’m watching it, it’s as if someone turned off a light.  It just went out and never showed back up again.  It lasted a good 10 minutes. I watched it for awhile.  It moved slightly but mostly remained still in one place high in the sky.  I’m no stranger to sightings.;45.1437;-94.9184
