I was sitting our camping table, when I happened to notice a basketball size shape that glowed orange far in the sky.  I watched it, then told my nephew about it and he told me that him and my son both had noticed it a bit ago.  It never moved at that time.   I did not take a photo cause I thought it must be some planet or star that was only to be seen on that day, and would be all over Facebook.   After that thought and a minute or so after I noticed the object, the orange ball began to move away from our direction.  It traveled for 3-6 seconds and the object blinked 2-3 times and then disappeared.  I never seen the object again.   In awe, I went to ask my son if he had seen something in the sky.  My son 7 years of age then told me he and my nephew seen a orange ball and pointed to the direction of where I saw the object.  My son was not around my nephew and I when I noticed it and we watched it leave.  The object was in the sky and when it was moving it looked slow, but no plane I've seen could of went this distance in that amount of time.  This was around 5 pm on a sunny day.;44.2108;-92.6619000000001
