Very bright white light in SW sky over metro area, appeared to be round with light around it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2017-05-31 04:45:00;1 hour;Very bright white light in southwest sky over metro area, appeared to be round with light around it We were out enjoying the birds and the river early this morning and saw a very bright white light in the sky to the southeast.  After grabbing the binoculars we were able to see that it appeared to be a round or oval shape which had lights around it.  I did take several pictures and when you enlarge them you can see a faint light in the sky. It did not move during the 45 minutes to one hour, we observed it and was still there when we left to come in.  We have not seen that light before today. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a star or Venus??
