golden brown triangle speeds across sky;2003-09-23 23:30:00;5seconds;golden brown triangle speeds across sky we were standing outside work after having a cigarette and talking about looking at mars through a telescope (keep in mind we werent) and then i saw this object moving through the air.it was in a triangle shape and moved across the sky at a very fast speed. there was no jittering motion just smooth like water, no noise no lights, just a reflecting or almost eluminated color of brown a golden brown the hight was from 1500 - 2200 ft above the ground. it went from the west to the east i saw it about in the middle of the sky and it only took a few seconds to race across the sky and disappear.the two other men who saw this with me are co-workers one fell just short of graduating law school and the other just short of an automotive class. all of us good honest people have no clue what it really wwas we saw.we went throught the thought of a bird or plane or weather balloon but then we slowly eliminated those by simple reason. birds honk especially geese plus it never changed shape bird dont even hold together that tight and usually change shape as they fly. plane- no lights at night planes have to fly with lights and its size and shape outruled that idea let alone no noise and how fast it was, and the wind was coming from the east ruling out a weather ballon, i dont think it would fly against the wind at that speed.;46.2836;-96.5623
