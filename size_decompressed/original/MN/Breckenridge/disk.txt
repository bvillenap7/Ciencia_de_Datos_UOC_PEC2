At the time,me at the age of 14,my little sis at the age of 12 and our dad.We left our farm home to buy groceries 40 minutes away and leaving our home out on the country about 10 miles away i was in the front passenger seat of our van listening to my walkman. Remember it was realy dark .No light post or any source of light but the headlights of our van.All of a sudden i see light on our dashboard.At the moment it took me a while to figure out why is there light on our dashboard when there is no light post outside.So I took a glance through the windshield and seen a round craft with lights pointing straight down right above our van realy close hovering over us.Right there and then I scream at my dad while he's driving and told him,look up!.He looked up and stopped the van right away with a look of shock in his face.I got out of the van not fealing any danger ,so my dad got out too.We looked up at this round saucer that resembled a pepperoni pizza but upside! down,but think of it like this.The pepperonies were the lights pointing straight down and this hovering object was realy quiet without making any noise what-so-ever.I could here my sister scream realy,realy loud,I turned to look at her but she was alright.She was only sticking her head out my window looking up and screaming and crying .This object was over us for about 2 minutes and then started to move realy slowly twards a field where we could follow it,there was no road.Only a fenced up field.Another thing ,this thing had a front and back to it .Even though it was round because what was the front had a spotlight going crazy lighting up,down,side-to-side.So this round saucer like I always seen on tv and read in fiction books was moving away from me until it disapeared.Me and my sister still try to remind each other if what we seen was real,but she shuts me up and doesn't want to talk about it.......life,is not the same for me.
