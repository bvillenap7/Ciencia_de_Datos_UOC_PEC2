Thought it was plane but looked too big and too bright for how far away it was. It appeared and then it turned into 2 lights, then the second light faded out and then the first one faded out as well. Then the light appeared again about a minute after and then faded out again. The lights stayed in one spot, disappeared and when it came back it appeared in same spot just sitting there. My husband took out phone and recorded it but it was hard to see on video, because he couldnâ€™t zoom in very well.;45.3376;-92.961
