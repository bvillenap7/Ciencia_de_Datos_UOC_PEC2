Loo;2016-05-24 23:15:00;1 hour;There were 4 things in the sky, couldn't make out the shape.  They were all in the western sky with red and green flashing lights.  Looked police lights in the sky.   Happened tonight at about 1100 to 1130.   They stayed for a long time then very slowly started to move away.   There was absolutely no sound.  Two moved north west and the other two continue west.    After a while of watching them, there was a big white flashing light with a big explosion.   We all watched it happen it was so strange.    After, we went upstairs to bed and our bedroom window faces west and something flashing white flew north east and close to the ground.;45.3376;-92.961
