3 orange orbs over Red Wing, MN;2012-07-28 23:25:00;10 seconds;3 orange orbs over Red Wing, MN I was sitting on my porch chatting with my family, and my brother noticed an orange orb in the sky similar to what he's seen overseas.  He jokingly mentioned ufos. I watched it move west to east moving from tree line to tree line of visibility in a horizontal path.  2 more orbs followed suit after.  There were lightning flashes from a thunderstorm in the general area where they were spotted.  It almost looked like the objects were using the storm to hide, and 1 orb acted as a scout for the other 2 orbs.  They did not have any blinking lights like standard aircraft, or make any noticeable sound.;44.5548;-92.5467
