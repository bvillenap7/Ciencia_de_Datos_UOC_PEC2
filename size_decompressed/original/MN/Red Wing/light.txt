Star-like object over Red Wing, MN;2012-08-07 23:00:00;~1 min;Star-like object over Red Wing, MN Conversating, star gazing, and having a bonfire like we usually do.  A bright star catches my eye. It's beaming white like a bright 8 point star, then it starts to move in a straight horizontal or slightly curved path.  The object had the brightness of multiple stars.  It looked like it was about the altitude of a light aircraft.    We watched it for at least a minute until we lost visual as it crossed over the tree line. The object had no sound, and moved at speeds of a light aircraft.  Roughly 10 minutes later it appeared in the same general area we originally saw it, and disappeared within a second.   It looked like the light blinked or ingulfed.  About an hour later it showed up in a different location, blinked, then you could see an object trailing like a satellite.  We saw it 1 more time blink above us around 1 AM and called it a night.;44.5548;-92.5467
