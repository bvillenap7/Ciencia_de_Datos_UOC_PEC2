Multiple circular rotating lights.;2013-10-27 19:00:00;Hours;Multiple circular rotating lights. Multiple rows of multiple circular lights that rotated around a center point.  Lighting was faint behind clouds in the sky.  The lights would appear about every 5 seconds and last for about 3 seconds.   Someone said that they were just the northern lights, but I have never seen the northern lights appear as rotating circles that appear every 5 seconds.  He said that he has seen these lights before so this isn't the first sighting.;46.8661971428571;-96.7528799999999
