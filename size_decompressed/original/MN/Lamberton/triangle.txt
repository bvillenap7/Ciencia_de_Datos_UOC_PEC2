Fast Moving Triangle Craft - Two Events;2015-11-07 21:15:00;3-5 seconds;Fast Moving Triangle Craft - Two Events At about 9:15 pm on November 7, 2015, I decided to sit in my hot tub.  About an hour later I witnessed a silent black triangle fly over the tree in my backyard continuing over the neighbor's house - it was coming from the northeast and flying to the southeast.   I believe it was between 10:15 and 10:30 pm, I did not look at the time on my phone until 10:44 because I was collecting my thoughts on what I had just witnessed.   The object had flown over in the 11 o'clock position and was about the size of my fingers at arm's length or about 3 1/2 inches.  It was an equilateral triangle, silent, black with pointed  corners, and the two leading edges were glowing.   About 45 minutes later probably between 11:00 and 11:05 pm - (I didn't look at the time until 11:09 pm because once again I was collecting my thoughts.) I saw two of what I assumed were the same object that I saw earlier.  They were flying north to south in a side by side formation.   The two leading edges of both objects were glowing and this is what I was focused on.  I was trying to figure out how many lights there were.  The glow was very, very dim.  There were many points of light on the edge and brightness was not consistent nor was the spacing even.  Having experience working with plasma, it appeared to be more of a plasma glow.   By 11:15 pm I had decided that was enough of that for one night and I was in the house. This would be the first time that I have experienced anything of that nature.  It freaked me out to the point that I slept with the  lights on for about a week.   I had just set up the hot tub towards the end of summer and was spending one to six hours in it per night or about 20 to 30 hours a week.   I had always believed that only a certain type of person saw such things and that most could be explained.   My thoughts are now inclined to believe that of you spend enough time outside - you will eventually see something.;44.2359;-95.2788
Plasma Shower???;2016-03-06 19:00:00;3 hours;Plasma Shower??? I decided to lay in my hot tub at about 7 pm on Sunday, March 6th, 2016. About a half an hour later I noticed out of the corner of my eye to the north what I thought was a wave or ripple in the sky which is very typical when the northern lights are going to put on a show. I got a different show instead. I saw 30 to 40 somethings between 7 pm and 10 pm - it was almost like watching traffic or a decent metor shower. They were triangle shaped to blob shaped.  Most were translucent or perhaps a hazy or streaked white and at arm's length 2 to 4 inches in size. Two I saw very clearly and one was a three points of light triangle.  The other one had several orangeish lights. I have been an avid sky watcher for 15 years and  spent most of the time watching commercial aircraft fly over.  Never seen anything unusal until recently. Is southern Minnesota in a flap right now?;44.2359;-95.2788
2nd Night.;2016-03-07 20:30:00;5 seconds (each);2nd Night I decided to lay in the hot tub the day after the show to see if the show would continue.  I was out from 8:30 pm to 10:30 pm and did see two blobs shoot across the sky.  They were whiteish and the almost looked like blobs of water.  They were very liquid looking.  The fact that I was able to see it a second night and that the activity had decreased makes me think that it was atmospheric phenomena.  Perhaps a static plasma discharge. These are the things in common with each time:   1)  Colder on the day then previous days. 2)  Not a time I would normally be outside - temps were in the 30's. 3)  Active meteor shower or northern lights at the time.;44.2359;-95.2788
Puzzled.;2016-04-11 19:00:00;5 seconds;Puzzled On April 11th, I decided to sit in my hot tub - I was out there sometime between 7 pm and 11 pm - not sure how long or exact times. At around maybe 9 pm I saw a very well defined whiteish triangle shoot across the sky towards the southwest. It was 1 1/2 inches in size at arms length. Still trying to figure out what it is - I actually have fairly good knowledge and experience viewing natural and manmade things.
