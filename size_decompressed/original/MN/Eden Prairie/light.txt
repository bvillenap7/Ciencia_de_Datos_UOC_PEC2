Woke up at 300 am , compelled to go over to window, bright star light approaches windowshade.;1988-06-10 03:00:00;30 Seconds;Woke up at 300 am , compelled to go over to window, bright star light approaches windowshade. I was around 10 years old at the time when this happened.  I am certain it was not a dream.  I woke up at 3 am for no apparent reason.  I was compelled to go over to my window and open the window shades in my bedroom that sits on the second story and faces south east.  When I opened up the window shade I began fixating on a brighter than usual star in the clear night sky.  A moment later the star light began to move at a moderate pace toward my position. I began to get a little anxious as this was happening.  The circular light kept on getting brighter and larger as it approached.  At this point I was beginning to freak out.  The circular light was then about 500 feet from my window and was incredibly bright and large in shape.  My guess is that it was 100 feet wide by 100 feet tall maybe.  The object at this point was about a 20 feet above me in height. What I remember is that it was taking up most of my field of vision.  At this point I slammed the window shade and ran quickly into my parents room to wake them up.  We went back to the window, my dad did I was too afraid and there was nothing there.  Now this sounds like a bad dream, but I know it was real.  I have had bad dreams though they take place in my bed not standing at a window.  My sister too this day remembers this night as well, as the night her brother claimes to have seen a UFO.  I am writing this now because I recently watched a televsion show about the Highland, IL lights that brought me back to my experience.

Six to eight amber lights traveling in the night sky with no noise (silent).;2015-06-19 22:30:00;3 minutes;Six to eight amber lights traveling in the night sky with no noise (silent) Roughly six to eight amber/yellow glowing objects were observed in the sky, traveling from south to north at a fairly rapid rate of speed in a fairly level flight path, similar in speed to nearby aircraft that are taking off or landing from the nearby Flying Cloud airport.    These objects made no noise, were consistent in brightness and not pulsing, were not flying in a pattern around the airport and did not have any other lights (e.g., red or green flashing lights or landing lights typical of aircraft at night).  There were only the amber lights.   They traveled north from our location for a minute or so and then the lights disappeared (appeared to burn out? – they weren’t far enough away to disappear from visibility).   There was one nearby jet that was traveling from south to north that then turned a right base-to-final approach to land at the airport about three miles east of the location.    In checking radar apps on my phone, there were no flights in the area that appeared on Flightradar24.com, or its iphone app, nor was there anything on Flightaware.com.;44.847037735849;-93.4418572327043
Silent, circular light traveled consistently over a portion of the sky, then suddenly disappeared.;2019-11-23 19:30:00;1 seconds;Silent, circular light traveled consistently over a portion of the sky, then suddenly disappeared. Was in Target parking lot around time given (7:30pm) walking away from the building, looked into the sky and saw what appeared to be a circular light travel quickly across a portion of the sky from right to left visible overhead at a quick, consistent pace, then suddenly disappear as if suddenly traveled or transported away, or suddenly turning off a light. It appeared to be the distance lower-traveling planes coming from MSP, but was at least three times, if not many more as fast. Appearance was as if staring at a street lamp from directly below and about 1.5x-5x the size of the diameter of a plane (long way). It made no sound. Companion was not looking at the sky and did not see it/ sense it. Not aware if anyone else might have seen it.;44.847037735849;-93.4418572327043
