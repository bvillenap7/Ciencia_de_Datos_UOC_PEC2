He yelled, &quot  You guys have to see this! It's creepy and I've never seen anything like it!&quot we all ran outside to check it out, and we looked in the sky and their was a formation of reddish orange orbs in the sky. They appeared to be in a formation that looked like a lightning bolt. We saw them moving slightly one direction and appeared to be moving further away. We ran inside to grab cameras and when we came out, they were gone. We hopped on our bikes and biked a couple blocks and spotted a single orb traveling in the opposite direction. We were very disappointed we didn't get it on camera. The orbs were definitely not airplanes and they looked like lights in the sky I had never seen before. They did not flicker, and they were very big!;44.847037735849;-93.4418572327043

13 to 26 lights in two concentric rings. One ring disappeared.;2019-10-04 23:30:00;>20 minutes.;13 to 26 lights in two concentric rings. One ring disappeared. My girlfriend saw a ring of 13 lights while driving on highway 212. She noted there was a second ring but it disappeared.  I have no explanation for this.  I’m familiar commercial and military jets, and this was not that.  I’ve been experiencing bizarre things at my apartment four the past three years.  Strange sensations and pain from seemingly nowhere.  I’m wondering if this is connected.;44.847037735849;-93.4418572327043
