Disk moved across sky, and slowed floating down toward ground.;2005-07-30 00:15:00;10 seconds;Disk moved across sky, and slowed floating down toward ground. I (age 44 M) was riding as a passenger in vehicle heading South on U.S. 94 about 5 miles North of Monticello, Minnesota on Saturday, July 30, 2005 about 12:15 A.M.   My Brother (age 42) was driving.  He noticed what at first appeared to be a large meteror passing by up and in front of the vehicle moving from the South to the North.  He said that it had a tail - I did not notice a tail.   The object appeared to slow down and turn into a bright white disk.  It was floating down - heading toward the ground, going much too slowly to be a meteror.  It was heading down in a straight line, and then disappeared over a hill at least 2 miles away.  We both commented that we had never seen anything like that before.   My Brother is college educated in the real estate business - I have a doctorate degree. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he seemed to be exceptionally rational and objective in his description of the event.  We suspect that he is an unusually capable witness, given his academic and employment background.  PD));45.2919000000001;-93.8048999999999
