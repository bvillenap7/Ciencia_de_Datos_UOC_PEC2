Large, slow-moving, noiseless, pulsing red light moves east to west.;2014-10-05 01:20:00;20 minutes;Large, slow-moving, noiseless, pulsing red light moves east to west At about 1:20 am CDT on October 5th, 2014, I was lying on my bed on my Macbook Pro. The curtains of my north-facing window are open, as is the window. I happened to look up from my Mac and glance out the window, only to see a pulsating red light.  The pulse is almost exactly one per second, rhythmically, like a dimmer being turned all the way up and then all the way off.  The pulsating light was quite a bit larger than a blinking red wing light on a jet, at least three times as large.  As best I can judge the distance, it appeared to be within five to ten miles of my house. The object was moving — slowly and without variance in speed — pretty nearly due west, at maybe a third or a fourth the speed of a low-flying light aircraft. The experience lasted twenty minutes.  The object gradually moved out of sight to the west, never changing course or speed, never altering the rate of pulsation for its light, never changing size or growing dimmer except insofar as distance altered its visibility.   The object made no noise whatsoever, not of jet engines, nor of helicopter blades, nor anything else.;45.2919000000001;-93.8048999999999
