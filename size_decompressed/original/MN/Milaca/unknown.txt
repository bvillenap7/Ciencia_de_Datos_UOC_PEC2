Extremely loud low frequency rocket like rumbling sound traveling east to west in the sky.;2019-04-18 09:00:00;6 minutes;Extremely loud low frequency rocket like rumbling sound traveling east to west in the sky. At 9 a.m. this morning, I heard a rumbling sound that I thought was thunder and it got progressively louder. I then realized that it was not funder but some sort of aircraft traveling in an east-to-west direction. As it got louder and over my location I realized that this was much louder and lower in frequency than the normal jet. I have heard many different Jets even in full afterburner and this was much louder and lower and frequency and sounded more like a very large rocket exhibiting the typical low-frequency pops that are heard with large rockets. the total time that I heard this event was probably 5 to 6 minutes before the sound finally dissipated to the West. the sky was totally overcast so I was not able to visually see what the object was.;45.7775;-93.6452
