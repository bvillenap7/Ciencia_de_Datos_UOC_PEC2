We were sitting on Prior Lake looking at the sky for the brightest star in the sky.  My brother-in-law died earlier this year unexpectedly and we associate that with him.   Our friend then pointed out Orion’s belt.   Just then, as if to say hi, we saw about 5-6 reddish bigger and brighter than stars seemingly come into the atmosphere from the southeast.  It didn’t appear they were in any formation.   There’s really no telling how far away they were from us or each other. They then seemed to flatten out and slow down.  Then another one and about five more spread out by a few seconds.  As the others were coming in, the first few, and eventually all, seemed to stop and disappear towards the east. I have no idea what it was.  I do know it was not a meteorite or a plane.   I’d like to think it was my brother-in-law saying hi in some way.;44.7098000000001;-93.4129
Red orange glow in the sky about 3 times size of a lantern all one color glow;2015-09-14 23:00:00;45-60 seconds;Red orange glow in the sky about 3 times size of a lantern all one color glow. Looked out my bay window to see a bright red orange almost fushia type hue ball of light. It was glowing and way too big to be a lantern and wasn't flickering as you would see a lantern.  It moved at a steady pace from south to north then tailed downward below the tree line as I lost visual.  It also appeared much closer due to the size diameter of the glow.  I don't know what it was but pretty cool to see such a thing in the sky.;44.7098000000001;-93.4129
