A bright  light  that went from moving slowly to extremely fast to stationary and then gone with no sound or acceleration.;2008-12-05 00:00:00;2 min. approx.;A bright  light  that went from moving slowly to extremely fast to stationary and then gone with no sound or acceleration. I was driving home from my girlfriends and it was late.  There were no other cars on the road.  I saw a light that was steady and not blinking.   It was just a plain white light. It looked like a bright star.  It was moving low to the ground and moving slowly.   At first I thought it was a helicopter and just kept watching it because it stuck out in the air over the open fields.  Then it started moving very fast in one direction and then back in the same direction it just came from.  When I say fast I mean very fast.  It did not accellerate it was instantly moving fast. It did this for about half a minute going back and forth in the sky.  Then it stopped moving for a few seconds all together and was stationary in the sky.  Then it started to move slowly around again like when I first spotted the light.  I then proceeded to pull over and tried to get a video of it on my phone.  When I was trying to get any kind of picture resolution on my phone it just shot into space so fast and was gone.   To someone reading this it might seem like a helicopter is actually what I saw looking for something or someone.   But there is no way a helicopter could move the way this light was moving.  I would not pull over to look at a helicopter.   I instantly called my girlfriend and told her what I had just seen and she said I was crazy.  I know that what I saw was a ufo there is nothing manmade that could do what I saw this thing do.  I never believed in ufos until that night and now im a believer.

Strange Minnesota Lights Explanation.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the lights were from a casino.  PD));2015-08-09 22:00:00;1;Strange Minnesota Lights Explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the lights were from a casino.  PD)) This is not a report but an explanation for the Minnesota lights reported on Aug 9th.  If the picture is to the south, it is most definitely lights from the Mystic Lake Casino.  They have a light formation that is on every night.  It is in the shape of a teepee but makes the ring formation on the clouds at night.  Do a google image search for mystic lake casino lights and you will see.  I see this from my home in Prior Lake all the time as the casino is 3 miles away.  Lake Minnetonka is about 15 miles to the north.  If the cloud deck was unusually high that night, the lights would be visible that far north and look exactly like they do in the photos on your sight.
