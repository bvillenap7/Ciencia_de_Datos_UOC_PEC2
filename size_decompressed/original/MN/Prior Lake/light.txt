Two red lights over Prior Lake, MN;2011-12-25 17:30:00;3-4 minutes;Two red lights over Prior Lake, MN On 12\25\11 at approx 17:30 I saw in the northern sky two red lights moving slowly toward me on a diagonal.  The lights were steady.  No flashing or blinking.  The two red lights were side by side. On of the light slowly moved toward the other.  As it did, it slowly faded away.  The other light remained. It continued to move slowly and it gradually faded away.  The two red lights were very small but a roundness could be seen.;44.7098000000001;-93.4129
Stationary, bright light that blinked 3 times and faded out;2020-02-25 05:43:00;5 minutes;Stationary, bright light that blinked 3 times and faded out I was going to work at 5:30 am and noticed an extremely bright light at 223*, 35* up angle from my position.  It was so bright that it captivated me and the object was not moving.  I thought it was a planet and tried to pull up my star app.  Before I could get it up, the light flashed 3 times and faded out.  It was directly right of a star but I was unable to identify with the app .;44.7098000000001;-93.4129
