Drinking coffee before leaving for work, I looked out over the pasture into the woods.  In the pre-dawn sky, many stars shining as it was clear.  I noticed two bright star like orbs of white light which were stationary, perceptably pulsing brighter and in tandem. This was in the northwest sky.   As I watched, they grew in intensity and then simultaneously, disappeared...as in, Poof! no longer there.   I have tried repeating the viewing at the same time in the mornings to see if they were there again, but no luck.   I've no idea how far apart they were in reality, for they did not look close together.;45.5945;-93.0353
