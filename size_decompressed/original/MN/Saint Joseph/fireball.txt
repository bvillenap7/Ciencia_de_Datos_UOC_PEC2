Fireball that changed directions and vanished;2019-04-27 03:00:00;10 seconds;Fireball that changed directions and vanished It was around 3:00 am, and I was on my way home from avengers endgame, after talking with my friend.  I was in between Waite Park, MN, and St Joseph, MN, when I noticed a fireball almost like it was falling towards the earth, (if I have a distant away from me I would say 10-15 miles out and the fire ball was about the size of a quarter from my perspective so it had to be pretty huge and had a tail from my distant about 3 inches long) then out of nowhere the fire ball shot up in the opposite direction and vanished.;45.5646;-94.3364999999999
