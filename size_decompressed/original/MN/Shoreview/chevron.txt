After 10 minutes, they changed direction and disappeared Startling bright objects (well over 50) high in a clear blue sky glided into circles and shapes –seeming to dance and perform.  They appeared to stay even with my walking stride for about 2 blocks.  I stopped to watch for a bit trying to figure out what they were.  They slowly moved in front of me (they always stayed together in a large group) – I passed under a tree and they were gone.  I stopped again and scanned the sky and there was nothing – not one.
