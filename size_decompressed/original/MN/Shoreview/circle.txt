bright light moved erratically across minnesota sky;2008-05-31 01:30:00;10 seconds;bright light moved erratically across minnesota sky I was lying in a field star gazing with a date we were looking for shooting stars and saw a few throughout the night.  In the corner of my eye I saw a light appear, thinking it was a shooting star I turned and looked.  It was in the southern sky on a clear night, I quickly focused my eyes on the light.  Immediately I came to the conclusion that the light wasn’t a shooting star but rather something else.  The light grew brighter for about 3 to 4 seconds, resembling a car light coming closer.  The light was not very large it started about the size of a star and grew brighter.  I asked my date what she thought the growing light could be, she was uncertain but was quick to believe it must be an airplane.  I too thought it might be an airplane because that would be the most logical explanation.  Once the light stopped growing brighter it was motionless for a split second and then began to move from right to left in the sky.  It started on a straight course, which made me think it really was a plane or satellite but then the light began to shuffle up and down.  Moving unlike anything I have seen before.  Immediately when it began moving up and down I told my date it was a UFO.  I asked her, isn’t that a UFO? She was very scarred and reluctant to admit something like that, but once she saw the light move in the way it did she too said it must be unidentified flying object.  It moved across the sky fast, moving oddly for about 4 seconds the light vanished into the sky.  It seemed to disappear from the sky with no trace of it ever being there.

round bright circling orb around tower;2010-09-11 22:30:00;5+ hours;round bright circling orb around tower My family and I were out in the yard playing under our  outside lights and noticed a bright circle of light moving in short bursts getting closer and closer to the tv/radio towers known as the Shoreview towers.  The light was weaving in and out of the cables and finally right next to the tower circling it and then moving out slowly and slightly up and down.   We watched for a couple of hours and then periodically up to about 3:30am.   The light or orb would have moved away further every time we checked.   I went to bed and looked for any evidence of anything that might be of explanation the next morning.   The sky was clear and blue and no sign of anything hanging around the tower or it's cables.   I have never seen anything like what we experienced and felt compelled to share our experience.;45.0822;-93.139
Bright white ball 250 feet above ground surrounded by dense fog. Disappeared after my view was blocked by a tree.;2016-07-08 05:00:00;15 seconds;Bright white ball 250 feet above ground surrounded by dense fog. Disappeared after my view was blocked by a tree. Was driving to work noticed a very bright light about 200-300 feet above ground. It was located in the Shoreview Army Reserve in a dense fog.  The light shot beams through the fog and when my view became blocked by a tree,  I looked again and it was gone.  Later that day, there was an unusual amount of Army activity in the area.;45.0822;-93.139
