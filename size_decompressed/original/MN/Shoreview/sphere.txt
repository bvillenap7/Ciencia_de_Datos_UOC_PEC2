It was about 9:30pm my daughter and I were outside the house westside in the driveway having a smoke and waiting to see the northern lights,On the news they have been reporting the northern lights were going to be seen for the next 2 or 3 days! Then just out of nowhere was this a bright light like a orb traveling to the east going over the top of our home its a rambler so we have good viewing I said look, it was glowing white looked like the glow of a lightbulb it swayed back and forth as it moved toward the east the light was solid and it did not blink at all and there was no kind of engine noise!  It was the size of a dime held out at arms length I walked down to the end of the drive way to watch it more when I reached the end of the driveway it was nowhere to be found except there was a plane come toward the west it (the light) must of seen the plane and took off!
