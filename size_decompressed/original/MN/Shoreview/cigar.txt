Early morning glowing object;2006-07-20 05:35:00;60 seconds;Early morning glowing object I was out smoking on the side step of my house which faces west, the sun was coming up and the sky was blue with partly cloudy grey clouds! Then a light caught my vision coming from the northwestern area it was just above tree level usally where the smaller planes travel! It was going up toward the sky at a angle then leveled off what was strange about it was it was all one color from the front to the rear a golden yellow color the object was kind of cigar shaped, flat on the top and bottom and tappered on the ends. The object flew smoothly across the sky just like floatly with no effort and there was no noise at all it passed thru some clouds you could still see it thru the the grey clouds glowing and still see its shape it kept going toward the southeast then just faded away as it went!;45.0822;-93.139
