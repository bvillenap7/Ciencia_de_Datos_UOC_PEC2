Light burst and beams of light;2012-07-29 04:00:00;3-5 seconds;Light burst and beams of light I saw something at 4am this morning (7/29/2012) that is difficult to describe accurately. I was driving on county road 19 - a very dark rural stretch of road between New Prague and Lonsdale, MN. I can only describe what I witnessed as a huge burst of light, as if an enormous photo flash went off, just behind/over the tree line to my left.  The center of the light burst was obstructed by the tree line, but the edge of the burst  had a pinkish hue to it.  (The burst was quite bright.  I literally said out loud to myself, What was THAT? Then,a moment later, just to the right of the burst and slightly higher than the flash - again- just above the tree line - were two vertical &quotlaser&quot type beams, seeming to emanate vertically from a center point.  The two beams of light were perfectly vertical, and perfectly crisp...like a laser, but fanned out and dissipated slightly at the furthest most points. The flash disappeared almost instantly.  The beams of light appeared immediately following the flash. I was able to look directly at the beams and recognize exactly what I was seeing. I made 2 cell phone calls immediately after, and noted signal issues during my first call.  Also, my car stereo reception became fuzzy at this time.  (This may or may not be related to the event. I was in a rural area...but have not experienced car stereo static on this route before.)   I've researched everything I can find - from northern lights, to sprites and &quotblue lasers..  This was NOT accurately depicted in any astronomical phenomenon I've read about.   I'm still flustered by what I saw.;44.5371;-93.5836
