White &quotstar&quot in sky lasted 15 minutes then disappeared;2019-03-16 05:00:00;15 minutes;White &quotstar&quot in sky lasted 15 minutes then disappeared Went out to have a smoke around 5 am...seen a star I thought was just a star, but there was another bright star in the sky to my right outside my door, finding it odd that a brighter star was up ahead in front of me.  The bright white light in front of me above past the garages did NOT move the whole time I was smoking, and went out again right after to check my mail.  There was NO sound.  Then just now, an hour later I went out to have another smoke, and this time, the star on my right that was dimmer is STILL there, yet the brighter one that was in front of me is TOTALLY gone.  UFO, yes. What was it? I don't know if it was extraterrestrial or our own government, but I know what I just seen.  This would be my 8th UFO sighting in my life.   I am 45 years old.  Dogs were barking in the area, but I thought it was just because of my coughing a few times during my smoke break but they seemed very far away a few blocks.  I didn't think of taking a photo because! it looked like a star at first.;44.5371;-93.5836
