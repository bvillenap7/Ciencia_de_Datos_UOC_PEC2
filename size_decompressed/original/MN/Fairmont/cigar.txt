saw an extremely large cigar shaped ship moving slowly and very close to the ground.;1975-06-30 01:00:00;5 minutes;saw an extremely large cigar shaped ship moving slowly and very close to the ground. I was driving in the country in between Fairmont, MN. and Welcome, Mn. and saw a extremely large cigar or bullet shaped craft extremely low to the ground and what seemed to be moving extremely slow. The next morning it was reported on the radio that the Sheriffs dept. in I think was Lesour, MN. reported a siting about 10 minutes before I did.  I have thought about this for years but never reported it to anyone.  Tonite I watched part of Larry King and thought I would submit this for what it is worth almost 30 years later.
