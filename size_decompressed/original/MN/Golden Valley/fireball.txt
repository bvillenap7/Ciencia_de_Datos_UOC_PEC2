Vivid green fireball;2003-04-22 01:00:00;1-2 seconds;Vivid green fireball I was sitting in our living room when I saw a green fireball shoot through a portion of the sky that is visible through one of the windows in the room.  It was so clear that it almost looked like some sort of firework.  It was visible to me for approximately 1-2 seconds before trees in our yard blocked the view.  I assume that it was a meteor or something similar but figured I should report it in case it corroborates with someone elses report.;45.0081333333333;-93.3608
