All that I could here was trees knocking into into it as it was moving.  I heard it stop crashing into trees for about 30 seconds.  Just after it flew out of the woods and flash a red light for about half of a second. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));45.0081333333333;-93.3608
