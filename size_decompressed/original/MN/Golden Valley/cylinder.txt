UFO sightings in Golden Valley and Robbinsdale;1998-04-09 23:00:00;3 minutes;ufo sightings in Golden Valley and Robbinsdale My two siblings, a friend and I were out and about after a late dinner.  We were driving around looking at our favorite homes in the area, we were driving near Honeywell and saw this cylinder shape looking thing in the air.  We all started to freak out because we thought it was too close for it to be a plane.   We pulled over to look at it, and at the same time a police car also pulled over to see it too.  Once we did, the object was gone and disappeared.  We didn't talk with the policeman at all but he seemed just as confused.  About 15 minutes later, in an area on the other side of town in Robbinsdale near the cusp of North Minneapolis.  We see the same shape again in the sky, not as close as before.  We pull over again and watch it for two minutes when it again disappeared.;45.0081333333333;-93.3608
