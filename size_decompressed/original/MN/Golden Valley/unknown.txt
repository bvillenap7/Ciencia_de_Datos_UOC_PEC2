NOT a sattelite.;2005-05-31 03:30:00;2-3 mins;NOT a sattelite. I was standing outside smoking a cigarette and watching the sky when I noticed what I thought was a sattelite.  Usually when I spot these I like to follow them across the sky, so as I was doing so I noticed it's trajectory wasn't straight.   Just as I was questioning this I raised my arm up to form a straight line of what should have been the trajectory if it were a sattelite.  When I did this I watched it turn about 45 degrees from what should have been it's straight line orbit.   As I took note of this I lowered my arm, and when I was done lowering my arm the object was then gone.  I checked the sky for a few more seconds for cloud cover, but there was none it was perfectly clear.;45.0081333333333;-93.3608
