I was going to make a turn and while I was looking to my left to see if it was clear to make my turn, I noticed what I initially thought was a street light, but quickly discerned that this orb was moving from east to west alongside and parallel with the road I was about to make a right turn onto.  I watched as it came closer to where I was.  It was the same color and almost the same intensity as those orange street lights.  I didn't want to lose it and wanted a better look so I quickly made the turn and had to take an immediate left onto my street.   I pulled over, shut my car off and got out of my car so I could see if there was any breeze like maybe it was a lantern.  No,it wasn't.  It was approximately slightly larger than one of those exercise balls (though it's difficult to determine size and how high it was ).  It seemed to be approximately 50-100 ft in the air.  Noiseless, floating against ! the breeze turned toward the south and then the light went out as soon as it was almost directly above me and I could still see there was some structure but very dark and as it moved away from me I lost track of where it was.  My mind wanted to go to every LOGICAL explanation.  It was NOT ball lightening, swamp gas, drone, I cannot come up with anything that fits.  I should have reported it sooner, but I feel if anyone else saw it I don't want them to feel alone or like they're crazy because we saw it too!
