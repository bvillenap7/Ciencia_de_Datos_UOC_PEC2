Saw hovering lights above farm when i was 16.;1992-10-01 22:00:00;10 minutes;saw hovering lights above farm when i was 16. Object appeared above a barn and looked to be two bright lights at first, I mistook them for a cars headlights.  On a second look the lights were hovering on the left side of the barn that was 100 yards away and the lights were about 50 feet in the air.  I was frightened to look again, until I noticed the lights had moved to the far right of the barn, and were shining through my bedroom window.   At that time, I took a look and watched them just hover for about a minute.  Then the craft went straight up at a high rate of speed and out of view.
