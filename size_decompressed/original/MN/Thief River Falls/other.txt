2 orange orbs over airport;2009-10-10 22:30:00;20;2 orange orbs over airport i was outside taking my dog for her nightly walk after my late shift at work.  we stopped on my deck, and for some reason i had this feeling i should turn around.  when i did, i saw 2 orange orbs in the sky.  it was an overcast sky with a low cloud ceiling.  i was looking south, towards the airport which had its rotating beacon light on at the time.  the orbs seemed to be hovering over the airport,which is a mile from my house.  they where smaller than an airplane, i know because the airplanes usually loop over my neighborhood when they come in to land.  they hovered over the airport, one stead the other seemed to go up and down in a slight zigzag pattern.  after about 20 minutes,  the seemed to disappear into the cloud ceiling.;48.1172;-96.1769
