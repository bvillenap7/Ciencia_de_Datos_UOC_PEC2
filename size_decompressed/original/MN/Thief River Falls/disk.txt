BRASS  UPSIDE  DOWN CUP AND SAUCER. GREEN AND WHITE LIGHTS. ANIMATED OBJECTS MOVING ABOUT.  BUSINESS -LIKE.;1997-12-15 01:00:00;10 seconds;BRASS  UPSIDE  DOWN CUP AND SAUCER. GREEN AND WHITE LIGHTS. ANIMATED OBJECTS MOVING ABOUT.  BUSINESS -LIKE. THIS WAS 1/2 HOUR FROM CANADIAN BORDER.  VISITING DAUGHTER.  WATCHING TV.  GRANDDAUGHTER NOTICED BRIGHT LIGHT.  1:00 a.m.-20 BELOW.  WENT OUT ONTO DECK, SON-IN-LAW IS AIR CONTROLLER, AND AT AIRPORT, SO MY DAUGHTER DECIDED TO GET OUT THE HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPE.  FREEZING COLD, SO OUR HANDS KEPT SHAKING.  ALL THREE OF US TRIED IN VAIN TO GET IT TO FOCUS (COULD NOT GET TRIPOD ASSEMBLED) TOO COLD.WE ALL TOOK TURNS.  SUDDENLY I WAS ABLE TO FOCUS IT FOR PROBABLY TEN SECONDS OR SO, JUST INSTANTLY LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT I SAW.  MY KNEES WERE SHAKING IN DISBELIEF. BRIEFLY, I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE, AN ALL BRASS UPSIDE DOWN CUP AND SAUCER, WITH THE CUP-PART BEING THE TOP OF THIS THING.  ALL OBLONGED-SHAPED WINDOWS, ALL UNIFORM IN SIZE.  A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN SIDE OF OBJECTS (BEINGS) ALL SAME SIZE SCURRYING RAPIDLY IN MOVEMENT. VERY BRIGHT INSIDE.  THEY WERE NOT HUMAN BEINGS.  THE 'UPSIDE DOWN CUP AND SAUCER WAS, WHAT LOOKED LIKE, ALL BRASS, WITH BRIGHT GREEN AND WHITE LIGHTS REVOLVING AROUND IT.  THIS WAS ONLY FOR A BRIEF TEN SECONDS OR SO, SO INSTANTLY IN MY MIND, I KNEW I HAD TO ABSORB AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE.  I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.  MY VERY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THESE OBJECTS ANIMATED SCURRYING AROUND BY THESE CREATURES?...HAD SOMETHING TO ACCOMPLISH.  THEY LOOKED MORE ANIMATED THAN ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN, AND FRANKLY, ANYTHING I WOULD CARE TO SEE AGAIN.  MY KNEES KNOCKED TOGETHER FOR TWO HOURS AFTERWARD.  IT WAS EXTREMELY SHOCKING, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME, IN ABSOLTE AWE OF WHAT I WAS SEEING.  WE COULD NOT HOLD THE TELESCOPIC LENS STILL, SO IT WAS ONLY A BRIEF INTERLUDE, ALSO, IT WAS BITTER COLD.  I KNOW WHAT I SAW, AND I SAW IT.  I AM A MEDICAL TRANSCRIPTIONIST, OF SOUND MIND, MY DAUGHTER IS A SURGICAL NURSE AND OF COURSE, MY GRANDDAUGHTER, A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT.  MY SON-IN-LAW BEING AN AIR  CONTROLLER, ALSO HAS ASTROLOGY AS HIS HOBBY, AS HE, ALSO, HAS REPORTED SIGHTING AT THE TOWER AND RADIOED TO CANADA IF THEY HAVE ANY UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT COMING INTO AIRPORT FOR A LAND, ONLY TO HAVE THEM! SAY, NO ....WE HAVE NONE.  THE TELESCOPE THE THREE OF US WERE STRUGGLING WITH THAT BELOW ZERO BITTER COLD NIGHT, WAS OF THE BEST SOPHISTICATION.  I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO TELL SOMEONE PROFESSIONAL ABOUT THIS, OTHER THAN US THREE.  WE TALK OF IT OFTEN, AND JUST BOUGHT THIS COMPUTER, AND DECIDED TO GIVE THIS A GO.  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY STICKS IN MY MIND IS THE BEAUTY OF THE OUTSIDE OF THIS.  A RICH, HIGHLY POLISHED-LOOKING BRASS.  AMAZING.  I THINK EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON IN THIS WORLD, AND I THINK IT WAS MEANT TO BE BY GOD ABOVE, THAT I SEE THIS.  LIKE I SAID, WHEN WE WENT INSIDE, MY KNEES SHOOK AND MY HANDS TREMBLED FOR A GOOD COUPLE OF HOURS.  IT WAS AMAZING, AND MAGNIFICENT.  I SAID TO MYSELF, HOW GLAD I WAS THAT IT WAS STAYING UP THERE WE WATCHED THIS OBJECT FOR A DOOD HOUR AFTER THAT, COULD NOT GET TELESCOPE TO FOCUS AGAIN, NATURALLY.....THEN, WHEN IT DEPARTED, IT SEEMED THAT THE LIGHTS JUST, SIMPLY, FADED, THEN DIMMEND, THEN NONOTHING.  VERY AWESOME, I HAVE TO ADMIT.  THE LITTLE BEINGS I.E., CREATURES, WHAT EVER THEY WERE/ARE, WERE ALL THE SAME SIZE AND MY INSTANT IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY ARENT'T VERY BIG.  THE WINDOWS WERE MORE OF AN OBLONG SHAPE, AS OPPOSSED TO A PERFECT, CHUNKY-LOOKING SQUARE.  I HOPE I HAVE BEEN OF HELP.  THANK YOU FOR THIS WEB SITE.  I FEEL NOW, I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN WANTED TO TELL SOMEONE, BUT IT REALLY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SUDDENLY SAY TO SOMEONE, OH, BY THE WAY, I SAW THIS OBJECT UP IN THE SKY, ETC..........THEY WOULD BE GOING...HO-HUM....YEAH, RIGHT.  T THANK YOU. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We suspect witness has in mind astronomy, not astrology.  PD));48.1172;-96.1769
