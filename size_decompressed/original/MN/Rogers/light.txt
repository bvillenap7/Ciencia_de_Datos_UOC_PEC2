Star observed moving erratically through the evening sky;2006-09-25 20:40:00;3 minutes;Star observed moving erratically through the evening sky Last night, at approximately 8:35 PM, I went outside to have a cigarette, and I love the night sky, so I was looking up at the stars, and I noticed one star in particular that appeared to be moving rapidly across the sky.  I kept my eye on it as I tried to come up with a rational explanation for what it could be, but the longer I watched it, the more erratic it's movements became.  It would stop, change directions, hover, and it did appear to move at different speeds.  At one point, it disappeared behind a cloud, but it reappeared momentarily.  It was either too small or too far away for me to actually be able to tell what it was, like I said, I thought it was just a star until it started moving.  I did notice what appeared to be an airplane about 3 minutes into the sighting, although it seemed to be traveling in the opposite direction (NNW) and at a lower altitude.  The star was last seen traveling ESE.;45.1715;-93.5814
