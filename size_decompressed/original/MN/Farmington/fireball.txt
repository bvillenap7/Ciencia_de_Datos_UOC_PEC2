Blue and Purple Fireball with noise sighted.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax from student, we believe.

At around 10:00 PM on that Saturday night, I was looking out my window in the night sky searching for the space shuttle Atlantis, when I noticed right where I was staring a bright blue fireball emmiting sparks and a light hissing sound.  Astonished by what I had just witnessed, I jetted downstairs into my living room to explain to my sister what I had seen in full detail.  I excited my sister greatly, so much, that she decided to search for what she thought, were 'shooting stars'.  Now, I personally didn't think that it was  a shooting star, and if it was, it must have been a heck of a bolide.  So I took a shower after that, and when I finished, my sister told me that she saw a purple one.  I am not sure if this is true, since she is young, and has an imagination, but she does not often lie.  This spectacle amazed me to the point in which I'll never forget.
