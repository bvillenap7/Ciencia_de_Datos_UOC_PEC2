Spinning silver object with 3 lights flying slow at around 2500 feet moving north over Farmington.;2012-07-20 02:30:00;15 seconds;Spinning silver object with 3 lights flying slow at around 2500 feet moving north over Farmington. We heard a swishing noise outside our tent.  We looked to the south and saw a circle shape object with three white lights on the bottom of the craft.   The UFO was silver and shinning with a spinning motion.  The UFO was around 2500 feet above the ground and moving to the north at a slow speed.   After the craft left strange lights were flashing in the area.;44.6628;-93.1539
25-40 circular objects moving slowly/hovering at times in Farmington, MN.;2012-08-27 12:00:00;~45 minutes;25-40 circular objects moving slowly/hovering at times in Farmington, Mn I was outside talking to my neighbor, when she pointed to the sky and asked &quotwhat is that?&quot  I look up and didn't see anything right away.   After about 30 seconds I see 25-40 white circles appear in the sky.  We continued talking and watching these objects for about 45 minutes.  They were white moving slowly, almost hovering at times no sound.  It appeared that they were rotating because they were white, then they would all appear metallic and then black and then they would all at the same time disappear and reappear shortly after either in the same spot or all in different location all at together.   After about a 1/2 hour I got smart and had my youngest run in and get my oldest daughter and her boyfriend and their phone and Ipod.  They ran down the street and tryed to take pictures and video but all that showed up were a couple of black dots.  Not anything like we actually saw.;44.6628;-93.1539
