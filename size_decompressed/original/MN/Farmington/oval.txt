I was sitting in my bed trying to get asleep, when I heard this sound that I can’t describe. It was coming from outside my bedroom window I could tell.  I was curious so I sat up and looked out my window. I lived in circle of townhouses at the time and my bedroom window was facing the center.  There was a swampy pond in the middle. Out in the distance I saw past the swamp an oval-shaped yellow-white shape with a yellow outlining.  It was probably ¾ of a mile away from my house.  The sound it emitted was a kind of electronic, hovering sound that was low-pitched.  It stayed there for about three minutes, and then it took off with staggering speed and strange motion to the upper right. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Object was shining a beam of light down the back of the object, moving in a way most reminded me of a hummingbird with it moving in small circular motions, no sounds like a helicopter or any other craft.  Before it dipped behind the cloud the light flared up to be much brighter.;44.6628;-93.1539
