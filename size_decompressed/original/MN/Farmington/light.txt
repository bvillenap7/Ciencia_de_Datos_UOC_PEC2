Strange objects in sky, not aircraft.;2014-07-27 22:00:00;5 minutes;Strange objects in sky, not aircraft. At approximately 10 p.m on July 27th, my partner and I saw a bright orange light move at a rapid speed across the sky heading north.   We watched the light disappear into the sky.   We went back inside for approximately 1 minute before we saw yet another light of the same color and speed perform the exact same movement.   There was no sound at all.   These were not aircraft, we see numerous aircraft as we are close to the airport.   There were no flashing lights, no change of color or shape.;44.6628;-93.1539

I was taking out our puppy to go potty and I looked up in the sky and saw what looked like a star dropping straight down from the sky.  It didn't go sideways like most shooting stars.  Then immediately after seeing that, I saw what looked like a tiny star moving like a snake through the sky.  The color gradually changed from blue to white, blue to white, continuously until it just disappeared after about 20 seconds.  It looked further than any airplane could go, because the light looked smaller than the stars.;44.6628;-93.1539
