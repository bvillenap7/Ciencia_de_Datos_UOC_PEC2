Explanation for 8/24/06 Flash (*please do not post, this is not a report*);2006-08-24 22:00:00;1 second;Explanation for 8/24/06 Flash (*please do not post, this is not a report*) Dear NUFORC,  As I looked into the bright green flash event that illuminated the sky on August 24, 2006, I discovered one possible explanation for the event others that live near me wittnessed as well.  One day, while speaking with my father about the event, he had said he saw the same phenomena.  We talked about it, and past green flash events, and traced it back to an air-fuel making plant located in Rosemount, MN, which emits such flashes at times.   Rosemount is about 5 miles North East of my location, and where me and a friend witnessed the same event as well.   Once also, there was a powerfull explosion that came from the plant around five years ago, which illuminated the entire night sky to the point that it was seen from Eagan, MN, which is an estimated seven miles from the plant.  Now I cannot fully include that this is the cause of the flash, but that is what I am now assuming the cause is.  Thank you  (COURTESY OF MILE DETERMINATION: GOOGLE MAPS);44.6628;-93.1539
Brilliant green flash sighted.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax from student, we believe.  PD));2006-08-24 22:00:00;A split second;Brilliant green flash sighted On a Thursday evening on August 24th, I was laying in bed, observing the late night commute out of my bedroom window (looking at cars at night settles me down before I go to bed).  As I was observing the late night streets (at the time it was about 10:00 pm) i noticed an extremely bright green flash that occupied the entire sky for about a split second, brighter than lightning.   I was slightly horrified and scared by what I had just seen.   I thought it was a mere hallucination, until I told my friend at the bus stop about a week later, and he said that he had seen it as well.   These flashes seem to go on regularly around my area for some strange reason in which I don't know, but no flash was as bright as I had just seen.
