Disc shaped object, silent, with 2 search light beams, floating through airspace in Minnetonka, Winter or 1976.;1976-12-12 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Disc shaped object, silent, with 2 search light beams, floating through airspace in Minnetonka, Winter or 1976. Decades ago, in the middle of Winter, I believe 1975/76… my best friend and I experienced a U.F.O. event. It had to be the weekend as I was at my best friends house late, well after dark. We were watching t.v. and when a commercial came on, we decided to walk to the local Tom Thumb convenience store for snacks. The store was near, less than a block away. We left his house and walked around the side to the back of the house, heading toward Minnehaha Creek, which ran behind his house. The creek was frozen, and we chose to cross the creek over a bridge that was behind one of his neighbors house. It was a clear night, no clouds in the sky. The area back then was not overly developed, so there were only a few street lights scattered about, they did little to impede the view of the stars. The stars were bright against a black sky. As we approached the beginning of the bridge, we noticed a light in the woods to our left, or from the North. Without speaking, we stopped on the top of the tiny bridge, to watch the lights. My first thought was that it might be a snowmobile, though I had never seen a snowmobile in the city, it seemed the only logical explanation. Moments later, as the light moved closer to us, it became apparent that the light(s) were coming from above. As they came out from the trees, we could clearly see 2 distinct light beams, like search lights, beaming down from a source we could not see. The light originated from a source that was just above the tree tops, maybe 25 feet max? The lights moved slowly toward us, about the pace of someone jogging. The light crisscrossed slowly and seemed to be following the creek. I pondered whether it was a helicopter, but it made no sound and should have kicked up loose snow and debris. I wondered if it was a hot air balloon, but I never saw a flame, and it seemed unlikely. When it finally passed over us, we could finally  make out some shape, the object, which appeared to be black, with no reflection, cut a shape out of the sky. It blocked out the stars with a crisp circular shape. Though we could not see any details, the shape was undoubtedly circular, disc shaped. Again I stress, it made no sound. At this point the hair on the back of my neck was standing on end, this was clearly nothing conventional, we watched slack jawed as it continued on in a Southerly direction. We watched it slowly move around another cluster of trees and disappear. We hadn’t spoken a word the whole time, but then we turned toward each other, my friend spoke first. “Buddy, we can’t tell anyone we saw this”. Without further discussion, we went on our way. I knew he was right, no adults were ever going to take us seriously. I never spoke about it again for decades. We went down different paths, I lost track of my friend. But when I was a junior in college, coming back from a bar with my girlfriend, we ran into my old friend and his GF. We exchanged phone numbers and went on our ways. I began to wonder if I remembered the events from so long ago accurately, so I finally called him. Not wishing to taint his memory, I did not tell him what I saw first, instead I just asked him one question, “Do you remember that one night?” He then proceeded to describe the same event, in exactly the same details, with only one exception…  He claims we saw the UFO on our way back from the store, I am convinced it was on our way to the store. I consider this minor. The fact that he described the event in exactly the same details, confirms for me, that it was real and my memory is still clear. I reported this to MUFON, and the other 2 events from 2006/2009. They kept the 1976 report, and  the 2006 report, but deleted the 2009 report. In all 3 events, I was not alone.;44.9114878787879;-93.4885848484848
