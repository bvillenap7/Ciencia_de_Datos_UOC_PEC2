Large bright white light hovering in minnetonka, mn, summer, 1969;1969-08-01 22:00:00;less than one minute;Large bright white light hovering in minnetonka, mn, summer, 1969 late evening I was walking to friends house three doors away to the east.  It was very dark, while walking along I noticed that there were strong shadows from the pine trees growing north east of me.  I looked to see a very large round bright object or light.  It appeared to be stationary and hovering in the air no more than 300 meters away.  I know it was close becuase it was positioned between myself and a new water tower under construction across a small valley from my location.  It was on a heading to the north east of me at less than a 30 degree angle up.  There was no noise at all but it was very oviously not any noral aircraft due to lack of noise and closeness to the ground no more than 100 ft or so.  I ran to get my friend about whose house was fifty yards away but lost sight of object when I went to door.  WHen we came back out it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

White light moves west to east, suddenly stops, then moves south at a high rate of speed.;1987-10-11 21:30:00;30 seconds;White light moves west to east, suddenly stops, then moves south at a high rate of speed. I was attending a conference in Minneapolis, MN, and staying with a friend near Lake Minnetonka.  I had just returned to the residence with another conference attendee. It was probably between 2230 and 2300, and the skies were clear. I had my arms on top of the car and was thinking about what I needed to bring inside for the night when I noticed a bright white light reflecting off of my arms, the car, my friend’s back and the bushes in a 10-20 foot circle around the car.  The light was flashing, like a very rapid strobe light, and seemed to be directly above us. As I looked up, the flashing had stopped.  I saw a very bright light moving from our position to the east at a very high rate of speed. In just a second or two it seemed to be over the city of Minneapolis.  It stopped very suddenly, stayed in place for a second or two, then sped off at what appeared to be a right angle, now heading south at a high rate of speed toward the Minnesota-Iowa border.  The light disappeared as I tracked it southward. I had yelled to my friend to look up.  By the time she looked up, the light had disappeared, though later she said she did see a very bright flash of light in her peripheral vision as she was getting some things out of the car. Five to ten seconds after the first light disappeared, we both saw two other lights that moved more like meteors.  One was bright orange and appeared to arc from east to west.  After this one faded out, I looked slightly to the north and spotted a second whiter light arcing from west to east. Both of these lights left trails. Comparing our observations, it was clear that these second lights impressed both of us as being consistent with meteors.  The first light – with its brilliance, its burst of strobe-like flashing, lack of a trail, and its extreme speed, deceleration and sharp change of direction – was definitely something of a different nature. I am presently a psychoanalytic-psychotherapist in private practice.  Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S., and had training in fire investigation.  Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.  I consider myself to be a curious, careful, and scientifically oriented observer.;44.9114878787879;-93.4885848484848
Bright star-like light is seen staying in one spot, then quickly moves when witnesses try to investigate further.;2005-11-07 22:10:00;5 min.;Bright star-like light is seen staying in one spot, then quickly moves when witnesses try to investigate further. The object in the sky looked very much like a large star, and was first seen from a window within the house.   I looked out of the window, and saw a bright light.  Although it did look like a star, it was far to large, and was pulsating.   It stayed in one spot for quite some time, but as soon as two of the witnesses went outside, it began moving off very quickly in a southeast direction.;44.9114878787879;-93.4885848484848
Bright light moving rapidly across night sky, leaving a trail, but slower than a meteor and it didn't burn out.;2014-02-22 22:17:00;6-7 seconds;Bright light moving rapidly across night sky, leaving a trail, but slower than a meteor and it didn't burn out. A bright white light appeared in the sky traveling rapidly from SW to NE.  For a second I thought it was a meteor, but it was not moving as fast (but much faster than an airplane) and it kept going until I couldn't see it over the hill.  It didn't burn out like a typical shooting star.  It did have a tail, however, so it clearly wasn't a plane.  I couldn't hear any sound. I am not a scientist, but I'm not a nut, either.  I've never seen anything like this before.;44.9114878787879;-93.4885848484848
Stationary Light became extremely bright and unfamiliar before fading and disappearing.;2014-09-27 04:00:00;30 minutes;Stationary Light became extremely bright and unfamiliar before fading and disappearing. Noticed a star or a plane that seemed unusually bright and twinkling (was actually more of a flashing at times). Thought this was odd, looked at few other stars in the sky, they were all significantly less bright and unremarkably twinkly.  This woke me up more and and i watched the object in question for 20-30 more minutes hoping it would go back to looking like the rest of the stars or start moving like a plane or a satellite.  No change in the objects location occurred during this time but the light grew much stronger and seemed to sparkle like brilliant white light from far away refracting through a crystal.  Thought i saw distinction between blue and red light so i continued to watch the object hoping, again, it would display behavior like an airplane or something familiar.  At one point the light became so brilliant i was positive this was not like any star i have ever seen.  The twinkling/flickering seemed to fluctuate at a constant  rate, like something mechanical. To give you an idea, if the brightest stars and lights from nearby jets in the sky amounted to a pea, this object's light at its brightest moment would comparable be that of an apple. Light faded and is now gone from the spot in the sky, even when no visible cloud cover is overhead. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
