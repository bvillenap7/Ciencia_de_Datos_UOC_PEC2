Shiny spherical object in broad daylight.;2014-07-04 06:22:00;5 minutes;Shiny spherical object in broad daylight Today while my dad and brother were playing catch they noticed a small spherical object shining in the blue sky.  They called me outside and its funny because I was watching the X-Files at the time and I went outside to see what the fuss was about and i look up in the sky and there was a bright shiny object.  I watched it for a couple seconds then ran inside to get my camera to take some pictures of it.  I dont know how to upload pictures on here but i have them if someone wants to see them.   Anyways I took a couple pictures of them and then watched the object for about 2-3 minutes and the object seemed to move for a couple seconds then stop and then start to move again and so on.  So then looked down at my camera for about 5 seconds to turn it off and I looked up and the object was gone.  Im not jumping to any conclusions about it being an alien but it was definitely a UFO.  I looked up if it was possible to see satellites in daylight but a lot of the websites and! results all said that iridium flares are possible but very uncommon. also the object was a sphere and it was not long like the iridium flares.  Maybe it was some sort of drone or military surveillance aircraft but i do not know.;44.9114878787879;-93.4885848484848
Slow moving very large sphere-like object which appeared to be enveloped.  ((NUFORC Note:  Out-gassing event of spent rocket.  PD));2015-06-22 22:40:00;4 minutes;Perfectly clear night stars in full view.   Slow moving very large sphere-like object which appeared to be enveloped in a white opaque cloud, moving in a steady line from the south-south east to the north-North west.   There was faint aurora boriealis and it appears the steady moving object which kept its straight and steady movement was attempting to be disguising itself in the faint natural light show.   No sound, no blinking lights, just a soft whitish glow that appeared to be enveloped in a cloud moving at the speed of a giant low flying jet at a very slow speed.  About the size of a full moon against the stars.   Watched it for approximately 4 minutes until it faded into the distant North to northwest sky.  THIS WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE.  My first thought was, Someone else must be seeing this right now...  It felt like it was aware that I was watching it. ((NUFORC Note:  Out-gassing event of spent rocket.  PD)) ((BEGIN COPIED NOTE FROM MR. TED MOLCZAN)) Hello Peter, Your hunch probably is correct. The Sentinel 2A satellite was launched on a Vega rocket from the Guiana Space Center, last night at 9:52 PM EDT (Jun 23 01:52 UTC). Coverage of the launch was here: http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/06/22/vv05-mission-status-center/ SeeSat-L received several reports of sightings near 23:49 EDT (3:49 UTC), of what appears to have been exhaust from the final burn of the Vega rocket's AVUM liquid fueled upper stage. That burn lowered the perigee to ensure that the object decays from orbit within a reasonable time, in order to curb the growth of space debris. http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0193.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0194.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0195.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0198.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0199.html Marco Langbroek blogged his analysis: http://sattrackcam.blogspot.nl/2015/06/aurora-hunter-images-last-moments-of.html Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
