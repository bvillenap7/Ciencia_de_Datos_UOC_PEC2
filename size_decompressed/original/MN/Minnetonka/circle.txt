Circular object stops then flys;2015-04-10 21:15:00;10 minutes;Circular object stops then flys Me and my friends were out spotting satellites and star gazing and all the sudden we saw a bright orange object that we assumed was a satellite.  We watched it and it was moving super slow then it would stop for a couple of seconds and then resume flying and it would repeat that.  After watching it for a couple of minutes we knew it wasnt a satellite. It also changed directions twice.  We tracked it for 10 minutes until it flew out of sight.;44.9114878787879;-93.4885848484848

She had just left my house in Richfield, and was on her way to her home in Minnetonka.  She was heading west on Hwy 62 as she approached her turn at 494 she looked out her window and saw a circular set of lights, 8 to 10 in the group in the sky to the south.  She described them as being above the lake by the International School.  Which would be about 3 city blocks from her location she was to afraid to try taking a picture.  I believe out of all previous witnesses my daughter was the 1st to witness and the closest to the lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected advertising lights at a local casino.

Bright orange ball of light on the Eastern horizon that moved unnaturally;2018-08-11 07:00:00;1-2 minutes;Bright orange ball of light on the Eastern horizon that moved unnaturally 8/11/2018 7 a.m. I was driving east on Cedar Lake Road between Cty. Rd. 73 and Hwy. 169.  The Sun was this gorgeous orange ball low on the horizon. Then it started to move. I realized at that point that the sky was heavily overcast there were thousands of feet of clouds between me and the real Sun.  Whatever this thing was it was lower than the clouds. I can't say how big it was large enough for me to mistake it for the Sun for a moment.  It didn't move aerodynamically it bounced around on the south side of the road before crossing over and quickly descending behind the trees on the north side.  It was in view for 1-2 minutes. It didn't change size, shape, or color.  It was featureless just a perfect circle of bright orange.  I checked the local papers and the Internet, but haven't seen any reports from anyone who might have seen it. I have no idea what it was.  It didn't have the ephemeral feeling of reflected light it seemed very solid.  It did nothing that frightened me it just wasn't supposed to be there.;44.9114878787879;-93.4885848484848
