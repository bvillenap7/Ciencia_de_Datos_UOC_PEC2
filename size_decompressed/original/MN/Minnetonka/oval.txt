Huge oval with balls of light on sides, did not move got photos.;2015-08-09 22:30:00;10 minutes;Huge oval with balls of light on sides, did not move, got photos. It was about 10:30 at night.  My co-worker and I were walking home from work together since we’re neighbors.    As we were about to enter our neighborhood, I commented on how a cloud looked like a smoke ring.  Upon closer inspection, this thing was definitely not a cloud.  It was a large oval-like object that had balls of light on the sides of it.   I took out my phone to take a picture or video or this thing.  I was about to open the camera on my iPhone when all of a sudden it died.  Note that it was at 12% battery and that this shouldn’t happen.   However, my co-worker/friend was able to snap a few photos.   Another odd thing I’d like to point out is that the object would not show up in a Snapchat picture, nor would it show up in a video.   After about 10 minutes, we decided to head home, since this thing wasn’t moving and it was getting late.   I would like to note however that it seemed to be higher up before we moved out of its sight. ((NUFORC Note:  This report, in error, was first posted for a date of August 10th, 2015.

Saw an oval of lights in the clouds at night with breaks in between.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights at local casino.  PD));2019-08-31 22:44:00;~30 minutes;we saw an oval of lights in the clouds at night with breaks in between so it wasn’t a solid oval. it was 10:44 pm when my friend and i saw the lights. we were parked on a side part of the road where excelsior blvd and saint albany’s bay rd intersect at (44.9066, -93.5380). it overlooks a highway and it has a good, clear view of the sky. we saw the lights in the sky and thought it looked weird. we couldn’t see any objects because it was kind of cloudy where the lights were so you could only see the lights through the clouds. my friend thought the lights were from the high school football field lights so we drove there (about 5 mins away from where we were parked) but it wasn’t. the lights were a white color and were in the form of an oval from where we were but i feel like it would look like a circle if we were directly under it. the lights in the shape were not a solid oval, there were breaks in between the lights.  the oval also looked like it was a pretty big size too. we couldn’t really see it move considering we were moving most of the time in the car to try to find possible answers. we only saw one but it could have been 10-ish small objects in the form of an oval. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses were observing the advertising lights being projected on the bottoms of clouds by a local casino.  PD));44.9114878787879;-93.4885848484848
