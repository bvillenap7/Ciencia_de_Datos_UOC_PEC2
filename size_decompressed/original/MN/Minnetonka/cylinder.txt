Noticed double layered lights surrounding a massive circular object in the sky around 494 and Minnetonka Blvd.;2019-08-22 04:00:00;15 seconds;Noticed double layered lights surrounding a massive circular object in the sky around 494 and Minnetonka Blvd. I was driving to work early in the morning and noticed double-layered lights surrounding a massive circular object in the sky around 494 and Minnetonka Blvd.   At first, I thought it was just street lights or a special billboard. However, I kept staring at it and could longer explain what it actually was.  I just knew that there was not supposed to be any bright lights in that particular area of the sky.   I parked my car in the parking lot and got out with my camera phone.  But the UFO was already gone.  This was the closest that I have ever seen one.
