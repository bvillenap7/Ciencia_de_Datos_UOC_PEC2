Fireworks and then flying objects with lights;2008-07-04 22:30:00;15 minutes;Fireworks and then flying objects with lights We went to Excelsior MN to watch fire works and had a great view sitting on the beach.  The fire works had ended and we started to gather our belongings, when someone said look and they were pointing to the sky. In the sky you could see objects that where flying south to north with four lights on each object.  The lights appeared to be moving on the object in a circular motion.  The color of lights would vary from Red, Blue, Green and White, but on each object the color of the light would always stay the same. If it was Red it would remain red.  I believe there were about 30 objects that went past us. They just kept coming and coming.  The objects would fly close together and in groups then just disappear.  I canâ€™t believe planes can fly that close together and that many flying at a time.  It was the strangest sighting I have ever seen.  I grabbed my sister-in-law.  It freaked us out. We had a group of 14 people on the beach with us, but there where a lot of people around us, remember the fire works had just ended.  Our group contained people from 45 to 2 years old, and even my 5 year old talks about this event. I truly wish someone had a video camera to video this.   I tried to take a picture but it turned out black.;44.9007;-93.5772999999999
