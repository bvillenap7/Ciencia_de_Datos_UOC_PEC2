Formation of 10 to 12 square shaped objects observed over Excelsior, MN;2008-07-04 22:35:00;5 Minutes;Formation of 10 to 12 square shaped objects observed over Excelsior, MN July 4, 2008 10:35 Central Time   Large formation of square objects observed over Excelsior, MN, moving from southern horizon to the north straight overhead.  Objects had four white lights on each corner which gave the appearance that they were square shaped.  Objects seemed to be very high in altitude, perhaps in Earths orbit.  Some were in pairs or groups of 3 and 4 and would rapidly change position in their formation.  Objects disappeared when they got directly overhead. Altogether, there were approximately 10 to 12 objects total.  This event happened at 2235 local time and lasted about 5 minutes.  This was after the July 4 fireworks show on the lake.  There were thousands of people out there.  We were on a boat and there were many witnesses.  The fact that the objects were changing positions in their formation proves to me that they were not satellites.  And they were not aircraft as I know them. I am an airline pilot and amateur astronomer and feel that I know what is not normal in the sky.  I have seen many strange things at night in the sky but have always been able to find an explanation.  Not this time! ((NUFORC Note:  Please see illustration by witness on NUFORC homepage.  We spoke with this witness, and we were left with the impression that he is an exceptional witness, and quite credible.  PD));44.9007;-93.5772999999999
