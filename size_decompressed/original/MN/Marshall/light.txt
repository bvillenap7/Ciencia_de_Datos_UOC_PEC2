Green, orb-like UFO spotted outside Marshall, MN.;2010-02-20 22:00:00;6-10 seconds;Green, orb-like UFO spotted outside Marshall, MN. My fiancee and I were just leaving her mother's house near Marshall, MN, to go fill the car with gas before heading for home.  Within 5 minutes drive from Marshall we both suddenly noticed a bright, green light or orb in the sky, slightly above and in front of us. It appeared to be stationary and wasn't very big but within seconds it seemed to grow as if getting closer and/or brighter. We were both in awe, as this was not by any means normal. It was about 1.5 to 2 times the size and brightness of the moon that night. Not 2 seconds after it appeared to move closer, it took off. The large, green orb displayed streaks of orange light as it moved from the top corner of the driver-side of the windshield up into the sky and completely out of sight in the blink of an eye, with the movement resembling an upward swoop. The whole experience lasted about 6-15 seconds or so but I have never, ever seen anything like that in my life.  I am convinced that it was not of this! world, simply because it was so bright, moved with such speed, and even more so the way it moved. A hook-shape if you will, where, when it was stationary, it was resting at the end or barb of the hook and once moving, quickly swooped down then back up and was gone. That about sums it up though. Hope you enjoy the report. I definitely enjoyed observing it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.4490999999999;-95.7847999999998
