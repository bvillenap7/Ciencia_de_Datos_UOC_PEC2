I first thought it was the V formation of a flock of birds.  I cupped my ear to listen, but it made absolutely no sound.  It glided smoothly but quickly from the North towards a South-southeasterly direction.  It spanned the portion of sky from Hercules to Capricornus (where I lost it behind the trees) in about 5 seconds.  It was shaped like a flattened out V. At arms length it was about 3 across and about 1 long.  It's shape was made up of many pinpoints of white lights, not brilliant, about as bright as the average star.  It was a perfectly clear night, the moon had not risen yet.  I was outside just gazing at how spectacular the milky way looked when I saw it. My background: 37 year old male, I own a hardware store, I have a college degree in marketing and management, I am an avid starwatcher, I own a telescope, I do not believe in extraterrestrial life but I am miffed by what I just saw.;44.4490999999999;-95.7847999999998
