Bright, fast moving star heading east over Birch Lake RV Park in Babbitt, MN.;2011-06-24 23:00:00;10 minutes;Bright, fast moving star heading east over Birch Lake RV Park in Babbitt, MN. Around 11pm on June 24th, we were all sitting around a campfire when I looked up and saw a very bright star moving east very fast.  I have been camping for 30 years and have always looked up in the night sky and have seen satellites go by, but never this fast or this bright.  Everyone else I was with said it was a satellite, but I wasn't convinced.  Where there any satellites over Babbitt, MN, on this night, or did I witness something else?  I witnessed a large fireball object in an open field about five years ago, while we were stopped waiting for a train to pass, so now I'm on the look out for such things constantly.
