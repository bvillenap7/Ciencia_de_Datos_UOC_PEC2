Shiny white flat cylinder shape object over Shakopee, MN.;2013-07-24 12:45:00;30 seconds;Shiny white flat cylinder shape object over Shakopee, MN. I was driving on HWY 13 West bound when I saw in the distance a flat, long, cylinder shaped object (cigar shaped).   I didn't think much of it at first, it was moving quickly through mid-cloud range, so I thought it was a plane.  I checked on it a couple of times because I was driving and I'm good at looking around in my surroundings, but  the object stopped.  A dead stop you could see it sit still with the blue sky behind it.   It sort of startled me knowing that planes don't stop like that.  Then after about 8 seconds at dead stop, it vanished. Here is a full description: shiny, bright, white in color, long, flat-cylinder shaped (cigar), moving at a quick pace for about 22 seconds through mid-cloud range, dead stop from out of the clouds (blue sky background), vanished after 8 seconds.;44.7818;-93.5165
