Circle of lights in Minnesota is Mystic Lake casino.;2015-08-09 22:30:00;60 minutes;Circle of lights in Minnesota is Mystic Lake casino The circle of lights seen in the SW suburbs of Minneapolis/St. Paul is from the Mystic Lake casino south of Shakopee, Minnesota. Google Image searches will show the teepee' formation of spotlights outside this American Indian establishment.  The beams cross each other and then disappear from view, but if cloud conditions are just right you'll see a spot above each beam (yet the beam itself doesn't have a searchlight appearance).  As clouds drift and change density, the lights appear and disappear.  It's an eerie effect, and you wouldn't believe it's originating from the ground unless you see its source on the casino grounds.

Smaller circles form bigger circle over Shakopee. I was able to get a clear picture.;2017-11-04 00:00:00;1 hour+;Smaller circles form bigger circle over Shakopee. I was able to get a clear picture. Around midnight I noticed these lights in the sky above the casino in Shakopee at Canterbury Park.  About an hour later, the lights had moved ever so slowly to where they were at 1 am when I left to drive back to Illinois.  I took several photos and the lights appear to be in a circular pattern similar to what was reported in Sepetember.  There were no casino advertisements at all being displayed.;44.7818;-93.5165
