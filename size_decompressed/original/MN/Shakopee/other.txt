On November 7th 2004 my friend and I had just returned from Mystic Lake Casino. I was walking my friend to his car which was parked at our garage located in the back of our home. Crossing the back yard I had happend to look to the southern part of the sky. That night the Northern Lights were visible in the sky. As I looked to the South part of the sky, I noticed 2 bright red lights flickering in the distance. They seemed to be only a few blocks away, could have been miles, but they seemed close. I pointed it out to my friend, and we watched it for a while. He said it was a plane, but I said it's moving way to slow, maybe it's a helicopter. But there were no other lights on it. Just two red lights that would blink or flash one after the other. My friend told me to stop talking about it, because he had to drive 40 miles alone back to his home. I don't know what it was, but it was awesome.;44.7818;-93.5165
Driving S on a major hwy. in the city a red/orange large bell shaped object seemed to float thousands of feet.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-12 01:05:00;5 minutes;Driving south on a major highway in the city a red/orange large bell shaped object seemed to float thousands of feet above a local event venue.  Was not a ballon, as it was far larger than practical for any event.   The moon was behind the witness ruling that out as well.  Far to large to be any other known celestial body or man made object.   After 5 minutes, the object disappeared behind what appeared to be clouds.
