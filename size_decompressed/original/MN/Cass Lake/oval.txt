Disappeared quickly after spotting but have photo. I was taking a photo of some pelicans flyer over the west side of Leech Lake but saw this object flying at high speed (faster then any plan I've ever seen) and altitude from west to east.  It was white and oval shaped.   The sky was nearly cloudless but it disappeared behind a cloud.  We waited for it to come out the other side but it didn't, it was gone.  I have a photo that the ufo can be seen in.;47.3486;-94.6143
