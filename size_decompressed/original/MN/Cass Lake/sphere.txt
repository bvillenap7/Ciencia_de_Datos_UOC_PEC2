I was standing on my porch smoking a cigerette looking south and  gazed in the southwestern sky and seen a more than average star like object in the low south to west sky and i watched it and all of a sudden it went from there to a upward straight line to the southeast and stayed there then just slowly faded away in the night.;47.3486;-94.6143
