BRIGHT light  low in the sky- middle of the day.;2006-11-21 12:25:00;3 minutes;BRIGHT light  low in the sky- middle of the day. Driving mid-day, saw a BRIGHT light a couple of miles to the south - like a reflection from a plane.  But usually a reflection would last only a second or 2 while the plane moves or while car is moving.  This thing looked as though it was a helicopter or small plane- only because it was so low- like right above the little town of St. Boni.   A couple minutes later, when I drove into town, this light/ object was WAY off the horizon- into the high clouds. -like farther away than any of the other jet liners in the sky.  As far as the eye can see. Yet, still bright. Remind you:I could see this light the entire 3 minutes of driving into this town.  I couldnt take my eyes off it. I guess becaues it looked like a big something that was not moving- and so close to the ground.  It looked like a bright star.  Or like I said before, the reflection of a jet liner.  I could not see any object, only light.   I generally do not believe in ufo's...  But I have been brainstorming on what light this was, and how did it move so far away, so fast. I have no explaination.;44.9066;-93.7479
