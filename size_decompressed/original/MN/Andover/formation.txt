I was outside in hottub at around 8:40 PM central time on the night of 3-18-12.  It was very clear and a nice starry night.  I had seen a plane (jet) just 30 seconds before flying from E to W very high over the Twin Cities at cruising altitude (like a NY to Seattle flight or something like that.)  Then, flying roughly SE to NW at a higher altitude, I saw two dots, offset from one another-not side by side, like that of a plane, but, farther apart and nothing visible in between them.  They were brownish color, much higher and much, much faster.  That is why I say about 10 seconds because the plane I mentioned previously took probably 30-40 seconds to fly across my vision in the sky.  This thing took about 10 seconds.  It was definitely an object or one thing OR two things flying synchronized-which would be more my guess.;45.2377;-93.2765
