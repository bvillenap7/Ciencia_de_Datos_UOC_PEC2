Brilliant green craft observed near Anoka county rd 9 in Andover, MN., 1145pm 06/02/06 two witnesses;2006-06-02 23:45:00;10 seconds;Brilliant green craft observed near Anoka county rd 9 in Andover, MN., 1145pm 06/02/06 two witnesses I saw a brilliantly lit green craft flying just over the tree tops as I was driving to my relatives home just before midnight. I could tell the craft was moving in the same direction I was. I saw small lights of reddish orange in what appeared to be the back of the craft. It was about the size of a large home. I have never seen any craft that ever loked as unique or as impressive as this one. I looked at the craft for only about 10 seconds due to my driving at night. The craft quickly disappeared. When I arrived home, my brother in law discribed seeing the same green craft coming out of the sky and hovering behind trees about 5-8 minutes before I saw the craft. He mentioned that while he was driving, another car in front of him must have seen the craft also because they put on their brakes and slowed down. He thought it was going to crash on or near the road due to it's descending angle towards the ground.;45.2377;-93.2765
