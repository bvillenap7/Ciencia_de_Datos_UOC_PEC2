While stretching and looking to the sky I had noticed a bright oval shaped light sitting in the sky. At first I didn’t think anything of it until I started to notice there were no other flashing lights on the object and it did not appear to be moving. I took my iPhone 11pro out of my pocket and began to record the object and began to zoom into it. The object had to have been at least 5-10 miles away from me. The closer my camera got I noticed that there was light moving around this object and there is a noticeable circle inside of it. I have it all captured on film. Amongst one of the videos I was taking the object disappeared from the sky as some sort of other object shot past it leaving a trail of light of purple and blue. When the object had passed the oval shaped light had reappeared in the same spot.;43.6722;-92.9742999999999
