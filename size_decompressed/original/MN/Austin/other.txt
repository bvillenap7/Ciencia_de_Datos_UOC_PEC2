brilliant multicolored cloudshaped entity (a pulsing cloud of beaming color);1974-06-15 13:00:00;2hrs;brilliant multicolored cloudshaped entity (a pulsing cloud of beaming color) In the summer, many years ago, I was traveling with three other friends and noticed 2 very unusual clouds. It was about the year I graduated, 74,75 We moved west to get a better look and eventually came to park almost directly beneath one. The clouds where about 2 miles apart. The other quit a bit west yet. They moved very slowly to the south and stopped. They were amazing. The only thing I’ve ever seen like them is the northern lights. The center was one color then another band of color towards the edge or circumfrance and an occasional third band of color would come and go. The clouds “pulsed” just like the northern lights from the center with thin sharp protrusions somewhat like a spinyfish or sea urchin. They were more flat and plate like than high and fluffy I quess they were about an eight to a quarter mile in diameter. They resembled the spin art pictures people often do at county fairs. Yet very sharp and defined. We got out of the car and laid on the ground for over an hour. We finally became board and went on our way. I have seen some amazing northern light over my 50 years. Many colors, many shapes and sizes. One night the whole sky from horizon to horizon and moving rapidly in waves. Breathtaking.! The police talkied about it all night on the radio. That was in the early 1980’s. But these clouds were in the middle of the day. I think about 1pm or 2pm Very vivid and full like a single rain cloud but pulsing from the center and with very vivid colors. Deep clear color. I don’t recall any normal clouds in the sky at all. Its been years and I really don’t remember all the details. I have never seen them since, nor have I ever heard of anyone else seeing them besides the people with me. I may still be able to contact two of the others that were with me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));43.6722;-92.9742999999999

I drove off the road cause i couldnt see in front of me whe i came to a stop the object was still there.i cant say what it looked like because it was so bright i couldnt look directly at it it was dead silent didnt make a sound nor did it move i would say it stayed there for a good half ho ur or so then it shot straight up  anyways im sure it did because if it took off at an angle i would have gotten a good look at it;43.6722;-92.9742999999999
