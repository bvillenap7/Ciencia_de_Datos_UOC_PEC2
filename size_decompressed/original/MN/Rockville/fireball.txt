Five bright orange orbs central MN.;2019-09-27 20:10:00;3:17;Five bright orange orbs central MN While traveling north on Hwy 23 four miles south of interstate 94 I observed a line of bright orange orbs traveling from NNW to SSE approximately 1000-1500 ft AGL.  The first two were grouped close and just after passing nearly straight above me, shot up through the cloud deck at high rate.  Three more followed in the same line but instead of going up like the other two continued SSE to the horizon.  The last one went dim before reaching the horizon.  I immediately pulled over and videotaped them as soon as I could safely do so.;45.4743;-94.3408
