It was a clear and calm evening and it was about 11 pm and me and my buddy were outside on his back balcony and we noticed multi colored lights in the distance and shortly after we seen 3 flying discs flying in a v formation heading west I noticed there were three different colored lights, blue, red and green all around the edges of the ufo’s they were moving about two mph and the crafts were spinning counter clock wise they were literally  20 feet away from us they made a whirling sound. When me and my buddy made eye contact we seen a quick flash of light so bright that it was blinding and in a blink of an eye the crafts were gone.
