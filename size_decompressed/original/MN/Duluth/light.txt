A large bright orb that changed size N.E. of Duluth Air National Guard.;2002-10-01 23:00:00;60 seconds;A large bright orb that changed size N.E. of Duluth Air National Guard 1/11/2016 	 	This is the first time I have told my story to any form of public media.   In the fall of 2002, (I do not remember the the actual day, exact time, or month) I brought our german shepherd pup Greta outside to do her business.  It was approximately 10 or 11 o'clock in the evening and the night sky was clear.  We went out to the front yard and as I usually do, I look up at the stars, always in awe.  I remember thinking to myself God who or what are we when I noticed a large bright white star in the northeast over my house.  I always gaze up at the Milky Way so I kind of know how it looks everytime.  I asked myself is this the North Star or maybe a planet I have'nt noticed before?  	At that point I looked down to ((dog's name deleted)) and gave her the command hurry up so she would do what she needed to do.  I looked back up at the object and after a couple seconds it shrunk down in size and moved right or up and disappeared.  I was and still am in shock.  I still cannot believe what I saw but I know I did see it.  If you held your thumb and forefinger 1 inch apart and held it up to the night sky, then you would have the distance this thing traveled before it vanished.  This was large enough that I thought it may have been a planet, but after it reduced in size it looked like any other small, very distant star. 	I immediately went in when ((dog's name deleted)) was finished and told my wife and our 2 boys.  They just smiled and thought it was pretty amazing.  Now I do not know if there is a connection or not but both ((dog's name deleted)) and myself became ill over the next few months.  She started scratching all the time so much that she was losing large patches of fur.  The vet treated her for mange but was unsuccessful.  Even though the blood test did not show any mange he gave her an amount of medicine he normally would give a horse because she did'nt respond to the normal antibiotic dose.  That didn't work either so he made an appointment for her to see a pet skin specialist that came up from the Twin Cities.  We never made that appointment because Greta was killed on the highway just days before she was to see the doctor.  This was in February of 2003. 	Concurrently with ((dog's name deleted)) suffering with her condition I started scratching a spot on my left arm.  It was a small white spot that itched terribly and I had to scratch it extremely hard to even make it bleed meaning it seemed like that little white spot was very tough, hard to dig out with my fingernail.  Well I went to the doctor who of course did'nt know what it was, and she burned it out by freezeing it.  Things got worse because I was feeling an aching of sorts deep in my upper spine area.  At the time I was driving long-haul big rigs and it became harder and harder to go back out every Sunday.  By July of that year I was totally disabled and could not work anymore.  That doctor put me on Lortabs for pain but did not know what was wrong.  The lortabs were not working and that doctor failed me not knowing what to do so I sought out a doctor who specialised in pain control.  His diagnosis was Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome.  I underwent many tests, seen numerous specialist! s and took many different painkillers and other medications.  The only thing that kept me alive and still true today are the opioids. 	In the last couple years my neck has been curving downward and that led to an appointment to see a rhuematologist.  He looked me over and said I have psoriatic spondylitis.  Wow.  It seems my neck bones are fusing together.  I now take Enbrel shots weekly at home but that is about 60-70% effective so I still need the narcotics because I am so stiff and hurts too much when I move around.  I have no clue if Greta's and my disease was a result of the light in the sky, but I don't know what that thing was and the timing of everything does make me suspicious.  I just wish I had a video camera at the time because I've never heard anyone describe any light orb that behaved the way that one did. 	I bought a video camera asap after that experience and incredibly, I seen another light orb in 2012.  Unfortunately, I never became proficient with it and the video is shaky, zooming in and out.  At one point I had to pull out and focus at the moon and then reacquire the orb, which I did, before it moved slowly and disappeared like the other one.  I have placed the clip on Youtube.  I now have a better camera so I hope to do better if I ever see another UFO. 	Finally, I would like to point out that neither of the objects made any noise or had flashing lights.  And I find it interesting that we live about 5 miles from an international airport and a Air National Gaurd base and I heard no guard jets take flight on those evenings.   Thanks for reading.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
Bright, white light moving towards east faded into red-orange color and disappeared.;2007-08-15 22:20:00;30 seconds;Bright, white light moving towards east faded into red-orange color and disappeared. I was walking my dog and looked up into the clear night sky.  I saw what looked to be a bright planet at first - A bright, white light.  I then realized that the light was slowly moving to the east at a steady, slow pace.  While still fairly high in the sky, the light dimmed, turned red-orange and then disappeared.  No other aircraft or lights were visible in the area.  The whole sighting lasted about 20-30 seonds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Bright pulsating light over lake superior.;2007-10-10 22:00:00;10 minutes;Bright pulsating light over lake superior. Location of sighting was on the hillside of East Duluth overlooking lake superior towards the southeast. My roomate was having a cigarette out on the porch when he noticed an unusually bright star in the sky above the lake. He came and got me and i grabbed a pair of binoculars. To the naked eye, it appeared to be flashing. upon closer inspection through the binoculars, i could see that the light was flashing/pulsating different colors. It had a uniform sperical shape to it. at this point we were making various conclusions as to what it was. my other roomate dylan seemed convinced that it was a plane, but i was not so sure. it did not seem to be moving. the object remained stationary for some time (5 min) as we watched. It became brighter and slowly began moving to the right (Southwest), and proceeded to move behind a small patch of trees which were blocking our vision. the object emerged from behind the trees and was moving noticibly faster and it seemed closer. the object proceeded towards the right and began ascending upward at which point it went up into the overcast. although we did observe the object from a distance, somewhere between 4-5 miles, i am quite convinced that this object was not a helicopter or plane. i was so startled by what i had seen that I went online to try to figure out what to do, who to report it too, etc... that i how i stumbled upon your website. thank you for giving people the opportunity to go somewhere with these sightings. more attention needs to be paid to the subject of UFOs because what i saw was definitley unlike anything i have ever seen in the sky.

A brilliant white light traveling over Lake Superior north to northeast.;2008-07-18 22:20:00;5 minutes;A brilliant white light traveling over Lake Superior north to northeast. I was lying on my couch watching a TV program when a light caught my eye, through our picture window.  A very bright and constant light, like a white-hot ball, slowly moved through the night skies.  It made its way north, from over lake Superior, and slowly arced northeast in direction.  At one point, it seemed to slow a bit and then gradually and effortlessly gained speed.  There was no sound and I made notice of the object to another person walking by.  The person thought it must be just a plane, but there were no normal signs of it being any kind of plane, helicopter, or ultra-light vehicle... such as wing tip lights of green or red, no under belly light, no tail light and no sound.  This was not a plane. I have known “man-made” aircraft/planes since I was a child.  My family was a member of EAA and we went to the EAA Fly-in in Oshkosh, WI every summer for 18years.  Also, my father built and owned an ultra-light aircraft.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078

3 bright orange  lights equidistant from each other moving north over Duluth;2012-07-04 22:15:00;1-2 minutes;3 bright orange  lights equidistant from each other moving north over Duluth I was walking home with my dog around 10:15 pm on 4 July 2012 when I saw a bright orange light moving north over Duluth. F irst thought it was a plane as it was in the flight path of incoming planes but maybe a little lower.  Then I observed 2 more identical orange lights each equidistant from each other and following the first.  There was no sound.  When I reached the corner about 40 feet away to see where they had gone they had disappeared.  The next night I saw the late night incoming plane.  It had a white/yellow headlight (like a star) and a small flashing red light, nothing like the orange object.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078

Then I noticed it was moving from left to right, but then it went down (I guess you could say south) which immediately I thought was incredibly odd, because I've seen satellites and they just don't move like that. I then noticed 3 other lights around it, which were not as bright, but moving all over in all directions around the brighter one. I ran inside to grab my co-worker (who absolutely does not believe in UFOs by the way) to show her and I said to her &quotyou need to see this and tell me I'm not crazy!&quot She walked outside and looked up and watched for about ten seconds, then ran back inside and said she couldn't watch because it was freaking her out- I stayed outside and she kept yelling at me to come inside but I couldn't stop staring up at these crazy moving light! s for about ten minutes. Our shift was then over and she said &quothurry up let's get out of here, stop looking up!&quot We left work together but they were still in the sky when we made our way from work... I am definitely freaked out by whatever it is we saw.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
Multiple groups of 30-40 lights signaling with flashes and moving in sync.;2013-08-10 22:00:00;4.5 hours;Multiple groups of 30-40 lights signaling with flashes and moving in sync. I was laying out by the fire at my family's cabin, to watch the climax of the meteor shower.  As I lay there for about an hour, I saw some good meteors and five satellites orbiting the earth.   I then saw what looked like a satellite and it stopped. It then proceeded West, then East.  I got excited and went to grab my wife.  Could not see much movement when we went back out, so she went inside.  After that I witnessed groups of three to seven lights, signal each other across the span of my view and then two would do a kind of stand off synchronized movement with very fast back and forth and swirling movements.  They would turn off their lights and move to different areas in the sky.  They would also align themselves in a three light line and other constellation shapes.   It was still going on when I went to sleep.   Could not get it on film, though I tried.   Definitive evidence for me that advanced life exists!!!!;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
White light moving over Duluth, MN then vanished.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS.  PD));2013-10-18 19:40:00;20-30 seconds;White light moving over Duluth, MN then vanished. I let the family dog outside to do his call of nature.  When I looked up at the night sky I noticed a speck of white light (a little larger than a star) moving across the north horizon in a straight line in a north to northeast direction (towards Lake Superior) at a slow speed. 	I observed this for about 20 to 30 seconds while trying to discern if it was the space station or a plane with its landing lights on.  I also noticed the full moon was rising to the east/southeast and it seemed to make the light/object brighter (Reflecting the moonlight?). No other visible lights were observed on or around this object. 	At this time I ran inside to get my brother so he could try to help verify what I was looking at.  It took no fewer than 10 seconds to inform him and for me to return outside and the object was gone.  What it was I don’t know and I have no clue as to how it quickly disappeared?  At the speed and direction it was headed, how bright it was and how high on the horizon it was traveling, my brother and I should have been able see it again. 	It should be noted there are three airports in the direction I was looking at: the Duluth International Airport, the small airport on the waterfront of the Duluth/Superior harbor and the Superior, WI, airport.   I did not check with the tower logs of the airports and don’t know if it is possible to check with them.

Red light appearing/disappearing and then moving into 3 different locations and disappearing.;2013-11-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;Red light appearing/ disseapering and then moving into 3 different locations and disspearing My boyfriend and I were taking a walk in Bagley nature center (part of UMD campus)and we stopped to observe our surroundings as we began talking about the universe. Coincidentally, as we were looking in the sky I saw what I thought was a shooting star. Immediately after,   A red light appeared that I thought maybe was already there and didn't notice.   However, the light disappeared after 10 seconds and reappeared after about 5 seconds.  It did this about 3 times before my boyfriend decided to pull out his phone to take a video.   As soon as he was looking for his phone, I saw the red light move from one spot, to another, then another in the shape of a triangle and then disappeared for good. Unfortunately, none of it was caught on camera like planned. I think it stopped for that reason alone.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
Large ufo appearance of a star in Duluth, Minnesota.;2019-09-25 22:00:00;10 minutes;Large ufo appearance of a star in Duluth, Minnesota. A friend and I were sitting outside looking over Lake Superior, when we had noticed what looked like a giant star in the sky.  At the time, it wasn’t moving, but we knew that there was no way it was a star because it was way too large and it was hovering over Lake Superior.  It had lit up the lake as the moon does sometimes here.   We ran into our house to grab 3 other friends to come see it cause we had no idea what it could be.  As soon as all of us were out there looking at it again, it took off instantly.  It moved in high speed and as we got to the top of stairs outside (3 stories high).  As close as it was to us it was completely silent.  It slowed down and slowly dropped down into the trees.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
5 Large Yellow/Orange Lights in formation and 1 separate, between 100-500' above ground in Duluth MN;2019-12-10 19:15:00;50 seconds;5 Large Yellow/Orange Lights in formation and 1 separate, between 100-500' above ground in Duluth MN we were driving up Lester River Rd at approx. 1915 hrs, this evening, 12-10-19.  I was a passenger in my sons car, and my fiance was following us home.  We'd just crossed the Strand crossroad when my son and i saw what looked like 5 or 6 triangular shaped yellowish-orange lights up in the sky ahead, slight right, at about 200-500 AGL.  I'm a pilot and I know these were NOT airplanes.  As soon as we noticed these lights which one could not have missed, my fiance flashed his high-beams at us so I KNEW he'd seen them as well. I saw what appeared to be one unit out ahead of the others, with a space between them and then what can only be described as a SEQUENCE of these identical lights light up one after the other.  They also appeared to be hovering.  these objects were angled at a slight angle which to me seemed like a nose up pitch in the section that had the 5 triangular shaped lights.  the tree tops got in the way and then, they were just gone.  My son saw something similar last night where Lester River rd t's into Roberg Rd in Lakewood. Just fields there.  Here is the coordinance of these UFOs 46.913296 by 91.975568. If you'd like to speak with us during your show feel free to call us.  I called 911 as soon as i got into my driveway, explained what we saw, and dispatch told me someone would call me back shortly.  about 3 minutes passed and local Sheriff called me back.  I was telling him what we saw and two military jets flew directly over our house heading towards the area we reported, a minute later, a third jet.  I still don't know what to make of this.  BUT IT WAS NO PLANE.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
