In the early morning on a winter day when I was younger, my friends and I had a sleep over, and one of my friends had a paper route, so we were out probally at 4:00 A.M. and this triangular object was suddenly noticed above us. It was very hard to distinguish the border around the object, even though it was very low, and large. There were lights on each corner, or what looked to be the corners. and it was a bigger light like the color of the moon, and there was another light within the light that moved in a circle inside the big light. The friend with the paper route was the only one that didn't see it. becasue he was doing his route, but the other five of us saw it, and were very traumatized... and immediately ran back to the house.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
Aurora type of craft seen;2001-03-05 21:30:00;5 min;Aurora type of craft seen This is a bit late in reporting, but two men told me about a siting, that I am relaying to you. March 5, 2001, Duluth, Minnesota. 9:30 to 10 p.m. A large triangular craft, reported to be about 4 times the size of a stealth jet was seen while two men were driving north on Hwy. 53, thru the  northern suburb of Hermantown, Minn., next to Duluth. It was dark, but the color seemed to be a greyish, silvery color with a light on each corner and one in the center.  The two men were traveling in a car, watching it. It had crossed the highway from the leftside, moving to the right. It was moving very slowly, almost hanging over the highway for a while.   One of the men thought that it should be moving faster and be out of site when compared to commercial planes.  It was fairly low in the sky, a little higher than treetop level, he thought about a block high.  They pulled the car over to the side and stopped to listen. There was no sound coming from it.  It continued drifting slowly until it went past a bunch of trees and then it suddenly either took off extremely fast or just disappeared.   It was angling in the direction of the Duluth Air Force Base which has been officially closed for quite some time. (Although there is some activity, I think Air National Guard stuff happening there. There have been some fighter jet activity around there, since the Sept. ll attack.) The craft was triangluar shaped, except in the back it wasn't a straight line , like a true trianglar, but was indented some.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
((HOAX??))  black triangle, three white lights on bottom, 1 pilot human, windy sound, slow, near woods or airport, see in craft,;2009-02-08 10:00:00;3 minutes;black triangle, three white lights on bottom, 1 pilot human, windy sound, slow, near woods or airport, see in craft, Me and my friend were on our way to the bar by his mom's house to hang out and catch up. We were driving down a paved road traveling toward the airport in my town. I think it was a little after 10 PM because it was dark out. As I was driving West I had to make a right. If I had turned left, this would have led me right to the front of the airport. As we took a right we traveled down another road going in a north east direction. On the right of my car was the city, the other left side was woods. As I was driving I look up,over, and to the left. Just above the tree line 30 feet feet from the road was a triangle black object. This had three lights on the bottom. When I seen this I was like Oh my god dude a UFO! my friend looked up and cursed from disbelief. I pulled the car over on the shoulder and shut it off, we both got out. The object was stationary in the air and made only a faint windy sound. I observed a regular light that was on in the cockpit. There was a guy with a helmet on reading a book or manual of some kind. (It looked to me like he was trying to figure something out about the craft)  It was driven by a human for sure, but the craft was strange. Also there is a fighter pilot station at the airport less than three blocks from where we seen this object. The craft was kind of small to, it moved as slow as a helicopter and flew out of our sight slowly. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a hoaxed report here.  PD));46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
Fast moving triangular shaped object.;2010-10-29 00:00:00;1.5 seconds;Fast moving triangular shaped object. I was standing on the second story deck of my home having a cigarette.  I looked left and was shocked to see a Very large looking Triangle shaped craft.  It had about five or six very bright white lights around it's front. It was silent and moved rather quickly.  It was gone behind some houses after about 1-2 seconds.  I ran outside to try to see it but did not witness it again.   I listened for the sound of a plane just in case that is what I saw and there was no sound.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
Triangle of lights observing us through our window above the tree line, and would move side to side and closer and away.;2012-05-28 23:30:00;90 minutes;Triangle of lights observing us through our window above the tree line, and would move side to side and closer and away. One Triangle shape objected, one big light on the front, white light, and various lights on the sides and back of shape. Light was shining in our bedroom window moving along tree line and then as we got up to watch the object it moved through the trees, it would get closer and then pull back when we were in the window watching or made a sound.  The sighting went on for about 90 minutes and then it went away.  It would move sideways left to right, hovering in the air about 30 to 35 feet. It was a cloudy night, we had rain earlier.  Object was about 100 feet away from our house, but moved closer and then pulled back behind trees.  We live our in the country, rural Duluth, Minnesota.

Three dots of light arranged in a triangular pattern were hovering silently for around ten minutes before moving away.((anonymous));2020-04-18 23:13:00;~10 minutes;Three dots of light arranged in a triangular pattern were hovering silently for around ten minutes before moving away. I was letting my dog inside.  It has been partly cloudy today, so there were no stars, but I saw three lights in the formation of a triangle, probably hovering around 6,000ft, and completely silent.  I unfortunately do not have a mobile phone or a camera to photograph it with.  It hovered silently for 10 minutes before the lights flew away.  For the sake of my credibility, I am an elderly gentleman, but I have clear vision and no health or drinking problems.  I have been with the Catholic church since I was a boy and I would never lie about something like this. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume an evening sighting, and have changed the time above.
