V-shaped lights over W. Duluth harbor/bay front.;2019-05-05 21:00:00;10 minutes;V Shaped lights over W. Duluth harbor/bay front. Over the Lake Superior Bay/I35 corridor in West Duluth I observed two rows of lights--Red and green alternating in a boomerang shape.  I live on the 13th floor so the lights appeared very close to me.  It appeared to be ONE object as they all moved at the same time within the same space.  It moved a short distance, --Probably a few hundred yards-- Very quickly, and then back in a split second.  I watched until I was bored with it.  When I returned to the window several Minutes later, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
