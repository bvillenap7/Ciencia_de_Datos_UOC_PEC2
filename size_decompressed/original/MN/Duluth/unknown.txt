Light over Duluth, Mn. - similar to the Phoenix Lights of 1997;2012-08-11 04:00:00;1 hour or more;Light over Duluth, Mn. - similar to the &quotPhoenix Lights of 1997 At approximately 4:00 am I was about 7 miles North of Duluth, Mn on Northshore Drive heading South. As I looked towards Duluth, Mn I saw a string of lights lined up East to West.  They were unevenly spaced, blinking white, and lined up perfectly.  They covered about 60 degrees of my viewing width at an upward angle of about 25 to 30 degrees. They were moving very very slowly Northward up the shore line.  At first, they seemed to be over Duluth and I thought they might be our antennae towers, but the distance I was from Duluth did not make sense because the angle of viewing was too steep from my location. There was another more faint string of lights directly overhead and lined up South to North. They were moving Northward much faster. Picture the speed of a high altitude jet moving....   then double or triple that for the speed I am talking about. I was working a delivery route and noticed as daylight came, they were gone.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
