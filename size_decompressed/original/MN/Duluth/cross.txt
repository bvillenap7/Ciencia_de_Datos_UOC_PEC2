Translucent and silent unidentified aircraft.;2020-02-24 20:30:00;2 minutes;Translucent and silent unidentified aircraft. At 8:30 pm in Lakeside, Duluth, around Lester park elementary school a buddy and I were driving and saw 2 lights hovering about 20 feet above the trees.  when we got underneath the craft I had my head out the window and I looked up at it and it was translucent almost,  I could hardly make out a shape and it was probably 50 feet above me only.  The Craft was probably a little bigger than the truck we were in but smaller than an airplane from what I could tell.  It hovered for probably a minute than it took off into the sky.  The craft made no noise at all which was also very odd.  And last, the movements it was making was not like any aircraft I have ever seen.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
