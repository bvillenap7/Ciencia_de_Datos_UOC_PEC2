An oval that had a green glow and blinking light.;2007-10-26 04:30:00;30 min.;An oval that had a green glow and blinking light. It was an oval object that had a green glow, with a blinking light on top, and looked like it was spinning. It stayed in the same spot in the sky for about 15 min., and then it raised its elevation and moved to the south and stopped again. An airplane on the left flew by it, heading east. I could hear aircraft heading in that direction when I went to bed.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
A minor amber color trail, (from where we were) extremely slow movement, and an odd amber coloration like the Phoenix Lights.;2009-07-12 21:30:00;Total? Maybe around 10 mi;A minor amber color trail, (from where we were) extremely slow movement, and an odd amber coloration like the Phoenix Lights. Well. After just hearing about the Phoenix Lights on March 13th 1997, my father and myself recall sitting outside one clear summer night in 2009 maybe around 9:30 (Your ZULU time or Military time confuses me a little bit, so might as well be sure on this.)  We saw only one oval shaped Amber colored... object, in lack of a better word, about 4-5 miles west of where we were.  It had sat in one spot for a minute or two, then we noticed it was slowly moving around, and from where we were sitting it was almost not even noticeable.  Then, it disappeared for about two minutes, slowly fading into the night sky.  All of a sudden it slowly reappears, and does literally the same exact movement we saw.  It was almost like a deja vu moment.  After a few more minutes it had disappeared again, and that was the last we saw of it. Oddly enough  (This really doesn't matter, but my father and I had found it rather amusing since what we had seen prior to walking into the house.) the! film Contact was on our television.  I hope you do not find this report a fake or a joke, due to it being as real as anything we have seen or felt or even heard today.  If you want to do an interview my email is here: ((e-address deleted))  If you decide to read this, I do hope to hear back from someone, maybe someone from Minnesota, preferably in town, but oh well if not.  Thank you for taking this time to read this. - ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  There is not much that could be gained by conducting an interview, we feel, approximately three years after the incident.  PD));46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078

White light above the trees  at the end of Park Point in Duluth, MN;2017-06-28 03:30:00;20 minutes;White light above the trees  at the end of Park Point in Duluth, MN Early on the morning of June 28, 2017, I was awake at 3:30 a.m. and looking out my window from a townhouse on Barkerâ€™s Island in Superior, WI.  My view looks across the water to the area in Duluth, MN, known as Park Point.  I saw a bright shining object hovering in the sky some distance over the tree tops.  It was just past the pump house beyond the small airport that is at the end of the point.  It did not move in the sky as a plane or helicopter would do.  I checked my Night Sky App to see if it was a satellite or planet, and found that there were none in that area of the sky.  It was too big to be a distant star.  The object had flickering white lights and stayed very stationary in its position for about 20 minutes, then it disappeared.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
