Bright blue-green ball with trailing light tail;2010-07-25 02:35:00;15 seconds;Bright blue-green ball with trailing light tail Last night at about 2:35 AM while driving north on Trinity road by Lake Superior College, my wife, son and I witnessed a very large very bright blue-green glow with a streak or tail of light behind it drop from the sky almost straight down at an extremely hi speed. It appeared as if the glow stopped before reaching the ground. My guess is it was a meteorite, but I would really like to know for sure what exactly it was that we saw, and if anyone else saw the same thing.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
Seeing two flaming orbs in the sky;2012-07-04 22:00:00;1/2 hour;Seeing two flaming orbs in the sky Right before the fourth of July fireworks there was two aircraft in the sky that looked like they they were fire orbs.  I have an extreme history in experimental and civilian aircraft and have been to Oshkosh airshow many times  (The biggest airshow in the world) and know 100% that this was NOT a man made aircraft.  No aircraft are MADE to look like they are on fire or are on fire.   After online research I realized this may be some kind of UFO,  It's like they were just around to see our fireworks!  To me if this is aliens it makes sense, they just wanted to watch like we do, but it's weird since we live so close to a military base that nothing was scrambled to see what it was that night unless they knew what it was, in that case, the GOV is up to some weird stuff, but if they come to my apartment after this I'll hopefully let you know!;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078

Saw 8 very bright orange orbs flying in formation and disappearing.;2015-01-09 17:30:00;20 minutes;Saw 8 very bright orange orbs flying in formation and disappearing. Me and my dad were driving to grand Marais to do a job.  It was about 5:30pm when we saw the see bright glowing orange orbs in the sky.  I saw them first and mentioned it, and then they just disappeared. My dad thought it was just towers, and I argued with him.  About 2 min later he saw them again, then they disappeared again.   He started freaking out then we saw 2 more over the lake, so we pulled over to look, then they were gone.   Then we saw 2 more across the street opposite of the lake.  Then back over the lake we saw 4 of them flying in formation then it looked like 1 shot out of the other kinda like a missile, then they disappeared.   These orbs were over Lake Superior, along the north shore.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
3 separate, consecutive sightings heading NE, N of yellow circular lights gliding at continuous speed across the night sky;2020-08-16 21:15:00;15-20 minutes;3 separate, consecutive sightings heading NE, N of yellow circular lights gliding at continuous speed across the night sky 9:15pm  Saw a bright light gliding across the sky, much too low to be a satellite, going northeast direction.  After viewing an actual satellite go by, another bright light glided by, except this one I noticed traveled below the clouds.  I compared their size to a glowfly normally seen from a few feet away.  No blinking, constant continuous yellow light (like warm stars) and gliding motion and speed, moving in the same direction.  Then another one went by, this one more towards the north, less east, prompting me to come in to see what these could be.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
