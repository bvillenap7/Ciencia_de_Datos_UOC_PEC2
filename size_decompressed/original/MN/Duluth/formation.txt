Unexplained lights over Lake Superior;2000-08-23 18:30:00;5 min.;Unexplained lights over Lake Superior I was sitting waiting for a friend in front of my window which has an excellent expansive view of Lake Superior and the Duluth harbor.  I noticed clusters of four bright lights in seven groupings flying from northwest to southeast over the lake and harbor. At first I thought they may be seagulls reflecting the light from the setting sun off of their bodies or wings but the lights stayed constant and never varied in distance or intensity from one to the other.  I further believe I would not have been able to see them at all if the light had not been just right. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

White solid larger light light followed by 8 solid red lit lights in a perfect V formation mostly - no sound.;2008-08-30 04:40:00;60 seconds;White solid larger light light followed by 8 solid red lit lights in a perfect V formation mostly - no sound. What looked like stars moving from NW to SE across the sky one large bright white light lit solid followed by 8 red lights in a perfect V formation, lit solid in color, except for the 7th on the right side of a perfect V shape moving irregularily in and out of formation abruptly up and down, and when doing so, would turn solid white light in color when out of formation.  From that distance it had to have been many miles of movement rapidly.  I have images on my cell phone video camera.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078

4 lights over Duluth, MN, one a blue-green with possible gassing, 3 yellow lights following.;2015-01-10 07:03:00;2-3 minutes;4 lights over Duluth. MN, one a blue-green with possible gassing, 3 yellow lights following At approximately 7:03 A.M. on the morning of 1/10/15, I went out to pick up my newspaper.  In the Northern sky (North of my vantage point), I noticed a light moving from West to East.  It was bluish to green in color.  The strange thing was that it had 3 plumes coming out of it.  One plume was directly behind it and two others were coming almost straight out the sides.  It was very bright and easily noticeable.  Following behind the first were three more.  They were single lights, almost as bright, but smaller and yellow colored.  There were no plumes on these lights.  All 4 lights were following a same flight pattern, but far enough apart that there is no way it could have been a single aircraft.  The first (plumed), third and fourth lights were in a direct line.  The second light was higher in altitude.   I waited for 5 more minutes after they disappeared into the horizon to listen for possible delayed jet engine noise and there wasnâ€™t any noise whatsoever.   Whatever this! was there is no doubt that all 4 lights were flying in unison on the same flight pattern all the way across the sky.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
Light formation with large disk at center;2019-07-01 23:00:00;2 minutes;Light formation with large disk at center I was on the north shore of Lake Superior later in the evening and over the lake came a formation of lights that at first appeared to be a very long/wide aircraft with two bright yellow lights and smaller green and orange lights on either side.  It came in close very fast and had no sound at all.  It appeared to stop and hover and a few smaller individual lights came shooting off and quickly faded and disappeared into the distance.  All of this with absolutely no sound.  The larger object then seemed to just get farther away as the lights eventually faded completely.  It was hard to tell if the object was going up or away or turned away in a certain  direction.  The entire event lasted only a couple of minutes.  What I remember most was the fact it was absolutely silent and seemed to hover very gracefully while the small lights shot out very quick and graceful as well.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
