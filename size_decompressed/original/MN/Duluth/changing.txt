I looked to my south and saw a cluster of lights in the tree tops. I asked my friend what it was and he said he thought it was a boat untill he realised it was at the tree tops. after a few moments it thinned out into a stright horizontal line across where the skyline would be. The lights looked like airplane landing lights that were 2-3 miles away. there were approx. 15-25 lights and they did not get any closer or farther away when they went from a cluster to a line. i then went inside to wake up my girlfriend. i was inside about 2-3 minutes and came back outside and no longer saw anything.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
