As I walked outside at 19:20, I noticed two objects above Duluth in the south sky, unmoving.  Both had four flashing lights on them in a square-shape.  They only stayed about a minute after I noticed them, and began to move toward Superior, WI.  They made no noise as a helicopter would when they left.
