12-15 globes of light hovering above the northern hillside.;2012-06-23 22:00:00;20 minutes;12-15 globes of light hovering above the northern hillside. Upon walking out the front door of my home (with my daughter and wife, to send my wife off to work) which faces north, I identified that, about a mile away and above the wooded hilltop, there were 12-15 globes of light slowly changing colors from reddish orange to light orange, hovering above the hill moving slowly in no specific pattern. They were hovering and slowly moving vertically and horizontally. During the initial 5 minutes of my observation, the 3 lights that were closer to the hilltop seemed to flash a bluish bolt of light down beneath them onto the hilltop. This flash of bluish light seemed to happen instantaneously and looked to be focused beneath them and onto the hilltop itself. This happened several times from the closest orbs (there were about 3 of them that were close to the hilltop, the rest were above them, hovering and moving around in the sky and the globes of light emitting the bluish flashes of light seemed to finish the intermittent b! luish flashing  in the span of about 5-10 minutes. These objects began to fade into the clouds two and three at a time.  The whole process took about 20 minutes until all the lights were no longer visible.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
Large golden sphere of light moving across the sky.;2020-04-18 22:00:00;3 minutes;Large golden sphere of light moving across the sky. Saw a large golden sphere of light above the tree line towards the large towers in Duluth. Moved after we saw it and dropped down to where we could only see it in between the houses across the street and then it disappeared.;46.8101737876;-92.1816019030078
