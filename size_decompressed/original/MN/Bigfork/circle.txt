Red glowing object.;2017-09-02 21:00:00;3 minutes;Outdoor grilling with neighbor, when he spotted red glowing object in the sky.  Altitude of object was approx. what you'd expect from a small plane, but there was no noise from it nor the blinking light[s].  I can only guess its distance because we couldn't be sure of its scale.   It moved from south to north at a steady but slow pace....  We had trees near us that obscured it partially, but actually had time to try [unsuccessfully] to get our wives to come out and view this.  We had been out on our pontoon less than an hour earlier on probably the calmest evening I can ever remember so thinking this was a burning ember being blown about by the wind wouldn't have made sense.;47.7504;-93.6702
