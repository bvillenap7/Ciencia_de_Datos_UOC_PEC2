Large triange shape craft with many lights on bottom.;2007-06-15 23:00:00;5 seconds;Large triange shape craft with many lights on bottom. We were driving down a back road to our cabin when we first saw yellow lights go by us from the back side of our truck, over trees and out of sight.While looking out the window to try to see what we saw a nother one flew by in front of us, and from no where a huge craft triangle shape flew directly over us.  It was solid in shape, it made no sound and had many lights on the bottom of it.  Blue and white lights.  It was very large, bigger then a house. It flew just over tree tops and seemed to move with such glide. It could not be seen after going over the tree's. We kept driving for maybe 20 seconds to reach a opening of the trees.  When we reached a opening over a small lake they were gone. We had a good view of the sky now and there was nothing. they left as fast as they appeared. Neighbors said they were probable stelth aircrafts, I'm not convinced.  But maybe.  It was a amazing experience I will never forget.;46.7478;-93.9484
