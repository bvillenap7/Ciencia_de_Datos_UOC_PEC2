moving light in sky, changed direction and disappeared;2003-11-10 07:30:00;20 seconds;moving light in sky, changed direction and disappeared Saw a bright white light in the sky approx. as big as a cigarrete butt in diameter. Moved to the northeast, approx. 5 miles, then turned and went straight into the air until it disappeared from sight into the sky. Light moved at an incredible pace, no noise, no contrail, no strobe or wing lights.I do not know how far away it was, or how far it travelled. I estimate it was 15 miles away, and travelled a total of 12 - 15? miles. The light was accelerating from the time I saw it, until it disappeared.;46.8716;-95.9938
