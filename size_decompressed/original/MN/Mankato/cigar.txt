bright objects in the sky that two us aircraft went over to investigate;2002-08-19 20:30:00;15 minutes;bright objects in the sky that two us aircraft went over to investigate there were about 4 unidentified objects in the sky.  3 of them were about an inch in length on the horizon, west of Mankato.  the best description of them would be like a star wars light saber.  they were bright and moving west to east.  there was another one, but this one looked different due to it's path and us observing it.  it was only about 2 cm in length.  looked like it was moving away from us.  kind of east to west.  all of them moved slowly.  two government aircraft were dispatched apparently from the north of us.  we saw them fly over us and fly in the direction of the objects.  really weird.  two witnesses.;44.1659157434407;-94.0140524781327
