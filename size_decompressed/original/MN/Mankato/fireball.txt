round green fireball;2004-11-06 01:15:00;1 min;round green fireball On 11-6-04 at 1:15 am i went out to the deck for a smoke and something caught my eye.  At first I thought it was a falling star.  It was a bright green round object that started falling down then swooped up and flew away at unbelievable speeds.  The funny thing is that me and a friend saw the same type of thing about 8-10 years ago...It almost looks like a green ball of a roman candle but much clearer and moving in different dirrections.;44.1659157434407;-94.0140524781327
