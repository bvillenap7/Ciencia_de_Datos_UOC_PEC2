I stopped to look at it ,it did not move like for 4 mins and then i suddenly saw it moving from north east direction to south west .When it flew over me , there was no noise at all , I looked up saw a diamond shape more like rhombus with bright lights at each end and in the center. i am reporting it late after seeing o many videos on youtube which I happened to see accidentally .Now I can say it was an UFO.;44.1659157434407;-94.0140524781327
