I was spending time at a friend's house late that night, we were sitting outside talking when we both noticed a slight flash off to our side that only lasted a split second, by the time we could react and look, it was gone. However, we could recall it moving sideways for it quick duration. Not two minutes later it passed again, but this time we were looking in the general direction from having interest. Again lasting only a second, it was very far away and was seemingly very large, or was extremely bright. We could both describe it as if someone was shining a flashlight on the clouds, except there were no clouds, which left us obviously baffled at what we just saw. I will honestly say that I don't know for sure whether or not it was extraterrestrial, or maybe an atmospheric phenomenon, which I could believe both to be possible scenarios.;46.2889;-94.5629
