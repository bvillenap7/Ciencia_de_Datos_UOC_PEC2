Bright light shot across the sky. It wasn't as fast as a shooting star but faster then a plane or a satilight. ((anonymous report));2016-12-04 19:00:00;5 minutes;As we were driving a bright light shot across the sky.  It wasn't as fast as a shooting star but faster then a plane or a satilight.  As soon as it went past I thought that was a weird shooting star.  As we went out of town there was a weird bright orange light hovering off in the distance.  It was orange in color and I thought maybe we could see Mars but as we were searching what Mars looks like in the sky we went back to look at the light and it was gone. I know it wasn't a plane because it was a solid light not a blinking light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.5402;-95.1224
