The moon and stars were especially clear on this night. My girlfriend, brother and I noticed a close cluster of 6 stars which were twinkling.  It was very unusual for us because we all agreed that we have never noticed this cluster of stars.   After observing this cluster we noticed there were changes in the formation of the lights and they were moving towards Orion's belt area.  They sometimes changed formations but tried to maintain a V formation as they journeyed towards Orion's belt.  Even until an hour later they are there but are as far away as stars would be.  My digital and video camera were unable to pick up the pictures.  I called the Police Department and was informed there was very little they can do.;44.9406052631579;-93.4351105263158
