Formation of red lights over Hopkins, MN.;2013-11-28 19:45:00;5 minutes;Formation of red lights over Hopkins, MN We were driving back from Thanksgiving dinner and when taking exit to Minnetonka Blvd from 169 South to the South West there was a formation of red lights in the sky.  They were about 20 or 30 bright red dots.   We thought they were perhaps a remnant of a firework but they got brighter and were stationary.   We tried to find a dark spot to see better but when we did the lights gradually disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Mulitple points of orange-colored lights moving in formation over the ground and then accelerating into space.;2016-01-30 21:00:00;3 minutes;Mulitple points of orange-colored lights moving in formation over the ground and then accelerating into space. From the area of central Hopkins looking directly west, I observed what initially appeared to be a large display of fireworks.  Since the individual points of orange-colored light did not diminish in intensity over time, and appeared to be moving towards me,   I then thought I was looking at a very large formation of individual aircraft.  I then noticed that the lights continued to accelerate and move in different directions, with all of the lights accelerating upwards in the sky.  At first there were about 25 individual points of light visible moving through the sky, but the individual points began to dim until only one light remained visible.   This last point of light lasted about a full minute longer than the others, and I watched it until it seemed to rise beyond 50,000 ft. in the atmosphere.  There was no sound associated with these lights and no air bursts as one would expect with fireworks. When I first noticed the grouping of lights I called my wife over to witness the event.  She had the same initial perception that this seemed to be either fireworks or a formation of airplanes, but then we witnessed the lights accelerating skyward, at which point we could not rationalize what we were observing.   I captured some of these lights in a video on an iPhone.;44.9406052631579;-93.4351105263158
