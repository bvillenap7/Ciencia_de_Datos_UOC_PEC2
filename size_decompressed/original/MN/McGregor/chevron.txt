We could hear it coming before we saw it. It was around midnight so it was dark and all you could see was the lights. There were four white lights on the rear of the craft in the shape of a diamond and two red lights on each wing, Maybe one on the end of the wing and one in the middle of the wings. None of the lights were blinking like all the other aircraft in the sky today. The lights on the wings were angled back so you could tell that the wings were swepted back like a jet. It reminded me of a Stealth only in a much much larger scale. At first I thought it was more than one plane flying in formation but the lights would'nt have made any sense, because there would have been only one plane with the four white lights on the back of it and four other planes flying with only one red light. So it came to our conclusion that it could only be one plane. Antway it continued across the lake and at that point we could see two other planes coming across the sky at a very fast rate of speed to meet up with it and fly almost like escorting it till it was out of our sight. About twenty minutes later a squadron of planes flew over us in the same exact spot and the same direction almost like they were trying to duplicate what the other had just done. Only the precision flying wasn't there, and the lights were blinking on these planes. They had red and white lights on them too. Only each plane had red and white lights on them. After a while another squadron of them flew the same way and a little while another squadron. All of these planes had both red and white lights blinking on them. Thats why I think that the first one we saw was one big craft.;46.6111;-93.3065
