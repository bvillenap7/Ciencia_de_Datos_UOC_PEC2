Oval blueish Orb zig zaging as it moves and dissapears suddenly.;2012-06-09 02:30:00;30 minutes;Oval blueish Orb zig zaging as it moves and dissapears suddenly. My wife and I went outside for a smoke after watching a movie and noticed a bright blueish oval light directly above us.  It was moving from south to north and then dimmed down to a small redish light and then disappeared all together.   We walked into our yard and to the west just above our house was the same bluish orb again.  It was slowly moving to the east now and seemed to jump back and forth zig zaging as it moved.  We watched this for about 30 min until it went behind some trees and we were unable to see it anymore.    Also when it was about midway across the sky we heard a neighbor yell look at that.  Not sure where the neighbor was but it was extreamly quit that night and you could hear a pin drop so not sure if they were close to us or not but it sounded like they were.   About this time my wife looked up into the sky and said look at them all.  Just above us south of the blusish orb were what looked like thousands of stars moving in all different dire! ctions.  They seemed to be following this cloud formation that was moving north.  What was odd was there was no wind that night and you could not hear anything in the sky.   I said if it was a plane we would hear it and also planes flash.  Just as quickly as those lights apeared they all seemed to disapear.  I made the comment I think there moving with the clouds.  My wife then got real scared and ran into the house to make sure the kids were OK.   We had just an overall feeling of uneasyness that kept me looking out the windows for the rest of the night until the sun came up.   This happened about 2:30 am on June 9th;47.6559;-96.1728
