Three lights in a perfect triangle inched across the sky until directly above, then seemingly disappeared.;2004-07-15 23:30:00;5 minutes;Three lights in a perfect triangle inched across the sky until directly above, then seemingly disappeared. We had just arrived to the summer cabin late that night, and a friend and I sat out on the porch to relax.  As we were talking, I was star-gazing because it is always so much more impressive outside of the cities (of course).  I soon noticed what I thought were three stars in a perfect triangle at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon.  They were inching along in the sky for about 5 minutes.  These three stars eventually worked their way up practically directly above us in the sky, then shot simultaneously and were gone without a trace.  We were both 17 at the time, and not quite sure what to make of it.  I have seen a shooting star before, but never 3 in a perfect triangle moving together then shooting out of sight at the same time.
