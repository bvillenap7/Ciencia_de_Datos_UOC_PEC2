We both saw and orange looking light in the sky that looked like a fireball in our telescope moving from SE to SW,  I explained to him that it wasn't a plane, 2 plane's passed after that 1 with flashing led light's,  And another with orange and green flashing light's. This fireball looking object was moving in a sporadic pattern from vertical to zig zag formation's hiding behind clouds as much as possible. when the 2nd plane passed by this fireball object  froze in the sky as it passed by the fireball object started moving in the same pattern's as it was, almost as if it didn't want to be seen moving in the sky as the plane passed by.  Now at 8:30pm this fireball looking object is sitting still in the night sky in the S to SW position. after this we grabbed more family member's to come outside and look at what we saw. still looking at it in our telescope as the night goes on. still no movement.;44.1518;-92.4819
