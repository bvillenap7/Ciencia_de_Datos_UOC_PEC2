Silver-white circles of light moving in circles parallel then reoccurring vertical rectangles that glowed brightly then faded x 3.;2015-10-15 08:45:00;45 minutes;Silver-white circles of light moving in circles parallel, then re-occurring vertical rectangles that glowed brightly then faded x3. From a porch on a hill looked across Caribou Lake and saw multiple silver-white circles (like stars but larger) moving in widening circles and parallel to one another across the horizon.   They moved slowly west then returned.  Repeated the movement then as they went low on the western horizon suddenly a large golden glow appeared directly above the hill across our bay.  It glowed gold, almost flame-like, then disappeared.  Nothing for a few minutes then the golden glow returned, a bit to the west.  When I stared at it, it appeared to be 3 vertical rectangles of golden light perfectly parallel to one another.  After a 10 second glow, it disappeared.  Reappeared once farther to the west.  During this gold glow action, the silver/ white round lights that I first mentioned continued to move in circles on the horizon.;47.6798;-90.6404
