It looked like dissapearing satellites;2001-04-25 21:35:00;1 minute;It looked like dissapearing satellites I was on the deck letting my dog out for one last time this evening. To the south east at the point of a bright star, there was one very bright object moving south to north. I thought it was a satellite, but it disappeared after a 5 inch movement across the ski and on a clear evening. A few seconds later the same or another burst came on the same path and disapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  The description is not inconsistent, we observe, with a tumbling satellite, or rocket booster, but it should have continued to be visible as it moved to the north, I.e. toward the sun, which would have been shining over the north-northwest horizon at this time of night.

~ 50 simple white lights travelling SW to NE, ability to adjust speed and fly in formation.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-17 22:00:00;30 minutes;~ 50 simple white lights travelling SW to NE, ability to adjust speed and fly in formation My girlfriend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette and noticed a train of lights directly overhead moving SW to NE, I've looked into the Starlink stuff and am unconvinced. I don't know how long it had been going on beforehand, but by the time we noticed, they were spaced a fair distance apart and were not in a perfect line. Some slowed down, seemingly to let others pass. Initially it was a line, then there was a Chevron formation of 3 that eventually broke to let one pass. They turned slightly at a specific point in the sky.  After about 20 minutes of a steady stream of them, they traffic cleared up and stragglers continued to appear. When at a certain point overhead, they would get very bright and back to the average luminosity. They were very fast in our opinion, but were able to adjust speed.  If they were all in a straight line like I've seen for Starlink I'd believe that to be the case, but that's not what happened.;48.7048;-95.7504
