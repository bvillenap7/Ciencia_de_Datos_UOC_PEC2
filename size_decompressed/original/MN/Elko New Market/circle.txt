Ring of lights spotted over Twin Cities in Minnesota.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect advertising lights from a casino.  PD));2016-09-09 23:39:00;4 hours;Ring of lights spotted over Twin Cities in Minnesota. I snuck out of the house with my two other friends on September 9th, and ended up seeing something really weird in the sky.  We tried to debunk it and find an explanation but we couldn't.   I took two photos of it, it was like a ring of lights in the sky that never moved but eventually just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect advertising lights from a casino.  PD));44.5616;-93.3275
