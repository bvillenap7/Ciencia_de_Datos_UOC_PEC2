Oval shaped cloud mass moving through sky on a clear night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Out-gassing event of spent rocket.  PD));2015-06-22 22:50:00;3:00;Oval shaped &quotcloud&quot mass moving through sky on a clear night. While observing Northern Lights, we (2 people) saw a large oval shaped mass of what appeared to be clouds, moving slowly across the sky directly overhead.  It looked as if the “clouds” were surrounding something slowly moving through the sky but we were unable to see any specific object.   It was moving slower than a commercial plane and appeared to be at a high altitude.  No lights could be seen coming from the mass.  The mass was large, almost as if a spotlight was shining in the sky but there were no clouds in the sky to be observed.   It was moving in a very straight north westerly direction and eventually dissipated in the distance.    One thought was that something was reflecting down on the atmosphere from space, like a reverse spotlight, such as the space station but in checking online the space station was not in our area. ((NUFORC Note:  Out-gassing event of spent rocket.  PD)) ((NOTE FROM MR. TED MOLCZAN)) Hello Peter, Your hunch probably is correct. The Sentinel 2A satellite was launched on a Vega rocket from the Guiana Space Center, last night at 9:52 PM EDT (Jun 23 01:52 UTC). Coverage of the launch was here: http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/06/22/vv05-mission-status-center/ SeeSat-L received several reports of sightings near 23:49 EDT (3:49 UTC), of what appears to have been exhaust from the final burn of the Vega rocket's AVUM liquid fueled upper stage. That burn lowered the perigee to ensure that the object decays from orbit within a reasonable time, in order to curb the growth of space debris. http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0193.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0194.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0195.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0198.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0199.html  Marco Langbroek blogged his analysis: http://sattrackcam.blogspot.nl/2015/06/aurora-hunter-images-last-moments-of.html Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

I seen a flash outside above the tree line in the north west direction towards Anoka, Minnesota.  I stay in Champlin, so at first I thought it was just a thunderstorm approaching.  Until 15 min later around 1030pm, I seen the flash again. This time it looked like it was the color red, and it seemed to have lit up the sky above the tree line. I am 24 years old, I know what lightning looks like.  It was weird that it seemed to have the brightest parts in the same spot each time closest to the trees.  It flashed about 10-15 times at 1030, and I didnt see it again the rest of the night. I thought it could have been a storm approaching, and thought I could have imagined it being a reddish  color.  When I looked up current radar of the area on my phone, I didnt see anything near the area, my thoughts went straight to this show I watched.  It showed a flash of light in the sky lighting it up from near the ground.  All I can think of that would have been this, was something paranormal. Hope someone else saw what I had last night. I keep replaying it in my head, thinking maybe I've been binge watching these shows too much at night and just imagined something happening around me.  It was so realistic, everything about it.  I swear it was the color red too!!  So strange!!;45.1713;-93.3872000000001
