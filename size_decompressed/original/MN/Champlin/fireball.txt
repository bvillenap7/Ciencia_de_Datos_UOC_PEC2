blue fireball descending;2004-03-21 19:21:00;10 seconds;blue fireball descending we were driving north on us highway 169. as we looked to the east, three of us saw what seemed to be a blue light hurtling towards the ground some distance away. we were afraid it was an airplane. we never saw an explosion, the blue fireball just disappeared from view behind the tree line. i speculated that perhaps it was a helicopter landing on a nearby (15 miles away) hospital ( unity hospital, fridley, mn) and then I decided to check for any websites that might have information and I found this one. it was very eerie that others have seen this blue ball of light- the picture shown was the exact same thing we saw.yikes.
