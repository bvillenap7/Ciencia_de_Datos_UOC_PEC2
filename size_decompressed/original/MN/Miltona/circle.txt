Circular object follows car, 4 witnesses.;1996-02-14 21:30:00;20minutes;Circular object follows car, 4 witnesses. A single bright circular object was seen hovering over a friend's house, whom of which we were picking up to go to dinner on Valentine's Night. This object followed the car as we left, and proceeded to follow us through more than 8 miles along a gravel road. Along the way we didn't encounter any other vehicles. The object made no noise except for a slight humm, and stayed along the right hand side of the car, just above the treeline. There were 4 witnesses in the car, who all claimed to have seen the same thing. As we turned onto a highway, the UFO followed us from behind, and a huge spotlight came down, covering a large feild on one side of the road, and the highway behind us. It was following closely, and seemed to be catching up to us, and another car came over a hill from the other way, and the object seemed almost to disappear from view, it didn't exactly disappear, but it moved much more quickly than any manmade craft is able to. We checked as soon as we reached our destination and it seems that we didn't lose any time. I saw the craft numerous times after, always hovering near the house at night after dark, and two other witnesses who were in the car claim to have seen it other times afterwards. It was a different shape when it would hover near my house, it would change shapes to the pattern of the moon. If there was a half moon, it too would be a half circle, and if it was a sliver moon, it would be a sliver too, but it changed colors from white, to yellow, to orange, and even red. It would hover very closely, and would wake me up out of a sound sleep. I haven't seen it since August of 1996, and the last time, I was with two other witnesses who saw it zip across the sky. I can count over 10 witnesses in the year of 1996 who have all seen the same object that year in the same area.;46.0545;-95.3258
