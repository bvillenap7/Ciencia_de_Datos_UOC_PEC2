Silent delta-shaped object seen in Savage, MN against clear October night sky.;2002-10-14 01:22:00;10 seconds;Silent delta-shaped object seen in Savage, MN against clear October night sky. Observed a delta-shaped object in clear skies.  Object had 3 soft white lights at the vertices which shone downward.  Approximately 40 feet in width.  No other discernable lights or charactaristics.  Moved in a south by southwesterly direction at approximately 150kts.  Appeared to be about 1500 feet AGL.  Made no sound, though it appeared close enough to be audible if it had jet enines.  Left no contrails.  Observed maintaining straight and level course for about 5 seconds, then rolled right to a 45 degree angle which caused the downward lights to shine brighter, as they were directed more towards the observer.  After 1 second, object then rolled left back to a straight and level position.  Object never appeared to change course or altitude during this rolling activity.  Lost track of object due to distance and the horizon.  Event took place near the intersection of Highway 13 and County Road 42 in Savage, MN while facing westward, and up at about a 30 degree angle.  Background was a dark sky with a few visible stars, including Orion in the east.  Highway 13 was illuminated, but obscured by a small hill in front of the observer.  Slight glow seen over the crest of the hill from these lights, as well as the columns of light from        Lake        to the west.  Object was just west of Highway 13, but certainly east of        Lake, as it was observed passing in front of the beams of light from the casino.  Observer is a pilot and is familliar with the air traffic around Minneapolis International Airport, about 20 miles to the northeast.  This object did not conform to any recognizable aircraft lighting or flight patterns around MSP.  No navigational lighting, beacon, or landing lights were observed.  Object could not have been part of the air traffic pattern from MSP, as it was far too low.  Also, the sudden rolling activity seemed very uncharacteristic for commercial aircraft.  Lack of sound and contrails is very curious.;44.7617;-93.3431999999999
Triangular object, able to zig-zag in-flight without changing object orientation emitted a beam and disappeared.;2013-10-26 20:15:00;2 minutes;Triangular object, able to zig-zag in-flight without changing object orientation emitted a beam and disappeared. Observer 1:  Corporate exec, no previous sightings very familiar with the night sky in Savage used to seeing planes and helicopters in the airspace above the house not prone to hysteria.  Observer 2:  Healthcare professional, no previous sightings.  Observer 3:  Daughter of observer 2, currently attending cosmetology school. I was standing on my deck last night (facing south), talking with a friend.  I happened to look to the west, and a moving light caught my eye.  It was approximately at a 75% angle from my position, moving ESE. I watched it for several seconds, arcing across the sky.  It was moving fairly quickly, but clearly wasn't a plane.  I thought it might be a satellite, but then I realized this was definitely much lower than others I've seen. I pointed it out to my friend, asking her what she thought it was. She suggested satellite as we watched the object continuing to cross the sky. Suddenly, the object zig-zagged several times. I said, Did that just zig-zag? My friend concurred. As the object continued toward the east, it appeared to be descending enough so that we could now see a little detail (versus a bright white light).  The object was clearly triangular in shape.  We asked her daughter to join us on the deck and she observed the object with us until the end of the sighting. The object zig-zagged again and then suddenly just stopped.  At that point, we were flabbergasted.  None of us have ever seen anything like this.  The object then appeared to shoot a beam of some kind toward the south - but it was short, seemed controlled.  As soon as it stopped emitting the light, it began moving east again, heading toward some cloud cover.  Before it ever got there, it just suddenly disappeared. We went out several times after this to see if there was anything else out there, but have seen nothing.;44.7617;-93.3431999999999
2 triangular objects with ability to change direction without banking also able to disappear suddenly.;2015-05-24 23:30:00;5 minutes;2 triangular objects with ability to change direction without banking also able to disappear suddenly. My first report was in Q4 2013.  A friend and I had observed something from my deck.  I've since seen in several times, including on this date with a different friend of mine. We were sitting on my deck, talking and enjoying a cool evening, when a fast-moving light coming up out of the south caught my eye.  I pointed it out to my friend and he and I watched as the object continued to move north.   As it began to pass over our heads (quite high, but not high enough to be a satellite), the object zig-zagged, and then suddenly made a 90Â° turn toward the east.  There was no banking like a plane would have to do-it was a complete and immediate change of direction. The object continued toward the east before changing direction and heading north once again before suddenly disappearing.  My friend and I stayed on my deck, trying to find the object, but we were unsuccessful.  What we did see, however, was another object traveling rapidly up from the south, following approximately the same trajectory as the previous object.  This object also changed direction abruptly, but this time this one went west.  It zig zagged several times and then suddenly disappeared. Not long after these two objects were observed, we heard planes passing overhead at a rapid rate of speed-but we were unable to get out to the deck to see them.    Savage had not been in the flight path for MSP or Flying Cloud on this night, so it was surprising to see aircraft in the vicinity.;44.7617;-93.3431999999999
