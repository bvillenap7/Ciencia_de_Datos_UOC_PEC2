Of coarse I tried to rationalize it with well it could've been, but still was left feeling like I saw something I can't explain.   I told some friends and family only to hear the usual banter that would come from a ufo sighting making me feel the way others say they felt when telling there stories, just wishing someone else had seen what I saw anyway now I'm one of those guys.   38 years old and not crazy....u tell me...

Circle of lights in the savage sky.;2015-08-09 22:50:00;25 minutes;Circle of lights in the savage sky. There was a circle of 13 individual lights, stationary. In watching them, the upper left quadrant faded, then eventually came back.  During that time the right lower quadrant faded, then the lower half faded.  All lights then came back and slower start to fade individually.  After 20 min, all but 3 lights on the left side remained, then a group of three in a different formation came back.  It looks like it reformed but my view is blocked by large trees.  As it is humid and cloud covered tonight, it was easy to see the lights weren't coming from the ground, pointing upward.  There was no light trail and we live in an area that doesn't have dealership lights, sales lights, etc. during this time, both pets were feverishly running to the windows and l Starring at the lights.  After that last group faded, they finally laid back down. all pictures I took ended up completely white.  All video was black. ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected advertising lights at a local casino.
