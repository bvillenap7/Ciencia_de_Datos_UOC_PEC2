We were coming home from a family birthday party and our kids were in the car behind us. Out of nowhere, coming from behind us and swooping over us was this incredibly bright white light moving silently past us. It was so white that I remember thinking that the on-coming head lights looked like a dull yellow. I have seen what looked like falling stars in the past, but this wasn't like that. It came right over us and everyone else on the freeway at that time.There was no noise. We called our kids in the car behind us right away and they too were in total amazement. It flew or glided horizontally unbelievably fast and when it reached the horizon you could see colors below it. I don't know how high it was, but if the IDS building were standing in the middle of the freeway, it would have smashed into it. What was it that we saw? and why didn't it hit the news? scary stuff;45.2433;-94.1031
