((HOAX??))  Green light, slowly moving in the sky and then vanishes.;2018-02-15 22:00:00;10 seconds;Green light, slowly moving in the sky and then vanishes. I was driving on a dirt road at 10pm and I see this green light in the sky, maybe about 70 feet in front of me and about 30 feet in the air.  It went up, then down, and then after a few seconds, I saw the light just move slowly, then it vanishes, nothing in sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to contact the source of the report, in order to confirm the date, and were greeted by a string of profanity.  Hoax?  PD));47.5832;-95.7428
