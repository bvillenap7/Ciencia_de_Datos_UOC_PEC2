Green fireball north of Maple Lake, Minnesota;2009-10-17 21:30:00;1/2 second;Green fireball north of Maple Lake, Minnesota The object looked just like a roman candle (it was green), only it was too high in the sky, estimated at an altitude of 2000 feet.  It traveled from south to north in a straight line.  I was driving east and saw it out the drivers side window, looking almost straight up.   It disappeared (burned out, like a meteorite) after traveling about 20 degrees (that is, assuming 180 degrees from horizon to horizon, it traveled a fraction of that).  There were no sparks or a tail, just a bright green glow as if from a roman candle.  I was in farm country and there were no houses nearby.  A little background: I am a geologist (masters degree) who specializes in concrete analysis.  51 year old male.  Sober and drug free.;45.2213;-93.9694
