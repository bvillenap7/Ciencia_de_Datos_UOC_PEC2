((Starlink satellites??));2021-05-04 21:55:00;2 minutes;On Tuesday, May 4th at 21:50 hours, I saw a string of lights in an absolute straight line flying silently across the sky from West to East.  They went about as fast as a passenger jet and appeared to be at about 10,000 feet. They covered a very long area. As it went farther east, it disappeared all at once. I watched from my deck for several minutes. When I talked to the gentleman at the UFO Reporting Center, he thought that it was most probably Elon Musks Starlight project.  I had never seen this phenomenon before.;45.2213;-93.9694
