There was an intense lightning storm that covered about half of the night sky {covering the sky from the S.W. to the N.E. the other half of the sky was clear with stars clearly visable), the storm was headed in a N.E. direction.  We saw 25-50 orange-yellow lights come out of the storm (to our S.E.) cross the road in front of us and continue in a West - N.W. direction.  We pulled onto the shoulder of the road and watched them go higher and higher in the sky until they all disappeared.  Their were a lot of other cars on the road that night but I have not heard of anyone else reporting this event.  I did call the local Police but no one else had reported it.  I also called channel 4 news, but no one had called them either.;45.5856;-93.5935
