White quick moving light in eastern Mn sky before sunrise.;2012-10-20 06:05:00;31 minutes;White quick moving light in eastern Mn sky before sunrise Looking into eastern sky before sunrise, bright light changing from white to red, then green on a SE heading aprox 135 degrees.  Light moves very swiftly from left to right, down then up in short quick movements. sun has yet to rise, I am facing east so no sun reflection on this. took out my telescope but was unable to focus on quick moving object.  No sounds on a very quiet morning. Was abole to view thru Binoculars and was amazed as it took such quick movements. at aprox. 6:41am, light uimmiediately went dark.  Sun has yet to rise, it is now 6:44am, light has reappeared briefly on a heading of aprox. 180 degrees due south and is now absent from visual sky.  There are no flashing light, just a suttle change in color with white being prominent with suttle flashes of red & green.  I have seen this type of similar movement on eastern & northern sky on headings of 030-090 degrees but never this close. what is so startling is the sudden and extremly quick moevements and sudden stops.  I have never seen such sharp, quick movements in an object like this ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.5856;-93.5935
