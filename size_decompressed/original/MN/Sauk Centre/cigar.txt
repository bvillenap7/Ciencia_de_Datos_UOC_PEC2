Appeared invisible, except for white head and tail light. Elongated fixed object gliding northeast without noise.  Too large, low, slow, and quiet to be an airplane.  It had one bright but hazy white light in front and a smaller bright white light (no haze) on the tail end.  The rest of it appeared to be invisible, except for these two lights.  Where the mid section would be, there was small white light that appeared to blink slow and irregular.   This was at 7:00 a.m., and it was dark enough to see the stars.  At first I thought I was looking at stars until I noticed it was moving.   Then, I could tell that it was much much closer than any stars could be.  It was much closer than an airplane would fly.;45.7272;-94.9636
