Last night 10/01/2012 my husband went to bed about 9:00 around 10:30 he told me to go out side and look at the things flying over the house...so I did...there was 2 things flying low enough that you should have been able to hear them, yet they were silent...and had a weird shape (kinda triangle shape but long) ....they flow side by side to what I'm guessing was over Sauk lake...then one went to the left and one went right and looked like they just stopped.. then there was a airplane flying over ...way higher up and I could hear it just fine...it flow right in the middle of the other two and keep on going until you couldn't see it any more.  I watch them for about an other 20 minutes and then they just disappeared. How weird?;45.7272;-94.9636
