As we(me and 4 other friends)were heading West-bound on I-94 between Fergus Falls, Mn. and Rothsay, Mn.  We witnessed four unknown craft that were cigar-shaped and appeared light orange in color were flying erratically(sometimes motionless)some distance from one another.  After approximately five minutes each of the four craft left moving slowly in different directions and then left quickly almost as if they disappeared.  One of the four craft was visible for about 15 more seconds after the others vanished then was gone also.;46.5069;-96.2854
