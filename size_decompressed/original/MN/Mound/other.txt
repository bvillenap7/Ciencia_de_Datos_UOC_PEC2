large boeing 747 followed by two smaller craft.;2001-10-21 14:00:00;1 minute;large boeing 747 followed by two smaller craft. I was helping a friend of mine built a shed, we were talking when four airplanes flew low over our heads.  Once they passed I noticed a Boeing 747 higher in the sky traveling east to west.  What was strange was the two smaller planes following the large 747. At first I thought the smaller planes were escorts (like maybe it was the President's plane with two fighter escorts)  But the smaller planes were both on the left side of the 747. They were dark in color but surrounded by a translucent cirle. by  Then the 747 started to turn south and the two smaller planes did an ariel loop-de-loop and ended up behind the 747. Then the two smaller planes sped off so fast I couldn't tell in what direction they traveled. I kept asking my friend if he could see the two small planes.  We both concluded that the two smaller planes had vanished. We could still see the 747.;44.9388;-93.6556
