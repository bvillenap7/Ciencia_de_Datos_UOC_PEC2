Bright light against sun, magnificent brightness and maneuverability through clouds, dim to dark and bright.  ((anonymous report));2017-02-10 15:00:00;5 minutes;Bright light against sun, magnificent brightness and maneuverability through clouds, dim to dark and bright, two objects total. On hwy 13 westbound heading towards 77, I saw a bright light in the sky far away and high up in the west sky.  It remained much brighter than an airplane and was against the sunlight.  The light became very intense for about 1.5 seconds and went back to just bright.   I thought perhaps it was a meteorite entering the atmosphere but then the object seemed to maneuver around through the clouds (far distance away).  The object stopped being bright for several seconds and looked simply dark.   There was another object near the first objects location, both moving around very quickly and far away from my location (possibly several miles), both identical in appearance but not in sync.   When the first object reached maximum brightness, my heart dropped, this looked like nothing ever seen before and its movements felt playful in nature, as it maneuvered through the clouds.
