Blue flashes in the sky followed by an unusual aircraft.;2013-11-10 00:55:00;15 minutes;Blue flashes in the sky followed by an unusual aircraft. We were walking the dog.  When we got back to our house, a giant blue flash  occurred  in the sky.  It looked like heat lightnig in the middle of the summer.  But it's not summer and it wasn't storming and it was blue.  The flash happened three times. There was no noise.  Then, there was a faint noise that sounded like an old airplane.  It was coming straight.  But took a very sharp turn, I would say about 90 degrees, in the direction of the lights.  The aircraft did have wings and lights like a plane.  The plane was circling the area  and continued to make unusually sharp turns.  Them, it began to hover in the sky.  A searchlight then beamed down  from the airplane.;44.82675;-93.1583
