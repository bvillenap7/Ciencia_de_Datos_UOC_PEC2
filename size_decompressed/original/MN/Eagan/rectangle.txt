Not moving, just perfectly still above the tree line.  I waited to see if it could be an airplane in distress.  Then an airplane was higher in the sky and I knew this was much, much larger than a regular plane.  So I ran in to get my binoculars, I looked through them and it was just a glistening huge ball of light.  So I thought I will wake my husband so he could see.  He came out, looked through the binoculors and said, I don't know what it is, what do you think it is?  I said I did not know.  So he went back inside.  Within minutes it slowly drifted across in a straight line.  I waited, and after some minutes it slowly started moving towards my home, the closer it got the faster the speed was.  I watched it go over my head, still very brilliant.  I heard a faint sound of a muffled engine.  The center of the object had a small red light, the rest of the lights were brilliant white (with that sparkly glow).  I could not make out the shape very clearly because by this time the speed had increased.  But I only made out a pointed side heading east, with a small tail shape as in a tail of a plane where the logo usually is.  But comparing it to a regular plane, it was considerably larger!  I watched it as it moved out of sight.;44.82675;-93.1583
