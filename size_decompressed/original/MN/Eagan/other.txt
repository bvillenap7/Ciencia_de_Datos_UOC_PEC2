I was at the shopping mall on Town Centre Drive with my 11 year old daughter.  The sky was clear and blue but sunny, when I looked up to the east I saw this translucent white eyelet shaped object at 12 o'clock high.  It looked like an upside down horseshoe shape at the top, the bottom came together like a button hole.   The object appeared to be luminous, it just hung there in the sky, at first it was completely stationary for at least 7 minutes, then all at once it was further away and slightly dimmer, although in the same position in the sky.   Initially, I hesitated to tell my daughter, I was worried that she might be frightened.  But, when I pointed it out she smiled and she became very happy and excited.  I have waited for years to see a UFO and now that I have, I hope that what I witnessed was a real spaceship and not some government spy craft.  Thank you.;44.82675;-93.1583
