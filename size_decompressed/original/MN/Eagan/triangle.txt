((HOAX??))  Shimmering triangle, high altitude, intelligently controlled over Eagan, Minnesota.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2013-09-30 20:30:00;45 minutes;Shimmering triangle, high altitude, intelligently controlled over Eagan, Minnesota. Last night we saw a shimmering triangular craft high in the sky.  At first we thought it may be a planet or star, but it would move slowly every few minutes, sometimes changing it's position or direction.  We don't have binoculars or a telescope, but we were flashing a big flash light up at the craft, my two children and I were waving and trying to send messages to it telepathically, asking the aliens to please come down and visit us if they are a benevolent species.  We told them that we would try not to be afraid if they came to our house.  The craft was at first positioned north of our townhouse, then it moved directly overhead.  We were outside on our deck watching it and trying to communicate with it and the craft seemed to become brighter for a brief moment.  I had to take the kids inside at inside at around 21:15 so they could get ready for bed.  We are now very hopeful, we have been seeing UFO's occasionally for several months.  My children and I belie! ve that if continue trying to initiate contact, we may have success.  If the aliens do visit our home we intend to send you a picture Mr. Davenport.  PS.  There is no need to call me back at this time, I'll call you as soon as I get a photo of the aliens or the UFO up close.  Thank you.;44.82675;-93.1583
