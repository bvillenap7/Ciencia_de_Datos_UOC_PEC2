5 Dark Round-Orbs in a String Form Decending form the Cloud Bank;2005-06-07 13:00:00;2 or 3 minutes;5 Dark Round-Orbs in a String Form Decending form the Cloud Bank I saw 5 round orbs flying down out of a cloud bank and I grabbed my digital camera (Fine Pix S3000) and started shooting some pictures. I only was able to get one that came out visable. They were moving at a moderate speed and move up, down and looped back up into the cloud bank out of my vision. They were a dark - grey/blackish color, and in the photo they look black. It was a grey day and you can see a tree top in the  bottom of the photo - but the most incredible part is the 5 orbs/ships that are what looks like stringing down in formation of some kind from the clouds.;44.82675;-93.1583
((NUFORC Note:  Possible star.  PD))  Bright colorfull glowing ball.;2005-10-11 03:00:00;2 hours plus;Bright colorfull glowing ball My wife and I video taped an object glowing blue, green, red, and white in one place for about an hour out our back door from 3:00AM until 4:00AM.  Object is slowly moving from east to west sky.  Called flight services and MPLS airport reported no aircraft in the area.  My wife has seen this before and I didn't believe her.  This time she woke me up.  We don't know what this is, rotating and changing color fairly rapidly. Have video and pictures and will hope to get any explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star.

Large circle of individual lights shining through heavy cloud cover.;2015-10-04 21:30:00;2 minutes;My daughter and I were arriving home for the evening.  In the northwest sky above our block we saw a large circle of individual lights shining through heavy cloud cover.  The lights seemed to be from one large source.  The lights were bright and cast at an angle through the clouds.  As we watched, the lights simply faded away leaving the impression of a large circle in the clouds.  My daughter is 14, I am 45.;44.82675;-93.1583
