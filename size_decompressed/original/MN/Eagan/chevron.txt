Silent boomerang object szeen in sky over Eagn MN;2005-04-15 01:20:00;10 seconds;Silent boomerang object seen in sky over Eagn MN Object appeared from the southeast travelling northwest. Because of surrounding trees, about 120 degrees of shy was visible overhead.  It was a cloudless night.  The object was boomerang shaped or possibly trianglular. A series of dull lights, remimded me of amber bicycle reflectors, between five to seven of them, were arranged in a chevron pattern along the leading edge.  I am unsure if the object was boomerang shaped or triangular since the lights were an a chevron pattern and the training edge of the object was not clearly visible.  The motion of the object caught my attention since it was balck but a bit more matte and light than the backgound sky, like a silhoutte.  I initially thought from the size that I was seeing the silhouette of an eagle flying glow overhead when I first caught sight of the object from the corner of my vision, but as soon as I turned my attention to the object, I saw the lights and details.  It clearly occluded the stars in the sky.  I cannot estimate the object, but it was about the same size as a bald eagle flying about 50 feet overhead.  The object made no sound.  It traversed the arc of the sky visible to me in about 8 seconds (about 120 degrees).  The speed and direction of the object appeared constant during the time I observed it.  The lights did not flash or otherwise change shape, posiiton of color.  As I lost sight of it in the trees, I moved to a clear area which toook about 5 seconds.  I was unable to locate the object in the sky again.;44.82675;-93.1583
