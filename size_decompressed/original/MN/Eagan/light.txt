It appeared as two points of light, seperated but traveling uniformly. The object materialized, traveled very quickly on a straight path, then disappeared. I confess that the object was quite faint. The object was two points of light, seperated by just a degree or so. The lights appeared white in color and kept a constant level of brightness.  The two points of light were obviously traveling as one unit as they moved across the night sky. I just happened to look upward to admire the night sky when I left a restuaraunt and noticed the object moving on a southeast to northwest path. Within 5 seconds, the object vanished as quickly as it appeared.  The object never came near the horizon. I recently graduated from college with a degree in Sociology.  I took an Astronomy class in college and consider it somewhat of a hobby of mine.  I have seen countless shooting stars and this object was very different from anything I had seen in the night sky before. It traveled way too quickly to be a jet and there was no actual streak as is commonly observed with meteors. The intensity of the lights remained constant until it disappeared.;44.82675;-93.1583
A very clear light flying across the clear sky.;2013-06-02 23:30:00;2-4 minutes;A very clear light flying across the clear sky. Noticed by a back yard camp fire, on a clear moon-less night, one member points out a fast moving light in the sky.  Everyone looks the direction and focus on the object.  Appearing to be traveling at a high altitude, we observe the object with a bit of owe.  The fast moving consent light travels north bound from the south.  One member mentioned the surrounding stars to look almost blue-ish I'm comparison to the moving light. The interesting event that happens is the observing the light slow down as the object moves towards its destination's horizon.  Our major conversion from there on its the strange light we saw.  Everyone agrees the experience, although brief, was very unusual - as though there was something very strange with what we were seeing. No other lights were seen showing even remotely similar characteristics.;44.82675;-93.1583
Bright, erratic, movement of lights.;2015-07-24 22:44:00;2 minutes;Bright, erratic, movement of lights. Out walking my dog, randomly looked up and saw what I first thought to be a low flying satellite..then the bright light moved in a staggered line, and was soon joined by a second equally bright object.   The initial light became stationary, while the second light went back the direction it appeared from.;44.82675;-93.1583

In car at 9:30am and close to where highways 494 and 35E intersect, there was a oval light, looked like the shape of a lamp post light, that was moving around up, down diagonally, in a small area. Then it stopped and stood still until I couldn't see it getting on my exit. It was a pretty sunny, partly cloudy day and the object was not obstructed by clouds.  The area frequently has air planes but it is close to a national airport so they are pretty close to the ground and would not be mistaken for a light like this.;44.82675;-93.1583
