Black object with orange solid light traveling over townhomes in Rosemount, MN.  ((anonymous report));2017-08-04 22:30:00;5 minutes;Black object with orange solid light traveling over townhomes in Rosemount, MN. When leaving for work at 10:30 pm, I was about to enter the round-about when I noticed something in the air.  It was just above tree level, moving slowly over the park at the community center.   It then flew across the street between the park and the townhomes. The object was black with a solid orange light.  I would guess it to be large in size.  There was no sound coming from the object. It moved erratically smooth like nothing I have ever seen in the sky before. I then followed the object Southeast on Connemara Trail in Rosemount, MN, for about a mile.  The object stopped and hovered above the fire station and water-tower.  The object then took off again moving much faster heading South until it went up into the clouds. As I headed East on County Rd 42, towards hwy 52, I noticed 2 large helicopters fly over.  One circled from the oil refinery towards the airport.  The other circled from the oil refinery to Woodbury and circled back. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
