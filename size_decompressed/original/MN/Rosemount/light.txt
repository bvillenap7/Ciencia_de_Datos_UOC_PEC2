Bright object in daytime sky, MN;2004-08-19 16:00:00;1+ hours;Bright object in daytime sky, MN I'm still watching one of the objects just right above (a bit north) of my house.  Earlier there were 2, but one disappeared.  The object which appears to be either lit by sunlight or emmitting a light was moving westward and then stopped and has been hovering for about an hour.  The other one of the same descrption was to the east and moving east - then just disappeared.  As I study the one that is hovering - it seems to have lights on the bottom (but I am using a weak telescope). ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the Twin Cities area.  At first, we thought the object might be a balloon, launched from Canada, as part of the MANTRA scientific project, but the balloon had not yet been launched on August 19.  The local news media covered the event extensively.  We do not know what the object, or objects, were.  Please see other reports.  PD));44.7399000000004;-93.1248999999988
