((anonymous report));2017-04-01 22:27:00;1 minute;one flying object with huge bright light. Next minute it was going a completely different direction and was showing two green lights I was walking home, when all the sudden, I saw an extremely bright white light that looked like it was coming towards us from a distance.  I turned to my friend and said, Do you see that?  They said, Yes. About 45 seconds later, she pointed it out again, this time it was going in a completely different direction.  The back of the moving object was now showing and you could see two green lights, and it looked gray and square/diamond shaped.
