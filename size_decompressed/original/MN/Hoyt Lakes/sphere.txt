A bluish/green sphere dropped out of the sky and was observed at two different locations 65 miles apart.;2008-02-21 20:39:00;2 to 3 seconds;A bluish/green sphere dropped out of the sky and was observed at two different locations 65 miles apart. On Feb. 21 @ 20:39 (CST) I observed a bluish/green sphere shaped object dropping out of the evening sky.  The object left a very minimal trail of sparks behind it as it dropped.  Its size was like a nickel held at arms length away from the body. From my location in Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota, it was dropping at a 10 degree angle going from east to west.  It disappeared into the trees approximately 10 degrees above the horizon.  At the point it disappeared into the horizon the object was 15 degrees East of South. I mentioned this occurrence to an acquaintance who lives in Grand Rapids, Minnesota the next day and he and his wife observed the same event. They observed  the same color object which was falling straight down to earth on a line from Grand Rapids to Ironwood, Michigan,  and disappearing into the trees before hitting the horizon. Could this have been a piece of the satellite that was shot down a day earlier? ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally credible witness.
