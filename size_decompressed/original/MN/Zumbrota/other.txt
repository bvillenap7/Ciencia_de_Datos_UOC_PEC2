Octagon shaped craft made a 90 degree turn;2009-09-19 23:08:00;8 seconds;Octagon shaped craft made a 90 degree turn Saturday, Sept. 19th 11:08 PM  I like to sit on the patio at night and look for satellites. I was sitting on our patio outside relaxing after just having a house full of company leave.  I saw what I thought at first was a satellite because it was moving about the same speed they usually move. But the I noticed it wasn’t moving in a straight line, it was moving in an elongated wavy pattern. As I looked closer I could see an Octagon shape behind the light. I watched it for about 5 seconds when it took a 90 degree turn to the right and headed south at the same speed.  There was no noise whatsoever. I’m not a good one for guessing altitude but I would say it looked about the size of a quarter in the sky. It was maybe 8-10 thousand feet up.;44.3019;-92.6781
