Silver cigar shaped object travelling low, and at great speed on US 52 in SE Minnesota.;2000-12-23 16:30:00;30 sec.;Silver cigar shaped object travelling low, and at great speed on US 52 in SE Minnesota. While driving in heavy traffic two days before Christmas and returning to Rochester, Mn. from Minneapolis, Mn. on US 52, I, ((name deleted)), and ((name deleted--Witness #2)) witnessed a craft travelling at unbelievable speed from W to E., across the highway as 52 runs N. and S.  It was quite low, and kept a steady speed.  It was out of sight very quickly.  There was no sound.  It was silver and cigar shaped from a side view.  I called 911 on my cell phone and it was eventually answered by the Minnesota State Troopers.  The operator told me that he was inundated with calls about this craft.  It was such an unsusual experience that ((Witness #2)) and I looked at each other with our mouths open.  I have also worked with jet aircraft in the military for many years, and this was NOT a jet aircraft.  It left something....a pulse-like wave not in it's wake, but in front of it.  Apparently, many saw this event while driving, not just on 52, but on perpendicular and parallel roads as well.  The speed and shape were something I'd not witnessed before.  Coupled with it's lack of ANY noise, it was clearly something new, or something I'd never seen before.  There are NO major airbases in the area.  Not even an airport within 60 miles.
