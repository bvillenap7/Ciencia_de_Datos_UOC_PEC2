They kept the same distance apart and flew towards the south, southeast. Three of us were standing just outside of our house facing the east, looking up at the clear night sky.  When from our left came two circular, hazy donut shaped objects.  The two forms were situated 45 degrees from eachother.  With the forward most shape being to the southeast of the other one. They traveled to the South, southeast.  It took about three seconds for  the objects to be out of our field of vision.;44.3019;-92.6781
