There were lots of stars visible in the sky so a friend and I were watching.  Something caught my eye which appeared to be a shooting star.  I followed it with my eyes and noticed there were several lights in the shape of a triangle.  The body of the craft appeared to be translucent.  Was completely soundless and moving much faster than any aircraft I have seen.  My friend did finally get a look at it also but only maybe 3-5 seconds.;45.5957;-95.915

A friend and I were walking around town because of the nice weather it was late enough that the stars had come out.  We're both college students in our early 20s.  I was open to the existence of UFOs, but my friend had been a skeptic until the event. As we were walking, we reached an area void of streetlights (near E 4th St and Oregon Ave) and my friend was trying to find some constellations.  As he was looking, he exclaimed, Dude! Look.  I looked up just in time to see a triangular shaped craft with three lights fly silently and quickly over our heads and across the sky before flying off into the distance, heading South-West. There were no trees, so we both got a clear view of the craft.  Neither of us were certain how large or how high the object was, but it appeared perhaps around 250 feet in the air and around 20 feet long.  It flew fast enough that we were only able to watch it for around 5 seconds.  We were both confident the object was some sort of UFO.;45.5957;-95.915
