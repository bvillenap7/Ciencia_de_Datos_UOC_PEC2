Link in full description, saved picture also available opon req Well, this morning i was searching through the local elementary school webcam.  I was doing a time lapse when i ran across what i thought to be a smudge on the screen.  (The school does an hour by hour webcam shot)   Oddly enough i couldn't put my finger on it because it was not evident in any other shot that day. Heres a link:  http://www.instacam.com/InstaCAM/imagelist_by_week.asp?id=FRBLT  Run through the time lapse until you get 7/29/05 14:00. I also have a saved copy if i can figure out how to send it to you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  We have not seen the image yet.  Probably not a UFO.  PD));44.297;-93.2868999999999
