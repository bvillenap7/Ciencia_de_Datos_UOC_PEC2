It flew parallel to the terrain and emitted a long tall w/smoke & sparks. Stepped outside to have a smoke break from work. Was looking so. when a green light suddenly flashed on over the Straight River. The fireball was close enuf to light the tops of the trees on either side of the river. It travelled very slowly and parallel..so slow I expected it to fall down..but it didn't. The color was flouescent green and despite it being night I could see thick smoke trailing as well as a shower of sparks.  It was completely silent. After 2 seconds or so it suddenly just blinked off. I have not reported this in the past since there was nowhere to report to. thanks.;44.297;-93.2868999999999
