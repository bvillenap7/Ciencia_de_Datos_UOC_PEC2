We walked outside at about 9:15 pm on August 29th 2009 and looked up and noticed 5 lights in a V shape moving slowly south. We watched for about 40 seconds trying to figure out what it was when suddenly it sped up and disappeared out of site. Whatever it was made no noise whatsoever.We are used to a lot of airline traffic overhead and helicopters coming and going from the local hospital but if there is no sound the aircraft is very high and the lights very small and this seemed low enough we should have heard it. A day later someone reported in the local newspaper that they saw an orange flame in the sky. She was directly south-southeast of us by a few blocks. I imagine what she was seeing was the craft when it sped up and it became a blur before it disppeared. Is there a military craft with lights like this that makes no noise? One that can also move slowly and then take off at warp speed?;44.297;-93.2868999999999
A triangular ufo with, red, white, and green lights in each corner spotted over Minnesota.;2016-06-15 03:00:00;1 minute;A triangular ufo with, red, white, and green lights in each corner spotted over Minnesota. It was around 3:00 am at this week long figure skating camp in Faribault, Minnesota.  I was in a room sleeping with 3 of my friends, ((deleted--C) who was 10, ((deleted--L) who was 9, and me when I was 11.  I was in a bed right next to a window, L was in a bed on the other side of the room, and on the same wall as me was ((deleted--C)) in a bunked bed with a very small window looking out at the same view I was.   I was part way asleep when this fairly bright light came into my room and I heard this noise like a plane flying by.  I looked out and saw a triangular shaped ufo facing me about 20 feet away.  Also, our room was about 4 stories up, so it was floating pretty high.  In each corner of the triangle was a circular light, one that was white, red, and green.   Then I look away to ask my two other friends if they saw if and I look back and itâ€™s gone.  My friend L heard it, and my friend C was sleeping.;44.297;-93.2868999999999

The sighting lasted about four seconds and then it vanished from our sight.  It was a clear night with no planes or helicopters in the area.  It didnt not make any noise, it was only one that we saw.  Our dog started to whine at the time, which I have no idea if one t hing had to do with another but as soon as it vanished our dog settled down a few minuutes later .;44.297;-93.2868999999999
