Blue quick moving light over twin cities.;2014-04-28 23:50:00;3 seconds;Blue quick moving light over twin cities I saw one blue light move quickly across the sky.  It appeared to slow for a shooting star, and too fast for a plane.  I saw it for what was maybe 3 seconds moving at a steady speed north, then charge direction or stop.  Then I lost it while I was driving, and could not see it again.  The light to me appeared really far away, and dim, also odd as it was raining with overcast.;45.08;-93.0227
