The lights flashed brightly every few seconds, bright as two headlights on an approaching car. This is the best way I can describe them. They were really bright, but not bright enough to light up the sky. They began to circle each other, very slowly in a clockwise direction. The lights crept away from each other across the horizon. The light that was moving to the right made me think. The shadow on the moon is cast by the earth. The flashing light did not show up on the shadow. That light must have traveled behind the moon. I'm not sure the exact date of this experience but my mom and i were putting the sprinklers away for the night so i assume it was late august or more towards early spring perhaps april or may. Everyone i talked to about this said they had never heard of anything like it. We should've reported it as soon as it happened, but we didn't and i've been trying to figure out what the lights could've been ever since. I'm curious if anyone else has ever seen ne thing like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));45.08;-93.0227
