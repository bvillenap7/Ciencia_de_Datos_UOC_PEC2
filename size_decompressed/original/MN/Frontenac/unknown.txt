Soundless fast moving craft with red pulsing light on bottom;2001-03-15 21:00:00;15 sec;Soundless fast moving craft with red pulsing light on bottom My wife and I were camping at Frontenac State Park in Minnesota.  We were laying on our backs looking at a clear night sky, with approximately 160 degrees of sky visible.  I am the son of an aeronautics engineer, and have been raised around all types of commercial and military aircraft.  I grew up near an Air Force base, and have observed hundreds of various aircraft in flight, both at night and in the daytime. This particular night, while viewing the stars, an object moved toward us from the south.  It was very dark and difficult to determine the shape.  It had one distinguishing feature:  a single pulsing red light on the bottom of the craft.  The size of the pulsing light led me to determine that the craft was only a few hundred feet off the ground, yet the craft was moving at a high rate of speed with absolutely no sound.   My experience tells me that only a jet-propelled craft or very high-powered turboprop could move at this speed, typically with lots of noise associated, particularly at this altitude.   This craft was absolutely silent.  It moved south to north, spanning my field of vision in less than 15 seconds.   My wife and I both saw the craft and corroborated what we had seen and agreed completely that we had witnessed a craft that did not exist in any records or memory that we had.  That is all.
