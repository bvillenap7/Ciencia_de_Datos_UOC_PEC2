A bright star like object - pulsating red, green & yellow. Sharing binoculars with husband, the object turned disk like and had a red circle of lights on top. The red lights pulsated in a circle. My husband saw the light move up and down but by the time I got outside, it was somewhat stationary in the western sky. The movement was not like an airplane. No noise. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen. It seemed to be pulsating with energy. We watched it fade into distance.;45.2707;-92.8301

Spouse also saw it.   It held its position from about 20:20 when we first noticed it, and was still there over an hour later when we walked home.  Saw a small airplane travel in the trajectory below it which gave us scale for its height (higher than small airplanes fly, at that distance). Very confusing - I am still wondering what that was.  Sparsley populated area, have never seen these lights in that area.;45.2707;-92.8301
