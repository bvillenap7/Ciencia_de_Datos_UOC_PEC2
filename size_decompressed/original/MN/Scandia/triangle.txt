First saw a Very bright light in the sky like 4times brighter than any other star. it was gold. it moved down a little bit then up. it lit up the entire lake. then it moved faster up to the right, while it got faster it lit up in a circlular motion. the object looked like a circle at first with neon blue, red, white, and green bright blinking lights. then we heard a sound almost like a train, and we knew it was coming from the object. we knew it wasnt a plane, because a plane can't stop in mid air like the object did. It wasn't a helicoptor either, because of the sound and somewhat shape. Also very loud. it was about 400ft from the ground. when it got faster and closer it looked like a flying v shaped guitar. then it just zoomed out if sight the the south. My cellphone since then hasn't been working right. it was acting weird right after the incident. Friend took 10 seconds of video on her cellphone (not good quality of object) but you can hear sound.;45.2707;-92.8301
