Twin lighted objects floating at dusk, south east of Scandia, MN;2010-07-19 21:00:00;10-15 min.;Twin lighted objects floating at dusk, south east of Scandia, MN Observation from Latitude 45.27, Longitude –92.83, 21.00 central daylight savings time:  On the night of 07/19/10, my wife and I noticed through our great room picture window two distant lights near the South East horizon, (10 degrees elevation, 45 degrees East of South) which we hadn’t seen before. The first thought was they belonged to a new cell tower.  Further observation with 7 x 35 binoculars showed a pair of identical objects that had red glowing vertical bodies and each with a midway ring with 4 separate green lights, (from our viewing position.).  The objects appeared on the same horizontal plane in what appeared as a stationary position.  After approximately 10 minutes, the Western object’s lights faded and the shadow of it’s profile could be observed moving rapidly west on the same plane until out of sight.  (It was twilight yet one could still discern the horizon tree line and the moving unlit object.)  After another approximate 5 minutes, the Eastern object’s lights faded out and it also moved rapidly west until obscured by what seemed to be clouds. Residing only 40 miles from an international airport, 15 miles from 2 municipal airports and 3 hospital heliports and at least 2 private airfields, during my past 25 years I have witnessed a number of varying aircraft servicing these facilities. The observation of 07/19/10 seems to be an anomaly from what I have previously observed. I have never seen a plane, helicopter, or other flying object turn away at night and not have at least a tail beacon. These had nothing.;45.2707;-92.8301
