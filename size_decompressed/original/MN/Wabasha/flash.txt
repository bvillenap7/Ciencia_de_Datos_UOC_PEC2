The rate of speed and no sound;2000-08-22 21:45:00;15 sec;The rate of speed and no sound I just happen to step out last night to see what the weather was like, so as if we should open up the house.  I know it was over cast and I could hear a commercial air liner in the distance.  As I looked up I saw a bright flash, similar to a strobe light on an aircraft , what caught my attention , was the time and distance between flashes.  No plane I've ever seen could travel that fast between  flashes, and what was even more strange, there was no sound, absouletly none.  Like I said there was a distant  sound of a jet , and that was still heard after this object was long gone.  It  moved from the southeast toward the northwest,  like from Winona  MN to  Minneapolis  MN.   The total time I observed this object, couldn't  have been morre than  15 secs.   I know for sure I saw  3 flashes, then due to my location where I was standing, with trees and the house, buy the time I changed my stand for another view, it was gone.  It was overcast, and I'm not sure what the ceiling was,  but it's my  guess  it had to be less then 3000' and it definitely was under the overcast.;44.3721;-92.035
