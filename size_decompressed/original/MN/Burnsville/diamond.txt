In a clear sky, I saw one silver object glistening in the sunlight that looked diamond-shaped. It appeared to hover without any motion. I looked for blinking lights like on airplanes, but saw none. I was in Burnsville, MN looking at it in a southward sky. Since I was driving my car at the time, I couldn't stop to get further details. Telescopic instruments would've been helpful! =);44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
