Bright Orange sphere low altitude then disappeared;2012-08-31 21:30:00;1 minute;Bright Orange sphere low altitude then disappeared It was an orange sphere that was at a low altitude and flew right in front of an commercial Aircraft on descent.  We live by an Airport and know flight patterns and this was not on any flight pattern we've ever seen before.  I tried to get out my camera but before I could the orange light disappeared and it's been 35 minutes and still have seen any commercial flights in the sky!;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
Red spherical object seen moving against the breeze with white light on bottom.;2014-07-04 21:15:00;45 second;Red spherical object seen moving against the breeze with white light on bottom. Perhaps the best fireworks that I will see tonight.  At 21:15, 9:15 PM, driving home on county Road 11, above a hill at the highest point on my route north back home I saw a bright red light.  Originally with the air traffic from MSP I was expecting an aircraft of some sort. At about 130th street I was able to better make out the object and saw no other running lights, which aroused my interest.  The object was about the speed of a light plane and continued changing the observation angle to the point where I was directly under it. It was round with no appendages.  The outer edges of the object were a dark red and the object was an increasingly brighter red toward it's center.  There was a bright white light in the center which varied from very bright to much less so. I saw this object while I traveled 3/4 mile at 40 mph and it crossed from my right front to overhead and to my rear in that time.  It crossed my line of sight going into trees.  It was no higher than 500 feet in my estimation, steady in that elevation and by reconsidering my positions on a map it was traveling to the South-SouthWest, against the reported breeze from the South.  It was 5 to 8 feet in diameter if its elevation was 500 feet, proportionally greater if higher in elevation.  It was sharp and distinct when seen closer and especially when it was directly overhead.   Total time of the observation was about 45 seconds.  This was just after sunset with cloudy skies.  I had two cameras with me, shame on me for not stopping and trying to grab a picture, or two. Conventional explanation seems limited to a balloon flare but the object was going against a light, but prevailing breeze. With many people out on the Fourth looking at fireworks, some kind of balloon drone combination would have to be considered too. But that is if one needs to find a conventional explanation.;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
