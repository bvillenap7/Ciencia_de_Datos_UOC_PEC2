Triangle object object seen over burnsville 5:25 am;2010-10-22 05:25:00;10 min;Triangle object object seen over burnsville 5:25 am It was dark so I could not definitively determine the exact shape but as it passed over I saw an arrangement of lights that I have never seen befor on any known flying craft.  The yellow/orange lights were in the form of a triangle along the perimiter with a flashing red/white light center or closer to the trailing edge.  The craft was large and produced no sound.  Its direction was north east toward the mpls airport but then changed direction to north west toward plymouth.;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
