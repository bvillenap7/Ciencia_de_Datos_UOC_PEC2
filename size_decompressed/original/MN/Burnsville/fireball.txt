2 Fireballs Hovering Side by Side Moving Slowly then Vanished;2013-04-12 20:45:00;15 seconds;2 Fireballs Hovering Side by Side Moving Slowly then Vanished My girlfriend (at the time, now wife) and I decided to take a walk after dinner around Sunset Pond in Burnsville in the evening.  We finished our lap around the pond and decided to sit at the bench together and chat.   About 50 yards from us along the walking path, two fireballs about the size of a basketball appeared about 5 feet above ground and moved in sync together slowly parallel with the walking path for about 15 seconds.  No sound.  And then it vanished.   We were startled and immediately got in the car and left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
Green ball of light cruised across sky.;2013-11-15 17:15:00;5 seconds;Green ball of light cruised across sky I am a middle-aged professional male.  I was alone, so as far as I know, I was the only witness.   This sighting occurred while I was driving home from work this evening, at approximately 5:15pm.  I was traveling in a SW direction, and the light that I saw was traveling in about the same direction as I was.  My sunroof was open and I would say that I had about an 80 degree arc of sky that I could see.   What I saw was a distinctly green light.  It moved very fast.  Much faster than an airplane, but not so fast as a meteor streak off of the atmosphere.   The light was also relatively large.  I would say approximately 1/10 the size of the full moon at peak height.   The light moved from behind me to in front of me, across the full range of sky that I could see, in about 5 seconds.   It did not leave a trail of any kind.;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
green fireball falling from sky;2019-04-14 23:25:00;5 seconds;green fireball falling from sky While driving with my sister, heading north, we witnessed a ball of greenish white light hovering in the sky, far brighter and larger then an average star.   It then began to plummet eastward, starting on fire and leaving a tail of flames behind it in the sky.  We lost sight of it once it hit the tree line.;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
