The Mothership and its Orb;2012-11-04 20:30:00;Not sure;The Mothership and its Orb I went to let my dog out in the back yard as I was waiting I noticed an orb in the sky which seemed to be circling the area of my back yard but it was way up in the sky.  At first I thought it might be the spotlight from Mystic Lake, but I was wrong because it wasn't a beam of light it was an orb. I ran in the house to get my roomate to see and he said him and his friend seen the same thing a few nights ago.  Then he looked to the west and hovering just above the neighbors trees was a huge object which my roomate commented was the Mothership and thats exactly what it looked like.   The orb itself was a light white greenish color and round the &quotMothership&quot had faded lights all around it and a green hue behind it.  I have never seen anything so spectacular in my life!   We watch for about 10 mins and the orb just kept circling and the &quotMothership&quot just stayed hovering.  I went back out about an hour later and they were both gone---;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
Orange light moved effortlessly through cloudy night sky, flickered, and vanished.;2012-11-22 20:30:00;2 minutes;Orange light moved effortlessly through cloudy night sky, flickered, and vanished. I was in my backyard playing catch with my younger brother  Thanksgiving night, when a bright orange light in the sky caught my eye. It was a cloudy night, and I could see the difference of density as the light moved through them.   In the thin sections, the light didn't seem to emit any glare. It was as if I was looking into a source of light, rather than the having the light shine outward.  The movement was fluid and sporadic, unlike anything I've ever seen before.    After about 30 seconds of unearthly flight, it came to a hover.  I witnessed the light dim until it was barely in sight, then return to its original brilliance. It did this three or four more times, and then vanished. The event matched many encounters I've read about prior to witnessing one with my own eyes. Truly amazing.;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
Bright Star Like Shape with red and green blinking lights.;2014-04-10 23:58:00;15+ minutes;Bright Star Like Shape with red and green blinking lights. This could be nothing but I was looking out our large picture window at almost midnight of April 10, 2014.  I noticed what looked like a very bright star in the NE sky.   Then I noticed red and green blinking lights every so often so then I thought it must be a plane.  This object never moved, however just hung in the sky with intermittent blinking red and green lights ever so faint.   I watched this for about 15 minutes and this object moved very slightly left to right but usually settled back in its original spot.  I can only think satellite or weather balloon, but truly have no idea.   I blinked my eyes many times and looked away from this object to make sure I was not imagining anything.  Looking at the stars in the sky, they were much fainter and certainly did not have green and red lights flashing.   I thought maybe it was an illusion of clouds dancing off the bright star, but the other stars did not have any clouds affecting them nearby, so that theory was shot.   Again, I do not know what it was and maybe it was a satellite or weather balloon, but I felt it worth reporting.;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917

It was silent and was slowly moving to th south east.  The low cloud cover did not allow for any other detail than the circle of lights.   She said it was quite large.;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
Bright white circle/orb moving at a 90-degree angle from up to down.;2019-01-16 02:00:00;3 seconds;Bright white circle/orb moving at a 90-degree angle from up to down. While driving East on County Rd. 42, I witnessed a bright white circle shoot down at approximately a 90-degree angle oriented behind the Fairview Ridges Hospital.   The object left no trail and was larger than what could be interpreted as a shooting star or any other celestial body.;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917

The event lasted at least 5 minutes while I was traveling in the same direction.;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
