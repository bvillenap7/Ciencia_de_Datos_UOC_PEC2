50 silver irridescent diamond shaped objects in the formation of a wide awkward heart that blinked in and out of view in MN;2006-04-10 13:45:00;1 minute;50 silver irridescent diamond shaped objects in the formation of a wide awkward heart that blinked in and out of view in MN I was driving in my car down 35E going towards the Twin Cities and I saw many silver irredescent-like, almost diamond shaped objects high in the sky that were clustered in a formation that almost looked like a very wide awkward heart.  They looked like they were not moving, except for the fact that they were blinking in and out of view.  A comparison that I could make is that of the scene in the movie Superman when the bad guys were floating in space in aa flat glass that was spinning --only in this case when they looked like they would start to spin or flutter they would disapear in thin air-all of them at once.  Then they reappeared in the exact same formation, looking exactly the same and would flicker for about 10 seconds-until they disapeared again.  This flickering in and out happened about 4 or 5 times--then I didnt see them again. It was a clear day-only a few clouds in the sky--and they were so clear and so precise in its repeating formation.   My background-is Im a 29 year old female. Im in college studying Sociology and Physics, and I have two young kids.  At the time it was happening --I called my boyfriend Marcus and was explaining to him what I was seeing.  There were other drivers on the road that seemed oblivious to what I was seeing--but I KNOW IT WAS REAL.  I dont know what on this planet would do that and act like it did--I have never seen anything like it in my life!!;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
