Hovering Object Near Cliff Rd/Portland Ave S;2011-09-24 22:00:00;15 min;Hovering Object Near Cliff Rd/Portland Ave S I was traveling into work a little before 10pm and exited 35W onto Cliff Rd traveling east in Burnsville.  Up ahead over the tree line I saw what looked like a falling star, only it was a blue ball falling towards the ground in a zig-zag motion.  It fell out of my sight.  I went around an S curve in the road and then was heading east again up the hill.  After I rounded the curve the object was again in my site, directly up ahead.  As I drove closer (less than a mile from where I initially saw it) I could see it more clearly.  I could see that it was moving slowly approximately 500-1000ft in the air.  As I got to the top of the hill near the intersection of Cliff Rd and 12th Ave. S, the object was very close, to the north and almost directly above me.  I slowed down (there were no other cars around), I rolled my window down to get a better look.  The object had a bright white light, and also a green and red light depending on which way it faced.  At the top! of the hill I turned left onto 12th Ave S. and could still see the object to the west of me, still very close, moving very slowly or possibly stationary.  About a minute later I arrived at work and got another coworker to come outside.  We both watched the object in the same location for several minutes before going back inside.  There is an Xcel Energy plant directly below where I believe the object was hovering.  The object was moving very slowly and occasionally in a hovering circular motion.  There was no sound detected.  A third co-worker also saw the object on his way in at the same time.  We went back out about 15 minutes later and the object was gone.;44.7527240601505;-93.282006766917
