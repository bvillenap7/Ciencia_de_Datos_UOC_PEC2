I saw something with lights lifting up into the air down by a neighboring farm.  About half a mile away.  Was huge and round.   It came towards our home.  By the time it reached our home there was total silence.  It hovered right above where I was looking out my door.  Lights were all lit up around it.  No sound at all.   The next thing I remember is it flying off and getting very loud the further away it got. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
