Saucer-shaped UFO caught on video in the western skies of Bemidji, MN.;2014-03-23 10:00:00;0.33 second;Saucer-shaped UFO caught on video in the western skies of Bemidji, MN. On the morning of 3/23/14 at an estimated time of 1000 hrs, I set my video camera outside on my small deck, facing due west, and began recording.  I then reviewed the full 29 minutes at regular speed however, 20 minutes into it, I notice a flash of light so, I took it back slightly and slowed the speed down to .125 of full speed.  It was at that point when I noticed what appeared to be a silver or grey saucer-shaped object flying from the top right of my screen, and going left (with a slight downward angle), then swooped upward @ about a 45o angle. Upon review, I realized that this COULD NOT be one of ours as this traveled at least 1/2 of a mile or more in a matter of .33 seconds and that would put it at well over Mach 1 speed. The craft was very far away, and was filmed with my Nikon CoolPix L120 video camera/camera.  I have the original Sand Disk, and am more than happy to provide any information or materials you might need with regard to investigating this sighting. I've reached out to a local station (Fox 9), out of Minneapolis and they have yet to return my call as promised.  I was told of your site hence, my contacting you today, instead of the same day of the sighting. Thank you for your time, and I will look forward to your return call.
