She also saw the red ball heading east but just after she was able to get a real good look, the object went away out of vew.  The red light was not blinking or flashing so i just cant figure out what it was.  All my life iv wanted to see a ufo, i cant say this was but i do know iv never seen anything like that before.;47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
