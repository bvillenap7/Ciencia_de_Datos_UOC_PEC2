White cigar shaped object disappears in front of our eyes;2014-03-24 19:40:00;4;White cigar shaped object disappears in front of our eyes. Driving north on highway 89 in northern Minnesota from Bemidji to Red Lake.  Saw a white cigar shaped light in sky for approx 330-54minutes.  It was flying upward at a slanted angle.  We thought it was a jet.  As we kept driving some trees along the highway blocked our view for about 3 seconds and when the sky cleared the object was completely gone!   No jet fuel trails, no plane, no sound...nothing.   Please note the sky had no clouds in it. ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to telephone the witness, on several occasions, but no one answers the phone.  The witness did not provide a valid e-address.  We cannot certify that this is a serious-minded report.  PD));47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
