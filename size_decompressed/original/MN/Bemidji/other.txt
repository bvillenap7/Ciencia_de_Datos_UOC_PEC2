Then about 5-10 seconds later we saw a satellite the over the next 2 minutes we saw 4 four more satellites.  We know this wasn't a satellite or some type of plane because it didn't have any blinking light or red and blue;47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
4 separate crafts spotted, w/ 1st a cigar or cylindrical in shape, then a dark craft.  ((NUFORC Note:  Birds or insects?  PD));2012-04-15 10:00:00;7 minutes;There are 4 separate crafts spotted with the first being &quotcigar or cylindrical&quot in shape, followed by a dark craft, and 2 sa On 041014, I set my video camera up on a tripod, and faced it directly into the sky at a 90 degree angle.  This ran for 29 minutes and at approximately 22 minutes into video, I'd noticed a dark object flash across the screen(which would have it coming from west, and moving east with a slight turn north).  Upon noticing this dark craft I backed the video up so as to observe said object at a slower speed and slowed the speed to 1/8 of full speed.  Upon review, I'd picked up a cylindrical or cigar-shaped object, with a light white color moving VERY fast coming from the west, and moving towards the east/northeast then noticed the darker craft(which had an appearance like that of the Baltic Sea find). Don't know how else to describe this craft. This was the ONLY craft that could be seen at full speed...fyi.  When this craft came into the picture from the bottom of screen(from the west), I could tell that it did a death roll and twisted from left to right, then shot slightly further right then the cigar-shaped object.  Moving forward at the slowed speed of 1/8th normal speed, There appeared to the left of my screen( from the west) 2 objects which seemed to be higher in elevation, and possible saucer-shaped.! Unsure, due to size by appearance.  These two crafts also were not able to be seen at full speed.;47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
