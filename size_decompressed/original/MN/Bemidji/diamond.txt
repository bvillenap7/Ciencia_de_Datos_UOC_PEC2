One large object, one small object, orange green yellow and blue lights.;2013-12-11 03:00:00;15 minutes;One large object, one small object, orange green yellow and blue lights. Around 1:30 am my husband and I went outside for a cigarette. I noticed the extra bright spot that I see in the sky every single night, but tonight with the frigid, clear conditions, you could see a distinct diamond shape that was blinking green, yellow and blue. Around 3:00 am I went outside alone.  The object was on the other side of the sky, and when focusing on the object I noticed not only that it was blinking green, yellow and blue but that it seemed to be bobbing up and down.  While staring at this object, I noticed another, smaller and less distinct light that seemed to be traveling and closing the gap between itself and the large, bright object.  While I was watching, the larger object seemed to flash orange and both objects ceased all movement. I went back inside and returned about an hour later, knowing that the objects would be gone. The only apparent object in the sky was the one that I normally see in its usual spot, so the large and bright object was back where I normally see it, but much less brighter than in the previous hour. It was still brighter than any star near it, and it continued to bob, though not as much as before.The second, smaller object was no where to be seen.
