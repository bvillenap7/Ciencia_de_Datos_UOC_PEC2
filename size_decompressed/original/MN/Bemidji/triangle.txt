Triangular shaped object seen over rural road;1985-06-01 18:00:00;5 seconds;Triangular shaped object seen over rural road While driving home with my mother on a rural road I saw a very low flying object cross our path traveling northwest.  The object had bright green, red and I think white lights and appeared to be triangular or boomerang shaped.  It appeared to be moving slower than a plane would be flying and it wasn't loud like a low flying plane or jet usually is. In fact I don't remember it making any noise at all.  It flew almost directly over our car and I lost site of it as it moved over trees on the other side of the road.  I asked my mother if she saw it and she said she did.  I then asked if it was a plane and she said she didn't know.  We continued home and did not really speak of the incident again.

In october 1997 my dad and I seen 3 lights in the shape of a triangle tumbling over each other in Bemidji Minnesota.;1997-10-01 00:00:00;10 Minutes;In october 1997 my dad and I seen 3 lights in the shape of a triangle tumbling over each other in Bemidji Minnesota. My dad and I were heading up north to go hunting. We were just outside city limits of Bemidji Minnesota traveling north on Hwy 89. We noticed a weird set of lights over a field, but since we only make it up that way about twice a year, we figured it may be a new radio tower or some form of tower that had been errected since we last passed through. As we got closer to where the tower should have been our conversation changed from hunting to what that could be in the sky. we came to a point where we were directly across from it. It was a clear night and there was no structure reaching to the sky, just 3 lights hovering above the ground. The lights were in the form of a triangle, and were all white. The reminded me of club lights, because they were tumbling. They never left the shape of a triangle, but they were tumbling, as if spinning from top to bottom. Like if you were to take a popcan and make it tumble top to bottom, from end to end. What was really cool about that is that when the lights would tumble they were as if there was a... that's it, a better description would be a light house. There would be a beam of light that would shine out and then it would be more soft, then beam of light. It's been a while I can't recall if they all tumbled in unisyn, or if they tumbled independent of each other. The craft itself you could not see, but you could see that there were 3 distinct points on it. It was like a triangle, or a flying pryamid. We had pulled over to the side of the road, and watched this thing for about 10 minutes. Two cars passed us by and we waved to them and pointed to the sky in the direction of the object. The cars hit their break lights as they passed, but continued on their way. After 10 minutes the object slowly started to move to the south, then in a blink of an eye it was like a distant star. It just took off. It was amazing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
Black, triangle, split into 4 smaller triangles, speed/shape of normal aeroplane.;2001-12-08 14:32:00;6 minutes;Black, triangle, split into 4 smaller triangles, speed/shape of normal aeroplane. I was checkin my email when i saw a large triangle outside my window. It was black, and about the size of an average aeroplane. I moved about the speed of an aeroplane, and then stopped and split  into 2 smaller black triangles. They each sped off in a different direction. It made no sound.;47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
Did anyone see the Triangle with lights in the sky in Bemidji, March 1, 2011 at 7:55?;2011-03-01 07:00:00;4 minutes;Did anyone see the Triangle with lights in the sky in Bemidji, March 1, 2011 at 7:55? I was traveling from Hwy 2 into bemidji, North onto Paul Bunyan Drive.  One mile before the Northwest Tech college, I spotted a bright light in the sky to the left.  It appeared to be a street light, but as I came closer, I thought maybe its on top of a water tower.  Quickly, I remebered there is no water tower at this end of the city. I was talking on my cell phone at the time.  As I got closer I could see, it was a triangle shape with three bright lights.  It looked suspended in the sky. I was telling the person I was talking to on the phone the description.  I opened my window because I thought maybe this is a new Helicopter of sorts.  However, I didn't hear any noise that accompanies a helicopter. I was close enough to hear any noise.  I could see it, and it was not a Helicopter.  I remembered I had a camera in my purse. I was reaching for it and I pulled over to the shoulder of the road, which was not a good idea because someone could have crashed into me.  As I reached for the camera, the lights changed to a dim yellow and turned directions slowly south. I can't believe I'm the only one that saw this thing. I wonder if people even notice the sky at night? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
Illuminated orange trianglular object moving with purpose.;2014-06-16 23:30:00;~4 minutes;Illuminated orange trianglular object moving with purpose. I took the dogs for a final stroll before bed.  Live in a rural area in the woods.  Walking back toward the house I noticed a movement in the sky above the tree tops & the roof, moving east to west.  Very much exactly east to west.  My initial glance looked like a red/orange ball moving steadily but tree tops made viewing somewhat unclear.  I backed back down the driveway (it is on a hill), to get a better view.  Realized it was nothing familiar so ran into the house and told my sister to get onto the deck quickly to see this thing.  She has good distance vision, I am near sighted. We moved to the deck on the lake side of the house where we could still see it as it moved away from us to the west over the lake.  My sister immediately said that it was triangular and that the orange lights almost looked like fluorescent tube lights around the edges.  It just continued moving at the same pace and with the same trajectory.  Not a sound was heard and it was a quiet, still night. We have tried to estimate the altitude of whatever it was and can only say with certainty that it was low enough for her to be able to see some detail, no where near the altitude of the typical jets we occasionally see overhead.  It was in no danger of hitting tree tops or even cell towers but still close enough to see well. We have not heard of anyone else reporting this object however, I know people are outside @ night and I am certain that other people would have seen it.  The thing was very bright orange and looked very large going across the sky. I did not take the time to find cameras.  It all happened so fast and we didn't want to forego seeing the object in order to find electronics.  Just wasn't prepared @ the time.  Lesson learned.....;47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
