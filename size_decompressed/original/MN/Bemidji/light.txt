He came inside and got me and told me to grab my camera.  I snapped 2 pictures before I started filming.   By that time the balls of light we're going behind the clouds.  They were shaped like Orion's Belt.   One moved back and forth while the others moved straight ahead.   The balls of light were a bright orange/red color and very bright.;47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
Fast, bright moving object in Northern Minnesota;2016-08-06 22:00:00;3 minutes;Fast, bright moving object in Northern Minnesota On August 6, 2016, at approximately 2200 hours, my wife and I were on our rear house deck, which is facing north towards the woods, when I observed an object moving across the sky quickly.  I pointed the object out to my wife and she asked what it was.   We live in a very rural wooded area and it was quiet, the object made no noise and there was no flashing lights common with aircraft in the night sky.   I told my wife that I thought it might be a satellite, but it was going way too fast and too low in the night sky.  The object was moving quickly from West to East horizon.   Object did not make any noise or any other light other than the bright yellow/orange it emitted.;47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
Beams of light at approx 200 ft;2018-05-15 22:00:00;20 minutes;Beams of light at approx 200 ft On May 15, 2018, at 10:30 pm I was driving from Bemidji, MN, to Grand Rapids, MN, on Hwy 2.  There were scattered clouds with mostly clear skies.  The stars were beautiful that night. As I was driving I saw what I thought was a falling star than I saw a second.  These were not falling stars as they were too low on the sky.  My estimate would be only a few hundred feet at most.  They were not heat lightening as their quality was of a search light beam.   I slowed the car down to look for a source but saw nothing attached to the lights.  I drove home wondering what they could have been.   The next day I was telling my sister what I saw and she said she saw them too.  I was driving through heavy forested land with no towns near by & my sister saw them 50 miles away so they weren't flood lights from a car dealership either.  I wonder if anyone else saw them.

Zig-zagging light moving at alternating velocities.;2020-03-20 20:40:00;2 minutes;Zig-zagging light moving at alternating velocities. White light at an apparent high altitude moving west to east, alternately slower then faster while zig-zagging side to side along its path.  Luminosity and color was similar to background stars but slowly dimmed and changed to dull orange and faded out of sight as it passed beyond the treeline.  Resembled an ordinary satellite except for its striking occillating movement and unsteady speed.;47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
