Large bright orange object moving slowing and quietly and then faded into the sky.;2008-07-03 21:30:00;2 minutes;Large bright orange object moving slowing and quietly and then faded into the sky. We were sitting outside and it was almost dark.  Coming from the west was a very bright orange light that was much larger than a plane light. We almost thought it was a plane on fire that was going to crash. When it went over us it looked like a light that was part of the craft was moving from left to right back and forth (like a search light). Then we knew it was not a plane because there was no sound and the light was too big and bright. Then about 45 minutes later we saw it again coming from the west, then stopped in the sky turned toward the North and disappeared.  It faded right in the sky.;47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
Flaming Orb in Chippewa National Forest;2010-11-24 20:00:00;About 1 to 2 minutes;Flaming Orb in Chippewa National Forest I live in rural Northern Minnesota. Near around what I presume to be 8:00 p.m. on 11-24-10 driving home in a blizzard in the Chippewa National Forest I saw a flaming fireball in the sky.  At first it was distant and flickering.  And as it got closer it looked like a flame, not a sharp acute flame but more like a candle.  This had what seemed to be a spherical shell around it, like a translucent halo. It moved in a very slow almost ballon type way. I had to stop my vehicle on the side of the road and watch it.  It came down to what seemed to be very close, but there was no way of judging size, because it was night, and a blizzard making visabilty poor as well.  But I know what I saw was not a civilian aircraft, it had no directional lights of any kind, and the conditions were so poor the Emergency Helicopter base was shut down for the night.  When I shut the vehicle off and rolled down the windows, I heard no sound, it actually floated over toward me, (or what I pr! esume was toward me it was hard to tell), in this odd bobbing fashion.  It then gained altitude slowly and disapeared into the snow filled, North-Western night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Fireball red circle that hovers in sky NW between Bemidji and Red Lake.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2012-04-17 00:00:00;15 minutes;Fireball red circle that hovers in sky NW Between Bemidji and Red Lake My boyfriend and I have witnessed a fireball like object 6 times since February.  It is always in the same general area/direction NW from where we live.  It appears to hover not still like a star, and from where we see it is way above the tree line in the sky.  It is always a reddish color but it seems to flicker or change to reddish orange and white lights. It's usually seen late at night from 10pm-12am and it only lasts about 15 minutes at the most and then disappears . We plan on continuing to look for it and next time documenting it on camera.

Ball of colored light shoots across Bemidji sky;2012-05-12 01:00:00;3 seconds;ball of colored light shoots across Bemidji sky Some time after 1am, a group of about 8 adults were gathered around a campfire in the back yard.  I was one of 3 people who were grouped together to have a picture taken,  and the rest of the group were sitting in a circle around the fire.  Movement in the sky caught my eye and I looked up to see what it was.  A bright greenish blue ball of light with an orange colored tail was shooting across the sky.  I shouted &quotLook! look! look!&quot and each member of the group followed where I was looking.  We all watched as this object shot across the sky and out of our direct view in an East to West direction. I will attempt to put it into perspective.  As I am looking out at the Southern sky, picture it as the top half of a clock (9 to 3).  The view of the first 1/3 of the sky is obscured by a garage and trees.  The object comes into view for me at about 11 o'clock and travels across the sky and is out of view by 2 o'clock. The object made no sound.  This whole encounter lasted only about 3 seconds. I recall having the time and foresight to call out &quottake a picture&quot as the object is at about the 1 o'clock position, but the photographer is so mesmerized and shocked that she was unable to get a picture taken. We discuss and verify what we each saw.  Later, another couple came to the house.  We tell them what we saw and they both verify seeing the same thing from where they were in downtown Bemidji.  Their description was very similar to what we described and they were about 3-4 miles South of where we were. Trying to put the size of the object into perspective is difficult.  Two different groups described very similar objects yet were 4 miles apart.  So the object had to be quite large and quite far away.  Yet the object still looked quite large in the sky.  In comparing the size of a star or the moon as one looks up into the sky, I would have to describe the object as being about 1/4 the size of the moon. So besides the obvious, out of the ordinary color, this object was large enough to not mistake it for a shooting star.  I thought of a meteor because the orange colored tail made me think it would be hot, but it seemed to be maintaining its altitude as it shot across the sky, and not in a downward trajectory.;47.5466675925926;-94.8125583333334
