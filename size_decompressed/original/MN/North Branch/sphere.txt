We decided to stop at my folks place on South Chain Lake.  It was around 11:15pm or so.  The weather was windy and cold with some light snow.   My folks were out of town so I was checking in on the house periodically.  My fiancé wanted to check the baseball scores so he went downstairs to use the computer.  I was upstairs making a late-night snack in the kitchen.  About that time I was startled by bright lights in the backyard towards the lake. It was so bright I thought a helicopter was shining lights down but there was no noise.  The brightness quickly reduced and turned into a blue-hued light shining into the house. At this point I fainted and my fiancé, Dwight, heard me hit the floor. He came running upstairs to find me lying on my side by the sliding glass door (I must have gone over to look out the window).  He says he saw no lights and nothing outside.  We went outside and there were two parallel tracks coming up from lake shore to the middle of yard, almost like car tracks but they were smooth.  The odd thing is I seemed to have no injury from when I fainted, and this all seemed to take place in under a minute, but Dwight swears he was on computer for 10 or more minutes.  I felt I had to tell my story somewhere.  I never really believed in UFO’s previously, but I’ve been having nightmares about it for 5 days now and have had a couple of flashbacks. Also, my dreams include seeing a hovering globe or sphere-shaped craft and I feel weightless, like I'm always falling.;45.5116;-92.9816
