Stationary lights southwest of North Branch, MN.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2015-03-10 00:24:00;10 minutes;Stationary lights southwest of North Branch, MN. My younger sister was in her room and noticed what looked like the lights of an airplane out the window, to the southwest, through a crack in her curtains.  Given the small area for her to see the lights, she began to doubt it was from an airplane as they remained stationary, so she and my other sister went outside to see if they could get a better look.   There was no sound to be heard, so they decided it wasnâ€™t a helicopter either.  As they continued to watch, the lights grew dimmer and disappeared.
