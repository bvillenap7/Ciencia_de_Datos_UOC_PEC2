That thing was not built around here;1978-11-21 23:45:00;5 minutes;That thing was not built around here I worked 2nd. shift at F.M.C. Fridley, Mn. as a machinest.  I lived in North Branch, Mn.  Going N. on I 35 on my way home I saw two very bright searchlights on the E. side of the highway about 5-10 miles south of N. Branch.  As I got closer I thought it was a hellicopter.  I did 4 years of active duty in the Navy, including a tour in Viet Nam as a fwd. gunner on a PBR (Patrol boat river)...I know and love hellicopters. My 1st. thought was a lost hunter being sought.  I slowed to a stop and pulled onto the shoulder of the road.  The craft was about 50 feet over the scruffty trees...there was snow on the ground.  I got out of my car and watched it angle toward me from the N.N.E then angle away to the S.E.  Speed about 30 mph.  It made no noise.  I could have hit it with a sling shot  Two spotlights on front slightly outboard of center, two clearance lights on outside, flat bottom.  Snow illuminated the underside, appeared to have hydraulic lines incorperated into it.  I would guess 50 ft. long ,20 ft.wide sillouette like a Ford Gt.40.  A large reddish ball in the rear.  I called the sheriffs dept. and asked if there were any sightings...from a pay phone..NO.  I did not persue this due to my job`s security clearance.
