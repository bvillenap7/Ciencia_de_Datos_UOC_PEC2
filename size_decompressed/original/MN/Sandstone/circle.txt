It was not very high above the ground and I was able to watch it for about 1 and a 1/2 minutes.  The night was so clear and still you could hear a mouse in the woods at 100 yards away. The milky way was as bright as it gets.  This object made NO sound and kinda jerked as it moved in a straight path heading North East. The object was brighter than anything in the sky by far & had a red glow with a very different look that I had never seen before. Its been 5 days now and I felt I should file a repost to see if anyone else had seen the same thing.  I am 41 years old and have had my own contracting business for over 18 years. I have been married for 15 years with 2 children.;46.1363;-92.5892
