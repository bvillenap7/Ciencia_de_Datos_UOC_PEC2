I saw a light in the sky that disappeared in front of my eye.;2001-08-01 16:30:00;2min. or so;I saw a light in the sky that disappeared in front of my eye. I was driving north on hwy 123 in Minnesota (Pine co). When I approached Co.road 23, to my amazement off to my left at about 11:00 o'clock, I noticed a cigar shaped light which was hovering at approx. 100 feet from the ground. I thought, that's strange, no pole which the light was attached. I stopped, rolled down my window, and I heard no noise from the object. At that very moment, one half of the lights went out, and the other half went out slowly one after the other. At that point, I became extremely frighten, because whatever I had just witnessed had disappeared in front of my eyes with no logical explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
