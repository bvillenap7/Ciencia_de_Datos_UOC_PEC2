Greenish white light metalic object swaying in sky.;2013-09-22 02:00:00;45 minutes;Greenish white light metalic object swaying in sky. At 2:00AM on 9/22/2013 I stepped outside my front door facing Southwest and sat on my steps to have a cigarette.  After I lit my cigarette and put my lighter down I looked up int the sky as I do every night.  I noticed a large greenish white light out in the distance over the trees about 1/2 mile.  This light object also appeared to have a metalic look to it as well as a greenish white glowing light.  It swayed and hovered and pulsated while slowly moving in a circular motion after swaying.  It continued to move higher in the sky over a range of ten minutes.  I also noticed an airplane about 5 miles away with its blue lights heading toward the Duluth Airport a this time as I am looking at this strange object glowing greenish white and no sound. I go outside several times in the AM due to chronic pain and to have a smoke.  I have never seen this light greenish white metalic glowing object before this night.   The sky was clear 100%.
