August 7, 2015, the time 11:45 pm.   Looking in the west northwest direction towards Waite Park, from Sauk Rapids.  Altitude was going by the stars.  It was same height as the lowest star in the sky . OK, my best description.  Me and few friends were sitting outside in his garage.  Enjoying the night getting ready to go home.  When I looked up which is normal I always watch the sky.  When all the sudden I seen a bright glow.  Its color was a blue silver start to appear . In comparison lets say it started from nothing there to golf ball size.  Then continued to grow.  I said my friend hey what look.  And pointed right away he says ufo.   We never have discussed between each other about our feelings of UFOs so I said u think? He says I don't know.  At this point it has grown to the largest thing in the sky.  I will compare it to a large beach ball.  The whole time this is happening it looked stationary . While it formed to its beach ball size. The total amount of time was 45 seconds to maybe 1 minute and 15 seconds.  Then faded in size and brightness to a very dim glow.  My kids said they could still see it I couldn't . And my buddy said he could barely see it.  That's when it started to move north . In reference to the Mississippi River.  My buddy is a computer security programmer.  Respectable, trustworthy guy.  I told my girlfriend who didn't see it but was there.  And she said that's the same area her and her sister had seen the same thing.  And it did the whole bright small to large thing about.;45.6036;-94.1615000000001
