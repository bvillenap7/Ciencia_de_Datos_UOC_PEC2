Honestly a little scared!  I just got home from my daughters hockey game went out back to check on things, its quiet, look up and here it is silently floating across the sky until it faded in to the trees in my back yard and I lost it.  I live near a small airport but not a lot of over night traffic, oh it is or was also a blackhawk base or repair site.;45.6036;-94.1615000000001
