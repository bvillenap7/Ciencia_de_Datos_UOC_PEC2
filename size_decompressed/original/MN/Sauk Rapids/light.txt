I saw about 30 satellites moving in single file, straight line trajectory, constant speed, spaced evenly.  ((Spacelink satellites)).;2020-03-07 20:00:00;10 minutes;I saw about 30 satellites moving in single file, straight line trajectory, constant speed, spaced evenly apart First, let me say that I have never seen a ufo, and I believe that what I saw was satellites. I was offloading or delivering gasoline to a station in sauk rapids, mn.  I was actually daydreaming about seeing a UFO,  when I looked up into the night sky I say a small white light moving at constant speed, and in linear trajectory, in a northernly direction (approximately).  It was at very high altitude.  As I watched it I noticed it had a second one about 4 seconds behind it.  As I continued to watch this, I noticed that there was a continuous stream of these objects (satellites).  Over the course of several minutes,  I counted about 30 of these objects.  I've never seen this many satellites moving together in a straight line, and I considered this to be noteworthy (hence this report);45.6036;-94.1615000000001
Bright light moved across the Northern sky and suddenly dissappeared;2020-11-23 18:12:00;15 seconds;Bright light moved across the Northern sky and suddenly dissappeared My dog (Shih Tzu mix) is on a very strict schedule. He usually doesn’t go outside until 9 PM CST every night like clockwork, but on Monday, November 23rd he demanded to go outside at 6:12 PM. I was admiring how clear of a night it was and looked Northeast towards Cassiopeia, and saw a bright light moving across the constellation. I first thought it was a plane, but planes don’t typically look like a bright star, and planes usually move in one straight line. This light moved fast, but there was a slight wiggle to the line it moved in. It moved in this wiggly line for about 15 seconds, before looking like it was absorbed or swallowed by the sky. Another thing that doesn’t usually happen to planes. My dog had a case of the zoomies (hyperactivity) when I was watching the object. Which is odd for my super mellow older small dog. Growing up in the country, I’m no stranger to stargazing and have never seen anything like it in my life. I immediately walked into the house and told my fiancé what had happened I was so shocked. I wasn’t expecting my dog’s spontaneous potty break to be so eventful. I'm glad it happened when it did. I went out to get the mail 20 minutes later and the sky had completely clouded over.;45.6036;-94.1615000000001
