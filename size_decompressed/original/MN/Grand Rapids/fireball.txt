Four fireball spheres drift across horizon;2008-07-26 21:55:00;1 min 40 sec;Four fireball spheres drift across horizon Four fireball colored/shaped spheres drifted across the immediate horizon.  moving north to east, the spheres were in a semi-geometrical pattern shaped like a check mark.  The farthest fireball to the east appeared smaller than the nearest sphere towards the north--the pattern repeats    in respect to the other two fireballs to the north.  As the drifted away into the darkness, the first and second northern most fireballs arranged themselves so that if a  straight line was draw up, both fireballs would have landed on this line.  After a few more seconds all of the fireballs were out of eye site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));47.2316765625;-93.514840625
