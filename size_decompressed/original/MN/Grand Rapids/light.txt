A line of lights traveling across the sky from SW-NE.   ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-01 20:15:00;15 minutes;A line of lights traveling across the sky from SW-NE. I was outside at work looking at the night sky. Was focused on the Big Dipper. That’s when I saw the line of lights stretching across the sky. I called out my other coworkers to come out and see it. We didn’t know what we were looking at.  I counted roughly 27. They we’re all traveling the same speed in a formal line from Southwest to Northeast part of the sky.;47.2316765625;-93.514840625
UFO allowed my awareness of its presence known for the second night this week.;2021-05-28 09:45:00;50 seconds;UFO allowed my awareness of its presence known for the second night this week. My boyfriend and I had witnessed strange lights in a report I submitted couple nights prior and when we arrived home after a stop into town we vear off onto the right side of our dirt road in front of our house and shut ignition/lights off and finished up our conversation before going inside. Looking at him I noticed a very soft colored orange light to the left in the sky flying at a unusual speed unlike anything we are aware of that we intentionally have in the skies quickly without moving for fear that it will notice I notice it I tell my boyfriend “please look!” It wasn’t hard to find especially because it was fast and low. Just as he noticed it we both watch it drop another smaller sized light or lighted object from underneath itself and it faded/disappeared with almost a sparkler light trailing behind the fall only to just not be seen anymore and when I wasn’t distracted by that I look around for the ufo that it fell from and it was gone. Immediately open my door with fear I didn’t understand and a rush came over me when I saw another light of same color not in motion right above me lower then the first one and I quickly got into my house 25 ft away. I know there isn’t a definitive definition for this because we don’t even know how to communicate with whatever this is. Or maybe...I just know I saw something very real and took the time to let everyone else know and of all the moments I’ve faced when I look up into dark this week isn’t gunna help understand why I saw it.;47.2316765625;-93.514840625
