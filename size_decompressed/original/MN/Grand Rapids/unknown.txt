Too bright for this earth.;1998-05-10 19:00:00;10 Seconds;Too bright for this earth. Against a black sky, an extremly bright light was seen.  It was too bright to be a helicopter or airplane, and was too high to be a radio tower (also there are no towers in this area).  The light wasn't moving, I turned away for less than a second, when I looked back, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));47.2316765625;-93.514840625
