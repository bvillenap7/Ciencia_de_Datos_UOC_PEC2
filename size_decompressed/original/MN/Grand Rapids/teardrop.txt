We see ufo' quite often up here and have several videos.  One time lately a round orangish fire came onto our lake from the west.....stopped for a few seconds as we video taped it and then went north! ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated by witness is flawed.  June has only 30 days.  Possible hoax.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.2316765625;-93.514840625
