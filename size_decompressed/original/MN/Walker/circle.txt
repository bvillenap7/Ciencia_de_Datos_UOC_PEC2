At 3:00 in the morning on 5/17/06 I woke up to a bright light in the sky. I first thought that it was a star/planet. But the light was SO bright and started moving side to side at first then up and down. Not far apart but close proximity of the area.  I woke up my husband and we went out side to look at it.  He thougt it was a star but quickly realized IT was moving the other stars were not. This was quite an amazing event we've never seen anything like it.  I would love someone to explain this to me.  We are both small business owner's in a small town in Northern Minnesota, this was amazing.;47.0914;-94.5917
