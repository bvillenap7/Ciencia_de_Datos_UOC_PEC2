UFO hovering over Sherburne- more than 3 hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of 5 planets in eastern a.m. sky?  PD));2016-01-19 05:30:00;3 hours +;UFO hovering over Sherburne- more than 3 hours Woke up to go to bathroom in middle of night- approximately 5:30 am as I layed back down I was looking out the window and saw a bright light appear quickly over the neighboring tree line.  It was in a distance but I sat and watched it for 10 minutes - at first it was stationary but as I lined it up with the grid in the window I could measure its slight change of movement.   I asked my husband to look at it and he said at first glance that it was a star.  Then as he watched longer he saw it move.  He got the binoculars and said Wow- you got to see this!  It has five lights on it and it is hovering.  It had five lights in a row with the middle light being the largest  the lights changed colors from yellow green to red blue.  It looked really large way larger than a small airplane.   It hovered at a lower altitude until daybreak then it ascended higher into the sky.  It clearly looked like a star with the naked eye as it got higher in the sky.  It appeared that  the daybreak was what drove it higher in the sky.  We saw it make movements directly up - then quickly shifting side to side them down - it was really high in the sky still at 9:00 am but then cloud cover came and could not view it under the clouds anymore.  Really strange - it truly looked like in the alien movies - just like those spaceships with the lights.  We have never seen anything like this before!!   We will be watching the sky from now on.  So wierd to see something like this!! ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of 5 planets in eastern a.m. sky?  PD));45.6934;-93.9144
