strange bright light fades away;1997-09-15 22:00:00;5 min;strange bright light fades away it was night a number of years ago I was at a friend of my dad's farm helping my dad unload a trailor.  I noticed a very bright light off in the distance that was moving very fast moving in southernly direction(no aircraft that fly that low can go that fast). I watched it move for a min or 2 then had to look away for a moment to help my dad with something (he was to busy with what he was doing to pay attention).  when I looked back it had turned an exact 90 degrees and was heading west.  I continued to watch it move for another min or so until it STOPPED moving (didn't slow down... just stopped).  the bright light then bobbed a few times then faded out. sorry I can't even remember the exact year because it has been too long... 96-98 probably ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have arbitrarily assigned a date so that the report sorts to 1997.  PD));45.6934;-93.9144
