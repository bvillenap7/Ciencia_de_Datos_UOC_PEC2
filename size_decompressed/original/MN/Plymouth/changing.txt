As we were driving seen 2 objects in the sky. One has really bright lights. We seen and and as it was moving closer it started dropping at rapid speed. We thought it was a meteor until we notice as it was falling it shot across the sky. Then I followed the light and it looked like another light that it connected with and I thought the 2 lights were gonna collide and then they came together and stared flying parallel with each other and disappeared. The objects moved so fast I never seen anything like it. The light was so bright. The movement  was too fast and nothing like a plane. There was a total of 3 objects.;45.0192;-93.4311285714286
