At approximately 12:00pm, my mother and I were driving to have lunch at Rock Elm Creek in Plymouth, MN, out on their patio.  I was driving, my mother was in the passenger seat and my dog was in the back seat of my Prius.  It was a beautiful day clear skies and mid-60s.  I was driving east on Hwy 55 when all of sudden my attention was drawn to the sky to an unidentified flying object heading east.  I could not take my eyes off of it and kept asking my mom if she could see it.  I kept repeating that it has to be a UFO.  It was not very obvious in the sky.  It appeared disc to round shaped and appeared to be moving very fast eastward.  Every few seconds I could see the right side of the craft like it was maybe tilting some and could appreciate a metallic/silver color – it wasn’t consistent.  My mother finally saw the object before I had to turn and agreed it was unusual and remarked it must’ve been a drone.  I was quite astonished by it and if it was a drone I’m impressed how quickly they move (almost like gliding across the sky).  I’d never seen anything like it.  Just thought I should report it in case anybody else makes a similar report.   This is a quick report as I am busy today.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.;45.0192;-93.4311285714286
