Seemed to fall to earth, and not continue over the horizion.  Very bright, below overcast cieling. On November 4, 1998 at approximately 8:30pm CST while getting in a car with a friend, I noticed from overhead, a brilliant green fireball streaking downward, and towards the northwest at high speeds.  It had a long tail, much like a comet, except it too was green.  It was very low, beneath the overcast cieling, and seemed to fall to earth before it reached the horizion.  I was surprised at how bright it was, because I could see it, despite the flourescent lights of a nearby gas station which was between me and the object.  The sighting lasted for only one or two seconds, but it was definitely not a typical shooting star.;45.0192;-93.4311285714286

I called my husband and we watched it until it went to the other side of the horizon.  We've never seen anything like it.  Not a plane, helicopter or drone.  Saw videos on You Tube that looked exactly like it.  It fly effortlessly with sound.;45.0192;-93.4311285714286
