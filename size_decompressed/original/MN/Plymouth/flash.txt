Very bright, streaking object blueish green in color traveling west over the western suburbs of Minneapolis.;2006-10-04 22:36:00;3 seconds;Very bright, streaking object blueish green in color traveling west over the western suburbs of Minneapolis. At approximately 10:40pm CDT, I observed a blueish/green meteor like flash cross the sky, but very close to the earth's surface, maybe 2,000 to 5,000 feet off the ground. It was traveling west. It moved out past some homes close to my house and I lost sight of it. There was no noise at all, just a very brilliant blueish/green streak going across the sky. My first thought was a plane on fire, but there was no engine noise.;45.0192;-93.4311285714286
