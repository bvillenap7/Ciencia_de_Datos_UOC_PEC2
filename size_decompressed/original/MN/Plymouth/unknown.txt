Possible sighting in Plymouth, MN;2006-01-10 04:00:00;15 minutes;Possible sighting in Plymouth, MN Wife woke up to a bright almost purple white light outside of 1st level apartment.  Looked like a helicoptor search light, but stationary and brighter.  Children in 3rd floor apartment woke up screaming and ran into parents bedroom screaming of aliens and to shut the door.  Child is 2 years old and hasn't watched anything regarding aliens or UFO's.  Wife saw light closed eyes thinking it was a plow, but there was no snow on the street to be plowed, no cars on the street either.  Opened eyes again to see it was still there, got out of bed and it disappeared.  There was no sound when it disappeared or when it was visible.;45.0192;-93.4311285714286
