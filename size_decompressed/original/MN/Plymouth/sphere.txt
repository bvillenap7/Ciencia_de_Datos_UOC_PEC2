It was a sphere copper in color it was divided into two halfs and the top half was divided in two also with the top right corner a darker red then the rest.I couldnt believe what I saw but told my friends abouted and they said I was nuts. Well three years later I was searching ancient ufo art online  when I came across a painting from the french book The book of morals. The painting shows a person in a long cone hat giving seeds to two farmers and in the sky a sphere the exact thing I saw in 2003.This painting was done in the year 1338. Now I swear I never saw that painting before my encounter yet the spheres are identical, what are the chances? Divided into two halfs and the top divided in two and the same color and size.I think I now have some sort of proof that it was not my imagination. The thing must have appeared in view of the patio window and not just a fly by or I would not have seen it. It went east at lighting speed from a dead stop and it was about 2/3 the size of a hot air baloon 100 yards above ground over Plymouth, Minnesota south west corner of hwy. 169 and 42th av n. It's wierd right over a big city 100 yards above a highway. Now I wonder if the guy with the pointy hat in the painting is covering his long skull, because archaeologists have found skulls in Peru with long skulls and they can't be human.I don't know what to make of this but it is very weird to see something that somebody painted 665 years ago.;45.0192;-93.4311285714286
