Orange/Yellow Fireball across the sky with a curve;2014-05-17 21:45:00;~60 seconds;Orange/Yellow Fireball across the sky with a curve Witnessed a fairly large orange/yellow fireball which seemed very close over the north sky of Lindstrom, MN.  I immediately took out my cell phone to record, but it didn't appear on the screen even though a much dimmer star to its left showed up.  At first I thought it was a plane on fire, but then it started elevating and curved its direction roughly 45 degrees.  Even at its greatest distance I could still see the flickering which closest resembled fire.  There was no sound emitted at all.;45.3856;-92.8486
