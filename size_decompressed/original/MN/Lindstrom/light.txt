I was out stargazing at the nearby county park with a new college friend.  It was a pretty cloudy night, with not many visible celestial bodies to begin with.  We both sighted a couple satellites moving across the sky early on.  After about an hour of being out under the stars and clouds, I spotted a stationary light towards the east start to move, at a similar speed as satellites do in the night sky.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but the speed of the satellite seemed to be varying.  I remember thinking, no way, if that's a UFO I am going to flip.   The light then completely turned and started moving 90 degrees in a different direction.  That's when I got giddy!  And it continued its erratic flight for a good four or five minutes, increasing and decreasing in speed, even stopping every so often for a couple seconds, zig-zagging around the same area in the sky, and changing directions quickly, too fast for a plane to be capable of doing by my estimates.  But eventually I lost sight of it in the clouds.  This was the first time I've ever seen anything like that! Such a cool experience.;45.3856;-92.8486
