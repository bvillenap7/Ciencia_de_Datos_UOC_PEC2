Cromwell, Minnesota.... Deer Hunting Opening Day....Carlton County Movings Lights;2003-09-15 05:30:00;5 minutes;Cromwell, Minnesota.... Deer Hunting Opening Day....Carlton County Movings Lights On the Opening Day of Deer Hunting of fall 2003 in Minnesota. I got up at 5:00 and headed out to my deer stand with my .308. I got up ito my deer stand which was in a woody, hilly area and noticed a star looking figure that was moving around in a busy movement. I just didn't what the heck it was, so I looked up at it with my high powered scope and it basicly looked like a star. Later, another star light popped up and then the two went slowly away from me and dissapeared just as the light day was starting to appear. I told my dad this later in the day and he thought that it was wierd. I know this for sure, for those last two weeks of hunting I watched the skies and saw many more sightings of the same kind, and I have been a little scared since the incidents. I would really like to know what these occurences are. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));46.6718;-92.8739
