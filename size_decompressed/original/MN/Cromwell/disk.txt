Silver disk, with soft blue light in the center.;2003-09-30 22:00:00;1 minute;Silver disk, with soft blue light in the center. In back seat of car driving on Highway 210 heading toward McGregor.  I was looking out the window at the scenery,  I noticed a light coming through the tree line.  It continued horizontal to our direction it was about 120 feet in the air the shape of the craft was a silver rimmed disk with a large, very pretty blue colored light in the center.  I would estimate its size to be about the length of two cars.  It went directly over our car, making no sound and continued north out of sight [tree line blocked it] the other person in the back seat saw it as well.  Definitely something I will never forget!
