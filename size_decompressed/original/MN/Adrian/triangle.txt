The north 2 red circular lights were in line and the south one was spaced equally apart but on the south side and all lights moved at same speed.  They faded out as it got more to the west.  It took about 3-5sec from point i seen them to when they faded out.  Moved a little slower than a falling star and made no noise at all.;43.6197;-95.9273
