My wife and I were heading home from Duluth Minnesota, south on interstate 35 on Feb. 8th 1997 at dusk, the sun was setting but there was still some light. About 2 miles north of Stacy Minnesota (North of Wyoming Minnesota) My wife said, look it's going to crash ! I looked out side window of the truck, and seen this .... I don't know what it was, it had 5 or more strobe lights lighting up one at a time around the perimeter of the object. I coundn't make out the shape because it was dusk, but I could see something. The craft came towards the ground at a steep angle and pulled up at the last second and went up..up..up. We watched for what seemed to be about a minute, I never did stop or pull off the freeway, I was just so amazed I didn't think of stopping ! The freeway runs parallel with state highway 61, the two roads are about 1/4 mile apart where we seen it, so it must have been about half way between interstate 35 and state hwy 61, about 1/8 mile from our truck. The freeway had alot of traffic, some one else had to see this, who would be playing in plane at this time of the evening, in the winter ? I thought plane only had one or two lights? I am only reporting this now because I have just learned about you and I am a big ufo secptic, but I also learned about a week later my in-laws, who winter in Phenoix, seen something really strang in march, which made the news. So I wanted to know if anyone else had seen what we seen ?;45.3999;-93.0184
