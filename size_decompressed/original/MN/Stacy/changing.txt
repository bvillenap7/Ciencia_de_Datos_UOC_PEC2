I thougt they were orbs. The lights floated near by and I assumed they noticed I was watching them.  For some reason it was like they were watching me because they lingered for that long without disappearing and revealed themselves.  Since that day, I have been scared/paranoid because I didn't know what it actually was, or what the presence of these energies meant. This morning at 1:00 a.m., I went into my garage, looked out of the door window into my backyard and gazed at a beautiful starry night.  Then, I noticed one of the stars was close and moving inconsistently at different speeds all over a specific area.  I took a look at the rest of the stars to notice that ALL of the stars were moving. It was so hard to believe what I was seeing because there were over hundreds of lights moving near and far that imitated stars.  I tried to look for stars that were still, but there were none.  I tried to convince myself that the moving lights could have been anything else, but it was an undeniable site to see. Many of the light's movements were synced and some abnormally flickerd, or would disappear and reappear. I watched every single light bounce around in the sky and became angry because it didn't seem real, for it was like a fantasy, and why did I actually see this happen. Imagine looking at a clear night sky  in the middle of no where(where I'm from) and realizing they are all mysterious, unexplainable, vibrant balls of light that continuously moved, and occasionally morphed into different shapes.  The amount of moving lights frightened me because the whole sky covered almost completely.  What would you think was happening?;45.3999;-93.0184
