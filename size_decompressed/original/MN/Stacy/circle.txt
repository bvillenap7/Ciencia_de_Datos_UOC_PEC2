PD));2017-02-20 21:00:00;30;I was driving to our new house with a load of stuff and maintained the same schedule two nights in a row.  Both nights Feb 19th and Feb 20th.  I saw an enormous glowing light in the same location.  It was not blinking.  Other aircrafts were in the sky and there blinking lights seemed tiny compared to it.  The light went from a bright yellowish white glow to a green hue. Both nights it seemed to almost follow me.  It managed to stay in view all the way home to Coon Rapids.  How has no one reported it.  It appears to be stationary and switches from a green hue to a bright white and appears twice the size of planes around it.   My girlfriend had a migraine and was not amused by my excitement.;45.3999;-93.0184
