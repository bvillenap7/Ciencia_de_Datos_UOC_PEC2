I awoke the whole family I was a young teen, and awoke in the middle of the night and looked out my window.  It was noiseless.  it was right above the highway only about 50 feet up.  The neighbors horses were running and rearing.  I awoke everyone in the house so that they could see it.  I was sure glad that it was still there.  My family acted so srange.  They were mad for being awoken. Everyone got extemely tired and went back to bed.  I stayed up and watched it for as long as I could.  I fell asleep at the window.  I woke up before daylight and it was gone.  Years later as an adult it haunts me.  I saw the neighbor lady one time while taking the kids to visit my mom.  I risked humiliation by telling her that I saw it. She lit up like a switch and told me that I was not crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.
