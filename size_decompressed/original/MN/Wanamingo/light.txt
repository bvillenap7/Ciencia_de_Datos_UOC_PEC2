Thunderstorm bright red orb;2013-08-06 21:00:00;5 minutes;Thunderstorm bright red orb It wasn't completely dark when the other witness an I decided to go get groceries in zumbrota.  It haven't rained yet but there was talk of a pretty good sized storm on the way. In the north east there was a huge cloud build up you could see when it would lighting I did notice this very bright flashy red orange light that was very bright  in the sky not to high up or far away but no to strange because it was at a spot that I considered it to be a helicopter.  But as we got just about 2 miles from zumbrota it got brighter an the other person with me pointed it out an asked what it was.  I laughed saying oh it's going to disappear probably ball Ignoring telling them of what that was while we drove past a pretty good sized hill for a moment and when we could see that portion on the sky again it really was gone in 10 seconds this huge flickering red orange light disappears in thin air I still thing ball lighting but I read there's a lot strange things that are happening with these kinda of lights so I thought I'd share;44.3134;-92.8099
