When I returned in a minute or so from waking another in the house to see this, it was gone.  I continued to search in all directions in the sky, but seen nothing like it or have ever seen anything like it before.  The whole siting lasted a minute or so.  It was a clear night with many stars.  I am not in the star field, but do gaze upon the sky often, but have never seen anything like this before, I have seen shooting stars and the northern lights and it was not like that.
