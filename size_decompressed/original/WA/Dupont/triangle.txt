I had just finished watching a DVD around 2 am this morning.  I was really tired so I decided to go to bed. When I went into my room, I looked out my window to see the stars. This is something I do every single night. The thing immeadietly caught my attention because I had never noticed it there before. From the angle I was looking at it from my window, I saw 3 orange lights spaced at consistent intervals. From what I could tell, the object(s) were quite high in the sky. I became very excited and ran out back to get a better view. When I opened the back door, my mom heard this and woke up. She was amazed at it as well. She figured it was something to do with Ft.Lewis (the gigantic forested army base within 1 mile from our neighborhood, Northwest Landing). I made no reservations as to what it was. The shape changed, rather, the angle changed as I went out back to get a better look. From then on, it just looked like a blob of vaguely 3 orange lights in a triangle pattern. Within about 15 minutes, it had moved somewhat to my right. I noticed this because when I went back to my room, it had become obscured by the roofline of the house, meaning that it moved to the right. Another interesting thing is that the orangeness emmitted a glow. Together, the 3 oranges formed a saucer shaped halo in the sky. It looked so much like a street lamp just sitting there. That is what mostly caught my attention, the aura of it. I knew it was not a star or a satellite or a helicopter or an airplane. It was completely unique. I will watch out for it every single night from now on. I really hope that somebody else saw it, besides my mother. I bet someone did.;47.1140571428571;-122.652185714286
