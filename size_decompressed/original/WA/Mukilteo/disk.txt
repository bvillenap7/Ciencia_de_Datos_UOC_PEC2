While turning to the south west about .5 miles north of the whales two disk shaped objects appeared.  The second one was trailing to the right about 150 feet.  Using the whales as a reference, I would say the objects were about 30 feet across, and traveling at 1500 foot above the water.  The objects then just disappeared.

Telephoned Report:  A woman, who formerly served as an airplane spotter for the military, looked up almost directly overhead, and was shocked to witness a metallic-looking disc-shaped craft, visible between two clouds.  She estimated that its apparent size, from her vantage point, was approximately equal to that of the Sun. The object was moving from the north to the southwest, she estimated, and was visible for only a few seconds. She was hesitant to submit a report over the internet, given that she does not have a computer.;47.9145;-122.2984
