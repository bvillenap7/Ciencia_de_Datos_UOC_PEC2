3 bright lights in triangular formation over the southern skies of Mukilteo.;2010-07-07 23:00:00;15-30 seconds;3 bright lights in triangular formation over the southern skies of Mukilteo. My husband who is an aerospace engineer and I were sitting on our deck as we often do having a discussion about satellites and star gazing looking for them.  I was looking to the south and thought I had spotted one and when I pointed it out to my husband, I realized the star wasn't moving but the light next to it was, then two more lights appeared above the first light   It was as if someone plugged in the lights, 3 very distinct lights lit up in a triangular formation.  Completely equal distant from each other and exactly identical in brightness and size appeared in the sky.  We both couldn't believe what we were seeing and then the two lights at what appeared to be the top of the formation disappeared, quickly followed by the last light. We sat and questioned what we had seen and tried to logically come up with some type of explanation and the only thing we could come up with was that it was an unidentified flying object or objects.  No explanations, no reason, it was the strangest thing I have ever seen in the night sky! ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD));47.9145;-122.2984
