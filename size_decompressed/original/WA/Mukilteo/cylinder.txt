2 Bright glowing lights over Paine Field, (Boeing) in Everett Washington;2003-07-22 21:00:00;5 minutes;2 Bright glowing lights over Paine Field, (Boeing) in Everett Washington I was talking on the phone to my mother and standing out on my deck around sunset last night. I told my mother what I was seeing and got off the phone to pay attention. I saw a very bright light in the sky, that was alternating white to gold, with a bit of red and then mostly white light, that I thought was a planet, and I looked again and saw it was an aircraft of some sort.  The location was directly above Paine Field, the Boeing plant in Everett Washington.  There was a LOT of aircraft activity in the sky, some very fast moving jets were flying around.  It was easy for me to tell after a few moments, that this object was hovering and it was not a regular plane or coptor. All of a sudden, out of the blue, another one appeared.  This one was in a direct line to the right and made a perfect angle.  They both sat there glowing for about 3-5 mins. I called the local television station and told them what I was seeing.  As I continued to look, the top object, the larger brighter one moved in a dirct line up then moved to the right, the lights dimmed and I was able to see a shape.  As best as I can describe it, it was like a cylinder, and it had a metallic look like nothing I have ever seen before.  Then it completely disappeared.  It kind of like, dimmed, and then it was absolutely gone!  Then the other one did the same thing, and I turned my back for an instant, looked back and there was absolutely no sign of it.  I called Paine Field to try to get someone on the phone, but there was only an answering machine and I told them what I saw, but no one has called me back.;47.9145;-122.2984
