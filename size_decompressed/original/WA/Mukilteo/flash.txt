Bright/white round flash in Mukilteo;2011-10-08 01:00:00;4 seconds;Bright/white round flash in Mukilteo About 1 am Saturday morning, October 8, 2011 I was waiting to turn onto Harbour Pointe Blvd from 50th Pl W in Mukilteo.  As I was looking West towards the water, I saw a bright, almost white ball/flash shoot straight up, then it turned and headed Northwest and disappeared.  It was partly cloudy that night, but in the area I saw the flash, it was pitch black and this flash was almost pure white.  I turned and went in that direction to see if I could see anything else but didnâ€™t.;47.9145;-122.2984
