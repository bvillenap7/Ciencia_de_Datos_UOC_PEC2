Craft that turned in fireball-orb!;2004-07-16 22:17:00;5 seconds;Craft that turned in fireball-orb! When I was getting ready for bed, I took a moment to look out the window of my apartment.  Upon noticing the clear sky, I saw what appeared to be a small craft, like an airplane or satellite, traveling from north to south at a slow pace.  As I studied it, I thought it might have been an aircraft coming to or from Paine field, which is a ½ mile away.  Then a second later, the craft sped up with extreme, high velocity across the sky and suddenly turned into a bright, yellowish fireball-orb.  It raced across the sky with great speed and made a quick zigzag motion before flying out across the southeast direction of the horizon.  I have seen plenty of shooting stars in my lifetime, but this was no shooting star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));47.9145;-122.2984
Red light seen over Mukilteo, WA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from witness with commercial/ATP pilot rating.  PD));2012-07-12 00:25:00;5-8 minutes;Red light seen over Mukilteo, WA I was out walking my dogs on July 12, 2012, from midnight to 1am.  Weather conditions were clear, no moonlight, starts could be seen.    While walking east, I saw a red ball of light with an orange colored center go straight up, to approximately 500 to 700 AGL.  The red and orange colors were blended.  The light did have a pulsing action, about one pulse per every second or two.  At first, I thought it was a firework, but there were no dissipating lights going outward as a firework would go off and dissipate.  This light had come towards me, approximately the same altitude, again 500 to 700 AGL, and was about ½ to 1 mile away.  The light slowed down, and whoever was flying it, had definite control over its course, speed, and altitude.  I thought for a minute, maybe it was an unmanned balloon, but a balloon would drift, and again, this had definite controlled movements.  As I continued walking my dogs because they were now pulling me to come along, I pointed to my dog,! look up, but of course, they are dogs, whatever, lets go.  As I continued to move forward, this light gained altitude, about a 500 fpm climb, nothing drastic, and headed on its way south to south-westbound.  When I looked over my shoulder, it was on that course, about 3000 feet or so higher, on its merry way.  Within a few minutes, I checked my phone for the time, which was 12:38am.  I was not scared, it was quite intriguing to me.  I specifically put in the pilot details, because that is what I am.   I hold an ATP certificate with 6600 hrs, and am a good judge of how high or fast an aircraft is going, or its direction, just like any other experienced pilot.

Orange orb sighting over Mukilteo, Washinton.;2014-07-13 23:00:00;3 minutes;Orange orb sighting over mukilteo, washinton 1st siting we saw an orange glowing orb flying from west to south east direction at a slow rate of speed slower than an airplane.  There was no noise.  About 10 minutes later we saw another orange orb with a white center fly the same direction but closer.   The size relative to the moons size that night was approximately 15%.  Both times we saw it duration was approximately 3 minutes.;47.9145;-122.2984
