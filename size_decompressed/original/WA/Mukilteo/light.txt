Additional sighting of Greenish ball of light.;1998-09-23 23:10:00;2 sec;Additional sighting of Greenish ball of light. While listening to the Art Bell radio show and hearing about the sightings, I walked outside of the building where I work and started looking around.  I was facing at 310 degrees (compass heading) and looking up at what I think was the Big Dipper.  To the left of the handle of the Big Dipper, at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon, a ball of white light with a greenish glow arround the circumfrence  looked as if it dropped straight down.  The light  lasted about 2 full seconds.  I'm not sure if there was a tail or just the image of the bright light on my  retina.  I would approximate the size of the ball of light as about 5 to 10  times the size of the dot of light of Jupiter which was in the sky behind me.;47.9145;-122.2984
Light moving slowly, haphazardly in the western/northwestern sky, nearly halfway up the horizon.;2003-01-17 20:00:00;8 hours;Light moving slowly, haphazardly in the western/northwestern sky, nearly halfway up the horizon. For the past 4 nights, have seen what looks like a bright star in the northwest/west part of sky, a little less than halfway up the horizon.  Light moves haphazardly, sometimes in circles, sometimes up, down, or diagonally.  Doesn't move far and doesn't move fast.  Have to watch it a while to observe movements. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is looking at Venus and Sirius, but that is a guess.  PD));47.9145;-122.2984
