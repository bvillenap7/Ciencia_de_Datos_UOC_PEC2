Flashing lights that are red and blue, floating type movement, with no noise.;2012-08-04 00:30:00;30 minutes;flashing lights that are red and blue, floating type movement, with no noise. A light appeared in the sky to the west.  We at first thought it was a planet but noticed it was flashing blue and red.  We also observed it floating through the sky.  It had no noise and appeared to be going no where.  We got out our telescope to see if it was a plane or helicopter and it was neither.  It stayed in the sky for thirty minutes.  We live near a airforce base and watch military and civilian craft each day this was the strangest thing we have ever seen.;47.0231;-122.2886

I stepped out of my front door in Graham, WA, at about 6:25 pm Sunday November 10th.  There was a cloud cover but no rain or wind.   I immediately noticed a large, bright, round, orange ball of light just under the cloud cover and about 1/2 mile away from me to the west.  The ball flickered like fire and barely moved forward casting an orange glow on the underside of the clouds above it.  When it moved it bobbled slightly instead of staying in a smooth trajectory.  It made absolutely no sound and was about 90% from the horizon.   The fireball was approximately the size of a full moon.  The light began to fade and I realized it was moving up into the cloud cover and then disappeared.  The whole sighting lasted about one minute. I am a 66 year old retired person who has lived in the area of Joint Base Lewis McChord all my life and quite used to regular aircraft.  I told a pilot friend of mine about the sighting and he had no idea as to what it could be.;47.0231;-122.2886
