This siting has been made approximately 3 times in a week. There are on occasion more than one of these craft...sometimes 2 or 3 in a triangular configuration. The craft appears to be cigar or flat  saucer in shape...and has a white light and flashing red and blue-green lights. It makes no sound and appears stationary. It is viewed to the south. It seems to have the ability to dim itself when there are aircraft in the vicinity. It usually remains in the area for approximately an hour and then simply disappears.;47.0231;-122.2886

However it was brighter than any other I,d ever seen It was moving in a south easterly direction toward Mt. Rainier. I noted no blinking lights that would make me think it was an airplane. It's shape was elongated and it was entirely bright. I thought it may be the space station, however I heard no mention of it on the news regarding it's visability at this particular time frame. I watched it and even though the skies were clear not a cloud in sight, It mearly dissapeared like the men walking into the corn in the movie .. Field of DEreams.Do you have an answer for me?;47.0231;-122.2886
