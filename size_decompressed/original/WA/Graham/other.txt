My brother and I were on my front porch when I happened to look up to see what, at first, I thought to be a falling or shooting star.  Then I realized that it didn't move at an angle like a star would.  Then I thought it was a rocket, but it didn't make any noise.  My brother yelled for our Mom and his wife to come out and see this! and he told me to get my camera.  My sister and her friend pulled up and got out of the car as I was running to get the camera.  I dashed out and took a picture from in front of my house and ran to the side yard to take a second one.  We all saw this firey rather long narrow object for well over a minute.  It descended at a slow steady rate of speed toward the earth.  I was so struck by what I saw that I didn't even think to really focus on the object that was higher in the sky and very bright.  We are pretty normal people who were gathered for a family Halloween Party.  We are ages 22 to 56.  I was struck most by the slow steady, non-angular movement of this thing.;47.0231;-122.2886
