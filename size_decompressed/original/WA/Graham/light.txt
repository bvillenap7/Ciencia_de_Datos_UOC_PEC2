Small red light flew slowly straight up and disappeared;1998-02-06 02:45:00;45 sec.;Small red light flew slowly straight up and disappeared I was driving home from Seattle, and approximatley 2 mi. from my home, I saw what appeared at first to be a small red reflector (the type people put on mailbox stands so you can see them in your headlights). As I approached (within 20 yards or so), the reflector began moving straight up at perhaps 15-20 ft.per second. I stopped the car, and watched it go up for at least 30-40 seconds, and then it just disappeared from sight. It was dead silent as it rose, and it was moving so smoothly it just didn't seem real.;47.0231;-122.2886

Several bright orange lights in the sky.;2010-05-08 22:15:00;15 minutes;Several bright orange lights in the sky. On the night of Saturday May 9, 2010 in the city of Graham, Washington.  I was at home with my family watching TV. My sister who lives down the street called us and told us to go outside and look at the sky. When we went outside we saw six or seven bright orange light moving in the sky. They seemed to be in two groups and the lights were moving steadily in different directions. My sister, who had watched the lights for about ten minutes before she called us, said that when she first saw them they were above the horizon facing east forming a “T” shape.By the time we got outside they were above the horizon facing south. Then one by one they disappeared. This happened at about 10:15 PM. I tried calling the Air Force which is several miles away. They didn’t see anything or seem too interested. Which I can understand, I would probably say the same thing if I didn’t see them with my own eyes. I also tried calling the local news stations they probably thought I was joking. There are many videos on youtube that show exactly what I saw. Unexplainable orange bright lights in the sky.;47.0231;-122.2886
Glowing bright red light observed suspended above pasture in Graham, Washington, June 1, 2012.;2012-06-01 23:24:00;3 minutes;Glowing bright red light observed suspended above pasture in Graham, Washington, June 1, 2012. A glowing red object was observed from the second story of my house at 11:24pm the night of  June 1, 2012. A single, large red light was seen over the neighbor's horse pasture and community pond.  The object was silent and enveloped in a swirl of thin fog.  The red light shone steadily and did not fade, wink out, or move.  Because of the thin fog swirling around, the rays of light coming out of the red object was reminiscent of old illustrations of illumined beings stepping out of the sky. I had just been looking out another window on the same side of the house, finished in that room and walked down the hall, past two other rooms to check on the window in the small bedroom.  That's when I saw it. In the no more than 12 seconds it took for me to walk from one bedroom to the next and open the drapes, it appeared. The object remained in a stationary position, suspended at about 200 feet in the air. I watched it for about a minute.  As I watched this strange red object, I started to feel as though I was being hypnotized.  I felt a panic begin to envelop me, a growing fear of what it might do.  This is what really surprised me more than anything during this whole event, the fear of some unknown evil glowing red and watching my neighborhood.  I pulled myself away from the window, partly to share the news and partly to get away from it. I ran across the hall to inform other family members, then returned to resume my watch.  I went to a different room on the same floor to see if I might be able to see more than just the light, perhaps to see the definition of some larger shape.  Alas, when I looked out that window, the glowing red light had vanished. In the time I saw it, probably a minute and the less than a minute   I spent running from one room to another, it vanished.  The entire episode was concluded by 11:27pm. No other family members saw it.  For some time afterward, we looked out other windows, but did not see anything that could have been identified as the red light.  We did not go outdoors. The weather conditions were: light breeze, slight drizzle, thin fog, damp air. No moon or stars were observed, which is not uncommon in Western Washington.  The cloud cover often obscures the night sky.  There were no traffic noises from the highway a half a mile away.  No night birds sang or dogs barked.  No airplanes or helicopters broke the still night air.  The only sound was the sound of frogs from the nearby pond.  Because of the drizzle, no backyard fires glowed in the neighborhood either. Everyone was indoors.  It was an usually quiet Friday night.;47.0231;-122.2886
Bright white orb of light lasting several minutes.;2016-10-01 20:00:00;3;Bright white orb of light lasting several minutes While walking our dog between 7-8pm - not sure exact time - we saw a bright white light in the sky.  It was at similar elevation as the aircraft that frequently fly over from seatac but further to the east.  It appeared three dimensional- like an orb. It was silent and very bright. It was not flying in a straight line - rather it was more erratic.  It was heading away from us, but we were able to see the light.  No strobes.  NOT an airplane.   We stopped and watched it for several minutes, then it faded within 10-15 seconds and was gone.  The bright whiteness of the light caught our eye.;47.0231;-122.2886
One really brite white light moving south across the sky;2017-07-23 21:58:00;7 minutes;One really brite white light moving south across the sky At 21:58 I was outside in my front yard smoking when I saw what I thought was an airplane flying south. As I watched it I couldn't see any blinking lights and the other planes that I could see flying in the same area had blinking red or white lights.  The craft that I was looking at only had one really bright white light and no blinking lights.  I watched the light / craft until I couldn’t see it any more.  I watched it, trying to see if I could see if it had any blinking lights.  I was not able to see any blinking lights.  The craft was too high in the sky to make out if it had any kind of shape.;47.0231;-122.2886
