Meteor like object seen South of Mt. Rainier;2004-06-05 01:00:00;1 minute 45 sec.;Meteor like object seen South of Mt. Rainier Fireball seen in the sky South of Mt. Rainier. Rather large object that didnt seem to be very far away. At first the object was falling straight down towards Earth but then leveled out for a few moments until it finally dropped behind the mountains.Object had a rather long tail of fire on it and seemed to be traveling very fast.;47.0231;-122.2886
big oval flash, which lit up the whole sky.. numerous times distinctly.;2005-12-01 21:00:00;split seconds. off and on;big oval flash, which lit up the whole sky.. numerous times distinctly. I was in my car, on canyon road (in graham) heading towards puyallup. (clear skies that night, keep that in mind..not a cloud anywhere) so the sstars were out, it was very clear. and as i was heading my way to get on canyon road, i saw a big oval flash in teh sky way above the tree-line. and the flash was like a camera, it lit up the whole sky likea camera flash for a split second. at first i thought it was thnder or lightning maybe, then i realized there is no clouds out. its to clear out. so as i was on canyon road, the flash appeared again, the whole sky lit up for a second. but u could see the oval shape lighten up eveyr time. it was a big great oval shape. i couldnt tell of any movement, just these very weird flashes. i didnt see any airplanes moving around. i made my way to 512, heading north towards seattle. getting on 167.. i kept seeing the flashes, it appears the oval shape was directly over puyallup. i turned on the radio to see if anyone was talking about it. couldnt find anything on it. i should have posted this the following day but i just kept putting this off. i dont know what it was up there. did anyone else in this area see what im talking about?? well anyway, thats my story. thanks.;47.0231;-122.2886
Super Bright Object appears over Graham, Washington in the SW sky approximately 7:30PM on 1/19/2009.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2009-01-19 19:30:00;1 hour;Super Bright Object appears over Graham, Washington in the Southwest sky approximately 7:30PM on 1/19/2009 Upon coming home approximately at 7:30PM, I observed an extremely superbright star  in the Southwest sky. The object was not moving. I ran to get my camera and took a picture of it. When I enlarged the picture, it appears to be circular with a greenish-light blue and purple background and appears to have craters and a rough moon-like surface. Within an hour, the object traveled quickly and disappeared. I thought perhaps this was a new planet, but when it disappeared, that was not possible. I called one friend immediately and she looked out to the Southwest and saw the object and took a picture as well. A third person we called later said she saw the object traveling quickly away and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));47.0231;-122.2886
Cluster of Orange Lights Moving Rapidly Across the Horizon In Changing Formations;2010-05-08 22:15:00;1 minute;Cluster of Orange Lights Moving Rapidly Across the Horizon In Changing Formations At approximately 10:15 p.m. my daughter opened the front door and asked me to come quickly and see this.  At that time I noticed a formation of bright, orange balls that seemed to be roughly in the shape of a diagonal line.  (approximately two-o'clock on a clock).  I say roughly because one ball appeared to be out of the line and further ahead.  I initially thought it was a military craft formation of some sort moving from the southeast, however as they got closer, it became apparent that this was not something mechanical.  There was absoulely no noise at all, and no trails of smoke or vapor were behind them.  They were located not too far above the horizon (meaning I did not have to look too far up to see them).  They appeared to be moving rapidly to the west and the pattern they were moving in changed as they moved.  There did not appear to be grouped in any shape now as they were moving.  Right before they disappeared, they clustered up together in two ci! rcles and then started winking out one by one.   The entire occurrene took less than two minutes, and it scared the heck out of my ten year old.  Most definitely not anything I have ever seen, and we have seen plenty of military crafts and manuevers in our area over the years.  They were not large in relation to the size of the moon, however they were much larger than stars and as I said much lower in the horizon.;47.0231;-122.2886
