I have finally witnessed it for myself.  As I was outside this evening I noticed a bright light in the sky that resembled a very bright star.  As I looked at it I noticed it went from bright to dim, then it would go completely black and return to full brightness. I found this to be odd and alerted my two sons, my mother, and my husband.  I showed them this object in the sky to the west of our home.  We watched it for some time and noticed there were a couple of more objects, yet they were smaller in size and and were orange in color.  These objects seemed to float from side to side as if they were in a sweeping motion. We witnessed this for some time until these objects started descending downward and further west. It then disappeared out of sight.;47.011;-123.4026
