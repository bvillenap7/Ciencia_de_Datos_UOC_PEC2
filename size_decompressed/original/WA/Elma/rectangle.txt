Fast moving, bright shimmering rectangular object near Elma WA in daylight;2016-09-10 12:00:00;3-5 seconds;Fast moving, bright shimmering rectangular object near Elma WA in daylight On 9-10-16, apx. 12-1210pm, while on my daily walk, I saw a large, shimmering, fast moving, rectangular shaped object for 3 to 5 seconds. The sky was clear blue, cloudless, windless, sun up and shining. I was near Utility Lane, Elma, Washington, walking eastwards.  Elevation is about 300 ft.  The object appeared to head from Northerly direction east of ELMA to a Southerly direction towards Oakville, over the tops of hills that are about 500 ft in elevation.  After about 3 seconds, it turned to a black color, and dropped in altitude, and became obscured by a closer hill. Never saw object again.  Did not hear any sound. Unable to determine distance and size of object from my vantage point. Speed was significantly faster than a standard prop plane.  Also, there were no noticeable aircraft flying even though there is a small airport nearby, and this is in a flight path for military aircraft as well as SEA-TAC International airport. I've seen many planes, ultralights and helicopters on a near daily basis in the area, over many years, and this was not one of them. The only reason for this report is the extremely bright shimmering, approaching a welding arc color in brightness. Difficult to look at. Even aluminum skinned planes aren't this bright!  As a side note, I mentioned this to a friend in Oakville, WA. She was on the phone to a friend in California when she heard a sudden thundering sound that somewhat echoed, and was gone as fast as it started. She heard this about the same time as I witnessed the object in question, from my location about 15 miles away. It may or may not be related.;47.011;-123.4026
