Large round light didn't move, grew larger, changed shape and color, then blinked out.;2007-03-05 17:00:00;1 minute;Large round light didn't move, grew larger, changed shape and color, then blinked out. It was a white light,round in shape and was directly overhead. It was stationary between two large clouds. At first it appeared to be a bright star. After a few seconds, it grew in diameter and became much brighter, almost like a large flash light several feet away. After several more seconds passed, the shape changed from round to an oval. While making this change in shape, the color of white light changed to an orange. The oval shape became more eliptical, then it blinked out. It was not seen again. After 40 plus years in life, I have never seen anything like it. There were no sounds, such as what you would hear from an aircraft.;46.9823;-123.8801
red/orange light zig zagging east to west;2011-01-03 22:00:00;one minute;red/orange light zig zagging east to west walked out of my house and a red/orange light in the sky immediately caught my eye. i mentioned it to my husband, who said it was a plane. i said no, because it was not flashing and was only one color. also no sound. it was moving east to west. then it started to dim and get bright again several times. the sky was clear, no clouds. it was moving at a steady pace, like a satelite would. then it dissappeared for about five seconds and then reappeared way further west, not the distance it would have traveled at the previous speed. then it zig zagged sharply for about ten seconds until it was out of sight.;46.9823;-123.8801
