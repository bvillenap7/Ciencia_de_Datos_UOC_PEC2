UFO fireball things were seen by a handful of people and our local polica department.  Spotted at aprox. 46.59.51.57 North and 123.52.57.23 West headed towar the ocean which is south east.  The first two stopped and hovered for aprox. 5 min and were joined by  the 3rd. Then all three flew straight up in the air.  My step dad ((name deleted)) didnt get any pic.s though.

7 fireball UFO crafts pass over Hoquiam.;2016-01-22 19:00:00;15 minutes;7 fireball UFO crafts pass over Hoquiam. I first saw 2 orange lights flying from the east that started changing directions as if flying in formation.  2 more sets of 2 fireball type crafts, then became visible, all moving west at first, next to each other, then moving behind each other, before shooting straight up into space.  At that time, 3 others were watching with me.  It was only then that I was able to get video of the last one, as it passed overhead and disappeared into the black sky.   There was no sound from any of the crafts.   A couple minutes later I witnessed military jets patrolling grid patterns.;46.9823;-123.8801
