Two spheres spotted and flew straight up into space.;2015-09-21 16:30:00;40 seconds;Two spheres spotted and flew straight up into space. My roomate and I were sitting in my backyard talking when we noticed two spheres really close to each other about 12,000-15,000 ft up.  It didn't look like a helicopter or a plane. It was also clear as day out so it was easy to see.  One sphere was larger and the other was a small sphere circling around it.  After about 30 seconds it picks up speed and flies straigt up.  I never seen anything like it before and it  is my first time seeing it so it really freaked me out but it disappeared within seconds after looking at it.  Straight up into space.  And there weren't any clouds, so it's not like it flew out of sight.;47.3957;-122.3036
