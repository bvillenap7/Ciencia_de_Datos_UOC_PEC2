3 orange fire like, round objects moving south in night sky.;2012-12-31 20:45:00;1-2 minutes;3 orange fire like, round objects moving south in night sky A very clear star filled sky. I was looking to the south west and noticed a very orange, like fire, round object moving slowly south, at a speed similar to a satellite.  Then a much bigger one rose up as if from the ground.  I thought at first it might be a firework as it is New Years eve.It looked exactly like it was something burning.  At that point the first one disappeared.  The bigger one looked as if it was coming closer to me but then began to move south the same as the first one,and slowly got smaller as it went until it also disappeared.I went in to tell my family, and then went back outside to look again.   Before I knew it, within seconds, I saw another one!  This one was to the south east, and was moving toward the west. It moved at the same rate as the other two.  I watched it for about 2 minutes.  It seemed to suddenly move south and also disappeared.  I am excited by this event and keep going outside to scan the star filled sky every 10 minutes or so, to! see if I can see more.   I would stay out looking up except it is really cold out.Did anyone else see these?;48.5062;-122.6291
very large white comet with tail, descending rapidly toward the ground;2018-12-06 23:00:00;~2 seconds;very large white comet with tail, descending rapidly toward the ground 	Date:        12-06-18 	Time:       11:00pm pac. (+/- a couple minutes)  	Location:  The north entrance of Deception Pass Bridge, HWY 20, between Anacortes and Oak Harbor WA, USA. The event started in the south south-east sky and went further east as it descended.  I was traveling in a southerly direction at the time. 	Witness:   Myself, traveling in my car alone on my usual commute home from work.  I was traveling at 40 mph with cruise control on.  As soon as I got home, I posted a brief of my sighting on Facebook. When I got to work on the 7th, I told many co-workers about it.  One, who saw my FB posting and was off work at the time said he saw it too.  Another, who was at work and traveling home about the same time, said he saw it as well.  	Event:      I saw a very bright flash of white light (similar to a lightening flash on a clear dark night) to my left. It lit up the entire half of the sky. I turned to it immediately and looked through the forward half of my driver's side window. I saw what I can best describe as a classical comet. It was a large white ball, followed by a very long and tapering white tail. If I was able to freeze it in position, and trace its outline with a marker on my window, the ball was the size of a nickel and the tail was between 8-10‚Äù.  It was descending toward the ground at an extremely steep angle, about 10-15 degrees shy of 90 (straight down). In terms of overall length, it took up roughly 30 degrees of sky. The entire event, from beginning to end lasted no more than about 2 seconds.  It is possible that it might have been slightly longer, because there is a large rock wall just to the left of the road at that position, so it could have blocked the view of it until I rounded the corner approaching the bridge. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and found him to be sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect he is an excellent, and highly reliable, witness.  PD));48.5062;-122.6291
