It had slight segments with lights in between each segment.  I guestimate 6 stories above us as my apartment is 2 stories high.  It moved/hovered slowly over us. It did not wriggle, it simply floated as though it were in an air current.  Then it completely disappeared with lights out.  In the past i have looked up in the n8ght sky & focused on a random star only to see that very star shoot off from a stationary position & leave a slight light trail.  This current ufo did not do that.  It was simply lights off.  I'm beginning to think they know when they are being looked at...;48.5062;-122.6291
