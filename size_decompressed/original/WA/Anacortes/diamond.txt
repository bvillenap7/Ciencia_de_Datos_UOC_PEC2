I heard a whistle sound and I looked up and saw a black Dimond shaped craft wiz by over head pretty high in the sky.  I saw it clearly, as it was a very clear day outside. Almost instantly all of the electronics on the boat started acting weird.  Soon after this is saw alot of strange aircraft activity in the sky in the area. I saw two different AWAX planes with the spinning radars on top, I saw one low flying jet, looked like a 737. It was flying so low I could see that it was painted metallic green and it had some unusual looking attachment on the bottom.   After that I saw what looked to be three army helicopters flying over the nearby hills on either side of where I was located. The electronics on the boat acted weird for at least two hours. I couldn't get a good phone signal at all until 1800. This activity i thought was very weird. And having the strange electronic inter! ference following it was extra weird.;48.5062;-122.6291
