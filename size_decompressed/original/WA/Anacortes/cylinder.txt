Anyways, the skies were mostly clear, blue backdrop and I was laying with my head north and my head south when a large, white cylindrical object cpught my eye. It moved in a perfect South to North trajectory directly over me. I could see it was a large white cylinder, with some black details on the white cylindrical body that I couldn't make out. Can you spot satalites during the day? And clear enough to make out the shape? It took approx 15 seconds to completely cross the sky from South to North and it seemed to be much higher than the cloud level. It caught me off guard and I tried to catch it on video but was afraid to look away and then not find it again. If I hadn't been staring at the sky  already, I would not have seen it. And the speed alone didn't give me much time either. I did not see any light on this obje! ct.;48.5062;-122.6291
