V-shaped black object crossing closely to moon.;2012-06-21 20:00:00;15 seconds;V shaped black object crossing closely to moon Ok, so I was at my house in Anacortes, WA, and I was on the front deck with some binoculars as I wanted to look at the moon because it was full and bright.   Looking through the binoculars I was checking out all the cool craters on it, than all of a sudden I see what appears to be an Upside Down Black V object travel across the moon in a horizontal direction from the bottom right side of the moon to the top left side of the moon.  It took the object about 15-25 seconds to cross the moon.  It was massive the end of the upside down v was very long, compared to the size of the moon in my binoculars it looked like an estimated 1/10 the size of the moon roughly.  It appeared to be extremely close to the moons surface as well.   Never seen anything like it in my life and never saw it again just that one time.  The shape was solid, there was no wings, flaps, etc. and I saw it very well with my binoculars.  An object that looked like the letter V but u! pside down and very large, near the end points of the bottom of the object looked sharp and very elongated.  I remember shortly after this sighting I made a post on abovetopsecret and only one other person says he saw the exact same thing as me but nobody else and I have not found anything else about it online.  Can provide more information if you contact me.  I drew an exact duplicate picture and report with exact date and time on paper but would have to find it.  Will get it if you request it.;48.5062;-122.6291
