Bright white diving light, accompanied by other lights that changed color.;2005-11-27 19:40:00;8 minutes;Bright white diving light, accompanied by other lights that changed color. My two children and I were driving home and my daughter and I saw a white ball diving down towards the earth, REALLY REALLY fast.  When we got to the spot where it would have crashed we saw a bright, white, blinking light where none had been before.  As we were talking about it it stopped blinking, then 3 popped on and were moving around above the trees.  I had to look forward to drive, but my daughter said one of the lights turned purple and another one turned green.  Thanks;48.5062;-122.6291
Green Orb does vertical drop, speeds off into oblivion faster than any object I've ever seen.;2008-10-22 01:23:00;appx. 5-10 seconds;Green Orb does vertical drop, speeds off into oblivion faster than any object I've ever seen. As a Security officer, I drive the same dark roads on an almost nightly basis. I work in an environment with a lot of golden colored lights on the buildings covering the ground in that area fairly non-reflective. At about 0123 hours on the 22nd of October 1008, I was driving North on a straight stretch of road. Clear as day, as if from nowhere, just over the refinery (where I work) a huge bright green orb dropped from the sky (I will not attempt to give a height in feet or miles, because I would more likely than not be WAY OFF!), the light seemed to come out from within the object, forming a perfect green circle. The ‘orb’ appeared, went into a straight vertical drop, hovered momentarily then shot North and slightly upward, faster than I have EVER seen ANYTHING move in my entire life. I was at once stricken with awe, terror and anger that I was alone in my witness. I proceeded (all the while watching the sky) to call my boss to tell him what I’d seen, as well as waking my wonderful Boyfriend who tried to convince me it was anything but a UFO.  I worked until 0900 hours and never saw it again, not that I’d seen it before in the near four years that I’ve lived here in the area, or the 25 years I’ve spent staring relentlessly at the stars. When I tried to find out if there had been some sort of falling satellite or Military activity, I found nothing. If this report prompts anyone else with better resources and know-how to do more research on what it may have been I would love to be notified of whatever can be said, or even if it’s somehow confidently accepted to be alien aircraft.;48.5062;-122.6291
Blue light fastly moving up and down.;2013-11-22 06:20:00;7-10 minutes;Blue light fastly moving up and down We were sitting in the ferry line on Guemes Island and I looked up toward the south above state ferry direction.   I saw a blue light moving slowly then it started to move up and down very fast and then shot off in the direction of the San Juan Islands.   I watched it for between 7 and 10 min. ((NUFORC Note:  Time confirmed with witness.  Boyfriend, who also witnessed object, may submit second report.  PD));48.5062;-122.6291
Orange-ish/golden lights seen in sky over Anacortes.;2015-01-24 23:30:00;2-3 minutes;Orange-ish/ golden lights seen in sky over Anacortes. I was driving home from work around 11:30pm, Saturday 1/24, on Hwy 20.   I saw some orange-ish/ golden lights in the sky forming two circular patterns.   As I was driving, I was not sure what I was looking at so I decided to pull over as I was coming around the bay.   The lights were southwest of where I was parked alongside the highway.  The lights were there for a few minutes, and then one by one they disappeared.    I've never seen anything like this, I still have no idea what I saw.;48.5062;-122.6291
Very bright, greenish, light in the sky.  Exhibited non-aircraft behavior.;2015-02-20 19:45:00;5 minutes;Very bright, greenish, light in the sky. Exhibited non-aircraft behavior. A bright object, greenish in color, approached overhead. Luminosity was comparable to a full moon.  An airplane started flying into the same patch of sky.   My wife and I observed the object come to a near stop to avoid the airplane, then change directory (90 degrees to the right and more than 90 degrees upward, into the atmosphere), and slowly disappear from view into clouds high in the sky.;48.5062;-122.6291
String of a little over 20 lights all traveling together extremely fast from W to E. ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-03 06:00:00;10 minutes;I saw a string of a little over 20 lights all traveling together extremely fast from west to East in the clear early morning sky. I saw what I thought was to be a satellite but it was accompanied by 2 more lights really close and I thought that was strange.  The 3 I saw were then being followed by several more after I watched for a second.  After  the other few showed up, the first 2 got into what looked like a straight line formation all heading from west to East at the same equal distance apart from each other.  I counted 11 and then started to freak out.  After a few more kept going by I started counting again and realized I just counted over 20 lights all traveling together.;48.5062;-122.6291
String of 20 paired lights moving west to east mid horizon.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-08-14 03:00:00;30 seconds;String of 20 paired lights moving west to east mid horizon. A perfect line of lights, 2 at a time with a small gap between each pair, moving west to east toward the crescent moon. About as fast as distant airplanes. Totally quiet, as bright as the stars nearby.  About 20-30 degrees above the horizon.  I have a photo!  Seen from Eagle Cove, Cypress Island.  Lost behind a hill.;48.5062;-122.6291
