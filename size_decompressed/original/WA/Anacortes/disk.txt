Daytime UFO in Anacortes, WA;2012-06-30 17:00:00;1 minute;Daytime UFO in Anacortes, WA On the evening of June 30, 2012 at 5:00 pm, I just dropped my girlfriend off at work and as I was about to leave, out of my peripherals, to the north I notice an object (what seemed to be ) entering our atmosphere at a downward 45 degree angle, then stopping about 2,000ft above a close island. It only took a second from when I noticed it until it had stopped then began moving west along the same horizontal height as where it has stopped it was at this time I started taking pictures, it took the object less then, I’d say 20 sec to travel from stopping point to out of sight. I leave roughly a straight distance of 20 mile from a navy air base and can take pictures of all sorts of military planes and government planes too, but no pictures will compare to this UFO.  Exactly 14 minutes later there became this grey streak where the UFO came down at an angle, and then the only way I can describe where the UFO stopped before moving west is a grey sonic boom looking cloud in just that spot though. Me, I am a very open minded person I see no reason why E.T.s can’t exist if we do, I have a good clue of air crafts not only because I lived near a military base for 20 years but I have also spent 2 ½ years in the military. I have noticed an increase in UFO activity in the last year or two.;48.5062;-122.6291
