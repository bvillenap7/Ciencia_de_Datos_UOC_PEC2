One friend said what is that. She described it as a long skinny star that blinked.  None of us could see it.  We kept telling her it was a cluster of stars or a sattlelight. But she said when it lit up, it was faded and if it were a cluster stars, why would they all blink? So I moved to her side of the hot tub and had her point out where it was in coordinance to the little dipper, and she said 12:00. Then the other girl and I saw it.  As soon as we all were saying that is weird, a big flash happend under it and went black. Kind of like someone throwing a blanket over it or like big wings;48.5062;-122.6291
