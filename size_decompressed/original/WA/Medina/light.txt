Light seen over Seattle/Mercer Island changes direction;2011-02-02 20:30:00;15 min;Light seen over Seattle/Mercer Island changes direction On Feb 2, 2011, at about 8:30pm, in Medina Washington, I was standing in the upstairs bedroom of my house, looking out the window facing South where I can see Lake Washington and Mercer Island.  Just above the trees of my neighbor's property, there was a bright white light traveling very slowly across the sky going East, at about a 30 degree angle. Then it reversed direction and went back the other way, traveling a little more quickly.  From my vantage point it seemed to reverse direction above the West end of Mercer Island.  It continued west over Seattle, sometimes getting even brighter, and then some trees obscured my view, and that was it. It was visible to me for about 10-15 minutes. As I watched the light, it seemed to sometimes have flashes of red and blue. As it was on it's path West toward Seattle, a plane inbound to SeaTac seemed to get quite close to it. The light was at a higher altitude than the inbound planes. This was the second time I saw this. The first time was last week, I think, around the same time in the evening. I found your site that night but I thought maybe I was mistaken, but the way it reversed direction stuck with me. So when I saw it again tonight, I called my mom upstairs to confirm I wasn't crazy, and we both witnessed it reversing direction. It could be a helicopter, but it didn't seem to turn, just reverse right in it's tracks.;47.6307;-122.2301
