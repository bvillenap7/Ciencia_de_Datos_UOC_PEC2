While getting ready for school, my twin sister got me to look in the sky to the south and a little west.  In the sky she should me a strange light shining through the clouds that looked like a reflector telescope, with a dark rounded off square with a dark line going toward one edge. The light was stationary as long as I was looking. I watched it as best as I could on my way to school on the buss. This happened in the summer at the begining of the school year, either in 1974 or in 1975. I think Skylab was orbiting back then.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
Light  flashed oddly and changed direction twice.;2002-08-02 22:30:00;2 min;Light  flashed oddly and changed direction twice. My husband and son and I were walking the dogs in the back yard last night at 10:30 and we usually keep an eye out for satellites weather permitting (see NASA J track 3D). We observed SPOT1 travelling in a northerly direction to the east of our house and saw a flash of light in a sotherly direction from our house, the light was travelling in a due south direction and changed course twice as is flashed irregularly and we lost sight when is went behind the trees travelling in a due south direction. only lasted a few minutes. my husband rechecked the NASA web site and noted that there were no other satellites over head at that time. Any Idea what it was?  We regularly watch for meteors and this was not one. And was way too high to be an aircraft.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582

My window was rolled down.  I turned to look just as this brilliant green light entered the clouds to my east at maybe a mile away and 2000' elevation.  The moon was bright through high haze, with lower level stagnant nimbostratus remnant clouds spaced by miles.  The surroundings were illuminated quite well, but the object lit up a considerable parcel of the cloud it went into in bright green light.  Object seemed to be going down into the cloud at a 15-degree angle.  A second after the light was gone it seemed like the object had gone down, judging from the angle of entry and speed.  It covered at least a mile in less than half a second - speed of sound speed, but there was no sound.  Too, from the time I left Maple Valley, to the sighting, then to Enumclaw, I easily passed a dozen law enforcement officers from various jurisdictions.  Some were parked (singles and doubles), some driving (saw three in a row coming around one corner)- an alarming degree of activity for that confined stretch/area.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
lights acting strangely;2003-09-20 20:55:00;5 to 7 min;lights acting strangely My son and I were out walking the dogs looking at the stars when we saw what we thought were satellites but they didn't act like satellites one of them was fairly bright and went straight up in the eastern portion of the sky stopped and came right back down in the opposite direction.  Then the other one was heading from the north to the south in the eastern portion of the sky and started to zig zag  stopped and then flashed and took of with a visible light trail behind it.  There was the last one a few seconds later that slowed down and flashed and disappeared completely.  what the heck did we see??????;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
Low, bright, fast white light traveling east / northeast on north maple valley border;2019-02-28 05:59:00;8-10 seconds;Low, bright, fast white light traveling east / northeast on north maple valley border I am a 51 year old - sober man - who has never seen a “ UFO “ before. I went outside to bring my dog in before leaving for work.  It was cold, mid to high 20’s. It was still dark. The sky was crystal clear. I do not wear / need corrective lenses.  I live in a quiet, dark, rural area.  A light in the sky (about 36 degrees up) caught my attention as I was facing straight north.  It was moving too fast, too low, and was too bright to be something (like a plane) that I could look away from.  My first view picked it up at approx. Maple Valley HWY 169 & Cedar Grove Road intersection (1.04 miles north of me).  It traveled from Cedar Grove/169 to the north side of Tiger Mountain in 8 to 10 seconds.  This is about a 5 mile distance in a straight line. 5 miles travel in let’s say 9 seconds = 2000 MPH.  This is why it caught my eye, and I couldn’t look away.  It had no craft shape that I could decipher.  It was simply a bright, round white light about the size of a quarter.  It had no trail.  No colored lights.  It did not make a sound.  It never wavered in altitude, and it appeared to travel in a straight line with the horizon until I lost  visual with it.  This may sound strange, but it traveled with a purpose. The best visual of the object I could give you was if you could grab a star from the sky and pull it down to about 6000 feet.  That’s exactly what it looked like. I’ve emailed a drawing showing how I came to my guess on the objects altitude.   I used the “Skyview” App to locate the objects approx. degree in height.  I looked at an area map and set a ruler on what I believed to be the line of travel.  If it had continued on its path over the North part of Tiger Mountain it would have passed very close over Fall City, WA.  It then would have looked to cross directly over the city of Carnation, WA.  I posted my experience on social media to see if anyone else in the area saw this object.  I have had no success so far.  I’m sharing this because it ! was not a plane, or a drone.  It was not a satellite.  It wasn’t! a meteo r, or a shooting star.  I’ve seen all of those things a million times.  I was just lucky yesterday morning.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
Star like lights descending in a pattern in the clear night sky. ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-21 05:00:00;5-10 minutes;Star like lights descending in a pattern in the clear night sky Looking Northeast about 2:00am in the clear nightsky I noticed a stream of stars that was a strange formation in a vertical arrangement which caught my attention. I looked closely and noticed they were actually moving in a vertical formation descending from above and down to the eastern horizon.  They were spaced apart but all moving at the same speed and equally distanced apart. There may have been a total of about 20 and as they descended downward from above another seemed to drop from the sky above.  This occurred within 5 to 10 minutes and after approximately 20 had repeated the descent there were no more. None of these lights left a trail like a meteor but the incident reminded me more of the Phoenix lights reported a few years ago.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
