I was driving on Maple Valley Highway approaching, from about 1/2 mile away or less, the crossroad of Kent Kangley road. This is the four-corners area in Maple Valley. My friend was driving in front of me. What I saw may be similar to that of a shooting star but struck me as being unusual as compared to such. It seemed fairly lower to the ground against the horizon than a shooting star would be and also seemed closer against the night sky background. My point being that it did not seem to be an object entering the atmosphere. From my viewpoint it came downward diagnally straight to the right. The Object resembled that of a medium sized star and the color shared a likeness of a star as well. The objects brightness remained constant so it did not get brighter or fade out. The object disappeared then reappeared briefly before disappearing again for the final time. I would compare it to a light turning off then on again. This off and on effect occured towerd the bottom of the objects decent or line of travel. It had no tail or streak whatsoever. The velocity was not as fast as that of a shooting star. It had a certain amount of velocity but it just seemed slower. My friend had seen it as well as he was driving in front of me. The sighting struck him as being out of the ordinary as well. We would have just said hey, did you see that shooting star? or something like that if it had appeared ordinary.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
A ROUND GOLF BALL SHAPED THING WITH MULTIPLE TWINKLING COLORS;2004-01-20 09:05:00;10 minutes;A ROUND GOLF BALL SHAPED THING WITH MULTIPLE TWINKLING COLORS It is a clear starry night in Maple Valley, Washington. I was at my computer and I could see something sparkley out the corner of my eye outside the window. It was multi-colored and twinkly. I got my binoculars and looked at it and it was a round golf ball-shaped thing with many colors moving around on it. I woke my husband up to come and look at it but when he came out on our deck to see it, it had moved backwards and he or I could not see the detail I could see only seconds earlier. It is still there right now but too far back to see the shape and detail now. It is in the eastern sky. I can still see the colors twinkling, but not the shape or detail. It was very beautiful but I can not imagine what it was and did not know who to contact about it.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
Larger slower shooting star like object that I can confirm  a situation  to research!;2011-08-19 00:44:00;5 seconds;larger slower shooting star like object that I can confirm  a situation  to research! Left side of moon, below about 2 inches from the moon when viewing from earth, I witnessed what appeared to be a shooting star at first until I realized it was slower & larger.  It alarmed me because it was so close to earth.  I am asking my friend to take me towards it in his helicopter to check it out being that I have only heard a woman heard a large boom near Spokane, WA. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke very briefly with this witness, and we encouraged her to try to get a photograph, and to arrange to have other witnesses look at the object.  PD));47.3845000000001;-122.0582
