Object with flashing colored lights on its underside hovers over home in Maple Valley for almost 1 minute.;1996-03-22 21:30:00;45 seconds;Object with flashing colored lights on its underside hovers over home in Maple Valley for almost 1 minute. In March of 1996 my husband & I just moved into our new home in Maple Valley.  Our living room faced north and the west wall of the living room was almost completely glass.  One night (either Mar 22 or 29) we were watching TV (Yes, The X Files - I was afraid to put that in, but it was the truth) on the couch next to the west wall and my husband calmly points to the window and says, What is that?  I looked and about 40 ft directly above our backyard was a horseshoe shaped object, just sitting in the air, with several flashing colored lights on its underside.  The object had a rounded edge above the lights all the way around the part we could see, and from there it more or less stair-stepped up to a conical structure with the point cut off.  We immediately shut off the TV to listen to it, but it made no sound.  It seemed as though it was staring at us (the lights in our living room were very low so we could easily see outside).  Suddenly it started to slowly rise (still making no sound)until it was about 150 ft above our house and then it moved so fast it basically disappeared shooting across the sky in a northeasterly direction.

after the incident was gone we  talked about it and really wondered what it really was;2004-06-04 18:00:00;3 minutes;after the incident was gone we  talked about it and really wondered what it really was Me and a friend were out on the Cedar River getting some sun. I was watching the cloud formations move over Cedar Mt. blocking the sun.  I was also watching planes before the clouds started moving in.  We were watching clouds forming faces ect.  We were just sitting back relaxing and I saw a dark dot south of us moving northeast.  As I watched it I  was trying to figure out what it was. As it got closer I was looking for  wings and thats when  I SAID TO MY friend I see no definition to it. By then it was getting closer. We could see something dark that looked like a squsished donut. It was oblong but not too long.  Then the horses, dogs, two loose goats, started acting up, the wind started blowing, a cottonwood branch fell and and all three of us felt strange after that.  The wind was blowing just a little north of west, at about 20 to 30 mph. It lasted 10 or 15 minutes.  We observed the object for 2 to 3 minutes but the time is hard for me to calculate, it could have been 5 min. We ran around a tree to look at it, because the tree leaves were starting to block our view.  Then we couldn't see it so we ran around the corral which took 6-9 sec.  Then there was nothing. no sign of it.  I stood there with 2 other people looking, wondering where it went.  One of the two witnesses started crying and her friend who did not see the object consoled her.  she was worried that something bad was going to happen.
