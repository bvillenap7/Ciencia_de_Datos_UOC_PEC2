Elongated object spotted over Maple Valley;2009-06-27 17:00:00;15 minutes;Elongated object spotted over Maple Valley I noticed a small white object very high in the sky that appeared to be stationary or moving slowly. Using my binoculars, it appeared to be elongated with a glow. My neighbors also spotted it and nobody could figure out what it was. It seemed to have contrast like two colors to it? It could have been space junk or satellite or even the space station but I wouldn't think you could spot any of those things in mid day. I live in Maple Valley and it was approximately North/Northeast between 25-45 degrees in the sky. Perfect viewing conditions, no clouds. I'm just wondering what it could be. Thank you for your time.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
Cylindrical Object with Flashing White Light is Stationary and then Quickly Disappears.;2020-04-25 20:27:00;6 minutes;Cylindrical Object with Flashing White Light is Stationary and then Quickly Disappears. On April 25th, 2020, I was on my porch facing west admiring the sunset at 8:27pm.  I noticed approximately 45 degrees above the Olympics and perhaps about 1 mile or so away (from my vantage point) a flashing light.  The light was white and flashed every second with a 2 flash burst approximately every 5 seconds or so. At first I just assumed it was a civilian aircraft headed in my direction but it was stationary.  I then assumed it was a helicopter.  But the light didn't seem to match any civilian navigation lighting pattern I was familiar with.  So I went inside and grabbed my binoculars.  With the binoculars I could just vaguely make out a cylindrical black object.  No tail or wing structure that I could discern. After a couple of minutes a civilian airplane came into view and when it did, this object started moving in a fairly quick pace to the North, and then switched course and started moving to the south.  It was still plainly in view this entire time.  At around 8:33pm this object suddenly moved very rapidly downward or at least out of my view and below the tree line where I lost all visual contact.  The flashing white light was no longer there, simply a small red light as it made its way out of view. I am a huge aviation buff and can recognize numerous commercial and civil aircraft.  This was none of those.  This was a true UFO.  It was Unidentified, Flying and some sort of physical Object.  It's possible (I cannot rule it out) it was a drone but I don't get that feeling.  It seemed to be larger than a drone.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
