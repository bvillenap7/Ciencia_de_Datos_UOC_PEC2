Super bright light, silent ,continuously ever 5 minutes .;2016-07-23 00:00:00;3 ish a.m;Super bright light , silent ,continuously ever 5 minutes . I just got off of work about 12ish and as soon as I got home I noticed a repetitive flash that was lighting up the whole sky .  It only last on second but changed brightness about 6 times per second if not more .  It was completey silent an didn't stop until about 3 . I starting search for answers an ended up driving on black diamond high way.  Out of no where a ring of fire apeared in the air this also was on a glimps of a eye but so bright an impossible to miss .  I was very glad that there was 4 other people with me that witnessed the same thing . Honestly you will never know the truth an this is the last time I speak I just seen a post before mine that saw the same silent electric high voltage of some sort .;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
