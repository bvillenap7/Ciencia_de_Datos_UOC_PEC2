My roommate called me outside to see what she saw, amidst all the fireworks, and we saw three red lights in separate parts of the sky, all heading south over Maple Valley, WA.   One of them appeared to be on fire.  The other two looked like bright red lights moving high above the fireworks.   We knew they weren't fireworks because they were moving southward independently of any fireworks and they kept on moving and their light never dissipated.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
