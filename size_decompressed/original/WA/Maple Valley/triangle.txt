Two separate triangles of light (one light per corner);2011-05-21 20:07:00;30-70 seconds;Two separate triangles of light (one light per corner) My daughter was outside with the dog when she ran through the door shouting at me to come outside. I did, and what I saw can only be described as two pairs of triangles of 3 floating yellow lights. They look orange in the picture, but that's because my camera was adjusted to the cloudy blue light of Western Washington sky.  My son came out too, but he was convinced it was some sort of flare system and went inside pretty quickly.  He wouldn't have thought that if he had seen the one pair slow down then speed up (not typical of a flare, which uses graduated release). He did have a point that there were only lights, though.  I, not being a very big believer in aliens, am pretty privy on cloaking and I know that it is nearly impossible to cloak emissions meant to propel an object relative to another object (in this case the ship would have been pushing against air).   My daughter pointed out that it had a watery look which I assume was the lensing effect a cloak might have.  Shortly after, my friend called up and asked me if I had seen the Lights in the sky and if my lights had flickered (which they hadn't). He, unfortunately, didn't have a camera near enough to catch a picture in time.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
