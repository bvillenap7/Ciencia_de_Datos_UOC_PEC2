I was outside on my deck with all the deck lights turned off so I could watch the sky and hopefully see some shooting stars while i was smoking my cig.  When to my left out of the corner of my eye i had seen a bright light shinning through the treetops.  I thought it might of just been a plane but then it had slowed down behind the trees. So i focused all my attention over to those tree tops when suddenly this bright sphere of yellowish white light came soaring out from the treetop line ...and this object was quiet! no sound what so ever as it flew fairly slow paced about a block or two of a distance then it was like someone or something had turned the power down in this thing and it just slowly dimmed as it continued to soar until it was the tiniest speck and just vanished!!!!   I was in complete shock while i was watching this take place in front of me i could not believe it!!  I have seen plenty of airplanes, shooting stars, meteor showers and satellites and t! his my friends was neither!!  It was almost like i had just seen this thing as it flew by zap out of this time back to where ever it came from!  I hope i was not the only person who seen it!;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
A silent pulsing orange circular glowing object.;2013-06-02 00:10:00;5 seconds;A silent pulsing orange circular glowing object I was out on my back deck when I noticed an orange color coming from behind the trees up in the sky.   I kept watching it and once it came out from behind the trees I could see this thing perfectly for about 5 seconds as it flew by with out any noise.   It eventually past my view of sight and behind some more trees.   What i did see felt like more then 5 seconds thats for sure, but it was a circular pure orange glow with an outter shell-like of a more transparent orange all the way around it as it had a heartbeat almost like a pulsating vibe to it.   It was the size of about a basket ball in the sky but it was far up there so it must of been huge up close!;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
