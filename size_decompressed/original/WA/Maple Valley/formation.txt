3 LIGHTS SEEN IN FORMATION ABOVE MAPLE VALLEY, WA. (USA) ON 12/3/00 @ 11:20PM.;2000-12-03 23:20:00;5 MINUTES;3 LIGHTS SEEN IN FORMATION ABOVE MAPLE VALLEY, WA. (USA) ON 12/3/00 @ 11:20PM. 3 BRIGHT LIGHTS WERE SEEN OVER MAPLE VALLEY, WA. @ APPROXIMATELY 11:20 PM ON 12/3/00. THE LIGHTS WERE IN FORMATION APPROXIMATELY 150 YARDS APART FROM ONE ANOTHER. (*<-150yds->*<-150yds->*)  THEY WERE VERY BRIGHT.  THE LIGHTS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A PARTICULAR BUSINESS OR LANDMARK AS I TAKE THIS DRIVE HOME EVERY NIGHT AFTER WORK.  IT WAS IN A SEMI-REMOTE AREA AND I OBSERVED THE LIGHT PATTERN FOR APPROX. 5 MIN.  THE LIGHTS WERE STILL FOR THE DURATION OF MY SIGTING UNTIL THE END WHERE THE FAR RIGHT LIGHT GRADUALLY LEFT FIRST.  BEING ONE WHO HAS SEEN MANY UFO SHOWS ETC., THIS PROBABLY DISCOUNTS ANY UFO AS THE LIGHTS DIDN'T TAKE OFF TOGETHER IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS IF IT WERE ONE SHIP.  THESE LIGHTS CLEARLY STOOD OUT AND DIDN'T BELONG THERE.  I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A REPORT TO SEE IF OTHERS MAY HAVE ALSO WITNESSED THEM PERHAPS LONGER IN DURATION.;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
