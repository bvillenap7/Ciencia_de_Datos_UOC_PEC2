strange lights make half diamond shape in sky and one approaches the house.;2010-01-29 00:00:00;all night and still conti;strange lights make half diamond shape in sky and one approaches the house. Well first of all please at least see the pictures I have a lot of them  this encounter may sound a little unusual but it did happen and I haven’t slept for 2 days taking pictures and preparing this report ha-ha because I’d really like some feedback on what these are and what I should do   It isn’t anything new however I have visited Mt. Rainier but it’s a disclosed location and I go to the sattva sanctuary at Mt. Adams where all are welcome to “sky fish” as we call it…   Anyway long story short because I have plenty of pictures…. I was outside in my backyard….and I noticed a light...the light turned orange within a few seconds and started to flare a bit then disappeared as a series of smaller white lights “kind of like smaller twinkling stars” started appearing and forming a quadrangle or half diamond shape. I knew then that I was dealing with the same lights I go far off into the woods to see….so I immediately grabbed a camera and started taking pictures  The small white flickering lights stayed in the sky for awhile as a couple slightly visible orbs or orb like entities started flying around the backyard….you could just see them but it was hard….so I started taking pictures…..and there were a lot more than expected….at one point I took a picture of my brother and it was terrifying what came back.  The largest orb “the one you could see visibly best” kept following me…I have the pictures he followed me right to the sliding glass door…then went over to the kitchen window and waited….I didn’t know what to do I mean it’s obviously an intelligent being…so I didn’t say anything out loud but I did say….you’re welcome inside come in and maybe try and interact?  Well sure enough it came flying through and another one behind it “I have pictures of all of this” a lot more came in than expected and sort of started just cruising around….but at one point they started building these holographic type structures…you could BARELY see them with your eye…but you could see them rather well with a big flash on your camera... All that happened after that is they made these beautiful elaborate transparent structures “I have pictures of all this” but then I noticed once they were finished….creatures started coming out…and not the friendly kind “I have pictures” some pretty scary looking and very strange things….it almost seemed like hologram like they were just manifested images not actual reality because some of the entities and creatures were just so different and unreal…  Anyway I still see a lot of orbs….no weird pictures of anymore creatures I just try and stay positive…my friend was saying they could be something called reptilians these evil aliens who are from another dimension…however these did seem like they could be either from another dimension or at least light spectrum…but I wasn’t too keen on the idea they seem pretty harmless….a little frightening at times….but harmless….I hope  If you have any further inquiries or would like to come visit infrared cameras REALLY help so does any type of night vision….I’ve been using a basic camera and I can see a couple orbs and other funny shaped light structures flying around almost every picture I take…I have about 300…don’t worry I won’t send them all…  Thanks for your time guys  This is not a joke either please at least look at the pictures before you think its all nonsense….thanks;47.3845000000001;-122.0582
