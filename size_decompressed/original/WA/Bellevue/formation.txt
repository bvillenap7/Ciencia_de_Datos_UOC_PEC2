I was lying down with a friend of mine watching the night sky when i saw what i thought was a jet airliner. Then I realized that the lights of the plane ,which were all orange, began to move independantly. What i mean by this is that they were changing formation in a very unusual manner. They were declerating then accelerating moving side to side and generally jaggering around. The thought of it being fire flies came to mind accept that what i saw was above a thin layer of clouds. I thought the possability of it being military air craft except that the G-Force from such violent manueverse would kill the pilot. The speed of these aircraft would seem to be extreme in relativity to my perception of the altitude of the craft.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
