Strange object floating above the Bellevue Mall;2000-11-08 12:20:00;5 minutes;Strange object floating above the Bellevue Mall On August 30, 2000 at about 12:25pm I noticed an interesting object slowly descending above the Bellevue Mall. From an upper floor in the Rainier Tower, I watched it descend moving slightly north-west over the next few minutes to just above the Bellevue Mall where it held stationary for a couple minutes. I have 8x23 binoculars in my office because of my view, so I was able to watch this object and see it in decent detail. The object looked like a large ballon in the shape of a butterfly, except that the wings of the butterfly were not part of the balloon, but attached to the sides. It was symmetrical, with wings on either side, and was very colorful, as you would expect a butterfly to be. I thought it was interesting that a balloon would descend from the sky, but I assumed it wasn't impossible. I was very surprised to see it start ascending, and headed slightly south-east, the same path from which it descended. This seemed strange for a balloon, to descend from high, stop close the the ground, and then begin ascending again. I know the time and date of the event because I took pictures of it with a Mavica digital camera which recorded the date and time. Unfortunately because the object was small and distant the only thing in the pictures is a gray blot. No detail to be seen. I can provide the pictures if necessary, but they really don't show much. I didn't think much of it until today (11/08/2000). Again, at about 12:20pm (this time I looked at the clock and did not take pictures) I noticed the same object above the Bellevue Mall. I looked at it through my binoculars and it appeared the same as I remembered the previous object. It descended slowly, heading north-west (note that the prevailing winds in the area are north-east, but it's a calm day) until it was below my line of sight (high in the Rainier Tower). I called a co-worker over and asked him to look at it. We then went to another office on our floor because we knew of a telescope we could use to image it better. Sadly, it's a crappy telescope and although I was able to track it for a while it didn't produce any better picture than the binoculars did. This time, instead of heading back up, it floated just above the tree line out over Medina and moved north slowly in between trees. I eventually lost it just south of NE 8th. I estimate the size to be beachball to basketball size, but it's hard to guage size from the distance from which I observed both events. Right now I'm watching several different helicopters flying above and around the Medina area. Helicopter traffic isn't unusual around here, but the timing is interesting to note. I've seen three thus far, two look like private, small helicopters and the other a larger news-chopper breed, but too far away to see any markings or color. All three have been flying up and down the east shoreline above Medina.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Fixed object passed overhead, silently and with no running lights, in clear night sky.;2001-10-03 20:15:00;2 seconds;Fixed object passed overhead, silently and with no running lights, in clear night sky. At approxamitely 20:15 on 10/3/01, I stepped out onto my back deck to have a cigarette.  I left the porch light off to observe the night sky.  After a few moments I observed an object travelling at a high speed, by far faster than any aircraft I have ever seen (Military or Civilian) towards the SE.  This object had no running lights, left no contrail and was completely silent.  It looked for all the world like the detached wings of a glider aircraft.  It was silhouetted clearly in the night sky because the sky was clear and there was an almost full moon in the Eastern sky, low in the horizon.  I observed this for approx. 2 seconds as it passed through at about 20-25 degrees overhead, disapearing behind a line of trees.  I have observed many unusual sights in the night sky but this is the first that has left me completely stumped.  The object size exceeded, by far, the diameter of the moon by about 1 and 1/2 times.  There was one other aircraft visible in the night sky, identifiable by it's running lights, travelling in a similar direction but apparantly oblivious to the object.  I came inside and phoned in the report and will be mailing a drawing to the reporting center. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and found him to be an unusually good witness.  The object moved across a large swath of sky at a very high (angular) velocity, and it had no visible lights on it.  PD));47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Hovering craft seen over Bellevue Washington;2006-11-27 16:45:00;aprox. 5 min;Hovering craft seen over Bellevue Washington My wife and I were driving home from work when she said, That airplane looks like it is going to crash.  When I looked up, it looked like at first it was a small plane duing a 45 degree turn.  We both noticed it was moving to slow to be a plane.  At that time it was difficult to see an exact shape.  It remined me of an old american car.  It moved slow,  and a  very even movement. It went around Downtown Bellevue and stoped. At that time I noticed a light coming from the front , like a spot light. It was at an aproxoite 35-40 degree angle. I looked at the shape, it was flat on the bottom, with a hump in the back and a hump in the front. Like I said an old American car. It just sat there, did not move. I put my window down and did not hear anything except cars. Then it started in what looked like a circular drive around the city, which is only a few blocks in either direction. This time it went around and never came back. I know it was not a plane. It was not a chopper, did not see any moving parts. It was twice as high as the tallest building in Bellevue, which is 44 stories. It seemed quite large like a big rig truck, but much thiner. It had at least one light on the back hump which was on all the time.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Bright Lights Over Bellevue, WA;2007-01-24 20:36:00;5 minutes;Bright Lights Over Bellevue, WA Tonight at approx 8:35 pm while driving West bound on I-90 from Issaquah, WA, to Bellevue, WA, (Factoria area) my son in the passenger seat noticed 2 bright golden lights in a northeasterly direction (over the West Lake Sammamish area, almost over Embassy Suite Hotel and Verizon buildings which are visible from the I-90 freeway).   Unable to look at the lights for a prolonged period of time while driving and so as not to alarm my son I initially thought the lights must be that of approaching planes landing gear.  As I continued to glance from the road to the sky to my right, I realized the lights were not moving, were very bright, and appeared to be over one another like a bright landing tower pole, only they were in mid air. The lights were very bright golden yellow in the center throughout and tipped on opposite ends in red, and were stationary non flashing lights.  The brightness of the light around the objects appeared to blur at the edges.  These lights appeared to resemble a long thin backwards K.  The lights appeared large in size, each K leg spanning approximately 30 to 50 feet and the lights appeared very low to the ground (less than ½ to one mile up in the sky.)   As I reached the Eastgate exit, the top light object began to lift up slightly, then appeared to tip completely sideways and disappeared in a northeast direction very quickly.  The object disappeared from view within 3 seconds.  The 2nd light object remained stationary.  As I made my way towards Factoria I pulled off into the Korean restaurant parking lot and faced the car northeast to better observe the remaining light.  By this time I had exhausted all logical possibilities, such as weather balloons, Boeing testing aircraft, or satellites, and had to admit to my son that I didn’t know what they were. My sons view was obstructed by the parking lot trees and so I decided to venture further toward Factoria as the road parallels the freeway all the way there.  As I reached the summit of 36th Street (near the Bellevue Community college over ramp) I pulled over and dialed 911 and gave the description of my observation to the dispatcher and they referred me to the National UFO Hotline.  I then dialed the hotline, (bear in mind the light object remained stationary during this entire time.)   Just as I began to relay my story to the hotline, the light object hovered straight up slowly, paused for a moment, then moved upward and left (imagine the pattern of left side of a Y in a broken movement).  The object then moved slowly in a western direction (parallel with us across the freeway) as I descended down into the Factoria area, where I then lost sight of it with the freeway above my head.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Two slow-moving very low altitude bright white lights about 20 feet apart undergoing rigid motion make a close approach.;2009-03-15 01:30:00;45 seconds;Two slow-moving very low altitude bright white lights about 20 feet apart undergoing rigid motion make a close approach. Time of Day: 1:30 AM to within about 30 minutes either way. Date: Don’t recall exactly. I will say mid-March 2009, but I could be off a month either way. It was mid to late winter or early spring of 2009. My location: Intersection of 108th AVE NE and NE 12th Place at the north edge of McCormick Park on the west side of 108th AVE NE in Bellevue, WA. NE 12th Place is a small dead end side street and not to be confused with NE 12th Street, which is immediately to the south. NE 12th Street is the boundary between urban downtown Bellevue to the south and the suburban/residential area to the north. McCormick Park is a very narrow park that runs on the north side of NE 12th Street between 106th Place NE and 112th Street NE. Weather: Very overcast. No wind. Dark, except for street lighting. Duration of observation: 40 to 45 seconds?   Circumstances/description:  I was walking my dog at about 1:30 in the morning. I had just crossed NE 12th Street on the west side of 108th AVE NE and had reached the north boundary of McCormick Park which abuts NE 12th Place.  I was about to turn west into the park when I looked north up 108th AVE NE and saw two steady (not flashing or strobing) bright white lights about 50 to 60 feet off the ground. These lights were about street width apart (I will say 20 feet -- 108th AVE NE is one lane in each direction there). They were apparently rigidly connected and moving right down the street in my direction. I will put their speed at 20 to 30 miles per hour, 35 tops. I sort of partially hid myself behind a tree next to the street and watched the lights come right down the street toward me (again about 50 to 60 feet up). There was absolutely no visible structure there of any kind, even though I was really squinting and trying to make something out. The lights were all I could see.  Furthermore, there was no sound of any kind. When the lights got to about 200 feet up the street, they started to turn to their left (my right). I figure they got within about 150 feet distance of me or less at closest approach – and I still could see nothing but the lights (although they did get dimmer as they started to turn and especially as they started to move away to the northeast). Only at the very closest approach did I hear any kind of sound at all, but I am not sure the sound was coming from what I was looking at. The location I was at is about a half a mile from I-405 and the traffic noise from that distance can be much louder than what I was hearing! at that point. It sounded possibly something like the engine of an ultralight, but exceedingly quiet. As the lights turned they briefly moved to the east perpendicular to 108th AVE NE and finally headed away to the northeast. At some point during this slow-speed maneuver, I did for a fraction of a second get the impression of a dim red light such as you might see in a dark room illuminating part of some possible structure, but it was much to fleeting to make out what I was seeing. Unusual features of object:   1)  Silent or virtually silent. 2)  Invisible, except for two bright white steady lights. 3)  Moved so slowly a conventional aircraft would have stalled.  It could have been a helicopter except for the first two items. I considered, an ultralight, but even an ultralight should have been much louder at closest approach, and even an ultralight would have stalled at that speed – and an invisible ultralight with bright lights 20 feet apart – not a chance. I even had a novel theory that I was seeing something tethered beneath a helicopter flying at a much higher altitude, which I did not see because I was preoccupied with what I was seeing in front of me.  My guess: my guess is that I was seeing (er – not seeing) some type of unmanned surveillance aircraft. I am thinking that if a craft did not have to take the weight of a pilot that it would be possible to construct something that would not stall at that speed. Also, there might not be much of a profile to see. There is still the issue that it was VERY quiet, whatever it was, and I still don’t understand why I couldn’t see any type of structure at all.  Note: there was one other person in the immediate vicinity who MIGHT also have seen this. Without going into details, he may have had even a much better view than I did, but I do not know who he is, and have no way of contacting him.

I looked at for awhile couldn figure out what it was and left it at that! It never really moved in its postiion in the sky druing the time I looked at it. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?

Students capture UFO shooting light beam on phone camera;2010-11-03 06:45:00;5 minutes;Students capture UFO shooting light beam on phone camera Saw one flying object that appeared to have a dome shape on the bottom, along with a triangular shape on the bottom as well. The top was shaded or turned away. It was hovering when I noticed it, so took out my phone camera to take a photo. It seemed to fire a beam of light twice, the second of which was captured in my photo. I took another picture as it was flying away. I did not hear any sounds coming from it.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Moon disappears for 4 minutes at 4:40 p.m. on 11/8/11;2011-11-08 16:40:00;4 minutes;Moon disappears for 4 minutes at 4:40 p.m. on 11/8/11 Just before event, I was on my back porch with binoculars viewing the full moon hanging low in the Eastern sky.  I turned to the west to view the sunset for a minute and when I turned back around the moon was gone.  The sky was clear - save for a few wispy clouds.  I was equally astonished to notice that the time was 4:40, and the date was 11-8-11, also significant as these are Cardinal numbers.  And it wasn't until 4:44 that I was able to identify the moon again.  The only explanation I can think of is that the asteroid blocked the moon from view.  Four years ago on 4/15 at 10:10 I filmed a waxing crescent moon which became partially obscured by a cigar shaped shadow (vertical) which began its trajectory in the center and moved up at an angle, exiting the tip of the north side of the waxing crescent.  George Noory reported that a small asteroid was a near miss.  Shortly thereafter NASA reported they were no longer allowing astronomers and universities to view incoming photographs from their satellite images simultaneously upon arrival.  I hope this information has been useful.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
