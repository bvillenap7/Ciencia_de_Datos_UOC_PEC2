Chevron-shaped object over Seattle/Bellevue;2006-10-20 18:30:00;1-2 minutes;Chevron-shaped object over Seattle/Bellevue Coming out of the house, facing SouthWest I observed an aircraft with a wingspan similiar to a 767, two white lights underneath.  It had no fuselage or tail. There were also no other lights, no strobes, nothing flashing as I'd normally expect to see.  I could see the setting sun reflecting underneath the metallic wing as it flew away from me in a generally SSW direction. It appeared to be 4-7 miles away from me.  I wondered if it weren't an aircraft.   A moment or two later, my question was answered when it went from flying level to a zero degree climb (straight up!).  It rose approximately 100-200 ft and dissappeared completely from view.   The sky was cloudless in that part of the sky.   I know of no aircraft that could make that maneuver without stalling and crashing, much less dissappearing like it did.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
