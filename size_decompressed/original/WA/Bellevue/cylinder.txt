The object appeared like a 1.5 inch section of sivery rod, about the same diameter as a slender ballpoint pen held at arm's length.  It was highly reflective, with no tail or wing structure, and no variation in the diameter of the rod.  It left no visible trail.  I heard nothing, perhaps because of driving with a dozen other nearby cars on I90. When I first noticed the rod, it was straight ahead and low in the sky.  The distance appeared to be about 1/2 mile.  It was climbing to my right at about 30 degrees.  Within 5 seconds I could no longer see it even though I leaned forward to look as high as I could through the windshield of my vehicle.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
