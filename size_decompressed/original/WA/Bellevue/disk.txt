I did not respond so she got me out of bed to show me this object in the sky throgh the den window. When she pointed at this object with her eyes and mouth wide open it had almost a hypnotic effect on you. Estimates on it's size are difficult but the main feature of this object was the different colors that consistenly evolved around it. There was red white yellow and i believe blue as well.I have two semi different recollections in terms of the shape of the object. One being flat as a pancake and the other changing as a larger craft as the evolving lights became larger. The movements of the lights could be compared to a light house or even a siren. We wathched the object for at least 15 minutes in complete amazment ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate source is anonymous.  PD));47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
The saucer hovered over us, it was huge, orange and silent.;1986-10-15 18:00:00;1/2 Hours;The saucer hovered over us, it was huge, orange and silent. October, 1986 about six PM, my daughter and I were driving to pick up my son from a Halloween party.  We lived on Yarrow Point, Bellevue WA USA. When we reached 92nd St and 40th we saw a space ship above us to the right. It was saucer shape but huge, the ship was very low hovering above us. We got out of the car and watched it as I couldn’t believe my eyes, the craft was hovering with no sound.  My daughter said, She thought we were watching it for a half an hour. I had to pick up my son so we left. We arrived back at the house about a half an hour later. (XXX XXth Ave NE Yarrow Point, Bellevue, WA USA.)   The ship was hovering and moving slowly over the Kirkland WA shoreline above Carillon Point on Lake Washington, heading towards downtown Kirkland WA. We could see the ship from our house.  My son also watched the ship over Kirkland WA. Don’t know why contact was made with the three of us, but it was, I am honored and I look forward to another visit.

Crown shaped craft over I-405 in Bellevue, WA early morning September 16, 2018.  ((NUFORC Note:  Reflection off of windshield??  PD));2018-09-16 05:30:00;25 seconds;Crown shaped craft over I 405 in Bellevue, WA, early morning September 16, 2018. I was driving southbound on I 405 through Bellevue, Washington, in September, when out of nowhere came this craft.  Flying in a southerly vector parallel to my direction of travel. My radio was on and traveling at highway speed there was no way to tell if the craft made any noise.  The craft appeared to look like a crown flying backwards, grey/black in color with many large white lights around the perimeter. I do have video which I will also attempt to send. I have never seen any footage of a craft remotely resembling what I saw on this morning. I work in aerospace and I understand the local flight paths for our local airstrips.  This craft was not on a typical trajectory for any of them. ((NUFORC Note:  Reflection off of windshield??  NUFORC and source of report agree that the object appears to be on the near side of the traffic signs, strongly suggesting that the object in the video provided is a reflection or lens flare.
