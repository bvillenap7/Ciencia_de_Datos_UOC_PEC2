It was large and white, no tail. This object was far larger than a shooting star, and they usually go across the sky, this was definitely going straight down to the earth. I am the owner of a small business in Bellevue, have a BA in Psychology from Cal State Hayward, CA, am 46 years old, and have never seen or reported anything like this before.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
White/green fireball falling slowly in vicinity of 405/520 interchange.;1998-09-23 22:50:00;3 seconds;White/green fireball falling slowly in vicinity of 405/520 interchange. 9/23/98, 22:50 hrs. Outside, while facing northwest of downtown Bellevue, WA a friend and I observed a white/green fireball drop from a high altitude then disappearing (not slowly burning out, but instantly turning off) roughly 200 feet before hitting the ground and before it disappeared behind any structure or treeline.  It fell at a rate faster than terminal velocity or any aircraft but nowhere close to that of any falling star that I or my friend had ever observed.  We observed it from a high altitude and it became brighter and larger the closer it got to the ground.  At the instance of its disappearance it was brighter than any firework, flare, or aircraft landing light and 1/4 the size of a full moon.  Distance was the most difficult to judge.  We estimate its distance 2 miles.  Seemingly falling into/towards Lake Washington.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
A CIRCULAR BALL OF LIGHT WITH NO TAIL! MOVING VERY FAST FROM ZENITH TO NORTHERN HORIZON.. TOO FAST FOR PLANE/ NO TAIL;2001-09-16 21:20:00;2-3 seconds;A CIRCULAR BALL OF LIGHT WITH NO TAIL! MOVING VERY FAST FROM ZENITH TO NORTHERN HORIZON.. TOO FAST FOR PLANE/ NO TAIL It was definitely on Sunday... either the sept 15th +/- a week (sorry I meant to write it down)  I was comming home from an evening service at Bellvue Unity on Sunday night 21:20 pm.   Driving do NOrthpast Eastgate and saw a ball of light in the sky that moved as fast as a meteore..but had no Tail at all!  It was just a circular ball of light.. it took 2-3 seconds to traverse from top of my windshield towards  the Northern Horizon. It was as big as a streetlight 2 blocks away..but was much much brighter and of course moving at tremendious velocity.  Again I'm sure this was not a meteore as it had no tail. I've seen a few fireballs that size and they ALWAYS have long glowing tails. Way to fast for any plane ..but no tail like a meteore. Very bright ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is an academician in Seattle.  He appears to be a reliable and credible observer.  We have changed the date here to 16SE01, which may be off by a week.  The witness will attempt to confirm the date.

Orange lights/balls over Tiger Mountain.;2012-06-02 21:00:00;3 minutes;Orange lights/balls over Tiger Mountain. Just before 9pm I looked out to Tiger Mountain in Issaquah Washington (I live in Bellevue but have a nice view of the Cascade mountains and the city of Issaquah over Lake Sammamish)to the east.  I witnessed 3 orange balls of light hovering over Tiger Mountain not in any specific formation but moving very slowly from side to side and up and down....again at a very deliberate pace.  I watched this for a minute or two when the orange light on the right side went dark and I could make out a dark object decending very slowly towards the mountain.  The other two lights just went away.  It was very dark by then but the image of the dark object decending very slowly caught my attention. I have lived here all my life and have never seen anything like this before and I am a skeptic.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Red and Green fireball in Washington;2017-07-29 21:55:00;10 seconds;Red and Green fireball in Washington A large glowing ball of flame, green and red, hurtled through the sky in a linear, due north direction.  Faded into the distance as a dim red star.  No sound. the size initially was from my location approximately the size of a pencil eraser.  Billowing fire as it traversed the sky.  Very likely a meteor.  The green color was quite spectacular.  Barium possibly?;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
