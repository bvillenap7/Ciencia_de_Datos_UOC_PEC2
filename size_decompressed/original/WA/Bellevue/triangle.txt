We were traveling southbound on 156th Ave SE towards the I-90 Eastgate exit.  I was in the passenger seat of the car, and turned to say something to my friend when this object caught my attention.  It was turning low over the trees about 300 feet away to the east (near the Mormon Temple) and the closest thing I could attribute it to was a miniaturized Stealth Fighter.  It couldn't have been more than 20 feet long, and it seemed incredibly thin ... no more than a few feet in depth.  I directed the driver's attention to it, and he caught a small glimpse of it as well.  It was headed towards Lake Sammamish, keeping low to the trees and I lost site of it after 10 seconds or so.  Not sure what I saw, but it was no bird and no aircraft I have ever seen.  Again, the only thing it reminded me of was a mini-Stealth Fighter.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Strange Triangular Lights Flying Over the Seattle Area;2000-08-01 07:30:00;3 minutes;Strange Triangular Lights Flying Over the Seattle Area I was driving to work in regular rush hour traffic, traveling West on Interstate-90.  It was a bright sunny day with the rising sun shining west towards Seattle and the Olympic Mountains.  Light was relfecting and it was beautiful. Approximately above Lake Washington, about the height of  traffic helicopters, I saw 3 lights moving East almost along the freeway.  They were moving steadily and seemingly average speed, but their shape was very long, with the apex of the triangle shape above 2 smaller white lights.  They appeared to be one object moving absolutely together.  I kept looking while I was driving, at first thinking it was a helicopter with smaller planes flying near it.  When I went around the overpass and looked back again, it had disappeared.  The top light was so bright, it almost blinded me.  It wasn't a blimp, a jet plane or a helicopter.  I was convinced I had seen a UFO and went to work as usual.  I told my coworker what I had thought, but did nothing else! I listened to the news that morning to see if anyone else had seen anything in the area.  Nothing. I slowed in the traffic to just look up and try to figure it out.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
fast large silent three amber rings triangle formation;2004-04-21 23:30:00;30 seconds;fast large silent three amber rings triangle formation Three glowing amber rings.  ...............................................................................................0....................................................................................0.0.................................................................................................. No light from the center of each ring.  Just the outer edge of the rings were glowing.  The object appeared to be twice as large as the three zeros on the screen.  All three rings were heading in the same speed and direction like an arrow moving North East across the clear night sky. It was hard to judge the distance.  but I would say that either the object was extremely large and very far away (like three football fields moving across the sky at 5000 feet) or the object was about the size of a b-1 bomber at a 1000 feet.  But there was no noise, none what so ever AND it traveled half the sky in about seven seconds.  I could not be a satelite becuase nothing that far away would be THAT BIG, THAT FAST, AND THAT MANMADE.  Not even a space station. if it was in the atmosphere then nothing big and that close could have made no sound, I mean there was silence.  There was know hiding the fact that it was there but it would not have been seen if I had not been lying down and looking up at the stars while I was outside.  It just went across the sky like it didnt care who saw it but it was not flaching out in bright lights or anything. If I had to say what type of vehicle it was, I would say that it was a tactical very secret unmanned military type aircraft.  It would be nice to think that it was aliens from another planet but I dont think that they would be that stand offish  if they were this close to us already.  I think that it is just a secret branch of the government playing with our tax dollars.   Why is it secret, becuase there would be too many people asking too many questions.  We cant even solve the problems that we have right now, let alone another whole batch of legal, moral and ethical issues.

This appeared to be a very large object, traveling at great speed, with no sound.;2005-02-24 20:02:00;15 to 20 Seconds;This appeared to be a very large object, traveling at great speed, with no sound. On the evening of 2/24/05 at exactly 20:02 ( we received a phone call at 20:03 so the time was exact) I was saying good bye to a business friend in front of my house in Bellevue, WA.  He had just unlocked his car so my eyes were diverted then I heard him say What the heck is that and so I looked up to where he pointed.  I first thought it might be a shooting star but then noticed that the object appeared to be  a line of stars or lights (maybe a comet).  When my eyes focused more closely I noticed that the lights were in the shape of a large V. The lights were of the same intensity as the stars around.  However the lights moved together at great speed and as one object.  There appeared to be four or five lights per side of the triangle.  When my eyes focused on moving object for a second or two, I then noticed that the object had to have great size and mass and was also moving at great speed.  The object was first observed at a nearly overhead position and moved from overhead to the east and into the dull hazed light of the full moon.  I will mention that the sky was completely clear and no clouds.  It was also a complete full moon.  The object moved east and faded into the moonlight within 10 to 15 seconds.  We were so excited.  I am 53 years old and a gemologist for over twenty six years.  My eyes are attuned to visual comparisons of light and color on a daily basis.  I know what I saw was not a common plane or object. I am certain that we saw something quite unusual and if not very lucky to view it when we did that it would be very hard to view on a normal basis.  This is because the object blended into the night sky so well and the lights that formed the object matched the starlight intensity exactly.  This object was built to be difficult to see.  I estimated that the object traveled over the Seattle area from vertical sighting to the East in 10 to 15 seconds so the entire time over Seattle area was no more than 45 seconds to a minute.  I also live where commercial jets do travel over my house from the south to north route.  The object was 4 to 6 jets in width on each side of the triangle.  That is to say at normal viewing it would take 8 to 12 commercial jets in  width to produce an object that was of the size of the triangle we saw.  Also the lights were white/whitish and NOT blinking green or red.  I do know what this was but I have seen satellites, but not from my house and these lights on the craft were much brighter.  The commercial jets that I see are commonly very easy to hear also.  This object produced no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe this gentleman called NUFORC on the evening of his sighting, and we did not have time to speak with him at length, because of the airing of the ABC program on UFO's on this date.  We will attempt to contact him;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
I saw a triangular shaped craft with bright lights hovering near the 405 freeway in Bellevue/Kirkland on June 15th, 2008 at 12:30 am.;2008-06-15 00:30:00;2 minutes;I saw a triangular shaped craft with bright lights hovering near the 405 freeway in Bellevue/Kirkland on June 15th, 2008 at 12:30 am. I was driving northbound on the 405 freeway entering Bellevue Washington with a friend at about 12:30 a.m. On Sunday, June 15th, 2008 when I first noticed something strange. I was about a mile away from the object and the first thing I noticed were bright lights in the sky. My first reaction was wondering why an aircraft would be flying so low near a city, from the distance I was at I couldn't tell the colors of the lights but I was also confused about why the lights of this aircraft were so bright, much brighter than airplane lights would be. As I got closer I could see it more clearly, I could see that there were bright lights on either end of something, at that point I wasn't close enough to tell the body of the aircraft, and the lights had a large light pink color in the middle with green, blue, purple, and yellow lights on the side that were not as large as the pinkish light, both ends had identical lights of equal size and brightness. The lights were flashing in a strange pattern that made no sense to me. The lights seemed to flashing in a nonsensical way, the lights were also very bright with very rich hues. As we were coming up to it we were looking straight on at it so I couldn't see a third light from our first vantage point, but I could see faint light coming down from the middle of the object. When we got close to it we could see that it was hovering, not exactly over the freeway but to the left of it a little bit, since I was in the driver seat I got a better look at it than the passenger did. The craft was moving very slowly and was hovering effortlessly, it didn't seem to have a destination, and it was moving slightly higher in the sky and to the left, but more so it seemed that it was just surveying things. The way it moved seemed very effortless and moved in a diagonal motion while going up. It was about 30 stories high above us and had it been flying in a city it would have ran into buildings. We drove under the object and this is when I looked up at it and saw perfectly that it was a large triangle with a dark circle underneath it and the lights on every corner of it. The color of the entire craft was grayish and the black circle stood out in contrast to it. The lights were equally large and bright with the same colors on each corner. The music in the car was off and the windows were down and we listened to see if we could hear any sound coming from it, but there was nothing, had it been a plane or a helicopter flying that low it would have been very loud, but there was no sound radiating from this. Everything about it was unlike anything I had ever seen, and the colors were strange hues that they were very hard to define. At the point when we drove under it we were leaving Bellevue and entering Kirkland and as we drove past it and away from it, it was still flying in relatively the same spot, give or take a few yards.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
2 connected, inverted black triangles drifting parallel to the ground at sunset;2015-04-17 17:45:00;1 minute;2 connected, inverted black triangles drifting parallel to the ground at sunset It was a beautiful sunset over the Olympic Mountains and the sun was just disappearing into the clouds, instead of over the mountains.   Then we saw quite clearly two small, connected, black inverted triangles drifting parallel to the ground, from North to South.  Were they round I would have thought them balloons, though they were also moving too steadily and horizontally to be balloons.  They were less than a mile away.   They disappeared behind the neighbor’s house.  I grabbed my camera and went to go see them when they would have popped out the other side given their trajectory, but they never emerged and we didn’t see them again.
