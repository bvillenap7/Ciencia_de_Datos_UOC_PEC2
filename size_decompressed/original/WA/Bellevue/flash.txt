Bright flashing light travels erratically in both pulsing pattern and trajectory for extended period;2010-08-29 12:35:00;over 20 minutes;Bright flashing light travels erratically in both pulsing pattern and trajectory for extended period I was scanning the sky using high quality 10x50 binoculars when I saw a stationary bright object flashing just north and slightly below the moon.  Within seconds it started heading down starting with a basic flashing pattern of 2 and 1, but then it changed along with its trajectory.  The light was extremely bright most of the time, and then it would dim-- the timing was very erratic, and it just darted about. It stayed in the vicinity of the moon and Jupiter for about 20 minutes and I finally went inside. With binoculars, you got the sense that whatever it was, it was trying to get attention, as anyone scanning the sky with equipment at that time could not have missed it. It could not, however be seen by the naked eye.  Before I went inside, I saw a perfect rectangle cloud directly overhead.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Flashes over my house.;2016-12-24 01:00:00;6 hours;Flashes over my house. Over hour's worth of time, anywhere from 15-25 minutes apart, three consecutive flashes appeared outside my house 8 times throughout the night.  It was  as though lightning had struck, but without thunder or a rumble of dispersing electricity from said flash.  I watched for them after every of the three flashes that would go off, waiting for the time amounted until i saw it was directed at me from the sky.  Or at least that's what it looked like.  It is foggy and cloud filled skies at this time of 7am now.  I haven't SEEN a UFO per say, as though the flashes came from thin air.  But i did notice it (the flashes) were relatively close to being probably 30ft to 60ft diagonally from my window into the sky that I could see into, but not seeing any occupants inhabiting the skies.  The air feels frizzy and my blanket is shocking me fore i think it is because of these paranormal flashes.  This is my report.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556

I saw 3 incredibly intense white flashes in the sky moving in a Southeasterly direction.  They were a series as if they were from a moving object- but I couldn't make out a solid object in the sky.  I wish I could have turned around and followed them to get a better look.  I've never seen anything like it.  It was unnerving.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
