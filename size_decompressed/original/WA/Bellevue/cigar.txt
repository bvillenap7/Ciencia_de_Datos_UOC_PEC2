We also noticed that not one other car-people even was aware of us three jumping up down outside of our car. It was almost like for that moment time stood still. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

While filming the crescent moon, I noticed a cigar shaped shadow about 1/4 of the way down creep up and out of sight.;2009-04-26 22:15:00;1 min;While filming the crescent moon, I noticed a cigar shaped shadow about 1/4 of the way down creep up and out of sight. Yesterday as I was filming non-passenger planes that seemed to be swarming about. I noticed the crescent moon, and filmed it for about 20 seconds, commenting on its beauty. Then a plane went by and I followed it with my camcorder. About three minutes later I wanted to get a better look at the moon, so I focused on it a second time, from the exact location. This time the crescent had a shadow about a 1/4 the way down from the right of the top, and it was moving! This shadow covered the entire area of the crescent, as if someone had taken a magic marker and drew a line through that section. For a second I thought maybe I didn't have a clear view, and that there was a nearby tree or something that was causing the shadow, so I pulled the camcorder away and verified that I had a clear view with no impediments. In those few seconds, the shadow had drifted upwards, and was moving quickly. I filmed it advancing until it was out of sight-- it was the exact color as the space around it, so I'm not sure if the shadow was coming from below Earth and causing it, or the object was moving in front of the moon. Either way, it had to have been pretty large to cover that much of the moon. Within seconds of the shadow disappearing, I immediately noticed an unusually large number of aircraft around the moon, moving west to east, as if they were observing something. In ten minutes, I saw seven planes all on the right side of the moon where I had seen the cigar shaped shadow, and filmed two. While the sky had been relatively clear, when I went outside 40 minutes later, there was total cloud cover. I recall that at 21:00 I had filmed a couple planes that were emitting chemtrails, that I could barely make out due to the waning light. These trails were expanding into clouds. I filmed until 22:30, when I ran out of tape. Then at 23:00 I went outside with a new tape, and there was total cloud cover. For the next few hours I proceeded to listen to jets overhead until I fell asleep. I wanted to ad that the phenomena of planes making chem-trails which expand into total cloud cover had become so commonplace I don't bother filming it any longer. These planes are very well camoflauged, but they're noisy. They are two types but they follow the general description of having two engines, but the trail is emitted from the tail of the plane. It looks almost curly cue as it billows out of the end. In my opinion, some of these planes are spraying for moths and other perceived nuisance insects, and the other ones that are more camoflauged are producing convenient cloud cover for the passage of military planes. As I type this I am listening to the constant hum of jet engines, and there is total cloud cover in Bellevue this morning. Last week Monday it was clear and sunny at this time of the day, and apart from a passenger jet ever 7-10 minutes or so, there was not this activity.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556

It went out of my line of sight very quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
