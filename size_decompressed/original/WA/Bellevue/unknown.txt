High Tech Survelliance or Millionare seen High Above Bellevue, WA;2004-09-25 17:45:00;15 MInutes;High Tech Survelliance or Millionare seen High Above Bellevue, WA Looked up in the sky near the mall in Bellevue, WA.  Facing SE at a 60 degree angle to what looked to be around 5000-10,000 feet was a little white dot in the middle of some cirrus clouds.  It was out of place.  I took my Canon A80 digital camera which has a 11x digital zoom and snapped some pictures at full zoom.  They are blurry at best but do show the metallic coloring.  I then looked at the craft with a pair of cheap binoculars I have in my car.  I was able to make out 3 things.  First of all the Craft consisted of three parts.  The top was an indescriminate shape, neither round, nor square, but has mass like a crumpled up bunch of aluminum foil.  The second part in the middle was square and segmented like 4 or 6 silver lady fingers.  There then was a silver line going down a hundred feet or so, and I couldn't see what was hanging on it but it was a small white dot. It hung in the air for around 10 minutes and then when I came outside from a store 5 minutes later it was completely gone.  If I had to say what it was my first impression would be a long distance travelling ballon, like the ones millionares use when they try to travel around the world.  But the top of the craft had no distinctive sphere shape and was not at all like that.  Perhaps it was a survelliance craft of some sort?   There were some aircraft in the air, just passenger jets and they seemed below this craft, and they were very small themselves.  I am posting hyperlinks to the images I took along with a sketch.  Warning, these are large files, approximately 1 meg in size!! The movie is 3.2 megs!! Please note that the sketch is what I was able to view through my binoculars.

2 very fast, gliding objects moving southbound over the Seattle area.;2005-08-20 12:30:00;30 seconds;2 very fast, gliding objects moving southbound over the Seattle area. We were driving in South Bellevue near I-90, and saw two objects in the air flying southbound in the distance approximately over Seattle.  They were flying single file, one behind the other.  They did not appear to be any kind of aircraft they were moving very fast, and they seemed almost to glide.  They were too far to get a good description but they definitely did not look or move like aircraft, not even military. I'd never seen anything like it before!   They appeared to be moving south or southwest, away from us - we were beginning to go northbound into Bellevue so we only had visual for a few seconds.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
I say a rectangular shape in the sky.;2006-08-15 00:00:00;4 to 5 seconds;I say a rectangular shape in the sky. 3/20/2007 Hello, What I saw was not an actual spacecraft.  It was, and looked liked like, a window or rectangle floating above the north end of Seattle, WA.  I was on the east side of Lake Washington driving west across an over ramp from I-405.  It seemed visible enough that this would have been reported on the news.  I heard nothing about it.  Therefore, I chalked it up as something unusual but since no one else saw it, it would be like talking to a brick wall if I tried to explain to anyone what I saw. However, later I talked to someone that saw the same thing quite a few years prior.  It isn’t really anything fantastic enough to report so we both just left it alone. I lost sight of the one I was looking at because of traffic behind me and no place to pull over for a longer look.  But it was there, just sitting in the sky and not moving. It had definite rectangular shaped perimeter to it and from I saw there was clear sky looking through the inside of the rectangle. Has this type of event ever been reported before?  After reading a sighting by Col. Phillip Corso he mentioned he saw a UFO fly straight up from the ground and through a rectangular opening in the sky and it was gone.  He reported this while on active duty in the army. ((name deleted));47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Disappearance of object and vapor trail;2009-07-15 13:30:00;seconds;Disappearance of object and vapor trail About 13:30 hrs on July 15th 09, I was sitting on my deck reading a book facing south.  My upper body was at a 45 degree angle.  When I went to turn the page I briefly looked up and saw an object pulling a very large vapor trail behind it.  The only reason I started to watch the object was because the object seemed to be traveling faster than a jet would at such a high altitude.  I know that means nothing unless I knew the exact altitude.  But, that’s not my story..as it moved north it passed in front of the sun so I put my hand up to protect my eyes and waited for it to emerge from the other side of the sun.  It never reappeared.  Then, I looked back at the vapor trail and it was gone.  I watched a vapor trail today  ,07/17/09, that was in approximately the same spot at the same time and it just floated away in the upper atmosphere wind. It didn’t vaporized, just floated away. Whereas the one I saw the day before just vanished within maybe a few seconds. I know this is not very exciting but thought I would report it in case you are trying to accumulate sightings to use as fodder at some future congressional hearing.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
silent, slow airborn globe that accelerated suddenly and straight upwards, without a sound;2010-09-04 22:10:00;2-3 min;silent, slow airborn globe that accelerated suddenly and straight upwards, without a sound Completely silent.  Large, slow moving orange globe.  Slowly moving towards my car. Very steady, altitude unable to determine.  There were low clouds and high clouds and wind.  Object was sometimes behind low clouds.  Object glowed, did not have light beam as helicopter or plane.  I stopped my engine, no other cars present.  Absolutely no sound.  I decided to follow.  Object was at the corner of 156th Ave SE and 16th St SE in Bellevue Wa. It turned north near 156th.  I was reaching for my keys when it immediately and extremely fast, moved north and straight up.  It went from what appeared to be a slow cruise to an unbelievable rate of acceleration.  There was no sound.  That is all I can tell you. I hope there was someone else who reported this.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Three objects observed during Bellevue 4th of July fireworks display 2016.;2016-07-04 22:20:00;15 minutes;Three objects observed during Bellevue 4th of July fireworks display 2016. Three objects observed during community fireworks display at downtown park with about 20,000 people in attendance.  The fireworks display was towards the North of park, looking over to the East I seen a pair of green blinking lights just at edge of cloud ceiling (appeared to be hiding within clouds) was moving toward park.  At first I though it was small plane, but then it stopped and was in a stationary position for about 2-minutes after which it flashed a row of red and then a row of yellow lights, alternating quickly back and forth between the two colors for a couple of seconds before returning to two blinking green lights.  Then the object started moving slowly towards the South, and a second later it started traveling at the speed of a military jet, then slowed down to a stop just above the horizon from my point of view.   I then seen another pair of similar green lights flashing just inside the clouds above the crowd that was watching the fireworks, most! people seemed to be paying attention to the fireworks and might not have noticed the objects, or if they did they may have thought they were planes.  The second object was stationed over the park in the clouds, the first object then came back towards the fireworks area and became stationary within the clouds, then a third object with a pair of solid red lights at of front with flashing green lights at rear appeared just south of the park and was stationary just below cloud level through out the fireworks display.  It was interesting to see all three objects floating in the sky as if enjoying the fireworks.  The two object closest to the fireworks display would move slowly then stop and move again from one side of the display to the other etc.  The third object to the south remained in a stationary position throughout.  The objects seem to be communicating by flashing their lights, the blinking lights were not constant, but seemed Morse code like.  After the fireworks displ! ay, one object moved out towards the East and out of sight, an! d one mo ved out of sight toward the south then returned and appeared near another fireworks display five miles away wrapping up over Seattle where it stopped and sat for a minute, then quickly flashed alternating rows of red and yellow lights then resumed to flashing green lights and took off to the south at military jet speed.  I do not know when the object with the solid pair of red lights left after the fireworks display were over because I wasn't paying attention to it at the time.  There were no helicopter, jet or plane sounds during the event.  I ruled out local drones because of the altitude and speed of the objects.  They flew faster then a helicopter and local plane, traveling my guess would be, about a mile a second.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Fast meteor.;2016-09-04 01:00:00;2 seconds;Fast meteor At 1 am, I saw a very fast white object traveling from the north to the south south east. The event lasted perhaps 2 to 3 seconds. The speed was very very fast and the distance was roughly 30% of the identifiable horizon from My location. The size of the object was roughly 2-3 mm at arms reach, and roughly 30 - 40 degrees above horizon From my location looking east. No noise .;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Sound only, mechanical/celestial in nature, consistent, indoors.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-09 00:00:00;20 minutes;Sound only, mechanical/celestial in nature, consistent, indoors. Not a sighting.  Only sound.  Inside home - slider door open, house backs up to wetland/forest.  Sound volume was between a conversational voice volume and a whisper.  It was 'machine-like' but undulated.  It was extremely rhythmic and consistent in volume.   It started close and very slowly moved from bedroom to hall and to living area and down stairs to daylight basement (with no obvious exit) until it finally disappeared.  No possible chance of 'dreaming' - I was sitting up and fully awake but dared not make a sound.  'Height' of sound off the floor stayed consistent.  Sound did vary at one point as it moved away.  It was not seen.  There was no change in odor or temperature.  It sounds stereo-typically like an alien humming that you might see in a movie.  There was no light emitted.    The sound implied a size like a bowling ball.  It made no noise on the hard wood floors as it moved away.  It could be distinctly heard for more than 5 minutes.  It moved very slowly.   Nothing like this has been heard by me ever before.   Weather outside is a dense fog. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
