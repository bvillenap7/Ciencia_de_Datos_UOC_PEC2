Close encounter,;1992-08-01 23:00:00;30 Seconds;Close encounter, My friends and I were sitting out in the back yard on our sport court when a light from above came down onto us.  Thinking it was a flashlight from the house, I called out for my mother but to my surprise the beam of light was coming from farther away and was now moving directly onto our circle where we were sitting.  I screamed out LOOK! and all my friends but one or two said they saw what I did.  I saw a circular object flying about 300-500 yards up in the air through the trees.  The middle point where the light was coming from looked like a huge strobe light and then there were two opposite rotating rings of cilindrical shaped lights that would change colors individually like a fibre-optic light.  On the outside of the craft I witnessed viewing windows not much unlike those from an commercial aircraft, except a lot bigger. After I pointed upwards the craft mysteriously disappeared vanishing withou leaving a tracer of light or any sound.  Which leads me to believe that the craft shot straight up into space.  I know it sounds like we were all under the influence but no, It was before I or my friends even did that stuff.  In the papers the next morning it read that there was a ufo sighted over bellevue last night and that 50 people other than ourselves reported it.  The Government or Officials said it was Strobe ligths reflecting off swamp gas, what ever! Believe what you want, My friends and I know the truth is out there. This all happened at the address listed ((address deleted))  Ave NE ballevue Wa 98005;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Bright light went vertical and disappeared;1999-06-01 00:05:00;3 seconds;Bright light went vertical and disappeared Just after midnight under widely scattered clouds a driver of a truck that I was working on brought to my attention a very bright white light that suddenly went vertically until vanishing.  The light was as big your fingers at arms length about 1/4 apart to start with.  I would estimate it to have been in the area of the Keyport Trident sub base.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Bright white light going north to south;1999-10-08 19:45:00;7sec;Bright white light going north to south I saw a bright white light going north to south over Lake Sammamish on Oct 8th at approx 7:45 pm. It was seen for about 7 seconds. It seemed to hesitate twice. I could view about 10 miles of the sky where it was seen.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
small white circles that fade in and out and remain motionless for minutes at a time;2001-01-01 07:30:00;ten minutes;small white circles that fade in and out and remain motionless for minutes at a time We were watching the east horizon to see the sun rise, on a beautifully clear day. I noticed a white speck over the Cascade mountain range slowly fade into vision. It was small, very far away but a definate circular shaped object that remained motionless for about 3 or 4 minutes. It did not change shape,color, or size. It faded slowly back out of vision, and as it did so, another one the same way as before faded in and remained motionless for a few minutes, then faded out. I saw another one faintly do the same thing after that. It was much smaller, but followed the same pattern. ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing contrails by commercial jet aircraft approaching from the east.  PD));47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
3 hovering lights above Lake Washington;2001-02-01 05:45:00;1 hour;3 hovering lights above Lake Washington after driving around Bellevue for awhile, we stopped on top of Somerset hill and were checking out the view. IT was about 5:45am. We look out over lake Washington and hanging in the air are 3 bright lights in a triangle. They just hovered there, not moving for about 5 minutes or so. Then the lower left one started to move off towards Tukwilla, couple minutes later the top one moved off and then finally the third one moved off, all pretty slow and very smooth, not like hellicopters.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556

Extremely fast blue-ringed circle seen flying by Bellevue.;2005-05-20 22:29:00;3 seconds;Extremely fast blue-ringed circle seen flying by Bellevue. I was with my father as we exited our car, he grabbed my shoulder and turned me around.  A circular object flew off into the west. It seemed to be bordered by a blue ring and a red light was noticed underneath it. It appeared to be traveling at an extreme speed, with no sound. Much more speed than any jet that I know of. It was seen for very little time, no more that 3 seconds.  It could also have NOT been a comet, as it was much too large and the light from the city would have blocked most stars and comets anyways.  There were no aircraft in the vicinity either.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556

Solid light moving West to East, then abruptly disappearing.;2017-07-31 23:17:00;2 minutes;Solid light moving West to East then abruptly dussaoearing I just saw something odd in the sky.  Full disclosure:  Current beer count: 1.5. A light came from the West. One solid, bright white/yellow light. At first I thought it was a satellite but it was kind of too bright to be a satellite.  Moved faster than a plane, but higher than a plane and lower than a satellite. It headed East. But as it progressed East, instead of going lower in the horizon as if it actually headed East, appeared to gain altitude then abruptly disappeared far sooner than it should have.  Zero blinking navigation lights just one light. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably the ISS.
