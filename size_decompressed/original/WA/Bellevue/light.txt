Orange light seen in Northeast sky moving slowly upward, then stopping and then moving to right (south) - approx altitude 25,000 feet;1999-01-03 08:45:00;4-5 min.;Orange light seen in Northeast sky moving slowly upward, then stopping and then moving to right (south) - approx altitude 25,000 feet My wife and I walked out our front door toward our car and I immediately noticed a bright orange light to the right and slightly downward from the moon in the Northeastern sky. The unusual color caused us to watch closely as it moved slowly upward, stopped for about 45 seconds, and then moved slowly to right (south). There was cloud cover which had clear areas. The light appeared to be above the clouds. At first we assumed it was a plane or helicopter, but the movement of the light was not consistent as we would expect of an airplane and the orange color seemed unusual. It moved to the right (south) until it was directly eastward from us. Although the brightness had been steady at first, at this point it seemed to wax and wane although not necessarily in correlation with the breaks in the clouds. The light then disappeared and although we watched for it for several more minutes it did not appear again. Several times I thought I saw a smaller white light leave the orange light going in a southerly direction for a short distance although it was very dim because of the distance. There was never any sound that we could associate with the light as might be expected in the case of a jet passing overhead. Shortly after the light disappeared, a small light plane passed over coming from the north and flying toward the area where the light had disappeared. This may have been entirely coincidental as we do have fairly regular air traffic flying overhead.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556

I work in Bellevue Washington from 10PM to 10AM nightly. Tonight I went outside for a cigarette at 4:30AM PST. I was looking due east from the roof of the US WEST building on NE 4th street in Bellevue, and I noticed a very bright light in the sky. At first I thought it was an aircraft with landing lights on heading for Sea-Tac Airport. But after watching it for 10 minutes, I realized it was not moving, and there where no other lights with it (i.e. red or green flashing lights, which would indicate some sort of aircraft). This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this. I thought that someone should know.

At 11:50 PM on March 13, 2001 I saw a fast moving, bright orange light traveling south to north.;2001-03-13 23:50:00;less than 10 seconds;At 11:50 PM on March 13, 2001 I saw a fast moving, bright orange light traveling south to north. At about 11:50 PM on March 13, 2001 I saw a bright orange light traveling south to north. I live in South Bellevue, Washington. I had just stepped outside to take one of my dogs out before going to bed. As I stepped off the porch in the back yard I looked back, over the roof of my house, to the West. There I first saw the bright orange light. It was due west when I first caught sight of it.  There were a number of trees blocking my view, yet I could see that it traveled at a very high rate of speed.  It moved quite a bit faster than any plane I had ever seen.  I would say it took about 5 seconds to travel from where I first saw it to the west until it disappeared from my view to the North.  I would say it was around 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon.  There was no sound nor was there any trail of sparks. It appeared to travel straight and level. I wrote down notes about the sighting the next day. I didn't know what to do about it at the time. Then a few days ago I saw your program on the local cable access channel.  I copied down the URL for the web site and decided I should report it.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
WE HAVE VIDEO TAPE OF IT!  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable twinkling stars, we suspect.  PD));2003-09-28 22:00:00;couple hours;WE HAVE VIDEO TAPE OF IT! My husband first noticed it when he went outside to have a cigarette.  it was at first 1 big light and then 2 dancing around it, but then a helicopter or someothing came near the area and the lights disappeared.  So then we came out to watch it and at first the light was really visible and seemed like it was moving slowly to the right and the left for awhile and then would remain stationary.  When veiwing it through the binoculars or video camera it would just bebop all around the screen even though the camera was steady.  we watched this for about 4 hours.  The video tape is amazing.  we have the object changing colors from green to red to blue and then all of a sudden stretched out and then disappears into a cresent shape and then it took a couple minutes to find it again.  then it was back doing the same thing again.

White and very bright red lights seen in Bellevue WA.;2008-06-14 00:36:00;10min;White and very bright red lights seen in Bellevue WA. I was driving east-bound on I-90 from Seattle.  When I was on the Mercer Island floating bridge, I noticed a low-flying object flying away from me toward Bellevue.  It had one small white light on top, and a very bright red light flashing on the bottom.   It was moving slowly like a helicopter and in a straight trajectory.  It didn't look like any helicopter I had ever seen, however.   It continued for about 8 minutes and then slowly descended in a northeasterly direction until it disappeared from view.   It is possible that it was a conventional craft with enhanced landing lights, but it appeared to behave strangely and I couldn't identify it for certain.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Bright, light object moving in circular, zigzag and linear motions across sky.;2008-07-02 23:30:00;45 min.;Bright, light object moving in circular, zigzag and linear motions across sky. At approximately 11:30pm Pacific Standard Time, my son and I were watching a lightning show, east of Bellevue, over the Cascade Mountains.  Lying on our hammock, looking up, we noticed a light that appeared to be a bright satellite, but not moving in an orbit like direction.  Instead, the light, the brightest in the sky, was moving in different patterns, linear and in a zigzag motion.  A couple of times it moved in a clock, and counter-clockwise circular motion. The light appeared to change color from time to time.  Fixing our eyes on nearby stars, the distance of the object was vividly increasing and decreasing its distance to those stars.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
one sighting, possibly sattellite.;2008-08-14 03:00:00;2 Minutes;one sighting, possibly sattellite. Greetings Peter Best of luck with your campaign for state legislature.  Rather you than I, heh heh!   Just as I was bemoaning the absence of aerial phenomena, just may have observed a beautiful (possibly not a satellite) light sphere proceeding casually across the clear night sky.  That's about it really.  May have observed another although I really dont remember specifically, could have imagined it, or maybe it was a satellite.   Read your news about the ignorant, foul moutheed young Americans that prank call NUFORC (50% to 90%.)   Yeah, that is disappointing and I thought fascist attempts at humour were no longer trendy, guess they're behind the times as usual.  It's the lack of education and the maleducation.  They're not all that way.   Is UFO's Northwest a commendable website?   Keep me posted.   Say, what happened to the Perseid Meteor showers this year, only saw a few, unlike last year.   Please consider initiating an astronomical observatory at NUFORC.  I would gladly donate to such a venture. Also (Wikipedia entry) consider planting Jatropha shrubs the best biofuel crop to power NUFORC.  Thanx, ((name deleted));47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Three bright lights in formation hovered, then moved slowly northweast and disappeared through the trees.;2008-12-16 18:45:00;2 minutes;Three bright lights in formation hovered, then moved slowly northweast and disappeared through the trees. I watch the sky frequently and understand flight patterns from SeaTac, so I know when something's askew.  Tonight I watched three very bright white lights in formation hover above Lake Washington and travel very slowly northeast, which was not the prevailing flight pattern I had been watching today.   While I watched with binoculars, there was a red light in the middle that flashed intermittently, and I never saw any green light, even though the craft was relatively close, not more than 10 miles away.  I kept waiting for the white lights to break apart, as I've seen in videos and while they never did, the snail-pace speed and the behavior of this UFO was unlike the airplanes I have been watching and filming. I also realized that I had not been able to get a good look at any of the planes tonight due to the cloud cover, while this craft was seen clearly.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Moon highlights wide mass expanse traversing west to east at an even pace;2010-07-29 01:30:00;40 minutes;Moon highlights wide mass expanse traversing west to east at an even pace Around 1 a.m. I went outside to observe the bright moon and immediately noticed what appeared to be a wide ray of light just west of the moon, spanning the entire sky north and south, but as I continued to observe this phenomena I realized it was creeping across the sky and actually moving at a deliberate pace east. As I watched, it was obvious that the moon was illuminating whatever it was -- (like a gas or some type of energy?) and not headlights from a plane or jet plumage.  As I continued to investigate, it slowly -- and at a deliberate and even pace - traversed east across the moon. I got the sense I was witnessing something quite unique and even though it sounds mundane as I type this, it was truly awesome as it stretched as far north and south as the eye could see.  It was geometrically perfect, narrowing at both ends.  If I had to guess at what it might be, I could only say that I believe it was a deliberate mass of something that had a specific purpose. As it arrived close to the moon and was about to cross it, I could determine it was approximately twice as wide as the moon, and as it traveled east and away from the moon, it got dimmer until I could no longer make out the outline. NOTE: I am a frequent sky watcher, C2C listener and have observed (and filmed) many unexplained phenomena and I have never seen anything like this before.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Blue light swaying and dipping over Bellevue;2010-08-22 22:25:00;5 min;Blue light swaying and dipping over Bellevue I was at 5157 Lakemont Blvd SE Bellevue, Washington, 98006 from aprox. 2150 until 2250.   I noticed a blue light in the sky, just above the horizon, at about 2225.  It was hovering just above the tree line about 5 degrees to the east of the north star.  The blueness is what caught my attention.  Very soon after noticing it, it began to dip and sway and swirl like nothing I've ever seen.   I got the attention of another patron at the store and asked him if he saw it too.  He said he saw it, but didn't seem too impressed. It slowly dropped below the tree line and I didn't see it again.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Man witnesses 7 or 8 unidentified lights move rapidly overhead.;2011-06-14 22:00:00;1 minute;Belmont Conditions:  No precipitation.  Excellent visibility.  Moderately-high cloud ceiling. What/where:  Driving, I entered the I-405 freeway on-ramp at SE 112th st in Bellevue, WA, north bound, and saw approximately 7 or 8 lights, traveling southbound over Mercer Island, in what looked like a holding pattern for aircraft.   I pulled off to the side of the onramp (where the Metro buses load) to observe and film with my IPhone.  These were not recognizable as aircraft since each craft (i.e. light) was spaced much too closely together.  Their elevation was lower than what aircraft normally fly at and they were at various altitudes.   There were not any strobes (white, green, or red) that would indicate these were valid aircraft these lights were of a pinkish-orange color.  All were the same color and brightness. As the lights traveled south until the what appeared to be the southern end of Mercer Island and then elevated up to the clouds and could not be seen thereafter. After about 7 of these passed us, an 8th followed them at extremely high speed and also elevated into the clouds. Curious to see more, I exited the freeway at Coal Creek Parkway and drove to the top of Somerset (neighborhood).  From the top of Somerset, I could see aircraft approaching SeaTac Intl. Airport, which is much further away than Mercer Island.   The aircraft approaching SeaTac had visible strobes - so the lights that I saw, which were much closer than SeaTac, clearly were not typical aircraft as no strobes were present. I have footage of some of them captured on my IPhone.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556

Colorful electrical looking sphere seen looking east towards Issaquah.;2012-09-30 01:00:00;1 hour or more;Colorful electrical looking sphere seen looking east towards Issaquah. My husband was going out for a swim in our backyard and just happened to look up in the sky looking east towards issaquah ( we are in Bellevue).  He saw an interesting light kind of flickering.  Curiosity peaked, he came inside and got out the telescope ( not very good one). When he looked through it he could see what look like a colorful sphere of electricity in continual motion but not changing location much.  He called me out of bed, me thrilled of course, and I took a look.  When I took a look it seemed to me that it was constantly changing colors but multiple colors at the same time.   All I can think that it reminds me of is those glass spheres that you put your hands on and when you touch the glass the electricity comes towards your fingers but in colors- red, blue, green etc. all at the same time. Not much background here.  I am really not much of a believer and my husband is!;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
5 orange lights seen above lake Washington, Bellevue, WA;2013-06-04 23:30:00;10 minutes;5 orange lights seen above lake Washington, Bellevue, WA My girlfriend called me outside to see some orange lights in the sky.  She said there were 5 of them and were floating without moving and were in a V formation.  When I got outside they had moved behind some trees but I saw them as the moved past the trees.  They looked to be at least half a mile away but she said they looked much closer when she first saw them. They were glowing in a dull, warm orange color and looked be round.  They were not super bright but were quite visable.  My first thought was that they were Chinese lanterns that someone had released but they were drifting south and I checked a local weather website and it said that the wind was north northwest that night (as it almost always is here) so it doesn't make sense that they were Chinese lanterns. After a few minutes they drifted further behind trees and buildings so we could not see them.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556

Weird purple cloud at night.;2014-12-28 11:50:00;3 minutes;Weird Purple Cloud At Night While i was walking my dogs with my boyfriend at night, we happened to see a purple cloud, light up before our eyes.  At first we thought it was coming from someones house but on closer inspection, we noticed the light was too high above the clouds to have come from a house.   This cloud was tall and was connected with the other clouds in the sky.  It was moving south of King County here in WA state.  It was partly cloudy tonight but you could see the glow so clearly and so vibrant.   As we rushed inside to show our friend, the entire cloud was gone!  But the rest of the clouds remained. It was the weirdest thing i have ever seen.   This was my first paranormal sighting, if you can call it that.  I'm hoping someone else reported this but it was at 1:50am in the morning so I don't believe so.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
Green light shot up into the air, hovered, turned red, then green again, then flew off in different direction.;2015-05-09 21:00:00;30-60 seconds;Green light shot up into the air, hovered, turned red, then green again, then flew off in different direction. I have never seen a UFO before, but this was a strange sighting.  I am already forgetting the details, but what I recall was something like this:  a green light (or two lights, but as if in one vehicle?) shot up from low in the sky at a speed that made me think of a firework being launched.  The light(s) reached a certain altitude (30-45 degrees up from the horizon) and hovered for what felt like 30 seconds.   I got out of my car to look at it, because the initial movement (and the subsequent lack thereof) was so unusual.  It just hovered there for an oddly long stretch of time, then I noticed the light(s) were red, as though it had turned around abruptly.  It still hovered for a few more seconds, then took off again in a different direction, flying off out of sight, maybe with green lights again.   I should have recorded all this right after seeing it, but my kids (who saw it too) were a little freaked out, and I had to downplay the whole thing.  Can't remember if I ever saw red and green lights at the same time.   The initial shooting up movement was much faster than a commercial plane, though perhaps could have been a fighter jet?  No sound was heard, though.   My kids suggested the hovering light was a flying vehicle heading towards us, hence the appaearance of not moving.  But there was never any change in light size or brightness, as you see when an airplane (which always has white lights!) is heading towards you.;47.6054302777778;-122.173818055556
