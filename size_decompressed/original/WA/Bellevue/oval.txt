object seen in sky chased away by military helicopter followed by a air force one sighting.;2006-07-25 18:00:00;15 minutes;object seen in sky chased away by military helicopter followed by a air force one sighting. 6 of us were sitting in front of my friends house in bellevue,wa.  Sitting outside in lawn chairs catching up on eachothers day is a common practice amongst us.  I had been looking up at the sky when i noticed a silver metalic looking object in the sky above.  I immediatley jumped out of my seat and pointed towards the sky.  It sort of just hovered there right next to the cloud.  Now this shape is unlike anything i had ever seen.  It almost looked like three different circles combined into a solid shape.  I guess the best description would be the krylon spray paint can.  Imagine those three circles meshed into one.  My 5 friends sat there in aww of the event that was occuring.  My friends also being the biggest skeptics on this planet were also pointing and trying to figure it out.  We sat there and watched it hover for about 15 minutes, keep in mind this was broad daylight about 6:00 p.m.  After about 15 minutes the object began to slowly hide behind a cloud.  But it floated around the cloud and we never saw it again.  Now this is were it gets very strange.  About 10-15 minutes after the object went into the cloud, a all black helicopter appeared and went into the same cloud, almost as if it was chasing it.  The helicopter dissapeared into the cloud.  Roughly ten minutes after that event, air force one flew over the same area.  This was the same day that 520 bridge had been shut down, so the president could come meet with bill gates.  I have never been known to lie, and i can put this on my life that everything that i just described was 100 percent real.  I have seen many crafts in washington state,  but that was the clearest observance of a ufo.  Was an extra terrestrial craft watching the president of the united states?  Was it a daylite satelitte and a large quinsidence?  Or was it a spy plane or device used for watching us or the president?  I will never know, but that will go down as the most remarkable thing i have ever seen.  This definetley beats back in 1996 when a streak of light flew by sammamish,wa.  All of the neighborhood kids and i chased it down the street as well as many adults.  It was a 100 foot streak of light.  The news as well as the goverment alerted every one that it was rocket debri from space.  Im not buying it, and i will devote my life to this trade to uncover to the public that we are being observed and visited on a daily basis.  Next time you see military choppers over your house, i would do a little investigative work.  Watch the skies, the truth is right in front of your eyes.

PD));2007-10-28 06:17:00;4 Minutes;Carsh landed in Longwood,was on radio 570mHz AM at 6:30a  The craft came from space out of the north looked like star,then changed course then looked like a shotting star. Changed course again going SSE and it now looked like a lit cigar shape.   Changing course again to ESE I got a look at the top and was sure at this time it was a UFO.  It buffeted as if it over corrected on the last course change and then tried to correct its course again an buffeted back and I saw the under side,it matched the gray color sky.  Then dwon it went to the ESE.  Seconds later I saw what looked like an energy shift in a circular pattern at least 20 times larger than the UFO.  The UFO was about 15 metters,traveling about 50k plus MPH. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate date of alleged report and incident.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports.  Possible hoax??
