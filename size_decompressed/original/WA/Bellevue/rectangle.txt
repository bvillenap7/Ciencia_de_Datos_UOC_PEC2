craft leaped across the sky to hover above me;1998-09-25 23:00:00;25 minutes;craft leaped across the sky to hover above me Leaving Mother's home in Bellevue saw bright light in sky towards the East.  Observed light following to my left as I drove home to Redmond, Wa on my left.  When I arrived home I walked around the side of my building and saw the light in the sky quite aways away to the Northeast of Redmond.  Suddenly in an instant the light leaped across the sky and was overhead.  There was no sound.  I was frozen in amazement.  There were many many lights and I believe they were colored but do not remember exactly.  I suddently was afraid and ran upstairs to my apartment and ran to the phone and called my Mom to tell her.  I have only told family members about this and I wish I had known about the reporting center at the time.  I didn't write it down and wish I had.  I have never seen it again until today when I saw Peter Jennings on NW Afternoon and heard the account of the policemen. The craft as I believe it was, was really huge and was hovering above me.
