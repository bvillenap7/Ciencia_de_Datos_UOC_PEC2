Orange ufo flying over College Place, WA;2011-04-09 22:15:00;3 minutes;Orange ufo flying over College Place, WA I was returning from the laundry room at around 22:15 PST when I noticed two orange balls of light flying slowly in a line from south to north.  I ran back to my place and grabbed a pair of binoculars and observed the two objects for about a minute.  Through the binoculars the object appeared to have no form, just a pulsating ball of orange light.  I then noticed a third orange light following in line behind the other two.  This third object was nearly directly above me so I got a better view through the binoculars but there was still not form, just a ball of orange light.  I watched as all three objects disappeared into the distance.  It was a cloudy night and these objects were below the cloud cover.  They made no noise whatsoever, just moved silently. I do not believe the objects were an airplane or helicopter because even with binoculars the objects were just balls of light yet they were not too far away and they made no noise.  I got one grainy picture on my ce! ll phone but donâ€™t know how much use it might be.  I am a 23 year old college senior.;46.0465;-118.4039
