Stationary streetlight looking craft/tri-lit orange/green/red UFO hovering through College Place, WA;2012-11-18 20:15:00;19:00;Stationary streetlight looking craft/tri-lit orange/green/red UFO hovering through College Place, WA Walking down the street looking at the sky when I noticed a single star in the sky, slightly resembling a streetlight. It was cloudy out, so it struck me as sort of odd that the one single star shown so brightly. I experienced a psychedelic flashback while staring at the &quotstar&quot and walking, where I was trapped walking in place(the road beneath me was moving, and a fence I was walking by was still panning past me), and the star seemed to be the only object that was normal within that period, which seemed like eternity.  Terrified, the thought of the star being a UFO and inducing my trip occurred to me and I was able to come out of that state. I'd been observing the star for a good 4 minutes. After, I'd walked past a tree that had blocked my view of the object, and once passed the obstacle, the star was gone.  I looked around the sky a bit and found it slowly hovering to the north of me, the size of an aspirin at arms length, with the orange streetlight glow dimmed and a green and red light added to it in a triangle formation. I watched as it slowly flew over head for a good 01:10-15(minute:second) until it faded into some clouds. I continued looking for it, and noticed it reappear in the distance 2:10 later, half the size, moving at the same speed for about 10 seconds. Throughout the period of the craft moving, there was a sound similar to an airplane, only it seemed to be coming from the ground. The object was too slow to be an airplane, and had a sort of hazy greenish glowing ring around it.;46.0465;-118.4039
