The lights were bright and amber, a long way out and above the horizon, they were moving very slow from north to south,they seemed to be about the size of soccer balls..at the distance they were.  I and my wife watched these lights for around twenty minutes  Until one by one they gradually just went out.  I am 72 my wife is 64 we have never seen anything before like this..what (on earth) was this?;46.0465;-118.4039
String of stars evenly spaced out for 30 min.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-18 20:40:00;30 minutes;String of stars evenly spaced out for 30 min. Saw a string of Stars evenly spaced out for about 30 minutes, could be 50+, they were in a staight line.  towards the end the line was in a different part of the ski but going the same direction going north-east.  toward the end the end of the 30 minutes the stars were not in line up perfectly.  No noise, very high like a Satelite, Also saw a shooting star go across too.  I do have a poor video;46.0465;-118.4039
