Two orange objects seen in eastern washington sky;2006-04-29 00:30:00;3 minutes;Two orange objects seen in eastern washington sky At approximately 0:30, I was headed north bound going home when I saw two orange objects in the sky. I didn't think anything of it until I arrived at my house and started walking to my door. I quickly notified my roomate to come outside and see what I saw. He came outside with me and witnessed these two objects hovering in the north sky. After about 30 seconds of staring at these objects one disappeared from the sky. As we watched the other object in the sky, we saw what looked like bright flashes underneath the object. It appeared as if it was being shot at by something because of the loud explotion noise we heard. After about 30 seconds, the object slowly faded away as if it had disappeared.;46.0465;-118.4039
