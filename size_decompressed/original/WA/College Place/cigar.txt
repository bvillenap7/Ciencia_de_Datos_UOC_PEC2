It appeared to be 6 to 15 feet in length and was brown in color. It passed in a North to South direction and was gone in a a second.Because of the house blocking my view I could not follow it . It was traveling at a great speed.  After it was gone my mind tried to process what it was,  My first impulse was to identify it as a known object and failing this I decided to make a report.;46.0465;-118.4039
