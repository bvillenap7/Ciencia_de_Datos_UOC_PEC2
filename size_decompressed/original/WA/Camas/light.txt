Appeared to be a satelite, then it zigzaged, then straight with speed variation;2002-06-14 23:30:00;5-8 seconds;Appeared to be a satelite, then it zigzaged, then straight with speed variation It was approximately 11:00 to 11:30PM on June 14th, 2002. I like to look at the stars from time to time. This particular evening, I noticed a satelite slowly go by. Within 5 seconds, in the same location and path of that satelite, I noticed what appeared to be another satelight, then it flew in a zigzag pattern, then straight with a speed variation, then appeared to stop and then faded away in the same spot it stopped at. The distance I noticed it fly equated to streaching my arm out, and spreading my thumb and index finger by approximately 5 to 6 inches. My guess is that it was as high as satelites usually are, and the sun was reflecting on it, as it would a satelite. I did'nt notice an unusual color or lights.;45.6073;-122.4147
Bright, white light moving quickly across the sky in Camas, WA.;2009-08-27 21:00:00;2 sec;Bright, white light moving quickly across the sky in Camas, WA. My mother's friend and I were driving along the highway in Camas, Washington, the night of the 27th in August, 2009, around 9:30 or so.  I witnessed a bright, white, circular light (without a tail) that did not flash like an airplane, yet moved not unlike an aircraft.  However, the object moved faster than any of the planes usually flying in the area (Portland has an airport across the river from Camas/Vancouver).  I saw the light move from through the front window in the car, then flying from the center of the sky toward the horizon and vanishing.  The object moved incredibly fast faster than any of the jets I had seen in the area  The object was not a shooting star: the object had no tail, and moved like a solid, bright object across the sky.  The most mysterious part was the object's sudden disappearance once it reached the edge of the sky.;45.6073;-122.4147
Three bright lights, hovering & moving straight up into the night sky and disappear.;2018-08-12 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Three bright lights, hovering & moving straight up into the night sky and disappear. I was talking on the phone last night and observed three bright stars, thinking that it was wierd, cause I had never seen them there before.  I believe mars was either above them or below them, I was facing south, then they started moving.  And what caught my eye was their speed and movement did not look like a plan or falling star.   The first one appeared to me to moving upward and as it was moving disappeared into the sky above, not across the night sky but straight up, thatâ€™s what caught my eye.  It was the strangeness of the movement.  So then I watched the other two lights, then the second light moved in the same way as the first, straight up and disappeared, and then the third one did the same.  I have never seen anything like that.;45.6073;-122.4147
