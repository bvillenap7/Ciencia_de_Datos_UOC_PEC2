White oval craft flying ridiculous speeds, changing direction in seconds.;2009-02-27 23:23:00;seconds;White oval craft flying ridiculous speeds, changing direction in seconds. I was driving down 18th street in Camas, Washington, going about 27 mph.  I looked out the drivers side window and saw a fast moving aircraft parallel to the car [traveling south towards Portland airspace], I noticed it was traveling much faster then any other plane then I had seen.  I then looked back towards the road and asked the two passengers to look out the windows and spot it.  Once they found it, it had changed course and was now perpendicular to us, moving west.  We all agree that it looked as if it was more in Portland airspace then in Washington, but distance is relative.  The odd thing is, on top of the Incredible speed, was the fact that the craft was purely white in color, I do believe that FAA standards regulate for a navigation light on at least the wings and tail.  There were none of these.  Only white lights all around the craft with one white strobe light.  Again, it was going faster then I've ever seen even an F-22 fly.;45.6073;-122.4147
Light fly in the air and stopping.;2018-11-12 06:30:00;Idk what this means;Light fly in the air and stopping. Me and my friends where in a church parking lot and there where objects that where stationed in the air for a hour and a half, and then they started moving a being lights and circling and now like a hour later they are still circling.;45.6073;-122.4147
