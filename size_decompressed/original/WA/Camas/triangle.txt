One big round red-orange sphere, moved across the sky, slowly, disappeared I was looking out my living room window at Mount Hood around 9:45, and slightly to the left of the mountain, I observed three bright reddish-orangey lights, in the shape of an obtuse triangle.  I did not witness any movement of these lights.  To the right and slightly north of the triangle, there was a much larger, brighter, reddish-orangey light, about the size of a large superball, maybe a tiny bit bigger.  It moved in a straight line, until I could no longer see it from where I was sitting.  In the above information, I put 2-4 crafts, because I am unsure as to whether or not the three smaller lights were one craft or three separate ones.  The large one was definitely separate from the triangular lights.  It also had a sort of haze around it, like the light was very bright.;45.6073;-122.4147
