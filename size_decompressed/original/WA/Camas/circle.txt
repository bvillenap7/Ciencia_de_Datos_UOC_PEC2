Bright orange circular object moving across sky;2009-10-31 19:35:00;10 minutes;Bright orange circular object moving across sky We were walking and going home from trick or treating, then I saw a round shaped UFO.  It had one orange or yellowish light which looked like it was burning.  The object was moving pretty slowly. My two sisters and my mom also saw it.  I do not know what it was.  I do not know if it was a rocket or plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.6073;-122.4147
Orange Disc's hovering across the Camas Meadows bulding, Camas WA;2012-08-18 22:30:00;4 minutes;Orange Disc's hovering across the Camas Meadows bulding, Camas WA 4105 Northwest Camas Meadows Drive  Camas, WA 98607  It was about 10:30pm, 8/18/2012  and I was driving home from work.  I was passing by the Camas Meadows building (main entrance - 4105 Northwest Camas Meadows Drive  Camas, WA 98607,). I glanced toward my right side (Camas Meadows is on my left) and noticed several orange disc’s hovering up in the sky.  I thought at first it was a car dealership or the Golf Course had some lights on a string. As I crawled along (thankfully no one was behind me), staring out my passenger side window.  I saw more and more orange disc’s.  These were very high up in the sky. I finally get a good view between the trees and saw maybe 20 or more orange disc’s in a large circle, just hovering. I stopped and tried to take a picture and all of a sudden they were gone except for 2.  But these 2 were almost over the trees and I could not get a picture. Did anyone else see these orange disc’s?;45.6073;-122.4147
