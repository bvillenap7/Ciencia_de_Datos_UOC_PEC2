I was outside searching for it and I looked up for UFO's since I have recently sighted one I saw a glowing object as it was on fire it fell for about 3 sec. it had a smoke trail behind it then it was no longer in veiw. It made a whzzing noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports of this event, although we believe the event may have been the one that occurred at approximately 2200 hrs..  If they are the same events, the object was seen to the north of Victoria, BC, reportedly coursing (flying) parallel to the northern horizon.  It was reported to Canadian astronomers.
