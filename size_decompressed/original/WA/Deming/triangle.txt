They were all in a straight line as I looked the line of lights was almost horizon to horizon.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-28 18:35:00;10 minutes;My son and I had just pulled into our driveway at 6:35.  I shutoff the truck and stepped out. My son was staring at the sky which was really clear. I  looked straight up and in the sky full of stars I seen a large isosulese triangle and it was moving across the sky horizontally over head.  It was moving fairly quick with what looked like stars evenly spaced behind it like it was towing them.  They were all in a straight line as I looked the line of lights was almost horizon to horizon.  I counted 50 or so and then there was a set of two in the line that were ofset almost like a tail ruter.  The direction of travel was from sw to ne and lasted ten mins.  I even made my mother come look to make sure we weren't seeing things.;48.8018;-122.0918
