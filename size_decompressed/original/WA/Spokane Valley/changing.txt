Unexplained light show over Spokane Valley, Wa.;2012-12-08 20:45:00;8 minutes;Unexplained light show over Spokane Valley, Wa Date: 12-08-12  Time:20:40	  Conditions:  Cold but clear   I live in Spokane Washington and live in the Spokane Valley.  I was heading home from the 7-11 in Millwood.  I live on the north side of the river, turned onto Upriver Drive heading west, just about the time I got to the corner by Pasadena Elementary School I notice a couple of red lights about my side window in the middle of the corner.  I continued driving west on Upriver slowing to about 10-15 miles per hour because I had never seen lights in the sky like these before.   Now there were 8 lights that appeared just to left of Upriver, kind of looking like they were coming at me from the Airway Heights area towards Felts Field Airport.  The lights didn’t fly in a straight line, they seem to appear like slowly bobbing up and down, not a lot but out the windshield about a few inches,  They made a lot of ground very quickly.   About the time I reached Dick Rd, I pulled over to the side of the rode and rolled down my window shut off the radio and fan, to see if I could hear anything but did not.  So I sat there and watched them for several minutes, as the first one got to where it looked as if it were out my window it took off toward the south not only heading south but going up very fast then stopped and hovered.   Then the next one did the same,then the next one until it appeared to make like a backward J in the sky.  At that point the first one took off upwards and disappeared then the next until all were gone. I then pulled back onto Upriver Drive and I as I got back out on the road again, a ball of red light slowly started descending to what appeared to be over Beacon Hill heading towards Felts Field again I have never seen any kind of light like this before in the sky.  I drove home as fast as I could probably taking 1 minute from the time I pulled back onto Upriver, I ran into the house telling my 3 sons and wife and my son’s friend and one son’s girlfriend to come out and check this out.  Told them you have never seen anything like this before in your life.   Everyone ran out the back door and at that time 3 red lights appeared in a triangle shape hovering looking southeast out my backyard for about 3 minutes before the light at the right side of the triangle took off followed by the next two. I work in the medical field and have never before looked at this sight or have I ever called and reported anything before.  There is no way anything man made could have moved or propelled itself the way these objects could.

I saw six red lights hovering in a triangle formation but by the time I got down to the end of our pool there were only three lights in a half moon formation.  It looked like they were moving but still hovering too.   My son did pull out his cell phone and video the three lights and you can see it on the phone but it was hard to see on the computer.  Then the three lights one by one just disappeared and no sound at all.  They were Just gone.   It was hard to explain what it was but we all saw the same thing at the same time.
