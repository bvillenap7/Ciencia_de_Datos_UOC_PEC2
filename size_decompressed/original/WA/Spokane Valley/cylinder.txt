3 long silver cylinders not moving placed like in a half moon shape;2019-03-13 18:30:00;steady;3 long silver cylinders not moving placed like in a half moon shape On March 13, 2019, approximately 6:30pm I was driving west in the Spokane Valley, WA, and saw 3 cylinder objects in the sky.  I thought they were jets at first but could see that they were not because they were long silver cylinders in shape and not moving with lights.  There was no white smoke coming from them either like jets.  The 3 long cylinders were placed in a half moon shape.   The sky was clear.  I noticed off to the left but looked far from them was a jet for sure because it had a trail of white smoke.  I was concerned and went home as fast as I could.   Called my brother about it and he told me to report it on your sight.  Do you know what these cylinders are?;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
