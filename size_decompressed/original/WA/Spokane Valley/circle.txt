Four orange lights flying straight up.;2015-01-10 22:15:00;10 minutes;Four orange lights flying straight up It was a partly cloudy night and my husband was taking the trash out to the garbage can when he spotted 4 orange circular lights in the sky flying straight up into the air.  They were traveling at a very fast rate to the south southeast of my location.  The airforce base and airport around here is to the west of where I live.  After some time of going straight up, they began curving slightly towards the left and started gradually disappearing.  They were moving so fast that by the time I ran inside to grab my phone to record video, there were only 2 dots left.  There was no sound, but my husband said he thought he saw black particles beneath the dots which made him think fireworks, but there were no explosions or sparkles of light normally associated with fireworks.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667

It then slowed quite a lot and moved in an arc to the east.   It then went at a very higher speed to the west toward the the moon.  The moon then drowned out the what ever it was.   I love the sky and this was something I have never experienced. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  He seems to be a skilled observer of the nighttime sky.  PD));47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
Brilliant white orb hovering in western sky over Spokane.;2018-04-12 20:35:00;20 minutes +;Brilliant white orb hovering in western sky over Spokane. I witnessed my neighbor outside looking at the sky, he has never seen the stars as he is night blind.  I stepped out onto our shared porch and he asks what that light in the sky was.  I observed a bright white orb in the western sky, seeming to hover in place, my wife then stepped out to see what we were looking at.  She observed the same object. I attempted to Google the planets as I am not an astronomer.  The object stayed in place while I did this. I knew it wasn't Venus and far too bright to be a satellite.  Fifteen minutes later, convinced it must be a planet, I went back inside with my wife. 20 minutes later I stepped out to leave for the grocery store and it was just gone. I viewed this object myself for about 15 minutes, my neighbor was viewing it 5 minutes before I stepped out on the porch.  The light was brilliant white. It did not change intensity. No blinking, flashing, or any movement that I could discern.  My wife said she felt like it was shifting positions ever so slightly, but I did not notice this.  The sky was clear and stars were visible. We have regular air traffic in the western sky from our vantage point and have lived here for 4 years.  My wife and I have not seen this before.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667

I saw two white objects directly in front of me (in the northern part of the sky).  They were flying from east to west. The objects were equal distance apart and I could not find any recognizable features.  The remained an equal distance apart from one another as they flew. I was stopped at a red light so I took video of them.  When the light turned green I had to proceed and could no longer tape them. I have been an elementary school teacher for 20 years.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
Small dot in the daytime sky moving around an airplane contrail;2018-09-03 14:30:00;10 minutes;Small dot in the daytime sky moving around an airplane contrail This sighting was made by my wife and daughter. As I approached them in my truck, they were looking and pointing to the sky.  I pulled up alongside and my daughter was wondering about a small dot of light in the sky was doing.  Both ladies were observing it moving around in a small area of the sky near an “aging” airplane contrail.  The contrail was actually providing a reference as it moved along, and across it, and seemed to be making some right-angle moves at times.    I was attempting to see what they were seeing, but not able to do so.  (I was actually mistakenly looking at for the object along the wrong contrail—there were 2 fairly close together and parallel in the sky and the one that I needed to be looking at was higher up, and the roof of my truck was blocking the correct one).  I reached under the seat and handed my daughter my binoculars.  She described it as “round” and either “spinning or pulsating” at about 1 second intervals.  (Still a fairly small dot even with the binoculars).  I was frustrated because I couldn’t see it, but was looking about 10 degrees of arc in the wrong area).  She watched for about 5-10 minutes until it faded from view as it headed south. (From the angle in the sky, it would have been probably over the Veradale or Liberty Lake area).;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
