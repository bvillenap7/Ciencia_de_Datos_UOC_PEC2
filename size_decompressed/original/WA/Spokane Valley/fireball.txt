FIREBALLS SEEN BY ENTIRE FAMILY OVER THE SPOKANE VALLEY...VIDEO EVIDENCE TOO!!;2012-12-08 20:45:00;15 minutes;FIREBALLS SEEN BY ENTIRE FAMILY OVER THE SPOKANE VALLEY...VIDEO EVIDENCE TOO!!   AT APPROXIMATELY 2030 HLT MY FAMILY AND I WITNESSED 6 TO 8 FIREY BALLS IN THE SKY.  THEY WERE ALL MOVING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND DID NOT SEEM TO FLY IN ANY KNOWN FORMATION THAT I AM AWARE OF.   WHEN I SAW THE LIGHTS THEY WERE IN THE SOUTHERN SKY OVER THE CITY,  AND THEY WERE IN A VERTICAL LINE AND THEN THEY STARTED MOVING AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER.  SOME EVEN FLEW DIRECTLY ABOVE OUR HOME.  I HAVE BEEN IN THE MILITARY FOR YEARS NOW AND AM TRAINED TO SEE AND OBSERVE MY SURROUNDING AREAS.  THIS EVENT TONIGHT HAS ME WONDERING WHAT I HAVE SEEN.   THIS ISN'T MY FIRST TIME SEEING A UFO IN THIS AREA.  WE HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE OF THIS EVENT AS WELL.  MY FATHER, WHO IS A MAN THAT BELIEVES SCIENCE CAN PROVE MANY THINGS, IS SPEECHLESS.  HE CANNOT FATHOM WHAT HE HAS SEEN TONIGHT.  BEFORE THEY DISAPPEARED, ONE OBJECT TOOK A ROUNDED TURN IN THE SKY AND LOOKED LIKE IT WAS PROPELLING ITSELF THROUGH A PORTAL OR SOMETHING, THE RATE OF SPEED THAT IT JUST VANISHED IN THE SKY IS INCREDIBLE. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite objective and sober-minded in his description of the sighting event.  We are awaiting additional reports from the other witnesses.  PD));47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667

Thought nothing of it its new years thought it might be helicopter but no noise was heard and its 16Â° f outside.  Walked to the other side of apartment and saw 3 floating orange red orb in cloud fog for at least 40 seconds before they dissipated into not being there even when sky clears.   Also have seen many zig zag craft in this area over the last 3 years.  Have not reported any activity before but would like to know if other locals saw.  Boyfriend was present and a witness to this as well.  Second orange orb sighting in spokane valley . first was October 10th 2015.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
