A large white almost translucent looking spherical object with lights around its middle, over Spokane, Washington.;2014-06-01 20:00:00;30-40 minutes;A large white almost translucent looking spherical object with lights around its middle, over Spokane, Washington 8pm Sunday evening  I noticed what appeared to be a large star in our western sky, I quickly realized that it was far to early for stars to be visible, there were none others visible.   My friend who had joined me asked how long it had been there and I replied about ten minutes, she said go get your telescope which I did.  The object was spherical with lights around its middle very clearly visible.  It changed many times it's attitude, meaning it seemed to tip and the lights were at one point close to vertical, then it would right itself and the lights that were around it were again horizontal.  This was witnessed by myself and five other adults that were nearby, all agreed that what we were witnessing matched the description given above.  It was visible for nearly 30-40 minutes.  It moved in northwesterly direction until it was no longer visible.   No drugs or alcohol had been used by any of the witnesses...well except one!;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667

It looked bizarre with a spotting scope. It looks weird in my video as well. UFO 02/02/2020 6:15 pm My husband noticed a strange light in the sky and called me outside. It was dark, clear sky, no clouds, half moon or so. It was coming from the Southwest very slow. I could not see any sort of craft just very bright light. I saw a red orb appear for a second and then disappear. It stayed in the same general area for about 40 minutes. Our neighbor came outside with his spotting scope. It looked, well, it wasn’t a drone. It had a ring of yellow lights around the edge but they were moving, fluctuating, like the surface of the sun, and the center had a grid of blue purple lights. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get a picture through the scope. It moved westward, which I didn’t see as I was running home from the neighbors. Then it slowly moved back to the Southwest. We watched it slowly moved further away for an hour. It was a blip in the distance and started flashing different colors. I took the video with my iPhone X.  I apologize for the expletives.  Any sudden movement in the vide! o is mine. It just bobbed up and down and side to side.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
Lights racing around;2020-09-27 05:18:00;15 minutes;Lights racing around This morning I was on the back deck reading when I saw a bright flash of light It was bright enough that it turned my head up even though I was looking at my kindle.  I saw it flash, then disappear and reappear nearby for a couple minutes.  This was just ‘above’ the small dipper.  Then it was joined by several others.  They moved around, as well as disappeared and instantly reappeared a ways away.  They got into a straight line and moved in unison for a bit: like they were on a string around a spoke.  Then it all settled into a single one that just danced around a bit.  I’m writing this at 0516 hrs, and it’s still there. I finally got bored watching it. I didn’t get video because, except for the first few seconds it wasn’t bright enough for my iPhone to see.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
