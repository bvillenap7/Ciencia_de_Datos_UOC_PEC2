Yellow to bright white.   Came up over the horizon northeast and headed  west  and upward very bright.  Hovered and were equal distance from one another.   Stopped due north of us then went straight up and to the north at a slow speed slowly becoming fainter but remained visible.   Directly above us began floating southwest.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
In a look out called the saltese hills, star gazing because there had already been quite a few weird things in the sky.;2010-09-30 05:30:00;10 minutes;We were in a look out called the saltese hills, star gazing because there had already been quite a few weird things in the sky that night.  We were standing outside the car when my fiance pulled me down underneath it.  It was only about 250 feet above us, triangular with a strobing kind of head light.  Totally silent with orbs of light glowing beneath it.  We could clearly make out the workings of the ship.  We saw it land in the dry lake area called the saltese flats where it gathered quite a bit of fog and then rose back into the air, and flying literally back into space it seemed.  Then 3 stars that had always been in the sky came together in a triangular formation and took off after it.  My fiance and I will never be the same and it was probably one of the more traumatic experiences of my life. Spokane is a hot spot, people. Since what we call the encounter we've purchased the best binoculars we can afford and often times the helecoptors we see in the sky are actually triangular ships with the lights made to look like helecoptors.  We see crazy shit every night and wonder if we're the only ones watching. Someone needs to get to Spokane to check this stuff out because, as I said, it's every night. My fiance and a couple of our friends that grew up in the area green acres are recently sure they've been abducted as children, and now again as adults, myself included. Too many coincidences.  All the same experience.  Hypnosis involved with discovery as well as natural memory recovery.  Half the time we feel like we're losing our minds until we remember that we're sane people and this stuff is really happening.  Local authorities thing we're bad shit crazy, but oh well. We would LOVE to be contacted by you guys so at least then we could get some answers.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
First saw a bright light in the sky, brighter than any visible star.  Light disappears instantly.;2015-06-15 01:10:00;4 minutes;First saw a bright light in the sky, brighter than any visible star.  Light disappears instantly.  Approximately 1 minute later, 2 of us saw a low flying V-shaped craft with 5 lights on the underside of it.  It also appeared to be somewhat translucent.  The craft was flying fast but steady then disappeared from sight.  Created no sound.   Another witness saw the same craft described approximately 3 minutes later.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
A large plane being followed by a triangular shaped craft;2017-05-18 12:21:00;2 minutes;A large plane being followed by a triangular shaped craft Thursday May 18, 2017-12:21 PM, Spokane Valley, WA  It was noonish on Thursday.  I was working in the backyard.  I heard a plane and casually glanced up.  I to had to look again because I didn't understand what I was looking at.  I saw a large plane, like a 747, with what looked like a triangle flying next to it. I was looking to the north.  The plane was flying east, at fairly high altitude.  There was silver or white triangle flying on the right side of the plane just back from the nose of the plane.  The triangle was shaped like a very narrow paper airplane.  It was traveling at the same speed as the plane and was about half as long as the plane. I watched the two fly above a cloud and then come out the other side.  As soon as they hit the cloud, I ran for my phone but, by the time I got my phone on they were too far away to see on my camera. I know what I saw. It was in the middle of the afternoon on a sunny day with a few clouds.  The plane could not have taken off at our local airport because of its high altitude.  Had it taken off at GEG, it would have been much lower.  However, Fairchild AF base is very near the airport.   I guess maybe it could have been one of their planes.  The triangular shaped craft was either white or silver.  It was not a like any plane or a helicopter I've ever seen. Oddly the plane left a contrail but the triangle craft did not;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
