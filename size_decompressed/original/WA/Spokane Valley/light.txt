A bright, white object near the North Star completely faded rapidly in clear skies.;2004-03-11 05:00:00;15 Seconds;A bright, white object near the North Star completely faded rapidly in clear skies. A white dot near the North Star as bright as, perhaps brighter than, Jupiter. (Jupiter had set about 6 hours earlier and it was impossible for any planet to have been in this part of the sky anyway.)  It did not twinkle.  Almost immediately after I had first set eyes on it, it began to fade rapidly and steadily until it vanished.  At first I thought that a cloud had passed in front of it but then I noticed that the sky all around was completely clear.  To be sure that it hadn't been covered by a small, isolated cloud, I continued to watch.  It did not reappear even after a minute or so.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
Two UFO's flying togeather, one red the other white in Washington state;2008-07-24 10:10:00;40 min;Two UFO's flying togeather, one red the other white in Washington state Two Unidentified Flying Objects Seen Flying Togeather, One Red and the Other White My co-worker and I were surveying not too far from I-90 near Liberty lake WA (Spokane metro area) and after admiring the moon I suddenly noticed a bright star looking object flickering from dim to very bright white in an in-consistent fashion at the 11 o'clock position about half a fingers length from the moon. I had thought to myself that there is no way you would see a star at 10:10 a.m. PDST. The object proceeded to move due east and west little bits at a time making right angle turns to the north then south. The object then immediately darted accross the sky to what seemed at least 100 miles then stopping instaniously remaining stationary for some 15 minutes while moving at a slower rate but makeing right angle turns every few seconds. We continued working while it remained in the sky when suddenly I noticed it dissapeared the re-appeared near the moon again 2 seconds later. This time I noticed the intense bright white object was joined with a second bright red object looking to be the same size. They seemed to play with each other for at least 25 minutes making more right angle turns at incredible rates of speed in the western half of the sky darting from the north to south side. I could not really make out what size the UFO's were, all I can really say is it appeared to be two bright dots simular to stars in the sky. I am an experienced pilot who flew for many years since I was a child then flying for Forestry for the British Columbia Gov't and I have to say this was by no means any type of conventional aircraft that the public knows. Anyone else seeing anything in the Northwest lately? The thought of the military crossed my mind testing unconventional aircraft/spacecraft such as the T3B reverse-engineered from ET Technology, but who knows right?;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
Bright light, changing color from white to red, moving east over Spokane Valley, WA;2009-08-12 22:00:00;2 minutes;Bright light, changing color from white to red, moving east over Spokane Valley, WA At approximately 22:00 on August 12, 2009, I had stepped out the front door of my residence when I observed a bright white light in the sky directly overhead moving due east (090 degrees).  I initially believed it to be a satellite since I often see satellites at this time of evening, however. I immediately realized that there was an area of solid cloud cover obscuring the stars at approximately 2,000 ft. AGL. The object was below the cloud cover. I estimated its speed to be 50-60 mph.  The object made no discernable sound, and had no apparent shape or nagivation, wingtip or landing lights.  After observing the object for approximately one minute, the object entered a cloud for approximately 10 seconds. When it emerged, it had changed color from white to solid red and had changed heading to north-northeast, about 060 degrees. At that time, I called my wife to come see it. By the time she came outside, the object was some distance away, but she was able to see the object's color and direction of travel. We continued to observe the object until it had passed out of sight behind distant trees.  The local television station, KXLY, reported a story regarding observations by other witnesses in the area of the same or similar objects in the same timeframe on August 12.  I have worked in military and civil aviation for more than 20 years as a maintenance technician and aviation consultant. In addition, aviation history is a hobby of mine. I have observed most types of commercial, military and civil aircraft operating in many different types of weather and lighting conditions. The appearance of the object I observed is not consistent with any type of fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft with which I am familiar.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
Large Red Dot moving across sky;2012-04-14 22:00:00;3 minutes;Large Red Dot moving across sky There was a fairly larger red dot in the sky that was moving in a southerly direction very slowly. There were quite a few clouds, but the light appeared to be in and out of the clouds.  The light would bounce around from left to right every once and a while, but continued in the southerly direction.  It was too slow for an airplane, but it's lateral movements were too fast for a helicopter.  We couldn't hear any sounds.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667

It lit up then we saw sparkling lights drop from the large, bright light.  It seemed to then move toward the east, continuing to drop the sparkling lights and then vanished.  My son kept asking me what was “falling out” of the ‘plane.’   I told him I didn’t know  and had never seen that before.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
Bright white light, maybe a meteor.;2016-09-15 20:25:00;15 minutes;Bright white light, maybe a meteor 	Tried to call but I am having phone issues.  Trying this. I/we saw an object, brilliant white light moving south to north, it appeared to be coming down but then seemed to change trajectory and move horizontally.  No sound, no  tail that we could see.  It was within about a quarter mile from us, pretty low to the ground, just a few hundred feet. I was setting with my son talking on the front porch, the object went over the house tops, we moved to the street to follow it but lost it.  By the time we got to the back deck, it was gone. Very strange. Probably a meteor, but?  Was between 8:15 and about 8:30 tonight Spokane Valley, near Pines rd and Trent.  I would love to know if anybody else saw this object.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
Star like objects in near space visible from Spokane Valley.;2017-07-04 21:45:00;15 minutes;Star like objects in near space visible from Spokane Valley. I observed two closely spaced (in time and space) sightings on July 4th.  First object crossed sky, a point source, star like, about the brightness of Saturn, following an arc from about Arcturus in Bootes across the face of the moon (or behind?) and disappeared near the planet Saturn.  Assuming the object fell into Earth’s shadow, it was slightly higher than LEO.  From the fact this object was noiseless, covered the distance in about 12 seconds and using the ISS for reference it was travelling about 80 miles/second, or about 5 times orbital escape velocity in LEO. The next series of star like objects occurred about 10:05 (p.m.?), when I noticed a bright object, about 5 moon widths to the west of Zubeneschamali in Libra, after noticing this first object, about the brightness of Saturn.  Within a second or two, two dimmer objects, the first about ½ degree north of Zubeneschamali, the second directly north about 3 moon widths.  The effect was to create an isosceles triangle, with the base composed of two dimmer stars and the brighter star at the apex forming a triangle pointing to the west.  The three objects slowly moved to the north, but disappeared before moving a Moon’s width (1/2 degree) and within 2-3 seconds of the 10:05 sighting of the apex star like object. I have verified there were NO satellites of sufficient magnitude to have been mistaken for the objects.  Neither were the objects asteroids or meteors, there was no ionization trail, and there are no visible Earth-crossing asteroids at this time.

I saw a small bright white light at high altitude a bit to the SE moving slowly from SE to NE.;2019-07-17 01:00:00;1 minute;I saw a small bright white light at high altitude a bit to the Southeast moving slowly from Southeast to Northwest. I walked outside to take the recycling to our bin and was looking at the moon in the South before catching the light peripherally to my left.  At first, I thought it to be the planet that has been in the night sky near the Moon as of late, but then realized it was in a different position than that.  I then thought maybe it was a plane as a good number of them fly over this area, but it seemed to be moving slower and there was no low rumble accompanying it.  I then concluded it must be a satellite.  That made perfect sense until the light slowly began to reduce in size and fade.  I took a few steps to my left to see around a tree branch, but it evanesced just after I caught sight of it again.  Perhaps it was just a meteor in the atmosphere?  Or ball lightning at a high altitude?  Seemed a bit lax in speed for those as well though.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
Giant Orange Orb;2020-05-22 03:11:00;10 min;Giant Orange Orb My husband woke me at 3:11am told me come outside. He and our daughter were having a snack in the kitchen and noticed a bright orange light to the southwest. We went outside and at first it was disk shaped but it turned out to be obscured by clouds. It was actually a GIANT ORANGE GLOBE. I MEAN GIANT.  It was bright bright orange but, the color was swirling and changing. There was a light that light was spinning horizontally. There was no physical craft, just light. The clouds were moving around it but it was stationary from our angle.  It eventually looked like it was moving away from us a disappeared to the west. This took 10 seconds. We watched for a total of 10 min. It was huge. I bet you can find a security camera that caught it.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
