Bright flashing light seen from afar on a mountain side .;2007-11-11 16:04:00;1 min 40sec;Bright flashing light seen from afar on a mountain side . The object was on the side of the mountain (which) was far away but visable. It appeared to be a bright light (cicle). It stayed in one place not moving one bit for about 1 min 40 sec. But getting smaller and fading as the seconds went on. On the video that I have caught it on it is a perfect circle and is flashing different colors. It eventually faded away completely. I've never seen a light or whatever it is on the mountain like that and it was odd to see it so bright like that during the day. I had walked outside of my 3rd floor apt to smoke a cig as I do multiple times through out the day and night and the first thing that caught my eye was the light. I should add that to my eyes it was stead in color and shape and not really any flashing. But on the video there is colors flashing. I after I went inside to upload it to my computer I heard weird beeping noises (not sure what it was or if that matters, it was just out of the ordinary) and it took a long time for my computer to recongnize i was trying upload something.  Which was weird I had to restart my computer to finally get it on. I have the video on the computer and my phone which i had recorded it. Let me know if you want it.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
Swarm of colored objects south of Spokane, WA.;2018-09-13 21:15:00;1-2 minutes;Swarm of colored objects south of Spokane, WA On the evening of September 13, 2018, at about 9:15 p.m., I stepped out on the porch in southeast Spokane county and saw what I first assumed were the navigation lights of a commercial flight heading toward the West coast.  I see these flights a lot, and most of those flights are at around 30,000’, and the red, blue and white flashing lights that I saw were at about that height.  Then, I noticed that these lights weren’t moving nearly as fast as expected, so I ran inside and grabbed the 10X binoculars.  With the binoculars I saw either many small lights on an immense object, or many objects flying in a choreographed manner.  There were many lights very close together, and those lights were pretty irregular in their flashing frequency, color and brightness.  These compacted lights were arranged in a rough semi-circle, which gave me the impression of an extremely large solid object.  But then I observed several small but bright lights moving independently of the rest.  One of these lights was a considerable distance away from the compacted lights, at least two to three miles away by my estimate.  That light was flashing a white color, and it only flashed twice that I saw. After watching these lights for about a minute, they seemed to be dimming.  But I then realized that the whole “swarm” of lights was moving West and away from my location.  Looking up I saw one of the regular commercial flights heading West, and in the general direction where the lights were.  It appeared that the lights started moving in response to the commercial jet. I say “swarm” because at that point the compacted lights appeared to be separating from each other as they moved away, with the independent lights trailing. Much like a swarm of insects might do. It seemed weird, but I really didn’t think much of it until yesterday when I watched this YouTube video apparently showing a “swarm” of objects over St. Petersburg, Russia, on September 13, 2018!:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPkbhQqaAsU   What is depicted in the video is similar to what I saw, but the object(s) that I saw were flashing different colors.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
I and other witnesses saw 6-8 lights moving in a single line across the northern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-24 01:00:00;5 minutes;I was having a campfire party and me and other witnesses saw 6-8 lights moving in a single line across the northern sky.  I saw them meet up with another light on the eastern horizon that reacted to them.  This other light was at rest in front of them then moved behind them and shortly after they all disappeared either from being too far in the horizon or something else.  The line of lights is substantiated by other people. The light they met up with them that reacted to them seems to only have been fully seen by me and maybe my close friend. They were no odd shape or color.  They all appeared as stars would in the night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667

Going West to East,(following I-90, my own sense of direction.)As it went closer, look it something was behind it, A plane but not really sure if there was something bind it. As its going a small V shape cam out on south side of it, no tip, connecting tailing the rest.it faded like everything when its far away.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
ISS “bracketed” by 4 moving objects that looked like regular stars..;2021-07-20 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;ISS “bracketed” by 4 moving objects that looked like regular stars.. Was floating in backyard pool, lights off, looking up at sky directly above me. Saw a slow steady bright “star or planet like object” heading from SE to NW. I thought it might be the ISS, and when I later went in I confirmed there was indeed a 6 min flyover that I just was lucky enough to catch. The unsettling part was when the ISS was directly over my head, I could see the stars behind it as it past by them, those stars (4 in this case) actually moved and absolutely “bracketed” the ISS as it moved across the sky. Almost like a targeted object in a scope. So the 4 “stars” were positioned at a (12, 3, 6 and 9:00 position) around the moving ISS. MOVING WITH THE ISS, the stars moved with it for almost 20 seconds. There were no clouds in the sky ( I made sure of it after the event), as sometimes moving clouds make stars look like the stars are moving. At the end of the “bracketing “ timeframe, the ISS moving towards the NW sky and I knew I’d lose it soon…but bef! ore the ISS was out of range, the 4 “bracketing stars” each moved outwards at same time from their prospective compass points (12:00 went up, 3:00 went right, etc) to form a larger bracketing diamond. Keep in mind they just looked like stars (same dimness as background stars in night sky), but just after they widened their bracket, the stars randomly moved in all directions and stopped dead in the sky, meanwhile ISS moved on to the horizon and started to dim. One last look at those “stopped” objects and they blinked out 2 at a time. First 2 just disappeared then within 1-2 seconds later, 2nd 2 blinked out. Couldn’t believe what I was watching and I know what I saw was not stars or my sight being weird. Would be interested to know if the ISS or radar picked up anything at that moment, since I know exactly time and area (based on ISS Flyover time and direction.;47.6627666666667;-117.213066666667
