unkown formations seen in mid-day;2007-04-22 16:00:00;17:00;unkown formations seen in mid-day Today my family and i saw formations of unknown flying objects in mid-day.  This sighting occured between 4:00 and 5:00 in the evening.  At first my boyfriends cousin saw what he thought were constilations in mid-day but as he kept looking at them the constilations kept moving into different formations.  These formations were changing pattern in groups of two's, three's and fours.  He came into the house and needed witness to what he had had seen.  When we joined him outside it appeared to be what he had descibed to us.  The patterns of light seemed to be hiding behind the clouds. During this time aircraft were in the vacinity and we were unsure if they had seen them.  A few minutes later we noticed a steamline of jets pass through the formations.  As they proceeded through the sky the formation of lights looked as if they had followed the streamline of the aircraft.  As the sky cleared, little by little the formations desinigrated until they were no longer visible.;46.4522;-120.4304
