WHAT IS THAT? I said to her what? thinking it was just fireworks I told her Aw come on. She said to me NO REALLY!  The boys come running out of the room.  I jumped off of the couch scaring our cat looked out the window and saw 4 orbs. As quick as I could I rushed outside to get a better look.  When I got outside,they were still there they were in an rhombus formation.  As I staired at them I knew from my experience that they were no kind of firework,so then I considered them to be some type of flare but they were not dropping as a flare would.;46.4522;-120.4304
