I know what I saw.;2010-07-04 23:00:00;4 or 5 minutes;I know what I saw. The object was like a fire in the sky.   At first, I thought was pieces of the fireworks display, the object began to pick up speed and never touched ground, came floating down from the smoke of the fireworks display, faciing North the object floated Southbound.  I was facing NW along the ocean front.  The object was orange/redish color, about the size of a basketball or beachball. It was between 22:00 Hrs. And 23:00 Hrs.  Only one object was observed as it came from the clouds without a sound.  My relatives and I observed the object that night.  I know someone else who saw it that happened to catch it on tape.  It was so cool.  Other than that, we had a clear sky in the night, a little cloudy, no rain.;47.3432;-124.2779
