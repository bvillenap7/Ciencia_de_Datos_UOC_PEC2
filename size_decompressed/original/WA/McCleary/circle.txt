Bright light spotted over Black Hills.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.  PD));2004-03-13 20:15:00;15 minutes;Bright light spotted over Black Hills. I was on my way home from my mother's house (1 mile from mine) and I saw what I thought was a bright star. It was located just west of the Black Hills. As I pullled into the driveway I realized it was larger than I thought and that it was very bright. It had sort of a yellow brightness instead of the stark white you would see in a star. I was amazed and could not take my eyes off of it. I finally called my mom to see if she could see it too. She did! I told her she had to come over and look at it from my house, as I have a clearing that provided a perfect view. I watched it about five minutes until she arrived. Once she arrived we watched it for another ten minutes or so. As I watched it seemed to pulse. We were able to pick out a refernce point right under the light that allowed us to measure the movement. It seemed to sway (or hover) just slightly. I also thought I saw some small lights to the out side of the circle. After it started to sway we noticed that it actually was getting smaller, as if it was moving away. Within about five seconds it was completely out of sight. I checked later but there was nothing. I realized how bright it made the sky, when I went back and could no longer see the hill it was positioned above.
