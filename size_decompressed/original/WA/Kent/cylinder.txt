My two girls and I were leaving family's house in Renton, heading toward Kent, when we saw a HUGE fiery-red object in the Southern sky.   The object was cylindrical in shape, had a very bright red, hazy aura around it, and as it descended, it seemed to stretch out, as if it were moving so fast it left a streak across the sky.  Before it dropped, it hovered for approximately 30 seconds while we watched.   I don't know how long it was there before we came upon it, but after about 30 seconds, maybe a little more, it rapidly shot downward to the ground.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
