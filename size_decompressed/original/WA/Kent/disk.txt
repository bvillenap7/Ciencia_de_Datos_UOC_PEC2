Had alternate flashing lights a round it, blue and green We were in the barn tending a sick foal when we heard our other horses panicking and running wildly in the pasture.  We ran outside to see what was going on and saw a saucer slowly and silently passing over our horses and then our barn.  It had alternately colored lights, blue and green I think, flashing (or pulsing?) around it. After it left the horses calmed right down. ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of three seemingly credible reports of overt sightings of a UFO by the same witness.  The witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.  PD));47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS 2 AIRPLANES BUT AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING WHY WOULD THEY BE THAT CLOSE? THE FIRST WAS TRAVELING NORTH,THE SECOND WAS HEADING EAST. THE THIRD CAME FROM THE WEST HEADING TO THE EAST. THEY WERE TRAVELING ERRACTICALLY, UP AND DOWN MOVEMENTS. EACH WAS EXACTLY THE SAME IN SIZE,EACH HAD TWINKLING RED AND WHITE LIGHTS. AS I WATCHED,THE ONE TRAVELING NORTH HEADED OFF TO THE WEST. THE TWO HEADING EAST CONTINUED. THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR AND HAD NO WIND. THERE WAS NO SOUND COMING FROM ANY OF THEM. THE SAHPE OF THEM APPEARED TO BE DISK ALTOUGH I DIDN'T SEE ANY OUTLINE,THE LIGHTS WERE BANDED TOGETHER IN A ALMOST RECTANGULAR SHAPE. THE FIRST OBJECT TURNED AND HEADED NORTH,TOWARD MY HOUSE.THE TWINKLING RED AND WHITE LIGHTS TURNED TO THREE VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS IN A TRIANGULAR SHAPE. I STILL SEE NO DEFINED SHAPE. I GO INSIDE AND LOOK OUT MY FRONT WINDOW AND SEE THE OBJECT GO OVER,CHANGING BACK TO THE RED AND WHITE LIGHTS. FEELING RATHER SHAKEN, I GO TO BED.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Observed three stationary/almost stationary UFO's emitting variety of colors in clear skies;1999-11-04 22:50:00;3 mins;Observed three stationary/almost stationary UFO's emitting variety of colors in clear skies I was driving from Seattle to Kent on I-5 last night with my wife and 18 month old. It was 10:50 PM last night, cold and very clear night when I was about a mile from my exit Kent Des Moines Rd off I-5(not far from SeaTac airport), I noticed three sets of lights - two of them together and one a little further away - which were stationary and looked like street lights. I discarded the possibility that they were plane lights because the lights were stationary.I pointed it out to my wife, and as we got closer we realized they were neither street lights nor plane lights, well at least not man made. When I took the exit and was waiting at the signal light, I could clearly see one of the two objects that were together right above me. The object was moving very slowly ESE to WNW almost stationary above me and was not making any noise. It was like a disc, and I could see different colors - white, yellow, green/blue, same goes with my wife she had  a better look than me because my eyes were on the road. She was kinda worried at the signal light and wanted me to drive away quickly, I guess she didn't want to be kidnapped by them. So I didn't go back to get another look and we couldn't notice the objects as I headed east after taking the exit and descended down Kent west hill on Kent Des Moines Rd. But we both were pretty sure it was nothing man made, because those objects were pretty stationary and were floating in the sky like a leaf.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
