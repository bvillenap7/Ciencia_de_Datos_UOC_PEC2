Black Triangle over Kent, WA;2002-12-18 19:30:00;25 seconds;Black Triangle over Kent, WA This sighting was Wednesday, Dec 18th. Approximately 7:30 PM. East hill of Kent, WA. I had just been on the phone with my girlfriend ( approx 7:15 ) who was driving north on 405 near Renton and she had told me of three lights she saw in sky which she thought was peculiar. Moments later I'd left my apartment and was walking to the laundry room with my laundry. The skies were very clear. I heard a sound which was like a high pitch whirr mixed with a low resonating hum...I thought the sound was coming from the laundry room. Just then I watched a large black triangle gliding above the trees just to the east of me and maybe a 1000 ft up or so. It was as big or bigger than a 747 but moving half as fast as one that close might be moving. It was only a couple blocks to the east but still pretty much overhead and I clearly saw the dome shaped white lights on each corner and a red light in the middle. The red light may have been rotating or maybe a smokey half dome shape was over it rotating. I could tell the sound was coming from it but was weird, kind of resonating. Not a very loud sound either, and not one I've heard before. I watched it gliding north behind the trees and staying smooth and steady. As it moved away I could discern the thickness of the craft. Gliding overhead took about 5 or 6 seconds I'd guess, but I continued to watch it through the trees for maybe 20 seconds. After putting my laundry in, I went back to my car and drove around up on the hill a little but it was gone from sight by then. I don't see how hundreds of people didn't see that. I believe the triangle was equilateral in shape. I observed many airplanes after that, not even the same. The white lights on the corners were steady and bright, but not necessarily unearthly. The object didn't seem to be affected by gravity, I had no impression it had weight. I attached a photoshop rendering of what I saw against the type of night sky that evening. I also attached a map showing it's approximate location and direction. My girlfriend's sighting put the lights north of my location about ten minutes earlier, yet I saw the objec! t headin g north towards her location. Either it had gone south and turned around or there may have been more than one out that night. Earlier in the evening, the freeway had been blocked by police activity (south of this location in Federal Way) involving a car chase and then the search for two suspects which had escaped on foot. By this time of the evening, the search had just been called off, the suspects had escaped. This might be relevant to the assumption that the black triangle is a surveillance craft.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Transparent triangle over Kent Washington;2004-05-24 00:10:00;2 sec;Transparent triangle over Kent Washington Monday May 24, 2004 at 12:10am I witnessed while I was walking my dog what I can best describe as a transparent triangle sail over my head.  It was barely visible and I  thought at first it was a sky search light but it had two distinct leading edges and did not travel in an arc as most search lights do. There was also no clouds for lights to reflect off of and I could see the stars.  The shape traveled South to North rapidly and covered an arc of 90 degrees in about two seconds so that I turned around to  watch it disappear in the opposite direction. There was no sound.   The size was about the size of a small plane if you were to witness a plane take off at the end of a runway. ((NUFORC Note:  We know this witness well, and she telephone NUFORC just minutes after her sighting.  We suspect she is an excellent witness.  The fact that the object had no lights on it makes it a very unusual event, we believe.  PD));47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Kent,wa. duration-15sec. flying from east to west, Triangular, lights on the three tips, red light on the bottom, huge;2006-07-20 23:45:00;15seconds;Kent,wa. duration-15sec. flying from east to west, Triangular, lights on the three tips, red light on the bottom, huge Triangler object, was moving from east to west. I couldnt hear any noise from whatever it was. It looked like to me that the object was flying quite low.It had lights on the three sides, and one red light on the bottom. About 30 seconds later, a commercial aircraft flew right over our place, this time I heard the noise from the engines.....

white light    triangle      clear skies over hous eclouds to the south fast flying craft at night time zigg zag;2008-07-29 02:00:00;1HR;Kent , Wa               white light    triangle      clear skies over hous eclouds to the south fast flying craft at night time zigg zag I get home about 12:00a.m from my job. I spend a few hours on my deck where you can see aircraft landing at seatac airport on a routine basis. They are easy to identify by there warning lights. This however had no warning lights and was shaped like a oval on a rectangle with a bright white light. I tried to rationalize what it might be right away, but before i could think of anything else it might be it made a staight line of flight west about 5 miles in a split second. I dropped all rational thought and knew what I was seeing. for about 20min the craft zigged around in a 10 mile area and at one point dissapeared south at a alarming speed and came back closer than before. This is how I hear stories told on TV but my god I was there!!! I dont know if I should keep telling this? I know what I saw and I cant even convince myself. I went back in to wake my girlfriend and she is a huge skeptic. When she saw it and its movement she was in disbelief and scared and insisted on going back inside. It is now 3:35 and I am typing this to the first sight I found they are real and I know nobody will beleve me. To end this the craft dissapeared south west in a zigg zagging pattern at about 2:50 it was completely out of sight.

Craft seen in Kent, Wa.;2009-07-11 01:05:00;2-4 minutes;Craft seen in Kent, Wa. Tonight I was over at a friend's house stargazing as we do often when the weather permits. The weather was warm and clear. The moon was 3/4 full with Jupiter off to it's right. Three of the four moons of Jupiter were visible. My friend's house lies under the flight path for planes going into Seatac when they have to fly south to circle around to land going north. It's also under a flight path for planes that are going to Boeing Field from the south.  Needless to say, we see a lot of planes on any given night that we stargaze. We also usually see one of the Guardian helicopters from the King County Sheriff's Department flying around, so we are both very familiar with the aircraft in this area. At approximately 1:00am when Coast to Coast took a commercial break, my friend went into his house to use the bathroom. A few minutes later I decided to stand up to stretch my legs. We sit on his porch facing due East, so when I stood up, that's the direction I was facing. I saw a bright pulsing light directly ahead of me. My first thought was that it was a private plane with it's landing lights on heading in my direction. Private planes' landing light pulse on and off as they come in for a landing, but the color was wrong and I couldn't detect any forward motion. The color of the light was sort of amber yet at the same time it was like a mixture of red and white light, but not pink. As if the red and white light was swirled together. I could detect both colors at the same time although it appeared as one light. The motion that I could detect was a gentle back and forth motion and at the same time a gentle up and down motion. It was erratic yet seemed under control. I grabbed my binoculars, Celestron Skymaster 15x70s, and looked at it. It appeared much closer, but otherwise appeared exactly the same. I was pretty sure that this wasn't a plane, so I flashed a small flashlight at it. I didn't notice any reaction from the object. I then grabbed my friends big flashlight which I believe is a 2.5 million candle power light. I flashed it twice in the direction of the object. I'm not sure if it was coincidence or not, but the object moved slightly to the right behind a tree. I had to move to my left a few feet to be able to see it again through the tree. After about 30 seconds the object started moving to the left. When it did this I could see that the pulsing light was a white light at the rear of the object, based on direction of travel. There was a non pulsing white light at the front of the object and there were 3 non pulsing red lights visible. As the object came out from behind the tree moving North, I flashed the big flashlight at it a couple of more times. Again, I don't know if it was coincidence or not, but the object accelerated. It was a very quick yet smooth acceleration. This is when I realized that the object was not as far away as I had first thought. I had been thinking that it appeared to be very far away, but now it appeared as if it was only a few thousand feet away, perhaps closer. Without knowing the size of the object it's hard to tell at night. As the object moved what appeared to be North, I would lose sight of it for a few seconds as it went behind trees, but I quickly realized that it was now heading West, or perhaps WNW towards Tukwilla. It accelerated again, very smoothly, and I lost sight of it when it went behind a neighboring house. When I looked at it with the binoculars as it was traveling westerly, I was looking at it from the side, so I could not tell what shape it was, but I got the impression it was triangular. I saw no wings and no tail section and it was totally silent. From it's apparent size and distance, I should have easily heard it. Guardian One at that distance would have been very loud and easily identifiable as we have seen it on many occasions fly by at that apparent altitude and distance.  The only problem is that whatever this was, was way faster than Guarding One and made no noise.  As a matter of fact, Guardian One just flew over my apartment as I am writing this. It was quite noisy and can be heard a great distance away. It was also much too fast for a private plane, which we had fly over us not very long before this sighting.  Again, the private plane was easily heard and identified.  For it to have been a commercial plane, which we see several every night, including tonight, the pilot would have had to have been making an emergency landing since he was only flying about 20 degrees off of the horizon.  At the estimated distance a a few thousand feet, it would have been incredibly loud.  I also estimate that it was only a few hundred feet in altitude. I feel like I'm rambling, so I'm going to end this.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Triangle UFO witnessed in Kent, Washinton at about 1am on Wednesday morning, 8/11/10.;2010-08-11 01:00:00;10 seconds;Triangle UFO witnessed in Kent, Washinton at about 1am on Wednesday morning, 8/11/10. Quiet/Silent UFO with 3 glowing amber lights in a triangle formation and one glowing amber light between the two rear amber lights.  The UFO also has 2 bright white strobe lights down the middle of the triangle at opposing ends. On Wednesday at about 1am,  August 11,  2010, I was getting out of my truck at work and quickly glanced at an aircraft flying overhead at a low altitude from the south heading toward the north.  At first, I thought that it was a commercial jet, yet as I took a moment to focus my gaze, I realized that there was something unusual about it.   I see commercial jets and helicopters flying over head at times, but I didn’t hear any sound from this flying object and that the lights displayed didn’t fit the description of a plane or helicopter that I’ve seen before.  The UFO travelled at a steady pace similar to a commercial jet until it faded in the distance.  I witnessed this UFO cross overhead from the south heading toward the north for about 10 seconds until it was out of my sight.  I would say that looking north, the UFO was heading north with a slight 10-20 degrees toward the northwest. Other than witnessing the UFO, I did notice a helicopter passing overhead shortly before this sighting.  As I witnessed the UFO, the helicopter appeared further north and from the west.   It stopped in the direction the UFO was heading.  The UFO continued north past the helicopter out of my sight while the helicopter slowly followed it until it too was out of my sight.
