Flashing Light Blue/Red bouncing up and down in horizen, very bright;1999-06-12 23:45:00;3 min;Flashing Light Blue/Red bouncing up and down in horizen, very bright To the north of our house, I heard a helicopter, so looked out the window for it and saw this bouncing light.  At first I thought it was the helichopter, but moving too fast, so I went outside and saw this bright triangle shaped (three white lights) with a blue flashing light and sometimes flashed into red, then changed to almost all red.  It moved in a bounce, up and down to the left, then right, very quickly, very fast because it seemed to jump without movement.  I ran inside to get my Mom and a camera and by time I was back out, it was moving north into the low horizen into Seattle.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Bright lights seen moving in the sky executing 90 degree turns, and flickering colors between red, blue, and bright white.;2001-01-16 00:30:00;1 hour;Bright lights seen moving in the sky executing 90 degree turns, and flickering colors between red, blue, and bright white. After lying down in bed I noticed a light streaking outside my window out of the corner of my eye. I opened the blinds all the way, and thought I was seeing shooting stars until noticing that their direction was odd. They looked light very bright stars, and one in particular was moving up and down, side to side stopping on a dime, and moving from one axis to the other at 90 degree angles. I called a friend that lives a few miles away, and he witnessed the same thing. A second person that was in the house with me witnessed the same thing. These objects were located in the sky at about a 45-degree angle from view (elevation) and South Southwest to the left and slightly below Orion's Belt (I think). There was a triangular constellation of similar objects to the left and slightly below the initial object that were moving around also, but they were dimmer. The objects resembled stars, but seemed to change from bright white to red and blue. They were also flickering between colors. It seemed as though the object left a small trail at times, and sometimes it looked like two stars connected by a thin beam of light before they merged into a single light source. I watched the objects for about 90 minutes before going back to bed. I thought that this object could possibly be a satellite. I have a high quality video camera tonight, and will tape the sky if this happens again. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness describes two bright planets, Jupiter and Saturn, that would be in that part of the sky at that hour.  PD));47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
orange orb;2009-02-16 02:00:00;2 seconds;orange orb early morning, 2:00 am or so, saw orange light out kitchen window as it shot over the treeline out of sight. thought it was a shooting star, but it was distinctly orange, perfectly spherical, and left no streak behind it like a meteor would, and it didnt move right for a meteorite, too slow. but way faster than any plane.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
fast moving ball of light variable speed and brillant  light that faded away before the horizon.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS sighting.  PD));2009-07-16 10:22:00;1 min 30 sec;fast moving ball of light variable speed and brillant  light that faded away before the horizon i was smoking a cigarette and looking out my window and a bright light about 2 times the size of venus when visible caught my eye, it was stationary or to slow to seem to be moving, the light was of constant intensity with no red or blue shift the light was just brilliant white i noticed it moving slowly and the object picked up speed it was moving about half as fast as a shooting star, now a close object like a fighter jet doesnt appear to be moving all that quickly and a shooting star is like a bullet and a sattelite is also a fast moving object but as far as i know they dont change speed in orbit,but this object at full speed wasnt as fast as a sattelite and it sped up and slowed down then the light started to fade and it was gone i could see a few stars but they were very dim, in the city there is alot of light so star gazing isnt easy thats why this object stood out so much in the sky.and about a half an hour after the sighting i saw lots of strobing aircraft lights but the airspace the planes were in was not a normal commercial flight path i may see one or two planes a day to the east of my house not 4 or five at once ,  i belive there has to be life in the universe but also i know people can completly misidentify things like i did when i saw a b2 spirit flying at night a large dark triangle with no light has to be a ufo,but then i saw it in daylight and it was so obviously a plane. I dont want to make a big deal out of nothing but if there are other reports like this from washington i am willing to talk to anyone there who wants to listen thanks;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Looking exactly like Jupiter in night sky, a light appeared high in sky at time of ISS orbiting above, speeds across, vanishes, it exhi;2009-09-13 20:17:00;1 second;Looking exactly like Jupiter in night sky, a light appeared high in sky at time of ISS orbiting above, speeds across, vanishes, it exhi A light suddenly appeared high above, looking exactly like it could have been the planet Jupiter, almost directly overhead but slightly to the east, traveled from north to south in a flash just as if it had been hit by a baseball bat.  I’m guessing it may have traveled a sky distance of two to three degrees or about one seventh to one sixth of the sky immediately above me.  It had the same magnitude and appearance of Jupiter in the night sky, absolutely no difference.  I saw it for a split second or so and then it was gone, without fading in magnitude or changing in appearance.  Its brightness was consistent without any fluctuation.  It disappeared in the same form as it had appeared.  It displayed no streak, tail or any kind of trail or smoke.  It was a singular light and moved across the sky incredibly fast.  I observed it because I was watching the ISS moving from NW to NE that evening in my backyard.  The ISS had reached its zenith in the northern sky wh! en the ISS went behind a tall fir tree and while I waited for it to re-emerge (which it didn’t by the way) the unexplained light appeared about a degree away just to the south of the location of where I last saw the ISS.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Dominating red light seen twice, then 8 more white, yellow, and orange colored lights were moving in formations, then each disappeared.;2014-07-04 23:30:00;5 minutes;Dominating red light seen twice, then 8 more white, yellow, and orange colored lights were moving in formations, then each disappeared. Late around 11:00pm after the fireworks show at the nearby lake had finished, I started looking at the sky and remaining fireworks, but what caught my attention right away was a red light whizzing around in figure eights at the left side of the road beside the lake, which at first I thought was a drone.  It was in the direction southwest. Then I met two friends which I was telling about the red light, and some underground knowledge and they then pointed out in the same direction, lights in the sky that look like UFO’s.  I walked up a slope and the two friends followed to get a better view, and they appeared to be coming from the right, so that we could be more able to see them from the trees in front of us.  There were 9 glowing lights, colored white, light yellow, light orange, and then the one red one I saw earlier, the red being the brightest and largest looking. The red one was the farthest behind coming into view after the white, yellow, orange lights started moving into formations.  Then came the red light from the right, from the tree line, moving more towards the formatting lights.  Once the red one was getting into view and looked more like a V, one by one did the lights disappear, until there was only a few lights flickering, and dissipating, while the red one was moving toward them, in a curve, going up into the sky, then disappeared.  After all this, around 4 am, I had psychological hallucinations, like rainbow fractal crystals and static with lights on the ceiling.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Very rapid point of white light zips across night sky, then stops abruptly and remains static like the stars around it.;2017-07-01 23:50:00;~2.5 minutes;Very rapid point of white light zips across night sky, then stops abruptly and remains static like the stars around it. I am a 50 year old male who has enjoyed camping and stargazing since I was a kid.  In that time, I have watched countless satellites cross the sky, and am very familiar with their relative brightness and speed, and that most of them tend to move along an equatorial route instead of a polar route.  I am also very familiar with the ISS, and use a phone app that tracks its orbit. On July 1, 2017, the skies were clear.  I was outside moving items out of my brother's Dodge Siesta RV, which was parked at a rural residence between Kent and Auburn, Washington.  Among the items was a pair of Jason brand binoculars, 50x magnification.  They are powerful enough to see the 4 largest moons of Jupiter on a clear night. I had been bending and lifting boxes, so I decided to take a break by laying on my back across the hood of my car and use the binoculars for stargazing.  Within seconds, I caught sight of what I first thought was a satellite moving from south to north in a straight line.  Immediately I knew it couldn't be a satellite because of its incredible speed, yet it was too slow to be a meteor.  Typically, if I keep the binoculars still (not panning to follow movement) and let a satellite cross my field of view, it takes between 15 to 20 seconds to cross depending on my angle of perspective.   This object passed the binocular's field of view in about 4 seconds.  Assuming that directly above my head is 0 degrees, the object was about 20 degrees eastward of my location.  It appeared like most satellites a single point of white light like a star moving in a straight line.  The light reflecting off it was as bright as the average star.  I listened for the sound of jets, but heard nothing.  I figured it had to be a military jet, but a jet appearing as a single point of light through 50x magnification would have to be at an extremely high altitude, and this object was moving far too fast to be a jet at such a distance.   I tracked the object's movement for about 20 to 25 seconds.  Then it stopped.  It didn't gradually slow to a stop.  It stopped the way an Indy 500 car stops when it hits a granite wall.  I kept the binoculars trained on the point of light for a couple more minutes, but it sat motionless like it was just another star. I told my brother what I had just witnessed, and he directed me to your sight to file a report.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

I saw a bright light shooting down from the sky toward the ground.  It disappeared behind the houses that were in my view.  I expected to hear a crash, but there was no sound.  It was fast and silent. Shooting star?  Not sure.  There were several commercial jets flying their usual flight paths higher and slower than this object, so they surely must have seen it.  I am curious to see if there will be other reports during the same evening and what they saw.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
A bright star that when approached revealed itself as a hovering airplane-like object, but no flashing lights;2017-12-07 17:20:00;2 minutes;A bright star that when approached revealed itself as a hovering airplane-like object, but no flashing lights I was driving home from work going east on 212th St.  As I was approaching 76th Ave S, I saw a bright star in the sky shining through the trees.  I turned south on 76th Ave S and saw a small, fast moving airplane pass pretty quickly underneath the object.  It was hovering very close, just to the west side of 76th Ave S.   As I got closer, the object looked like a large airplane with a bright headlight, and a few lights on the bottom of it, but there were no flashing lights.  It was not a helicopter, more like an airplane.   It hovered there very close, perfectly still, as if it was watching traffic.  I watched it as I drove south.  Eventually I passed it and lost sight of it.  It just kept hovering stationary there and never moved.   I have seen this type of object far off in the distance before during this time of evening in Kent, but never this close.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
