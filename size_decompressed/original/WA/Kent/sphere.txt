However, my cousin and I were looking at the moon with a telescope.   We seen a bright object that was moving from left to right side of the sky.  It was the biggest object second to only the moon.  As we staried at it... it started coming closer to us. It got so close it was about 50 feet up.  It was amazing.  No sound .. and this is what we seen.  Round object .. made of entire light and liquid.  Liquid was in the center of this round object.  The liquid was spinning vertical.   We were trying to make scence of it.  My cousin is deaf.. but we were mind blown with this.  I wanted to contact someone to tell this story and hear if anyone else in the Kent wa area in the year 1997 has reported this.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

I was looking in a S-SW direction of about 210 degrees The above description is as about as detailed a description as I have.  The object resembled a roman candle ball but it was moving horizontally and was the size of 1/5 to 1/8 of a full moon sized disc.  I did not lhear any sound but I was indoors at the time of viewing.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
I really saw a dark grey sphere hovering motionless then moved slowly got smaller and dissapeared!!!!!;2002-09-27 19:30:00;6 1/2 min;I really saw a dark grey sphere hovering motionless then moved slowly got smaller and dissapeared!!!!! I noticed that my report is faulty on the date of occured. last week of september 2002,I know this because prior to my sighting I read a article in the local newspaper about a hot air balloon crossing mount rainier.A few days later is when I saw the dark grey sphere. My original post is dated 1/17/2004 under the shape oval I made a mistake because I didnt see the category for sphere and at that time I thought anythig round is oval. Today I typed in dark grey hot air balloons to see if there is such a thing and I clicked on ufo sightings on maar two a's, and read a article about how 200 plus people saw the exact same thing as i did.dated 7/2/2004 downtown area of henderson north carolina at 8:18pm while watching music event. You dont know how happy that makes me. you dont know all the questions you start asking yourself after youve seen what i saw. for example If god were to appear what shape would he be. what is the most perfect shape in the universe? what color, I mean really,a purple square? AND IF YOU SEE HIM WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,oOOIIIEEEE NOT GOOD. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
This was a spherical object adjacent to an airplane contrail;2005-02-01 09:25:00;3 min;This was a spherical object adjacent to an airplane contrail I was on my back deck observing through binoculars an airplane approaching from the south laying down a contrail when I noticed a spherical object adjacent to the contrail (it was slightly east of the trail if the object was at the same altitude) and about 5 degrees behind the plane.  The object was dark except for a lighted area in the lower lefthand quadrant.  The lighted area was changing from silver to orange and back at a rate of about 5 to 7 seconds per cycle.  I observed this object for about three minutes and it appeared to be stationary with respect to the contrail and was at about 60 degrees off of the horizon slightly west of due south.  I pulled the binoculars away from my eyes expecting to see it with the naked eye but could not and was not able to locate it thereafter.  I called the Renton Airport to see if they had observed anything on radar at that time.  They explained that their radar does not have the range to locate anything in that area (South Kent to North Auburn) and directed me to the Seattle Air Traffic Center.  I called them and left a message but have not heard back at this time.  The person I talked with at the Renton Airport was very interested and asked if I would give him a call back if anything was noted by the Seattle Center.  By way of background I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
loud orange ufo buzzes kent, wa. again;2009-04-24 04:14:00;30 seconds;loud orange ufo buzzes kent, wa. again I was laying in bed and started to feel strangely panicked.  I thought maybe somone had broken into the house, it was a wierd feeling. then there was a slow rumbling sound, not uncommon living in kent which is somewhat near the airport. having seen and reported a previous sighting I jumped out of bed and looked out my window. I jokingly thought to myself I wonder what my response to seeing this thing again would be... and then yelled a profanity as a orange blob of light- obscured by the overcast sky- shot over my neighborhood with a rumble like that of a commercial plane. I sat dumfounded for about 20 minutes staring in the direction it had gone. then Iwent downstairs and got my digital camera and set it to record video, and waited perched in my window sill intill the sun started to come up.  I was so sure the first sighting I reported had to be ball lightning as i dont believe in aliens. but the probability of somone seeing somthing as impossibly rare as ball lightning twice in a 6 month period seems unlikely. so my only guess is it has to be boeing. theyre right up the street, and next gen things are always shockingly strange before they are made public. but ive got my camera ready now. one other thing, it was distinctly orange, as was the first one I saw, but the first one was way faster, and completely silent, this one rumbled the house like a jet would, but it was only a few hundred feet up, and I think getting buzzed by say a military jet would have been louder.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

Three circular red objects in triangular formation;2014-02-01 19:00:00;1:30;Three circular red objects in triangular formation On Saturday, February 1st , I went outside on my deck to get my cat inside.  It was approximately 7:00PM.  There is a wooded area behind our house. I saw three circular red lights in the distance. They weren’t moving like planes, so I assumed that they were perhaps military helicopters.  I estimate that their altitude was perhaps 2,000 feet.  The other reason that I thought they were helicopters was that they seemed fairly close together, as opposed to how planes would be.  There was cloud cover and the lights were below the clouds. I didn’t think much of the lights until I noticed that they weren’t moving.  They were in a triangular formation with one light at the top, another light below it and to the left and a third light to the right of the second light and a bit below it.  I still thought that they must be helicopters at this point and I kept watching because it was unusual to see three of them flying together. At that point, the uppermost light moved in an unusual way.  From my viewpoint, it moved down and then to the left, toward the second light.  It remained there for just a couple of seconds and then went to the right and up to it’s original position as the top light in the triangle.  This movement was very fast and struck me as being unusual for a helicopter.  Both times that it moved, both going down and back up again, it followed what could be described as a reverse ‘L’ shape.  For example, it moved down and then moved to the left at a 90 degree angle.  After that, it followed the same path in reverse, moving quickly to the right and then moving up at 90 degrees to get to it’s original position. After seeing that movement, it finally occurred to me that they might not be helicopters. Other than The top light, the other two had not moved for over a minute.  I thought that it would be unusual for Three helicopters to maintain position for that long.  Also, there were no blinking navigation lights. Just solid red lights. I listened carefully for any noise of helicopters, but there was none.   Three helicopters that close and at that low altitude would have made noise. I grabbed my iPhone that was nearby and started taking what I intended to be a video, but as it turned out, there are just still photos.  I have three photos of the lights and also the trees in the foreground.  I went inside to get my girlfriend and have her look.  I was inside for perhaps 10 seconds.  When we both got out to the deck, only one of the lights remained. After a few seconds, it was no longer visible.  My thought was that it went above the cloud cover and could no longer be seen.  The other two lights may have done the same thing while I was inside.  The photos show three very defined circular red lights. The defined circular shape was another thing that made me think they might not be helicopters because navigation lights would be blinking and have more of a starburst type effect as opposed to being circular.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
