Reddish orange glowing lights in an orb shape.;2014-01-25 19:30:00;5 minutes;Reddish orange glowing lights in an orb shape. My wife and I saw at least six reddish orange glowing orb objects over the southern Puget sound area.  They changed numbers and formation slowly.  The Youtube video on your page from Japan is exactly what we saw.  The contrast was to much for my camera and it only recored one dot of light. I am a high school teacher and my wife is a flight attendant.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
