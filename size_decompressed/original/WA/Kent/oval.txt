Called Renton air traffic control tower. Woman on duty had seen object too. Described it as flying across whole Southern horizon, no noise, glowing. Wondered if anyone else had seen it, as I was her first caller about it. See summary description.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

Two glowing orange objects slowly moved north to south over Kent Washington, then one accellerated south and the other went straight up;2009-07-05 00:25:00;2 minutes;Two glowing orange objects slowly moved north to south over Kent Washington, then one accellerated south and the other went straight up At 0:25 PDT on July 5th, 2009, nere the corner of 224th St. and 116th Ave. SE in Kent, WA, myself and two other people saw a glowing object in the sky just north of us moving due south.  It had no lights on it, but it glowed red-orange and pulsated.  We all thought it was a plane on fire.   Then we noticed there was a second identical object following behind the first one on the same course at the same altitude.  They passed over our heads and when they were just south of us the leading one accelerated and dissapeared behind the trees.  Simultaneously, the second one seemed to go straight up.  From our view it just shrank, getting smaller and smaller until we could no longer see it. this manuver took less than ten seconds.  Until the end they were moving a little slower than the other planes we had seen all day, and on a different flight path.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
