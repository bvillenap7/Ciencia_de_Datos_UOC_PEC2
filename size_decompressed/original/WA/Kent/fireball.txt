(9-PM), and a very small object passed me flying overhead at a high rate of speed on a steep downward angle flying out of the south to the north. The sun just set behind the Olympic Mtns., which really gave me a great view. This object was omitting a long firey green tail. It either burned up and or disappeared over Lake Washington, in the east Seattle/north Renton area. My guess is it was a meteorite???;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Large fireball streaking across the sky over Highway 167 in Kent WA.;2011-11-15 19:32:00;30 Seconds;Large fireball streaking across the sky over Highway 167 in Kent WA. I was driving on Highway 167 through Kent and saw a large fireball with a tail and shooting what appeared to be sparks out the back end of it.  It was streaking about 300 feet above the ground.   I am guessing others saw it.  Down the freeway about 4 miles I saw cars parked along the side of the freeway heading NorthBound and the occupants were out of the cars looking up at something.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

Bright orange lights.;2014-08-23 22:00:00;3 minutes;Around 10 pm tonight I went out to grab something from my jeep.I noticed approximetly 5 bright orange lights in a wide cluster and 1 off to the east of them.  At first I thought they were floating or hovering until I realized they were getting smaller but not moving off into the horizon.  Whatever it was headed straight up and out of our atmosphere like a missle or rocket.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Reddish Orange Fireball like lights streaking across the sky  barely about the trees, without making any sound.;2014-12-25 21:30:00;~5 minutes;Reddish Orange Fireball like lights streaking across the sky  barely about the trees, without making any sound It was around 9:30 PM and I was just returning home from picking up my sister at my brotherâ€™s house.  I was parking the car in the driveway and when I got out of the car, I noticed several reddish orange fireball like lights streaming across the sky very low, just barely above the tree line it seemed.   I quickly told my sister who was getting out of the car as well, and she looked up and saw what I was seeing.  We watched them fly across the sky from the south heading north.   After the first group went, I looked back and saw that more were approaching as well.  The objects did not appear to be making any sound at all as they flew across the sky.   I watched them fly by in the distance and they appeared to be getting smaller and then started to look like stars in the sky in the distance.  I am not for sure, but it almost seemed like they were going upward into the sky at that point and not across.   My sister took pictures with her cell phone and posted the photos on her Facebook page.    I also called family and friends startled by what I had witnessed and told them about the experience.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Two solid fireball shaped orbs flew above fireworks for approximately 15 seconds at approximately 10,000'.  ((anonymous report));2019-07-04 22:03:00;15 seconds;Two solid fireball shaped orbs flew above fireworks for approximately 15 seconds at approximately 10,000 feet before vanishing. During 4th of July fireworks, a big fireball shaped orb came from the northwest over lake Morton and disappeared in the middle of the open sky about 15 seconds after observed.  I filmed the object, and after the first disappeared... 30 seconds later a second came from the same spot, and disappeared in approximately the same location.

Passenger airplane has to make quick deviation to avoid collision with fireball shaped orb.;2019-07-05 00:04:00;2 minutes;Passenger airplane has to make quick deviation to avoid collision with fireball shaped orb. I had just submitted a report about 15 minutes before we saw this last fireball light.  This fireball light was similar to the previous one I reported (fireball).  It lifted above the horizon from the northeast, and slowly traveled south before stopping in the sky.  We live close to Sea-Tac airport, and noticed it stoped in the flight path of departing airplanes to the west.   I filmed the object, and within 45 seconds a airplane came into the frame of video heading right towards the fireball shaped light.  As the plane approached the light, it made a obvious and deliberate deviation away from the light.  I have this on video.  The airplane left the frame of video, while the fireball light remained.  The light stayed visible for approximately 30 seconds more before vanishing.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
