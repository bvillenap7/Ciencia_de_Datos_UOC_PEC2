UFO shaped oval shaped, sort of like rain drop up side down, black with iridecent red glow.  Object was approx. 1000 feet to 500 feet altitude.  Object was observed approx 1/2 mile distant and coming on a direct line over the back yard.  It did not pass directly overhead,but at about 80 degrees (10 degrees to the right of overhead).  Air speed was about 150 knots, (not like an air balloon which drifts with the wind), it was still day, no clouds, winds aloft were negligble. Object approached from the north and continued due south, no sounds.  I am retired from the U.S. Air Force and have 3500 flight hours in the B-52 aircraft.  In all the years of flying, I never observed any UFO sightings.  Myself and my 3 brothers, my 12 year old son and my 11 year old nephew.  My age at the time was 44 years old, brothers all in the same age range. My vision is 20/20 at the time. I had been retired from the USAF three years.  All of us witnessed this sighting.  I did not report this at the time as I did not know who to call.  I did call the FAA at the time, but they had no radar returns on the local SEA/TAC radar.  I and my brothers swear to this sighting as we have nothing to gain from this report.  You may contact me via email.........

After, the plane flew over my head at about 1,000 feet in evelation, I noticed an object teardrop shaped flying about 1,000 feet above where the jet had just flown over.   I had 4 co-workers working near me outside, and I yelled, and pointed the object out to them! None of us knew what it was?  This object was traveling slow, but gaining altitude.  We watched it for about 4 minutes, it was traveling about 30 knots. It was a partly overcast night, with the sun starting to set.   The object was opposite the sun in the sky. There was no lights, fire, sounds, and it was traveling against the wind heading from the north to the south, but slowly gaining attitude as it looked to be just gliding along.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
