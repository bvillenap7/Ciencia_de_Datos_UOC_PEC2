Bright craft slowly came toward me from over the neighbor's house (thought it was a star at first);2003-05-06 23:00:00;about 3 minutes;Bright craft slowly came toward me from over the neighbor's house (thought it was a star at first) I couldn't sleep for a little bit so I went out to our living room.  One of our cats was in the window so I sat in the chair next to her and petted her for a minute when I noticed what I thought was a bright star or planet in the distance, above our neighbor's house, that I hadn't seen before.  Intrigued by how bright it was, I looked closer then noticed it was coming closer.  Then I made out a row of bright yellow lights on top with a red light on the bottom right corner and a blue light on the bottom left corner. I opened the window so I could hear what type of noise was coming from this flying craft, but didn't hear anything, but my other cat jumped up in the window and growled. It just got closer and closer until it was finally up overhead and going over me quite a distance above me (between airplane level and where a helicopter would be if it were looking for someone). It was then I heard a sound that didn't sound anything like an airplane or helicopter, but it was a familiar low-pitched sound almost like a pod in StarWars (kind of sounded like it was under water almost).;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
One small blue light moving extreamly fast;2009-07-30 00:00:00;1-2 seconds;One small blue light moving extreamly fast I was in the back of my friends property around mid night, I was outside with his cousins, but they went in a few minutes earlier. We both looked up, a blue light came out of no where and just appeared, flashed once, zoomed across the sky, probably about 200-400 miles in less than one second.

Colorful lights flashing in Kent/Demoines;2014-10-25 21:00:00;2 seconds;Colorful lights flashing in Kent/Demoines Driving north on I-5 from Federal Way. The night is very windy with low clouds, but no fog. As I reach Kent/Des Moines I see a sudden flash of white, pale blue, then pink. The flash was a small section in the sky only on my left side lasting about two seconds.  About 5 seconds later the same three colors flash again at the same duration as the first. As I reach Tukwila (mall) a larger section of the sky on my right side flashes only blue lasting 1 second. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
