not remembering past getting out of the car.;1969-06-15 17:00:00;?;not remembering past getting out of the car. We were coming home from swimming  My dad saw it first turned into a driveway and stopped. We got out of the car it was a clear day not a cloud in the sky. The ship was huge about 1000 ft long about 350 high about 3000 ft. off the ground .  It was the color of a gray cloud didn't make a sound  I don't remember anything after that.  And it was a long time before I remembered that much.  I was 15 at the time.  My father mother and sister remember but one brother does not remember it.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Noon 7/31/00 a 3 1/2 foot long torpedo or football shaped object flying horizontally at a high speed by freeway underpass. Blue color.;2000-07-31 12:05:00;UP TO 1 SECOND;Noon 7/31/00 a 3 1/2 foot long torpedo or football shaped object flying horizontally at a high speed by freeway underpass. Blue color. Just past noon on July 31, 00 I saw an object that was shaped like a short torpedo or football shaped object flying South horizontally at a very high rate of speed. I was travelling east on South 260th which connects Highway 99 with Military Road South. I viewed this blue object as I came around the swerve in the road and looking straight at the Interstate 5 overpass. At first I thought this might be a remote airplane or toy of some type but dismissed it immediately due to the surrounding area being hilly. with tree's and brush. I knew almost immediately that I was witnessing something very special. This object if a toy would have to be self navigatable. It was about 3 1/2 feet long and the width was about 1 1/2 feet. I do not know how high the Interrstate 5 overpass is but I  think about 45-50 feet high. This object  was just below the concrete overpass.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Seattle - Blue-Gren object in NNW Horizon.;2000-10-24 06:45:00;2 - 2 seconds;Seattle - Blue-Gren object in NNW Horizon. On my way to work this morning I saw something just above the north/ northwest horizon. It was about 6:40 - 6:45 am. I was on highway 167(in Kent, Wa.)  heading north. As far as How far away did it seem? I would have to say anywhere from downtown Seattle to as far as possibly Bellingham. The description I would give this object I saw was as follows: It lasted for approx. 2 - 3 seconds. The trail behind it was blue to blue-green in color. The width of the trail I would say from that distance was as wide as your thumb. (not your normal meteor streaking accross the sky);47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
I was dropping my wife at work (Boeing Kent Space Center) made left turn to her building.  She said to look ahead.  At about 20 degrees;2002-12-11 06:15:00;5 mins.;I was dropping my wife at work (Boeing Kent Space Center) made left turn to her building.  She said to look ahead.  At about 20 degrees up we saw 2 very bright whitelights alernating from one side to the other at set intervals every 2-3 seconds.  Sat and watched a few minutes.  Lights did not move. I told my wife I would drive east out the main gatw then north on Interuban.  When I turned north the lights were gone but I saw a faint flat straight sterak going east  My wife went outside after daylight there was nothing in that area which would hold lights like these;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
fast moving objects making different triangles;2010-04-14 20:55:00;3 minutes;fast moving objects making different triangles When i was driving on the highway I5 and was getting close to the exit 149 i saw three very bright and big stars that were moving around the sky. Those stars were making different shapes of triangle. In a second triangle was acute then it became obtuse, in other second stars were going toward each other and then they were doing the opposite (going from one another). Those stars were moving very fast, one second they were on the east side of the sky while at the other second they were on the north side of the sky.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Sharp metallic craft seen from hwy167 near kent wa broad daylight!!;2012-06-06 16:43:00;5 mins;sharp metallic craft seen from hwy167 near kent wa broad daylight!! North bound on hwy 167 between Kent & Auburn, on the west side of hwy I noticed a very distinct metallic and sharp edged craft triangular on one end and squared with vertical and horizontal fins, center section looked hollow or very reflective, it did not move in any direction and appeared to be 2 or 3 hundred feet from the ground level, my co worker was with me, he asked what I was looking at then he started to gather the details as described,I even reduced my speed as he tried to get his phone ready to take a picture and then it was just gone,  I have seen many supposed UFO pictures, small aircraft, and even hobby aircraft.   This was something completely different, enough in act that I am writing this!  I am not a conspiracy driven or wishful person this was real and if anyone else saw this please post your sighting.

Cluster of multiple moving objects seen in western Washington moving from east to west.;2020-07-25 22:15:00;5 minutes;Cluster of multiple moving objects seen in western Washington moving from east to west. My neighbor and I witnessed what appeared to be a cluster of star like moving objects in the southern sky moving from east to west at a slow pace.  They did not appear to have any organized shape or formation and the objects slowly changed in orientation over the few minutes we watched them.  They eventually appeared to slow and disappear from view behind the neighbor’s roof-line and I believe they may have started moving south out of view from there. I checked out photos of the Starlink satellites and what we watched were definitely not those satellites.  What we saw had no definite pattern or orientation and were scattered in a changing cluster of lights.  The objects formed somewhat of a “J” shape from north to south and under the largest formation was a trailing cluster from east to west.  There were in the same area of the sky as Jupiter moving towards the west.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
