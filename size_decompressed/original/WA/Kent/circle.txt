Circular, bright metallic object hovering, seemingly dissapearing and reapearing in the same place high in the sky in South King County;1997-12-09 08:30:00;5 minutes;Summary : Circular, bright metallic object hovering, seemingly dissapearing and reapearing in the same place high in the sky in South King County, WA. I was travelling to work at 8:30am on Southbound I-5 on Tuesday, December 9th, 1997.  I first noticed this small, circular, metallic object (highly reflective) high in the sky approximately 11:00 position, 45 degrees from my vantage point.  It appeared to be probably over the city of Auburn.   I had just gotten on I-5 from the 405, Southcenter interchange, so I saw the object for about 5 minutes off and on.  It appeared to dissapear and then reappear in the same spot at least three times.  If this was a trick of my eye I cannot say.  The sun would hit it at times and the whole thing would appear to light up brighter than you would expect from a conventional plane.  (I am sending a .jpg image I created as an example..File 12997.jpg) By the time I neared Fife, I lost sight of it.  I am a computer graphic designer with an interest in UFOs, but have never seen anything like this in the skies before.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
Between 9 pm and 10 pm an amber colored circle passed over my house;1999-12-02 21:00:00;10 seconds;Between 9 pm and 10 pm an amber colored circle passed over my house While sitting im my living room at about 9 pm I saw a cricle that had a faint amber glow pass across the sky. At first I thought is was an airplane since I don't live that far from Sea-Tac airport, but when I noticed it had no beacon lights of any kind it caught my attention. It was not very bright, in fact it was so dim I was amazed i even noticed it. It was at an angle of about 50 - 60 degrees off the horizon, heading in a southern direction, moving about the speed of a small airplane. It was maybe about the size of my thumb at arms legnth. It was a fairly clear night, not a lot of wind, no meteors. I heard no sound (even though I was inside, an airplane that close would make a noticeable sound). I dont know of any aricraft that are circular, so I'm stumped.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

Cicle object over Washington state all different colors along the bottom;2005-06-15 02:30:00;Early morning;Cicle object over Washington state all different colors along the bottom The objects come out of no where when I was looking up at the sky past mignight in the summer months of last year. It moved at incredible speeds to fast it left a trail. I could hardley see it moving. It made sharp turns like they were making patterns in the sky. There was colored lights along the bottom of the craft. The colored circleted all along the bottom of it. The colors were green, orange, yellow, pink, and more colors I cant reall remember it was last year. I could feel a stange presence about it well maybe because it was a UFO. I went to sleep right afterwards and the next morning something felt different. I had very scary dream that night of aliens I know it sounds crazy. I don't know what else to do.

Orange orbs in sky.;2017-10-21 23:00:00;7 minutes;Orange orbs in sky Saw two very bright orange round orbs flying from west to east in the northern sky.  They traveled in an ark in tandem perpendicular to each other gaining altitude, then both vanished.  The sky was clear and I could also see stars, but these were much larger.   A third orange large orb appeared from the same direction after the first two vanished.  It seemed a bit larger.  It to moved in a high arc from west to east continued in altitude, it seemed to pulsate a bit while the first two did not.  As it moved up in altitude it got smaller, but just as bright, then vanished.  No noise, no aircraft was seen, no wind.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

Well then I realized that one of the stars was moving then shoot up till it disappeared. Then noticed another so the same. Then notice one over the house, not right over up in the sky but oddly moved and the up till it faded. Then noticed about 5 in a row coming from the East then all did the same.

All of a sudden at around 9:50 PM PST, I saw a little white circle travelling between 60 and 120 mph up off in the left part of the sky, my left. It went down in a diagonal, the direction of the letter N, and disappeared. It was not a plane or a reflection. It was too big to be a star, and the edges of it were too well defined, very circular. Bright white like the moon, kind of. It could have been a drone, but why was it going so fast? I was able to estimate the speed of the light because I drove under highway 18 a minute later. The bright circular object was going at least as fast as those cars, maybe up to twice as fast.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
