It was behind a stand of trees that had been planted for wind block. We left our friends house off 188th/116th in Renton at 1:00 Am.  I Checked the time before we left.  As we were traveling along 148th (Lake Youngs Road) southwards  we had just gone past 224th,   It was a cold clear night, moonless, I was leaning my head against the door glass watching the stars when I saw the object.  At first I thought it was a reflection on the glass because the image was faint.  I had my husband turn off the interrior lights and it was still there.  I couldn't hear anything so I had him turn off the radio. I rolled down the window.   It wasn't making any sound at all.  It was staying with us as we drove along.  My husband never saw it because of it's angle to the roof of the car.  I wouldn't have seen it myself if I hadn't been leaning against the window looking straight up.  When we came the stop sign where 148th crosses 240th street I watched the object go on over the hill.  In 1974 there were no houses up there.  I heaved a sigh of reliefe because this really spooked me.  Then as we were coming up on the stop sign at 256th a light caught my attention.  It was the object again.  This time coming at us head on about 30 feef off the ground.  We were stopped at the stop sign at this point and I paniced because at the nose of the object was what appeared a wide wind screen, with phosphorus green light emitting with the shape of a  humanoid in the middle.  I screamed at my husband to get us out of there.  He took off with tires screaming,  I lost my memory of the trip home from this point.  The next thing I remember is coming up on the stop sign at highway 18 on Wax Road.  I am completely calm, not worried or anxious.  We arrived home about 5 minutes later.  I took our baby son into his room and put him to bed and then took myself to our room.  The clock on the side of the bed said 3:18 A.M.  This trip we took from our friends home would take 20 minutes any day of the week, day or night.  We had lost 2 hours.  But I managed to convince myself that I must have read the clock wrong before! we left Renton.  I didn't know anything about UFO's or their characteristics at the time and it was easy to write off as just a strange incident in our lives.  After I filed my previous report (9/6/97 incident) I was just browsing your sight.  I read the report of the UFO Flap of 73, the Coyne Hellicopter Incident on 10/18 73 and  just freaked when I read the discription of the object.  It sounds so much like the object I saw on that cold January night.  I asked in my last report for someone to call me.  Now I really need to talk to someone.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
I saw two craft in the sky headed northwest, on a precise landing path for Boeing Field in Seattle.  They reappeared ten minutes later ;2000-02-02 20:00:00;20 seconds;((NUFORC Note:  We believe the aircraft were military C-17 transports, flying in formation.  We have confirmation from an FAA duty officer, who also witnessed the a/c over Kent.  They flew over Ballard, Queen Ann Hill, Sand Point, and many other areas.)) I saw two craft in the sky headed northwest, on a precise landing path for Boeing Field in Seattle.  They reappeared ten minutes later going the exact opposite direction. I was sitting in my bedroom watching television, when I noticed some lights going through the sky.  My bedroom window faces south, so I get a good view of planes landing at Boeing Field, and lights moving outside don't usually get me thinking.  This time, it was different.  The lights were moving too slow and their altitude was too low for them to be on a landing path.  At first glance, I thought they looked like Boeing 777s.  But at a closer look, things didn't seem to add up.  There were two craft, both moving at 200-250 mph.  Their altitude was approximately 2000 feet and they were lined up precisely one behind the other and about 1000 feet distance.  Their running and strobe lights were all green, which I know does not comply with FAA regulations.  They were noisy, just like any commercial jet aircraft. Their course never deviated at all, until they were out of sight.  What puzzled me the most is that they came back in the exact same formation ten minutes later, moving at the same speed, altitude, and direction as before, until they disappeared into the southeastern sky.  My home is located in the Panther Lake area of East Hill in Kent, Washington.  I don't know if this has any relation to my sighting, but earlier in the day I saw four white helicopters circling the area between here and highway 167, which is about two miles to the west.  These craft had no markings at all either.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

Both were angled at a 45deg.  They were either glowing or white in color.   At first sight I thought it was 2 airplanes turning above lake washington.  But as they stayed at that angle and continued north-west, I began to believe they were not airplanes.  They were traveling pretty fast.  I am 100% sure these were not airplanes.  I really hope someone else has witnessed these.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

I walked outside through the sliding glass door into my backyard.  I looked up into the sky and I saw an orange colored, with a little bit of red, cigarette shaped object, traveling mostly west to east.   It was not traveling as fast as a meteorite nor did it look like one.  I have seen many meteorites in my life.  The object made no sound.  It traveled behind a tree and I lost sight of it.  It was difficult to judge the distance of the object but it was about the length of the moon but only about one fifth the height of it.  The night is clear with no visible clouds.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554

Silently gliding through the sky heading from East in a North/west direction.  Was heading opposite or against the direction of clouds (direction of the wind).  Was clear and sunny, 72 degrees with very few thin wispy clouds.  UFO was was not near the few clouds but against the clear blue sky.    Watched until it went behind a tall tree line did not see it come out of the other side.;47.3773849765258;-122.21161314554
