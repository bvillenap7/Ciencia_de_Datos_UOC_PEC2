Dozen Orange Orb Lights in Central Washington State;2013-09-27 20:00:00;10 minutes;Dozen Orange Orb Lights in Central Washington State I saw 12 orange orb lights to the west. I would have to say they were north of Royal City(located in Central Washington State). I went outside a saw these bright orange lights in lines going up into the sky.  11 of the light went out for a minute came back on.  About 2 minutes later they started blinking out 1 by 1.  The last light stayed for about a minute after the others went out then started blinking and went out.;46.9166;-119.5847
