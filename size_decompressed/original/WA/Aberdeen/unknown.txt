Green blinking light on a zig zagging UFO;2020-07-04 00:55:00;7 seconds;Green blinking light on a zig zagging UFO I was looking at the moon at 00:55 when I had gone into the bathroom.  I saw a green blinking light in the sky, I thought it was a satellite.  The light turned solid white and the UFO zigged in the opposite direction it came from (south).  Then it zagged back in itâ€™s original direction (North).  It zigged and zagged one more time before the light started blinking green again and heading west.;46.9843;-123.7963
