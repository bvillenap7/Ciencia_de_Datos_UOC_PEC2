Dark colored semi-disked shaped craft flew over Aberdeen Wa.;2003-10-15 20:30:00;15 sec;Dark colored semi-disked shaped craft flew over Aberdeen Wa. On 10/15/03 at 20:30 hours my wife and I were gathering firewood along the banks of the Chehalis river, in Aberdeen Wa. While loading my truck with wood I remembered hearing a report about the northern lights and that they were suppose to be bright this evening. So I looked up at the sky and I directly saw not the northern lights but this craft flying slowly above me. It was saucer or disk shape with the sides cut off blunt, if I hadn't looked right at it I wouldn't have seen it. It was dark in color almost like an eclipsed moon in color but darker. It was about 500 Ft. above me and moving very slowly from east to west, and down river towards the bay. I yelled at my wife to look, look and I pointed at what I saw and asked if she could see it. But she couldn't it was to dark in color and it was night and the craft made no sound. It was something you would have to look directly at to see. The craft was small about the size of a small bus. It took about 10-15! sec to pass over head and continued on its path west until I couldn't see it any longer which was't very long. Considering the fact it was so hard to see and made no sound and moved so slowly I felt as if I was being spied upon or being observed, and I wasn't suppose to see it.  But I did, and what ever or who's ever craft it is, made in America or Alien they are out there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));46.9843;-123.7963
