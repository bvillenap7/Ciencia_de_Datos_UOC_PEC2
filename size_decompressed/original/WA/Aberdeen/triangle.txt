I'm posting to support the article:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32139.html.   I live in Aberdeen.  As the cited article said, this thing was no helicopter.  It was at least four times the size of a B-2 and from what I recall it was triangular in shape, black(possibly), and had seven lights.  My father and I saw it as it traveled over our house (and shook it quite violently).  It had a very low-pitched roar, rather dissimalar than a helicopter's - it was more like the noise you would hear from a quake, and for its size it was moving at an alarmingly low velocity and altitude. I have no idea what this was, but I can vouch for its existence. From my father's friend (an onlooker which saw the vessel from the south side of the Chehalis River) we were told it's size was similar to a small city's. Of course the local paper the daily world called it a helicopter.;46.9843;-123.7963
