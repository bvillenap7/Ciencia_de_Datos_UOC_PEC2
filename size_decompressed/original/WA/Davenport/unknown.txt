My sister, mother, and I were sitting in my living room when my mother pointed out  something in the sky.  My mother is not a firm believer in UFOS, but we gathered around the bay window. The object was massive, about as big as a full moon.  The object was a deep red, about as red as Santaâ€™s suit.  The object didn't seem to be moving, just sitting in one place. The UFO seemed to sit for about three minutes until it began moving.  It seemed to be moving downwards, only a few feet until it disappeared.  It didn't go behind any structure, it seemed like it just went invisible, disappearing out from the sky. We went and got into our vehicle to go look for this light, but we didn't find anything. That's when my father said that we should contact and document our sighting. My sister did get a picture.  The picture wasn't the best quality, but to me, it seemed like there were more UFOs than originally seen.;47.681;-118.1666
Bright red lighted object over Davenport, WA;2016-12-29 21:30:00;3 minutes;Bright Red Lighted Object over Davenport, WA At approximately 21:30 on 12/29/2016, I was sitting in my living room watching a movie on my laptop.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a bright red light in the sky out my living room window.  At first I thought it was a firework, but the light stayed constant and there was no sound, such as a whistle or boom.  There were no lights on in my living room at the time of this sighting.  My living room window faces East. I quickly got up from my seated position and alerted my daughters to the bright light in the sky.  One of my daughters had her cell phone handy and I asked her to take a quick picture.  She did take the picture, however, the she had the flash on and the quality of the picture is not the best.  The picture does not accurately reflect the bright red of this unknown thing in the sky. Upon inspection of the picture that my daughter took, I believe there were at least 3 unknown objects in the sky. I continued to watch this bright red thing in the sky until is just disappeared.  It did not appear to have any upward or downward motion, it just disappeared. Honestly, as a skeptic, this has me a little rattled.;47.681;-118.1666
