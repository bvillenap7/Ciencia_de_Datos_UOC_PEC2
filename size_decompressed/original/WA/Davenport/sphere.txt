Spherical object following power lines and sounded like a hot air balloon.;1999-06-10 03:00:00;5 minutes;Spherical object following power lines and sounded like a hot air balloon. I was at the bottom of Mill Canyon and I saw what looked like a head light of a train.  I honestly thought it was a helicopter but when it got closer it made noise that sounded more like a hot air balloon.  It was following power lines moving from East to West.  It was spherical in shape with ventercated sides.  It didn't seem to have thrust.It was more like the light it was emitting was pulling it along its course.
