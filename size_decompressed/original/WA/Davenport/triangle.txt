Three dim red lights in a triangle formation moving fast.;2013-01-03 21:12:00;seconds;Three dim red lights in a triangle formation moving fast The date was January 3, 2013.  The time was about 12 minutes after 9 o’clock. We were sitting in the hot tub.  The sky was very clear and cold with lots of stars in the night sky. Three dim red lights passed over us in an almost due north direction.  They did NOT flash like an aircraft’s lights do.  At first we thought we were seeing a shooting star, but there were three lights. There was absolutely NO sound associated with these lights.  They were much dimmer than civil aviation lights. The three lights stayed in the same “formation” the entire time we saw them. The lights moved very fast much quicker than an airplane unless said plane was very close to the ground.  If it had been a commercial jet sized plane, it must have been much closer to the ground than the normal flights that pass over this area because the lights were at least twice as wide as a commercial jetliner’s lights appear.  Perhaps it might have been a military aircraft that we were not supposed to see. But it made NO sound. One of the other things that struck me as odd was that the lights, while in a triangular formation, did not look right for a plane to me.  Normally a plane has lights at the end of its wingtips, and another at the tail, and maybe one under its belly or nose.  Such lights clearly delineate the outer edges of the plane. These lights passed over in a skewed triangle.  They did not appear to line up with the direction of travel.  If it was a plane, it appeared to be flying sort of sideways. I listened for a sonic boom, because they appeared to be going very fast, even for a low level plane but they made no sound. I’ve seen a lot of things in the skies before, but nothing ever looked like this. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report is well known to our Center, and we consider him to be highly reliable.
