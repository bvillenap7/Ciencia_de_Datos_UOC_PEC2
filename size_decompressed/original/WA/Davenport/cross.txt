Multiple glowing orange cross-shaped craft seen by 3 people in Davenport, WA;2011-08-01 03:00:00;5 MINUTES;Multiple glowing orange cross-shaped craft seen by 3 people in Davenport, Wa We were outside lying on my deck, watching a yearly meteor shower when multiple cross-shaped craft or objects appeared. They emitted an orange light and they zig-zagged around unlike anything I've ever seen. They moved around in an unusual pattern for a few minutes then took off at a speed our aircraft are incapable of.  A few nights later, my son and I were speaking of the incident with his girlfriend. When we looked up we saw the same orange craft in a different location of the sky. This time they were closer and there were fewer of them. I have no doubt these were not of this earth. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally well-spoken, and exceptionally objective in her description of the object witnessed.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.  She will attempt to have the other two witnesses submit reports, as well.  PD));47.681;-118.1666
