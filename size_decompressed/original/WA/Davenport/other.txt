Two steady parallel lights moving west spotted in Lincoln County, Washington.;2009-04-26 20:15:00;5 seconds;Two steady parallel lights moving west spotted in Lincoln County, Washington. While driving west on Highway 2 in Washington State last night, I saw two lights move parallel to each other across the horizon... looking up at a 45 degree angle.  This was just 10 miles west of the city of Davenport, Washington, in Lincoln County.  It was not similar to a shooting star, as there were two lights with a steady luminescence traveling together.  There was no fade in or fade out... the lights were at the same level of brightness at the beginning of the move as they were at the end.;47.681;-118.1666
Aircraft with 3 headlights, very slow, low, and quiet.;2012-03-23 22:30:00;2 min.;Aircraft with 3 headlights, very slow, low, and quiet. An aircraft with 3 closely spaced white headlights (plus other red navigational lights) was seen traveling about 25 mph and about 50 ft. off the ground.  My daughter and I watched the aircraft travel through our property for several minutes.  The only sound it made was a quiet humming.  It ran roughly parallel to Hwy 2, about Â¼ mile from the hwy.  It made a few slight course changes.  I got the impression the craft had some sort of dome on it like an E-2, or had rotors, but there was no sound or feeling of rotor wash.  It was the size of a small aircraft. I spent 5 years in the Navy, and worked as an engineer in the semiconductor industry.  I am now a home schooling mom.  My 12 year old daughter also saw the craft.;47.681;-118.1666
Extremely bright object slowly moving in and out of the mid-level clouds;2020-10-09 07:15:00;15 minutes;Extremely bright object slowly moving in and out of the mid-level clouds I was traveling east on Highway 2 from Davenport, WA. towards Airway Heights, WA. The sky was partly cloudy.  To the east at cloud level - maybe three to four thousand feet - was a very bright shiny object moving very slowly to the west. From my perspective it was shaped like a woman in a dress and without legs or arms.  I have never seen any craft that was that bright and shiny.  It did not look like a light, rather a very bright shiny object or better I describe it as extremely bright and shiny.  Due to its height I could not discern size.  It had absolutely no contrail behind or below it.  Its movement was steady and not like a weather balloon.  As the object traveled in and out of the clouds it did not have a change in brightness, telling me that its brightness was not due to the sun's reflection on it.  Because I was traveling on the highway I lost sight of it as it continued west and I to the east.  At the same time, far off to the southeast, towards the hills way south of Spokane I could see a very large bright yellow-orange ring suspended above the hills.  From the distance it was, and in comparison to the mountains it eventually and slowly disappeared behind, I would guess that the bright ring was several miles in circumference.;47.681;-118.1666
