I pulled our car over on School Street and i told  my wife i want to check something out as this craft was moving slow and only about a estimated 1/8 of a mile away from us as the Mtns are close to Our Home in this small town. I rolled window down and shut car off to listen closely for a Engine of a small airplane but there was no noise being emitted from the craft as it slowy turned to the North East and no flashing Nav/ Beacon lights as is required for A/C flying at Night. we watched it and the light just quit completely without any trace!??

Erratic White Light;2008-06-13 02:00:00;10 minutes;Erratic White Light I was outside in the yard at around 2 in the morning, and was looking at the sky to determine the weather for the day, when I noticed a bright white light on the South Eastern sky, it started moving so at first I thought it was a plane but there were no blinking lights just a bright white ligt, it then started moving towards the south east and was going very erraticly making sharp 90 degree turns that no plane, jet or helicopter could have done and the bright light would dim and brighten again, which was strange in itself because there was no cloud cover.   Really bothered me and did not know what to do.   Also it would be stationary for 20 to 30 seconds and I continued to watch it for about 5 to 10 minutes.   After concluding that it was not a regular aircraft I logged onto the internet and wrote this.;47.5458;-120.5961
