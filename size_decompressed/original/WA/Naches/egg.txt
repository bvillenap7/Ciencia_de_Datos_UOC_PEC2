Large oval craft seen breaking through clouds.;2013-08-09 10:30:00;2 minutes;Large oval craft seen breaking through clouds A very large ship resembling a narrow egg to nearly oval shape about the size in length as a destroyer class and about as wide as  the smaller air craft carriers seen docked at Bremerton Naval ship yards.  The main hull was near rounded on the underside with a “horse shoe” or “tongs” shape resembling a cloud like paint job which never changed in shape but low glow (could have been the sunlight).  The rest of the hull was blue like the sky and had it not moved would never have been seen. Near perfect stealth, zero noise/sound.  Craft had no wings nor tail, that was observable. Travel was with purpose and not erratic, seeming to glide or slip through the air.  Travel was SSE to WNW from near Naches, WA, toward Mt. Rainier.  Speed was fast, observed from the ground like jet fighters about the same elevation as observed around JBLM. Monday the 12th passed same site and stopped.  Did see a small airplane about same elevation.  could be heard and very tiny and had a lite rocking pattern.  Very unlike the graceful “slide” of a much larger craft.   No photo’s or vid. sorry,  Too caught up in observing it and having trouble processing what was seen until after the event was over.;46.8058;-120.9921
