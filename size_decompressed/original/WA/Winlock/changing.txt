The colors changed from yellow to red, green and blue alot of red this is not the first time. Last nightthere was 2 and then a green streek of light. Acouple of months ago in the same place is when we first noticed them. Since the first time we see them more often. My Husband is a truck driver and I some times go with him I have watched them from the truck usually there in the west going south on I-5. From our Front porch witch faces the west we have watched them move and change colors. They have been here for the past two nights. Tonight there was 4 of us who watched them till they moved away. Acouple of months ago was the first time we saw them there was 2 of us that saw 2 of them and they interlinked with each other and moved apart changed colors and would interlink again this happened acouple of times till one of them took off. The one that was left would move alittle bit and change colors and repeat.;46.493;-122.9199
