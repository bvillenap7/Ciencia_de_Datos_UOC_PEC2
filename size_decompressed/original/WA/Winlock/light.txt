Riding the train between Seattle and Portland,somewhere near Winlock, observed a very bright oval light probably 3-5 miles away. Moved faster than any plane,it made erratic right angle turns, first going west and then east, straight up, then it disappeared.  The sky was clear and the sun was shining. The size was hard to determine at that distance, but may have been the size of a car or larger, oval or round.;46.493;-122.9199
saw strange like fly toward us and then shoot srtaigh up furhter into the sky,this is 5th time seeing this light.;2009-06-05 23:50:00;5 min;saw strange like fly toward us and then shoot srtaigh up furhter into the sky,this is 5th time seeing this light. My girlfriend and I witnessed a strange light slowly flying over our heads. We have witnessed this light four times together and once I witnessed it myself. The light usually flys in a straight line and then vanishes in mid flight. Thelast night I witnessed it I actaully saw it change direction and fly straigh up futher into the sky as a plain approached it. We did happen to get video of it on our camera on one of the nights. The lights did not flash nor did it have any flashing lights with it, it also made no sound what so ever and from the looks of it the light flew lower than most of the planes that fly overhead.;46.493;-122.9199
