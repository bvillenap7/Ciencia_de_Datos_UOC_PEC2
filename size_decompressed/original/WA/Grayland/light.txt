Red/Orange light over the Grayland/South Beach area of Grays Harbor County, Washington.;2016-05-11 22:00:00;10 minutes;Red/Orange light over the Grayland/South Beach area of Grays Harbor County, Washington. Approximately 10:00 pm in Grayland, WA.   Traveling south from Westport along the coastline, I saw a bright Reddish/Orange light in the sky approximately 100 to 150 feet above my vehicle.  It was moving at about the same speed that I was traveling and in the same direction.  It moved west toward the beach from Highway 101 and back toward me several times as I made my way South  for nearly 3 miles.  I and the vehicle behind me pulled to the side of the highway at our first opportunity.  The “Light” stopped for a brief moment (approximately 2 to 3 minutes) and stayed at the same altitude and distance from my location.  It then slowly began to move south again gradually gaining speed.  I followed it until it seemed to decrease in size until it disappeared and was gone.  There were 5 of us that seen it.;46.8276;-124.0888
