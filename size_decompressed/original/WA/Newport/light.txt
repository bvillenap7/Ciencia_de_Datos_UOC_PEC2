Horizontal white light moving at amazing speed.;2012-06-14 22:30:00;5 seconds;Horizontal white light moving at amazing speed. About 10:30 pm on june 14th 2012 a bright white light shot horizontally across near Diamond Lake Wa accross the sky in what looked like a south direction.  We have witnessed satellites and planes and shooting stars frequently but this was some kind of flying craft and it was going faster than anything I have ever seen. It was unexplainable and going perfectly horizontal. This light had no explanation whatsoever and I and my witness have never seen anything like this before.;48.1701;-117.1449
