Silver Spherical Probe entering and exiting chemtrail in Othello, Washington;2007-03-18 12:00:00;1 minute;Silver Spherical Probe entering and exiting chemtrail in Othello, Washington There were chemtrail activities in the air around Othello, WA all afternoon.  Othello has many agricultural farmland.  There were many planes in this area dispensing something in the form of chem trails.  One such chem trail cloud was very thick and long.  There was a small, silver, spherical looking probe that continously entered and exited the formation.  After about 30 seconds, it went in the cloud again and never came back out.  It was silver, reflecting sunlight, and was about the size of a car tire.  It resembled sputnik, minus the spikelike antenna.  I believe it was monitoring the contents of the chemtrail in the air for extended periods of time throughout the day.;46.8496772727273;-118.997031818182
