6-round white/silver object.s...3 in a triangle formation west/east direction;2006-08-19 16:00:00;15min;6-round white/silver object.s...3 in a triangle formation west/east direction on aug 19 about 1600k.a group.of friends and family where enjoying the warm summer day when my son(age 23) (noticed a small round object very high in the clear blue sky.he asked what is that we all looked up searching the sky. it took a moment to focus on the object..the object was round..whitish in colour..and moving west to east slower than jet. yet looked higher in altitude ,most of us carried on with conversation when one of us noticed that there was three more round objects following the first object..what really got everybody talking was that they where flying in a triangle formation..we all asked does anybody have binoculars or a camera..one per son was sent to my cabin..to get my binoculars (7x35)..using  the glasses you could see the objects where white--to a light silver hue. with transluscent blues and reds on the west trailing edges of all four  objects..after watching them for approx.10 min. we moved from the front yard onto the street..at this point we where joined by others who where walking..driving along the road..we pointed out to them what we where, observing. all young and old where amazed and startled..excited to what they where witnessing...as the 1st object was disappearing on the very high horizon (45deg)from 1200 high..it was observed that there was two more of the same white-objects following just off track of the 1st and 2nd (triangle formation)..the three objects that where flying in this formation..held the same formation the whole time that they where visible..this group disappeared on the same angle on the horizon as the 1st object...the other remaining 2 object followed and disappeared as well....at this writing which is one week to the day of this unusual sighting...i have thought about when you watch jets that are flying at a very high altitude (30,000 ft.) you can hardly see the aircraft mostly the jet stream trail..they also disappear lower on the horizon..with this deduction, in my opinion these round white object where larger than a large jet and fl! ying at a higher altitude.;48.9843;-123.0581
