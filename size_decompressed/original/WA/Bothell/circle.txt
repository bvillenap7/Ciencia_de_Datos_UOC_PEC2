It had one brighter light and two other lights that were dimmer, surrounded by a glow.  It was in the same light as the bright light, just dimmer...  in conjunction with a full moon, it was round... but half sized.  It moved in a direction from right to left... upwards.... stopped... them moved downwards... right to left... then straight across (left), from right to left, then upwards.. (in conjuncion with the moon), an inch (?)  then downwards.. and then darted behind the trees... and then I could see it no more...

It came out of nowhere.. the way it moved.. the way it looked... It didn't look like ANYTHING I had ever seen before.. no airplane.. no helicopter..

The hellicopter was very very close to the star like object.  They were going hellicopter speed (slow) and the hellicopter was staying right on its tail (weird close like when the blue angles fly close together).  They were going north to south.  It was not another helicopter or plane just a star looking object being escorted or chased.  The helliopter had all its lights on.   I have only heard a hellecopter  that loud once before during the day and they were huge hellicopters.   We don't usully get helicopter flying around here very often never at night.   My neighbor heard it to from her bedroom and thought it was weird.   It was a little overcast full moon but a bright sky.  Kinda light outside.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Bright orange lit object with a red halo slowly flew over Bothell, WA.;2012-02-21 20:00:00;5 minutes;Bright orange lit object with a red halo slowly flew over Bothell, WA. I was walking outside late tonight and I noticed bright orange light with a red halo slowly moving across the sky fling easterly. as I watched the object, the orange and red lights did not blink and I could not see other colors I would expect to see on an airplane or helicopter.  I heard no sound as I would expect from a larger plane. After a couple of minutes, the lights slowly dimmed and disappeared  However, I could see a dark silhouette of an object in the sky...;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Orange Orbs over Bothell - up close and explained;2012-07-04 22:00:00;30 minutes;Orange Orbs over Bothell - up close and explained It has become expected that on the 4th of July we look upwards to view the infamous orange orbs. We saw more this evening around 10pm than any other year: probably about 6, each in it's own position. (Not in a group.)  All sightings moved exactly the same, however.  Silently and in the same direction (from the NW to the SE).  Each had the same speed: guessing about 10 mph?  All were also at the same altitude.  Each also just suddenly disappeared while watching. As noted, we have been mesmerized by this unique sighting for years and have posted UFO reports. Each year, however, we have only witnessed one over Bothell.  This year was exciting as we saw many. As always, we see these on the 4th of July. I can share we had a revelation this year as we experienced this orb up close and our understanding of what we have witnessed was changed.  A new firework was avaialble for purchase at our local shop called the Chinese Lantern.  We set 3 of these off ourselves: one red, one orange, and one pink.  Each had a fire actually in flame which raised this 2 ft long x 1 ft long paper lantern directly up. It moved SE as the wind came from the NW.  It floated quickly up and the higher it got the faster it moved. It was silent, of course.  It glowed orange from within.  Explaining that beautiful lit from within result we've witnessed over the years.  It glided steadily as we watched and the suddenly just went out.  It I took pictures of it with my 12x zoom level and compared it to the pictures of the orange orbs that moved over head.  They looked exactly the same. (I will include them with this report.)  All sightings moved SE with the wind direction, and all were at the same altitude ! and speed. This reports our personal sightings here in Bothell which always occur on the 4th of July.  We believe our sightings have been the Chinese Lanterns.  However, it is not intended to explain that is what all orb sightings are.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
