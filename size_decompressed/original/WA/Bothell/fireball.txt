It started about in the southeast sky at a downward angle and traveled west before it disappeared. My wife went out to walk the dog at 8:50 PM on Wednesday, September 23, 1998 in Bothell, WA. Right around 9:10 PM we were walking in a SE direction when I noticed a bright light in the sky but partially obscured by a tree. The light appeared to be about the size and brightness of (Jupiter?), the bright planet currently visible in the southward sky, but pale green in color. I soon noticed the light moving toward Seattle (west) and at a downward angle. I told my wife to look. We both witnessed it as it streaked into full view for about three more seconds. The light appeard to get bigger and brighter as it moved and had a small orange-red tail. The largest the light ever got was about the size of an eraser held at arms length. It seemed to disappear or burn out about 30 degrees in the horizon. My wife's first thought was that it was a firework because of its color and brightness. I believed it was too far and too low in the horizon plus moved too far and fast to a Roman Candle. It basically looked like a very bright shooting star - but green.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Yellow/Orange Lights;2010-07-04 23:00:00;30 sec;Yellow/Orange Lights On 4th of July at about 10:45-11:00pm I witnesses two orange/yellow fireballs traveling W/NW.  I was visiting my cousins and we were outside shooting fireworks until about 11:30.  These particular lights caught my eye because they seemed to be much higher and traveling much faster (and more deliberately) than anything else in the sky.  I thought they were flares with the usual red color distorted by smoke traveling horizontally dues to a light wind we had.  After reading some of the other area sighting, however, I am having second thoughts. The lights resembled the video of the Phoenix lights I have seen in luminosity and color.  The traveled though the air, one following the next, at the same velocity and same altitude.  I only saw them briefly and didn’t think much of it at the time and went back to blowing stuff up.  We shot off and watched a lot of fireworks that night but these lights definitely caught my eye due to how unusual and out of place they were. Later that night on our way back home to Bellingham I saw a single light, just like the two I saw about an hour earlier in Bothell , in the Marysville area while driving on I-5.  Identical in every way except that it was alone and appeared to be stationary.  I, again, wrote it off as a flare, even commenting to my wife how thick the firework smoke must be to distort the color so much. With the other reports I’m starting to think what I saw may have been something else since it resembles what other witnesses report seeing around the same time frame in the same vicinity.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Bright slow light in the sky moving from NW to SW like a satellite but very much brighter July 7th 2010.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.  PD));2010-07-07 22:47:00;2 minutes;Bright slow light in the sky moving from NW to SW like a satellite but very much brighter July 7th 2010 My 14 year old son and I were outside cleaning up @ 10:47 PM.  When we saw a bright light moving slowly across the sky from NW to SE.  The bright light did not have any blinking navigation lights so I knew it was not an airplane. There were airplanes in the area though and they all had blinking nav. Lights on.  This bright light was going about the same speed as a satellite maybe a little bit faster but much slower than a meteor.   It flew across the entire sky and then was gone.  The light just vanished. This was a very intense light like something from spot light from far away.  I wonder if it was the international space station.  I don’t know. I have never seen this before. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.

Four red/orange orbs traveling horizontally in a perfect line, in perfect distance from each other;2012-07-04 23:13:00;6 minutes;Four red/orange orbs traveling horizontally in a perfect line, in perfect distance from each other I saw 4 orange/red fireballs traveling horizontally across the Western sky from the North to the South. I ran to get my binoculars, because they were traveling silently, in a perfect line, keeping perfect distance with each other, and traveling at the exact same speed.  They looked so bright, and had a bit of a disc shape surrounding the bright orange/red center. With my binaculars, they looked like comets, with space dust or something burning around them, and a bit of a short tail. I watched them for a couple minutes, then realized I should document them, and ran to get my video camera. In a panic to capture the 4th one that was passing by, almost out of sight, (too many trees here in Washington state), I took a very distorted video. My video looks like a blob, and not what I witnessed of the perfect formation, speed and travel of the objects through my binnaculars.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
