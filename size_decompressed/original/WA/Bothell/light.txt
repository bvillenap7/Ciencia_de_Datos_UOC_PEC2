I was looking towards the SE. There was no sound. Several small airplanes also crossed over head that night, and those were quite loud. No light reflected on the low cloud cover, as did the many airplanes I saw that night, indicating it was very low in the sky. One could clearly see the airplanes white, red and blue flashing lights in distinct formation. What I saw actually became obscurred behind the trees in my yard at one point. It appeard to be only about 1 mile away, traveling over Bothell Way! The above description captures most of the information. I wish I had been more conscient of looking at relative surrounds to get a better idea of the objects size. I would say it was close to half the size of a lightbulb at 10 ft from the observer. I was very keen to observe the airplanes that night, to base my observations a the conditions and weather circumstances that night. It proved to me that it was definitely NOT an airplane, It was also not weather related. I do not believe it was an asteroid of some sort. There was no tail that I could see.I have lived in my house, where I observed this, for over 7 years. Occasionally airplanes on the horizon fool me into thinking they are not airplanes, when they come straight towards me, and their WHITE light seems unusually bright, and they dont appear to move. However, eventually they change course and I can see their distinctive colored lights and patters. In fact what I saw entered my vision from my left and crossed to my right. It never came straight at me. It's light was consistent in radiance.My background: I am a 32 year old female, and a graphic designer and artist. I will send you an illustration of what I saw. I may even be able to send you an actual animation, for that is also something I do for a living! I consider myself extremely open-minded to things of this nature, but to this point in my life I have never seen anything like what I saw June 6th! Unfortunately, I was alone and was the only one that saw this from my deck.Julie Brockmeyerjbrockme@adobe.comps, I did call this in Friday night about 9:50pm;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Object entered atmosphere from above, traveling east to west.;1998-09-23 21:10:00;3-5 seconds;Object entered atmosphere from above, traveling east to west. Object entered atmosphere from just east of top dead center, traveling east to west. Object appeared to have a direct trajectory of 20 degrees downward as it traveled.  Initially appeared to be a meteorite, but blossomed into fireball within a half second of being spotted.  Fireball developed, appeared to be white/greenish white.  Looked reminiscent of re-entry of manned space capsules seen in pictures.  Appeared to be eminating from center of object and fanning out to the rear.  Object moved relatively slow compared to the quick meteorites seen in shower months.  Object appeared to burn out, dimming in intensity and just before extinguishment appeared to have several apparent red embers floating behind it. From south of Bothell, elevated at approximately 75 ASL, it appeared as one looks directly south, the bearing was from 160 degrees on the compass going to approximately 250 degrees. There was an aircraft on final for SeaTac who would have had an excellent view of the object, appearing to be about even with the 520 bridge on their approach.  The light as it extinguished appeared to be at an altitude well above the airliner on approach.  No other aircraft were noted to be in the area at the time. The object, for reference, seemed at it's biggest, to be about 33% the size of a full moon as it is typically seen overhead. The observer is a former military electronics technician, with some aviation experience, and on track to earn his private pilot wings in second quarter '99.  The observer was standing outside with a clear view, on a clear night, with no obstructions impeding the event.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778

It was stationary and then in about 4-5 secs..shot off to the left and into the bright moon. Peter, after I told my sister, ((name deleted)), to send you her sighting, I thought I should send you mine, even though it isn't that interesting. The bright light was indeed close to Mars' brightness. I hadn't seen many objects move that fast before, but it did shoot off directly into the moon which was in the left of my viewing field. Mars was in my right viewing field (which was my bedroom window!) Hope all is well with you and thank you for your calls.  Hope to see you one of these days when our trials are over...â€¦((name deleted));47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Observed through binoculars a bright light moving from north to south at a high rate of speed.;1999-09-19 17:10:00;5 - 10 seconds;Observed through binoculars a bright light moving from north to south at a high rate of speed. I was laying in my hammock looking at the sky when I noticed several bright objects.  I retreived binoculars to observe what I believed to be helium balloon clusters that had been released.  While verifying that they were indeed balloons I noticed a fast moving light pass behind the balloons. I tracked the light with binoculars until I lost sight of it behind some tall trees. The light was 1/8 inch in diameter at arms length as seen through 8 X 23 power binoculars and appeared fuzzy, rather than a single spot of light.  Light tranversed 1/3 of the horizon in approximately 5 seconds in a north to south direction.  Seemed too fast for an artificial satellite.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
brilliant blue pulsating lights that were blinking in and out and swirling around one another ( Incredible );2001-06-02 00:00:00;6.5 minutes;brilliant blue pulsating lights that were blinking in and out and swirling around one another ( Incredible ) I was sitting down on my apartment's third floor balconey relaxing after getting home from work.   Looking up at the sky, like I always do when I sit on my porch.   I noticed two pulsating blue lights that seemed to be as big a dimes when I scaled them with my fingers. These objects seemed to me to be observing the surrounding area.  They were top shaped but I really could not make out thier shape. I'm a banker and strongly believe in the existence of UFO's.  I do know the difference of conventional aircraft and satalites.  I'd say these objects were about a 1/2 mile up in the air.  They were motionless in the sky except for the one which was cruising around the stationary one.  I called out to my roomate and told her  to come see what I was looking at, but she wasn't available.  I kept watching them and they started blinking in and out, that's when they started flashing and blinking to different points in the sky further and further away from eachother.   Really amazing and kind of beautiful at the same time.  Finally they left the view of the horizon and left to go god knows where.  Incredible, incredible experience.

Odd Light not assiated with the Meteor shower;2002-08-13 03:20:00;2 mins;Odd Light not assiated with the Meteor shower I was outside looking at the meteor shower. I saw a light about the size of Mars in the E/SE.  I thought it was a planet. Perhaps Mars. I saw it Move VERY slowly. That caught my attention. At arms length, it moved 4 inches. Tnis light was in the complete wrong direction of the meteor shower, which was coming more from a N/ NE direction.This was coming fromE/SE going to N/NW. After obeserving this very slow move for about ten seconds, it disappered! About 20 seconds later, it 'flashed' on again, continuing in the same path it did. Then it went off, or at least was not visable any more. Most unusual. Right after that, I saw a bunch of the meteors coming from an entirely different direction. I feel that the light from this was not the I.S.S. It was too small. Not quite as large as Mars would be.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778

There is no set pattern, like a message would be on an airship. The lights seem to be different colors but that could just be the refraction of light.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Star-like object changing luminosity while meandering from SE to NW direction before vanishing;2005-09-05 22:15:00;4 minutes;Star-like object changing luminosity while meandering from SE to NW direction before vanishing I was in my backyard last night around 10:15pm looking up at a very clear and starry nighttime sky.  As I was scanning the sky a very bright star-like and star sized object caught my eye from the Southeast.  When I turned to look at it I initially thought it was Venus or some other very high altitude plane. However, the light was very bright and after watching it for only a few seconds, its luminosity changed and went back to just an ordinary star brightness. I noticed that it was also moving in the Northwest direction so I continued to monitor its path.  As I watched it move to the NW it looked like one of the numerous satellites I see all the time so I was about to turn away and find something else to look at it when I began noticing that this light was not moving in a straight line.  It was meandering right and left in a slow s-styled motion.  From my ground vantage point it looked like it was maneuvering through an obstacle course.  The speed of the object remained constant and it was still heading in the overall NW direction but it would jog right and left about 8-10 degrees every 15 seconds or so.  I have never seen a satellite or plane change directions before like this at such a high altitude.  The change in direction seemed purposeful.   I had been watching this first object for about 3-4 minutes when I noticed a faster moving companion object 10 degrees below it and gaining on the first.  Both objects were coming out of the Southeast and headed to the Northwest.  This second star-like object had the normal star luminosity and was travelling 3-4 times as fast as the first object. This second object was not moving in any sort of irregular pattern.  It seemed like it was traveling on a very straight line.  I could see both objects in my field of view and as I watching both, the first object flared up again.  Extreme luminosity.  It was intensely bright. The luminosity coincided with second object  below overtaking the first object above. This time the intense brightness lasted only a second before returning back to normal star-like brightness. Then a couple of seconds later the first object went dark. It completely vanished. I could still see the second object continuing to the NW but my first object just turned off or disappeared.  About a minute later the second object left my field of vision and I could no longer track it. ((NUFORC Note:  Description seems consistent with the flare from an Iridium satellite, but neither Iridium satellites, nor the ISS, was visible from Bothell on the date, and at the time, indicated by the witness.

Fast bright light making s shaped turns back and forth;2008-07-08 23:59:00;5 seconds;Fast bright light making s shaped turns back and forth I don't know if anyone else saw this. I saw what i thought was a falling star appearing from behind the tree line. it was travelling north. the light did not fade and i thought it may be a low flying satelite due to the speed. it abruptly turn west then back east then west again and then north bound again. the shape of the turn was a large S shape. the speed was much faster than commercial craft and the light was bright, like a bright star. i was stunned when the object deviated from the straight course. as soon as it made the first turn i thought something was strange, i had never seen something move like that before. there was no noise but i would guess the object was at about the same height that a commercial jet flys.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
2 very bright star-like lights traveling close together at same speed, dimmed and disappeared.;2009-06-09 23:59:00;under 1 minute;2 very bright star-like lights traveling close together at same speed, dimmed and disappeared. Four of us were sitting at a park on Lake Washington at midnight on 6/9/09.  Three of us saw what looked to be 2 really really bright stars about three- fingers width apart. They were still for about 10 seconds and then slowly moved up past a stationary star and dimmed out and disappeared.  At the same time, one of the four of us was looking in a different direction than we were and saw 3 bright stars in the formation of a triangle.  After approximately 10 seconds they all dispersed at the same time, 2 went up together and the other 1 went down.  They all dimmed at the same time and then disappeared.  The 2 that three of us saw were in the West and the 3 the other one saw was in the Southwest.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Bright glowing ball of light in the sky, shot down by plane, retreated and darkened very quickly;2009-07-22 22:05:00;3 minutes;Bright glowing ball of light in the sky, shot down by plane, retreated and darkened very quickly me and my friend were standing outside as he was about to leave when we saw a light that looked star-ish but was brighter than any light i had ever seen in the sky, and it seemed to be changing colors in a rainbow-ish pattern. It was floating in the sky near a tree in the distance, hanging in the air but slowly drifting left. As it passed behind the tree and reached the other side, another small craft that looked like a fighter plane flew by and shot out a small white object. This object seemed to hit the glowing light and at once the light started dimming. It then rapidly moved to the right in a slightly zig-zag pattern, flew upwards, at this point almost dark, and dissapered. About 30 seconds later we could hear many many sirens in the distance.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Gathering of a dozen or more orange lights in the northeastern sky -  a gathering;2010-08-29 21:00:00;20 minutes;Gathering of a dozen or more orange lights in the northeastern sky -  a gathering In the northeastern sky, a very bright orange light was observed, not moving and stationary against the background sky.  Thinking this was just an aircraft moving in my line of sight (stationary), I opened the blinds to get a better look, only to discover three more bright orange lights below this object, moving towards it.  No sounds of aircraft was present.  The lights joined up, formed a semi-circle, then the end light faded away leaving the remaining three lights to form a triangle (picture available), only to fade away as if moving into a fog.  From the East, more orange lights continued to appear sometimes two or three at a time moving through the tree line, joining up with the other objects, pausing, then fading away.  At any given moment, there was a dozen lights in the sky.  It was as if this was a gathering.  This gathering lasted 20 minutes.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Father and son witness acrobatic orange orb over Bothell, WA.;2015-01-15 06:30:00;10 minutes;Father and son witness acrobatic orange orb over Bothell, WA. I stepped out on my back deck in which I have a full view of the Cascade Mountain range.  A stationary orange light above the cloud line caught my attention.  It started to move slowly and I just figured it was an airplane coming towards me at a strange angle.  Then it instantly shifted direction and stopped.  Then went in another direction and kept moving slowly.  I called my son from the front room and said, You gotta see this thing.  We both watched it and tried to figure out what it could be.  It then started moving slowly horizontally for some distance and stopped again.  Then made a vertical descent almost to the ground.   This is when I could estimate how close it was as it was in front of the hill in my sight line.  I'd say about a mile.  Then it was just gone.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
