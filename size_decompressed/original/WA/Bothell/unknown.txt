Saw a light moving very low and made a ninety degree turn at full speed.;1973-11-24 19:25:00;2 minutes;Saw a light moving very low and made a ninety degree turn at full speed. My sister and I went out on my back deck and were looking West when we saw a bright dot going South to North that I took to be a landing light.  We continued to look for a short time because of the extreme speed of the object.  The light made a 90 degree turn and climbed out of sight in about one second.  The light passed between existing lights in the fore round and back round.  Unless I had been looking at just the right spot I would not have seen it.  At the time I was active Air Force reserve and the Civil Air Patrol so I have been trained to observe and report.  This is the only time I observed anything near this. I saw something I can not explain and get quite angry when some quack starts telling fairy tails on TV, and makes everyone look like idiots.  If you dug a tunnel a thousand miles long, where did our government put the dirt?  We have a 15 or 20 miles and that dirt covers about 100 acres about 200 feet deep.  The 5% lunatic fringe is alive and talking. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
flshing lights, darting around very quickly.;2001-10-19 22:00:00;3 min.;flshing lights, darting around very quickly. I noticed out my window bright blinking lights in the sky East. There were several (5-6) lights at least one red and the others white as if on a plane. The lights were blinking very rapidly and the object was moving up down, side to side and back and forth. I thought it's strange movement must be caused by going in and out of clouds, but I realized there were stars all around so there were no dense clouds. The object moved in this manner along the south sky from east to west, then I watched it go over the house from the west north. It moved along straight like a normal aircraft as it went from the west, northward at which point I lost sight of it. Although I could not say the shape of this object, the lights flashed in a sequence or formation that gave the appearance of a diamond shape.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778

Wobbly white light north of Seattle, WA.;2013-06-06 00:00:00;2 minutes;Wobbly white light north of Seattle WA I had stepped outside for a moment and instinctively looked up at the stars.  It was warm night and mostly clear.  I saw what appeared to be a satellite, and watched it as  it moved in a path towards the north east. It as a white weak light, only slightly brighter as a star, and moving faster than I would expect a satellite to move. There were no blinking lights visible so I ruled it out as plane.  A satellite also seeded unlikely as I am close to a major metropolitan area with some light pollution present. What caught my attention that made this object unusual to me was that as it moved across the sky it appeared to have a slight wobble in its flight path.  I wasn't sure if what I was seeing was correct, so I tracked it's movement relative to several other stationary stars and it did indeed seem to have a wobble. I eventually lost sight of the object after it passed over some trees in my neighbor's yard.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Object(s) in night sky Bothell, WA, Nov 20, 8:45PM.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is severely flawed.  PD));2014-09-20 22:45:00;~3 seconds;Object(s) in night sky Bothell, WA, Nov 20, 8:45PM. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that report is a hoax.  Date is flawed, and source has failed to respond to our e-mailed messages.  We have changed the date.  PD)) At about 22:45 in Bothell, WA, I was on my back deck and saw numerous objects (I believe 6) fly overhead.  They had no lights but were clearly visible I'm assuming due to the city lights below.  They looked silverish-gray but that is probably the city light reflecting off them.  They were in a V formation.  One in front, two directly behind the first, and 3 behind the two.  The row with three, the one on the far right was off centered however.  Appeared to be pulling away from the others but I can't be sure as I only saw the objects for a few seconds before they went over the tree line.  There was no sound at all.  I cannot give an exact altitude but I'm guessing 1000-2000 feet due to the speed across the sky.  Basically west to East.  If they were at 10,000 feet they would have been the size of jumbo jets and going at least mach 4 or 5 so my assumption is much lower altitude.  Again, no sound at all which is not possible if it was a low-flying (or high flying) formation of jets. I cannot guarantee they were separate objects as it's a pitch black night sky, but it appeared they were, as one was out of formation.  My first thought was maybe a big drone but the speed was too fast and the off-centeredness does not make sense. I'm sure others saw what I saw too as it's a populated area.  Very strange and never seen anything like it.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
((HOAX))  Heard strange sound that couldve been someone.;2017-09-04 00:30:00;5 minutes;Heard strange sound that couldve been someone Me and my brother were smoking weed at around 10:30pm to 12:30am.  We were talking but he heard a Graaaauuuuuchhh: sound repeatedly.  We both heard it over and over again.  Then it went quiet and we went inside.  Strangely enough when we went out again my brother said he heard the same sound on the other side of the street and that it seemed close.  If some guy was just making noises its possible but he would need to be in a weird mood to do so.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778

Shiny object moving quickly across the sky N-S Mill Creek / N Bothell WA;2021-07-24 16:55:00;20 sec;Shiny object moving quickly across the sky N-S Mill Creek / N Bothell WA North Bothell, WA... Between 4:50-4:55 PM my wife and I were sitting on our front porch which faces East.  I know this to be the exact time because we called my sister and cell phone shows called made at 4:52. As we talked on speaker phone, my eye caught something moving north-to-south (from Mill Creek to Bothell) straight across the sky. It was hard to determine elevation and size but likely at a thousand feet or so and small, round shape (?). It was shiny and appeared reflective so hard to determine the exact shape. I saw it first and asked. what's that? My wife looks up and immediately says, a bird. I continued looking to make sure it wasn't a sea gull or white bird flapping wings, and beyond a doubt it was not a bird. I said, no way that is a bird. That looks really strange. She could tell it wasn't a bird either and then replied, a mylar balloon. Ok, now a balloon caught in a wind current is a possibility and fits som! e of the description. I am rational and reasonable and this could explain it. However, something just seemed off about that explanation.  I tried to get my brain to see it as a mylar balloon but the size, speed and way it moved could not reconcile. I would not waste my time reporting this if I was confident it was just a balloon or a drone. We continued to watch it as continued out of view... no other changes as it went out of sight. Am curious if anyone saw and reported this same object?;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
