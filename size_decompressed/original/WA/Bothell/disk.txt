Also, it had a flashing white light on top and bottom. It flew over my house.  Then it proceeded to fly straight, and gradually swerved off to the right, heading east.  I looked at it through binoculars and would have taken a picture, if I had a camera.  Two of the observers are 13 yr. olds, two others  (myself included)  are 14, and there was one 45 yr. old.  The UFO was illuminated in what seemed to be a white light.  It had two flashing white lights: one on top, the other on bottom.  It had a faint red light in the side, also flashing.  The UFO looked like two discs stacked on top of each other, and it was in the shape of the saucer from the enterprise on Star Trek.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778

I originally took a picture of a plane leaving a smoke trail behind it and then of a cloud (one of two clouds in the sky) .  About 15 minutes later I saw two fast moving white objects but I wasn't quick enough with the camera. I waited another 10 minutes and saw another object and took the pictures.  The object seemed realy small as it was a pretty high altitude;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778

I was driving home from work at about 10:15 pm. Upon turning from an intersection onto a straight away that led to my house, I saw a bright light up in the sky. I was confused as to what it was so I kept my eyes on it. As I was driving towards it, I realized that it was also coming towards me at a very slight slant. It started out as high as a plane might be, but I noticed it was coming closer than I first thought. I kept driving and the light was dimming slowly to where I could see that it had two blinking lights. One red light at the front and one green light on the back so I thought that it was just a plane. Problem was that it was too low, much smaller than an average plane and it wasn't making noise. When our paths met, it was a few hundred feet above my car and the bright light was gone making the shape of it evident: a disk. It hovered over, past my car and that's when I pulled over to freak out and try to process what I just saw. I stared at the road in front of me for a second then turned my head to follow where it was going. I made a quick u-turn and pulled over on the other side of the street to watch it glide over the neighborhoods and that's when I decided to follow it, but it went over an area of trees with no road. After about five minutes of driving towards it, it was no longer in sight and I decided I needed to go back home to do some research on UFOs.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
