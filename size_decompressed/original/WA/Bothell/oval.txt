About 15 jets over area, but only 2 or 3 at a time. First spotted a thin (flat) horizontal cloud that began to tilt and descend. Then a larger thicker (taller) horizontal cloud also tilted to the left but the leading portion no longer looked like a cloud but cylindrical and dark (not sunlit by the rising sun). Two small clouds came out of a separate larger cloud. Binoculars showed them to be oval in shape with distinct edges - NOT clouds. The second cylindrical one now down past mountains. Another oval one came out of the same cloud the earlier ones had. All objects SLOWLY descending past Cascades. Jets flew in from the South, about 1 or 2 at a time. Jets in the area past 9:30. All objects were lit by the sun as clouds are.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778

It just sort of hung in one position much to long for a helicopter and it was not an airplane.  it seemed to be very low in the sky.  I was wondering if the blump was out lastnight?;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Unidentifiable Aircraft over Bothell, WA  - 20 giant type drones;2019-01-21 20:30:00;15 minutes;Unidentifiable Aircraft over Bothell, WA  - 20 giant type drones Last night, my daughter, my grandson, and I witnessed many type of aircraft.  They were like giant drones, with lights all around.  The way they were flying it was not a plane.  Two of them were very close to land and stationary.  It was very scary and they were many of them over the intersection of Maltby Road SE and 35th Ave SE.  Also in the intersection of Everett Hwy and Maltby Road SE.   I called 911 but they send me to report this to the FAA.  I could not find anyone to answer the phone.  These type of aircraft is totally unidentifiable and looks that is not from here.  The scary part of it is that they were many of them. Why is our government doing something about it?  This is not a joke and many of us citizens have seeing these aircraft many times. My daughter was one time followed by one of them and she just drove as fast as she could.  This happened around midnight in 35th Ave SE, Bothellâ€¦;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
