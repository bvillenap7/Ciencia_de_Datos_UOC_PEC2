Pulsating bright green lights seen NorthWest of Bothell area. Number of lights would change from 1 to sometimes 4 or 5.;1999-09-09 22:00:00;20 minutes;Pulsating bright green lights seen NorthWest of Bothell area. Number of lights would change from 1 to sometimes 4 or 5. At approx. 10pm on 9-9-99 my neighbor asked me to come outside to see what she and her husband were watching.  At first there was nothing there. Then, 2 or 3 bright (almost florescent) green lights would pulsate in the sky.  They never appeared to move from the spot where they were,  however the number of lights would change.  Sometimes there would be only 1 and sometimes 3, 4 or 5.  Then the lights would disapear altogether for a few seconds (15-20) and re-appear again. The neighbors had been watching this for about 10 min. before calling me outside.  About 5 min. after that another neighbor came home and also witnessed the lights in the sky.  This was a total of 4 people observing the lights.  At 2 instances, there appeared to be a beam from the light to the ground (or vice-versa).  The lights were quite high in the sky eventhough they were quite large.  At times they appeared to be behind a portion of cloud as the view was hazey and dull, and then other times appeared bright and clear, as if it were in front of the cloud.  There was absolutely no sound.  The night was quiet and any sound would have been heard.  We get quite a few commercial aircraft in the area, so am familiar with their lights and sound.  Also get copters from Whidbey Island Base and are familiar with their sound.  We are wondering if anyone else happened to see what we saw that night?  Any suggestions as to what it was?  Have never seen anything like it before.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Unusual air traffic;2000-08-25 21:00:00;30 minutes;Unusual air traffic The other night a friend of mine and I were leaving the Bothell YMCA around 2100 hours and looked over in the sky because we noticed an unusually bright light.  It looked like a regular airplane, then we noticed 2 more.  They didn't appear to be moving for a minute, but then they started moving and seemed to be circling an area.  It could have been anything at all, nothing unusual, but we felt that there was a story behind it.  So we grabbed some taco bell and set out on the highway to find a way to get closer to what these planes were circling.  We belive we saw a military aircraft (but not positive) because it seemed to be still in mid-air, then just took off at great speed.  Not your regular passenger jet.  Anyways, we were going down the on-ramp to get onto 405 southbound from Bothell, and what do you know, there was a PACSAT van right there, with a satellite, stopped on the side of the road.  We passed by him, then he started up his van and came onto the highway as well.  I slowed down my car to let him pass me because we thought we would follow him for a while, which we did, and he was driving pretty quickly (over the speed limit), but he went too far South for us to venture out any further at that hour.  We headed back home.  We believe that something was going on somewhere near Woodinville/Kirkland/Redmond area.  We haven't seen anything in the news since!  The next evening near the same time, we noticed quite a bit of air traffic near the same area.  Slow moving planes that would suddenly increase in speed, but circle the area.  I wish that someone else would have seen too. ((NUFORC Note:  We received no other reports from this area of Seattle for this time and date.  The area is in the approach/departure area for Sea-Tac Airport, so it is not clear how military aircraft could be operating in this area when normal operations of commercial traffic are taking place.  We will attempt to inquire of the witness what a PACSAT van with a satellite is.  PD));47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Star disappeared while observing Perseid Meteor Shower.;2004-08-11 22:30:00;3 minutes;Star disappeared while observing Perseid Meteor Shower. While observing the Perseid Meteor Shower from my back deck, I focused on one particular patch of sky, which was facing west with a declination of about 80 degrees.  I was looking at a cluster of stars, when one simply disappeared.  It was a clear night, with no clouds, and there were no airplanes in the area at the time, and no flocks of birds.  I watched the area for three or four minutes, but the star never reappeared.  I have no explantion for what I observed.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Large flashing rainbow colored lights seen @630-7pm over I-405 N/S  in Bothell/Woodinville/Juanita.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));2016-02-10 19:30:00;All night till sun rise;Large flashing rainbow colored lights seen @630-7pm over I-405 N/S  in Bothell/Woodinville/Juanita WA State area. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is observing the very bright and vivid star, Sirius.  PD)) On tuesday 02/09/16 @ about 6:30/7pm In the Juanita Kirkland/Bothell/Totemlake/Woodinville/ right off the 160th st exit of I-405 N/S area of Washington state, I saw a light in the S-SE sky or so that was fading in and out in its brightness,  And flashing in a rainbow color pattern, and was also slightly moving possitons while still staying in one general area.  The flashing rainbow light just stayed in that same general area dimming and flashing rainbow and kind of bobbing around as far as I know all night.   Then On Wednesday 02/10/16 @ around the same time at night as on Tuesday (6:30pm-7pm) & In about the same location in the sky as it was on Tuesday night,  I again saw the same flashing Rainbow colored light.  At about an hour after first spotting the light again.  I noticed that afew small airplanes (2 to 3 of them & They looked smaller than a cessna and closer to military drone size, each with a bright white light at its center and a solid blue light on one wing! and a solid red light on the opposite wing.)   Where starting to fly around the location of the rainbow colored flashing (not positive but I think triangular shaped) light.  After about 30 mins of those small planes checking out the flashing raindow light 2 large (mostly blacked out) helicopters came flying over and started checking out the flashing light for a while as well.  Once the helicopters started to leave and the small planes started heading back, off to the SE-E direction I noticed another flashing rainbow light as well as a 3rd one farther off, and almost directly above my location I noticed a light like the flashing rainbow ones, except this one was instead brighteniging and dimming (in a flashing kind of sense) this deep, rich, radiant, bright, glowing Goldish/Yellow/Orange colored light(same triangular shaped craft as the flashing rainbow light  craft) instead of rainbow like the others. I watched these lights for about another hour and a half or so and then the ! clouds start to come out & block out the rainbow & Goldish flashing lights,  And right as that starts to happen I noticed the the sounds of planes AND helicopters in the area had increased as if a lot more of planes and helicopters where now in the area checking out these flashing rainbow lights & Goldish light and using the clouds as a cover for themselves to hide behind.  My mother was also watching and hearing all of this as she was standing next to me for a large portion of the time that this had all been taken place in, I had also used my phone to try to record some of what I was seeing, I also called my brother and had him step out side and whiteness the flashing  rainbow lights and Gold flashing light before the clouds covered them for the night.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
