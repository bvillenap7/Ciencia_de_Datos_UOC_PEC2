I believe it was big enough to cover an acre of land. It had one large middle light like a large bulb in the center and on the outer corners were two small lights. It hovered 45 minutes with no noise whatsoever. I stood outside and watched it for 45 minutes. The most amazing thing was the two lights on each point of this triangle then departed going opposite ways of each other and did some very strange things like loops and things and left the hovering thing there. These two little things that left the large thing were much smaller but they were like points of light. It then formed in a line and flew out towards the mountains but it was very unusual for something to hover for solong but the two points departing was really strange. I phoned this in at the center that night and no ! one has called me back. I can draw it and show you where it was. It was right over our pasture and not that high above ground. I thought at first sight it must be a plane going to land, but planes cannot hover for 45 minutes that I know of and things cannot just depart and :do their own little air show. I have not forgotten this and may never forget it.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778

Lights like blue, red, yellow, green, all flashing at random times. the craft was moving at a good consistant speed. Then at of know where it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  We presume the witness means a nighttime sighting.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Several similar reports for the evening on this date.  We suspect the objects may be the three satellites that have been reported to NUFORC on many occasions, and which we believe are part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system.

2 triangle shape object fly slowly over Bothell;2001-09-23 17:30:00;30 min.;2 triangle shape object fly slowly over Bothell At first glance, I thought it would appear to be airplanes in formation, but at the second and third glance, they appeared to move as one.  The size of one of the ships would be relevent to the distance of your index finger and your middle finger spread out.  Though the sun was very bright, and we could only see the two objects in the shade, they seemed to be very high up in the atmosphere.  But what puzzles me, is that the objects nevertheless took an half an hour to leave sight, but they didn't leave any after burn trail at all like our aircrafts do.  On the two objects the lights seem to be a very bright color, not determined because of the brightness of the day, but they seemed to be a bright white, all six in unison.  That is all I saw, then went back to work. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar report from co-worker in Bothell, WA, who saw the same formation.  Hot air balloons fly in the valley to the east of Bothell, typically during the late afternoon, when winds are relatively calm, but we have no idea whether that might have been the cause of the sighting.

2objects with 3 lights in triangle shape moving very slowly at a high altitutde.;2001-09-23 17:30:00;30min;2objects with 3 lights in triangle shape moving very slowly at a high altitutde. Me and a coupple of my friends were at work, when one of us went out back to take care of the trash. Because we work in a shoping complex we have other stores to our right and left. When my coworker went out back a cavilian who was using the laundry mat next door and came out back to take a break. The cavilian noticed the formation and pointed them out to my coworker who promptly came to tell me and my other coworker. We all went out back to check this out because the sun is blocked by the buildings. We (12 of us because some more people came to see what the commotion was about) looked up and origonaly saw nothing untill we squinted and saw three lights in triangle formation. We then looked just barely south of it and saw three more lights in the same formation (a triangle formation). Both crafts were moving from South to North. It was hard to see because of the smog and dust from the local freeway, but no doubt this was the reall stuff. In all there was about 12 of us because more people came out to see what was going on. Hey, if you've seen something like this post a messege. This is cool and creapy at the same time. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the correct time of the sighting is 5:30 p.m..  Please see similar report from co-worker in Bothell, WA, who saw the same formation.  Hot air balloons fly in the valley to the east of Bothell, typically during the late afternoon, when winds are relatively calm, but we have no idea whether that might have been the cause of the sighting.

Not balloons;2001-09-23 17:30:00;10 minutes;Not balloons I was reading your report of 12 people working at a Bothell supermarket who saw 3 triangle shaped objects. Your explanation of these objects was that they were balloons. I live in Woodinville (a mere 3 miles away from Bothell) and balloons go over my house about every other day. These balloons frequently fly above my house at a very low altitude (somewhere in the margin of 250 feet) and there is usually 1 at a time in the sky, and they never fly in the full darkness, so i find it hard to belive that those objects could be the balloons. Thanks.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
Upside down triangle, solid, dark color, one object, no lights, traveling at a steady pace and movement.;2004-02-14 00:00:00;~15 seconds;Upside down triangle, solid, dark color, one object, no lights, traveling at a steady pace and movement. Looked like an upside down triangle with soft corners.  Solid, dark color.  It was flying horizantally, in a south to north direction on the horizon.  No lights, did not alter in direction or speed.  There was a plane in the sky going in the opposite direction, also ducks flying low near our pond.  These gave good perspective to the object's size and movement.  It was overcast but not rain.  No sounds heard.;47.8046030303031;-122.204977777778
