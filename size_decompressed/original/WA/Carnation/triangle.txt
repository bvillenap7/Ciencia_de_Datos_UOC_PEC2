While laying in bed a light caught my eye in our skylight.  I alerted my spouse to lookup...  The triangular craft went over the house, traveling S.W., low & silent.  The craft lights were 2 large orange circular lights (each out at wing span) & 1 flashing red light at nose position.   here were no Green or White light at all.  I watched the craft continue to fly low into horizon. My spouse, is extremely knowledgeable in all plane identity's new and old.  My spouse has eagle eye vision and has never seen anything like it before. We often sit in our hot tub on our 2 acres, we have lived at for 27 years, in the rural country & know what planes passing over look like, this was not normal.;47.6377;-121.9124
