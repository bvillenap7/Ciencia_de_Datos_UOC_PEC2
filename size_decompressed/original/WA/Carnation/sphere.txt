Bright Green Object in Sky Over Puget Sound area;2007-03-16 22:30:00;5 sec;Bright Green Object in Sky Over Puget Sound area My first report ever.... At approx 22:30 3/16/07, looking to the west/northwest I observed a bright glowing green sphere with what appeared to be a lighter green aura in the sky approx 20 degrees angle off the ground. The object from the moment I noticed it appeared to go straight down at a very high rate of speed in a small zig-zag fashion like a lightning bolt. No noise was heard from the object. The rate of decent observed could NOT have been from free fall, it moved far too fast. My first thought when I saw it was that it might be a flare or a firework but without a smoke or exhaust trail just a trail of light that faded rapidly and the rate of speed at which the object descended made me believe that the object was powered somehow. I have been trained to identify objects both in the sky and on the water. This was like nothing I have ever seen before and I hope I get a second chance.;47.6377;-121.9124
