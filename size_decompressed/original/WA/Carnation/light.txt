I'm not exactly sure of the year, maybe 1979 or 1980, and I remember my grandfather and I were standing at an upstairs window before going to bed - I believe we were facing East.  We were looking out over a dark field. The Tolt River ran on the West side of the house and was behind us.   It was a clear night beacause the stars were shining.  All of a sudden multiple bright lights appeared in the sky and moved very fast back and forth across the sky.  They were lit spheres that seemed to dart a long distance across the sky  in less than a second!  The lit objects moved horizontally and vertically at a very fast speed.  I remember watching this occurrence for about 5 minutes until the objects zoomed upwards and outwards at an extreme rate of speed into the night sky and out of sight. We went to bed that night completely amazed and unsure what we had witnessed. I have never formally reported what I witnessed that night and my ! grandfather passed away in 1991.
