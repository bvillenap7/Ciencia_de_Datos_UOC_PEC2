Very impressive sight. the observer of these objects is very familiar with all natural phoenomenon such as sattelites,space junk re entry,meteors etc and has been viewing for  decades the skys. your guess is as good as mine,what the nature and origin of these craft are. the craft were very bright white and appeared about the size of venus would to the naked eye.the distance and altitude were not possible to calculate from the viewers position.
