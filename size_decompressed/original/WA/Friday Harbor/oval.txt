I was stanting out in the field outside of my house when I felt a buzzing sensation in my skull. I looked up and there wasa strange object that descended from the clouds. It was oval shaped and it had a strange yellow luminescence coming off of it. It seemed to have dropped a glowing white object into a nearby field, and Immediatley took off. After it was gone, the buzzing ceased. I went to try and find the glowing object in the nearby field and I only found a dent in the ground. The Dent was not a hole. The ground and the grass appeared to be perfectley intact, except that it was a concave dent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact data.  No photographic evidence of the alleged dent in the ground is offered.  We would like to communicate with the party who submitted the report.  PD));48.5445;-123.0954
