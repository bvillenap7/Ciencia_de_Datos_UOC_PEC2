Slowly moving black or silver flat, doughnut, saucer-shaped disk seen by 3 observers on San Juan Island;2002-09-08 11:00:00;7 minutes;Slowly moving black or silver flat, doughnut, saucer-shaped disk seen by 3 observers on San Juan Island I observed a flat, doughnut, saucer-shaped disk high up in the sky as we waited in line to board the Washington State Ferry from San Juan Island at approximately 11:00 a.m. on Sunday, 9/8/02.  There were three of us who observed the object. The object was black or silver.  At first we thought it was a kite or a balloon because it seemed to move only slowly.  The object seemed to wobble aerodynamically as the air went through it -- almost as if it was designed to move that way. It traveled in a straight line along the horizon above the trees.  We boarded the ferry and went upstairs to a window right away to continue watching the object.  At the speed it was moving, it should have still been there, however, it wasn't.  The day was clear, not cloudy or rainy.  There were no lights or sounds associated with the object.   We could not observe any windows or doors -- seemed liked one solid piece.;48.5445;-123.0954
