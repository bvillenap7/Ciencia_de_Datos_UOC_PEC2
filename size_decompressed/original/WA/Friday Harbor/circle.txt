I saw a round object that appeared to be falling from the sky, but the rate of speed appeared to be under control. The object was a dull white in color. As the object fell, it disappeared behind a cloud, and did not reappear below the cloud, as it should have done, if it was in a free fall.  The object was not an aircraft, but something round and under intelligent control. I've held a commercial pilot's license for 36 years, & I say it was not of this world.  Another encounter of mine: In August 4-6, 1991, I was standing in the snow at the 7000' level of Mt Hood. I saw a round shinny object moving slowly at 090 degrees, at 12,500', then the object came to a stop directly over Mt Hood. The oject glowed, then moved 8 miles south (160 degrees)& stopped, then moved 16 miles north (360 degrees)and stopped, then it moved directly back over Mt. Hood again, then sped out of sight (2 seconds) heading 090 degrees again. All this took place in a matter of seconds. I reported this to the park ranger, who said she gets UFO reports daily!?! So she was not concerned. The object was identical to the objects that was seen flying or hovering over Mexico City in 1990 or 91.
