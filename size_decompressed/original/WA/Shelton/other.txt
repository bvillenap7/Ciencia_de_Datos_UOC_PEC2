Upside-down rocket glides past Shelton WA.  UDA.;2014-07-28 08:15:00;~1 minute;Upside-down &quotrocket&quot glides past Shelton WA. UDA At approx. 8:15am PDT, I was sitting on the front porch having a smoke, and I looked toward the Olympic mountain chain to the west.  I quickly spotted a slow-moving object, colored dark grey, and shaped like an old V2 rocket but upside-down.  That is, the pointed nose was facing down and the tail fins were pointed skyward.   The object slowly moved from my left to my right (NW or NNW).  Distance appeared to be at least five miles and the object's airspeed appeared to be 150 to 200mph.   When I first saw it, its azimuth was approx. 9Â°, and it appeared to slowly descend as my view of it became obstructed by a small stand of trees approx. 200' away it never reappeared on the other side of the trees (probably because its rate of descent would have placed it near ground level and I do not have an unobstructed view of the ground from where I was positioned). No lights or exhaust plume were visible, and no sounds were audible (even taking into account the many seconds of delay there would have been between the object's first appearance and its subsequent disappearance).;47.2123;-123.0971
