My husband and I watched lights in the sky for about 45 minutes.;2002-08-04 23:25:00;approx. 45 min.;My husband and I watched lights in the sky for about 45 minutes. My husband and I were locking things up for the night when I noticed a strange light in the sky. I asked my husband to look at it to see what he thought and he wasn't sure, niether of us could see it very clearly so my huband came in the house and went back out with a pair of binoculars. When he came back and we had looked at it we decided we had to get actual video or photographic evidence. My husband came back into the house and took out the video camera. While I was watching the first one with the video camera my husband was looking around to see if he noticed anything else. He watched another came out over the tops of the trees and curve back in the shape of a U and dissapear back in the trees. We had watched the first one for about 45 minutes, never saw the second one again that night, and got 15-16 minutes of video footage. My husband went out about 3-4 more times that night to see if it was still there and it was other places in the sky but in the same general direction it had been in when we had first seen it. When I looked through the binoculars i saw tree lights on what appeared to be the bottom of it. The lights were arranged in a triangular shape, but I was unable to tell exactly what the shape of the object was. The color of the lights were red, green, and orange. They seemed to be strobing and rotating at the same time.;47.2123;-123.0971
Flashing white lights over Sanderson Field in Shelton Washington;2006-11-16 18:15:00;3 minutes;Flashing white lights over Sanderson Field in Shelton Washington I was driving with my son on our way home near Sanderson Field in Shelton, Washington when a flashing light out my window caught my eye.  As I looked closer, I noticed that there were many flashing white objects perhaps 8-12.  The Objects appeared to be the size of large stars and were flashing a white lights (much like christmas twinkle lights).  I pulled over to get a better look.  I could not determine a specific shape or formation to the lights, however, as the lights moved, the objects stayed in the same position relative to each other.  There is no way these were normal aircraft, they were too close to each other even though the pattern took up a large portion of the sky above the airport.  I went home to get my camera and head back to the airport.  As I approached the airport from the highway, a truck tore into the main entrance ahead of me at a high rate of speed and sped out to the tower.  When I parked at the airport, I could not find the object, and some low clouds or fog had set in and was covering much of the sky.  I could no longer see the object, and got no pictures.  I noted on normal aircraft apparently circling the airport, but that could possibly be a normal training flight.;47.2123;-123.0971
April 06, 2007 at 19:45 hours, metallic looking and brightly lit , motionless for 15 minutes duration.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2007-04-06 19:45:00;15 minutes;April 06, 2007 at 19:45 hours, metallic looking and brightly lit , motionless for 15 minutes duration. On Friday April 06, 2007 at 19:45 hours, I sighted a small, brightly lit object in the early evening sky.  The object appeared as a small, star like object near motionless in the western sky.  The object appears to be at approximately 60,000ft. Elevation, bearing 275 degrees from Shelton, Washington, in Mason County.  I estimate it to be approximately 20 miles distant from my location.  It did not appear to be a star but was metallic looking and brightly lit from beneath by the setting sun.  The object remained fairly stationary for well over 15 minutes.  It was the stationary nature of the object that caught our attention.  I used a pair of binoculars to look at the object and found it to be too distant to discern any additional detail.

Very fast horizontal, low-flying, silent light.;2015-12-13 23:00:00;3-5 seconds;Very fast horizontal, low-flying, silent light. I live 8 miles north of Shelton, Washington. Tonight, 12/13/2015, at 11:00 P.M., while standing on the front porch of our home.  I witnessed a very bright light in the sky.  It was going at a very high rate of speed, from the southeast to the northwest. It almost appeared to be like a headlight.  There was absolutely no sound.  It seemed to me to be traveling at about 500 to 700 feet above the ground. All I saw was the light.  It must have been going at least 500 m.p.h.  As far as it was above the ground it appeared to be half again the size of an automobile headlight. It seems silly to me, to report this, but I have never seen anything like this before. At first I thought maybe a star or meteorite, but it was absolutely horizontal. Just the one lone light.  No other lights like would be on a winged aircraft.  I said to myself  “what the hell was that?”  Maybe I’m losing it. I am a 68 year old married woman. My husband and I are both retired. I have completed some college.  I’m just an average person going by the rules living my life.  No history of mental illness or police record.  Just standing on my porch having a cigarette. Which by the way I do every night.  Again I have never seen anything like this before.;47.2123;-123.0971
