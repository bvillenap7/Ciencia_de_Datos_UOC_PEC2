We were walking near the WA Correction Center, facing about 70* E, with a full moon at mid-sky just to our right.  At the same level as the moon, from left to right a large fireball with a flaming tail went across the sky.  The flaming tail kept breaking apart.  The fireball and tail were bright orange with a bright yellow ring around the fireball.  We thought it might be a satellite breaking apart in the atmosphere.;47.2123;-123.0971

We were walking to a nearby park at around 1:00 a.m. when we saw a bright green fireball fly across the sky maybe 30 feet above the trees. When it flew across the sky it shot red triangle shaped things backwards at about 45 degrees of the direction it was fly. The triangles went about 5 feet from the flying object before vanishing. The triangles were shot off both sides of the flying object. It took the flying object about 5 seconds to fly out of sight. Both witnesses looked at each other in confusion and believed no one would take us seriously if we talked about it.;47.2123;-123.0971
