Bright Light;2003-07-25 22:41:00;2 minutes;Bright Light Sitting alone in the middle of Totten Inlet (S. Puget Sound)on my boat. I was star gazing. Saw one good Meteor and one Satellite. Night before, I was sitting with friends on the west shore of the inlet and we saw 12 satellites in about 90 minutes. Have seen many over the years, but the object I saw at 10:41 PM was much brighter than any satellite I have ever seen. It was brighter than any of the stars visible to me (perhaps 3X). It was traveling in a straight NE direction. There were a few high clouds, and the object (light) was higher than the clouds, but either it was the intensity of the light or it just wasn't as high as what I would expect a satellite to be which really makes me wonder what it was. I first saw the object about half way across the sky. It was ahead of me about, and 65 degrees above the NW horizon. What made this different than an ordinary satellite was its brightness and the speed of its traverse (faster 2X), but also that I was able to view as it went well towards the NE horizon (15 degrees) with little change in the intensity of the light. There might have been a slight tail to the object when I first spotted it, but it was passing behind the high clouds, but was still visible, hence that might have given me the impression it had a short tail. The event lasted long enough for me to look at my cell phone to check the time and ponder who I could call to see if they could see it. I would say close to 2 minutes ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Dear. Mr. Davenport,   RE: Shelton siting.   Thank you for your reply. After reviewing the ISS tracking plots I am left doubting that what I saw was the ISS. The reason for this is that the track of the object was towards the NE and not the SE as would be indicated by the web site you sent the link for. The other issue was the fact the object remained lighted (reflecting?) well towards the horizon to the NE. The ISS website indicates that the ISS would not be lighted as it passed that far to the NE at the time of night (infact it indicates that the ISS would not be lit as it passed over the coast line of N. America. Perhaps you might get another inquiry about this. Just wanted to let you know.   Regards, ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  We are still exploring the possibility that the sighting might have been caused by the ISS.  We are uncertain about the date of the sighting, and may have sent the wrong data to the witness.  The sighting may have been on July 24, and we have requested confirmation of that fact.

Bright orange object flying very rapidly to the southwest, no tail and too fast to be meteorite.;2004-08-08 23:30:00;5 seconds;Bright orange object flying very rapidly to the southwest, no tail and too fast to be meteorite. I went outside to look at the stars and after a little while a very bright and very fast light shot across the sky...faster then anything Ive seen, it was heading slightly southwest of our house, it didnt leave a trail like a meteorite would and it didnt fade out or dissapear...it just shot into and out of sight very rapidly without any stopping or direction change.;47.2123;-123.0971
Bright  light  being  followed  by  what  appeared  to  be  a  helicopter.;2006-03-14 20:25:00;1 minute;Bright  light  being  followed  by  what  appeared  to  be  a  helicopter. I had just left my house headed for the corner store driving north west on ellinor street.When from the west i saw a bright constant white light followed by what appeared to be a helicopter about 300 feet behind.At first i thought it may be a blimp.I pulled over and got out for a better look at this.I watched as it went over downtown shelton which lights up the sky bright at night due to the lumber mills located there.This is when i realized there was nothing between the light and the aircraft.At that point all that i could figure it was was a light being followed by a helicopter.Their altitude couldnt have been more than 800 to 1000 feet yet i heard nothing.Wondering if anyone else saw this?;47.2123;-123.0971
12 red lights over Shelton.;2007-04-05 23:00:00;a few seconds;12 red lights over Shelton. As I was driving home on John's Prairie rd. I saw a string of 12 or so red lights behind me in my rear view mirror.  Because I made that drive so often I knew the lights didn't belong.  I slowed way down and took a closer look in the mirror.  It seemed as if the lights were not high at all and looked slightly larger than a major star.  They also seemed to be only about 1000 yards away.  The thing that really freaked me out though was that when I looked behind me rather than in the mirror I didn't see anything and then after taking two looks behind me and not seeing it (yet still seeing it in the mirror) it disappeared from the mirror to.  The objects were to the west of me.;47.2123;-123.0971
Fast Moving Light;2009-05-23 21:50:00;2 miutes;Fast Moving Light Walked out on the deck overlooking Island lake at 21:50 to check new yard lights. Looked up and saw a VERY bright light moving faster than any airplane or satellite I have seen . Had time to get my Mom out to look at it before it disappeared to the east. It was the  size of a pea held at arms length. I looked at it through binoculars but could not discern any features.;47.2123;-123.0971
Two lights that looked like sattelites traveled in a line, with one following/chasing other until the both disappeared.;2014-04-18 22:00:00;15 seconds;Two lights that  looked like sattelites traveled in a line, with one following/chasing other until the both disappeared. Last evening on April 18th, 2014, my 25 year old son from Juneau, Alaska was visiting and we decided to go out in the hot tub and catch a viewing of the ISS at 21:36 Hrs local Pacific Time. The ISS came from the NW on a course towards the SW at about 86* above us.  At about a minute into it, I had looked away and my son, ((son's name deleted)), said he saw a light chasing it and it disappeared.  I never saw it and thought perhaps he was just seeing the reflection from the Space Station since this was his first time. At about 2200 Hrs, I was looking to the south at about 50* center in front of me facing the south and I had saw a satellite.  Make note:  Between 21:36 and 2200 Hrs. we had seen at least 10 plus satellites that seemed to be going north to South and South to North passing the Big Dipper.  Can’t remember a time when there were so many in the sky in a short time. This satellite I saw in the south was going from SNW to SSE and then I saw what appeared to be another satellite about 3 fingers right behind it.  However, these two were going a little bit faster than the normal satellites.   I got my son to look and he locked onto them an then it appeared these were lights and the #2 was following in pursuit of the other #1 light.  Just as the #2 increased speed and a little distance the #1 light increased speed and disappeared as the #2 light disappeared. I have seen lights do weird stuff, but to see these two lights in the sky that were not lanterns and looked like stars or satellites move through the sky like they did and vanish was an incredible rush to share with my son at my age of 51. Thank you for allowing me to share my observation.  Not sure what my son saw, but we both saw this!  I just wanted to post this report in case others saw this.;47.2123;-123.0971
Light that moved unlike a terrestrial aircraft.;2015-03-06 18:45:00;5 minutes;Light that moved unlike a terrestrial aircraft. At approx. 6:45pm PST on 03-06-15, I was on the front porch having a smoke with my mother.  I looked to the WSW and saw the planet Venus.  Then I looked to the north and saw a stationary white light at approx. 25° azimuth.  I continued to  watch the light, and noted that it was briefly eclipsed by a power line across the street.  At this point, I knew it  wasn't a star or a planet because it was moving in the wrong direction. As I continued to watch the light, it flew slowly SW.  I figured that it was just a high-altitude aircraft.  I looked over  at Venus again, looked at it for ~5 seconds, then turned my head north again -- and much to my astonishment, the light had  moved much, much more quickly (est. 85° azimuth now) than my 5-second glance at Venus would have allowed had the light  been a terrestrial aircraft. So I pointed it out to my mother, and she had observed the light making a zig-zag motion across a fair percentage of the  sky visible to us. Both of us continued to watch the light as it flew overhead and disappeared behind the limb of our roof. The light was white (not yellowish or bluish) and had no colored strobes that would be indicative of a terrestrial  aircraft, and exhibited no engine noise whatsoever. I strongly believe that this object was not from our neighbourhood if you will.;47.2123;-123.0971
Bright white light moving & slowly fading away;2015-09-29 21:07:00;<25 seconds;Bright white light moving & slowly fading away I had just sat down on the porch (facing NNW) for a smoke at 9:07pm PDT on 09-29-2015.  When I looked up,  I saw a bright white light approx. 50° up from the horizon to the north.  It had an apparent magnitude of -4.5 to -5 -- approximately that of the planet Venus at perigee from Earth.  It moved very slowly from N to S and began to decrease in intensity slowly and smoothly reaching extinction approx. 25 seconds after I first spotted it. The light color was pure white with no color tints though there ***MAY*** have been a faint reddish corona around it, when it was at maximum intensity. Weather conditions at the time were clear, temperature 54.10°F (12.28°C), and calm winds.;47.2123;-123.0971
Slow-flying lights were NOT a commercial airliner!;2016-03-29 20:51:00;~2 minutes;Slow-flying lights were NOT a commercial airliner! At 20:50, I went outside (NW-facing porch) for my after dinner smoke. Approx. 1 minute later,I saw something that I am unable to explain away. Approx. 1 mile (~1.61km) away, I spotted three lights at an azimuth of ~7° at a distance from me of approx. 1 mile (~1.61km):  one steady-on white light, trailed by a steady-on red light and a flashing red strobe just above it.   The lights appeared to be seperated by 250' (76.2M) to 300' (91.4M).  The thing that brought it to my attention was the very low airspeed -- it appeared to fly at ~80mph (128.8kph) which is far below the speed of a passenger aircraft at similar altitude. I was able to easily discern a low rumble -- presumably engine noise but I could very well be incorrect on this point. Weather conditions at the time were clear, temperature 47°F (8.3°C), and calm winds.;47.2123;-123.0971
