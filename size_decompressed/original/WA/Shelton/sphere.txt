I was outside looking at the sky and noticed a bright sphere to the south,  went and got binoculars and focused in on the sphere, it appeared to be a dark grey sphere with dimples in it, like a golf ball, it had a light in the center that illuminated it so i could see the color, it appeared to have anntennae like appendages, at this point i went and  got the video cam, leaned on the fence to stedy it up and noticed 2 more objects that appeared to be the same.  they were all stationary, one was fairly close, they were like in a triangle type formation but spread WAY out.  I have a about 10 mins of video of the objects, i could only film 2, but the quality is not very good as i was trying to zoom them in and would lose them.  I am self employed carpenter, with a fairly open mind.;47.2123;-123.0971
