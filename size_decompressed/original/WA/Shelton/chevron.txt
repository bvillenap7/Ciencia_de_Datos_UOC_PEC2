V-shaped object, glowing blue/grey moving straight and fast.;2014-11-29 20:30:00;7 seconds;V-shaped object, glowing blue/grey moving straight and fast. weather: clear, half moon shining, 28 degrees. craft moving southeast direction.  I thought initially it was at a low altitude because of its speed, but there was NO noise. craft was V shaped and glowing blue-grey.  my impression was that it must be larger than the glowing v, but I could not see anything more.  craft flew in a straight line in a southeast direction and covered the horizon in about 7 seconds. Weather:  clear starry night, 28 degrees. Craft flew straight SE at high speed (7 seconds through about 120 degrees of horizon.)  Craft was shaped as a 120 degree V, and glowing washed-out bluish grey. Craft was totally silent. There were 2 other aircraft in the nearby sky.
