My friend was having a sleep over on his birthday, and since it was so warm out we camped out in tents we were telling stories over the camp fire we said we would stay up untill the fire went out. Well after the fire finally went out we all turned over, and looked at all of the stars then all of a sudden three strange crafts flew over our tents about 250 yards up. They had extremely bright lights a redish, orange color we all got on our bikes and followed them (they were easy to follow on the account of the bright lights). We finally got to the bay after about half a mile of riding it stopped over the water and stayed there for ever we were about to leave when a bunch of really bright lights went off we could'nt see anything when the lights eventually went out they were gone we managed to get a picture of it. My friends our really flabergasted still to this day about what we saw we went home immediately and instead of staying outside any longer we went inside.;47.2123;-123.0971
I observed a straight line of 10-15 lights that resembled stars, spaced evenly apart traveling towards E.

They then went out of sight near the moon and venus.;47.2123;-123.0971
