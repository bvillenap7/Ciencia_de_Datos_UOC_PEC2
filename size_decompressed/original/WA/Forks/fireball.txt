Ball of fire floating over Forks, WA during the 4th of July fireworks display;2011-07-04 22:30:00;3 Minutes;Ball of fire floating over Forks, WA during the 4th of July fireworks display We were watching the fireworks display in Forks, when I noticed a small gold/orange ball of light approaching in the distance between two large trees.  I pointed it out to the others with me and we watched and listened assuming it was a small plane but there was no noise.  As it got closer the shape remained the same but the light it emitted was flickering as if it was made of fire.  For a while it looked like it was floating but it slowly made its way from North to South.   When it was almost directly over our car the light began to get dim and it went out.  When the light was out I could still barely make out the shape of the craft and it seemed to be grey in color.  It then veered quickly East and seemed to disappear.
