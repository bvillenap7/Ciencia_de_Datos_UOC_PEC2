Comet or craft?!;2019-05-25 23:00:00;1 minute;Comet or craft?! My husband and I were walking along the beach, watching the stars on a crystal clear evening, when we saw what we can only describe as a comet with intent.  Seemed to have a greenish yellow streak of light in front and a long trail, lighter in color following it. Traveling southwest at high speeds it almost seemed to crash into a satelight or other small, fast moving object of much, much smaller size.  Our dog responded but were unsure if it was due to our excitement.  It was like witnessing a scene out of Star Wars.  Hoping others saw it too, as it was Memorial Day weekend and tons of coastal campers were on the beach.;47.9306;-124.4022
