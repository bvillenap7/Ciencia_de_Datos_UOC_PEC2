Solid white light being followed by U.S. fighter jet.;2013-08-15 22:55:00;2 minutes;Solid white light being followed by U.S. fighter jet. On August 15, 2013, my wife and I were sitting in our side yard watching the sky.  While looking up we spotted what appeared to be a satellite in the sky cross out field of vision from the north moving south.  Once observing that object, we looked down for 2-3 seconds only to see that it was now gone after looking to the sky again.   As soon as we didn't see the object anymore, we then heard a jet engine from a U.S. fighter jet (they fly in the area often, except not at night).  After hearing the jet we then witnessed a white light moving quietly from the west towards the east at a moderately slow pace followed by a turbine jet engine.  As we were watching the two flying craft, you could see that there was a difference between the two since the jet had the left blinking red wing light that's on the underside of the craft.  And the white light object had no blinking lights, only pure white solid light and was completely quiet. I myself am a college student and have been with the Army NG for 10+ years.  I've been deployed twice and have been around different jets since I lived on one of the largest airbases while deployed to Iraq. My wife is a teacher and graduated from Gonzaga University, with a bachelors in Education (special education/general education).;47.9306;-124.4022
