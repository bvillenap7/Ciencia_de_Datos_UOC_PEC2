The ufo was spotted at apppox. 6:40 PM and was seen through 6:47 PM. At first we thought it was an airplane, due to the loud airplane like sound we heard.  We looked up at the sky to locate where the airplane was. Instead we saw a large red light moving about in the sky in large circles. The object intentionally stopped near the moon for what seemed like a look.  After two minutes, another light paralell to the other appeared. We now think this might have been the back end of the craft.  The lights quickly jolyed back and forth in the sky unlike an airplanes capibilities.  When reaching the moon for the third time the object shot down towards the earth as if landing but was not seen afterwards. We have three photos taken.  After the sighting, we did reasearch, and have come to the conclusion that we have had an encounter of the first kind. We are almost certain it was a cigar shaped object, yet no evidence has been found yet.;47.9306;-124.4022
