Saw an ovalish light zooming threw the sky. starting from the big dipper, heading South towards the moon faster than an airplane or a satellite or anything of you can think of that flys threw outerspace. and about 5 minutes later one of the witnesses thinks she might have saw another one that only went for about 15-20 seconds and then it was gone. It was heading about southwest in the sky. ((names and e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));48.9045;-122.3325
