triangular formation of white lights moving  and making a 180 degree turn;2002-09-01 23:15:00;1 minute;triangular formation of white lights moving  and making a 180 degree turn We were skywatching at James Gillilands ranch (Sattva Sanctuary) last Sunday.  There was another group there 150 yards to our west, The Greer Group (Disclosure Project).  Just before our sighting many of them were yelling excitedly.  My wife Ferne and I searched the sky to see what the excitement was about.  Ferne saw it first right overhead and it was three lights moving in an elongated triangle formation.  One of the trailing lights was a little ahead of the other.  Was moving slowly from north to south.  After a few seconds it made a banking 180 degree turn returning to the direction it came from and the lights kept in formation.  About 3 seconds after the turn all three lights gradually faded. There was no noise and a clear moonless night. The formation was directly overhead of us. Saw another triangular formation last year about this time but it did not turn as this one did. We did not see an object enclosed within the light formation. I tried to video this event but it did not record. I was trying to video record the lights and as soon as my wife said its a triangle the camera stopped recording and the tape was blank upon review. I did not get any video of it. I had the formation in view all the time as I thought I was recording. In one year of skywatching this is best sighting I have experienced. The lights did not strobe or look like lights on a plane. The lights were white but rather dim. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for the interesting report! I have a few questions about your sighting.  First, what was the apparent size of the formation of three lights, relative to the size of the disc of a full Moon, please?  Also, did the entire formation bank, or the individual lights?  What direction did the object turn, please?  Did it end up going to the east, or to the west? Did you look for the object on the following night, by any chance, or on any subsequent night? Also, when the lights faded, did they all fade together, or did they fade at different times?  If the latter, which one faded first, they subsequently? You state that one of the trailing lights was a little ahead of the other.  Do you mean that there were two behind, and one of them was a bit ahead of the other? Thank you very much for your report.  We will post it in the near future.  I do not know what it was you saw, but we would like to know more. Cordially, Peter Davenport Peter:  The size was about was a little larger than a full moon.  The entire formation made a banking right turn (east) and the lights stayed in the same relative position turning east and continuing to turn untill a 180 degree turn had been made to go back north. So after the turn it was going north.  The next night we decided to go home since I had to work the next day and clouds were building up.   All three lights faded out together.   ((NUFORC Note:  Triangular formation of X's deleted here.  They will not survive the transfer to the website.  PD))         The formation look somewhat like this, the top being the leading light.   We are going back to Mt adams Friday for two nights of skywatching since we were quite excited to see this.  The Greer group is supposed to be there untill sunday.  We are not part of the group, and the leader of the group has requested privacy from the rest of the guests while they are there.  We have been helping James with maintenance of one of the buildings and helping out in general.  We go there quite frequently when the weather is good to skywatch.  I have seen many moving lights while there over the past year, but this one is the most unusual I have ever seen anywhere and needed to be reported.  As far as I know satellites cannot do this and it definatly was not an airplane.   The one we saw last year looked like this:   ((NUFORC Note:  Triangular formation of X's deleted here.  PD))     It did not turn, was about  the same brightness, and when it faded out the lead light went out first and when the two trailing lights reached the same place they went out together.  The size was slighty larger than the one we have just seen.       If you have any more questions feel free to send an email..  ((name deleted))   ((SECOND COMMUNICATION)) Peter:  My callendar says August 18 2001.  My sister was up from California, saw it,  and my wife ((name deleted)) was there too and saw it.

Oregon UFO Review Case:  Triangle formations over Washington and Oregon checked against satellite data...OUFOR.;2002-09-01 23:59:00;1 minute;((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Eric Byler of Oregon UFO Review for submitting the following data.  PD)) Triangle formations over Washington and Oregon checked against satellite data...OUFOR. Two team members/investigators for Oregon UFO Research, a husband and wife team, were staying at James Gillilands Sattva Sanctuary over the Labor Day weekend as they frequently do to skywatch near the base of Mt Adams in Trout Lake Washington. Steven Greers group (Disclosure Project) was there on their first night of skywatching during their week long stay in the area for their paid conference. Mr. Greer was not there at the time and was to arrive a few days later. The husband and wife were approximately 150 yards east of the Greer group for their skywatch along the driveway from the main road into the house. A few minutes after 11:00 p.m. they heard several people in the Greer group to their left shouting in an excited fashion for several seconds. Wondering what the shouting was about they both searched the sky to see what they were looking at. The wife saw it first and it was a triangle. The form was an uneven elongated triangle with one of the trailing lights ahead of its counterpart. The Brightness was dim but was readily discernible as moving together in formation. The husband hastily got out his camcorder and tried to video the object. He could see it in his camera and, after a few seconds, it made a banking turn and headed back the same direction that it came from. Approximately three seconds after it had made the turn, all three lights faded out together. Throughout the whole sighting the three lights stayed in formation and kept the same brilliance. Here is a computer rendition of that sighting by team member Cameron Johnson in the modeling department... http://www.oregonuforeview.com/MTADAMS.jpg It was headed from north to south and after the turn it headed back the way it came and rapidly went out. The weather was clear and there are no streetlights in the area. The milky way was readily visible. There was no moon. Everyone who was outside skywatching saw the object or formation...over 15 people. There was no object visible within the lights as they were not markers. There was no sound, or visible trails from it. Its size was about half a hand at arms length. Bill and Ferne were facing north when they saw it and it was directly overhead. There were no obstructions and they report having an excellent view. This is a substantial sighting and team members ((three names deleted)) will be getting together with the witnesses soon to fill out a detailed report form and gather any further information available. Friday, September 6th update...We have recieved NOSS Triad Satellite information for the evening of the sighting and, if in fact these times are correct, indicate that this sighting WAS NOT not satellites. However, at 11:30, a half hour later, another report was submitted from Clackamas, Oregon.  The witness writes... At 11:30 p.m., I observed three objects traveling from the NW to SE at satellite speed. The objects were as bright as the brightest star. They formed a triangle, one flying directly behind the lead object at some distance (close enough to be considered flying together). The third object was about 45 degrees from the tailing object, closer in the formation, that is between the lead object and its' trailer. The objects were observed both with the naked eye and through 10X50 binoculars. Duration of observation was about 20 seconds, then the objects disappeared after flying directly overhead. This may have been a result of the reflection from the sun being out of reflective range. The same NOSS triad satellite information for the evening of this sighting shows that this may well be NOSS triad satellites. Date Mag Time Alt. Az. Time Alt. Az. Time Alt. Az.

The sighting from Mt. Adams Washington appears to be an authentic unknown triangle formation as seen at 11pm, while a similar sighting over Clackamas Oregon at 11:30 appears to be NOSS triad satellites.  Both sighting findings were based on satellite tracking information. Eric Byler - assistant director, Oregon UFO Research. Editor - Oregon UFO Review. http://www.oregonuforeview.com;45.9808;-121.5212
Triangle formation at trout lake, have video;2002-09-07 22:48:00;20 seconds;Triangle formation at trout lake, have video We were at James Gillilands Sattva Sanctuary in Trout Lake Washington Saturday September 7 skywatching.  This was the last night of the Greer Groups (Cecti) stay.  We had been skywatching since sundown.   Just before 10:48 pm my wife said to me there were two lights traveling together.  Since I usually try and video anything unsual I found the two lights and started recording. Upon closer view with the camera I saw it was an elongated triangular formation of three lights. There was no moon or obstructions to the viewing. The formation was to our left and in the direction of James house west of us. My effort to capture the formation on video was sucessfull this time and I have a video of it.  The formation was heading from north to south and it was to the west of where we were. The lead light went out after a few seconds and the two trailing lights went out in approximately the same place.  There was no sound. X south                         X            north X This is what it looked like as it traveled from north to south. The lights were fairly dim but can be seen clearly on the video. I have a sony 130 digital camera with nightshot and a Bower 2.5 telephoto lens attached. There were several more witnesses. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have observed the three satellites, which are reported to NUFORC frequently, and which were observed from the same location on September 01, 2002.  We attempted to correspond via e-mail with the witness who submitted this report, but the e-address he provided is defective.  Please see sighting from Castleton, VT, for the same date as this report.  That report may be based on a sighting of the same suspected satellites.  The manner in which they were reported to fade over Vermont is consistent with satellites flying into the Earth's shadow.  PD));45.9808;-121.5212
I was attending a three-day symposium at the Sattva Sanctuary near Mount Adams, a spiritual sanctuary that is known for its UFO sightin;2006-08-18 21:30:00;approx. 1 minute;I was attending a three-day symposium at the Sattva Sanctuary near Mount Adams, a spiritual sanctuary that is known for its UFO sightings.  Just before the first of two sky watches was held, a bunch of us headed for the parking lot for our lawn chairs and jackets.  Someone yelled to look up at the eastern sky, and we observed an object that I could not explain -- it was a tiny dot that would flare brilliantly (white) into what I saw as an almost triangular shape.  I swear I also saw what looked like two faint stick-like protuberances on either side.  The object then went back to its regular very faint dot, then flared brightly a couple of more times before becoming so faint that it eventually disappeared.  I frankly was so taken by the beauty of the thing that I didn't pay much attention to speed (it was moving from north to south).  It would be interesting if some of my fellow witnesses would come forward and give their own version of what they saw.  I found that this was the best sighting (for me) of my three days there.  I sat for several hours in the sky watches and did see some objects that did not behave like the airplanes, shooting stars, and satellites I did observe in the beautiful crystal-clear night skies outside of Trout Lake.  I suppose you would call these UFOs since I could not identify them!;45.9808;-121.5212
