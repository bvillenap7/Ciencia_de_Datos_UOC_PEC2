A large group of people were enjoying a camp fire and watching satellites and shooting stars cross the sky, an unusually slow moving satellite moving from the north to south over Mt. Adams area caught everyone's attention.  It at first appeared to be just a satellite(small and white) and we watched it for about 5 seconds when it began inflating into a perfect sphere of solid brilliant orange light which was at least 3-4 times it's original size. It continued in the same direction and same speed displaying this absolutely gorgeous brilliant orange light-so bright that it was fire ballish in brilliance. The orange light  was absolutely opaque displaying a well defined crisp spherical shape, the light was extremely concentrated and brilliant. There was no hazy light  or fan out around the object, there was no tail.  It continued to travel as this inflated fireball for 5-10 seconds. It then deflated and returned to it's original satellite appearance (small and white) for another 5-10 seconds until it faded into the night sky. It did not change speed or direction.;45.9808;-121.5212
Four UFOs in less than 2 hours, all of which parked above us, witnessed by a dozen people.;2005-06-04 22:15:00;1hr 45min;Four UFOs in less than 2 hours, all of which parked above us, witnessed by a dozen people. Here's my UFO witness report from Saturday June 4, 2005.  I tried to power up my digital (still) camera for the really awesome one of the four UFOs I saw that would have shown you something interesting, but was too late to capture it.  BTW, these are the first UFO’s I’ve ever seen.    We were 13 miles South of Mt. Adams looking towards the mountain at 10:15 pm Saturday night until midnight.   Here's a synopsis:  First sighting: a star sized white light UFO was crossing the sky directly above us going from approximately North to South at a fairly fast clip, and was snaking perhaps 10 degrees back and forth by several nearby stars.  It moved across the sky for about 20 to 30 degrees of arc, and stopped, parked there and dimmed.  With the hundreds of stars visible and the fact that it stopped moving, I soon lost track of the UFO's exact position.  Another witness had a telephoto lens and saw a red light attached to its tail, while it was moving.  I managed to spot this UFO first, as I have excellent long range vision.  Second sighting: a brighter star sized UFO came into view from the East traveling in a Westerly direction.  It traveled for about 10 to 15 degrees of arc across the sky at about a 60 degree angle from the ground.  Then, in a very short space, it took a smooth 30-40 degree arcing turn to the NNW, traveled a short distance, and stopped high above Mt Adams.  No dimming.  Lost site of it among the hundreds of stars that were out (I can only go so long without blinking!). Third (and best) sighting: A medium bright, star sized UFO came in from the WSW, meandered somewhat randomly for 10-15 degrees of arc, heading in an Easterly direction.  It stopped right next to a dimmer star.  Suddenly it lit up.  I don't mean it got a little brighter it got hundreds of times brighter than it was.  Imagine Mars, when in view, is the brightest object in the sky by 2-3 times the brightest stars in the sky, and multiply that by 50-100 times. The lighting up lasted for 3-5 seconds, then dimmed to a faint star in size and brightness, and moved off into space, dimming to nothing, within a couple arc degrees, in a snaking trajectory, heading ENE.  When that UFO lit up, the dozen or so people there reacted with awe, cheering and yelling for more.  That UFO was just letting us know it was undeniably there and perhaps saying Hi -  I was extremely impressed... Absolutely drop dead awesome!!!!!!   Fourth sighting: A star sized UFO traveling from the North and very dim, was moving South when it flashed like a strobe pulse, maybe 5-10 times brighter than Mars would be, then returned to a very dim object (barely visible). A few seconds later, it flashed again, and dimmed. This scenario repeated 10-15 times while crossing directly overhead, and traveling 30-40 degrees of the sky, changing directions several times, along the way. The flashes were randomly timed, varying from a second to several seconds in between. The UFO then stopped almost directly above us, and parked there for the rest of the night, dim and unmoving. It was SE of the big dipper, then, and was aligned to two stars below it, where I could see and check on it, and it didn't move again.  During the viewing time I saw a shooting star (which I've seen dozens of before), and airplanes, which were obvious by their trajectories, flashing colored lights, straight traverses and speeds. Observed them many times before. The four UFO sightings, above, were nothing of the kind. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain what the witness observed, but we have an opinion on the third and fourth sightings.  The third is not inconsistent with the flash of an Iridium satellite.  Data for the evening of June 4th, 2005, can be seen below:   04 Jun 04:51:10 -1 18° 80° (E ) 69.9 km (E) -6 Iridium 96  04 Jun 05:13:47 -5 17° 33° (NNE) 1.8 km (W) -5 Iridium 28  04 Jun 23:01:56 -7 28° 40° (NE ) 4.8 km (W) -7 Iridium 17  05 Jun 03:23:02 -1 42° 127° (SE ) 34.4 km (W) -8 Iridium 25  05 Jun 04:37:20 -1 18° 80° (E ) 64.3 km (E) -6 Iridium 28  http://www.heavens-above.com/iridium.asp?lat=45.998&lng=-121.527&alt=579&loc=Trout+Lake&TZ=PST&Date=38507.4153333333&Dur=2 An Iridium flare would have been visible for a few seconds in the northeast sky.  The reports appears to us to be consistent with the direction a witness would have to have been looking, in order to witness the flare.   The fourth sighting is not inconsistent with a tumbling booster in space, but that is only a guess.   PD));45.9808;-121.5212
UFO light ship with power up cruising over our camp out.;2013-08-18 22:18:00;30-60 seconds;UFO light ship with power up cruising over our camp out. Over the course of this multi day event I saw in excess of 40 UFOs and I was only doing serious night time photography on Sunday evening.  During the previous evening we saw over 35 UFOs but I was otherwise occupied with a new romantic interest to care much about grabbing my camera.  Although, on Sunday evening after she had departed I was shooting with a Sony A-65 with a standard 18-55 mm lens using a tripod doing 10 second exposures with 24 mega-pixel resolution in night mode.  I had just captured a photo of our crew singing around an open field when we saw a UFO suddenly appear in the sky.  I was easily able to swivel my camera about 90 degrees, elevate the camera and snap a photo of the UFO.  The UFO began traveling towards us over the field and did what's referred as a power up wherein the brightness increases of the UFO.  It's hard to tell the altitude of the UFO but I would estimate that it was at least a mile overhead. The UFO then phased out and vanished.  This is similar behavior that the majority of the other UFOs exhibited over that weekend.  Many times the UFOs changed direction, sped up and slowed down, zig-zaged and phased in and out of visibility.  Most where white in color and round in shape. Often there would be a couple of UFO appearing at the same time but most where single occurrences.  I did not see any metal or hear any sounds associated with the UFO craft. The moon was almost full that night and was behind us. We had already seen the international space station fly overhead which was really bright and travelled linearly across the entire sky. I had also seen a few conventional aircraft fly overhead with their bright strobe lights clearly visible. I took a few photos of those aircraft as a reference. There were about ten other persons present in my immediate vicinity who all saw the same object and who all believed it to be a UFO. I will also clearly state that this gathering was alcohol and drug free. I am a professional videographer and I also have a fair amount of experience with digital still cameras. I have never filmed or photographed a UFO before but I've always had a big interest in airplanes and aviation history.  I have worked for Boeing for a number of years and have seen and discussed many types of conventional aircraft.  I was not able to associate these UFOs with any other craft that I have studied before.  I have worked professionally with technology for 13 years and I have spent a lot of time studying the best way to capture light.;45.9808;-121.5212
