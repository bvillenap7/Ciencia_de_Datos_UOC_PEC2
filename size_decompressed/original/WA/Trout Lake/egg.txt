Orange egg shaped object headed towards Mount Adams in Wa;2008-08-30 23:00:00;2+ hours;Orange egg shaped object headed towards Mount Adams in Wa I do not wish to exploit this location, but there is contact between citizens and these crafts. I will not give out any information leading back to them. Just letting all of you readers know that I out of hundreds who've witnessed first hand flying objects not of this world's origin. Perhaps it is from Earth... I personally don't really know. The orange objects hovering above our heads was an egg/fluid like shape. Wasn't transparent, but maybe the walls were transparent and filled with a orange ball of goo. This was witnessed when the sun went down and objects were sparking in the distance infront of the mountain where during the day time it would appear as dead space (nothing able to hang lights or in the mountain to shine super bright lights like sparking lights. My friends and I were laid back about the whole thing, and it brought excitement to us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
