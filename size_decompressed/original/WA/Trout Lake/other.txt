Light over Mt. Adams;2011-08-10 21:30:00;1hr+;Light over Mt. Adams My family and I went camping in the Mt Adams area.  At the camp site we were at it had a very clear view of the mountain.  We purposely went out to look for UFOs and were surprised to see a flashing light on the side of the mountain.   After watching it for about 5mins it started moving straight up in the air and then just stopped.  It was pulsating lights red, green and primarily white.  It seemed as though the lights were moving around in a triangle.  At one time the white lights seemed to arrange themselves in a row of three at the bottom. My brother-in-law kept saying it was a star, but the stars did not move (except for the rotation of the earth).  I was watching the star movement in relation to a tree as a marker.  The movement was not even close to the movement of the object.  My mother, sister, brouther-in-law watched the object for about an hour.  It seemed to stay in one position although at one point it seemed to come closer as we were using a high! power flashlight to signal it.  After an hour it seems to just fade away.  We went out the next night about the same time, but we had collected a group of people because we set up telescopes.  Nothing appeared, but when the people left the object appeared almost immediately!  We watched in again for about 45mins.  My sister says that a disk like oject formed but when I looked it had reverted to the light formation.  This night it was only my sister, mother and myself.  I started feelong really uncomfortable watching it so we went in earlier. It was still in the sky at that time.  Again I watched the star positioning with relation to a tree from the same spot in the area.;45.9808;-121.5212
