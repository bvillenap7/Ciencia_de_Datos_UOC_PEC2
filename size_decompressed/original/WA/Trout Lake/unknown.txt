Craft landing on Mt. Adams;2006-10-13 13:00:00;5 minutes;Craft landing on Mt. Adams I arrived at Trout Lake, Washington on Mt. Adams at the UFO santuary and observation area, they held a UFO conference in August.  Walking into the observation field with Mt. Adams in the background, I saw portions of a craft wavering, somewhat similar to seeing something through water (an aura or haze).  Shortly an entity appeared, my friend wanted to see him as well but was not sensitive.  I pointed to where he was at and asked him to put his hand in that area the air felt smooth with the ET's presence.  My friend compaired the energy to another space, which it was definately different.  We both received answers to some questions in life we had and they left.
