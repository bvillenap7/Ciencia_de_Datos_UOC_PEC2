Overlooking the West Side of Mt. Adams. Witnesses: 4 adults, 1 teenager. Description of Sighting:  At roughly 0100 on the morning of August 28, 2009, five people were star gazing on a U.S. Forest Service road on the east border of the Indian Heaven Wilderness.  We had a fairly good view of the sky towards the East.  A person sighted a blinking white light.  This person alerted the rest of the group and all five people began to observe this light.  It would blink on, then blink off.  It seemed as if every time it blinked off, it would blink on again at a different point in the sky.  At first it seemed to have a general direction of South to North.  However, after 4 or 5 blinks it moved in the opposite direction.  Every blink had the same intensity of white light, however altitude and direction seemed to vary.  It made one final blink, turned off and then an even brighter white light came on and accelerated at a downward trajectory towards us.  It seemed that it was going to hit us when it angled up into the sky at thousands of miles per hour leaving a reddish white trail that arced across the entire visible sky.  The composition of the trail the craft left behind seemed to have a reddish white, very bright dusty appearance. P.S. Upon returning from our trip, I was looking at my digital camera pictures.  I have found numerous photographic anomalies in 5 or so pictures of dark objects in the general direction of our sighting over and in front of the Western side of Mt. Adams.  I would be willing to send these photos via email upon request.;45.9808;-121.5212
