Object: White strobe-like single flash (Extremely bright). Irregular intervals.  Aprox distance: 2-3 miles  I had first seen this flash to the North of Mt adams out of the corner of my eye. I thought it was a meteor. Aprox. 30-45 seconds later I saw another bright single flash a little further south from the first. At this point I asked the attention of my friend 19 year old son, I told him just watch toward the mountain, which was faintly visible in the darkness. It flashed again, this time a little further south aprox. 20 seconds from the last flash. We continued watching, the flash occured again, this time a little further south and slightly higher in altitude. Mind you, this is passing between us and the mountain at this point(also:there are NO roads at that altitude on Adams, I was trying to rule out possible explainations at this point)as we continued to watch there was one final flash, this time, just above and to the south of the summit. This flash appeared to be brighter with the edition of a large streak that appeared to shoot west and upward. This was the last time we saw the object/light. Two days later I saw the Indian Ranger and said briefly what I saw and before I finished he saidUFO, I saw it to  No sounds or shapes were apparent.;45.9808;-121.5212
