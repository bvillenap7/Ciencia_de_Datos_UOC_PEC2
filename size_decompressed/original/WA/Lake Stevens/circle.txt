While observing fireworks on callow rd., my step daughter pointed at it and asked what it was.  Then we all watched a glowing orange ball in the bottom of broken clouds, move in a slow, tight, S. It then seemed to drop towards us slightly and pause, as if it was checking us out and then it went much faster straight to the southwest.  A firework went off and we lost sight of it.   The entire event took only 30 seconds or so and we did not have a ready camera. There was not any detectable noise.  I could see that it was not a plane or helicopter and could not have been a flare or any type of balloon.  I spent the rest of the night scanning the sky, hoping to see it again. My grandma used to live there and says she has saw the same thing several times but nobody believed her. Also, my cousin who owns the home now has saw the same thing a few times.;48.0132;-122.0679
