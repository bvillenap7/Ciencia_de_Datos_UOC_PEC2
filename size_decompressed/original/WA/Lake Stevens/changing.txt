Odd multishaped Orange Orbs Seen Over Western Washington- Cascade Foothills, North Sound, Snohomish Co..;2013-11-24 18:26:00;30 seconds;Odd multishaped Orange Orbs Seen Over Western Washington- Cascade Foothills, North Sound, Snohomish County Intersection of Highway 92 and Grade Road.  While Traveling south on Grade Road towards downtown Lake Stevens, I observed 3 distinct orange orb like structures, ascending towards the North-North East.  These 3 objects were oval and large in size and each changed into larger cigar shape at the base, relative to the landscape horizon and was moving in a deliberate synchronous fashion in a slanted vertical organized formation.   The middle orb stopped in midflight, flashed red and white in a rotating pattern at the base of the orb for 10 seconds then vanished,  The pattern of light emitting from the orb as it stopped looked as if it was a double triangular array, one on top of the other.   The first orb followed and also vanished.  The last orb in the vertical line of ascension rapidly continued to ascend until out of site of the naked eye.   This event was witnessed under clear skies, and lasted approximately 30 seconds total in duration.;48.0132;-122.0679
