It was on the NW horizon above a 3400 foot range of mountains and very high in the sky and far away. I looked again with binoculars and was amazed to see the object was actually egg-shaped its surface was covered with flashing lights.  I saw the colors amber, blue-green, and red all flashing independently of each other. As the object very slowly moved east its shape seemed to change to cigar--almost as though it had tipped on its side or turned. It continued to flash, the colors so bright it looked like a carnival ride in the sky.  It then flashed only one color in different places on its surface--all amber, all bluish-green, all red. At one point it began to climb higher in a zig-zag pattern--slowly, almost meandering, then continued east again.  I watched it until it began to disappear and reappear because a stand of tall fir trees in a nearby yard was making observation difficult.;45.6327;-121.1717
