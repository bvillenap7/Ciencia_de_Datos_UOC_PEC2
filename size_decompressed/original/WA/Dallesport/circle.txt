Bright light moving east sighted from the Columbia River gorge;2007-06-18 22:00:00;25 minutes;Bright light moving east sighted from the Columbia River gorge Upon first observing the object it looked like a very large bright ball low on the southern horizon, rather like a large star or planet.  The area where I live, just east of the Columbia River gorge, is situated in a kind of bowl with up to 3400 ft. mountains surrounding it.   I was driving across the river to The Dalles, OR. and I noticed it was getting brighter.  Getting out of the car back home about 15 minutes later I saw the object begin moving east on a straight course.   It was solid white with no blinking lights like planes have.  In fact, there was a jet (it did have blinking lights) in the same area going in the opposite direction and by comparison the object was moving much faster.   By the time I got inside, grabbed the binoculars, and got back outside, the object had moved out of sight.;45.6327;-121.1717
