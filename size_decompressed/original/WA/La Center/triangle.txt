triangular craft spotted in washington state;2003-11-14 17:00:00;7 minutes;triangular craft spotted in washington state It was approaching darkness. We were driving in the northern direction. We saw what appeared to be a very slow moving plane or a very large star. As we drove closer we realized it couldn't be either. Next, a helicopter came to mind. Though none of us had seen any helicoper with such a style and wing span. It was triangular and there we blue lights on the far sides and in the center a large white light ... accompanied by a small red light right below it. It stayed completely still until we drove past. At this time we looked behind us and saw it moving in our direction. We continued driving north in the direction of our homes. As we turned the last curve we saw it coming over the hill side. Later my friend reported that it disappeared shortly after she dropped me off.;45.8812;-122.622
