On the evening of Oct. 19 at approx. 6:30 pm my son and I were hunting in a secluded, reforested area near our home.  We were standing in a clearing that had visibility of approx. a 40 yard radius.  Skies were clear and it was nearing dusk.  We were wearing hunter orange clothing, very bright, one of us with an orange hat.  My son was facing South, I the North, back to back.  It was quite.  A  noise that resembled, at first, the sound faintly of a grouse in flight.  But the intensity and frequency of the sound changed rapidly.  Within a second the sound came to us, stopped over our heads, and resinated above us for approx. 3 seconds in a stationary mode.  It then it seemed to accelerate and was gone.  It was like something came in to check us out and then leave.We were looking over our heads and all around us during this time, but saw nothing. The noise seemed to encompass us and seemed to be coming from above us, but every time we looked in any direction the intensity of the noise was the same. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness.  He sounds quite credible to us.  Please see reports of object captured on video tape by a FOX 23 television photographer over Albany, NY, on October 20, 2002.  PD));45.8812;-122.622
