La Center WA:  October 3, 2015, 8:30 p.m. - While looking at stars with my granddaughter, we saw a bright moving object which we thought was a satellite.  However, it quickly disappeared.  Then another bright object appeared, traveled a short distance and also disappeared.  We continued looking at CLEAR night sky and saw a few satellites move across the sky which we tracked until they went out of view.  I have no idea what the two objects were that suddenly appeared and then vanished.  They were very high in sky and no sound at all.  Leaves me wondering what we saw?

Stream of bright lights evenly spaced and evenly apart traveling northeast.;2019-12-09 05:00:00;Ten minutes;Stream of bright lights evenly spaced and evenly apart traveling northeast. Was on the phone looking out my back door when I noticed several bright stars in a straight line and evenly apart. Commenting to the person on the phone how strange that was so I stepped outside. I then noticed that these were traveling northeast.  I was looking to see if they were coming from the west like I had seen other satellites do.  These were dropping in one at a time straight overhead.  Very bright as if twenty north stars following each other. To bright to be a traditional satellite I have seen before.  Were these starlight satellites?;45.8812;-122.622
