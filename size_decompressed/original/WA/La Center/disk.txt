While driving south bound on I5 from Woodland,WA to Vancouver, WA right past Paradise lake in the sky at 10:05 am we witnessed a very large flat cylinder shaped object that was refective and appeared to be silver like and clear almost as if you could see through a some like top.  The object was so large that it was clearly not flying in any such manor.  It was still and had no flashing lights but the size was so massive in comparison to a plane that we had seen a few minutes later that appeared to be following the objects path.  The object remained still for about 90 seconds and the dipped east and then vanished.  The object left no trails in the clouds or sky.;45.8812;-122.622
