revolving multi-colored lights;1999-09-03 21:00:00;30 minutes;revolving multi-colored lights We were at my sister's 21 acre parcel of land, at the 4,000 foot elevation level. It's a remote area above the Aeneas Valley, just south of Turner Lake. I was looking to the north (looking at the stars). I saw in the distance, at about 2 fists high above horizon(approx 20 degrees), a very-very slow moving light, moving west to east. Through my 210mm zoom camera lens, it appeared to be revolving lights-green, red, yellow, blue, and white. All the colors revolved around a center point. It revolved in a counter-clockwise manner. I had my tri-pod and camera,;48.7194;-119.3943
varying speed pulsating light, very bright to very dim;1999-09-04 23:00:00;20 minutes;varying speed pulsating light, very bright to very dim Looking due east, we spotted a slow to moderate pulsating light,(there was no consistant timing to the pulsing, it varied in length). It was surrounded by a hazy halo of light that never changed in intensity. It was a very clear night. None of the other stars surrounding it changed in intensity or had halos. The light varied from very bright-as bright as a full moon, to so dim as to disappear, the object was similar in size at its brightest as Jupiter would be in the night sky. It never moved in any direction. We were in a remote area above the Aeneas Valley, about the 4,000 foot elevation level, south of Turner Lake.;48.7194;-119.3943
Very bright light came from West directly under big dipper.;2000-04-11 05:10:00;10 seconds;Very bright light came from West directly under big dipper. The lite seemed to be floating but was moving toward me from the West directly under the Big Dipper.  There was no sound.  After I had watched it for about 5 seconds I saw a blank space in the middle that gave it the appearance of two chevrons of bright lite stuck together. Then it immediately went out: zip nada nothing left.  It  was eerie. On 4/7/00 my husband and I had observed same lite (10xs bigger than Saturn.) This time it was higher in sky and was not moving forward.  We did not see any blank spaces. That night it faded then blinked out. The nite of 4/07/00 there were two jets doing some kind of maneuvers in the sky just prior to sighting.  We had been watching them and when they were headed East over the mountains to Fairchild (we assumed) was when we saw the light.;48.7194;-119.3943
I was standing in driveway (rural area no exterior lighting) taking a smoke break, it was dark, no moon, very quiet, when i noticed it ;2000-04-20 19:55:00;2min;I was standing in driveway (rural area no exterior lighting) taking a smoke break, it was dark, no moon, very quiet, when i noticed it starting to gradually getting lighter around my area.  It was a slow process, and I didnt notice it at first as i was thinking of other things.  It reached the intesity of a bright moonlight night in a area about the 1 acre in size.  I noticed a bright light over head the intensity of a landing light on a plan at about 1 mile. When i looked up the light started to fade as if on a reastat.  There was absolutly no sound, and it was very still, and I am used to looking and hearing all forms of aircraft. There is nothing that could produce the intesity of light and not be heard.;48.7194;-119.3943
