Red/Green lights with sharp movements near tonasket Washington in 1992;1992-07-10 22:00:00;30 mins;Red/Green lights with sharp movements near tonasket Washington in 1992 In 1992 I was working to cap the abandoned Silver/Gold mine outside of Tonasket Washington:   http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/nplpad.nsf/88d393e4946e3c478825631200672c95/3eeeba55f1df5d948525659f00573826?OpenDocument A co-worker and I were designated as overnight site security and were staying in a motor home at the site.  Sometime after dark, I was outside the trailer looking around the site.  I looked out and saw two red/green constantly changing glowing lights hovering erratically between 2 mountaintops to the North-East far in the distance.  After watching the lights for a few minutes one of the lights moved incredibly fast and sharp in the sky.  The distance was incredible. Almost as if it was transporting from one place to the next.  Over the next 30 mins this happened 7-8 more times. Each of the lights moving at sharp angles.  It seemed as if the movements were unstable.  I called the other worker out to tell me if he was seeing what I was seeing.  I had him tell me! when he saw the lights move.  After confirming that I was not just seeing things I resigned to the fact that it was unexplainable.  I went into the trailer for a bit and when I came back out I was watching the lights again.  Only one light was remaining when I returned.  While I was watching this the one light shot off to the right in a straight direct line into infinity in about 1-2 seconds.  Behind the light was a small trail of white light that dissipated quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary time above, in order to reflect a nighttime sighting.
