Ranier, traveling north up auburn valley.  Stopped, hovered for a few minutes, then went east and disappered I was on my balcony and happened to look up and see an orange flickering orb in the sky hovering east of my house about 5000 feet in the sky.  I called my family out to witness what I was seeing.  It slowly moved up and east and the light dimmed. Moments later another object moved from behind the trees from the south heading northwest toward my location, closer than the first.  I flashed an LED light at it, and it immediately dimmed out. Me and my family were startled and scared.  I told them to go inside.   A minute later another one appeared from same location coming even closer to my location, Lower, faster, brighter.  It was flickering and stopped in almost the same spot in the sky but lower than the other two.   I took photographs of all three objects.  They would not appear in the viewfinder/screen of my digital camera.   The only time I could see what I was photographing was after I took a photo. The last object hovered longer but subsequently moved in the same direction as the rest and disappeared.   After the event all of the Aircraft from boeing field and sea- tac flew around this area,  I live and the objects were in a flight path for incoming and departing flights.   They seemed to have changed there pattern which Ive never seen happen. ((NUFORC Note:  We are unconvinced as to whether this is, in fact, a serious-minded report.  PD));47.2694;-122.2478
