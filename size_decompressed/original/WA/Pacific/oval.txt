Pacific Algona 167 SB UFO observery datetime in traffic;2007-02-17 03:30:00;40 minutes;Pacific Algona 167 SB UFO observery datetime in traffic After coming back from court On Thursday, 3:30pm, (Feb 2007) I entered the 167 southbound freeway, heading south.  Traffic was conditions were mild to moderate congestion, at a pace of 60 to 70 mph, then all of a sudden the traffic went to a near stop pace at 25mph on the freeway?  Insane, so I swerved in my Acura Integra to lean into the left lane to see what is the hold up.  Then I see this dot, greyish in the atmosphere hovering in no motion at the right side view of MT Rainer which would align over the city of Orting at my best guessing.  I would not speculate that it an air force plane as i am quite familar with the plane flights.  I tried to get my camera and video tape it but the upcoming bridge was in the way.  Traffic still slowed a near stop.  I did my best to observe the dot,.  This is when I notice a dance behavior that is unlike any known earth design technology. right to left, now think of the given distance between my position relative to Paci! fic Algona to Orting Washington, for an object to dance hover in the sky above Orting, then it darted to my right and disappeared.  The news said it was a Japanese satelite, I have seen the ISS and the shuttle in space at my home park here in Lakewood Oakbrook they don't dart and disappear, there is a certain physics that engineered that kind of movement  Andrew.toombs@gmail.com;47.2694;-122.2478
