Observed one blue-green light passing approx South-West.  Observed through bedroom window while watching TV.  Light caught my eye because of color and speed which was aprox 3 times faster than Sea-Tac air traffic which can be seen at same time.   Light appeard to be lower than Income Sea-Tac traffic landing from the south.  Light was steady and did not flicker, maybe half size of quarter at arms length.   View object under 5 seconds before object passed above ridge line of Kent Valley.    checked clock for time which read 21:24;47.2694;-122.2478
