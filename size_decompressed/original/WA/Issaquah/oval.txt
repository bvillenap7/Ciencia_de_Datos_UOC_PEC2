Last night there was a very bright light in the sky over Issaquah WA, it was a very clear sky.  I got out binoculars and checked it out.  It had a red light at the bottom of the object that blinked.  So, I thought it was an airplane.  It didn’t move.  I watched it for a long time, over 10 minutes.  It didn’t move, so watching it with my binoculars it sent out red lights along the edge of the craft like a car with tail lights moving in one direction.  So, I thought it might be a satellite.   When it sent out the red lights in a row like I said, I got creeped out and went to bed, thinking it must be a satellite.
