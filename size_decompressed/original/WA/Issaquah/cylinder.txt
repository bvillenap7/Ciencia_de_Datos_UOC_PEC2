An unidentified round circular object seen with very bright lights--observed for 1 hour.;2012-03-18 22:30:00;1 hour;An unidentified round circular object seen with very bright lights--observed for 1 hour. laying in bed about 10:30 pm .Staring out my big window at clear sky. Notice an extremely bright star with multi colors above a tree.  Ten times brighter than any other visible star. It is stationary as I am staring at it for about 20 minutes.  I commented to my wife to look at this bright multi colored star and I grab my binoculars.  All of a sudden it starts moving slowly across the horizon, left to right---slowly. Then it stopped again and remained stable.  Now my wife and I are taking turns staring at this round object ( it was that close) that had no wings but was covered in red, blue, white green and yellow lights that were very bright.  All of a sudden it moves more rapidly left to right for about 19 seconds---then turns rapidly and moves right to left.  Then again left to right and again right to left.  Then right again very quickly...dissapears.  My wife and I were taking turns looking thru my binoculars the whole time---which lasted for abour 1 hour. This! was obviously not a star. It was not a plane--no wings--- nor was it a helicopter---- no sound. The lights were very bright and looked like they were moving or turning in a circle.We both had never seen any thing like it.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
