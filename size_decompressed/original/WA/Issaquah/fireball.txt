green ball of light falling East of Issaquah.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2004-08-18 21:20:00;1-2 seconds;green ball of light falling East of Issaquah. I was driving on I-90 (East bound- right before the first Issaquah exit)and saw a green light or lit-up green object appear suddenly and fall quickly and then disappear.  The edges of it were fuzzy- not crisp.  It looked to be past Tiger Mountain- maybe in the North Bend area.  It was over quick.  I think that the driver in front of me saw it as well, because he/she put his brakes on for a second right after it happened. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports about the same incident.  PD));47.5196;-122.005105882353
Bright green 'fireball' with distinct tail traveling southbound from I-90 and Highway 18;2007-03-16 21:35:00;less than 30 seconds;Bright green 'fireball' with distinct tail traveling southbound from I-90 and Highway 18 I was traveling westbound on I-90 just cresting the area of Snoqualmie Ridge where I90 intersects Highway 18 turnoff. As I was passing the truck turnout area, I couldn't help but notice a large bright green fireball with a significant tail, traveling just over the tree tops traveling from the north. It appeared the object should have crashed just south of I-90, judging by the angle and the height when it passed over I90. Unfortunately, I could not stop on the shoulder of the roadway due to other cars in the immediate left lane, but I did slow down to watch the object as long as I could. I plan on going back to this area during daylight hours to hike through this area, where I have bowhunted in the past. Hopefully, others will post their observations on this fireball. As a final note, I'd like to add that this 'fireball' was bright green and was much too large to be a pyrotechnic device of any type I have ever seen.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Fire Ball seen over lake sammamish;2008-10-27 02:30:00;A few Seconds;Fire Ball seen over lake sammamish I saw a triangular object falling toward the ground over lake sammamish.  From my view point it was about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It seemed to be coming from the west arching downward.  I would disregard it as a shooting star, but its was very bright and very large for a shooting star.  It was large enough to recognize that it seemed to have a triangular shape.  It was a blueish white color. The light from the object faded as it fell, until it simply disappeared.   During high school I was an amateur astronomer. I've seen many shooting stars some of them quite bright.  But I have never seen anything like this before.

Fireball seen over Seattle.;2012-07-04 22:33:00;2 minutes;Fireball seen over Seattle. We were watching fireworks, then we went home and when we were heading home I looked out of the window and saw a fireball type object.  So when I ran inside to get my camera, I came out and it was gone.  One of the witnesses saw it disappear into the night sky.  Then, I took a look at my satellite app and found that none were in the area;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Two controlled fireballs over lake sammamIsh;2012-08-24 22:00:00;10 minutes;Two controlled fireballs over lake sammamIsh Last night I was driving on east lake sammamish road.   Around 10pm I saw two large fire balls in the sky.  They were about 2 times the size of a plane relatively speaking.  They had a smaller red light in the center and moved towards each other in the sky.  I pulled over to witness this event and watched the lights dIsappear.  Only to reappear closer and right above the road.(about 4 times size of plane, at which point I fled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
