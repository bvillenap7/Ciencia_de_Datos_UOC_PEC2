strange dissapearing objects over lake sammamish.;2007-08-12 20:00:00;25 minutes;strange dissapearing objects over lake sammamish. We were driving east on interstate 90 right before you get into Issaquah when my wife noticed 4 black in color egg shaped  objects in the sky over lake Sammamish. I could not see them at first because I was driving but the urgency in my wifes voice  prompted me to get a view at what she was seeing. I turned around and did see what she had been witnessing. There was 4 objects hovering in the sky maybe 300 feet above the lake. In an instance before our eyes,  three of objects disappeared and then re-appeared around a mile west and where now in different formation. I have lived in the area all my life and have never seen any balloons  over the lake which did cross my mind but balloons donâ€™t dissapear and that could be the only reasonable explination available. I am a marine corps veteran and also a aviation mechanic. I have over 6 years in the field and have seen every type of military craft several times. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be a quite credible witness.  He is former military.  PD));47.5196;-122.005105882353
