Traveling, silent bright blue lights flashing/lighting up the sky.;2012-05-17 21:48:00;15-30 seconds;Traveling, silent bright blue lights flashing/lighting up the sky. I observed three or so flashes of bright blue light, lighting up the night sky. My window and blinds were open, and it was completely silent.  This was not lightning. I would compare the flashes to the shutter of a flash on a camera, except several times.  After three or so flashes, the sky was pitch black again. Whatever it was that was flashing traveled south (?) and flashed again several times, still blue and silent before stopping and traveled outside of the field of vision that my window provides.  I was texting my friend at that time, and noticed that my phone had frozen and restarted itself because I received a text right as it happened.  When I went to read it, the phone froze and would not restart/work until after the flashing lights were gone.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Stationary white light appeared got brighter, moved in a J shape, then disappeared.;2014-11-15 00:00:00;10 seconds;Stationary white light apeared got brighter, moved in a J shape, then disappeared. I was out walking the dog recently and I was looking up about 45 degree and to the south.  I saw what looked a star appear at first I thought it was my imagination that it just appeared.  It was quite bright so it caught and held my attention.  After watching it for several seconds it rapidly moved in a path resembling a J, this happened very fast and as it moved it became brighter.  At the point where it finished the half circle at the bottom of the J shape it flashed even brighter and dissipated.  End of sighting.   Has anyone else seen this kind of thing?
