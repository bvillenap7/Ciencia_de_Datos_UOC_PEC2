We first saw the craft when it was about 5 miles away, coming toward us up May Valley. It made a left 45 degree turn and went between Tiger Mtn and Squak Mtn. It was about 300 feet off the ground and moving at a medium speed. When it reached the ridge of Middle Tiger Mtn, it accelerated and went up and over the mountain and out of our sight. It came as close as 1 mile away.  The craft was 45o - 600 feet long, two levels about 4o feet high. It a appeared that the two sections were connected, however we could not see a solid connection, in fact the craft appeared to be transparent. There were 100's of small lights and 3 or 4 very bright, changing lights which seemed to be the propulsion. There was no sound from the craft.  The media reported that it was a meteor shower, or some space junk falling to earth. There was a video of the craft taken in North Bend (about 10 miles from where we sighted it) at about 9:20.  We also observed two unmarked helicopters following about 5 miles behind the craft. One helicopter was black, the other was grey.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
2 objects, irregularly-shaped, both with something extending in a straight line beneath them, quite high in the sky.;2001-06-21 21:00:00;10 minutes;2 objects, irregularly-shaped, both with something extending in a straight line beneath them, quite high in the sky. At first appeared to be 2 jets, traveling at a duplicate speed on a parallel path, quite high in the sky. However, with the aid of binoculars, they were observed as being two unidentifiable objects, both with something hanging from beneath them in a straight line perhaps metal.  However, both shapes changed frequently.  They were black and were headed in a northerly direction.  We lost sight of the first when it rapidly disappeared the second we were able to track for the remaining time until it rose too high into the atmosphere to see. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found the person to be seemingly quite credible.  Even the witness was uncertain as to what was witnessed, but we requested a brief report, nevertheless.  PD));47.5196;-122.005105882353
flying object  viewded from I-90 westbound near Issaquah, Wa. around 4:00am March 21st, 2010;2010-03-21 04:00:00;15 to 20 seconds;flying object  viewded from I-90 westbound near Issaquah, Wa. around 4:00am March 21st, 2010 Myself and my friend were driving back from Ellensburg, Wa. to Seattle.  The date was March.21st, 2010. I believe the time was about 4:00am. We were headed west on I-90, just coming down the hill into the valley on I-90 near Issaquah, Wa. My friend, who was riding in the passenger seat, said,   What the hell is that?   When he said that, out of the corner of my right eye, I saw something dive down out of the clouds.  What I saw and my friend said he saw were two different things. What I remember seeing, was a long, maybe 20ft. in length, and ten feet in width, flying object. I was going about 60 miles per hour, and the object after diving down out of the clouds, leveled off and seemed to be going faster than we were driving. I could see the outline of the object, but the middle of the object seemed to be translucent. While trying to drive and look up at this object, the object, even though flying straight, seemed to turn and look towards us. I remember I saw what I can only describe as two eyes, that were about the size of can of pop in circumference, and bright blue, look back towards us. Whatever I saw, then flew back up into the clouds.  I believe the cloud cover was not too high that night. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be both sincere, and sober-minded.  PD));47.5196;-122.005105882353

Red glowing UFO about South side of Squak mountain in Issaquah WA;2013-06-15 23:30:00;2 minutes;Red glowing UFO about South side of Squak mountain in Issaquah WA The UFO was viewed at a 45 degree angle, and it was about 80 feet high. A large tree obscured the view.  The UFO was shaped like the bottom half of the fat end of an egg, and it was flat on the top.  It was bright red, cast a red glow, and left a shimmering rainbow color on the grass and trees.  The effect was like a mirage.  There was no sound.  The UFO was stationary when first viewed, then it moved from south to north. It disappeared like a light going out.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
My Sighting of a Flying Dragon in Issaquah, Washington.;2019-09-03 18:00:00;30 minutes;My Sighting of a Flying Dragon in Issaquah Washington USA Dragon Sighting Issaquah, Washington, U.S.A. September 3, 2019 Between 6:00 - 6:30 PM  I was sitting on a park bench in North Issaquah Highland Community in a small park named “Leed Park”.  It sits directly on the north side of a “Marshalls Department Store” .  I’m sitting on one the two benches facing South.  My view is looking dead at the wall of the department store to the front, and there’s a small little forest of trees behind me.  I’m in the farmost eastern bench because I can see the southern sky above the building. I’m gazing up at the sky and I barely see way off in the distance a couple of parachutes. From where I was to where they are was about 2–3 miles away, but still in my site.  In fact, if I were to walk 50 feet to the left, I could see all the parachutes flying from my vantage point.  The actual parachuters appeared like little black dots with a colored parachutes on top of them from where I stood. As I looked at the parachutes, I noticed above them was a darker and bigger black dot.  It was above them a couple thousand feet or so.  It had wings.  It was flying in a giant circular motion like an eagle but it was flying upwards.  This was no Eagle, I thought.  It was flying in a vortex going upward.  I couldn’t believe it.  It would flap it wings looking like it was climbing in a struggle.  Like a giant sloppy bat.  This was very scary to see.  It was directly over the parachuters.  I’m watching it ascend even in greater heights.  The wing span was at least twice as large of that of the parrachuters.  I couldn’t believe my eyes.  I watched it disappear into a black flat bottom cloud.  I could still see the parrachuters but this creature went into this cloud that was coming approximately in my direction.  I followed this cloud for about 30 minutes just trying to see if it would pop out somewhere.  It was up there somewhere.  This creature was gigantic in size. All I could do was call the parachute company the next morning.  I told the owner everything I had seen.  He was very polite. The location where they parachute is called “Poo Poo” Point.  My sighting happened directly over the hot spot flying area.  Which is full of flyers.  You can see where I was on Google Map, and you can see where Poo Poo point is.;47.5196;-122.005105882353

The lights seemed to be long in shape and going down words. I watched them for 5 minutes before they disappeared behind trees. Didn't seem to be UFO's but more like slow moving long lights. This area is popular for parasailing but not in the middle of the night AKA Tiger Mountain area. I would estimate they were 6 miles away from my location.  ;47.5196;-122.005105882353
