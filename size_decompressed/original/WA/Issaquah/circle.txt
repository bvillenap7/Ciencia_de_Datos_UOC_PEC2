Fast moving ball of light.;2005-07-17 10:00:00;30 Sec;Fast moving ball of light. While looking up during a building inspection, I saw a ball or circle, similar in appearance and size to a space shuttle reentry I saw several years ago in Vancouver BC. I saw it for about 20 to 30 seconds in which time it traversed the diameter of about 4 full moons. I was looking nearly straight up, and it went behind the building I was looking at. It was traveling from west to east.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Blue and orange object in the sky;2005-09-02 02:20:00;5 seconds;Blue and orange object in the sky We were driving home on I-90 going west and had just passed the Issaquah/Hobart exit.  It was a black ring with blue flame (it was not flame, it looked a little like fumes or gas maybe) around the front that became orange in the back. The orange color made a long tail or trail behind the object. The trail was a perfect straight line.  My wife and I have seen falling stars before, this was NOT a falling star.  It did appear to be moving downward or maybe falling.  I have never seen a meteor falling to earth, but I cannot imagine a meteor having that blue color. I also would find it hard to believe a metoer trail would be perfectly straight.  I was hoping someone else saw this.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
White orbs in the clouds, both as big as a two story house, seen near Issaquah, Wa. on I-90, March 21st, 2010;2010-03-21 04:00:00;5 to 10 seconds;White orbs in the clouds, both as big as a two story house, seen near Issaquah, Wa. on I-90, March 21st, 2010 I was riding in the passenger seat of a vehicle that my friend was driving.  It was about 4:00am or so, on Mar. 21st, 2010.  We were coming back from Ellensburg, Wa., headed towards Seattle. We were dropping down into the valley, near Issaquah, Wa., on I-90, headed west.  I saw two big white glowing orbs in the clouds.  And then they dove down out of the clouds, and disappeared after about 5 to ten seconds. My best guesstimate as to how big the orbs were, were that each of them were probably as big as a two story house.;47.5196;-122.005105882353

White reflective sphere about the size of a star seen in the daylight hours;2021-08-28 17:45:00;>10 minutes;White reflective sphere about the size of a star seen in the daylight hours There is a white circular object that looks the size of a planet or star but the sun has not set yet. It seems to be higher than the airplanes flying around. One thought is it could be a weather balloon, but not sure what those would look like.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
