I was working on the back side of the barn when I heard a jet flying over. I always look up because jets fly out of Seattle-Tacoma Intntl Airport right over the farm. This jet was making the typical 747 rumble in the sky so I looked up. It was heading SE. suddenly I noticed the a bright object was flying high in the sky to the left of the 747. The object flew over the top of the 747. The object was much higher then the 747 which I figure at 4-5 thousand feet. This object was at least 20 thousand feet or higher. The object left on contrail but other jets in the sky at high altitude were. The object was heading toward the sun so I soon lost sight of it. One other thing, as it flew forward it looked like the object skipping left and right of a straight line. The shape of the object was elongated arrow shaped. Color- It was reflecting the sun light. I couldn't hear any noise because of the jet. This sighting lasted less then 2 minutes. The object was fly at a very high speed for the altitude it was at.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
green red and white objects in the sky in Issaquah;2002-02-24 23:00:00;4hours;green red and white objects in the sky in Issaquah the lights were christmas green or blue and flashes of red with a white or golden triangle surrounding the circular colors.  The objects were sitting alone along with the stars and sometimes appeared as a green star.  Some of the objects were slowly moving and others just dissapeared.  The one I concentrated on was always moving slowly in a small area and then shot into the air until I could no longer see it.  I did see aircraft which seemed to be close and in the area.  These objects when they did move it was at a rapid speed.  I have never spotted anything like this and at first It reminded me of aChristmas ornament.

I am a;2003-08-15 23:15:00;6 seconds;I did not report this and have been looking for information to see if anyone has seen a similar object. I do not want notarity. I am a 57 year old professional engineer and after years of looking at the night sky I have never before seen anything that I would describe as a ufo or any other object similar to what I saw up close in August. I do not remember the exact date, but it was an unusually clear and moonless night. We live in the foothills east of Seattle in an area sheltered from city light. I went out in the yard and was laying on a blanket watching for meteorites during a period of expected meteor showers. It was quiet except for the sounds of owls in the woods. After about half an hour I noticed something approaching very fast, very low and blocking out the stars to the east in my peripheral vision. As I looked upward, a large boom-a rang shaped object passed overhead at an altitude I would estimate as 500 to 1000 feet. It had no lights, absolutely no sound and seemed to be traveling at a supersonic speed without any accompanying sonic boom. I remember saying out loud What the... at which time a cargo bay or some opening on the bottom center of the object lit up with a blueish white light. I could see visible framework in the rounded front, rectangular opening. Just as quickly, the light went out. It had lit up for perhaps three seconds. Within two more seconds the object disappeared over the foothills to the west. It had passed from horizon to horizon in perhaps six seconds. Again it was extremely low, had no navagation lights and absolutely no sound. We have jet aircraft pass over our home in the day. NOTHING travels as fast as what I saw that night. My own wife scoffs at my story and says it must have been a meteor. It wasn't. I have not and do not intend to tell this story to anyone else.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
The Seattle/Issaquah object keeps coming at around 7:05-7:20 and I've seen it 3 times in the last week.  ((anonymous report));2017-01-09 07:05:00;~4 minutes;The Seattle/ Issaquah object keeps coming at around 7:05-7:20 and I've seen it 3 times in the last week. I was driving I-90 west again, but I noticed the object before I got off the exit.  As I was driving, in the corner of my eye, I saw a bright light speeding in a half circle, like it was changing directions.  I automatically looked out my window and noticed that it was much closer to the ground almost as far down as an airplane would go.  The object looked like a hollow triangle with circle like bulbs on each point with bright yellow lights that alternated from yellow to red to stark white.  The object was heading towards Issaquah, Washington and it went out of my vision really fast.   After seeing that I was telling myself, Okay, maybe i'm just tired but when I got off exit 11 and when I was waiting for the stop light to turn green I saw the object speed back into my sight and then stopped.  Now this confirmed that I wasn't just tired because there is no way that an airplane could turn around that fast and just stop moving unless the pilot was on crack. Wh! en the light turned green and I took my left turn the object started to move again at a steady pace toward Seattle, Washington (opposite direction of Issaquah).   I decided to follow the object but it kept moving in random directions and I had to get to class so I turned my car around but when I looked in my rear view mirror the object was gone.  Whatever this is, I keep seeing it at around 7:05-7:20am randomly heading from Seattle going into the Issaquah area.  January 11, 2017, I saw it again while I was driving into school and couldn't get my phone out fast enough to capture a picture.
