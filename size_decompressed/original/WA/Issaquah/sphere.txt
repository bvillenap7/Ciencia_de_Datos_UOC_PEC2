White solid sphere hovering above the trees in WA state;2018-03-03 15:09:00;60 seconds;White solid sphere hovering above the trees in WA state We were driving down I-90 eastbound through Issaquah.  We noticed many paragliders near the mountain so we were looking up.  Then my mom pointed out a completely static sphere hovering above the trees. It was white.  It was smaller than the paragliders and below them.  I watched for about 30 seconds before I was able to get my phone out to record. It did not move at all.  I'm sure the paragliders must have seen it, as it was just below them.  We rounded the hill and could no longer see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Video provided by witness shows a very small image of a light-colored object in the norther sky.  We are unable to make a positive identification of the object.
