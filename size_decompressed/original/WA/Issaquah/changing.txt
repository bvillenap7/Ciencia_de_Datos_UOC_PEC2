Standing in my living room,we have a panaramic view of Seattle and the Olympic Mountains, I observed the following:  A cloud that started and was very large and it seemed to disapate at a rapid rate. The cloud would reappear and then seem to transform into smaller clouds' and move in various directions. There were no other clouds in the horizen at that time. I was speaking to my Son and asked him to look...teenager talking to his girlfriend and he caught a glimpse a few times but was involoved in his conversation.  There were small cloud like visuals that continued over the next one hour and fifteen minutes..that minimized and became large again several times over this period. They traveledup and down, sideways, growing larger and smaller and reabsorbing.  There were no other distractions in the sky at this time.  I am having a difficult time describing the full impact of what I saw....these were not clouds....  There were no lights just the movement of the cloud and what has been described.  I left the room several times and returnded to find it still occuring.  I am a highly responsible individual that would have no desire to make a claim that would be unfounded.  I will mention that I was witness to a UFO sighting in 1978 that was recorded by your organinization  with docmented follow up.  I would welcome your inquiry.

It was covered in small bright red colored lights.  Floating quickly.  It was visible for 11 seconds and quickly disappeared.  It made no noise.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
