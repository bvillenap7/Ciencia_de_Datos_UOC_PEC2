Two very bright stars briefly appeared in the southern sky;2006-06-12 01:55:00;:01;Two very bright stars briefly appeared in the southern sky In the south sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon, a pair of stars appeared that faded to full brightness. Brighter than any other stars.  After less than a minute, they faded away.  First one, then the other. The stars were arranged vertically, about the same distance apart as two stars in the big dipper appear to be apart.  It was sort of like seeing satellites, except that they didn't appear to move at all and there was a pair.  They became bright and faded away all without moving.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Blue-white light with lights attached or following made complete u-turn at slow steady speed.;2008-01-18 18:50:00;3min;Blue-white light with lights attached or following made complete u-turn at slow steady speed. At approximately 18:50hrs this evening, I was walking my dogs and going in an easterly direction.  In the SouthEast, I looked up at the moon.  The moon was to the right of the object, about two hands away.  I saw what at first appeared to be a satellite moving toward the south.  It moved for a few seconds, and then I could make out something directly behind it that was dimmer and seemed to be attached to it.  I am an amatuer astronomer, and have spent many nights watching satellites passing by.  What piqued my curiosity was that this object made a complete turn, and after a few seconds made a u-turn in the opposite direction.  The more I watched it, I was able to make out some detail, even though it was a small white-blue point of light with something attached to its rear.  For a second it seemed that there were four or five much smaller white lights surrounding it as well.  Then I lost sight of it because there was a few whisps of clouds that eventually obscured it.  Time interval was roughly one minute.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
satellite-like in brightness, slow and changing direction, no contrail, heading first WSW then W.;2008-08-23 08:55:00;4 minutes;satellite-like in brightness, slow and changing direction, no contrail, heading first WSW then W. I was enjoying my morning coffee on my porch, facing east.  There was a thin, high band of clouds somewhat obscuring the sun, and I noticed a 'rainbow effect' by the disc of the sun, presumably due to ice crystals in the clouds.  I then noticed, about 50-55 degrees above the eastern horizon, what looked like a satellite, moving toward WSW in a slow, somewhat halting fashion. After about a minute it seemed to change course to due west. It did not increase or decrease in brightness, as a tumbling satellite reflecting sunlight would. Also, the sun was behind it.  I could not determine altitude using the clouds as a guide, because the object was away from the clouds, but it looked to be much higher than a normal aircraft.  There was no contrail or sound. I wish to emphasize that the object looked very much like a satellite that you see after sundown would.  I watched, craning my neck as far as possible until I had to get up and walk on the gravel driveway (in barefeet-ouch!) I took my eyes of the object for just a second, but could not find it again.  It would have been directly over my house.  I went inside, and it was exactly 0900 hours.  As a sidenote, my Dad was an aeronautical engineer for Boeing,  and I know a plane when I see one.  I am also an amateur astronomer, and this may well have been the ISS space station or a satellite of some sort, but the fact that it changed direction, was slow and halting and so bright makes me scratch my head and wonder what it was.  If I had to guess, I would say the object was round or slightly oblong. Also, I was wearing sunglasses.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Golden light seen Issaquah WA;2009-06-26 03:10:00;10 seconds;Golden light seen Issaquah WA I was standing on my back porch, and I saw a gold colored light traveling roughly in a Northerly direction, in a straight line.  I have seen identical objects over the last two years twice before.  It was not a flare from a satellite, because it was a steady glow which did not diminish.  I saw it make its way rather slowly at a steady speed and it disappeared in the clouds.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Light flashing and changing colors.;2012-02-27 00:36:00;5 min;Light flashing and changing colors. At 12:36 AM I was observing the Virgo group of galaxies in the South Eastern sky.  I observed in the Northeastern sky a light which appeared to be flashing in a strange rhythm.  With each flash it was changing colors from white to yellow to red.  It floated around slowly, and after a few minutes disappeared.  Two witnesses.  It appeared to be above Tiger Mountain in Issaquah. King County WA State.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Light traveling in semi-circular path changing color and shedding particles.;2012-08-03 23:04:00;1min;Light traveling in semi-circular path changing color and shedding particles. I was standing in the courtyard of my apartment complex looking toward the South, when I noticed a white light traveling slowly in an uneven semi-circular path from about the area of constellation Cygnus toward the North-West.   The object dimmed and then glowed a brighter orange for a few seconds.  Tiny particles were coming off of it for another few seconds, then it changed back to white and faded away.  Time interval was 1 minute.   Didn't travel in a regular orbit.  No sound whatever.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Saw orange light move erratically in the night sky.;2014-07-04 22:25:00;3 minutes;Saw orange light move erratically in the night sky I saw a bright orange light appear suddenly in the night sky while watching fireworks.  At first I thought it was a firework or an airplane, but it moved oddly.   It moved gradually upward in the night sky and at one point it got very bright.   It then moved to the right and then it moved erratically some more.  I called my mom over to see its erratic movements.  It faded out and then came back, and then faded out completely.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Small, steady point of light made an impossible maneuver;2016-07-24 02:50:00;90 seconds;small steady point of light made an impossible maneuver I witnessed a distant point of weak light with binoculars, roughly toward the West.  It moved in a straight line, appearing to descend, then made a crazy round turn to the North which made no sense, then vanished.  No aircraft could ever perform this maneuver.   It was moving at an incredible speed.  No sound emitted.   I am an Army vet, experienced in astronomy, military aircraft with a scientific background.  It was not a satellite. There didn't appear to be any flare.;47.5196;-122.005105882353

I saw a bright green light shoot across the sky, from north to south.  It was bright green and circular in shape.   It moved fast but not quite as fast as a shooting star.  It also had no visible tracer or trail behind it. It lasted just a few seconds before it disappeared behind some mountains.   Did anyone else see this???  Possible meteor? ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, The object was traveling slightly more in the south east direction.  Hard to tell as I was rounding a curve on the freeway.  This object seemed to be larger than the size of a star in the night sky, but much smaller than the size of the moon.  The object was also about the altitude of a aircraft (or higher) as it flew out over the cascades and disappeared out of my sight.  It didn't seem to be ascending or descending but more of a straight level path across the sky.  It also had no fragments tailing behind. It was almost an orb type ball of light.  It left no visible trailings or tracers behind it.  It did not appear to be a fire ball, as to what most people report as meteors.  It didn't seem to fizzle out or burn up.  It simply just flew out of my view when it went past the foot hills.  Seemed very odd and gave me an uneasy feeling, along with goosebumps.   I hope this helps describe the event.  I am happy to answer any other questions you may have.  Thank you, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));47.5196;-122.005105882353
Strange 'headlights' in very early morning hours traveling east on Interstate I-90 and east of Issaquah, WA;2018-03-11 04:15:00;Several seconds;Strange 'headlights' in very early morning hours traveling east on Interstate I-90 and east of Issaquah, WA. A friend and I were returning home to the North Bend area around 4:15am, on March 11th. We were traveling eastbound on I-90, enjoying the drive with almost no traffic going eastbound. We had just passed the exit for Preston, and headed down the grade and were traveling up the rather long uphill grade of I-90, traveling in the number 3 lane. I had the cruise control on 70mph, as I almost always do when there is little or no traffic. I am a former County and Federal law enforcement officer and always cognizant of other vehicles in my vicinity of travel.  I check my rear view mirror very often for approaching traffic. There were no vehicles traveling eastbound from the time we passed through Issaquah and onto this stretch of I-90. Approximately half way up this rather long grade of I-90, and before exit #25, that exits onto I-18, I glanced in my rear view mirror and was shocked to see what appeared to be two rectangular headlights right on our tail.  I assumed this was a motor vehicle, and there was no noise. I quickly glanced to my right side mirror to make sure no other vehicles were approaching, and was planning on making a quick lane change to get out of the way of this vehicle, then quickly glanced in the rear view mirror, and the lights were gone. This happened so quickly, that I did not change lanes, but we did immediately slow down so I could look behind us to see if a vehicle had swerved off of the freeway on either side. There were no taillights or headlights that I could see on either side of the highway behind us. My passenger and I talked about this, and what had just happened, and I was in bewilderment.  I tried to reason things out as to what had just occurred.  Something in my mind was telling me that something else besides just the 'headlights' was strange, but I could not put my finger on it. Roughly 3 or so minutes later, while still traveling, I got a pounding headache in the center of my head, and this continued well into the following day, even after taking several Aleve tablets. The next day, this incident continued playing through my head, and this is when I realized that the headlights were not only rectangular in shape, but they did NOT emit a forward shining beam, that headlights are designed to do.  Both of these 'headlights' were just lights and did not actually shine into my rear view mirror, but were bright nonetheless, and the rectangular shape of both lights were defined in their shape. I have no explanation of what these lights were, and neither did my passenger. Two days later, I traveled this major highway into Bellevue, and on the way home to North Bend, I carefully checked out both sides of I-90 in the area of this incident to see if there was any indication of a vehicle going off the roadway, there was none. Just a little bit about my background, I was enlisted in the Air Force, and obtained my Commercial pilot license and instrument/seaplane ratings.  I have over 3600 hours in fixed wing aircraft. Rather than pursuing a career in aviation as a young adult, I chose law enforcement, where I worked with the County, as well as a Federal law enforcement agency. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and found him to be both eloquent, and convincing.  His credentials as a law enforcement officer, as well as an experienced commercial pilot, speak for themselves, we believe.  PD));47.5196;-122.005105882353
Two bright lights near the moon that were stationary and slowly faded out;2018-11-19 18:20:00;45 seconds;Two bright lights near the moon that were stationary and slowly faded out Clear night, 3/4 moon.  I was exiting my car with a load of groceries and looked up at the moon.  Approx. 12 degrees east of the moon were two bright lights, about 2 degrees apart. My first thought was satellites, but they did not appear to be moving (or if they were, they were very slow).  I witnessed this for about twenty seconds before I put my bags down to get my phone out to take a picture.  At this point the lights both  began to fade, and 10 seconds later they were gone. I have been an avid star watcher for decades and  I was confused because  1.  They were not stars of any constellation in that part of the sky,  2.  The lights were if equal brightness and size, and  3.  Although they appeared at first to be satellites, they were stationary.   I am aware of the north/south path of most satellites, and how they can become brighter and fade as they shine in and out of the sun, but this was not the case. I'm reporting this because I sincerely don’t know what I saw, and maybe someone else saw it as well.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
Slow moving white light going over.my building;2020-03-09 06:40:00;2.5 minutes;Slow moving white light going over.my building At 6:40 am I took the dog out.  I saw behind my building a white light rising in the sky.  It was moving toward the Northeast, slowly and in an irregular fashion.  It was much lower than a plane, made no noise and was a steady white light.  I have seen drones it didn't look like one I have seen and I wonder why it would have such a bright light.  I have three videos of this.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
