I was in treatment up in the mountains. around Issaquah and Renton area, we could step out and smoke I stepped out and smoke a cigarette at around 1:32 in the morning, I looked up in the sky. and I seen lights, just flashing this glowing it was about 4 or5  next thing I know they took off like I don't know what.. in all kind of directions. And they were gone from that point on I became a Believer in UFOs so help me God.... I never seen nothing like it before in my life.. I'm a Believer I don't know what they are I just know what I saw man couldn't have done that I haven't told too many people my wife I want  my mother cuz she thinks im  crazy there's no way to explain what I saw I'm trying I think that the UFOs are  angels is this just my thought who made man I'm quite sure whoever made man can make a ship! .  what I saw that night I will never forget it never.  I don't know if it's God and His angels are somehow in their technology but what I saw was real...... and  they take off like lightning lightning I have since move back home what brought this to my attention are these latest sightings. what I saw was real.

Helicopter following 2 black holes in sky.;2014-12-02 20:50:00;1 minute;Helicopter following 2 black holes in sky. Night.  Clear conditions.  A very loud helicopter with red and green running lights following close behind 2 very dark shapes about 200 feet off the ground.  The dark shapes looked so black as to be holes in the sky.   My guess is the 2 dark shapes were a type of stealth helicopter, which would explain how loud the identifiable helicopter seemed to be.  The dark shapes  could have been the profile of sophisticated military helicopters.  Never seen anything like that, though.   The blackness of the shapes was unnerving. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  PD));47.5196;-122.005105882353
