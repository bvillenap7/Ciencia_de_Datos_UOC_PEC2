Issaquah, WA sighting - summer 1969;1969-07-01 16:00:00;1 minute;Issaquah, WA sighting - summer 1969 It was summertime, approx. 1969 - I was 9 years old.  Me and two of my friends were were at the swimming pool in our apartments at approx. 4:00pm. A silver, not shiny, disc/saucer shaped object, very large with what appeared to be some lights flew over head.  It was going slow enough that we could tell what it was - maybe 30 MPH.  It is hard to judge the distance of height in the air - much much lower than a small airplane would fly.  I remember feeling stunned, and not quite believing what just happened.  It went towards Cougar Mountain in Issaquah.  We told my friend's older brother about it - he and a friend went up on an old dirt logging road the next day and found a spot where the brush/grass had been flattened in a large circular area. I have wondered all these years if anyone else experienced this sighting in Issaquah or the Seattle area.  No one really wanted to believe us back then - who believes a 9 year old who says she's seen a UFO? I have always believed in other life out there because of this sighting and I know it's just a matter of time before the truth becomes known to this world.

I was sleeping on the couch in the living room with my mother.  I woke up late at night, stood up in the room, and saw a bluish silvery object cross the sky through our front window.  It looked like a smallish teacup resting upside down on top of two saucers resting face to face I do not remember anything but watching it cross the sky from left to right.  It took a medium amount of time to cross the sky line but I get the feeling I watched it longer than that somehow.  It remains one of my clearest memories from my childhood. I have a very good memory but this one is extra sharp! ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates no date for the incident.  We have assigned an arbitrary date and time until we can obtain an estimated date.  We do not know how old the witness is, so we can only estimate the date from the nature of her profession.

4 craft with red & white lights hovering over Lake Sammamish, WA.;2005-02-07 06:00:00;10 min;4 craft with red & white lights hovering over Lake Sammamish, WA. As I was driving Northward towards Lake Sammamish, I saw 4 crafts with red and white lights hovering over Lake Sammamish.  For a long time they did not move at all.  I thought they must be helicopters but I hav never seen helicopters with lights like that.  There were about 3 red lights in a row and a white light that flashed.  I cannot account for them other than to think they were UFOS.;47.5196;-122.005105882353
