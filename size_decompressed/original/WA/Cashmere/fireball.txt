Green orb flew over Dawn Lee Court in Cashmere;2003-08-14 20:00:00;10 seconds;Green orb flew over Dawn Lee Court in Cashmere I was sitting in my den watching a movie about 8 at night.  It was dark outside so I turned my head when I saw a flash of light outside my window to my left.  I turned my head and saw a bright green ball of light (same color and look of a green glow tube) that appeared to be about the size of a basketball. It flew over the eve of my house (I estimate about 15-25 feet off the ground), dipped down between my house and my neighbors, and skimmed over the top of their roof.  I estimate it was traveling about 20-30 miles per hour.  I was fully awake at the time and I watched it intently until it went behind my neighbor's house.;47.522;-120.5124
