Hugh black object(s) in sky;2001-12-29 16:30:00;6 to 10 minutes;Hugh black object(s) in sky My husband and I were outside at about 16:30 on 12/29/01, overcast conditions (although a pretty thin cloud cover).  We witnessed an object which appeared quite large in the sky above us.  It was hard to see a shape, it seemed to be moving in and out of the cloud cover, or changing shape.  It was black and had no visible lights.  This lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  Then about 1 minute later, we saw a black, disc-shaped object fall like a leaf out of the sky, above some trees approximately 1/2 mile away.  After this was seen, we noticed more movement in the same area of the falling object.  The first thing I thought was, oh, they're hang gliding!  So, it almost looked like 2 objects in the clouds at this point, maybe triangular shaped.  They seemed to be moving playfully, but it was very hard to tell because they (or it) were in and out of the cloud cover like before.  We never noticed the falling object coming back up or actually landing.I was able to watch the movement in the clouds for about 10 seconds then they (or it) disappeared, seemingly flying into heavier cloud cover.These objects or object appeared to be floating or hovering and actually changing shape with the clouds - it's quite hard to describe. There was absolutely no wind, or sound at all.  We thought of kites, hang gliders, planes, weather balloons, none of which seem to fit what we witnessed. We continued to watch the sky for the next 20 minutes, but saw nothing else unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted to MUFON by same witness.  PD));48.086504;-123.588
Flash of light and huge object blending in with the night sky;2006-11-19 22:45:00;1 1/2 min.;Flash of light and huge object blending in with the night sky My husband and I were outside our home. It was a clear night. There was suddenly a bright flash that lit up the whole sky-like lightning, except there were no clouds and no thunder followed. We both looked up in the sky and were searching for the source of the flash, when I saw an object moving slowly in a East-South East direction. To me the object appeared to be see-through, as I could barely tell it was there at first. It seemed to blend in with the dark sky and the stars. But, as it moved there were a few lights on the bottom and I knew I was no longer looking at stars. It was huge (If I hold a ruler 12 from the bridge of my nose, the object would have been at least 4 long x 3 wide.) I asked my husband if he saw it and he said he did. As it moved away from us, it gained in speed and in an instant was gone.  I have waited almost 2 months to report this due to the strange weather we've been having in the area. My husband and I discussed what to do, and we decided to wait and see if it came back. Shortly after this sighting we were struck with a freak snowstorm and internet service was knocked out for 4 days. Then, last month, we had 2 severe wind storms, which we are still dealing with the damage from and again we lost internet service for 5 days.  So, thanks to calm weather this week, I am finally able to report what we saw.;48.086504;-123.588
Shimmering wing shape travelling at 30,000 mph+ and made a 90 degree turn!;2019-06-07 13:00:00;3 seconds;Shimmering wing shape travelling at 30,000 mph+ and made a 90 degree turn! I have spent most of my working life in the outdoors in Forestry.  With four college degrees and being a published author, I’m used to giving accurate, detailed descriptions.  Very analytical.  This is what I saw on June 7, 2019, a Friday.  There are military bases nearby, submarine traffic, shipping lanes, airports in this area.  I’m used to seeing different types of military and civilian aircraft. I was standing on the back deck, with a beautiful, mostly sunny day.  Jet engine noise made me look into the sky, and something caught my eye, coming from the south, moving very fast!  By my calculations, it traveled from directly over my house, to East of Victoria, B.C., in two seconds!  Made a 90-degree turn and headed towards Whidby Island and military installations.  A small cloud obstructed my view of the turn, but there was no veering out to account for inertia in the turn.  That I saw!  There seemed to be a shimmer around what looked like, a wing shape, with no fuselage visible.  The wing shape was slanted back about 15 to 20 degrees, and a shimmer was around the wing, and a straight edge was visible at the end of the wing shape, on both sides.  No fuselage was observable.  The leading edge of the wing appeared dark.  Looked like a flying wing.  And jet engine noise. The estimated distance traveled in two seconds was fifty miles!!!  By my calculations…30,000 to 45,000 mph!!! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  However, we question his assumptions about distance and velocity.  Witness provides hand-drawn image of what the object looked like to him.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to flying wing shimmering and 90 degree turn at speed of:  2 seconds travelling 10 miles Good talking to you, Peter.   The following is my best recollection of what I saw.  10 miles is a reasonable distance for the object to have traveled in two seconds and would be traveling at 18,00mph!.  At 50 miles, that’s still in U.S. territory and 2 seconds would be about 90,000mph.  The background was blue sky when I saw what looked like, a flying wing.  That's what it looked like.  A loud roar like that of a military jet passed over our house.  That's why my wife and I looked up, but I was the only one who saw this object.  Three-seconds and it was gone.  It came from the direction of the Olympic Mountains, (Mt Olympus is 7900ft.) so I think it was descending.  The small cumulus cloud I saw I estimate at 3000ft because 3300ft is the usual lowest altitude for Cumulus clouds, which the object passed through.  No way they were at 10,000ft. Using my clinometer, (I am a trained surveyor and forester, also a Navy veteran).  I calculated a 10-degree upward slope, at 45 degree azimuth, looking at the object. I immediately went inside the house to draw what I had seen. 10 miles out, towards Canada, is where I think it made a 90-degree turn, heading East.   This would coincidentally point it towards military bases in the area. At 10 miles, the calculated speed was 18,000 miles per hour!  (2 seconds and 10 miles away)  Also coincidence, close to escape velocity of 25,000mph.  Slowing down on landing approach?  It was in broad daylight and whatever it was, did not appear to be in trouble or care if anyone saw it. I’m not an artist but this the shape of what I saw and the ‘shimmer’ around the flying object: a boomerang shape with a 15 degree back angle on the wings.  About double the size of the sun, using your thumb as a reference. Like you said Peter, I hope this is ours. ((END ADDENDUM));48.086504;-123.588

A large object bright red w/white lights and three smaller individual objects in SE sky in northwest Washington State across from BC CA;2019-10-25 20:24:00;1-2 minutes;A large object bright red w/white lights and three smaller individual objects in SE sky in northwest Washington State across from BC CA I was driving when at 20:24 PST  I noticed a large bright object in the Southeast sky with a lot of red and also some white light. It was shaped like an upside down right trapezoid or a tweaked sideways parallelogram and as I was wondering satellite or maybe a planet that was really close. I then noticed three smaller lights (2 white/yellow and 1 green) just to the left (east) of the large light. They were too far apart to be a single aircraft and too big to be stars. The smaller ones were kind of blinking when suddenly they each moved separately crazy fast towards the west and then they all completely disappeared???? Poof no sign of them. I only saw it for a minute or two as I was driving towards it so, no idea how long it was there.;48.086504;-123.588
Port Angeles wa 3 objects in sky;2021-07-03 15:40:00;50 minutes;Port Angeles wa 3 objects in sky UFO sighting  On July 3, 2021 at approximately 1540 hrs. while sitting in the backyard of a residence located in Port Angeles Washington, a group of four of us observed three silver in appearance objects high in the sky over Olympic National Park. We retrieved a pair of binoculars to take a closer look. The following is a description of what we observed.  The objects resembled shiny silver doughnuts. Each of the objects were tumbling end over end. One of the objects appeared to have something whitish in color trailing from it, although it was difficult to see given the distance.  The objects were located more or less in a horizontal line in the atmosphere when viewed against the horizon.  We observed the objects approximately 40 minutes.  Through our course of observation, the objects moved north towards Canada.;48.086504;-123.588
