A friend and I were sitting in her backyard watching the stars last night. I was watching the northern sky when at about 11:30 pm, I noticed a fall of stars rapidly dropping down from above in the northern sky. I realized quickly that they were not stars but extremely fast moving lights. My friend then saw them: Four bright lights flying in formation, a straight line. They flew overhead very fast still flying in formation. They were much lower than a normal jet would fly and there was literally no sound. My friend and I jumped out of our chairs and looked up as they flew overhead. We turned around and watched them go South. This took maybe 5 or six seconds and they were out of site that fast. We were both quite rattled. My friend is a former scientist, having been in a UW masters program for chemistry, studying rocket science in a NASA program. I have no science background. We both agreed that this was unusual and couldn't find a logical explaination for what happened.;48.086504;-123.588
