Fast faded star like objects.;2020-08-16 22:30:00;hours;fast faded star like objects They looked like faded stars.  They would appear move extremely fast, change directions at times just stop. They were moving in all directions. some were heading north, south east and west.  We saw basically 1 at a time. At one point we saw one take off and all of the sudden another appeared and went directly behind it.  They flew in straight lines mostly but some would change directions and come to a dead stop. The sightings of them lasted approximately 10-15 seconds or until went under cloud cover.  We noticed about 10:30 at night and quit watching around 1:30 am.  We have observed many meteor showers, shooting stars and a few comets.  Never have we seen anything like this. I am a 53 year old grocery worker.  My boyfriend works construction and his niece is 7 years old.  We are outdoorsmen.  Hunt fish hike and camp.  We have spent many times in our mountains.  This was something neither of us could explain or have experienced.;48.086504;-123.588
