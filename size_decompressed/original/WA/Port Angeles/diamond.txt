Night time sighting, 3 large gold lights on corners, one red light on nose of diamond, couldn't see any body but heard FAINT JET ENGINE;1998-12-18 06:30:00;aprox 10 min;Night time sighting, 3 large gold lights on corners, one red light on nose of diamond, couldn't see any body but heard FAINT JET ENGINE NOISE! I got a good set of binoculars on this thing but still couldn't see any body between the lights. Im almost certain the body was painted black. It was about the size of a large jetliner, The lights were not landing lights or the standard aircraft strobe type lights. The 3 gold lights were much larger than normal aircraft lights and were not aimed in any direction,as landing lights are. Was moving slow as in landing speed. Flew right over our sleeping town ALMOST siently, BUT I HEARD FAINT BUT UNMISTAKABLE JET ENGINE NOISE. Sighting was just after last Gulf war  started. I think this thing is one of ours, stealth bomber maybe? Craft was heading east to west. Don't remember if red light was blinking.;48.086504;-123.588
Brightest light, hovering with humming sound- Port Angeles, WA.;2007-05-23 23:00:00;15 minutes;Brightest light, hovering with humming sound- Port Angeles, WA. Around 11pm I saw the brightest light through my window. It was so glaring, it caught my eye. I looked out my door and there was a diamond shaped light hovering over, moving slightly. It did not light up the sky surronding the object. I woke up my son to be an eye witness and grabbed my video camera and got it on video. I watched it for about ten minutes and it was so bright, it hurt my eyes. There was also a strange very loud humming noise.  I walked away for less than 5 minutes and called my mom and she thought maybe it was Venus. I asked her if stars move, lol. I went back to my porch and it was gone. I could see the tiniest of speckle in the far off sky. Just then I saw a plane approaching the same area the object had been in.  There were no other colored lights on this object, it was not a plane and it was not a helicopter. What was it?

Flashing diamond making short up,down, circular, left, right, movements in dark, clear Northeast night sky;2012-08-11 23:30:00;1 hour;Flashing diamond making short up,down, circular, left, right, movements in dark, clear Northeast night sky We viewed flashing green, white, red lit object in the distance north/northeast of us â€“ witnessed by 2 people - beginning about 11:30 PM 8/11/12.    At first we thought it was a plane moving eastward, but after about 10 minutes we realized it was almost stationary (we were watching the meteor shower in the Northeast sky). As we studied the object instead of the stars, it did circles, went up and down and left to right and right to left several times until we quit watching about 12:30 AM 8/12/12.  Sometimes it was even a bit jittery and movements were not evenly spaced.  Some movements  appeared to be fast and others slow.   It appeared to be about 25-30 degrees off of  the  horizon, slightly over a tree line.;48.086504;-123.588
