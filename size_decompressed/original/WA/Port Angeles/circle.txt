When we went to get the telescope, it started going further and further into outer space.  By the time I had the telescope outside, it was so far into outer space, it was unable to see, even with a telescope;48.086504;-123.588
Moving light, violent explosion.;2015-08-23 22:00:00;30 seconds;Moving light violent explosion. It looked just like the other stars, but was moving faster than a satellite in a straight line from South to Northeast.  No blinking lights.   I kept watching its progress for about 20 seconds when - it exploded!  This was a bright, white light that shot out maybe 200 times larger than the 'star'.   The flash was not uniform in shape, nor was there any 'roundness' to this flash.  It was lopsided with huge, sharp spikes radiating outward.  This flash lasted less than a breath.  The 'star' continued its same path for maybe 3 seconds and then simply disappeared.;48.086504;-123.588
