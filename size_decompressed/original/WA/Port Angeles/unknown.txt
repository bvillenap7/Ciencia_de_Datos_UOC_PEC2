Sighting of a UFO that could not be explained by a physics professor / pilot.;2001-04-01 03:30:00;5 Minutes;Sighting of a UFO that could not be explained by a physics professor/pilot. I stepped outside and noticed a light in the sky.  After a couple of moments it began to move (at a normal rate of speed).  I didn't really think anything of it.  When it crossed the horizon of the opposing mountain range (about 5 miles away, 3-5000ft) it caught my attention and I began watching it closely. During a period of about five minutes, I watched the object cover vast areas (several miles), several times over, in the blink of an eye.  The object would move, stop on a dime, and immediately change directions with angles nearly as sharp as 180 degrees.  The object (its lights) were frequently changing, and/or blinking.  I saw red lights, white lights, and at least one other color.  At one point, when the object was stopped, I counted the white light as it flashed 26 times in approximately 3 seconds.  Suddenly, the object began its rapid movement again, and finally disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness, who elects to remain totally anonymous, indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));48.086504;-123.588
Unexplainably loud , extremely close,  hovering noise which resembles a large aircraft.;2003-11-14 12:00:00;10-15 seconds;Unexplainably loud , extremely close,  hovering noise which resembles a large aircraft. This is not what I saw , but rather what myself and two dogs heard. We were approx. 1/3 of a mile west of the Fairchild airport in Lincoln Park.  A wooded area that I always walk my dogs through. I grew up here in Port Angeles and have been in this park at least 100 times over the last 30 years. Also the runway at this airport is not large enough for what we heard. It was the sound of a large, (very large) aircraft.  I say aircraft because it sounded as though it was right on top of us, and my two dogs stopped in their tracks and began to crawl something I've never seen them do.  I have never been behind a jet engine as it decelerated or accelerated but I thought, actually I dont know what I thought. But I do know this: I did not hear anything prior or after the initial encounter, and it sounded as if steel was being drug across the asphalt. Similar to an excavator , or a cat when their bucket is drug across the roadway when doing road repairs,  Except this was a 100 times louder.;48.086504;-123.588

While driving towards Lake Crescent near Port Angeles, WA, at night, I saw a light in the sky and took a picture.   I didn't notice the photo until months later.
