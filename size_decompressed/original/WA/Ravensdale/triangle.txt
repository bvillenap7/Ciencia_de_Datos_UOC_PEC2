The lights were multi colored and there were maybe about 20 of them.  I stopped my car to get my cell phone so I could take a picture.  When I found my camera and looked backup to where it was it wa gone.  The area is very rural and there were some power lines near by.  This was definitly not any type of aircraft that I have ever seen before.  The area I am describing is about 5 miles from Black Diamond WA.  This is significant because a UFO siting occurred in this area on Sept 2.;47.3407;-121.8874
