Small Fireball moved from east to west over southern Hood Canal;2004-10-12 21:10:00;>1 min;Small Fireball moved from east to west over southern Hood Canal.  Was slow moving and redish in color, but burned up fast.  Was not the electric white/blue of a meteor or shooting star.  A few minutes later I saw a long streak going from east to west but north of where the fireball was, but it also was not the electric white/blue of a normal shooting star.  This trail was almost invisible but I could see it because I was looking and it went across the entire sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));47.4297;-122.9306
Large orange/red orb moving diagonally and down in the daytime.;2020-11-18 14:08:00;15 seconds.;Large orange/red orb moving diagonally and down in the daytime. While driving through town on my way back home from a hunting trip, I saw what I can only describe as a rather large orange/red, orb for the lack of a better word, moving downward toward the earth.  It wasn't dropping from the sky, but rather moving diagonally and downward.  I estimated it to be several miles away toward the town of Allen, so between Belfair and Allen I would assume.  It wasn't moving fast nor leaving any type of smoke trail. It had to be fairly big, because even though it seemed to be miles away it was still very large in the sky. My best guess would be over 100 yards long, but I may be way off because it all happened so fast.  I was in traffic and obviously didn't want to have an accident. When I got to the traffic light it was no longer visible, so I started looking around for other people to see if anyone was looking and/or pointing but nobody was.  I texted my hunting partner and told him what I just saw.  I just want to know if anyone else in Mason County saw what I did, or maybe someone whom can explain what I saw?;47.4297;-122.9306
