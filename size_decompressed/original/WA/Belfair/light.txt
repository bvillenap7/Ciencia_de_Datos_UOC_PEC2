fast moving zigzaging light.;2004-02-14 21:00:00;2 seconds;fast moving zigzaging light. I was driving home on the old belfair hwy, about four miles south of the bear creek duwatto turn off, It was a light, the size and intensity of a magnitude 2 star, quickly making its way towards the horizon line. The path it took was not straight, but wavered, and then disappeared belowed the treeline. It looked to be traveling straight down, but if it was traveling straight out, would have been traveling at a very fast rate. There was no trail of light behind it, as a shooting star would have. I expected to see a flash of impact, but there was none. I pulled off the road at a clear cut to see if there was anymore activity, but there was none.  I have seen numerous shooting stars, fireballs, comets, satelites ,the re-entry of space juck and other aerial displays, but this fit none of them. It was very strange to me and I spend alot of time looking at the skies for astronomical events.;47.4297;-122.9306
String of 100 lights flying in over washington state  ((Starlink satellites));2010-05-22 05:00:00;30 minutes?;String of 100 lights flying in over washington state There was a single file row of lights evenly spaced apart moving east to west or in a very large circle pattern. After a few minutes formation of incoming lights changed to 1 light followed by 2 lights still spaced the same distance apart except the 2 lights following the 1st were much closer together vertically. Lights kept coming in at regular intervals till almost daylight. 5AM to almost 6 am. What the heck is going on? Must have seen around 60 to 100 lights. There was no sound emitted.;47.4297;-122.9306
Bright lights changing formation and the flying straight up until they disappeared.;2016-12-25 18:50:00;7 minutes;Bright lights changing formation and the flying straight up until they disappeared. At 18:49 I was surprised to see what I at first believed to be red flares in the low east sky from my residence.  It wasn't until 9 of the came into view and went from a straight line into a shape that resembled the Little Dipper that I realized these craft were flying.  They proceeded to change to a southward direction, as well as gained more altitude. I ran for my camera and had someone else come and see what was going on.  In less than 5 minutes time they had again changed formation and were disappearing into the sky as they changed direction and went straight up into the sky.;47.4297;-122.9306
