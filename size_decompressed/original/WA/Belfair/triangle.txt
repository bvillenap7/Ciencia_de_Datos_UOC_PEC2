Last night I saw a triangle with a light on each corner of the craft, and it was very high in altitude and it was huge is size.  It had to be at least 40,000 feet up if not higher and it was moving slowly from west to east.  It was located slightly west of the big dipper and soon cloud cover obscured it's sight. I doubt that most people would see something like this because it was so high up and the lights on each corner were like dim stars.  If I didn't have a grid above me that allows me to track movement, I would have never seen it.  I can't possibly say what they were doing except maybe they were going to check out Mt. Saint Helens as it erupted yesterday evening.;47.4297;-122.9306
