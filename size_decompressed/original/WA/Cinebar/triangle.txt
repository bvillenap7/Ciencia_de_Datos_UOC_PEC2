Three bright lights, white with a hint of blue moving east then turning south. After the turn was concluded the craft seemed to rise and go into space because the lights merged together as they faded out rather quickly.  No sound was made. Our area is out of town area that is very quiet and no city lights to reflect.  We have a lot of aircraft traffic to compare too, those you can hear easy.;46.5786;-122.5704
