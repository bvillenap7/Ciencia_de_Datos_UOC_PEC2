The silent object was the largest thing I have ever seen above the ground.;1993-05-14 13:00:00;5 min;The silent object was the largest thing I have ever seen above the ground. Huge craft (at least football field size).  No sound.  It had colored lights that did not seem to be lighting up the surrounding area.  It was gliding very slowly about 100 feet above the trees behind our house.  Both my son and I witnessed the event in different parts of the house but did not discuss it for years.  I could not see the shape from the angle I saw it.  My thoughts at the time were, wow!!! that's big.  I can't do anything about that so I went back to bed.  It was surreal to me.  I was somewhat relieved when people started to report similar sightings many years later.  It wasn't what I had heard being reported at the time - not saucer shaped etc.  I am a school teacher and my son was about 8 at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Black helicopters and a strange hum!?;2003-06-08 01:00:00;10 minutes;Black helicopters and a strange hum!? It was in the middle of the night, early Sunday morning.  I am not sure what the exact time was because I currently do not have a clock in my bedroom on hand... I felt it must've been some time between 1-3 A.M.  I had my window open all night since the weather was warm earlier that day.  For some strange reason, I woke up out of a sound sleep and seconds later I heard what sounded like a small airplane buzzing in the distance and it was getting closer.  After a moment the sound grew louder and louder and I recognized that it was the sound of helicopters, maybe two or three.  These helicopters then began to fly EXTREMELY low over and through the tree tops of our quiet wooded neighborhood.  I knew that by this time, all of the neighbors were probably awaken by this event.  The helicopters, for ten minutes circled low, several times as if looking for something.  They were low, but circled a wide perimeter of the forest and I could not see them.  It was the last couple of minutes, one of the helicopters finally circled in closer.  I saw a black helicopter with a very bright searchlight and with bright blue and red lights underneath.  I did not see the other two, but I know there was more than one.  I'm not sure if they were King County Police or military!?  After ten minutes, they flew away in the southwest direction.  It was right after they left, I heard a strange low hum outside in the area that lasted for a few minutes and faded.  In the morning, I asked my family, who also had their windows open, if they woke up and heard this terribly loud event and they said, No, and that they were all fast asleep.  Something was strange about this.  These helicopters were frantically chasing and looking for something in these woods. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We would very much like to communicate with the party.  We have no other reports of this incident, and we wonder if it is a serious report.  PD));47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
Bright dot of light over Woodinville skies.;2014-03-12 09:30:00;15 minutes;Bright dot of light over Woodinville skies. I saw a bright light in the south western (WSW) sky at about a 45°altitude,which was somewhat brighter than the planet Venus.   I also saw Venus at a much lower altitude in the southeastern (SSE) at approximatley 30° altitude.  The unknown object moved in an easterly motion extremely slow to about a 60° altitude.   Then the object turned in a slow arc and moved northerly.   Duration was about 15 minutes.   What was startling was the slowness of the object.  Do they still send weather balloons aloft?;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
