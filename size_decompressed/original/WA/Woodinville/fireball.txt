Probably just a meteor....but...;2001-08-26 23:08:00;.5 seconds;Probably just a meteor....but... Observed what appeared to be a shooting star, yet unlike any I have seen before.  Moving south to north, observed due west of me, and I am east of Woodinville.  Range of observation, hold your arm out at almost a 45 degree angle, spread your fingers, observed from tip of pinky to tip of thumb, and it took about .5 seconds to cover that span of the sky.  Trees were obscuring any more of it's trajectory.  What made it look different was the slower speed (most shooting stars I have seen are maybe a tenth of a second), and the illumination looked like maybe a landing light on an aircraft.  It was quite bright, as the night sky to the west of here is not that dark because of city lights, yet this meteor-like object was easily visible.  The tail would be about the width of a finger at arms length.  Color was headlight white, yet not as white as a halogen type light.  In the past, I observed the falling pieces of some satelite over Seattle several years ago.  Those were burning with a green glow, and seemed to be falling slowly, from north to south.  The falling pieces were visible for several seconds, and were obviously much slower than meteors.  This current sighting was pretty fast, and most likely a meteor, but it was certainly a bright one.
