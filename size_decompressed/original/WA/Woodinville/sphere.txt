It was a bright-blueish white light that hovered about a mile away in the distance, making no sound, then it moved over some tree tops and slowly lowered into the trees.  A half hour before this incident, my mother and I heard and saw a helicopter circling several times in the area as if looking for something. My younger sister came to me saying that when looked by chance outside her bedroom window she saw a bright, round glowing object in the far South East sky outside of our home in Woodinville.  It was a bright-blueish white light that hovered about a mile away in the distance, making no sound.  I ran with her to the window and she said it was previously hovering in the night sky and notice it wasn't going anywhere.  When I saw it, it was above the trees and going down vertical into the obstruction of the trees. A half hour before this incident, my mother and I heard and saw a helicopter circling several times in the area as if looking for something.  Several neighbors in the area say they have seen the light the past couple of weeks.  Just might let you know!;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
Golden/brass colored sphere travelling south to north over Woodenville at speed comparable to jet hellicopter;2001-03-13 22:50:00;1-2 minutes;Golden/brass colored sphere travelling south to north over Woodinville at speed comparable to jet hellicopter I don't remember the exact time, but it was shortly before 11 PM and I was travelling eastbound on Woodenville-Duvall Road, when I notice a golden colored sphere travelling from the south heading north.  I pulled over to safely view the object.  It was travelling at a spead comparable to that of jet hellicopter, but it had no marking lights normally associated with such craft.  It continued north at a low alltitude until I lost visual contact once it entered the tree line.  I didn't think much of it, until I heard other reports in the community, and on local radio station. ((NUFORC Note:  The e-address of this witness is so bizarre, we are uncertain as to whether this is a serious report.  PD));47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
