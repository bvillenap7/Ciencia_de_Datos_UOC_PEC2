Saw 6 white, round objects in the sky in 2 formations of 3 each.;2001-08-03 18:00:00;10 to 15 seconds;Saw 6 white, round objects in the sky in 2 formations of 3 each. While I was driving I saw 6 objects in the sky in the distance.  They were in 2 groups of 3 in a chevron, like an airplane formation.  They were round and flat, like a disk or frisbee.  From the distance I'd say they were roughly small ariplane sized.  I was struck by how solid they appeared, at first I thought it could be glare or refelection, but they had a substance to them.  The sun was shining brightly through the clouds from the oposite side of the sky (from my perspective)  But they didn't have any reflective qualities, just soft white in color with no markings.  They seemed to be moving, not very fast, but moving.  They went behind some clouds and then I didn't see them anymore.  I've never seen a UFO before and I'm not compelled one way or the other with UFO's but I did see something that I couldn't identify.  I saw them clearly enough to say that they weren't like any other aircraft I've even seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Precise date apparently is unknown by the witness.

A white color circle light flying low to the ground with a black circle in the middle of the white one;2009-08-27 00:46:00;1 seconds;A white color  circle light flying low to the ground with a black circle in the middle of the white one I was sitting on my coutch and my dad had just walked in from getting some food to sit on a chair to the right of me and i looked up at him and when i did so i saw a Single Perfectly Circuliar disk flying 25-70 feet above tree line threw my skylight for a single second and i couldent belive that i had seen that. To immagin what i had just seen,  Look at a CD and from the outside of the CD put ur finger 1 1/2 inches on it and immagine that with a event ammount of light all the way around it was not a very bright light but like a normal bedroom white colored light but a bit brighter with pitch black in the middle of what i could see. Flying at a Fairly quick speed with no sound i heard. i could hardly belive that that had just happend i was speechless. ((NUFORC Note:  Original date was flawed.  Correct date is August 27, not December 27, 2009.  PD));47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667

Observed 12 objects, evenly spaced in a linear path, moving ENE over Snohomish Co.. ((Spacelink satellites??));2020-02-19 05:45:00;20 minutes;Observed 12 objects, evenly spaced in a linear path, moving ENE over unincorporated Snohomish County outside of Woodinville, WA.  The speed of the objects was clearly much faster than a plane.  The objects were too high to clearly observe a shape, but appeared circular in outline. The observer has a science background with a Ph.D.;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
