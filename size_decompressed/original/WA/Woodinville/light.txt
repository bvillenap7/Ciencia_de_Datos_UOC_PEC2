It had a very long tail white to orange in color. It's speed was compairable to a slow shooting star.  I saw the object just over the tree line, but it was quite a ways in the distance. It shot across the sky like a shooting star or metor, but it did not fade out like one. My whole siting was about three seconds. I stopped and stood on the running board of my S-10 Blazer, but the object was just gone! It traveled in a north to south-west direction. The next day I told my neighbor about this stating that was the biggest shooting star I have ever seen As I said in the brief above. I clearly saw at least three colors white, green and a very brite orange. I am 34 years old, a retail manager. I have lived most of my life in and around the Snohomish area.;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667

Approximately eight - not sure about that. These blue lights were noticed in the clouds.  The lights did not appear to be originating from the ground as can be seen with a search light.  The lights seemed to be in the clouds and glowing in the clouds.  The lights were somewhat in a line but space apart - some closer than others.  I am not sure about the distance the lights spanned but could have been 2000ft - really hard to tell.  My wife and I saw them for only 5-10 seconds and then they were gone.  Another car was stopped on the off ramp of the freeway and seemed to be watching the lights - they had gotten there before us.  I have never seen lights in the sky like this.;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667

The Same Bright Light !;2003-07-22 22:29:00;1-2 minutes;The Same Bright Light ! At 10:29 pm, on 07/22/03, I again witnessed the bright UFO that I also reported seeing the night before in the Woodinville area on 07/21/03.  This time, I didn not see the second mysterious craft, but the bright light this time came from the southwest sky and headed North.  I had my camcorder and recorded the event before a cloud layer moved in.  Again, some aircraft were close to the object as it traveled at a good speed across the sky.  I showed family members the tape and they could see how bright the object was compared to the stars that were also seen on the tape.  The footage has been sent via e-mail to Mr. Davenport.  -Anonymous ((NUFORC Note:  Follow-yp correspondence with witness: Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),    Thank you very much for the note, and for the video clip.

Green Light in the North-Northeastern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor.  PD));2003-08-20 23:22:00;2-3 Seconds;Green Light in the North-Northeastern sky From my hometown of Woodinville, I witnessed a bright green object in the north-northeastern ski (looking out around cassiopia) which was so bright it lit up near by treetops.  It lasted at most two and a half seconds.  The object was going from left to right and downward at approxamitly a 45-50 degree angle.  It left no trail. ((NUFORC Note:  The object appeared to be a meteor.  I also saw it in the northeastern sky, at the same time the witness indicates above.  My description, forwarded to a group of astronomers in British Columbia and Washington State follows:  I was personal witness to a rather dramatic blue-green meteor over Seattle on Wednesday night, August 20th, 2003.  It occurred in the north-northeastern sky at approximately 2322 hrs. (local/Pacific Daylight Time), and lasted approximately 1-3 seconds.  It may have passed through Cassiopeia, or just to the east of that formation, descending from left to right at approximately 30-40 degrees from the vertical, and traversing an estimated 40-50 degrees of arc.  Duration was approximately 1-3 seconds.  It left no visible trail, although it was shedding material as it descended.  No terminal burst was visible, and no sonic report was detected for up to 10 minutes after the event. Conditions were ideal for viewing at the time of the event.  CAVU/no clouds visible.  If NUFORC receives written reports from other witnesses, I would be happy to forward them. Peter PD));47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667

I walked outside and looked to the south and observed Jupiter.  I am pretty familiar with the night sky, and Jupiter was to be expected.   But I quickly notices a pair of “stars” to the left of Jupiter by about 15 or 20 degrees.  If this pair was two marks on a clock, I would say they were at 10:30 and about 4:30, separated by the width of my little finger at an arms length.  These two lights were bright, as it was not totally dark yet, but they were clear to be seen.  They were low to the horizon, maybe just lower than Jupiter’s relative height above the horizon.  Being a bright pair was unusual, and after staring at them for about a minute, I just felt like they were moving faster than…stars move due to earth’s rotation.  So I tried to mark their position to a tree branch, and I do believe they were moving away from me, to the SSE, getting closer to the horizon.  The one at 4:30 position faded out first, and then the one at 10:30 faded out.  Probably satelites, but the pair is unusual for me to see.  I have seen three satelites moving together in the past, in the mid to late 90’s.  So I know it happens, but like I said, I just wanted to post this little piece that I did observe, in case somebody saw more of it, for verification purposes.  I checked for ISS passes, and I couldn’t find one during this time frame.  There was a listing for Cosmos 1408, but…I think I saw this pair prior to when Cosmos would have passed over as a single object.  Oh well.  Still waiting to see the one light that stops and takes a left!  PD...just delete this post if nobody else saw anything interesting.  I just wanted to give witness to the pair of objects.  Possibly two satelites that faded out near the horizon due to atmosphere.  I just don't see pairs or multiple satelites that often.;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
ISS-looking bright ufo flies over Washington at great speed or low altitude, or both....;2017-07-04 21:55:00;5 seconds;ISS-looking bright ufo flies over Washington at great speed or low altitude, or both.... I am open to any explanation as to what I saw, but, I feel I am pretty good at identifying aerial phenomenon, and I can’t figure this one out. 7/4/2017, 2155 hours PST, watching fireworks.  I already know what you are thinking.  No. Not 30 seconds before I stated, maybe we will see a UFO.  And then there it was.  The following is why I am baffled.   Location, general, King County, Washington State, general street coordinates 195 Av NE/NE 175 St.  Direction of flight, southeast. Appearance, looked like the ISS going over, but about 5 or more times faster in travel, and….maybe twice as bright.  ISS is not supposed to be visible here tonight.  There was an Iridium Flare listed for about 2155, but I thought it was going to flare to the north, not travel southeast-bound like a bright, non-dimming object that looked like a bright ISS. My millisecond thought process as I watched it for about 4-5 seconds (it was moving out!) was at first….oh, there’s a piece of burning magnesium powder from a firework. Wait, it is not dimming, and it is moving in a straight line.  Oh, looks like the ISS.  Negative, it is not visible tonight.  This is too fast, the speed is like a low flying airplane going over.  But it is bright.  Maybe an aircraft, no, not seeing any green/red navigation lights, just looks exactly like a bright ISS. The only way I can try to explain it is, but I don’t believe my own explanation because of what I saw, was, a helicopter flying over with a bright search light shining mainly downward, drowning out the red/green nav lights, and I can’t hear it because of the fireworks in the area. So, UFO is correct in that, I can’t identify what I saw.  I would welcome any explanation because I am not sure how to classify this in my own mind.  If I could look at radar recordings in this area, I would do so.  If anybody can, and they can tell me what the heck it was that we saw, I would appreciate it.  I only had, at best, 10 degrees of view because of a nearby tree, but we saw it continue on, without dimming, through the branches a couple times. UPDATE:  I started reporting this at about 2245 hours PST, 7/4/2017.  My brother texted, and we have since spoken on the phone.  He is in Maui.  His text, at 2252 hours PST was, “I think I just saw the space station go over Maui here and it was hauling as_”.   More texts, and I had to call him.  He is in Kaanapoli.  Looking WNW between Molokai and Lanai Islands.  He sees something in the sky to the SW, south of Lanai, moving generally west to east, but south of his location.  I questioned him carefully.  No nav lights, looked exactly like the ISS, not dimmer or brighter, but many times faster.  He thought, jet airliner altitude (30000 feet or so).  He explained it away as the ISS, but hauling as_.   He next explained it away as a satellite losing altitude and coming back to earth.  No trail at all, like shooting stars or space debris (which I have seen back in I believe the 90’s when a piece of Soviet debris came down and was visible from Washington State, it left a green trail! as it burned on re-entry).  How long did he see it?  2 to 3 seconds!  Wow.  Mine was 4-5 seconds, and I am sure he had a better view in Maui.  The thing was moving fast!. Ok, I am done for now.  I have not been stumped by objects in the sky until tonight, and I am in my 50’s.  So, there it is, for comparison to other reports.  My gut feeling is, if my girlfriend and I saw something and my brother saw something far away in Maui, there may be a slew of sightings coming in!  While I was typing this, my girlfriend already found youtube videos from tonight with ufo’s, UFO spotted in Norwalk, California, July 7th 2017.  But, the ufo in that video was barely moving compared to what we saw.  And, what we saw was more of a white light, like the ISS, not orange.   Signing off.   I hope to learn from other reports if I am still waiting to see my first UFO, or if this is explainable and I need to keep looking.   Thanks PD!   And, PD, please reply if this can be explained.;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667

It was already dark and as I pulled into my garage I saw a light out of the corner of my eye in my back yard.  It caught my attention right away because I don’t have any lights in my back yard as I live in a wooded area with only a few lights from an adjacent street that are visible. The light seem to appear to be silently floating around near the creek about 30 feet or so up in the air and as I got closer I saw there were two lights that appeared orange in color and seemed to be very small.  I started recording with my phone and as I got closer one became bright very much like a small, but intense LED as if it turned to face my direction.  I couldn’t tell if it had a light in front and perhaps rotated or if it just changed and became bright. Both ended up doing this off and on and continued to float through and around the trees from East to West. As I went back toward my house to get my wife to witness I saw a couple more in the neighbor’s field on the other side of our property as well. They were completely silent and ranging from about 20 – 40 feet off the ground, all moving from East to West.  Although I heard no noise, I later found watching the video that the microphone did pick up a strange clicking type of noise when it was at its closest. I was a bit freaked out and went inside and asked my wife to come out and verify I was seeing what I was seeing.  My behavior was scaring her a bit but when I pointed them out, she saw them and was also surprises and a little scared.  I went back outside and to the neighbor’s house to show him as well. Over about an hour a saw perhaps a dozen of these lights. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. Afterward I went back home and became very tired, falling asleep on the couch.  Although I didn’t experience an loss of time nor did I touch or make any physical contact, my wife and kids told me the next day I was moving and twisting around on the couch hitting my head with my hands and that my head was sweating profusely.  They said they tried to wake me but couldn’t.  I felt like I slept very soundly and don’t recall any of that.;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
