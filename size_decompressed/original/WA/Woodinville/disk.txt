The object appeared to be moving from south to west approximately 15 degrees above the horizon.  There were seven white lights equallly spaced around the object. It appeared to be banking slightly as I could easily see a bright red pulsating light in the middle of the underside of the object.  It disappeared behind many large douglas fir trees and was not seen again.  The red light appeared to pulsate at one second intervals.  The apparent size of the object in my field of view was approximately one inch in diameter.
