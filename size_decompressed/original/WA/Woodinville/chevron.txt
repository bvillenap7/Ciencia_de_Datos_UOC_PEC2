The 'object'(for lack of a better word) appeared to be a sort of glowing gradient where the leading edge of the 'wing' was a fairly deep orange, and the trailing edge seemed to be glowing orange-yellow, and may have been leaving an orange-yellow trail all along the trainling edge of the 'wing' as it moved. The incident was entirely silent. There were planes in the air, but far off in a different quadrant of the sky they had nothing to do with this object. The object appeared for about a second, long enough for me to alert my wife, but by the time she tried to see it, it was gone.;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
Silent boomerang shaped craft without lights;2002-04-30 22:04:00;5 seconds;Silent boomerang shaped craft without lights My 2 other roommates and I were outside on our back porch/deck, sitting down on our patio furniture looking up at the stars in the sky, when suddenly one of my roommates interjected, Hey, look at that!!!  The boomerang-shaped object had no visible lights but was clearly distinguishable from the night sky, as if it was metallic/reflective/or light-colored.  It silently sailed in a straight line in a SSE (south south easterly) direction for no more than what could have been 5 seconds.  If my attention had not been drawn to the object I would had never noticed it!  The sky was mostly clear, but there were a few clouds.  The object disappeared from view into a cloud, so I'm going under the assumption the object had to have been up several thousand feet.  The relative size of the object I believe was large (i.e. larger than your commercial jet plane), relative to the size or a quarter or a tad bit smaller in perspective and appeared to have been traveling at a constant, high rate of speed (15-degrees of the sky in a manner of those fleeting seconds.)  Also, it is important to note that the V of the boomerang was the front of the craft as it was moving.  The wing tips were rounded and it really did have an overall pronounced boomerang shape, not as sharp as a 90-degree angle, I would have to say it had a 120-degree angle to it. I do not believe this was a stealth bomber I have seen pictures of the stealth and this did not have the wider midsection of a stealth bomber with the notches.  The craft my roomates and I saw almost had the appearance of a glider, it had no larger/wider area where a cockpit would be in the V.  By all recollections the craft had no distinguishing marks on it, except for one of my roommates, she professes that she could make out a thin, black band that laterally ran across it (the band running along the front side of the craft, the side of the boomerang moving forward).;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
