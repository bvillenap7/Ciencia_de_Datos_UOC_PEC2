It was very dark out, and at the top of the treeline to the south west, we saw a horizotal teardrop craft. It was a blue-yellow color, but had a blue-ish dome on top. There were lights that looked like strings of icicle lights strung from the top of the dome to the outermost edges of the teardrop body. On the very bottom was a red light that flashed. On the top was a green light. The craft hovered at first, but then started to move, much faster than an airplane, to the north west, and got dimmeras it went. It did not appear to be spinning. it then fadded away above the treeline, which appeared to be between Woodinville and Redmond;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
