Possible Drone flying type object around apartment community;2013-12-30 02:30:00;15 minutes;Possible Drone flying type object around apartment community I am a property manager and this is the statement of one of my residents. On 12/20/2013, I was outside at about 0230 at Beaumont Apartments in Woodinville, WA.   I heard a “wrrring” sound and looked up to see a square flying object. It was flying around the apartment buildings, through trees and at various heights.  I was walking my dog and the object would come over and hover over me.  It would then migrate very high very quickly.  It would go around buildings of which a simple toy could not have done due to no visibility when it would approach the back of the buildings.  I was watching it, but I could not see any person in the area.  I watched it for about 15 minutes, of which it came and hover over me again. To the best that I can estimate, it was between 2 to 3 feet square.  It appeared to have four landing “legs” and you could hear the engine.  At times it was very slow and at times extremely fast.  Again, I looked around and could not see any person.  After about 15 minutes I went back in the building and did not see it again. I have not seen it since until about 0400 this morning, 1/8/2014.  I was up in my apartment, but had no lights on and saw several flashes from the outside.  This continued for about 2 hours.  I live on the third floor of the apartments.;47.7610166666667;-122.089779166667
