Triangle UFO seen South of Colfax, WA, on HWY 195;2015-04-02 00:20:00;2 minutes;Triangle UFO seen South of Colfax, WA on HWY 195 I am a business man, and I was driving South on US HWY 195 from Spokane to Pullman, WA., to spend the night and attend a meeting.   I was just South of Colfax, WA, when I saw an aircraft with white lights head South toward Dayton, WA, area.  It appeared to be traveling at quite a fast speed, I would estimate 300 to 400 MPH.  Then it abruptly rose and headed due north parallel to HWY 195.  It was traveling quite fast then slowed and seemed to hover somewhat about 1/2 mile off Hwy.  I was very curious but some what scared to stop car and get a closer look.   I went fwd up HWY about 2 miles then U-turned to come back and get a better look.  I saw light off in distance but it was heading North towards Spokane and now a good 10 Mi or so North.  Therefore, I stopped pursuing it.   The craft was Triangle in shape and appeared to have a 90 degree angle on the sides.  It looked like a triangle box.  It looked black and had 3 white lights on the side with one red light.   It was about the size of a couple 35 to 40 Ft Motor Home on one side of the triangle.  It appeared to make no significant sound.;46.8832;-117.3704
