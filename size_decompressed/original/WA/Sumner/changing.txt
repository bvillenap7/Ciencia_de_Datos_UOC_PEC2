Odd lights and shapes in Sumner, Washington;2003-10-16 22:30:00;45 min-1hr.;Odd lights and shapes in Sumner, Washington I can't fully explain the video I just watched that my friend shot last night near the Post Office in Sumner Washington. All I can say is it was a windy, dark night but the air was warm. She has caught something on film that is not all reflections of light - the shapes turn to beakers, rectangles, and squares - one definite blue ball and seems when they get near the lights on the poles, those lights get very bright. We need someone to watch this nearly hour video to get their opinion. At one point a light turns red in the sky, blurs and then suddenly becomes a silver bar. There is also a purple light that shows up too. The camera also was exhibiting different characteristics while filming - PLEASE CAN SOMEONE GET IN TOUCH WITH US! I have the video here but trying to figure out how to send it to you.;47.209;-122.2336
