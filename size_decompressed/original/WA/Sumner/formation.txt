We saw 3 illuminated objects in a 3 point formation cross the night sky.;1999-09-07 22:30:00;3 to 4 min.;We saw 3 illuminated objects in a 3 point formation cross the night sky. I have watched the nite sky for many years in WA. state ( sputnik as a kid with my dad ) now I watch with my son (10 yrs old)On warm nites we try to see 6 satelites in orbit before going inside.It usually takes around an hour.This is the THIRD nite we have sighted these objects!! They move slowly from WNW to SSE .They move in a 3 point triangular formation with a leader up front and 2 following about 2 finger width apart with my arm out-stretched.They do not seem to hold perfect formation at times deviating slightly from position.They just look like moving stars untill they enter the southern sky where they fade and then disapear.Just look up around 10:30 to see them.;47.209;-122.2336

November 4th, 2011 approx. 19:00 hour driving North/Northeast in Sumner Washington saw 15 orangey/red glowing spheres in a 3D/hexagon/circle shape. As I was watching them they sarted desappearing (saw eight as I turned the corner). About a mile down the road there were 4 people standing on the side of the road and a car stopped looking toward the sky were I saw them.  I stopped and asked did you see what I saw about 15 orangey/red glowing lights.   Answer:  Yes but, we counted 20 when we first saw them and then the lights starting disappearing and now they are gone. To the right and left of the objects (much farther North) were commercial airliners descending into Sea-Tac. (planes were stacked and had white lights).;47.209;-122.2336
