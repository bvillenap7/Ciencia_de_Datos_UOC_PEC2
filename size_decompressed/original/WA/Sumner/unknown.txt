Possible plane with beam.;2014-06-07 23:05:00;23:12;possible plane with beam Saturday evening June, 7th, 2014, I went out to dinner by myself.  I got home around 11pm. It was warm, clear sky with visible stars.  I think I saw only one thing in the sky.   It was about 11:05 pm.  I was sitting on the patio having a smoke while the dog and cat sat with me.  I noticed what I figured was a plane come from the east.  I figured it was a small plane from one of the homes near Lake Tapps or Buckley area as it was flying pretty low.  I did not hear a plane sound though.  It was cruising at a pretty good speed.   I grabbed my binoculars and could see a green light at one end and a red at the other which again is what made me think it was a small plane although I could not actually see a shape.  I set the binoculars on the table in front of me and looked back to the sky and could not find it again.  That seemed strange cuz it was not flying ‘that’ fast and the sky was clear.  I searched and searched.   Grabbed the binoculars again but still could not find it.  I put my cigarette out and suddenly seen a flashing light coming in my direction now and it had a beam emitting from it.  It was a weird beam in that I could see it coming from the object and followed its trajectory but it fazed out in the middle of the trajectory and it could hardly be seen as it aimed closer to the ground.   The object went right over my apartments but the beam seemed slanted and then they were gone.   I’m not sure what it was but as it passed over the apt. it hardly made a sound.;47.209;-122.2336
