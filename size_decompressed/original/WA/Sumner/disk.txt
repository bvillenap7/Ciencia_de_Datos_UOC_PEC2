The doors were large, a simi could fit.  The ship was surrounded by a light green tint that made this craft very large.  I stopped my car and got outside and heard nothing.  From all reports this ship was the mother ship and many reports of small crafts seen by over 3000 personnel, report by news paper.

The sky was fifty percent overcast. the clouds were cumulus, big,white and puffy. The sky that you could see between the clouds was very blue. The clouds were not moving fast they were approximately 7000 ft. I was by myself loading boxes in a pick up truck when the daylight halfmoon caught my eye, it was standing out very bright in the western sky. As I stood there looking at the moon something moving three fingers blow the moon really set me back a bit. It was a Disk in shape very smooth and luminated like a flourescent bulb. It was moving south, I was looking up at a 45 degree angle. I watched it for about 4 sec then it went behind a cloud, I thought it was over but it came out the other side of the cloud I watched it for about 3 more sec and then it made a wide arc to the west and disapeared. I am a pilot and I shoot aerial photos. I know aircraft when I see them. If anyone else saw this please report. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));47.209;-122.2336
