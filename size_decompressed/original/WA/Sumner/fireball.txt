Green fireball sweeps across the sky horizontally and vanishes;2015-12-04 18:45:00;2.5 seconds;Green fireball sweeps across the sky horizontally and vanishes Friday, December 4, 2015, at about 6:50 PM, I am pulling canvas off of a large Star I am making for Christmas.  I walked back toward the house to get open the garage door to continue removing the tarp when I see a brilliant light move from East to West in the distance.  It appears to be about 20 degrees above the horizon and covers about 30 degrees of the sky moving almost perfectly horizontally with just a slight curve for gravity.   It was only visible for two seconds and it appeared to vanish into a cloud.  It was such a bright green color, I thought it was a roman candle until I noticed how far away it was. It had a dimmer orange tail. It made no noise.  I estimated it to be the size of a BB if held at arms length, but have no idea how big it really was.  Years ago, I saw a boloid or large meteorite camping at Spirit Lake when I was a boy (before the mountain blew). It was green as well but not as brilliant green as this.  This also moved faster and seemed closer than something in space or in orbit.;47.209;-122.2336
