I was sitting out in my side yard (which is on the west side of house).   I lit up my cigarette and just happen to look up to the west and this neon green/blue light fell from the sky, stopped half way and went directly north in a matter of seconds.   It was fast really fast.  I could hear that the power lines were buzzing loud!   Prior to the light incident my husband also said he could hear a rumble sound.  He thought possible thunder.  My daughter says that once the green/blue light went poof she noticed off to the north that the sky lite up really bright for a second or so...;47.0022;-123.4954
