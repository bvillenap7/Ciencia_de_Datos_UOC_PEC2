White darting light in the sky over field in Bonney Lake, WA near old Sumner-Buckley highway.;2007-01-13 23:00:00;1 Second;White darting light in the sky over field in Bonney Lake, WA near old Sumner-Buckley highway. Just to state, I was just driving home from a friends tonight when I saw it. It is now 12:05 AM as I write this sentence. What I saw happened not less than an hour ago.  I was driving westbound on Old Sumner Buckley Highway just behind the fairly recently built Target. I was on the phone with my girlfriend at a redlight admiring the stars on an unusually clear night. I then proceeded westbound with the greenlight when to my right (north of me) I saw a bright light moving VERY swiftly in an arcing vector. It was moving relatively parallel to me heading westbound and dissapeared behind the treeline. It looked as if it were already on a trajectory somewhat like a missile coming down to a target in an arcing manor. To be honest as stupid as it sounds, I thought it was in fact a missile. It looked fairly high in the sky but nothing like an airplane. Maybe a 2 or 3 thousand feet at the highest. It came eastbound across a large field in a straight trajectory until getting closer to the treeline when it took I'd say a 15-20 degree angle change and dove in a curving manor behind the treeline. All of this happened so quickly, it couldn't have been more than a second. It must have moved a a mile or so in that time.  The light was basically just a white ball. There was no tail like a comet what have and no blinking lights like an airplane. That's why I thought it might have been the tail of the missile and not a comet or something. After it passed however, there was no exhaust trail and furthermore why would there be a missile flying over Bonney Lake. I then repeated what I saw to my girlfriend who is thanks to me probably having trouble falling asleep right now. I took a few side roads driving home in hopes of seeing it again, but had no such luck. I've never reported a UFO before and feel silly doing so right now, but I'm sort of hoping to find out what it really was or could have been.;47.1435;-122.1678
Bright ball of light with a large flash that lit up the sky;2013-11-03 06:30:00;5 seconds;Bright ball of light with a large flash that lit up the sky My 14 year old son and I were driving on a back road at 6:30 pm.  It was dark out, no rain.   A very large circle of light quickly appeared and flashed the sky with a beam of light.  It was blinding, and lasted only a second.  I pulled the car over because we were both astonished at what we had just seen.;47.1435;-122.1678
Objects too large to be drones and too slow and left no trail like rockets.;2019-09-28 21:00:00;15 minutes;Objects too large to be drones and too slow and left no trail like rockets. Many large lights seen going up into the sky slowly, different speeds and generally the same direction but not completely.  3 different waves.  Went up until we couldnâ€™t see them any more.  Above the high clouds.  3 of us took videos.;47.1435;-122.1678
