Silent diamond shapes with 6 or 7 yellow or brilliant white lights giving them their sense of shape over Puget Sound, WA;2010-06-23 23:00:00;90 minutes;Silent diamond shapes with 6 or 7 yellow or brilliant white lights giving them their sense of shape over Puget Sound, WA At 22:30 my entire neighborhood began coming outside their homes to witness diamond shaped lights in the sky just above the horizon and below the moon in the area of Mt. Rainier with some coming as close as to hover over Puget Sound at the South End of Vashon Island.   Observers included primarily skeptics and people who work in engineering who were trying to figure out what could possibly make the silent lights that glowed yellow and white.   They moved slowly in a variety of ways that were unlike any known aircraft.   I have video and still shots from an Olympus FE320 which I posted to Facebook.   Each shape had 6 lights on it.  They were silent but our military sent helicopters and airplanes over to investigate as we have a naval airbase close by and we couple hear the helicopters and planes when they arrived but the shapes remained silent, they suddenly gathered together and sped away faster than our eyes could follow. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the other witnesses submit reports.  Also, we have invited the source of this report to forward copies of the photos and video.  PD));47.425;-122.4586
