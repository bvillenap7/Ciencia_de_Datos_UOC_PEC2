Semi-circle of lights flashing outside a hazy circle.;2011-09-01 01:55:00;15 minues;Semi-circle of lights flashing outside a hazy circle. I took my dog out and while he was taking care of his business, I looked up in the sky and saw a 1/2 to 3/4 circle of lights that appeared to be flashing outside of or on the rim of a hazy circle.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing, have no idea what it was.  My daughter was awake, too, so I called her outside and pointed it out.  We watched it for about 5 minutes before I went inside to try to find a camera.  We're in the middle of moving and couldn't find one.  My daughter kept her eyes on it the entire time I was inside.  When I returned all but one of the lights had gone out or could otherwise no longer be seen.  We can still see that single light in the sky, sort of flashing or twinkling, but the hazy circle can't be seen now.;47.425;-122.4586

One dropped some fire.  40 sec apart They went by in pairs of two from a northerly to easterly direction.  They were light orange like fire and round in shape.  There was some fire that fell from one that made it not appear not to be a craft, though appeared to move as such.  Each set of two that totaled eight were about 40 seconds apart. The background of the witnesses have had no experience of prior hallucinations.  The witnesses have little knowledge of what they could have been as far as experience or training in things as such.;47.425;-122.4586
