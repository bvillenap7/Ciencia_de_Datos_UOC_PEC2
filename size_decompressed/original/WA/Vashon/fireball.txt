I was driving east on 112th St Sw on the north end of Vashon Island delivering newspapers.  From just below and to the north of Orion an extremely bright white light riveted my attention, and I watched it drop almost straight down --- slightly ENE --- disappering behind trees in the direction of the Seattle Space Needle.  The light was so bright it left a white trail momentarily.  I have seen many over the eight years I have been driving this route, but this was by far the brightest.  I reported this to 911 at 02:46.  They had not received any other calls at that time.;47.425;-122.4586
