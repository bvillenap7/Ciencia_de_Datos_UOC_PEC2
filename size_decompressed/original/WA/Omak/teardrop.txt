Started as one and then split up into four blinking red dots that were in a vertical line.  That circled around chasing after each other for over five minutes.  They combined and flew around the night sky making circlier shapes.  They moved accross the sky and split apart again.  The flying objects made a diamond shape and headed west.  They split up into a straight line and were out of view.  This lasted for about twenty minutes.;48.3602270270271;-119.586621621622
