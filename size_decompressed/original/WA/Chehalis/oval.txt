Hovering light moving in the distance randomly at high speeds, no abduction this time.;2005-12-08 05:30:00;40 minutes;Hovering light moving in the distance randomly at high speeds, no abduction this time. Clear early morning (0530), noticed a bright light in a direction southwest of my location that appeared to be a star or planet.  Observed object for 20 minutes after noticing it was randomly moving up to 5 degrees on the horizon at a high rate of speed.  Object omitted green and orange lights at a distance of several miles.  Went inside and informed 2nd witness who saw exactly what I saw.  After observing it for 40 minutes, went in and got the video camera.  When I came outside again the object was no longer there.  Did not reappear last night.  Freaked us out.;46.6382;-122.9658
oval shaped object zig zag slowly in sky and held still at times when still red and green lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD;2007-08-27 00:30:00;15 min;oval shaped object zig zag slowly in sky and held still at times when still red and green lights Noticed bright light out window.  Intermittently holding still, got brighter,  then zig zagged slowly in sky.  Heard low rumble sound as passed overhead.  Never seen anything move like that.  Got picture too--but not an expensive camera.  Awesome experience. When holding still had green and red lights. Then turned totally bright white for rest of duration of sighting.  Appeared to move slowly and wasn't real high in air. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD;46.6382;-122.9658
Silver object caught in photo.;2013-06-22 01:05:00;seconds;silver object caught in photo. Noticed a silver disc/oval in the sky in a photo i took. I was at a car show with my son and his girlfriend, taking photos of cars, I looked up at the sky, which had unusual, wispy clouds, and I snapped a photo with my cellphone. On monday as i was going through the snapshots i noticed the object in the sky. As I took the picture, we saw nothing moving in the sky at all, no planes, balloons, birds.. nothing.. we would have seen it, as we were gazing up at the sky.. I thought i had better report it and submit the photo in case there was some other corroborating evidence of a craft, radar or another report.;46.6382;-122.9658
Saucer spotted near Chehalis, WA.;2018-06-17 15:00:00;2 seconds;Saucer spotted near Chehalis, WA. While driving on pleasant valley (between Napavine and Adna area) road in Chehalis, Wa.m to the west of road about 100 feet off the ground was a saucer shaped craft that just disappeared away behind some fir trees only after a couple seconds.  It was very detailed as an airplane might be at that distance.  I could not hear a sound from it.  I had my air condition fan on.  Craft was oval shaped with a dome on top in the center of craft.  Looked grey color with no markings but it was only there for a couple seconds. Thanks;46.6382;-122.9658
