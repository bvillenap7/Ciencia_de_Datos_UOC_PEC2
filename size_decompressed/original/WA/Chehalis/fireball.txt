Giant comet like light.;2014-09-13 20:00:00;1 minutes;Giant comet like light My son and I were amazed to see a orb of light come from nowhere to the middle of the dark sky, we were traveling home from my sons football game  headed north on I-5 as the object appeared at the same time almost we both said, Did you see that? as we watched the object float across the sky then zip from east to west across the sky to finally disappear as quick as It first was seen..   Trying to use logic I thought it was a comet as it was a massive light, but it was able to almost control its movements, it was what any person who watched the sky would die to see, it was amazing and a once in a lifetime object that will never be forgotten!;46.6382;-122.9658
