Extremely loud rushing wind sound, swirling, slowing moving west.;2001-08-03 12:15:00;5 minutes;Extremely loud rushing wind sound, swirling, slowing moving west. An extremely LOUD rushing wind sound, like a Concord directly above us, moving south slowly.  There was no wind, just this very loud swirling noise.   No lights, it was overcast though.  It was so loud we expected the buildings to explode.  It continued south and faded after 5 or more minutes.   I have never heard anything like it.  It was not a plane, and this area is not known for tornadoes.  The roaring, swirling sound was astronomical, huge.;46.6382;-122.9658
Two bight white lights moving very slowly without sound;2005-02-08 19:15:00;10 15 minutes;Two bight white lights moving very slowly without sound February 9, 2005  On the evening of Feb 8th around 7:15 pm while talking with my mother on the phone, I saw some lights in the distance to the north of Chehalis I was looking north-east.  They were very bright white lights, I don’t recall seeing any colored lights, and they were moving slowly westward.  I went to look for my binoculars in another room, when I got back into the living room the lights were traveling in my direction.  I went out to the front porch to get a better look and try to hear the aircraft, they were moving very slowly, not like an airplane or helicopter, I thought maybe a blimp but couldn’t hear any sounds coming from the lights.  The lights passed in front of my neighbor’s house which is north of my position, their house being approximately 300 feet away.  How far the lights were in front of their house I have no idea, but they appeared to be right in front of if from my point of view.  The distance between the lights was the size of two of my fists held at arms length, and black in the center, in other words I couldn’t see anything in between the two lights, which led me to think maybe a blimp but still no sound what so ever.  Maybe it was two aircrafts flying side by side, each with one light on them, whatever it was all I could see was the light, not a shape of a craft or anything to describe how it looked.  I lost them behind the trees on our property, they were traveling west/southwest at the time and I didn’t spot them again on the other side of the trees.  My neighbors who live in the house described above were gone at the time and the other neighbors I talked to didn’t see it. ((NUFORC N;46.6382;-122.9658
Wobbly, starburst shape object moving across the sky;2008-08-02 22:00:00;30 seconds;Wobbly, starburst shape object moving across the sky 2 adults and one child enjoying a fire and looking at the night sky. We spotted a bright light, a starburst shape, that was high in the sky and moving in a SE direction. It was very bright at first. It was moving slowly in an erratic type motion, almost wobbling as it headed SE. It started to fade, then was just a spot of light. It turned red and then disappeared. At the same time we saw a meteor shoot across the sky, so it was markedly different than the meteor. We watched it for about 30 seconds.;46.6382;-122.9658
