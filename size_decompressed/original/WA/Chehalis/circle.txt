Awesome blue streak in the sky.;2015-04-12 02:30:00;A few seconds;Awesome blue streak in the sky Driving home last night on I-5 south out around Chehalis around 2:30 AM.  A beautiful brilliant blue streak raced across the sky.  Definitely don't think it was aliens or anything like that.  But it was an absolutely beautiful flash of blue unlike anything I've ever seen before.   The sighting lasted a matter of seconds like a shooting star before being gone.   One of the neatest things I've ever seen in the sky.;46.6382;-122.9658
A green circular shape about the size of an airplane sped off in the distance after about 4 seconds of watching it.;2017-07-29 21:58:00;4 seconds;A green circular shape about the size of an airplane sped off in the distance after about 4 seconds of watching it. Driving north, we noticed a green circular shape that appeared above the trees, on the east side of I-5 driving north.  Seemed to be 300-400 feet in the air, was a green light, and sped off to the north in an instant.  We only saw it for about 4 seconds, or so.  It seemed as big as an airplane.;46.6382;-122.9658
