While observing the Moon at 6:00 p.m., Saturday, Sept 10th, using an Orion Starmax 102mm EQ with a 25mm eyepiece, three lights in triangular formation crossed my field of view.  I followed them, skewing West, for a minute or two.  The formation changed according to the speed of the upper two lights.  I left the telescope to get a digital camera to record the event.  Upon returning, the lights were out of view, and I couldn't find them using the hour-angle adjuster, as before.  These lights were bright enough to stand out against a sunlit sky, as was the Moon at the time.  I could not see them with the naked eye.  These appeared as lights no discernable craft were observed.  This event occured after 6:00 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 10th, looking south from Gig Harbor, WA.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
