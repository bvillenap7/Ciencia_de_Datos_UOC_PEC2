Gig Harbor visitors and subsequent regression;1979-10-15 21:00:00;10 minutes;Gig Harbor visitors and subsequent regression  500 Lights On Object0: Yes This sighting occurred on Reid Dr NW, Gig Harbor, WA. during October 1979.  My wife and one year old daughter were with me at the time.  As we approached the harbor drive, I noticed a large silver ship hovering above the trees.  We stopped and watched if for a few moments until it followed the tree line down to the Harbor and headed off across Puget Sound towards Mt. Rainier.  This was the subject of a regression done in Kennewick, WA. in 2009.   These were red/browns that pulled us into the craft.  They stated that they were in the neighborhood and just stopped by to say hello. They expressed pleasure at the fact that I had settled down and started a family.  Amazing.  There were two in sight.  The smaller one that held me as a child and a larger entity that was more fully developed and seemed to be in charge.  They also stated that there was something out there in our future coming our way.  This was the first sighting that I remembered and when I underwent regression, the hypnotist instructed me to go to the first sighting that I have ever had.  That abduction occurred when I was eleven years old while living in Westmont, N.J.   I was being shadowed by a Silvery craft while walking in a park near where we lived.  It was silvery with brassy portholes and about 25 feet in diameter.  It was hovering over the trees.  I suddenly felt myself being sucked up a hose type device and landing near a wall/shelf in a corner of the craft.  Something was off to my left rear.  I was afraid and turned my head down and away.  It took my left wrist in its hand and attempted to see into my face.  It was a red/brown entity that was about an inch taller than me.  It was very nurturing and concerned that I had been interfered with.  I have never felt threatened by these entities.  Angry, yes, but not threatening.

All of the above accounts were of round, bright white lights;1999-06-01 01:00:00;hours;All of the above accounts were of round, bright white lights After hearing you on coast2coast last night I was moved to make my UFO report since you said it's never too late.  I had several sightings the summer of 1999. Since I worked the graveyard shift, on my nights off I would lay in my hammock out side as not to disturb my sleeping children.  The 1st night I focused on two very bright stars for at least an hour when off to my right I saw what I thought was a bright satellite approaching those stars. Without changing speed as soon as it had made a perfect triangle with the two stars they began moving with the third object and continued on it's path. Same speed, perfect triangle across the sky until I lost sight of them. I was and still am baffled.  The following week I saw what I believe to be airplanes (since there was a small airport not far off) with their landing lights on coming over the tree tops on a hill about 5 miles away it came straight toward me from the west a couple more miles then made a sharp right turn toward the north. Something an airplane could not have done, also the so called landing lights were still facing me. I watch until it left my sight behind trees. Only seconds later another object on the same path,same size, same lights did the exact same thing followed by a third, fourth and so on. This went on for at least 45 minutes. I lost count of how many there were.  At my parents house 5 miles south of those sightings back when I was a teenager about 1969-70 in the summer time, on a bright clear day my mom called my dad and myself to the front porch and pointed to the north to a very large star (brightest I have ever seen) We watched it as it stayed in the same spot for about 15 minutes and we discussing NEVER seeing a star during the day let alone that bright. All of a sudden it shot straight up at an incredible rate and was gone. It was then we realized it was too close to be a star ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Circular glowing craft.White yellowish color.Flying fairly low;2011-11-10 17:30:00;90 seconds;Circular glowing craft.White yellowish color.Flying fairly low In November of 2011, My helper and I (who work for a construction company) were approaching the Narrows bridge in gig harbor,WA, at approximatly 5:30 p.m when my helper noticed something in the sky.   I looked up and saw a circular shape object that appeared to have a glow around it.   Almost like a white/yellowish haze.  We both were stunned.I remember my hair standing up on my arms.   As we were looking at the object it went out of our site around some trees, and just a few seconds later we came around to see the other side of the trees in our truck and didn't see anything.   I want to mention that this object was not real high in the atmosphere.  Not sure what it was but the glow around it really amazed me.  Never seen anything like it again,nor will I or my helper ever forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Multiple white orb crafts were seen around my house for many years;2011-11-23 00:00:00;Hours;Multiple white orb crafts were seen around my house for many years I used to see multiple glowing orb crafts around my house when I was young, the sightings lasted for a couple years.  The glowing white orbs would either hover or dart about, and would be close together in pairs of 2 or 3 side by side.  There would be anywhere from 5-8 crafts outside at a time.  My father also would look at them with me, he worked for the air force and dismissed them to me as helicopters, but the way they moved, the amount, and location made no logical sense, as we live in a smaller town (around 8,000)  He has told me before that UFOS are real and I think he lied to me to not frighten me.  These orbs have reappeared recently again in the sky as I have had one sighting of them 1/13/2017 often after or during the sightings a low flying military plane would come overhead.  We have no big airports or military bases for miles. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Huge leading edge of circular craft seen over Gig Harbor, WA.;2015-08-08 04:15:00;1 min;Huge leading edge of circular craft seen over Gig Harbor, WA. Unable to sleep, I went and sat outside on the deck where I have a view from Gig Harbor, WA, looking east to Tacoma, near the Narrows Bridge. The sky at 4:10 was uniform with a high overcast.  The color of the sky was deep grey,..no stars showing through. I noticed a faint lightening in an area high over the water,...so i was looking intently as a bright arc came through part of the overcast...stayed there for approx 20 seconds, then withdrew or went back in cloud cover. I watched again in the same exact spot (two trees framed the spot so i know it was exact same spot) when the same thing repeated.  The sky lightened, the arc appeared and was huge.  To extrapolate from the arc, the craft must have been enormous. The normal aircraft that we see here are less than pea-sized at arms length.  The craft this morning was from index finger to thumb fully extended at arm's length. The arc was uniformly bright and sharply defined.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
I see several strange yellow orbs that hover over the Puget Sound almost every night.;2018-07-25 22:00:00;15 minutes;I see several strange yellow orbs that hover over the Puget Sound almost every night. I'm a friend of your nephew, that's how I learned about this site. I see these most nights.  They are little yellow orbs that flash red usually.  They appear from the East, hover over the Puget Sound and head north.  They don't use a logical flight path. They often fade in and out even without a cloud in the sky.  They aren't the color of stars and are very distinct from planes, helicopters or satellites.  It usually starts with one and then 2 or 3 join in as they slowly make their way East. I've made some video, although the quality doesn't show as with the naked eye.  I found one YouTube video of the same thing from this area but surprised they are hardly documented for how often they visit. Feel free to contact me for more information.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
