I saw my first UFO when I was on my way to school as a child.;1997-10-20 08:45:00;30 seconds to 1 minute;I saw my first UFO when I was on my way to school as a child. I've seen three different UFOs in my life. First when I was in elementary school, maybe 7 or 8 years of age. The first incident took place when I was on my way to school in the morning. I was the only kid at the back of the bus. It was a sunny day in my hometown. Through the emergency window, the large window-like door at the rear of the bus, I was watching the sky, when something of an anomaly caught my eye a bright object was flying in the sky, seemingly controlled by something as it moved. I can't exactly remember if it was following us, or if it was just moving around in one region in the sky. The only way I can describe it is that it was a large bright orb, almost like I was watching a miniature sun that was moving, and I could look at it without it burning my eyes or anything which, as a kid, or an adult for that matter, was and is quite impressive. It suddenly vanished (the whole event only took maybe 30 seconds to a minute) then came back, almo! st like a light turning off then turning back on. After another few seconds of watching it as we drove away, it vanished again, and I never saw it after that. Because I was the only one at the back of the bus and because everyone else was looking out the side windows in their own seat in the middle and front of the bus, I suspect I was the only one who saw it. I never told any of the other kids as I was quite shy in my childhood I'm sure you can imagine how hard it would be for a young and shy child to bring up UFOs.  At the time I didn't even know what UFOs were, to other kids.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Bright light seen over Hail's Passge up close!;2007-03-14 21:15:00;20 minutes;Bright light seen over Hail's Passge up close! My friend and I were in my hot-tub, when I noticed a very bright light. I called it to his attention and he looked at it through the high power binoculars. He noticed the shape it was, and it had two rows of bright lights. It also had a red light on bottom that would flicker! It seemed to be about 1,000ft  high and moved extremely slow.  A minute or two later, two military jets flew overhead. Provoking us in thought that it was a UFO. I have never seen anything like this in my life!;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Husband &I saw lights 45 mins, outside heard unearthly noise bounce around property.  3 year old says it's Yellow Man. 4 more events;2008-01-11 01:00:00;45 minutes;Husband &I saw lights 45 mins, outside heard unearthly noise bounce around property.  3 year old says it's Yellow Man. 4 more events My husband and I live in the woods and saw a light across the yard.  There are no neighbors or street lights, so we watched it.  To be brief we watched this light do a variety of movements and break into 2 up to 4 lights then move back into one again.  We went outside to investigate, there was no light.  Walking back into the house, we both suddenly heard a loud, sharp electronic sounding screech which went on for 40 or so seconds.  The sound stopped for 30 seconds then suddenly started on the opposite side of the property 100+ yards away.  This sound bounced back and forth 3-4 times till it stopped.  Our 3 year old daughter says we met the yellow man and she talks about it often.  We have had 4 other experiences 3 together, just as distinct yet even more detail and more interaction with the subject.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Bright White Light the Size and Brightness of Venus Passes Over Gig Harbor, WA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS.  PD));2009-07-03 01:58:00;9 Mins.;Bright White Light the Size and Brightness of Venus Passes Over Gig Harbor, WA On this morning, July 3rd, 2009 at approximately 0158 hrs., in Gig Harbor, Washington, I was standing outside smoking a cigarette, facing East and I looked up to my left because I saw movement and I saw a star as bright as, and about the size of, from my perspective, of Venus fly over from West to East. It was a bright white light. Made no sounds at all. Traveling faster then a jet fighter. I live in Gig Harbor and I have a good view of the Eastern sky. It took approximately 8-9 minutes for it to vanish into the deep horizon. I know this was not a satellite because it was much to bright and larger then a satellite. Satellites fades out after about 20 - 25% from it being directly over head. This never really faded out, it just got further and further away until it was past the horizon. I know what a satellite looks like as well as space junk. This was neither. It was hard to distinguish size and shape as well as altitude because it was too dark. But if I had to guess, I'd say it was 4-10,000 feet in the air. I often see aircraft on their flight path to Sea-Tac Airport but this object wasn't even in that pattern. The Tacoma/Pierce County Airport is nearby but there were no aircraft visible during this event at either Sea-Tac or Tacoma/Pierce County Airport. I am a trained observer. I served in the US Army as a Helicopter Mechanic and Crew Chief as well as taught Survival for my Unit. I am a Licensed Security Officer in the state of Washington.

Silent flying light, altitude higher than small local planes, flying east to west.  Yellowish-red. Smooth movement, not like a plane.  VERY CLEARLY NOT ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT.  Lasted a solid 40 seconds until in the distance the light faded to a redder shade and vanished. The guys around me are still freaking out about how completely real this whole thing was. Me too now. Thanks for your time. ((initials deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Possible hoax?  PD));47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Unusual stationary, elongated and bright light directly across Henderson Bay;2010-05-01 22:00:00;approx half hour;Unusual stationary, elongated and bright light directly across Henderson Bay Looking directly west over Henderson Bay from our second story living room window at about 10:00 tonight, my husband and I saw a light above the hills across the water that was different from starlight in shape, size and intensity.  It was a long distance away and difficult to make out, but looked elongated, almost like two lights, one atop of the other.  Unfortunately, couldn't find our adult binoculars and resorted to an old pair of toy binoculars...  when I looked through these from our driveway outside I noticed a similar light slightly above, distant from, and to the left of the big light straight ahead.  Through the toy binocs, the light periodically looked triangular in shape with a red center and white border (though this may have been a manifestation of the poor lenses).  My husband looked through and described the same color.  Both lights remained stationary for about half an hour until apparent cloud cover.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
I saw my second UFO ever shooting down to the ground and basically vanish or sink into the ground somehow.;2011-08-12 07:45:00;1 second;I saw my second UFO ever shooting down to the ground and basically vanish or sink into the ground somehow. The second UFO I've ever seen was a weird object that was witnessed by not only myself, but my cousin as well. It was still somewhat light out but getting darker by the minute. My cousin was driving and I was sitting in the passenger seat, dully gazing not out of my window, but rather the reflections of the lights of a store we were passing that was reflecting off my window.  This part is kind of ironic and amusing as, still looking at the reflections of the lights, I said to my cousin, Wow, for a split second, those lights looked like a..   Now, the amusing and ironic part is that had I finished my sentence, I'd have said, Wow, for a split second, those lights looked like a UFO.  That's because the reflection of the lights from the store we were passing did look like a large ship, although after that split second when I realized that it was in fact, just the reflection of the store lights, something shot down from the sky. We saw it outside through the front of the car, and the sighting caught me off guard and I didn't even finish talking. This was a light or orb-like object, made of a kind of LED-like light with a blueish tint however, it was so fast, that the sighting itself was only for a split second. It was somewhat funny actually, because my cousin asked if I saw that and I remember saying something along the lines of, “I'm not the only one who saw that? Good!” 	Besides it just being a light orb, the sighting played out like this: just as I was about to finish my sentence, my shock and surprise of the UFO made me hush up and my cousin and I watched as an LED-like ball of light – a large ball or orb mind you – randomly came out of the sky seemingly from nowhere, but instead of like the first UFO where it just kind of flickered in and out from nowhere, this one came flying from overhead, and it fell or shot down maybe three-hundred yards away from us and “vanished” before it hit the ground.  I put vanish in quotes because there was a solid concrete gate or fence blocking our view from the ground where it would have crashed, but because we couldn't see, we truly don't know what happened to this object if it had been any other object such as a plane, helicopter, jet or anything else, we were close enough to not only hear it crash but to see any flames or an explosion, but we saw nor heard any explosion or flames. On top of that, planes! , helicopters and jets don't just show up out of nowhere, aren't shaped like an orb or large circle, are not that fast as this thing was – even if they were falling to the ground! – and aren't made entirely of light. If it had been a shooting star, it would have had a tail, it wouldn't have looked like it was made of LED light, it would not have come out of nowhere, and one of that size and magnitude and one falling/crashing that close to us, would have had serious even fatal affects on my cousin and I, as in once again, we would have heard and seen an explosion and maybe would have even died from it.  That is why we think this thing either must have vanished right before it hit the ground, or somehow literally went into the ground.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Bright white light/red flashing disappeared behind two trees near Narrows Bridge, WA.;2013-11-01 22:20:00;5 minutes;Bright white light/red flashing disappeared behind two trees near Narrows Bridge, Wa Two witnesses saw a very bright white light through the trees, too large in presence to be a star.  As we approached the light, we noticed a red light was flashing next to it and that it was moving too slow to be a plane/we could not hear any noise (leading us to believe it was not a helicopter).  As we pulled into a clearing we witnessed the light(s) migrate behind two trees and we never saw it again.  The duration of this sighting was no longer than four to five minutes before it dissipated into the night sky.

First there was one and I thought it might be a low flying satellite, but it stopped directly overhead and moved slightly.  It was then followed by 2 then 3 more—stopping, repositioning, then getting fainter as if moving away.   They were silent, traveled very straight—no zigzagging, and seemed to reposition themselves in a precise manner.  Then the lights dimmed or grew fainter.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
