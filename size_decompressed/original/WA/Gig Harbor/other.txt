Hail's Passage (Between Gig Harbor Mainland and Fox Island)  The area is a frequent aircraft inbound route to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. We see bright lights all the time, but they move and it is clear to see the blinking lights of the aircraft and the descent and direction of the planes towards Sea-Tac.  I was in a hot tub with my friend, and he was looking at what was believed by him to be a bright star. He brought it to my attention and I moved to see what it was. It was no star at all. The object seemed to be around 1,000 ft, about a half mile away. It was extremely bright, almost like an incondensant light. It was so bright the deck was lit up outside. I got out and grabbed their high power binoculars and steadied my grip to get a clear view of the object.  I noticed five(5) distinct square lights on the side facing me. Underneath those five lights, there were four(4) more of the same style lights in the gaps beneath the upper lights. It was extremely bright all around the object, but I could make out where the object curved around from the shadow and where the lights ends on one side to the other. I then lost my grip and could not see another clear up-close view of the object.  I felt the feeling I was being watched, so I slowly put the binoculars back inside and returned to see the object finally drifting very slow behind the trees to the right of us. Not more than one minute later a very large military jet flew overhead towards the object, followed closely by a smaller fighter jet headed in the same direction. These two jets could easily have been scrambled by McChord Airforce Base, not fifteen miles away.  This further strengthened my belief this was a UFO of some sort. There have been more and more reports around the Puget Sound lately. I have heard other reports of this same object on the same night from Fox Island too.

Maybe I witnessed my friend's soul being taken away.;2017-03-25 18:00:00;5 minutes;Maybe I witnessed my friend's soul being taken away. Well it had been a week since my dog got ran over by a delivery guy.  A tragic death of my best friend of 13 years.  She was a border collie.   I was standing on the front porch of my house ,a fairly wooded area, looking at the yard.  The sun was going down ,all of a sudden 2 pairs of 2 vertical blue orb like eyes about 10 feet off the ground came around the back side of the house.  It seemed to me that they were two individuals.   Because when they came closer to me one of them began to bounce up and down while the other one was stationary.  They were about 20 feet from me.  My hair stood up on end.  It was freaking me out I couldn't move.   Well, after about 5 minutes of awe, they moved off behind the wood shed, never to be seen again.  There was no way that it was some kind of reflection, or laser.  They were just pure deep orbs.  What I saw I will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is reporting accurately.  PD));47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
High Altitude balloon at 50,000 feet MSL.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a high-altitude, helium-filled research balloon??  PD));2020-04-17 11:00:00;10 minutes;High Altitude balloon at 50,000 feet MSL Hello Mr. Davenport,  At approximately 11 am Pacific 1800 GMT from our backyard in Gig Harbor, WA, we saw an object high and to the west reflecting silver in the sunlight.  It appeared to be 50,000 ft+ MSL altitude and drifting from west to east.  I assume it was somewhere over the southern Olympic Peninsula.  I went into the house and got my camera with a telephoto lens and took a closer look and it revealed to be something like a high altitude research balloon. I am a professional pilot with 50+ years in commercial aviation and 17000 hours of flight time.  I send this to you so as to give my opinion of what I saw in case you receive similar reports of this object in the sky. I look forward to your weekly reports on Coast to coast AM.  But, I am a little bummed out in that I thought this was going to be my first ever UFO sighting. Best regards,;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
