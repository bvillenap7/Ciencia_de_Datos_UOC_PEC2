back in 93;1993-06-01 16:00:00;2 min;back in 93 I can't say for sure what exactly I saw.  I'm not going to say that it is an alien spacecraft, but that is the closest I can come to describing it, or them. Actually, when I was about 10, me and my brothers where out walking along the road.  We noticed two strange metal objects off in the distance up in the air.  The strongest point I remember about this was that they made NO sound, whatsoever.  We witnessed them fly towards us, then slow way down.  THe two disk shaped objects seemed to have lights all around the edge of it.  I can't remember for sure how large they were.  But they completely stopped about fifty feet above the tree line above us.  At this point, we all were about to crap our pants, so we ran as fast as we could to our home, and refused to go back outside for hours.  My mother never believed us.

From a distance of 3 miles,  I saw two silver colored suacer-shaped objects engaged in aerobatics  before disappearing into a cloud;2000-04-15 13:45:00;30 seconds;From a distance of 3 miles,  I saw two silver colored suacer-shaped objects engaged in aerobatics  before disappearing into a cloud The two objects I witnessed were silver in color and saucer-shaped.  The weather that day was mostly sunny with clouds at about 3000 to 4000ft. I first noticed them flying about two miles south of Tacoma Narrows Airport runway 17.  Both of the saucer-shaped craft were flying together but looked as though they were engaged in a 'dog-fight' because they seemed to be chasing each other and doing aerobatics while ascending and descending rather quickly.  I would estimate their speed at between 400 and 450 mph.  At that time there were no aircraft in their immediate vicinity. Throughout the duration of the sighting both objects seemed to stay in a very small area, perhaps no larger then a square mile.  As I watched the two objects, I knew from my experience in aviation that they were not any type of aircraft  I've ever seen.  I can identify almost any military, commercial, or private aircraft that could be found flying in this country and what I saw was like nothing I've ever seen.  I should mention that at the time I was working at the airport fueling planes and for the last fifteen years years I've been interested in aviation and I know what kind of flight characteristics a small plane or even a military or commercial jet can do.  And the way the way these objects were flying tells me that they weren't any conventional aircraft.  I should also mention that the objects made no sound.  And finally, I lost sight of the objects when they both flew into a large cloud which tells me they weren't any type of bird or remote-controlled airplane because of the height of the clouds and my viewing distance.  When they disappeared they were at least 3 miles away so I would estimate their size at between 50 and 75 feet in diameter.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
