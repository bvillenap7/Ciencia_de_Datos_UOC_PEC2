UFO sighting Gig Harbor Washington Nov. 14 1997.  ((NUFORC Note:  Many, many reports of this dramatic event.  PD));1997-11-14 21:00:00;4-5 minutes;UFO siting Gig Harbor Washington Nov. 14, 1997. I was traveling to Gig Harbor from Spokane, WA, Nov. 14, 1997 with my two children when I saw the lights.  It was a group of 5 or more large orange lights moving in a linear & uniform fashion quite quickly across the horizon.  I slammed on the brakes & got out of the car as I thought they may be missles and that this was the beginning of some sort of hostility.  The objects made no sound & were a spherical meets missile shape.  The thing I noticed most was that there seemed to be a definite trajectory to the movement.  Even as I recall this event nearly 14 years later, it seems like yesterday. ((NUFORC Note:  Many, many reports of this dramatic event.  PD));47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
