Triangle shaped object seen west of Tacoma.;2002-05-08 21:10:00;8-10 seconds;Triangle shaped object seen west of Tacoma. I was driving north bound on a quiet road when I noticed three white lights in the sky ahead of me.  I stopped the car and watched them fly northwest until they disappeared behind a forest of trees.  The three lights seemed to be connected.  They did not blink, flicker or change color, but remained white.  There also was a flash of light coming from the left side of the object.  It was white also and flashed like a strobe light at regular intervals.  I could not see where the source of the flashing light.    If I held up my thumb at arms length, it would not have covered the object. I have never seen anything like this before. I am a writer and amature astronomer.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Triangular white lights with smaller red and blue strobing lights near the white lights.;2003-07-23 00:58:00;2 minutes;Triangular white lights with smaller red and blue strobing lights near the white lights. Driving west on Sehmel Dr.N.W. and saw an object in the sky just above the tree line. Could not see a shape because it was too dark, but it had three bright lights in a triangular shape with red and green smaller strobing lights adjacent to the white lights which would flash about every five seconds. The object dissapeared into the tree line.  I pulled into my driveway and rolled the windows down to hear a motor to see if it was a helicopter, an airplane, or possibly the Goodyear blimp which was in Everett very recently.There was no noise. I pulled in front of my garage and shut the motor off. There was still no noise. The object must have been at low altitude and was moving at slow speed like a blimp or helicoper would. If the object was further away it would have to be very large and the lights very bright. Again no silouete of an object could be seen because of the dark sky and bright lights.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
strange blue and red colored stars turn into a ufo triangle that twitches and shoots out 'stars';2006-07-17 03:00:00;30 minutes;strange blue and red colored stars turn into a ufo triangle that twitches and shoots out 'stars' i was star gazing with my girlfriend when we started to notice that there were a lot of satellites out than normal.  some were going way faster than usual.  some were changing direction randomly.  from what i know, a normal satellite goes one direction and one constant speed and doesnt change.  this night was different.  then, we saw two stars (one red, one blue) that were right next to each other, almost touching.  they started to twitch very strangly.  we also noticed that there was another star that started flashing very near the two other stars.  the flashing one moved in a curved way towards the other two and joined them to create a triangle.  the triange of stars started to move in a rocking horse sort of way... i dont really know how else to put it.  it looked as if it was either spinning or spiraling and it moved very smoothly and gently wherever it went.  after about 15 minutes or so, it turned into one star and shot out 3 stars from it.  the three stars would dissapear almost right after being shot out.  then the star would turn into a triangle again and started to spiral.  during the 30 minutes of this experience, satellites would fly directly toward this triangle and sort of dissapear in it.  i would most definately not believe it if i read/heard this from someone, but since i saw it, there is no denying it.  the last part of it is creepy.  the triangle shot out a dark star that shot straight up into the sky and it obviously wasnt a star for us, because it had big black wings the it flew away with!  i thought that i was going to wake up after i saw this, but it was definately real.  it flapped a couple of times and then dissapeared in the middle of the night sky.  i am still freaking out about this.  during the 30 minute experience of this event, i was having uncontrollable convulsions and had no idea what to think of it.  before this, i laughed at the thought of ufo's.  now i dont even want to think about it.

Triangle shaped craft fly over;2007-08-23 23:17:00;10 sec;On August 23, 2007 at 23:17 hrs my son and I were watching TV when we heard the sound of a P&W Turbofan engine.  My son went outside to look and saw a black triangle- shaped craft fly over going East to West at about 500 to 1000 ft. It had white lights on three corners.  We live by military installations and we believe it was an F117.  Since the Russian-Chinese joint Military exercises we have had F15s with full afterburner striking to the West, but have never seen an F117 before.  It’s hard to say what’s going on in the night skies over the Pacific Northwest.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Medium sized triangular shaped craft hovered and shot off extremely fast;2007-11-02 21:15:00;5 - 10 seconds;Medium sized triangular shaped craft hovered and shot off extremely fast We were in Gig Harbor Washington. Looking East from shore of the bay I saw a triangle with lights. The corners were acute and sharp.  There was a very bright white light in the center of the triangle.  The three corners each had a light.  The craft was a perfect triangle, yet it's west pointing corner had a red light. This appeared to be the leading edge as it moved from East to West.  The south corner had a blue light and the north light had a green light.  It was 9:10-9:15 PM.  It was dark and cloudy.  The size of the craft I would say was about half the size of a jet liner.  I was below the cloud cover which was perhaps 1 mile away.  When I first saw it, it was moving west from over the bay to over land a few hundred feet then stopped immediately. It stayed still for only about three seconds.  Then it went straight up very fast a hundred or two hundred feet.  It stopped immediately and stayed there for only one second or so, then it shot off to the west and because I was in a car and the west view was obstructed by a hill (and the roof of the car), I couldn’t see it again.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Bright lights/craft observed flying low over highway.;2013-08-22 20:45:00;1-2 minutes;Bright lights/craft observed flying low over highway. Driving east bound on highway 16 before the first Purdy exit nearing Gig Harbor on 8/22/13 around quarter til 21:00.  Lights were at around a 50 degree angle ahead of me, flying towards me (heading north). They started as two very bright lights, close together like headlights on a car about as wide as the full moon in the sky. I continued to observe the lights for about a mile and a half down the highway (I was driving 65 mph) as I got closer and it larger until it passed directly over my head. There were the two bright lights I witnessed on either side of the craft, with white lights visible underneath and another white light at the nose of the craft.  I witnessed one flash of blue light near one of the white lights.  It appeard triangular in shape, but it was after dusk so the shape was difficult to distinguish. After it passed over me I lost sight of it because I was driving. Wind was blowing WSW 1G08 at 249 ft. elevation.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
