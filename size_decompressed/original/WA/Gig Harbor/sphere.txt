Most of our viewing was out of our peripheral vision. Description: Round circular/sphere like object approx. the size of a small grapefruit with a dull orangish color.  It seemed to move in an arch like manner very fast yet fluid in motion. It flew around the neighborhood houses and tree line for several minutes.  Then right before it disapeared it flew through my legs. As it flew between my legs I got a glimpse of of an intense light inside it. Observers: I am a self employed publisher of a medical directory for six counties.  My friend is a second grade teacher.;47.3204564356436;-122.607657425743
Multi-colored sphere hovering over Seattle;2009-09-11 21:00:00;1+ hour;Multi-colored sphere hovering over Seattle Date: 9/11/2009 Time: 9:00p – 10:00p Conditions: Spectacularly clear night. Viewing Location: Gig Harbor, Key Peninsula, WA  Sighting Summary: The night was spectacularly clear and my family and I were out looking at the stars when my youngest child observed a flashing multi-colored object hovering roughly 5° above the horizon and 10° NE off true north.  It seemed to be generally over Seattle, directly to the east of the Bangor submarine base on the Kitsap Peninsula.  It hovered in roughly the same location for over an hour, however it drifted slightly to the east over the timeframe we observed it. From our viewing location, the object was small and difficult to observe with the naked eye so we used a pair of 10X25 Binoculars for improved detail.  The colors alternated fairly quickly between red, green, purple, aqua blue, violet, dark blue, orange, yellow, and white and appeared like electrical arcs surrounding a sphere. There was a fair amount of air traffic that evening but it didn’t seem to draw much attention which I thought was strange.
