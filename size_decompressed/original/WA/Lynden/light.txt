Our parents and siblins were already in their rooms. My sister and I (around 12 and 14 yrs old) were looking out my upstairs window watching what we at first thought was a airplane that was fairly close to our house, but there was no sound.  It seem to move quite slowly and we both stood in silence as we watched it, then all of a sudden it just stopped and it shot this beam of light straight up into the sky as though it was searching for something above it, the light moved back and forth straight above it.  At this point we began to scream at the same time as we tore down the stairs at the same time running into our parents bedroom sreaming for our father, we ran to our parent side of their bed as they were reading.  Our hands shaking  and not sure if we should cry or scream more, we all, the whole family ran outdoors to see but it was gone.  In that area there was nothing to interfere with viewing the whole sky, but there was nothing there, it was just gone.  To this day my sister and I talk about this and still get chills.  I have never seen anything like this since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));48.9366;-122.4576

There was no defined form just lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));48.9366;-122.4576
Odd light in the sky;2009-07-01 22:05:00;10 secs;Odd light in the sky I was in my backyard on the phone with my friend. I looked up and saw a a light traveling north to south. I thought that it was a plane, but it seemed to high to be a plane. I have worked in the travel industry for my entire adult life and I am well versed in aircraft and flight paths and this didnt fit either of those. After a few seconds the light slowed down considerably and then grew very bright. Once the light's brightness reached its peak, the light started moving up at a 45-55 degree angle and then the light started to dim and after a few more seconds, the light disappeared completely. I told my friend who I was on the phone with what I saw and that I couldnt believe it! Anyway, that was what happened. It was odd to say the least! And I must mention, that when it happened, it was still very light outside! There were only the two brightest stars visible in the sky. And the light that I saw was very bright and then just disappeared!  It was truly bizarre!;48.9366;-122.4576
Northwest Washington: light descends rapidly from within Big Dipper, varies its course playfully, then disppears over Canada.;2010-08-26 02:00:00;90 seconds;Northwest Washington: light descends rapidly from within Big Dipper, varies its course playfully, then disppears over Canada. I was dozing in my backyard when a minivan drove by and woke me up.  I had been looking at the stars, particularly the big dipper, before I fell asleep and happened to look at it again above the minivan.  A large light, larger than the stars which compose the big dipper, but appeared almost as distant, streamed through the constellation at a very high rate of speed.  I thought it might have been a shooting star, but it wasn't moving fast enough.  Once it reached a spot below the big dipper the light dimmed slightly, and then moved back and forth (left and right) in its descent, almost playfully, before taking a straight course again and I eventually lost it over what I believe was Canada.  It was heading a due north course.  The color was white, the shape was round, and the object moved and dimmed. This was not a plane.  As soon as I saw it I knew what it was.

While sitting in hot tub we observed 35 lights moving from W to SE.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-17 20:40:00;15 minutes;While sitting in hot tub we observed 35 lights moving from west to southeast. Watched with powerful binoculars. They appeared to be very high as if they were among the stars. They traveled  in a straight line at equal distances apart. They basically traveled from horizon to horizon in about 20-30 seconds. With the binoculars you could see them  flicker and zigzag as they moved.;48.9366;-122.4576
