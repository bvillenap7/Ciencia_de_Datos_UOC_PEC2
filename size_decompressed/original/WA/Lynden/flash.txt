I just saw this beautiful strike that must have came down from the cloud line.  Nearly straight down. I was heading east between Lynden Everson areas.  The line came a bit north east of where I was on Hampton.  The light was vivid and may have lasted three beats.  Sort of like a comet tail and kind of like a firework.  Yet nothing of those sorts at all. As I observed this illuminated line was in the distance and took up about 5 inches of my window.  The main body of it was a dark neon green with a slight border of red.  The head of this strike was bright and more of a color of light.;48.9366;-122.4576
