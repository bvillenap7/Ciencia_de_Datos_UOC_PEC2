I'm in law enforcement and was on duty.  I was sitting on the roof of my jeep watching an area known for smuggling with a hand held thermal device.  I happened to look up and noticed a cylinder shaped object flying low in the sky.  The object had two solid lights and no running lights like an aircraft.  The sighting took place near abbots ford airport in bc Canada.  There were numerous aircraft flying in and out of the airport all with running and blinking lights on them.  This one had none.  I attempted to look at it with the thermal device and there was absolutely no heat source where the UFO was in the sky.  I then aimed it at the other aircraft in the area and they showed up on the device.  I them aimed the device back at the object and still no heat source could be seen on the thermal device.  The object slowly moved eastward and finally disappeared out of view.;48.9366;-122.4576
