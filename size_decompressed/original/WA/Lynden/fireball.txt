My husband walked me to my car.   While enjoying the big beautiful moon, we noticed something that was bright red/orange.  Our first reaction was that a hot air balloon was in the sky but we decided it was going to fast.  It was moving from south west to North east (I think, not good with directions).  When it reached the big dipper it disappeared.   We watched for several minutes (about 5-7 min) and saw 6 of these flying the same flight pattern one at a time and disappearing when reaching the dipper.;48.9366;-122.4576
