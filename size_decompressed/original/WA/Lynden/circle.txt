It was difficult to see exactly where it was because it was inconsistent when we tried to look directly at it.  The lightning had no sounds of thunder afterwards as there weren't any clouds in the sky either.   My daughter woke up shortly after we saw the first flashes from a bad dream and noticed there was a blue flashing orb in the sky.  I gave her binoculars and had her point it out to us.  My wife and I saw a sky full of stars but no blue up where she was pointing.   I then got out our digital SLR camera and took a few shots where she was pointing and saw exactly what she was describing.  My wife and I were unable to see it but my daughter and the camera picked it up.  My daughter also noticed about 8 red/blue lights coming from the vicinity of the blue one heading towards to lighting near the foothills.   I took photos of the sky where she said they were but still my naked eye couldn't see what she saw however the camera did.  This went on for over an hour or two.  She also saw the stars squeeze and pull tight in a spot in the sky similar to what a black hole or worm hole is described.;48.9366;-122.4576
