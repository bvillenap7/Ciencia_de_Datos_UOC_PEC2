Swarm of 6-8 lights, stationary for 5-6 minutes, then receded slowly into the distance.;2019-01-13 05:00:00;~10 minutes;Swarm of 6-8 lights, stationary for 5-6 minutes, then receded slowly into the distance. January 13, 2019.  This morning I woke about 5:00 AM.  I looked out the windows and was startled to see a long, horizontal line of lights.  The lights were equally spaced.  I had never seen anything like that before, and sat up to get a better look.  I watched the lights fo 5-6 minutes, then I turned over, and when I turned back the lights were receding into the distance staying in a straight line.;48.1077;-122.7945

One morning last week, I think it was April 2, I was lying awake in bed about midnight. Looking out the window at the Salish Sea, I saw 2 bright red lights in the sky.  They were above and parallel to the water. The lights were a short distance apart.  As I watched I saw a red beam come from between the two lights and down to the beach in front of my house.  I think the red beam was a laser beam.  As I watched the red beam disappeared, and the two lights faded into the distance. I have seen bright lights in the sky before but did no report them.;48.1077;-122.7945
