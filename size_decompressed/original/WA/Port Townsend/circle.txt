My husband and daughter were flying two separate kites and I decided to lay on the grass directly under them and take photos because the sky was amazing!  The cloud formations and sun would make for a stunning bavk drop.  I took multiple pictures within a 5 min period and did not see the white orb like structure until a couple days ago when I finally looked back at my photos I had taken.  Out of 23 photos 6 photos show a white orb to the right of our kites.  We did not see them at the time of taking pictures because quite frankly the sun was blinding when I snapped them.  I showed them to a fellow we met at the fireworks show on the 4th and he was blown away and a follower of this site and insisted I submit them to be debunked.  If you notice in the pictures that I'm sending in exact sequence as they were taken, they show up in different locations slightly.
