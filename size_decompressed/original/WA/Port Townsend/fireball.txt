My friend and i saw a bright object that looked like a planet or a star, but was way too bright to be either, even venus.;2001-07-12 01:24:00;10 minutes;My friend and i saw a bright object that looked like a planet or a star, but was way too bright to be either, even venus. My friend and i are two students in the 9th grade. We both get good grades. Anyways, i woke up and looked out the window. I noticed there was a bright star like thing. I woke my friend up so he could see the object. We both knew that it was way too bright to be a star or a planet, and that it was way too late for it to be Venus. We both looked at the object, which from far away looked white. We had an old handheld telescope which we looked at it with. And close up it looked greenish reddish with a dark spot in the middle. After a few minutes. the object started to slowly turn on and off almost. It would fade really dim and then go way bright. While doing this, the object started to slowly head up, out of the atmosphere we guessed. It slowed down even more, became more bright, and shot straight up, out of sight.

Giant Blue-Green fireball falls from the sky at 0530 in washington state;2002-10-01 05:30:00;8-10 seconds;Giant Blue-Green fireball falls from the sky at 0530 in washington state I was at the marina getting ready to launch my boat and out of no where in the sky there was a blue-green ball falling from the sky moving to the east.  None of the guys i was with say it because they were looking at me with the surprised look on my face...   When i got home at 4pm i told my wife about it and we started pondering it.  Then we watched the 5 o clock news and they said there were alot of calls reporting a fireball falling from the sky and they didnt have an answer except maybe a meteor but this thing was bigger than any meteor ive ever seen. From where i was it looked about the same size as the moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor.  Many other reports.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Peter From where I was at it looked to be falling from the southwest toward the north towards Canada but if you asked for my estimate I would say it landed in the Strait of Juan de Fuca  It was falling at a 45-50 degree angle and when I first saw it I thought some one from Port Townsend Shot a huge green flare because it looked so close.  It really didnt seem very far from me.  At the time the size of it looked to be about the same size as the moon.  And it seemed to move alot slower than a meteorite.  actually looked like a flare falling slow to the ground.  This morning I was at the same place and at the same time I saw a shooting star in the same place at the same time except it was the usual size.  Tiny but fast.  If you have any questions I would like to help out.  ((END)) ((SECOND FOLLOW-UP)) It was to the west of me going north,. ((END));48.1077;-122.7945
A  very bright object  was seen moving rapidly in the western sky;2007-12-05 21:30:00;3 seconds;A  very bright object  was seen moving rapidly in the western sky We saw a bright sustained flash (3 seconds) falling rapidly in the western sky.  It seemed like an LED type of light in intensity and tint (bluish).  We were in a dark place in a parked car overlooking a bay when this occurred.  It was bright enough that the hood and dashboard of the car was illuminated.;48.1077;-122.7945
Aug. 2nd, near Port Townsend, WA.  6 second, huge expanding flame/fire--massive and suddenly disappeared.;2015-08-02 23:35:00;6 seconds;Aug. 2nd, near Port Townsend, WA.  6 second, huge expanding flame/fire--massive and suddenly disappeared. Aug. 2, 2015/2335 hrs.  Huge Explosion in the North East sky, viewed from 12 miles south of Port Townsend, WA. (48.03.23 N.Lat.)  An immense explosion occurred low on the horizon, above what appeared to be Whidbey Island (US Navy Base).   There appeared an (apparent) ground/sea based (Laser ??) instantaneous streak upward (approx. 45 degrees) just prior to an enormous sky explosion - lasting approx. 6 seconds - of  red/orange/yellow fire-flame expanding in height and width.  No smoke or steam, and not even remote trailing or falling debris, as in a SAM (Surface to Air missile) or from an aircraft collision.  Nor was there a SAM tail or winding search of such.   This was an enormous red/orange “FIRE,” expanding all consuming explosion the visual lasting approximately 6 seconds.  And then in an instant disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.  PD));48.1077;-122.7945
