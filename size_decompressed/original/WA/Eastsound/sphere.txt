PD);2004-10-11 22:30:00;long;like a bright star, only spins  slowly and has white and red (sometimes orange and green) lights This sphere has been in our night sky regularly for many months! The first time we witnessed it was probably sometime in April.  It appears to be a bright star with a notable exception it slowly spins. There seem to be colored lights on it red and white predominate sometimes orange and green appearas well. The first night, it moved in tight little formations like a diamond or it would bounce up & down repeatedly.  It was in the western sky just above treeline at sea level. It has since become commonplace to us, almost like a benevolent presence.  We have seen it many times, and it is visible most nights.  I have seen it glide across the sky in the west, moving from south to north, gliding silently.  It seems mostly to hover and spin, and it makes no sound.  For the past month or so, it has been in the low north-northeast sky.  Several of us go outside to look at it regularly.  I have been wanting to report this for some time, because I find it fascinating but I guess I felt foolish and tried to rationalize it as a balloon or a satellite, even though I know it is not.  I have seen it in outdoor events here where there were many people (outdoor parties and such).  I do not drink or do drugs although had I seen this without other witnesses, I may have thought I was crazy.  It is always pretty low in the sky.  I wonder if there is some kind of rational explanation for what it is. If so, I'd really like to know. I wonder how many others have seen or reported something like this. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a twinkling star, although that is just a guess.  PD));48.6932;-122.9073
