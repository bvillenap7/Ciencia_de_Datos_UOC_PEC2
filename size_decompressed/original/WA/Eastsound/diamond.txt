5-7 star shaped craft spotted in the San Juan Islands.;2015-11-25 05:55:00;~20 minutes;5-7 star shaped craft spotted in the San Juan Islands I woke from sleep to go to the bathroom, upon returning to my bed I looked out my windows and saw a strange sight in the sky.  I was staying on the north shore of Orcas Island, and across the strait is Sucia Island.  The objects appeared to be over Sucia island.  It should also be noted that there was a wind storm happening with regular gusts of 60 mph+ and all of the lights in the house were off, we live outside of town, so there isn't much in the way of artificial light to begin with.  I saw two red lights not far from the ground, maybe 10 stories up, like a radio tower, so I dismissed them, but above those lights at about 3 or 4 times the distance above, were between 5-7 large objects. They were diamond or star shaped, think the traditional 4 pointed star, bright and firey golden yellow, its hard to explain because they seemed to be twinkling and almost dripping fire or sparks or something along those lines.  They moved lazily among each other, none of them ever moving too far from one another making it hard to determine just how many singular craft there were.  Nothing too spectacular happened, other than them being there in the first place.  After about 20 minutes they disappeared. The next evening looking out at the island, I was trying to spot the radio towers, but they were not there, so the red lights were another aspect of the event itself.;48.6932;-122.9073
