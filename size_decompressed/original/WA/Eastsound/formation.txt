2 unidentified high-wing large model aircraft flying low over water proceeding south along west side of East Sound.;2013-10-06 15:20:00;~2 minutes;2 unidentified high-wing large model aircraft flying low over water proceeding south along west side of East Sound. While leaving downtown Eastsound, proceeding west on Orcas Rd., I happened to look south, as I had a view over the water.  I saw what appeared to me to be two rather large model aircraft (I say model, as they had a wingspan of maybe 10’±).  The lead aircraft was flying along the west shoreline, with the second behind and to the left.  Both were dark-colored, had no floats/pontoons attached, but were flying an estimated 20’ off the water.  High-wing configuration. They disappeared around a change in the shoreline, and by the time I turned the car around to stay in sight of them, they had left my ability to see them further. Time, about 3:20pm, Sunday, October 6. I talked with the Orcas Radio-Control Aircraft Society, and none of them were aware of anyone flying overwater that day. This is my first report to this website.  Generally, I have good estimation abilities on this sort of thing I’ve been the airport manager for the Orcas Island Airport for 10+ years and have seen a lot of aircraft in all attitudes and altitudes, and this one is a mystery to me.;48.6932;-122.9073
