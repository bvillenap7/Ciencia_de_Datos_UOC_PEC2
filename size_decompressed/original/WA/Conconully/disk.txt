Saucer-shaped object appeared to move across sky quickly in rural Washington  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible bird in flight.  PD));2004-06-13 12:28:00;5 seconds;Saucer-shaped object appeared to move across sky quickly in rural Washington On Sunday I took a couple of panorama pictures of my boyfriend in front of Starvation Mt. & Granite Mt while hiking with our dogs to the top of the Funk Mountain Lookout, just north of the Town of Conconully, Washington.  I was looking west (slightly NW?) while taking the pictures with a Cannon A300 digital camera.  We did not notice anything until we got home.  The fist picture shows something in the clouds to his right.  The second photo shows something against the mountains to his left.
