I saw a long patch of white behind the tree tops and thought it was a comet but it did not streak out from the trees. Then it slowly started moving into the open sky. It stood out as the brightest thing in the sky. Like neon light tubing. The tube inside the fuzzy light looked like a jet airline body. No wings or tail, and as long as a plane .There were black archtop spots across the lower half. Close together with white between them. the object was a dull white on the upper half , and around the dark spots. This is NO joke . I could clearly see it !!!  It came over the campground area and moved off to the east . no noise,just coasting along.They were not hiding it at all. WITH MY OWN EYES. It is true. It moved off over the Okanogon Reservation glowing bright. IF anyone else saw it please speak out.Conconully to OMAK area WOW!;48.5469;-119.7526
