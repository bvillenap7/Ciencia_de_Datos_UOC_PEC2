I was closing the blinds at approximately 2230 hours around mid September, 2007, when I noticed a bright light approximately 300 feet above the ridge line to the NE of the town of Orting.  I initially thought it was the landing light of an approaching military airplane since they fly frequently above the house in the day time and at night.  However, this light hovered and did not come closer.  Suddenly the light shot straight into the sky.  The object moved with incredible speed and without a sound in a curved trajectory toward the east.  The object continued into the sky until it was as small as one of the distant stars and appeared like one of the many moving dots one can observe across a night sky.

Orange balls in the sky very bright;2011-07-24 23:03:00;4 min;Orting, WA.    July 24, 2011  I witnessed Sunday night about 11:05 bright orange lights through my window. I ran outside to see what it was. I saw 5 orange balls in the sky very bright they were staggered apart as they went by. 1 went into the clouds, 1 went behind the tree line, 3 faded out after they had passed over us to the east.  When they faded I could see a small white blinking light on top of them as they headed east. Then a group of four came up from behind them, and we watched them go by in the same direction. My husband got the camera and snapped pictures of the last group. They were going west to east moving very slow.  They were much bigger than the stars, about 5 times bigger than the largest star out there.  They looked to be only as high as a small plane would fly over.  They seemed to be in the same path as the military planes fly. It was a clear night with some low cloudy patches.;47.0879;-122.1879
Orange lights near Orting, Wa.;2011-07-24 23:03:00;4 min;Orange lights near Orting, Wa. What I saw: Two separate groups of round orangeish yellow lights. There were five in the first group, four in the second. As the first group disappeared the second group appeared. They were traveling from the west to the east.  They maintained a constant speed and altitude, absolutely silent.  Also they were not in any recognizable formation. It was approximately 11:05 PM so it is difficult to determine how far away they were or the altitude.  There were broken clouds in the sky, and as they traveled east the orange color dimmed and went out and some disappeared into the clouds.;47.0879;-122.1879
Bright light in western sky;2011-08-01 01:00:00;2 hours;Bright light in western sky Four individuals and myself were enjoying the meteor shower on august 12th-13th.  Heads and eyes towards the skies, I noticed an orange light in the western direction. I mistook it as a planet because it was a solid light... and not blinking... at the time. An hour passes by, and that light has moved a little down towards the horizon... and now is blinking between white and red... like a star would... Except its rocking back and forth in a horizontal pattern... I got the attention of a friend and asked for a second opinion... he agreed that it was indeed rocking back and forth VERY subtle. Another 30 minutes goes by... and that light has now traveled down towards the horizon RIGHT above the trees. It has moved FAR too fast to be a star or planet... and is still rocking back and forth... it got the attention of the rest of the people around us. We decide to try and communicate... we flash the LED flash on the back of an iPhone in a strobe pattern... and the light starts to move back and forth faster... until it just goes out. It was my first UFO sighting. Please tell me if this is a mistake...;47.0879;-122.1879
While sitting in our living room looking out the picture windows in the direction of Mt. Rainier in Washington S. ((Sirius??));2013-01-16 20:04:00;1+ hour;January 16,2013 8:04pm   While sitting in our living room looking out the picture windows in the direction of MT Rainier in Washington State, we noticed a flickering light.  After watching this light and it not moving like a plane or helicopter we looked through our binoculars and saw the light changing colors! Red, green, blue, white. We then tried to look at the light through our video camera, and our camera.  We have some footage upon request.  The object seemed to be flickering/bouncing around and changing colors. I believe I saw this same light/object 3 nights ago but did not take much interest. This went on for an hour or more, it seemed to be moving higher in the sky slowly. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses may have been looking at Sirius.  PD));47.0879;-122.1879
