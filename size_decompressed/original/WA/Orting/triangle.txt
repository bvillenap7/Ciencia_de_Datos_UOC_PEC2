The second sighting in my life in the same spot.;2016-01-23 02:30:00;5 minutes;The second sighting in my life in the same spot. On 1-23-2016, I and four others were pulling into my drive way from being out of town for a while.  When we had noticed a most beautiful upright dimond shape orange reddish light standing out from a black cloud background.   I had gotten out of the truck and stood there for a couple of minutes.  Then I had my buddy go and get my mother.   From the 2-3 mins it took him to go and get her, the most soothing light that I had ever seen gently faided upward, or backward, into the dark black clouds with ease, as it was in no hurry.;47.0879;-122.1879
