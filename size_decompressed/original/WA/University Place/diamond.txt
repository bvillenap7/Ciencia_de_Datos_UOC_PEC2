Diamond shaped object with lights flying end over end;2017-06-26 17:42:00;7 minutes;Diamond shaped Object with lights flying end over end Was in my backyard talking on my cell phone with a friend, when I noticed a diamond shaped object above my neighbor's house.  The object was silver, shiny reflecting light, had sparkling blinking white lights and was tumbling end over end as it flew over my backyard.  Although the object was silver when it flew, it also seemed to change to a darker silver.   There was no sound associated with this object.  Object was flying from the SW to the NE in a perfect straight line.  I watched it fly off into the distance.  I watched it for approximately 7 minutes from start to finish.   I live in one of the flight paths for SeaTac Airport and there were jets flying North to South while this object was flying by.   The sky was clear blue with a few clouds in the distance.   I did take pictures but the object showed as only a dot on my phone.   You can contact me if you wish.;47.2013;-122.5711
