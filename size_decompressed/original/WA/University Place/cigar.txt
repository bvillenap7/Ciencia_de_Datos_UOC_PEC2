Red pulsating lights east of University Place in the night sky.;2012-03-23 20:50:00;5 minutes;red pulsating lights east of University Place in the night sky. There were red pulsating lights in the middle and on each end of the ufo.  I also noticed tiny white lights flashing next to the red lights and they were very noticeable.   The object hovered for about five minutes, moving up and down slowly and then it slowly disappeared moving eastward I don't think we have the technology to do what this thing did.   My family and I were speechless could not believe what we saw.   Personally,it frighten me and I hope there is good explanation for what we saw.;47.2013;-122.5711
