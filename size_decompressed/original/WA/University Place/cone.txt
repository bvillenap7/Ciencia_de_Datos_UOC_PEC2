A silver cone/cylindrical shape appeared in the western sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));2007-06-18 20:40:00;20 minutes;My husand and I were sitting in our backyard looking at the Western horizon when a silver cone/cylindrical shape appeared in the sky.  It was about 1/3 the size of an airplane, made no sound, seemed to be rotating and definately traveling from North to South across the sky.   I have never seen anything like this in my life.  It was a bright silver but would change as it rotated...either the sun or moon seemed to illuminate it.   I am sixty years old, have been a public educator for 38 years and am interested if anyone else saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));47.2013;-122.5711
