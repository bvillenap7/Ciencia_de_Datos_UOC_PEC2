UFO over University Place/Tacoma area flying in a zig zag motion.;2003-09-02 22:20:00;20 seconds;UFO over University Place/Tacoma area flying in a zig zag motion. I noticed what I thought to be an airplane high in the distance, but I noticed that it did not have any lights flashing at all.  The object was a dull silver and kind of triangular, but it had very soft angles.  What made me realize it was not an airplane was it's movement.  It flew in a about a 60 degree angle to the right and smoothly changed directions, flying in a 180 degree angle to the left, then a 90 degree angle (vertically).  I hope someone else saw this tonight, because I ran down my stairs to try and get a better look and my view was blocked by a tall evergreen tree.

Slow moving, triangle shaped craft, with several redish lights and silent;2008-11-18 19:02:00;45 sec;Slow moving, triangle shaped craft, with several redish lights and silent We saw an object flying around 750-1000ft or so in the sky in a triangle shaped form.  It had a numerous number of lights along the shape of the craft (about 10 or so) in a light redish/orange color. The lights were dim but you could still make it out.  It lasted about 45 seconds and went by very slow and completely silent.;47.2013;-122.5711
Red lights on an equilateral object.;2013-07-02 04:21:00;10 minutes;Red lights on an equilateral object Went to let the dogs out this morning and there was a triangle shaped object with 3 red lights underneath it flying from South to North above the tree line.  You could see that it was an equilateral object.  It made a noise but not like a hum and not like a plane that would fly overhead on it's way to Sea-Tac Airport.  It was flying above the trees and my big dog and I watched it fly behind my neighbors trees going North.   Holding my thumb out at a 45 degree angle, the object was bigger than my thumb.  It is currently 59 degrees out, clear, warm and it was light out.  I did take pictures of the shy afterwards when I went back in to get my phone;47.2013;-122.5711
