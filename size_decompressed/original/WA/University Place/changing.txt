Blinking Silver ball changing to an oval shape;2016-10-11 10:10:00;16-17 minutes;Blinking Silver ball changing to an oval shape I was stopped Eastbound at the stop light at Cirques/56th St West.  I was the second car in the right hand lane coming from Cirque/56th St W.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a silver ball flying from the NE direction to my left across the street above the AM/PM and continuing SE on above the Nursing Home and the apartments on the opposite corner that I was stopped at.   At first, I thought it was a huge silver balloon but it flew in a straight path against a breeze we had blowing at the time.  The flags at the Texaco station were flying/blowing to the North and the object was moving at a steady pace in a South East direction.  It is also noted that this cool, crisp clear morning at approximately 10:10 am.  The object was silver in color and changed from a circle to an oval shape.  It was a solid object and you could see the outline of the object, but at the same time you could see the object change shape.  There were lights that were grayish/white that blinked around the center half of the craft.  When I held my finger up to the sky while sitting at the stop light my index finger did not cover the whole object.  While I was watched it flying the lights appeared to be blinking at random with no discerning pattern.  When my light changed I made a right from Cirque/56th St W. onto South Orchard St.  I followed the object for about 2 miles and I lost sight of it due to traffic.  I have included a picture from Google Earth showing the intersection I was at.;47.2013;-122.5711
