3 yellow gold objects in triangle formation.;2014-03-21 19:55:00;22 minutes;3 yellow gold objects in triangle formation At about 7:55 pm, I was traveling South on Orchard and had crested a hill near Praise Church, when I noticed 3 very bright yellow gold lights that were in a triangle formation.  The lights seemed to hover over what looked to be over the green belt area off of Emerson and Orchard.   As I got closer towards the intersection of Orchard and Emerson the objects appeared to hover and then the three objects changed direction, moving from right to left (eastward).   As they made this move, the triangle formation expanded and became bigger.  As I made a right turn from Orchard onto Emerson I pulled off to the road hand side of the road to watch them  (https://www.google.com/maps/@47.2209661,-122.5086383,360m/data=!3m1!1e3).  There was another car pulled off on the other side of the road we didn’t talk.  I stayed there about 10 mins watching the objects.  As I was watching them they flew in this bigger triangle towards the South, towards Lakewood.  I made a U turn back onto Emerson.  I made a right turn back onto Orchard and I was able to see the objects flying towards Lakewood…  When I was on Lakewood Drive (Orchard turns into Lakewood Dr) and 80th St SW one of the objects started to fly off and the other two lights dimmed to a faint gold color and then the objects just went dark.  At this time I was near Stoney Creek Apts and across the street is the Fleet Creek open area (https://www.google.com/maps/@47.1807927,-122.5065424,352m/data=!3m), where I saw the objects black out in the sky and disappear.  Of note the skies were clear and there were many vehicles on Orchard and Emerson.;47.2013;-122.5711
