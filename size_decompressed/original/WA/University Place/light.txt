Three bright lights in triangle formation travel night sky,  horizon to horizon in 3 seconds.;2011-03-22 22:02:00;3 seconds;Three bright lights in triangle formation travel night sky,  horizon to horizon in 3 seconds. Last night March 21, 2011 in University Place Washington USA, at > approximately 10:00PM I was outside looking up at the sky. Seeing very > few clouds and lots of stars. From the southern horizon I noticed > three lights that were the size and brightness of Venus traveling > north in a triangle formation. They started joining to form one light > then back to triangle (this happened several times), then just one of > three made several in/out/up/back movements. It disappeared over the > north horizon. I put my hand up and moved it across the sky in the > same line the lights had traveled, counting up to 3 seconds. There were no engine noises, no sonic boom, and they traveled the > south to north horizon in just 3 seconds. This morning I looked on www.historychannel.com for the UFO Show. Under sightings I found another sighting similar to mine in the USA. This was an amazing thing to see, even at only 3 seconds.;47.2013;-122.5711
Massive bright white light traveling S to N....the light was huge...not traveling at a terribly fast rate of speed ((anonymous report));2017-10-27 06:10:00;1 minute;Massive bright white light traveling south to north....the light was huge...not traveling at a terribly fast rate of speed initially but then took off at such a fast rate of speed that I would even be able to begin to estimate in MPH.  What stood out was the size of the light and the brightness of it...  The light did not just simply turn off but rather quickly disapated as it appeared to be traveling upward.  Never seen anything like it… additionally I have a light that was somehow not lit in my back yard however when this bright light in the sky finally disappeared the light in my back yard all of sudden turned back on.

Bright light erratic movements in the sky.;2018-03-13 22:00:00;Ongoing;Bright light erratic movements in the sky. Looked up in the sky and saw a bright light through the clouds.  It moved fairly quickly across about 1/6th of the sky.  I had assumed it was only a satellite until it stopped.   After about 15 seconds it changed directions at a sharp 90° angle went on for about 30 seconds to a minute and changed directions again, this time back towards the way it came for about another minute or 2.  It stopped there and didn't move for awhile.   I went inside for about 20 minutes and just went back out.  It's gone now.  Current time 22:30.  Maybe somebody else saw this.;47.2013;-122.5711
