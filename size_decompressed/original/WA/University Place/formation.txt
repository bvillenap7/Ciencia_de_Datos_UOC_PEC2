Three starlike objects moving SLOWLY across the sky in unison either at high altitude or in orbit.;2015-12-25 16:30:00;20 seconds;Three starlike objects moving SLOWLY across the sky in unison either at high altitude or in orbit. I was sitting on my south facing rear patio just after sunset, when I noticed what appeared to be a satellite moving SLOWLY across the sky in a southeasterly direction.  I initially observed it through the bare branches of my neighbor's large oak tree which was followed by the observation of two more similar objects travelling on parallel courses in a narrow angle of view.   After several seconds, I excitedly summoned my wife to come outside to witness what I was experiencing but the objects had already disappeared. The objects looked like stars but moved like satellites.  The fact that there were three of them and they all slowly moved in unison was very unnerving.   I had never seen anything like it in my lifetime.;47.2013;-122.5711
