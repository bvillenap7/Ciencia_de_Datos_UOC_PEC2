I was traveling south on I-5 between SeaTac airport and the city of SeaTac (can't remember exact location) en route to Olympia.  I saw a large white ball of light slowly descending southeast of my position. My first thought was that it was some sort of a meteorite, because it seemed to be streaking slowly down toward the horizon.  Then it seemed to travel in a southeast direction and the tail got smaller and smaller.   Some trees momentarily blocked my view, and when I could again see the patch of sky where it had been, it was gone. It wasn't a vapor trail from an airplane, and it was moving so slowly that I assumed it was something in the upper atmosphere.   My second thought was space junk burning up in the atmosphere, but I did see the space junk that burned up in the atmosphere a year or two ago, and it looked very different (space junk looked sparkly, versus just a solid patch of light like my sighting).   My next thought was that it was a meteorite, and I really expected to see it continue falling to the ground followed by a big explosion (actually picked up my cell phone to let my husband know my location should it touchdown). Two nights later there was a segment on Q13 news about some UFO sightings in China.  They showed some of the Chinese newscast images of their UFOs, which looked very much like what I saw, only their were moving horizontally, while mine appeared to be moving vertically.  Sent an email to the news to ask them if anyone else had reported a sighting after seeing their report, but got no response.;47.4485;-122.2922
