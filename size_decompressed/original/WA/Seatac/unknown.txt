It had a small ring of circle shaped lights on the top, a large ring of lights in the middle and the same smaller ring on the bottom.   Stayed in sight for about 15-20 seconds until we exited the freeway ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.4485;-122.2922

It was fast and zigged, looking asterisk-like. It may have searched for signal source. I saw a UFO over Angle Lake.  Naturally, being close to Seattle-Tacoma airport, many planes flew overhead.  But, the UFO was up way, way, way higher. It was so high that it was almost imperceptible.  From the lake, it looked asterisk-shaped.  It covered distance a lot faster than the others, crossing almost all visible sky in just a couple minutes.  It came mostly from the East.  It did not fly exactly straight, but kind of zigged and zagged.  It looked white.  It flew over the lake and suddenly stopped to change directions. From where I stood, it didn't look like it turned around, but that it just started flying pretty much backwards where it came from.  The reversal was not a complete 180 degrees, but pretty close.  Zigging and zagging a little.  I believe someone with an involuntary, lifelong Air Force radio implant was at the lake.  I believe when the craft located the source of the radio, it left the area.;47.4485;-122.2922
