Lights over Seatc.;2004-02-04 18:05:00;10sec;Lights over Seatc. This evening while driving from so 188th onto 509 north I saw three bright white lights shining from east of SeaTac airport near the south end of the runway near so 188th street (near the Red Lion). Each light was equally sized and equally spaced from each other forming what appeared to be a perfect triangle. The lights were not moving and remained fixed in the one spot. The lights were too large and in a area which would normally not be traveled by aircraft. I watched as long as possible before losing sight. The lights elevation was above anything fixed on the ground.;47.4485;-122.2922
