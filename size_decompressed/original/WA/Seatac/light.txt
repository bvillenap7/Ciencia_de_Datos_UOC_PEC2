On July 15, 2011, at about 11:15 p.m., I saw a strange light above the SeaTac Airport below the cloud cover in SeaTac, WA. I was driving East on S 170th Street (just passing 31st Avenue S, by the Master Park Lot B), when I first saw the light South-South-East of me directly over the airport.  As I came to the stoplight at the intersection of S 170th and Pacific Highway South I could see that the whitish/yellowish light was moving North.  It seemed like it was travelling right through the middle of the airport.   The light was not flashing or blinking, it appeared to be a single light.  It moved at about the speed you might see a helicopter moving at, like the ones I see leaving the Renton Airfield all the time.  But this was definitely not a helicopter and I’m not an expert or anything, but I know helicopters don’t fly directly over the airport like that. I turned right (North) on Pacific Hwy after sitting at the stop light and watching this strange light.  It was out of my view at this point.  When I reached the next stop light at the cemetery, I turned around to see where and what the light was.  I could see it through the trees in the cemetery now, and it was beginning to turn to the East, toward Burien.  I returned to the intersection of Pacific Hwy S and S 170th St. again, this time turning right (East) back onto S 170th and continuing on Eastbound. The light was in full view, directly out in front of me in the distance, as I passed under the overpass on S 170th.  I watched it from the stop sign.  The light seemed to fade in and out once not blink or flash, but gradually disappear and then come back.  I could see that it was moving away from me to the East and slightly North and then it seemed to just disappear into the clouds over Burien area. This all took place over a course of about 10-12 minutes.  The light was small it looked like about the size of a large start might look, except this was obviously in our atmosphere and below the cloud cover.  The height in the sky was maybe 30-50 deg. off my horizon.  I’m not real good at estimating the height, but I can say it was definitely not more than 50 deg., as I was able to see it in my peripheral without having to look up much to see it.  That’s how it caught my eye, I noticed it moving out of the corner of my eye. This statement is true and without falsehood and to the best of my recollection.  I am journalist for a local newspaper and understand and acknowledge the importance of accuracy of any account to be reported.  I am also a single mother and active member of the community in regard to local politics and the public schools my children attend.  I have been living in the SeaTac area for a little over two years now and have lived in Western Washington for close to 10 years.

Bright lights moving in a clockwise manner were observed at 3:30am;2020-04-13 03:31:00;10 minutes;Bright lights moving in a clockwise manner were observed at 3:30am I want to report that at 3:31am, the morning of April 13th, 2020 I observed through my bedroom window some strange lights. There about 5 or more bright lights which seemed to be milling around in a clockwise manner. They were so bright it reminded me of a beacon type light.  But they may have been at a distance of 10 miles away.  Although this seemed strange I did not go outside to investigate further as I don’t feel safe outside at night. About 4am I looked again and saw the moon but not any more of the lights. I live about 3 miles east of SeaTac airport and wonder if anyone that works in their control tower might have seen something. I live alone, am 87 years old and spent my working life working with mechanical things such as bus engines for Metro and ship engines in the Navy.;47.4485;-122.2922
