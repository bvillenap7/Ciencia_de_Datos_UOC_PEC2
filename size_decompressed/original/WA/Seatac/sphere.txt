I am a 34 YO apartment manager and small business owner living in Seattle. My father is a retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. fighter pilot, so I have quite a bit of knowledge when it comes to things flying in the skies due to his shared experiences and the many hours of spending time at USAF bases and air shows with him. On Tuesday, December 21st at approximately 3:30 in the afternoon, I was driving alone southbound on Interstate 5 just past downtown Seattle and noticed a silverish-grey, spherical metallic object hovering in the sky at what I would guess to be at a height of about 500-700 ft. up and at a distance from me at around 6-8 miles in the southern sky (over the Southcenter Mall area). If I were to put my hand at arms length, it would have been just slightly smaller than my thumbnail. It moved up and down several times...not like a balloon does in a floating manner with a wind, but moving up, stopping for a second, then moving down then stopping. It did this several times then went from left to right a few times in the same manner. The area it covered in these maneuvers would be maybe 30-40 ft? (probably about an area the size of my fist at arms length) Then it seemed to shrink in on itself and just vanished completely. There were a few passenger aircraft in the sky due to it's close proximity to SeaTac International Airport, but nothing close enough that it would have been a danger...at least not during the time I witnessed it. Total time from the moment I saw it until it vanished was about 30 seconds.;47.4485;-122.2922
Bright orange orb flown over by landing aircraft at Seatac.;2012-09-14 19:00:00;3 seconds;Bright orange orb flown over by landing aircraft at Seatac. I was a passenger on an Alaska Airlines flight, landing at Seatac.  We were on final approach, gear and flaps down, lined up with the runway, landing from the south. I had a window seat, 8F, in a 737-400. A bright orange orb came into view, as if it was hovering or floating, not more than a couple of hundred feet below our aircraft, possibly less than that.  We quickly passed overhead, and I lost sight of it as it went out of sight behind our plane.  It was orange, as bright as a crab pot buoy, a very vivid, intense orange. It appeared to be about 3-4 feet in diameter, but that was difficult to judge due to our relative speed in flying by. It's possible it was a balloon, but it would have been at about 1,500' altitude, and directly in the path of landing aircraft.  I was surprised to see more aircraft landing behind our plane, as the orb was so visible, and very close to the approach flightpath. I would have thought our pilots would have seen and reported it as a hazard to navigation, even if it was a balloon. The sun was just setting behind the mountains on the Olympic Peninsula at the time of the sighting, and I was looking out to the east.;47.4485;-122.2922
