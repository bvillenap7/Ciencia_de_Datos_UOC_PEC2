Flying wing spotted over SeaTac Airport at night.;2016-08-11 22:00:00;20 seconds;Flying wing spotted over SeaTac Airport at night. I work at SeaTac Airport and was working on a jetbridge around 10 pm.  While I was looking skyward to see some equipment, a moving object caught my eye.  It appeared to be a flying wing marked on the underside with 4 sharp-angled chevrons with contrasting shading.  It was a VERY dark object, with no illumination at all.  It was travelling due south at a consistent speed.  There appeared to be no organic ancillary movement like a bird would demonstrate it definitely moved with mechanical fluidity. I could not determine with any certainty the size, elevation, or speed of the object due to the lack of visual scale cues.  It was in my field of vision for only about 10 or 15 seconds after which I could no longer detect it in the dark sky.  Most strange was the fact that it was directly above SeaTac International Airport. Observer is a 40 year old male in good health.;47.4485;-122.2922
