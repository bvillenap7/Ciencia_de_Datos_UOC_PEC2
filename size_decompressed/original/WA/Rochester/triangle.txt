triangular shape with lights, several other much smaller craft darting erratically in area;2010-03-06 20:00:00;6 minutes;triangular shape with lights, several other much smaller craft darting erratically in area There was 1 large triangular ship with 2 rectangular amber lights on the flat end and 1 light on the point.  It appeared to hoover while a group of 5 small craft darted back and forth moving erratically in a small area.   At the same time in another part of the sky we observed 2 more small craft moving erratically away from the area.  The large ship disappeared within 4-5 minutes, with the smaller crafts remaining for approximately 5 more minutes.  My husband and I both observed these, and when we went to work that night, we started to tell a co worker, and he stopped us, and described the same observance and time frame as we did.  He lives about 30 miles from us.;46.8213;-123.0356
