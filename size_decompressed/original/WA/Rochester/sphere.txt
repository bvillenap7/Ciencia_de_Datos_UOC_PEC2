Silent craft moving across the sky;2012-04-24 02:45:00;20 seconds;Silent craft moving across the sky I was walking outside at night when I looked up in the sky and saw 2 object, one directly in front of the other, going across the sky. I could not tell the shape of the object, it looked like a star. I know it wasn't a star because you could tell that it was lower than the stars. At first I thought it could be 2 satellites, one in front of the other. Except I have seen satellites and that isn't what this was. It actually could have been one craft with one light in the front and one in the rear. I saw it move across the sky, away from me, for about 20 seconds before it just disappeared.  It didn't appear to just shoot off into space. I just moved across the sky and disappeared.  If this was 2 objects, they were moving in formation at the same speed.  This wasn't a know aircraft, it was completely silent. From my point of view the object looked like this: .    .   Could this have been 2 satellites moving across the sky in formation? Sure. Only I've seen satellites before and satellites always appear smaller, and stay in the sky a lot longer.  Plus I've never seen 2 move across the sky in a formation like this. Let alone seem to appear and disappear so quickly ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));46.8213;-123.0356
