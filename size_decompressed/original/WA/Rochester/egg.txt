If I extended my arm it would have been the size of my little fingernail.  It was light gray in color and the weird thing is it disappeared.  First half of it winked out and then I observed the other half fade to nothingness! Ovoid shaped craft..not flying too fast...disappeared 1/2 at a time. How weird..thought at first it had flown into a cloud, but the eastern sky was virtually clear.  The aft part of it went first, just quickly diapperaing.  The front of it slowly faded until nothing was there.;46.8213;-123.0356
