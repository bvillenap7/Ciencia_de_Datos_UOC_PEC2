Flashes of light during meteor shower;2013-08-14 00:30:00;2 minutes;Flashes of light during meteor shower While hoping to catch the last night of the meteor shower, I began to see strange flashes in the sky. I have seem something similar to this a few years ago.  This time I only saw 3 flashes,  though the last time I saw something like this the flashes continued for iver 30 min.  The first 2 flashes appeard to be stationary, the 3rd flash came from just to the right if the previous 2.  I am willing to consider that these flashes were an optical illusion, and that I was just witnessing meteors coming directly at me, which is why I was unable to see a tail.  However, these flashes were very similar to the event I had witnessed in the past.  I also want to add that I didnt see these flashes out if the corner of my eye, I was looking directly at them.;46.8213;-123.0356
