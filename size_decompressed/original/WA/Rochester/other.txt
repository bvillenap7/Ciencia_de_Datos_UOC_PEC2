Its been a long time ago. I have just recently been able to talk about it. It was a huge Boomerang craft. Totally silent. It was going so slow I thought it would fall out of the sky. I have time loss and had an implant so I assume I was abducted but have no memory of this. I have proof of the implant. But something made me throw it away. My dentist has Xrays of it. It came out when I had teeth next to the sinus. I do not remember the craft going away. I have since lost contact with the 2 others. But last I knew one remembered it the other did not. This is very odd since she was the one to tell me to run outside to look at it. Maybe she just didnt want to remember I dont know. This craft was moving from the south going north. What Id like to know is....Was there ever anyother reports of seeing this humungous craft besides me? Thank youâ€¦((name deleted));46.8213;-123.0356
Slow moving light in triangular formation, traveling east to northeasterly direction, holding same pattern .2 lights fore/1 aft;2002-08-12 02:29:00;2 minutes;Slow moving light in triangular formation, traveling east to northeasterly direction, holding same pattern .2 lights fore/1 aft We were watching the meteor shower from our backyard. We went outside approximately 2 a.m. and at about 2:15 a.m. saw a single light traveling east/southeast. It did not have a tail althought we thought it might be a part of the meteor shower. It faded from sight after about 45 seconds. It travelled at the rate of a small plane, but was far too high in the sky to be a small airplane. As we continued to watch the shower, we saw three lights in a triangular formation traveling from northeast/to a northerly direction. They kept an equal distance from each other with two lights in the forward position and one light trailing. It was like an elongated triangular shape. They traveled across the sky (again at about the same rate as a small airplane .. but very high in the sky) keeping pace until they disappeared from sight. No tail. No other motion ... just even, slow rate of speed.;46.8213;-123.0356
