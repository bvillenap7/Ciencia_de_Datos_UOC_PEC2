No wind that day,  Object was teardrop shaped but was angular like the windshield canopy of a stealth fighter.  Got a very good look at it as it was very clear that day.  My daughter was driving and saw it also.  Was expecting to see other post on this site about it as it flew over a populated area.;47.3168;-121.9958
