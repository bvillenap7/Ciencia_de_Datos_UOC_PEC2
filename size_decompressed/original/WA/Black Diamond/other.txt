Object landed in our field,some type of persons on board looking cloned or identical with unpigmented white skin.;1985-08-01 20:00:00;15min;Object landed in our field,some type of persons on board looking cloned or identical with unpigmented white skin. a semi square object about the size of two side by side hummers,dark bodied with recessed lights in the high,mid and lower sections spaced apart equally, landed in our field.Its presence was felt pre landing by a repition of rapid vibrating of our mobile home.There was the sound of rushing air during the landing and no wind but a very loud rush of the air sound.We knew it landed because of the intense bright white that flooded through are home,even through our walls in small specs.Our outside walls are metal/aluminum but the light came through.We ran outside and looked at the semi square craft.It had lights on it.That was the source of the light.It was the brightest light I have ever seen yet it did not cause you to squint.It had windows in the upper potion through wich I could see an area. There were Human looking,dark clothed extremely pale white skin persons inside.They did not seem to have a skin pigment.They had very black hair. They all looked identical. The 4 of us ran back inside.In a moment of fear we all looked at each other and screamed and cried frantically.My first thought of panic was,we need to breath-I hope they know we need air.Then we ran back out side to look agin,confirm to ourselves something had really landed.The craft lifted to about as high as the telephone pole and sat completely still in the air,its lights changed direction like it was looking at the previous landing area.Then a shrill sound began.it increased in repition to a hum.It left straight up,high speed.At a point in the sky we could no longer tell if it was there,it blended in with the twinkeling stars.In the sky above us was a neon blue streak where its path had been.We called local police who said they had calls of lights of a downed airplane or helicopter from other locals.They were looking into it.An airplane with a satelite dish on it flew by after.It looked like one of our comercial airplanes except for the big dish.The next day we looked at the ground.Our field grass was laid down in a cicle appr! ox 12-15ft round.The craft its self was not round but its landing area was.There were no burns or damage to the grass wich was long and laid in a cicle pattern all in one direction.We later compared the sound to airwolf,the only show we could relate a description of the sound to only faster.The phone lines and electrical lines to our home were not damaged,although they would have been severed if the craft had a propeller of any kind.It landed extremely close to our pole,lines and fence not damaging anything.After,on some days I would see a white Dodge Airies type vehicle pulled over at the roadside there.An elderly gentleman would be taking pictures.Nobody ever questioned us or gave an explanation.Towns people talked of something crashing but there was no crash.My childrens father who would not come outside with us to look because of fear says it had to be a jet helicopter landing because of the sound.We know it was not.
