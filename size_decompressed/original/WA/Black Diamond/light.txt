Rainier?), multiple colors illuminated like fire flames all around the edges of a bright white dome.  The multi-colors popped out like they were piercing through a door crack at night, as though one edge was the object and one edge was space.  Sometimes slow and then piercingly fast multi-colored lights. Electric bright: lite and dark pink, lite and dark blue, lime green, dark red.  Two times an exact white beam of light would appear straight down into the clouds, and around that beam was a weird whitish-blue glow like a flash light into the clouds. The light would slowly move from left to right, as though observing an area in the clouds and then the flash-light slowly faded off, but the bright white star and multi-colors remained constant. The clouds moved in after 30 minutes and blocked any further sight of the object.;47.3168;-121.9958
