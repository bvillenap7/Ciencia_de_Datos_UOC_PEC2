Solid red light with blue-white strobe zig zags acorss the sky.;2015-03-05 19:45:00;5 minutes;Solid red light with blue-white strobe zig zags acorss the sky I was walking my dog this evening when I noticed a red light in the sky overhead.  It didn’t appear to be moving.  I found that odd, so we stopped to observe.   After a few seconds it moved to the east.  Ok, I thought, probably a helicopter.  I continued to watch because I don’t remember seeing a static red light in the sky before.   The craft then made a 90 degree maneuver very quickly and then continued to move east.   At this point I noticed a blue white strobe at the front of the craft.   As I watched this craft move east it would stop entirely, change directions, and then continue to head east toward Lake Washington.  It appeared to be zig-zagging, doing course corrections with very fast and tight moves.   I thought perhaps it was a drone, or maybe still a helicopter, but I have never seen anything maneuver like that, stop cold and then continue to move again.   I think the craft was about 1500 feet in the air, and it was moving about the speed of a helicopter, though it would accelerate and then slow down again.  All I saw were the lights, no fuselage.   The moon was full and very bright, but this was very easy to see.;47.75038;-122.32976
I noticed a light way up in the sky, and quickly realized a second light following.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-01 21:45:00;1 minute;At 9:45pm, I was sitting outside looking at the sky and noticed a light way up in the sky, and quickly realized a second light following it, so I knew it could not have been a satellite.   The craft was heading south and slowly disappeared out of our skies (my sight) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.75038;-122.32976
