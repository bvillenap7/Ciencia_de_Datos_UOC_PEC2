Stationary cross-shaped object flashing lights;2014-12-15 02:30:00;35 minutes;Stationary cross-shaped object flashing lights Just stepped out for a smoke and saw what looks like cross shaped object with red, white, blue, green lights.  The lights are flashing and there doesn't appear to be any pattern to the flashing, if that makes sense.  The object appears to be a couple miles high above lake Washington.  It's not making any sound and it's not moving at all.  I tried to get a picture of it but the camera on my phone sucks.  Really weird that it's not moving.  Not making a sound.;47.75038;-122.32976
