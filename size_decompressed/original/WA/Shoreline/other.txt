Viewed bright elliptical object descending in the north sky.;2002-03-17 18:30:00;5 seconds;Viewed bright elliptical object descending in the north sky. I am a 41 y.o. female.  This is my 2nd sighting.  I was driving north on 15th N.E. and 175th St.  I was stopped at the light on 175th St.  I very quickly observed in the sky directly in front of me an elliptical shaped, very bright object that went from one point downward at about a 40 degree angle and then out of sight.  I first thought it was a meteor but it seemed to be very bright and it wasn't very dark out yet. It went down from the right to the left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is correct in her description of events.  Many other reports for the fireball seen on this St. Patrick's Day.  It appears to have been quite high in the atmosphere, and it may have been a meteor.  However, that is only a guess.  PD));47.75038;-122.32976
To small to be a jet, not right for a private prop.;2006-09-28 01:40:00;20 minutes;To small to be a jet, not right for a private prop. Saw something that looked like a jet flying above richmond beach. However it was way to small to be a jet, finally the sound of the engine came, sounded like a regular private prop plane, no, after it passed it was more of a jet engine sound. It was to small to be a passenger jet, yet not making the right sound for a single prop, It didn't even look like a private prop, I didn't really get a good look at it due to the time of day, or shall I say morning. My friend and I were just there kickin it walking around the beach. For lack of nothing better to do. But this one ufo kept circling above us, also it was even weirder that it was circling around O'ryans belt and all the shooting stars seemed to be brightest while traveling through this area in the sky. My friend is in denial, he believes it was just an actual private jet, but I say it was WAY to small it couldn't be. He was convinced by the lighting screme on it that it had to be a plane. But I still think it wasn't. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));47.75038;-122.32976
UFO Photographed Over Puget Sound June 20 2008 753PM;2008-06-20 19:53:00;5 minutes;UFO Photographed Over Puget Sound June 20 2008 753PM From Richmond Beach Washington looking west across Puget Sound I saw something glinting in the sun.  I took four photographs of the object with a 432mm zoom lens.  It was about half the size of a medium sized sailboat.  It moved very slowly from south to north before it disappeared.  The object was irregularly shaped, you really need to look at the photos.  It was gold colored and highly reflective.

Their was no visual site due to very heavy fog.  I believe this fog is on purpose to hide how huge these crafts are.;2014-01-16 01:00:00;4:00;Their was no visual site due to very heavy fog.  I believe this fog is on purpose to hide how huge these crafts are.  The sounds I have been hearing are a deep low surging hum.  I also hear trumpet sounds very loud last Saturday night.  I have been dealing with out of body experiences and feel a wierd connection to what has been happening.  I have never shared before but feel a profound need to state what I have heard and experienced.  Also, and very important my dog was extremely nerves and kept near me and kept looking around my room.  Really strange but I feel animals can detect even more.  Thank you;47.75038;-122.32976
