Very close to ;1999-10-20 22:25:00;2.5 seconds;A bright, orange and yellowish light that shot from East to West across the sky keeping the same heighth and precision.  Very close to me... I was jogging North on 5th Avenue and saw a light orange and goldish object/light shoot from East to West in a precision line lasting about 2.5 seconds.  It was very, very bright and had a long tail of light behind it almost like a shooting star but it was so close.  It seemed maybe a half mile ahead and a quarter mile high and was very precise.  Although it is possible that it could have been a meteorite, I have seen many and this did not appear to be one based on the size, precision, speed, and the fact that it kept its exact heigth horizontally.  Thank you for recording this. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports.  Seen as far south as Amity, OR.  Level  flight seems peculiar to us.  Also reported to the north from points in British Columbia.));47.75038;-122.32976
Very large bright green fireball;2007-11-13 20:00:00;couple seconds;Very large bright green fireball I saw a very large, bright green object (a meteor?), appearing to travel west-to-east (I was traveling south in Shoreline).  It only lasted a couple seconds but was very very large and very bright (and green).  I know the Leonid showers are supposed to start this weekend, but if this was from that or not I don't know.  It seems like it'd be early. ((name deleted))  P.S. ((female name deleted))  (from the Last Exit) says hi.;47.75038;-122.32976
Greenish fireball streaking through sky at high velocity;2021-04-02 20:38:00;< 2 seconds;Greenish fireball streaking through sky at high velocity My wife and I were heading northbound on Interstate 5 at approximately 20:38 on 02 April 2021.  Having just traveled past the north Seattle City limits and entering Shoreline, WA, we both saw, to our surprise, a large glowing green round object streak through the sky  in the northbound direction.  Although it appeared as a ball of light, the edges of the object were less defined as if the object had a glow to it.  Our visibility through the windshield was at best 35-40 degrees of the sky, through which the object appeared for less than two seconds, indicating it is estimated to  have been traveling at a speed several times faster than the speed of sound.;47.75038;-122.32976
