On 11/16/2014 @ 5:45pm in Shoreline,WA, I was in my backyard with my binoculars looking up at the east sky.  I saw a V shaped object.  It was traveling north to south towards SeaTac Airport.   The object appeared to be several round balls together to make a V shape.  It was bigger than a star and smaller than the moon.  The object made no sound and had no lights. It was grayish in color.  The object just seemed to glide silently across the sky.   I watched for a couple of minutes till it seemed to be close to the Airport, then it turned into a mist and just disappeared.   I'm a 50 years old, a stay at home caregiver who never would have thought to be writing a UFO report, but I can't deny what I saw.   Even if I don't know exactly what it was.  But I needed to share my experience.;47.75038;-122.32976
