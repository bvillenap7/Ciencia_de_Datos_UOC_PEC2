We pulled over and joined the group to stare amazingly at the aircraft.  It was about 3-400' feet long, shaped like the Goodyear Blimp, was hovering motionless with no sound (no engines could be seen anywhere on the craft), and it had brilliant multicolored lights from top to bottom.  The lights were going on and off, moving in a clock-wise pulsating fashion from end to end.  Truly an amazing sight.  After staring for about 5 minutes the craft, without a whisper of any sound, shot straight East at a low altitude and disappeared in less than 3 seconds.  We all looked at each other in disbelief, got in our cars and headed North on 1-5. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.75038;-122.32976

I saw in a sw sky a large orange egg shaped object that appeared to steak thru the sky on the level. I could not tell you how far out into the Pacific it went, but this thing was enormoius, about half the size of a full moon, three other smaller objects appeared to be drawn to it, and then it disappeared, this was no plane approaching Boeing Field for landing, it was traveling in the opposite direction, it had no lights, and the speed was nothing that I have ever witnessed before in my life. I called a few local t.v stations to inquire if anyone else reported this.  I would love to hear back from anyone witnessing these objects in the April sky.;47.75038;-122.32976
