Pulsing light flashes in front of the ISS, caught on a high-resolution photo.;2015-06-13 22:00:00;2 minutes;Pulsing light flashes in front of the ISS, caught on a high-res photo. Saturday, June 13th around 10 pm I was outside on my property with my son teaching him long exposure night photography.  We noticed the ISS coming from the southwest.   We swung the camera around to its direction.  I was shooting with a canon 5D Mark III with a 18-35 L glass lens on a Manfrotto tripod.  I shoot in Raw format as well. When the ISS was in the lenses field of view, I pressed the shutter, then went back to looking at the sky.  We watched the ISS moving fast and very bright.   In the path of ISS we saw a flash of light.  I asked my son if he saw that, he said yes.  As the ISS continued towards the flash, we saw it again in the same position only a bit higher.   We could faintly see it moving higher as the station was approaching its position.  It seemed to pulse as it was rising.  It was dimmer in luminance then a satellite would be, and then was not visible, then flashed and continued rising. Once the ISS passed the position of the flashes, we stared at the sky, but could no longer see the light.  I scrambled it hit the shutter button again to take another photo.   It was about 20 seconds later that I took another 30 second image.  On the first 30 second image that I took you can see the streak of light from the ISS and the movement of the stars.  You can also see a pulsing dim light and we caught one of the flashes.  There is no streak or, star like blur as the subject seems to be stationary but rising between pulses.  There is also no movement/blur in the flash and you can see a dark circle in the middle of the flash .... I have the original untouched raw photos and still have the original images on the SD card... Thank you for your interestâ€¦ ((first name deleted));47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439
Late afternoon sighting of four objects over Seattle seen from Bainbridge.;2016-09-03 18:00:00;10 minutes;Late afternoon sighting of four objects over Seattle seen from Bainbridge. Pulled into my driveway and last of afternoon sun hit a plane flying up in sky - caught my eye.  As I looked at plane I notice four round white objects way up in sky and wondered what they were. They seemed to move into a formation of a Z and held their position.  Then one white orb starts moving up and looks like it's going to hit one of the orbs and then moves and hovers over the top. Either a cloud passed by or they recessed into clouds then next thing there are three in a vertical row with one off to the left.  Shortly thereafter,again, a cloud either passes or they somehow recess and next there's only three and they haveformed an upside down V. I watched until they disapeared and did not come back. I was freaking out.;47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439
