Boxy cylinder/barrel shaped with flickering orange glow on one side moving slowly.;2016-06-29 21:43:00;2 minutes;Boxy cylinder/barrel shaped with flickering orange glow on one side moving slowly. Craft was moving slowing south to north directly overhead and either was lit by the setting sun or had fire onboard.  The orange glow was all I saw at first (I thought it was Mars) and then seemed to pulse and flicker only illuminating one side and eventually went out completely leaving a barrel or boxy cylinder shape moving slowly away.  I was able to view the craft for approx. 1.5 minutes through binoculars until I lost it behind trees.  Perhaps a Chinese lantern?;47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439
