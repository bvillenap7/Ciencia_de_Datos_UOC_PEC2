tiny white blob moving irregularly in southern sky;2005-03-10 17:35:00;2 minutes;tiny white blob moving irregularly in southern sky looking south from bainbridge/seattle ferry dock on bainbridge, saw tiny white blob with suggestions of blue edges moving very slowly and erraticly through light chemtrail clouds, on about a south/southwest bearing. object first observed approx. 28 degrees above horizon, during viewing moved approx. 5 degrees toward southern horizon. sun was low but still quite bright so lots of contrast.  several planes were visible around the same area, so it was easy to judge by comparison that this was not a winged aircraft. object vanished from sight quite suddenly, there one second, gone the next.;47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439
