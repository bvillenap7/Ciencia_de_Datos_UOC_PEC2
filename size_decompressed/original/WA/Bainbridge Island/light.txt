Entity was a single bright light, resembling venus insofar as the light had constant intensity and no flashing. Entity moved from NW to SE for about a minute, then made a right-angle turn to the south. Travel path was 'jagged' rather than straight. Because our spot was surrounded by tall trees, viewing time was limited.;47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439

First we thought it was a satellite, but then it started to curve down fast and behind the trees.   We ran over to were we could see it and when we saw it it wasn't moving.  After about 30 seconds it slowly started to move out of view so we ran back to were we we were at the start.   It then reappeared on the left side of the trees and became at least 3 times the brightness and size of Jupiter on a really clear night then became the brightness of a satellite again.   Then it continued behind us and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439
