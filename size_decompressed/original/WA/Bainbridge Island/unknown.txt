I saw at first what appeared to be 3 planes over the horizon East of me, this being very strange to me because of the larger number than normal planes in that area. A minute later I glaned up again and noted that the 3 objects were not moving nor did they have flashing lights that all planes do. I watched in curiosity for at least a minute at the 3 unmoving objects when I called out to my dad to come look. Just Then the dimmer objects shot south at incredible speed sinking behind the trees in time for my father to see them for only a second. The remaining brighter one appered to flicker like candle but stll remain sationery for another minute before it also falowed the other two in a sloping soutward direction bu much slower. They were all orange in color and stood out from ordinary aircraft because of reconizable planes flying behind them and their movment.;47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439
Someone in my bedroom, at least 3, and one touching me on the front where the crease of my neck is, my body tingling;1999-04-04 21:30:00;2 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We talked with this person.  This report appears to be submitted by a very reliable source.)) Someone in my bedroom, at least 3, and one touching me on the front where the crease of my neck is, my body tingling I went to bed early, 9:00 p.m., I thought I woke up but could have been asleep.  I felt that there was a person in my room.  I heard faint talking and then I realized that there were about 3 people, I thought men, in my room.  I was scared and my heart was beating fast.  I felt paralyzed and couldn't turn to look.  I was so scared I was afraid of looking.  I was sleeping on my right side with back towards the windows and they were standing behind me.  I felt hands come to the front of my neck, right where the crease is.  The hands or tips of the fingers touched there, resting on the crease.  I felt my torso tingling.  The phone rang and I completely woke up and was thankful.  I told the person on the phone what had happened.  I also told other people because it was so real to me.  One person mentioned that it sounded like an alien encounter.  Two weeks past the incident I went in for my annual check-up and the nurse left a message on my phone to contact them about my lab results.  I have always been in perfect health except for skin cancer and tooth problems.  I called and she said that my blood showed that I had a hyperthyroid and that I needed to come in for tests.  I was totally shocked.  However, the next day the occurrence of what happened two weeks prior came to my mind and the placement of the hands.  They were placed on my thyroid.  I go in for tests on May 11.  I still don't know for sure if it was a dream or reality but to me it seemed very real.  Not too many things frighten me but I was very scared and felt there was something going on behind my back (no puns intended).  I witnessed a UFO sighting in 1966 - saw the craft up close and thought that maybe they are tracking me.  I have never reported my sighting until now.  The person that saw the UFO with me is now dead but the last time I was with him we talked about it.  The craft we saw was huge with no sound and hovered above us and above the trees.;47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439
This is a report of an unusual sound.  I am submitting this because I heard that lights in the sky had been seen at this time by others;2004-06-03 02:44:00;15 sec;This is a report of an unusual sound.  I am submitting this because I heard that lights in the sky had been seen at this time by others.  The sound began with a series of soft booms like distant fireworks in rapid succession, lasting about 5 seconds.  It then gradually smoothed to a low rumble, and maintained the same volume for perhaps another 5 seconds.  During the next and final 5 seconds it very gradually faded away, so gradually that I was not sure when it was completely gone.  I am familiar with the tendency for people to overestimate the duration of events, so this morning I ran several timed tests with a stopwatch, reciting to myself the changing nature of the sound, and only looking at the watch after.  I consistently measured within 2 seconds +- of 15 seconds, trying 4 times.  The sound occurred at 2:44 am according to my nightstand digitial clock, which I subsequently found to be about 15 seconds fast relative to WWV.  I do not know the time more precisely - there is no seconds indication on the clock.  The sound was not loud: it did not awaken my wife sleeping next to me, and I only heard it because I happened to be awake.  At first I thought it was the precursor rumbling to an earthquake, having experienced the 2001 magnitude 6.8 Nisqually quake.  When I realized that it was not being followed by shaking, I thought it must be a heavy jet transport leaving Sea-Tac airport.  We can occasionally hear those, although they typically do not depart at 3 in the morning.  Then I recall noting that the sound had a real feel to it, even though it was muted, and I could sense the pressure waves, not just hear the sound.  I went back to sleep thinking it might have been a distant earthquake.  The next morning, the 6 am local news mentioned that a number of people had reported lights and fireballs in the sky a few minutes before 3 am.  I did not see any lights, but I was not facing a North-facing window.  This sound may be connected to those sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor.  PD));47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439

I realized it was moving back and forth and up and down rapidly. I watched it do this for 20minutes before I woke my husband. He agreed that is was strange that it didn't move over a very large geographical area and that the movements were very erratic. Too erratic for a conventional aircraft. I did call the FAA and Kiro T.V. I had no way of takiing a photo of it so the televison station was not interested. We only saw 1 object and it had blue and white and red lights not all visible at the same time. It seemed to hover and then make short up and down and left and right movements.;47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439
Bright illuminated white clouds at night;2013-07-16 23:35:00;10 minutes;Bright illuminated white clouds at night.   My home faces west - stepped out on porch to look at evening clouds - not much light pollution here on this side of the island and normal low gray intermittent cloud cover was welcome after 2 hot days.   To the southwest we saw something I've never seen before.  VERY bright white clouds - first 1 large one hung in sky, moving in northwest direction, no flashes (not lightening) - entire cloud brilliant white against grayer clouds.  Eventually faded away.   Second bright cloud just to the south of the first moved into position of the first, and two VERY bright lights shined from it (like car headlights) - slowly illuminated to brilliant shine, lingered, then faded back.   Then three separate, much smaller, very bright lights actually came out of the southern tail of the cloud and circled around the shape of the cloud on that end.   This happened three separate times, with light following same flight path (curved around cloud).   Slowly the cloud then moved toward t! he north, gently fading away as it moved.   No more clouds of this type were seen after that.;47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439

When I looked at the back yard camera which is full of coyotes and woods there were all these lights popping out of nowhere.  I filmed it with my phone.  The coyotes screamed loud then silence nothing. My screen went blank.;47.6458771929824;-122.532870175439
