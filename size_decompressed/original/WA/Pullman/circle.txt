Bright blue explosion followed by blue shooting object over Pullman, WA;2006-10-01 20:24:00;less than 1 second;Bright blue explosion followed by blue shooting object over Pullman, WA In Pullman,WA on the Pullman Moscow Highway I was driving towards Pullman and just about to enter city limits. To the West (compass used) at about a 45 degree angle of vision, a bright blue circular object suddenly came into view with an explosion that light up the entire sky with whitish blue light. It flew at no more than a 10 - 15 degree angle relative to a VERTICAL line (down from left to right). It was almost flying straight down. It was only in view for about one full second before dissapearing again with no sound at all. The explosion of light only lasted a fraction of a second, but the movement and visual of the object itself carried on for a full second as it shot across the sky. Behind the object was a bright bue and white tail that spanned across its entire path of flight and was as thick as the object was wide. I would describe the size of the object as being that of a full moon or even a little bigger.;46.7315925781251;-117.1744328125
Orange orb.;2013-12-24 20:15:00;5 minutes;Orange orb round orange light (kind of glowing) with a brighter orange light just beneath  moving in a straight line parallel to the planes on their glide paths using the airport.  Watched for a few minutes as it got farther away it was harder to see the glow but the brighter light was still visible.  There was no sound at anytime.  Thought it might be a balloon but you can heart he burner when it is opened.;46.7315925781251;-117.1744328125
