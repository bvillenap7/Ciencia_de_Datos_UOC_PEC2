We stopped and looked up and saw what looked like a circle of light that consisted of many small individual lights (perhaps 8).  It seemed as if one or mre of the lights was of different color & blinking sporadically.   Trailing this main group of tightly grouped lights were approx 5-10 small lights to the south that seemed to be following the main group.   I was stopped in my vehicle with the window rolled down and asked several people that were still walking out of the stadium what they thought it was, and none of us had seen anything like it.   There were 40,000+ people at the game.  Many of them had to have seen the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Pullman, WA, UFO sighting.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet??  PD));2015-04-20 01:30:00;2 hours;Pullman, WA UFO Sighting As I'm lying in bed in my apartment, I see outside my window a really bright light, so I kept staring at it.  It was a fixed white light with a red flashing light right beside it, sometimes it looked like it was underneath the white light and sometimes it looked like it was to the side of it.  As if it was changing direction.   I first womdered if it was a planet because some flash colors but it started to move really fast up and down, and side to side.  I watched for two hours as it hovered and moved back and forth across the sky, to eventually disappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
