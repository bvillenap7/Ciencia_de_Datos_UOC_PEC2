It moved ;1999-04-05 08:20:00;3 minutes;A bright point-like light appeared in the evening sky (not yet dark enough for most stars to be visible much less satalites). It moved in a straight line across the sky heading west to east , and then sudenly vanished.  It was traveling very slowly (slower than most prop planes-less than 200 mph). It was a small blue ight.  I had just steped outside and saw it.  At first I thought it was a satalite.  But it was too bright as the sky was not that dark.  i called my girfriend outside, she saw it too and suggested it might be an airplane.  I am in the Air Force and I could tell that it wasn't behaving like a normal prop plane.  the single constant light, the percieved altitude (10,000 ft) didn't seem to be typical of the normal aricraft that are present in the area.She agreed that it didn't look like an airplane. She said, wow, I don't know what that would be.  I said that I was going to go down stairs to my apartment and look at it through my roomates binoculars.  the object was traveling slowly so I would have enough time.  I ran down stairs fumbled with the lock opened the door, grabed the binoculars (35x), and went out on the back deck(the object had traveled over the apartment by now).  I could hear my girlfriend discussing the object with her roomate on the deck above me.  I looked at the object through the binoculars and it didn't reveal anything more.  I saw no craft or airplane as I was half expecting to see.  It looked like a star would look under a telescope, just a point of blue light moving across the sky.  the poit was much sharper and smaller under the power of the binoculars but that was the only change.  I then reached up to the deck above and handed my girlfriend the binoculars and let her look at the object. when the object had traveled most of the length of the skyand was slowly moving away, it suddenly dissapeared.  It just faded out and was gone.  My girlfriend remarked, that was weird!  I said,  I think that was a UFO.  through out the event the object made no sound as the other aircraft in the area were.;46.7315925781251;-117.1744328125
Single object approached from the N-NW, Twinkled, sometimes emited red-blue-gold flashes, made 90deg. turn then hovered for 20 min.;2002-09-12 22:30:00;30min;Single object approached from the N-NW, Twinkled, sometimes emited red-blue-gold flashes, made 90deg. turn then hovered for 20 min. Object approached from the N-NW twinkled sometimes with red green or gold color. Comercial airplanes do not approach from this direction. Object moved towards the south/SE and made an abrupt 90 deg turn upward. Object apared to stop and hover. Ligh intensity did not deminish over 20 min of observation. Object appeared to hover but shift slightly in its position. As a comercial aircraft decended to the airport, object seemed to bob in the wake of the plane, but it also did not seem to be relativly near the plane, perhaps this was just light defraction. Object appeared to hover over the campus of WSU, but could have been much further away. There was only one object, shape unknown. I am a research technician at Washington State University, I am 35 years old, maried, and I have never seen anything like this. At first I thought the object was a military aircraft, or helicopter, but after it hovered for 20 min, I was certain it was no airplane. The next morning the University network was not functioning in the AM..perhaps unrelated.;46.7315925781251;-117.1744328125
6 balls of light over pullman washington Easter 2013;2013-04-08 20:00:00;5 minutes;6 balls of light over pullman washington Easter 2013 My friend was bringing me home after easter supper in downtown Pullman about 20:00 . When I got out of the car she said &quotoh look&quot we looked up and saw 6 yellow whitish glowing balls of light moving in a deliberate slow and lacksadaisical fashion across the sky above.there was no noise ,shadow,or varying movement at all.It was if as my friend said that they were Chinese prayer lanterns.. In theory it made perfect sense IF IT WASN'T traveling with such calm perfect synce across the sky . There was no variation at all as a group or together..It was eerily calm and undesturbed sight. 4 lights -- --  floated like this illustration above.with 2 more about 45 seconds behind - - like so.. They were below the horizon or cloud cover .We could see no form ,shadow,or device around the lights whatsoever;46.7315925781251;-117.1744328125
Red planetary looking object sighted near full moon in eastern sky above Pullman, WA;2013-10-18 17:30:00;10 minutes;Red planetary looking object sighted near full moon in eastern sky above Pullman, WA was just getting out of seeing a play a the Pullman Civic Theater and looked at the full moon.  Just below and to the right of the moon was what appeared to be a planet (was stationary) and red.   I asked my wife to get out a look at what I though was Mars.  Object/light was stationary.   I asked my mother to look as well...she looked out the windshield  at the light.   My wife and I continued to stand outside of our vehicle and look at it, when it began to move down from the position it was in, or possibly east.  It then began to fade in intensity and eventually disappeared.   I was near the corner of NW Nye St and NW Stadium way looking east over the top of Dissmores IGA store;46.7315925781251;-117.1744328125
