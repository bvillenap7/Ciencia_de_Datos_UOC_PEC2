Three dim yellow lights travel at high speed over central washington.;2002-06-01 22:45:00;5-10 sec;Three dim yellow lights travel at high speed over central washington. A dim yellow light, ~25 times the size of a star but half as bright, came from the north, traved ~3/4 of the way across the horizon then made a near angular turn and headed east. It was traveling so fast that when it turned east,(away from my vantage point), it was out of sight in about 2-3 seconds.  15 minutes later a similar craft crossed the sky from the northwest to southeast at the same speed. I observed a third craft moving from the northwest to the southeast about 10 minutes after the 2nd sighting. All 3 looked and flew the same;46.4196;-120.2676
Line of lights flying in orbit west to east equidistant over Yakima valley, Washington. (Zillah, WA);2020-05-04 21:30:00;~15+ minutes;Line of lights flying in orbit west to east equidistant over Yakima valley, Washington. (Zillah, WA) I stepped outside looked up when I noticed what looked like  a satellite coming from the west. It seemed to move a bit faster than a usual satellite and a little brighter.  My first thought was it was in a low orbit. As it passed over head it quickly faded out as it moved into the shadow of the earth.  A few minutes later I saw another one just like the first coming what seemed to be on the same trajectory fading out in the same position. It was then I saw others flying equidistant from one another  on the same trajectory as the first. You could see two to three at any one time something like C17s flying in a strait line.  This continued for about 10-15 minutes. I had been watching for a while before I got my old iphone noted the time and tried to take a picture which yeilded nothing.  The date is a close estimation.  I first tried to report the sighting a few days later but my computer was continuously  Tying s like someone was holding down the key i.e.   s! sssssssssssssssssssss.  If anybody else saw this it would be interesting to know.;46.4196;-120.2676
