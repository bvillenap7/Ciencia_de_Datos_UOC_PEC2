Sphere-shaped object with flame burning in center.;2014-06-13 22:45:00;3 minutes;Sphere-shaped object with flame burning in center. Night sky, partly cloudy, observed a globe shaped object, like a snow globe.  Looked like there was a flame in the middle of it.   It progressed from the northwest headed south east.    It moved slowly, then turned directly east, increased elevation rapidly and disappeared into the sky.   Strangest thing I have ever seen;45.7907;-122.5288
