I saw it by the north star at first looked like a cluster of stars but I saw it move from close to the north star to east of the sky in the few minutes until I showed somebody else.  The lights on each side would blink.  One on the left side would go dark then one on the right side would and then the opposite side would light back up again.  It was barely visible when it was close to the north star but when it went east it got really bright and very noticable.;45.7907;-122.5288
