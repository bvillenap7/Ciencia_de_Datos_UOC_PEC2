Swift disc shaped object with reddish-orange lights in Washington state;2013-07-07 23:30:00;<1 minute;Swift disc shaped object with reddish-orange lights in Washington state I was sitting on the front porch facing south towards the Columbia River when I saw 5 dull reddish-orange lights moving quickly on the horizon, like the lights on a craft.  They were unblinking, in a fixed position that appeared to be arranged on a disc shaped object that was only barely illuminated and visible.   The city lights were reflecting off the bottom of whatever this was more than it was being lit up by the lights that were on it.  There were also two “normal” airplanes, one heading southwest towards the Portland Airport that was fairly low and clearly audible, and another heading due north that was too high to hear. Both of those planes moved at what one would consider a steady rate and direction of travel for a typical airplane, lights blinking clearly even on the more distant one.   This object seemed to be at an altitude between these two, but moving in a serpentine line south and east very, very quickly and what was impossibly smooth given the rate of speed.   I’d say I’ve never seen anything move like that before, but this is the third time since January of this year that I have seen something unexplainable like this in nearly the same position in the sky.   The last two times my significant other was with me as well and was actually the first one to notice them. However, this was the first time the lights have been dull and reddish-orange, instead of bright and white.   We have seen a lot of planes coming and going, living near a major airport like we do, but neither of us have ever seen a plane that can move anywhere near this quickly, smoothly, or silently.  These make the fighter jets we see coming and going overhead occasionally look slow and clumsy.;45.7907;-122.5288
