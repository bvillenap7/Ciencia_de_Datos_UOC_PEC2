Fireball observed over Battle Ground, WA;2007-10-26 18:55:00;4 seconds;Fireball observed over Battle Ground, WA A sparkling point-shaped object was observed moving in a straight line, very fast, fairly close to the ground, at approximately the altitude that aircraft normally fly. There was no sound to be heard from the object. I felt that I was watching the last few seconds of flight before the object impacted the ground. It looked like a 'shooting star' only it was much closer than any one I have seen before. The object was moving in the South-West direction. It might have impacted in Vancouver, Washington. I live in Battle Ground, which is north-east of Vancouver.  This could possibly have been some sort of firework, but not one I have seen before. It was muving too fast to be conventional fireworks.;45.7907;-122.5288
Fireballs witnessed by 6 people over Battle Ground, Washington skies August 28, 2010;2010-08-28 22:00:00;3 minutes;Fireballs witnessed by 6 people over Battle Ground, Washington skies August 28, 2010 On Saturday August 28, 2010, our family was having a great evening watching the UFC 118 fights on Pay Per View.  When it got over, I took our dog outside for his nightly walk in the yard.  I looked up in the sky to the east of our house and noticed about 7 or 8 orange balls floating sporadically in the sky all heading to the south east. I quickly called to the rest of the family in the house where they all came running out to see what was outside. Everyone, 6 members, also saw the lights floating in the sky. The fireballs were originally floating at different levels and intervals, then continued floating in a semi-circle formation to the south east where after about 5 minutes of witnessing this, they just simply flickered out of sight. The sky was clear with no visible clouds.  The moon was nearly full.  The temperature was about 60 degrees with a very slight breeze.  No precipitation at all.;45.7907;-122.5288
Large orange ball phasing dim to bright;2013-08-09 21:15:00;5 minutes;Large orange ball phasing dim to bright I was watching the lightning storms east of my house, I looked up and saw a orange ball phasing bright to dim took about 15 sec to cycle thru.   It was about 35 to 40 degree I double check were jupiter was, and ISS was, but this was below the cloud cover.  It was also sitting still then making a oval pattern in the same spot in the sky for about a min.   Then it reappeared did the same thing over a period of 15 minutes...  I could see a center of mass when dim, it appeared to be a black arrow head in shape.   Meanwhile my cat was howling or screaming if that makes sense.  The lightning storms were over Samania county Silver Star mount area.   My line of sight was looking toward Larch Mountain from Battleground..   By the way I never seen my Cat act that way before.;45.7907;-122.5288
