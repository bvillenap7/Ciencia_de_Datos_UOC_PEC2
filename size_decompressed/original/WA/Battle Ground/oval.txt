Three round objects hovering over Battle Ground, WA;2012-05-12 21:03:00;3 to 4 minutes;Three round objects hovering over Battle Ground, WA May 12, 2012 @ 9:03pm  I was looking outside the sliding glass door to the West when I noticed one pinkish/red bright light in the sky.  It didn’t look like an airplane so I just continued watching it when another object appeared in the sky, fairly close together.  As those were moving westerly the third one appeared.  It also had a very bright pinkish/red light, almost fire like.   I called my fiancé to hurry and look at too.  The first two objects had moved out of eye sight rather quickly but the 3rd object hovered for a few seconds before moving Westerly.  The light was no longer visible but the object was.  I looked through the binoculars to view the object before it completely disappeared.  The object was dark, oval looking in shape.  My fiancé took photos as quickly as he could, hoping to get a shot of this odd object in the sky.;45.7907;-122.5288
