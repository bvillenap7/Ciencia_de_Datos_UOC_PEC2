Bluish green teardrop traveling through sky.;2018-12-14 04:00:00;1-3 seconds;Bluish green teardrop traveling through sky. Good Morning,  My name is ((name deleted)) and I have a UFO sighting to report.  It was 4 am this morning, just outside of Chewelah, Washington, while I was on the highway on my way home after work.  The skies were clear, and as I was coming around a corner on the highway, a big bluish green sphere lit up the sky as it traveled faster than anything I have ever seen.  It shot across the sky and covered many miles in a split second.   Iâ€™m not sure of the size exactly as it appeared to be very high, but when compared to the glimmer of stars and moon I would estimate this thing to have been about the size of a football field because of how clear it was.  Again it was extremely high so very difficult to gauge how exactly large but when compared to other objects in the night sky I would say very very large.   It covered the length of the sky in my vision in a matter of seconds so the traveling speed must have been amazingly fast.  Very very fast.   It gave off a blue glow and had a green trail behind it.  It reminded me of! a tear drop, but horizontally traveling through the sky.;48.2892;-117.7706
