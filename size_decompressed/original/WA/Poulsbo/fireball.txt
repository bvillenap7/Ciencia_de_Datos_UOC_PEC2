Large Green lighted object falling from sky.;2003-11-06 21:00:00;10 seconds;Large Green lighted object falling from sky. Driving from Poulsbo, WA to Kingston, WA we noticed a green light falling from the sky. It was very bright and falling much faster than a shooting star.  It seemed to leave a glowing trail behind it.  When it was out of site it seemed as though it would have landed a few miles away, it was very close.  The area we saw it in was mostly forestes with some occasional fields.;47.7438;-122.6265
