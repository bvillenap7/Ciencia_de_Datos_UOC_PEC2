Stationary large saucer hovering above Bangor submarine base. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Our  gym class in middle school had to use the high school track as we had none back then.  When crossing Hostmark road between the schools the very large saucer was gleaming in the sun.  It was a rare almost cloud free day.  It was hovering above Bangor submarine base I would guess.  I called my buddy back as he was 20 feet ahead of me asking what was that thing.  He and I walked back and forth across the road to gauge its distance...like when the moon seems to be following you when you were a kid in a car....know what I mean?  It was far away and shiny metallic like a newly machined part with a brilliant finish.  It had a large dome....almost half circle in the upper middle.  It had a real classic UFO shape.  At this time I had already seen the Goodyear blimps twice.  It looked nothing like a blimp.  I remember it like it was yesterday because it was shocking....and no reports in the paper!  It was AM so the sun was to our backs making this a fantastic view of the only shocking thing I have ever seen.  I am reluctant to (but could try) contact my buddy in case he does not remember, but I think he is in the area.  After we returned from the track the UFO was gone so I never saw it move...not even a millimeter.  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));47.7438;-122.6265
