The cat and I witnessed a flying, colorchanging circle.;2007-06-06 22:02:00;5 min;((NUFORC Note:  We do not know if this is intended as a serious report.  PD)) The cat and I witnessed a flying, color-changing circle. At About 10:02 pm, I brought my cat outside to go to the bathroom.   I don't know why, but I looked up at the sky.  What I saw scared both me and my cat, Fluffles.  We saw a light in the sky that hovered for a while, then changed directions, like in a zig-zag pattern.  It also changed colors from red to purple.  Then it lowered down behind some trees, back-lighting them.  It then came back up into the sky and flew away.  The next day, a family in the neighborhood was missing several cows.   I blame it on the UFO.;47.7438;-122.6265
