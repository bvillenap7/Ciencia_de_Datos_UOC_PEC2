Saw show on ufo's on tv last night, saw same shape over Puget Sound as the phoenix formation. I was driving back from a local mountain bike area and saw some lights in the sky. I thought that it was probably some of the local military boys on a night jump so I pulled over to watch. The formation was approximately 5 lights about one inch apart. They appeared to be several hundred feet in the air. The strange thing was that I saw no vapor trail from the flares I thought were burning. I watched about 30 minutes or so, but the lights never got closer or further from the ground (they appeared as if they were over the water). After about 30 minutes, I got bored and went home, never to think about it until I saw a show on tv last night about the lights that were seen over phoenix several years ago ( a cigar shape that was widely reported). What I saw resembled this same shape. May be a hoax. Wanted to find out if any other reports around this same time were investigated, if so what was it? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
