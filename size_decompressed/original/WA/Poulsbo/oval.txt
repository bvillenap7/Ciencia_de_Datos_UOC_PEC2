Bright falling oval in Poulsbo WA seen  one hour before  the 3rd of July fireworks display.;2011-07-03 21:26:00;3 minutes;Bright falling oval in Poulsbo WA seen  one hour before  the 3rd of July fireworks display. When I first noticed this bright spot in the sky over the Olympic mountains, I thought it might be a lenticular cloud, which I have seen often. When I noticed it becoming elongated, I photographed as much as possible and then took a movie.  It lasted approx. 3 minutes.  During the filming, it was noted that after a short time, a piece broke off and continued to fall.;47.7438;-122.6265
Yellowish/Orange oval sphere observed in Poulsbo, WA.;2013-06-22 21:30:00;1 minute;Yellowish/Orange oval sphere observed in Poulsbo, Wa. June 22, 2013, at approximately 9:30 pm, I was with a group of people who witnessed a “fire ball” cruising along above the harbor in Poulsbo, Washington. At first we thought it was possibly a Chinese type lantern with a candle inside that was flaming.  Then we realized that it appeared much too large at such a distance to be a lantern. We observed it for close to a minute when I decided to take a photo.  At that point the “fire ball” slipped into the forest surrounding the harbor. It wasn’t a “ball” it was oval in shape.  The oval was upright as it glided above the harbor.  There was no apparent fire, nor no fire reported as a result of this “fire ball” entering a highly forested area.;47.7438;-122.6265
