A vertical string of 3 orange globes suspended from one another moving at a slow rate. changing course and ascending out of sight.;2000-10-25 20:30:00;15 minutes;A vertical string of 3 orange globes suspended from one another moving at a slow rate. changing course and ascending out of sight. At the approximate time indicated, I observed what appeared to be a chain of three, bright orange globes attached to one another in a vertical plane. The object drifted from the north west in a south easterly direction until it was approximately over the middle of the body of water known as Liberty Bay here in Poulsbo. Its altitude was approximately 18,000'. When it reached the above point, the object changed direction to a south westerly heading and appeared to rise into the atmosphere until it disappeared behind the thin cloud cover. The objects speed was very slow as if it were being blown by upper level wind currents. However, as it changed course, it maintained a straight line thus discounting the possibility of its being influenced by those upper level winds. My background is one of approximately 20 years in general aviation with my current occupation being one of sales. I am in my late fifties. My wife, formerly a skeptic, also witnessed this phenomenon. She is in her late forties and a school teacher by trade. I contacted the local air route traffic control center and they in turn contacted Sea-Tac tower. The watch officer's return call indicated neither the center nor the tower had any traffic on their screens nor had they rec'd any visual contact reports. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and found his report to be quite convincing.  PD));47.7438;-122.6265
Indianola WA bright white streak across the sky March 19, 2020;2020-03-19 20:30:00;3 seconds;Indianola WA bright white streak across the sky March 19, 2020 We want to report a white streak moving very fast from north to south over Indianola/Poulsbo Washington about 8:30 p.m. on March 19, 2020.  It was bright and moving too fast for an airplane and did not look like meteor.  It did not move in an arc but straight across the skyscape.  Maybe other people saw this too.  It would be interesting to find out what it might have been.;47.7438;-122.6265
