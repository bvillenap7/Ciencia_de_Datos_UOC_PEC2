Large bright orb with smaller orb following behind it.;2019-07-26 23:18:00;2 minutes;Large bright orb with smaller orb following behind it. It was around 11:18PM, and my friends and I were hanging out outside when I see an orb appear out of nowhere in the west.  At first I thought it was Arcturus, but it got brighter and was moving towards me.  (I love astronomy, and am always looking up when I'm outside.) It was a bright light yellowish color, not blinking and no noise.  It was flying as close to us as a lower flying airplane, so I thought maybe it was a drone.   As it headed east and passed above us, we noticed there was a smaller orb following at the same speed behind it probably as far back as a plane's length or a little more.  It looked like the smaller orb was following it or being “towed.”  Again, no noise or blinking lights.  There was no deviation in its brightness.  I was able to grab a video on my phone but it only captured the larger or the two.  It kept moving east at the same speed, and we watched as it continued out of view.;47.7438;-122.6265
