The light would move left and right and up and down in small, seemingly uncoordinated actions.  There were different colors that were emitted...Green to Red to Orange.  The light was also emitted from the Corners of the object at 45 degree angles relative to the ground.    During the ten minute interval that the object was visable, there was a commercial aircraft inbound to Seattle vacinity that showed no difference to object.   Within a minute of the commercial aircraft, there was another aircraft that looked as if it flew withing a few hundred feet of the object and after passing the object, none of the aircraft light could be seen anymore.  This event was witnessed by two adults and four children.  Wow.;47.7438;-122.6265
