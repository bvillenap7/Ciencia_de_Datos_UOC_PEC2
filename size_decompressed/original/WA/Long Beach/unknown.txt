Additonal witness to Peter Davenport report of ufo from Long Beach, Wa.;2018-08-21 21:03:00;30 seconds;additonal witness to Peter Davenport report of ufo from Long Beach Wa Last night (8.22.18) while listening to Coast to Coast, I heard Peter davenport mention the witness' at Long beach that spotted a UFO.  I live about 2 miles south of the reported incident.  It was already dark out, due to the smoke from British Columbia and the marine air that pushed the fog onto the shore.   I was outside on my deck talking to my wife on the cell phone when I saw the craft moving north to south at about 60 degrees above the horizon.  There was no sound---just what appeared to be 4 red lights in a tight circular and or square pattern.  It didn't look like the typical lights pattern of a commercial or private aircraft.   I wasn't able to get my phone switched to video mode fast enough but did get one photo taken, which sadly doesn't do much justice to  what I way ((NUFORC Note:  My report on Coast to Coast on August 22, 2018, addressed a sighting in Long Beach, California, no Washington.;46.377;-124.0468
