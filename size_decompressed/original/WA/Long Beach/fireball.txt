I saw 3-4 oval in shape but a reddish orange color ufo's in the sky.  The glow was more like the light a candle would put off but of course much larger but that kind of a glow not like the light from a headlight or electric light bulb.  There is a large church a block to the east of me.  The church has a large steeple. the objectscame up from behind the church straight up and then moved at a slowish speed up about what I would say is maybe a half a mile and moved in a north west direction.  The objects came up one at a time and followed the exact pattern of the craft in front of it.   They stopped overhead of us and they just sat in the sky for several minutes.  Then they disappeared one at a time. the first one up dissapearing first then the second and then the third and so on.  If I had to compare the size I would say about the size of a vw bug.  It's hard to say because of the distance and the bright glow and of course I was very excited.   I was waving my arms at them and there was just one left in the sky and just before it disappered it flashed. and my husband/ boyfriend said wow it flashed at you.  I was so tripping on it .  I tell you,  it was great. There is no way this was a lantern or anything like that. the movments were percise and intentional.  There was no sound from these crafts at all. silent.  It was raining outside not very hard at the time.;46.377;-124.0468
