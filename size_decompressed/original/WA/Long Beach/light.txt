Four of us were on the beach late in the evening. The fog was so thick that we could hardly see. Then one of us saw a bright yellow light far out on the water moving south at quite a rapid pace. It was not bobbing in the waves (which were sizeable) as a boat would have, and it was too bright and moving too fast to be a large boat farther out. It was right on the water, not above the horizon. We observed it until it faded into the fog, then as we were leaving we saw it again moving north at the same speed.;46.377;-124.0468

Was not moving with the water -- straight line, very fast.  Moved south, disappeared, then reappeared a couple of minutes later moving north.  Moved south again, stayed visible for about 8 - 10 minutes.  Got a digital picture, but it's grainy, just shows a round light.;46.377;-124.0468
