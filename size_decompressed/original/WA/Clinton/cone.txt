The view from my bedroom is to the east across Puget Sound to Everett, a distance of about 7 miles.  I am up the hill from the water about Â½ mile. On October 7 2010 at 12:30 am I was in bed.  Looked at the door going out onto the deck and saw a very bright light in the sky.  It appeared to be between my house and the water at about 500 feet.  It was shaped kind of like the nose of an airplane.  This object was facing north and not moving. Looked  closer and at the south end of object was a vertical line also lit.  As I looked the line started vibrating and the thing shot straight up and out of my vision. The entire incident was only less than a minute. It had no red or green lights nor color of any kind.  Just a bright white light.  We have no street light and the neighborhood is very dark.  I have no idea what it could have been.;47.9489;-122.3871
