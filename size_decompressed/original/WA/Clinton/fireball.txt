Orange lights in the sky over Clinton WA on July 8, 2012 at 12:45+/- AM;2012-07-08 00:45:00;12 minutes;Orange lights in the sky over Clinton WA on July 8 2012 at 12:45+/- AM Walking home from local poker game, I looked up and noticed 3 very bright orange &quotstars&quot.  After about twenty seconds, another orange object moved toward the three stationary objects, at which time they all began to move.  They all then moved from northeast to southwest.  I got home and woke my 16 year old niece and my wife, who then observed 8 more occurrences of the objects appearing from the northeast, moving rapidly until just beyond our location, then slowing in speed and moving until out of sight.  I had observed 8 total objects before waking my family.  I did get one of the objects on video, but realized as I was filming that a bright light in the night sky doesn't really provide context for what is actually taking place.  The objects were completely silent, orange in color, and appeared to be very close, as their relative observed size changed quickly as they got closer then further away.  There was no flickering or other lights coming from the objects.  They appeared in roughly 30 second intervals, following the same course as the previous object.;47.9489;-122.3871
