Me, my husband and brother saw 3 round what looked like balls of fire in the sky, they were going pretty fast and they were orange.  We were all standing in a little field at 8:55 pm 10/3/13 when we saw them.  They didn't do anything but go in a straight line and then they fizzled out like coal in a fire would. 2 of them were flying at the same speed right next to each other and the third one was ahead of the 2 making a triangular shape.  They were flying from north to south.  They didn't make any noise and there were no trails behind them and they weren't blinking.  This lasted for about 4 minutes.
