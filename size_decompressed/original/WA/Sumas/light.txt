My husband and I were sitting in our hottub watching the sky. I noted that I had seen 4 satellites, all traveling north, 2 to the west and 2 to the east. We then observed another light that appeared like a very low, bright satellite traveling from the NW to SE. There was no sound (hot tub was off at the time), no flickering, just a steady, bright white light. The object was traveling beneath a low bank of clouds then it slowed down just before disappearing above the clouds (the same cloud bank it was beneath previously).;48.9736;-122.209
