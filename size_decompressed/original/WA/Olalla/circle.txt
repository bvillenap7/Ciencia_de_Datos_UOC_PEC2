Noticed strange electical screetches on audio equipment and looked up to see something  traveling fast and erratically.;2010-09-10 21:20:00;5-10 min;Noticed strange electical screetches on audio equipment and looked up to see something  traveling fast and erratically. This was at 21:20 on September 10, 2010 while two of my military buddies and I were on a paranormal investigation in the town of Olalla in Washington. The sun had gone down about an hour before and we were experiencing a lot of activity, including electrical failure with a lot of our equipment and extraordinary levels of EMF. We were sitting in our vehicle trying to figure out why the engine had died when a high pitch electrical screeching began.  At first we assumed the noise was emanating from some interference with our equipment, but we ran tests and found that this was not the case.  None of us could pinpoint the source of the sound. Suddenly,  in the pitch black, we saw a huge bright, white light in the sky.  I looked up and my first thought was that it was a planet or a comet.  But whatever it was moving too erratically.  It couldnâ€™t be a plane either, it was zipping across the sky at an amazing speed.  At first it whizzed in a fast Z-shape pattern before moving into a graceful arc right over our heads.  I could see that it was 3-dimensional, maybe a sphere, but the white light was too bright to know for sure.  It flew over our heads and disappeared behind some trees.  The car soon started and we drove out onto the road to see if we could follow it, but it had vanished. Luckily our video camera captured the whole thing.;47.4233;-122.585
