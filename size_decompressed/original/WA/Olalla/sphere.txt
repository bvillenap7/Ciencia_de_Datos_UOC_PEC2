False Moon.;2013-04-25 21:30:00;5 minutes;False Moon At about 9:30 maybe 9:45 pm PST, to the West.  I noticed a round object just below the tree line.  I believed it was the setting Moon, but seemed very low, but not to unusual.  I was watching  television and glanced over a few times, thinking how low the Moon was.  I was going to call my wife into the room to see it, she knows more about moon cycles than I do, but she was putting the baby to bed.  I left the room for about half an hour and the Moon was gone, normal.  Around 10:45 I noticed a light coming from my South window, to see a full moon moving in from the East.  The Moon in now in full view in my South window. I have no idea what the object was, but Orange in color, round and not moving.  It looked the size of a setting Moon, but hard to tell as the tree tops were in the way.  But very low on the horizon, if it were close possible half a mile away or less it would had to be less than 200 feet off the ground.  Oddly it feels like a false memory now, really can! ’t explain that. I do recall my dog barked that’s what made me look out the window and window on the door. Sorry I can not give you the accurate size.;47.4233;-122.585
