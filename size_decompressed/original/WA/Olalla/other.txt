While looking for meteors at 3am I observed a string of lights that looked like meteors  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-08-14 03:00:00;20 seconds;While looking for meteors at 3am I observed a string of lights that looked like meteors at first but moved slower and in a string.  One behind the other.  Some appeared paired where others were single but all following in a line across the Northwestern sky.  Seemed to come out of darkness (clear night) and returned behind darkness.  The whole event lasted 15 - 20 seconds (estimate).  I was too puzzled by what I saw I wasn’t timing it.  Much too high to be planes.  Perhaps satellites but never seen so many moving together in a string.  No reasonable explanation yet.  Have not seen any news reports yet either about this.  First time I’ve EVER seen something like this and first time EVER reporting such a siting.  Felt compelled to tell someone about it.  Definitely not a dream.;47.4233;-122.585
