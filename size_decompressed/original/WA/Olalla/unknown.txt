Blinding white flash.;2012-03-18 20:40:00;2 seconds;Blinding white flash. At 8:40 pm while driving home from the store my car was fully engulfed in a blinding white light.  It lasted only a couple seconds but left be blinded for two minutes.  I know this due to the fact that I had just glanced at the clock in the dash of the car just before the flash.  I slowed my car down, I did not pull off the road as there is a huge ditch and I could see well enough to stay on the road.  When I could see throgh the spots I was seeing the clock now read 8:42. I thought I might be having a stroke as my whole body felt very odd and drained.  When I arrived home my son and wife were standing outside, I asked if they had seen the flash, my son said the sky lit up like daytime for a second, but no sound or explosion was heard.  They thought a transformer must have blown. I related my story to them.  It took well over an hour for my sight to return to almost normal.  Today my eyes are stinging some and they dont focus as fast as normal.  I can not find anythi! ng online about anyone else seeing this last night.;47.4233;-122.585
