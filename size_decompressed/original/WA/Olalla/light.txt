I was sitting on the deck at approximately 9:30 p.m., when I saw a bright green light moving in what appeared to be a south to north trajectory.   The light appeared to be a bluish-green ball with a trailing tail, like a falling star.   At first glance it was like a firework, however, it was much larger, brighter, and moved much further than any firework I have ever witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time to 21:58 hrs., predicated on a very accurate measurement of time by one of the witnesses.;47.4233;-122.585
