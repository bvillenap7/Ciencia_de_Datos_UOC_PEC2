It was round and emitted orange light that pulsed.  It flew Northwest a short distance & stopped, hovering about 1.5 mins.   Then made an ascent into cloud cover.  The craft made no noise.  It glowed as if it were on fire.  Absolutely no blinking lights as aircraft we have in service.   I called out for my son-in-law to come view the light w/his son in tow.  Didn't know what to make of it.;47.7305;-117.0624
