Description:  Strobing white light connected to pinkish/red stacked balls (on top of each other) no sound. As first one was over Buckley, a second one appeared and followed behind for approx. 3 seconds then disappeared.  Lights were larger and clearer than commercial jets, and it was flying lower.  Dogs were barking which made me think that there was a high pitched sound that I could not hear. It followed partially a military flight pattern that is used sometimes by our home.
