Triangular objects with blue, white, and red lights, very bright strobes in unison along with bigger white lights at 3 points;2001-10-19 20:05:00;25 seconds;Triangular objects with blue, white, and red lights, very bright strobes in unison along with bigger white lights at 3 points Slow-moving objects, almost due South direction, slightly above low broken cloud cover. Objects approx. one mile apart, one trailing back about 60 degrees off left (East) of other.  As stobes flashed, faint outline appeared to reveal solid triangle, rather than conventional wing.  Altitude guess 1500 feet.  Distinct bright red, blue, white lights in line on trailing edge of both.  No red or green strobes in conventional positions.  No landing light or similar typical arrangement.  Not at all the typical type of arrangement, as I'm accustomed to light airplane traffic from three grass airfields in area, commecial traffic to and from SeaTac, and military traffic to McCord AFB.  Still could be mistaken, but not familiar with this arrangement. No engine noise apparrent.  Commercial flight from SeaTac at approx. 2020 hours with take-off lights and conventional configuration of lights flew over just West of my house, well above other objects' flight altitudes, engine noise very clear.;47.1489;-122.0717
