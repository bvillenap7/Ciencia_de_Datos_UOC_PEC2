Strange lights in the Duvall night sky Sept 13, 2001;2001-09-13 22:30:00;15 minutes;Strange lights in the Duvall night sky Sept 13, 2001 My husband and I came home from dinner and I looked to the west as I got out of our car. I noticed a red flickering light and asked my husband if it was a planet. He said no and we both assumed it was an airplane. The weird thing was that it wasn't moving and it definately had a strange light pattern. My husband brought out his telescope and managed to get it in the sights. There was a bright white light and seemingly colored lights (red, blue, green) appeared to swirl around the white light. The craft was completely stationary from what we could tell.  It did eventually move further west very very gradually. An airplane of some sort (seemed like a commercial airliner) did fly from east to west directly over the craft.  The reason my interest was piqued at all was that a friend told me she saw a ufo the night before in the Duvall sky so I was keeping an eye out for anything unusual.  My husband, who's very skeptical, even seemed to think that the craft was something highly unusual. Not your normal airplane definately. ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to know whether the object disappeared from sight after the 15 minutes of observation indicated by the witness.  If it remained in the sky indefinitely, our first suspicion would be that they may have been observing a twinkling star.  PD));47.725;-121.9369
