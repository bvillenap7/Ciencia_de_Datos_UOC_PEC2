The lights were off in the house. I have lived in this same house for over 10 years and never saw anything unusual until last night. I suddenly noticed an egg shaped ball of light that looked like it was glowing a solid yellowish color. It was moving very straight accross the sky but only about 40 feet from the ground and at about the speed of a slow hellicopter. It was getting blocked by a tree so I bolted for the door with my binoculars and looked at it from there. I didn't get a chance to get the binocs out of the case before it continued out of sight behind more trees. There are pretty tall trees here and it looked like it was only about one fifth down from the top of the trees. There are few trees behind the first row so it would have plenty of space to travel, but I know no manmade plane or copter would fly so low day or night. The light of this thing was very bright but seemed self contained and didn't shine toward the ground. Also, while at the door I heard no sound in the still night air. The size of the thing is hard to say but I was only about 100 yards from it and it looked like it was as big as a small plane. This was in the vicinity of Lake Marcell about half way between Duvall and Carnation.
