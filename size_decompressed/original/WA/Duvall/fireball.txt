Saw the eggshaped fireball again !;2001-03-07 01:04:00;20 sec;Saw the eggshaped fireball again ! Check my former post on Feb 28, this was a repeat performance down to the last detail! I was again listening to Art Bell on the radio, lying in bed gazing at my window with all my lights out when I saw a large ball of light moving accross the sky very low just over the trees outside. I ran quickly to the door and watched as it moved. It was only visible at that point inbetween the tree tops but each space affording a clear view. It was yellow/orange and seemed very lively like it was pulsating the colors I saw. There was no sound at all. This was very intense! Something sooo real about it .....no fantasy for sure.;47.725;-121.9369
