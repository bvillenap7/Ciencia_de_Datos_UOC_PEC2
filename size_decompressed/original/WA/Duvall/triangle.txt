Three bright lights in the sky, possibly above the Novelty Hill area of Redmond, WA.;2008-11-23 09:20:00;5 minutes;My family and I saw three bright lights in the sky, possibly above the Novelty Hill area of Redmond, Washington, which is approximately twenty miles east of Seattle.  We noticed these lights during our drive home, on Sunday night at 9:20 p.m.  The lights appeared to be attached, yet possibly hundreds if not thousands of feet apart.  They appeared to be moving, at least maybe one of them.   We saw at least a couple planes in the sky also, but these lights definately looked very different.  We pulled over and watched for about five minutes, then in attempts to drive to a spot where we could more clearly see we lost track of it.;47.725;-121.9369
The bright red object moved at speed from one place to enother then stop and started again - with no sound at all.;2011-09-06 21:30:00;5 min;The bright red object moved at speed from one place to enother then stop and started again - with no sound at all. My husband and I were sitting watching TV when we saw a bright red blurry light in the sky, almost like a triangle in shape.  It was flying lower than an aircraft and was not following the normal flight pattern for the area.  There was also no sound to it.  We watched it for about 5 minutes as it hovered and then moved.  Then it just disappeared.  GONE-;47.725;-121.9369
