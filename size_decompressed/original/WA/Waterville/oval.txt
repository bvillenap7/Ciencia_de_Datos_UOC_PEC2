fast rice shaped craft seen;2010-08-14 15:00:00;5-7seconds;fast rice shaped craft seen Hello, On aug.14th, 2010, at approx.3:30pm, sunny calm sky’s I was working on my cabin, located at the top of Badger mountain, Douglas county, Washington state, elevation 4160feet, when I saw something out of the corner of my eye flying over head at a very high rate of speed, much, much faster than any airplane, it was whiteish, metallic looking, and it looked kinda like a piece of rice, I think because of the distance between me and it,  I’m thinking about a half mile to a mile away,  it was really moving, never seen anything like it, have you ever heard of other reports from the area, I have heard of the Waterville spook lights, but this was in daylight.  it defiantly looked like some sort of craft with no wings, and no contrail, moving at a very high rate of speed.;47.6295;-119.9887
