Disk flew over raodway, unlit except from reflection of car lights;1998-11-14 19:30:00;5 seconds;Disk flew over raodway, unlit except from reflection of car lights I was traveling on rd. 24 sw about 9 miles east of Mattawa on Saturday evening, 11/14/98. My brother and I had been pheasant hunting all day in the Clarkston area. I would not have seen the disc except that my headlights and the headlights of an oncoming car reflected off of it's surface. The oncoming car and mine were going to meet each other at the top of a small rise. As our headlights were pointed up the rise, they reflected off of a disc shaped object. My brother was asleep, and I did not have time to wake him. The disc was slowly moving from right to left. It was the color of wet, smooth concrete, and about as wide as the road.  Ido not know if the other car saw it or not. I went back to the same spot the next day and there was nothing haning over the road that I could have mistaken for what I saw. We drove directly underneath it (it was probably 30 feet above the road). By the time I stopped, I could not see it.;46.7282;-119.7742
