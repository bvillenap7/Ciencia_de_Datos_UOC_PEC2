Gold fireball with tail, broke up, but continued downward close to Hanford Nuclear Site.;2002-08-28 02:30:00;6 or 7 seconds;Gold fireball with tail, broke up, but continued downward close to Hanford Nuclear Site. Saw a large fireball coming straight down gold like flames and short tail.  With arm extended, the size of 'female' thumbnail.  Surprisingly, it broke up into six or seven pieces, not exploding, but pieces stayed close together and continued downward.  Perhaps space debris?  I lost sight of it behind trees.  Concerned me, because it looked like it was coming straight down on Hanford Nuclear Site, 20 miles from us, but probably further South, Southeast.;46.7282;-119.7742
