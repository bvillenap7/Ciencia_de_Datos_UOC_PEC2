Long cylinder of lights over Eastern Washington.  ((Starlink satellites??));2021-03-11 05:00:00;45 seconds;Long cylinder of lights over Eastern Washington At approximately 4:55 a.m. on Thursday, March 11, 2021 I was outside looking at the night sky. It was very dark with bright stars when I saw a long cylinder of bright lights coming from the Southwest headed to the Northeast. At first I thought it was a really bright shooting star, but soon realized it wasnâ€™t. It stayed at a constant slow speed and did not have a tail like a shooting star would. I woke my husband and he saw it as it passed almost over our home, about the height it seemed of a low flying military carrier might. We both described it as a long straight tube with about a dozen circular lights in it. It was not one solid light, there was space between each bright light within the cylinder. Relating it to things we know, it looked like a piece of rope light that was perfectly straight moving through the sky. It lasted around a minute and a half and disappeared over the Northeast horizon .;46.7282;-119.7742
