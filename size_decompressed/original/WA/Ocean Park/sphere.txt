Bright red light observed over Southwest Washington coast by 2 people;2012-06-30 22:10:00;2 minutes;Bright red light observed over Southwest Washington coast by 2 people We first noticed the object about 20 degrees above the WNW horizon and traveling in an arc in the direction of ESE, slightly curving to the South.  It was round and bright red, and made no noise.   When we used our binoculars to view it, we could not distinguish any more definite characteristics.   The object was visible for more than a minute before disappearing overhead behind a light cloud cover.    The wind at that time was four miles per hour from WNW.;46.5055;-124.0415
6 orange fireballs travel slowly across the southwestern WA night sky.;2012-07-04 22:30:00;3 minutes;6 orange fireballs travel slowly across the southwestern WA night sky. Two of us saw 6 orange, pulsating, orbs rising from the ocean or the horizon in the WNW, ascending to about 60 degrees above the horizon and traveling slowly to the SE before fading from view.  When viewed in binoculars and in a telescope, the objects appeared to be like burning fireballs.  The first orb rose and traveled to near overhead by itself.  A few minutes later, four orbs rose in succession, spaced about 10 degrees apart traveling in the same path as the first, heading SSE  After they disappeared, a sixth orb traveled in the same path.  The wind at the time was from the NE, 1 to 3 mph.  The night was clear and the objects made no sound.;46.5055;-124.0415
