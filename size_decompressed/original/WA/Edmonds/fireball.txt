Dark orange light in northern sky moves forward then away and drops quickly out of sight;2012-05-21 22:30:00;20 seconds;dark orange light in northern sky moves forward then away and drops quickly out of sight i was facing north, looking at the big dipper. i saw a red light that looked like it was about the height of a commercial airliner, but the size of 2 airliners' lights. it was headed south. i said to my two fellow observes, 'hey, look!', and pointed to the fireball/light that i saw. when i first saw it, it looked like it was traveling toward us, but by the time i alerted my fellow observes, it was stationary.  when they looked at it, it began to travel northwards (away from us).  and it began to dim. i lost track of it, but my fellow observes noted that it appeared to burn out / get darker and flicker / pulse.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Orange sphere, with red aura and orange rays glowing out if it. It lasted about 2- minutes, amazing.;2012-07-05 23:00:00;2 minutes;Orange sphere, with red aura and orange rays glowing out if it. It lasted about 2- minutes, amazing. 07/05/2012   This is an account of what I believe to be a UFO- sighting by me, Carrie Jackson. I was  on my balconey at approximately 11:10 on 07/05/2012 to smoke a cigarette.  As I was outside, I was looking up to watch the stars, and all of a sudden a very large, bright orange, round object came over my apartment from the North.  It had a red aura around it and it also had orange rays coming out of it all around the ball.  I was extremely bright. I know it was not an airplane.  It didn't blink, it made no sound and it glowed.   As I was watching it, it continued to go to the South.  It descended  a little bit, and then it was somewhat obstructed by a large tree that is in front of my apartment.  I could still see it, but I had to stretch to.  It then made an upward, gentle turn to the left and I then couldn't see it any longer.  The whole event lasted about 2-minutes.  It was unbelievable.  I am still in shock. Thank you;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
