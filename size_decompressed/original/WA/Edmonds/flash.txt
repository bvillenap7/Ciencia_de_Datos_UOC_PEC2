I noticed an unusually bright light traveling rapidly through the upper atmosphere. I pointed it out to my girlfriend and commented it must be an aircraft flying high with a very bright light. The light looked more like a bright star than an actual aircraft light. The craft then suddenly appeared to be in space and the light was very faint and traveled in the same direction at a much slower rate, much like the way a satilite looks. The craft slowed down to a conplete stop for a few moments and then continued on slowly and then stopped again. The craft then held constant for several minutes and slowly disappeared.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408

Quick moving and incredibly bright multicolored flashing lights seen in sky appearing to travel at great speeds.;2012-08-26 22:00:00;1 minute 30 seconds;Quick moving and incredibly bright multicolored flashing lights seen in sky appearing to travel at great speeds. My friend and I were outside having a cigarette at 10:00pm,  Aug 25th, 2012, when I had noticed a small formation of strobe like lights in the northern section of the sky. There were three of them in total. What struck me was I know what a beacon light on an aircraft looks like, and what I saw was not like any beacon light I have ever seen in my life. The objects seemed very distant, and high up. They displayed a multicolored strobe effect producing a white flash (most frequent), a blue flash (displayed this color maybe three times), and a red flash (only one of the three objects flashed red).  On none of the objects was the flash timed. There was no beat so to speak. The lights flashed without rhythm. What struck me is that they appeared very far up and far away yet their flash was powerful.  One by one the objects disappeared except the last two seemed to stay stationary at one point, then too proceeded across the sky quickly.  They all moved across the sky and due to the great distance, I imagine were traveling very quickly. When the objects moved across the sky they would disappear and reappear, being visible  by their flash. This sighting occurred over the sky's of Everett and Mulkeleteo Washington.  Possibly even farther North, I am not confident in judging where the objects appeared exactly.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
