I was looking up at the moon and out of the corner of my eye I observed a florescent  cigar shape object heading north west direction.  When the thing I was looking at separated in to two of them they continued to travel in same direction for a few seconds then one went east the other continued in a northwest direction then disappeared it was like the things I was looking at were skipping on air in some way.   The background of the night sky was pretty clear, a few clouds were out.  It did not look like a plane or anything that I have ever seen man-made.  Not to say it wasn't;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
