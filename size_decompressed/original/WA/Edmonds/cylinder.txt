Iâ€™m a male, 59 years old, my occupation is a Planner/Buyer and my son is 31 years old and a software test engineer.  The night of July 4, 2010 at approximately 10:25PM  my son and I both observed 2 individual orange glowing, slow moving objects flying about 1,000 feet above our house.  They appeared to be travelling approximately 50 miles an hour.  The objects travelled from North to South in a straight line about 2 minutes apart and about 1,500 feet apart.  They appeared to be cylinder in shape. No discernable noise or sounds of any kind did either one of us hear from these objects. Nothing we had ever seen before.  They then disappeared as if fading into the night sky.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
