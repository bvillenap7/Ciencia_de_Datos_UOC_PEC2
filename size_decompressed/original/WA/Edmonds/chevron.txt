DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THIS?  It's a beautiful clear day in the Seattle area - and this thing had to have been seen by hundreds of people?  Please imagine a black boomerang shaped like a U flying across a bright blue sky. The Boomerang was definetly flying in a easterly direction and therefore would have a tail section in front it and behind it.  It was not flying away from us or banking against the skyline.  There were no lights, no sound-and it was amazingly fast and low - my guess is that it was the size of a 737 aircraft - and flying at about 1000 feet, would love to know if anyone else saw this - please e-mail matchpoint19@yahoo.com.  I am a former Law Enforcement Officer, my wife is a former Flight Attendant and both feel that we are credible witnesses to this event.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
