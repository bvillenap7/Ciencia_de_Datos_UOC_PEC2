day light sighting of a dark triangle;1997-07-16 17:20:00;20 mins.;day light sighting of a dark triangle I was just headed out to go see my dad. ok I was bowling with him on a league.  I was walking to the store to get some smokes and I was watching crows fly over head. The crows fly over head every day at that time. So I was checking the birds out and I noticed one was not moving.  The day was mostly clear and the object was easy to see. It was still and dark with no lights(day light) I could not see lights anyway.  I looked at it for a couple of minutes when I figured I better get someone out here so I would not look like a freak talking about a ufo! Which I did anyways!  So I grabbed a salesman at my work and we both looked at it for a couple of minutes.  He ended up getting paged and I was left alone to look at it.  I decided I better go to the corner store and get some smokes for bowling. When I got there I was in line talking about what was up in the air about 3000ft I guess. after I told a guy and the guy that worked there we all left the store to look at it. it was still there after all that time.  the guy that worked there yelled something(arabic) and went back in!  the other guy just was amazed and told me he always wanted to see one and now he has! I left back to my work which was just a couple of hundreds of feet away so I could leave because I was supposed to be with my dad soon for bowling. So as I walked back I was thinking of grabbing a camera the one that we use to take pictures of customers when they buy a car. but I figured I would take too long looking for it and I wanted to look at it a bit longer.  As I looked at this dark triangle I noticed the bigger end looked like it had sharper wing like ends to it. It didn't move this whole time. It just sat there over highway 99 and just was quiet and still as can be.  One thing I noticed was when I took my eyes off of it, it was hard to find right off.  It was clear to see when looking at it but you take your eyes off it for a second you had a little bit of focusing you had to do. I looked at it one last time and I must have blinked because it was gone!  just a slight vapor spot not strip like you see with jets.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Triangle (100-150' per side) w/ three bright lights travelling about 20MPH at 200-300' AGL (above ground level).;2003-03-16 19:30:00;30 seconds;Triangle (100-150' per side) w/ three bright lights travelling about 20MPH at 200-300' AGL (above ground level). I was just returning from the beach with my Golden Retriever when I noticed what looked like two bright landing lights coming at me.  I am a pilot and was wondering why they were flying so low.  They were about 1 mile away at an altitude of 200-300' AGL (just above tree level) traveling in a Northwesterly direction.  I watched for about 20 seconds when I noticed that there was actually three bright lights and that they were on the bottom corners of a black triangle (about 100-150' to each side).  I was standing in the middle of a park (large open space), with the craft heading straight for me.  At that moment, I decided that I would not want to become an abductie statistic and said out loud I'm not ready for this!, so I quickly made my way to the closest trees for some cover (a 10 second dash).  I looked back and it was gone.  The craft should have been there.  It was as close as 200-300 yards and traveling at about 20 MPH with no sound.  This happened about 5 miles south of Paine Field - my home airport, with-in their Class D airspace.  Upon returning home, I opened your web site to see if there were any other sightings like mine.  To my amazement, I found on your home page exactly what I saw.  It was the incident on January 24, 2003 near Kingston, Ontario, Canada only she had more guts than I did.  I have contacted Paine Field Airport Management and they are researching their radar tapes and talking to the tower personnel for that time period.  I will keep you advised.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Follow-up on triangle sighting.;2003-03-16 19:30:00;30 seconds;Follow-up on triangle sighting. Follow up:  I failed to mention on my original report that the object did not have any normal aircraft lighting ie: red beacon, white anti-collision strobes, nor red or green running lights, only three bright white lights on the bottom of the craft near each of the three corners.  I have further heard back from the people at Paine Field Airport in regards to their findings on the radar tapes.  No radar returns for that given area (5-DME on the 180 radial from their VOR) during atleast a one hour time frame.  In fact, they thought it very strange that there were NO radar returns for anything south of the airport including the standard southerly or westerly approach patterns for the main runway 34L/16R.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Triangle over Edmonds;2004-09-20 22:00:00;+/- 2minutes;Triangle over Edmonds This is from what my husband saw.  He was outside on our lawn with the dog.  He was watching a small plane fly overhead when he suddenly saw a triangle shaped object fly up to the small plane, hover there for a bit, then turn and fly at great speed in the opposite direction.  I was inside and all I heard was Oh wow, oh wow from my husband.  The night was clear and there were lots of stars visible, but this was not any star!

Triangle craft seen in Edmonds;2006-03-15 19:00:00;5-7 minutes;Triangle craft seen in Edmonds My daughter and I were driving south and we noticed a triangle of lights coming toward us.  We stopped at a stop sign and turned left.  As we did, my daughter noticed that the craft turned sharply and was now parallel to us. We caught a glimpse of the underside and it was a black triangle with white lights on each corner and a red light in the center. It then turned right and then right again, making a loop around the area.  We drove up to a school on a hill and saw the object as we drove.  When we got to the school, the craft had disappeared.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
A triangle craft spotted in Edmonds washington.;2007-02-13 22:00:00;1min;A triangle craft spotted in Edmonds washington. I was driving down Edmonds way(highway 104) around 10:00 pm to pick up some beer when i saw a triangle shaped object in the west sky. It was dark so all i could see was the light which glowed a light blue-white color. It seem to be pasted against the west sky like a giant less than sign >. It was really strange, from just looking at it for a second i could tell that it wasn't natural.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
