Large bright white oval ball of light hovering over lynnwood or edmonds on 1/26/01 around 10:30 pm;2001-01-26 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;Large bright white oval ball of light hovering over lynnwood or edmonds on 1/26/01 around 10:30 pm As i was coming home from a friends house i turned onto my street and through my windsheild up above the tree line , i saw a bright white glowing object. I was intstantly stunned by how bright it was. It 's as if it was above my house, because i was heading directly home and the object seemed to be directly in front of me. As i drove up my street the object seemed to sort of bob up and down but didn't appear to be moving laterally. As i rushed down the street and pulled into my driveway, i stopped my car and jumped out to run out to the street to see it, and it was  gone.  This object seemed to almost eminate this soft bright white light in a pulsating, circular way . It was brighter and purer of a light than i've ever seen. I was very large in the sky, about the size of two full moons, but more oval. It was also completly silent out. If it were a helicopter or aroplane at that distance there would of been sound. And it couldn't have vanished in the time i went from my car to the street. Which would have been about 3 seconds. I stood in the street waiting for it to return for about 15minutes, but it never returned. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the sighting might have been caused by Venus.  Just a guess.  PD));47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
20-30 orange, flame colored objects seen for 15 minutes by 20 persons.;2010-03-13 19:15:00;15 minutes;20-30 orange, flame colored objects seen for 15 minutes by 20 persons. The report is a second-hand account of the below witness’ experience. On Saturday, March 13, 2010, at 7:15 p.m, a witness reported a number of orange colored circular objects were seen for about 15 minutes in Edmonds, Washington State.  Eventually, a group of about 20 persons in a large apartment complex gathered to witness these movements. First some background explanations, the witness used the term “low” to mean that the orange objects were larger than the stars in the sky, so the witness felt like they were at a lower level.  These objects were not close to ground level.  Also, the apartment complex pool is used as a reference point to describe the movement of these far. way objects The witness reported that initially 3-4 objects that looked like the color of fire were coming in “low”, moving from south to north. Then one orange circular object broke away this initial group.  This single orange object moved further north until it was seen over the apartment complex pool.  Then, after a few seconds that object disappeared. During this time, the witness said “little by little” other orange objects kept moving from the south to north, and when they got by the pool they disappeared. The approximate viewing time was said to be 15 minutes Then the sky was clear. The witness guessed there were more than 20 orange objects, but not more than 40. Approximately 20 people in the complex saw these orange objects.  Many were out because they were smoking.  They attracted more viewers because they were saying loudly, “Look up in the sky!”.  The witness went outside because the dog was barking and upon checking outside the apartment the third time the witness saw this group of people looking orange objects in the sky. It was reported from another person in the apartment complex that the emergency phone number 911 was called. The 911 operator was reported as saying that a massive amount of calls were received from all over.  Some of the questions asked by the 911 operator were:  “Was anything burning?   Did it hit anything?  Where did it come from?”  It was also reported that the 911 operator said  that a request would be put out for cars out investigate.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
