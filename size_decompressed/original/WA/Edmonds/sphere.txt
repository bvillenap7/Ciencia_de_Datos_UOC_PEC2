5 reddish spheres with flashing lights floating noiselessly not far offshore of Edmonds at maybe 1000 feet.;2010-10-29 19:00:00;10 minutes;5 reddish spheres with flashing lights floating noiselessly not far offshore of Edmonds at maybe 1000 feet. Friday, October 29, 2010 Time: about 7pm Edmonds, WA  Perhaps you have some other reports of this and maybe know what I actually saw, but here is a brief description. I was out walking the dog after supper close to 7pm. When we started the walk around some of the condo clusters at Point Edwards in Edmonds I noticed a reddish light in the westerly direction over the Olympics in about the usual location for an inbound commercial flight. It looked a little odd because of the predominate reddish sort of glow and slightly larger than usual size and lack of apparent movement (which is not uncommon when you see a jet coming in from the west). I thought it was a little odd but figured it was just another airliner and continued the walk. About 5 minutes later when I rounded the easterly corner of the complex and turned back in a westerly and then southwesterly direction I was surprised to see 4-5 “glowing red spherical lights” coming from the south, maybe a mile south of the Edmonds breakwater. I thought they were probably helicopters at first, although unusually lit, as their motion resembled that of helicopters. There were white and red flashing lights in what seemed a spherical shape. The lights appeared less than a mile off the shoreline and maybe at an altitude of about a thousand feet. What really caught my attention was a total lack of noise. The lights seemed to float in a loose formation slowly north and then turned west, slowly gaining altitude. They were about the size of my thumbnail held at arms length when not far off the south end of the Edmonds breakwater. One of the lights that turned west before the others disappeared while I was watching. I went back to my condo for binoculars but the lights were gone when I got back outside. A car with a family in it came by while I was watching the lights and the driver stopped and asked me what the lights were but neither of us had a clue. The evening was clear, the sky dark, and the major stars easily visible. Observer: male, 63, MBA degree, former pilot, hunter, businessman, sailor.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408

The objects where about the size of a quarter and appeared to gain altitude as they rose from the southwest.  They move at a steady rate toward the northwest until they disappeared one by one, (perhaps because of cloud cover.  They did not have the typical green and red airplane running lights. Definitely UFO's as they were unidentified.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Unknown object travels North to South through Pegasus constellation.;2012-08-12 10:04:00;4 minutes;Unknown object travels North to South through Pegasus constellation. Traveling North to South through the constellation Pegasus, a low lit sphere, seemingly very high altitude traveled at a relatively swift pace for it's altitude, and completely disappeared towards the end of the Pegasus constellation.   It's light just completely vanished.  If it were a satellite I would imagine it to continue on it's course and not disappear.  If it were an aircraft turning in flight so its main lights were not in my line of sight then that might make sense except for it's extremely high altitude and usually after a certain amount of time it would re-appear.  It also made no obvious course corrections.  It maintained constant brightness so it wasn't a flying lantern.  Object is unknown.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
	Bright green orb, very large shooting downward at extremely fast speed.

Bright green orb, very large shooting downward at extremely fast speed.  Movement, trajectory, all how I would think a fireball would travel without the fire.   It disappeared behind trees & I expected an explosion when it hit the ground but nothing.   It was larger than what I think a meteor would be but that's my best guess.  Early evening but sky quite bright. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
