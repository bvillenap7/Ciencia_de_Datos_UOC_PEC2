STAR LIKE OBJECT TRAVELING ACROSS THE SKY. STOPPED AND SUDDENLY WINKED OUT.;2010-10-29 18:00:00;ONE MINUTE;STAR LIKE OBJECT TRAVELING ACROSS THE SKY. STOPPED AND SUDDENLY WINKED OUT. MY GIRL FRIEND AND MY SELF WERE ON HER DECK AT HER HOME IN EDMONDS WASHINGTON OCTOBER 29TH., 2010.  WE ARE INTERESTED IN ASTRONOMY AND TONITE WHILE LOOKING AT THE STARS SHE POINTED TO A STAR LIKE OBJECT AND MENTIONED COULD THAT BE A SATELITE?   I SAID YES, IT WAS TRAVELLING PRETTY FAST.  BUT THEN I REALIZED TO FAST TO BE A SATELITE, MUTCH, MUTCH TO SLOW TO BE A COMET OR METEORITE.  IT TRAVERSED THE SKY A GOOD DISTANCE (HALF THE SKY'S ASMUTH), IN A STRAIGHT LINE THEN STOPPED.  WHEN IT STOPPED IT SEEMED TO CHANGE COLORS (IT WAS AS IF LIKE LOOKING AT BINARY STAR), AND THEN WINKED OUT.   I WATCHED A HIGH FLYING PLANE IN THE AREA TRACE THE SIMILAR FLIGHT PATH TO DETERMINE IF PERHAPS SOME CLOUD COVER CAUSED THE SUDDEN DISSAPEARENCE.  IT REMAINED VISIBLE DURING ITS FLIGHT PATH AT WHAT I ASSUMED TO BE A RELATIVELY SIMILAR HIGH ALTITUDE. THE WEATHER FOR TONITE HAS BEEN CLEAR WITH STARS VISIBLE TO SOMEWHAT CLOUDY. THE AREA THE THE UFO DISAPEARED IN WAS CLEAR OPEN SKY. I HOPE WHAT WE SAW MIGHT HAVE BEEN VIEWED BY OTHERS IN OUR HEMISPHERE. I ENJOY ASTRONOMY AND FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT IN IDENTIFYING CELESTIAL BODIES HOWEVER TONITE I HAVE NO EXPLANATION TO WHAT WE BOTH WITNESSED.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Feb 8, 2013 - Large orange shimmering object seen in Edmonds, WA.;2013-02-08 22:20:00;10 minutes;Feb 8, 2013 - Large orange shimmering object seen in Edmonds, WA I was driving home (around 10:20PM) and heading north when as I was approaching the driveway, I saw a large glowing yellow/orange shimmering object that resembled the look of the shell gas station logo.  I pulled halfway into our driveway but had to stop because the glowing object was so large that it startled me.  I thought maybe they had a big promotion using some sort of light to shoot their image straight up into the air, because it was not moving and it was stationary just over my neighbors house.  However, I could not see any lights underneath or around it and there were no letters or symbols. When I stepped out of the car, I realized that the object was not a sign, airplane or anything I have ever seen before. I reached for my cell phone to call my husband to come out of the house and see what I was looking at.  However, before he could run downstairs the object started moving slowly away (to the East) as if it noticed that I was watching it.  It began to become smaller and smaller as it slowly moved east from our area.  We both video taped it on our cell phones when it was leaving as it elevated into the sky.  As it gained altitude, it was noticable that the speed was increasing before it disappeared, even as it was moving away from us. We called the news station to report it, but they told us they were getting ready to go on air and hung up.  I managed to get a pretty good video of the color.  It is difficult to describe the experience because it is not something that I have seen before.  Looking at our cell phones, it lasted for no more than 10 minutes.  Did anyone else see this same sighting?   Description:   It looked like the shape of the Shell logo (a triangle with a circle on top) but it was more orange/red on the inside and yellow on the outside.  From my view point (my drive way to above my neighbors home), the object appeared very large, approximately the size of an actual shell gas station sign up in the air and in the shape of an upside down pear diamond. The object was not blinking, it was like watching a shimmering fire but there was no sound and it only shimmered around the outside.  There was more of a shimmer effect from the bottom portion of the object, but the object appeared as a perfect clean shape and not blurry.  So beautiful that I felt mezmerized and immediately had goose bumps. We have 3 videos (2 are taken at the same time from 2 cell phones) and 1 photo (camera was shakey).;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Super fast, bright UFO craft with amazing maneuvers witnessed by two people caught on camera.;2014-05-25 00:30:00;15-20 minutes;Super fast, bright UFO craft with amazing maneuvers witnessed by two people caught on camera. The UFO my Mother and I both witnessed together through binoculars which sit right inside the back door.  I also ran into the house and grabbed my 40D Canon camera.  I carry it with me pretty much everywhere.  I shot this image with a Canon 100-400mm lens on May. 25TH 2014 @ 12:30AM from Edmonds, WA.  We had gone outside because they had said on the news that there was possibly a meteor shower that night and we might be able to see a few of them.  When we stepped outside this is what we saw immediately.  This was no meteor... It approached from the west at a very high rate of speed, came to a dead stop with no hesitation or slowing down.  It then zipped miles to the left, stopped and zipped miles the right, came back to center-point to a dead stop again.  Then it started flipping and shooting all over the sky and this is the image I caught.  I had no idea it would of been this detailed until I had opened it up on my computer. Who knows if it was aliens or a black government project but it certainly was nothing we have ever seen before.  It was certainly an anti-gravity craft because nothing in the U.S. arsenal could pull this off in the sky.  Especially a human-being with all the G-force on the body.  It has a bright blue-white aura or haze around it, left a trail which is evident in the image.  We were in shock to say the least.  After it was moving all over the sky for a about 3-4 minutes, it came to a stop.  We watched it for about 15 minutes sit stationary until the clouds started covering it up then went inside and viewed the images.  We are wondering if anyone else in the area saw what we saw.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
