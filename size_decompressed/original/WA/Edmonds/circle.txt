I was sitting with my roommate talking about it and I kept noticing a bright light out the sliding glass window.  I finally interrupted her and started to notice it was not a star.  So i had a cheap telescope and said to my roommate, omg!! look at that star! its moving or whatever she grabbed the binoculars and was very startled at what we were seeing. it was like that movie of the third kind.  We switched glasses it just sat above the tree tops.  It was from Edmonds, Wa looking to Mlt. (mountlake terrace)if your from Wa.  I watched a white lite come out from it but it seemed to come from the ground to it.  Then it just stopped the light and sat there I saw a ring of orange windows so did she.  We were speechless  then as if it knew we had spotted it  I watched it just take off in a southwest direction toward Seattle.  It was so fast!!  maybe 4 seconds it was gone.  I have never told ANYONE OF THIS.  She was a very religious person I was whatever....The strangest thing is the second it was gone my mom's picture fell off the wall. Sincere Regards. please do not use my name Thank you Peter.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408

It went by quickly lasting maybe 3-4 seconds, it was quick, it was going by fast.  The body was about one tenth the size of the moon, and the tail was about 5 times as long as the body.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Bright red lights totalling about 40 moving over Edmonds, WA between 7:30pm and 8:00 pm on Saturday, 3/13/10.;2010-03-13 19:30:00;15 minutes;Bright red lights totalling about 40 moving over Edmonds, WA between 7:30pm and 8:00 pm on Saturday, 3/13/10. About 7:30 pm on Saturday, 3/13/10,  these bright red lights came moving over Edmonds, WA right over us.  They seemed to be in some kind of formation flying or moving at the exact same speed and height.  They would come 2 to 4 at a time in a group, then about 20 seconds later another group and so on - totalling about 30 to 40.  My husband and I and several of our neighbors witnessed this from the parking lot of the Mill Park Condominium Complex located at 7205 224th St. S.W. in Edmonds, WA.  We saw an aircraft fly by them, and it was flying quite a bit lower.  They came from about 7:30pm until around 8:00pm then stopped completely.   It was a clear night so they were easy to see.  My neighbor got a photo of this.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Moved Quickly and swiftly.;2018-08-12 18:18:00;1-2 minutes;Moved Quickly and swiftly. I was at a festival down by the waterfront with a friend in line to get food, I decided to take a few quick photos.  Did not see the object until later on my phone.  You can see a bird flying in the photo, a good reference point, and a man eating something, so you know the object moved quickly.  It went up and a bit North over Puget Sound.  Also, I took all the photos together, within seconds of one another.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
they looked like tiny moving stars  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-07 21:00:00;2 minutes;I was messing around with my telescope looking at the moon it was very bright that evening.  I looked straight up without my telescope for a second when over my head these tiny white dots maybe 12 in total moving about 1/2 mile apart from one another where flying across the sky from one end to the other  No sounds or blinking lights.  They were moving pretty fast .  It was obvious that something odd was going on.  I was thinking Wow whats that? and where are they going? I tried to make sense of my sighting but I became more confused as ive seen comets and shooting stars and this wasnt any of those The ufos were too far above the earth to be domestic planes as they looked like tiny moving stars and there is 2 airports near Edmonds WA Everett and Sea Tac not to mention Kenmoresand all the sea planes.We know what frikin planes and helicopters look like and how they fly and where they fly etc This wasnt any of those.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
