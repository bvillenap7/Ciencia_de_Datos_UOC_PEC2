Rainbow orb/cone.;2010-07-25 01:00:00;1 Hour;Rainbow orb/cone The object was first seen by naked eye and looked like a blinking star. The object did not move for 10-20 min. Then after it began to move it was seen with both binoculars and a telescope.  It had tumbling rainbow lights which seemed to circulate around the object.  The object did not move at a constant speed or direction, but did move slowly.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Meteor or UFO?  I lean towards UFO.;2014-06-25 21:04:00;30 seconds;Meteor or UFO? I lean towards UFO Sunset picture taken north of Brackets Landing.  Did not notice unidentified flying object until viewing pictures in zoom mode on the phone.  Viewed pictures taken at 21:03 and 21:05 and the object is not in those photos.  Only in the two taken at 21:04.  Zoomed in on what we thought was a star obviously not a star, color of a flame not white light of a star.  Then we noticed the two smoke circles behind it and a what appears to be a possible trail of the travel it took.  Attached two photos: original untouched.  And a copy of one I marked up with information.  UFO is in upper left hand corner of the picture.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
