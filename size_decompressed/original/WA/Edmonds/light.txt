A light appeared out of nowhere among the stars, and began to move unlike any aircraft that I've heard of, before retreating at extremely high speed and vanishing with a flash. The sighting occurred during the middle of summer,  and I was talking to my friend outside underneath a clear sky. I believe that it was the 15 of July, a day before my friend's birthday, although I'm not completely sure. My friend was talking to me on her stomach, so she didn't see anything, but I was on my back looking at the stars. I was randomly looking around, when all of sudden this fiercly bright light appeared at a high altitude (I assume), and it sat still for a second. Then, it began to move in a tight zig-zaggish pattern, with extremely straight lines, at about the speed that you see a plane going at, or a sattelite. It paused for a bit after each movement, and then it changed direction. I then noticed that it stopped and began to grow insanely bright. Not bigger, but just brighter. Then, it sped off extremely quickly... it was like a blur of light, and left with a flash, disappearing from sight at one point in the sky. It's movements, I noticed, were extremely clean, like a hovercraft does on water, except in very clean, straight lines. This all took place within my approximation of  about ten seconds.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Bright plasma looking light over the Olympic Mountains;2002-03-01 18:00:00;30 minutes;Bright plasma looking light over the Olympic Mountains My wife and I were watching a beautiful northwest sunset when she noticed a very odd contrail streaking very quickly from west to east. She pointed out the contrail to me, she called it a 'pearl necklace' trail.  As we watched, we suddenly noticed a very bright light to the far southwest of our location, high above the Olympic mountains. (We were on the third floor of our home which has a wide, open view of the Olympics and Puget Sound)   The daylight was still very bright as the sun had just slipped behind the mountain range.  We watched the light for several minutes as the aircraft we were watching passed out of sight.  The light didn't move.  We found it odd that it was so bright.  My wife grabbed a pair of binoculars that we always keep nearby for watching eagles around our house.  We observed the light for about ten more minutes throught the binoculars.  The light was very bright and about 4 times the size of Venus.  I decided to look at the object through the 675 power telescope we also keep handy.  Through the telescope, the object appeared very large and high above the mountains.  It was a bright red glow that had yellow and orange colors running through it almost as if it were liquid.  Surrounding the object was a ring of bright blue and green light that also appeared liquid as it changed colors. The object suddenly began to move slowly to the west southwest.  It moved about equal to one inch per minute at arm's length.  The object them made a course change to the due south and sped up.  It then slowed once again and turned toward the west where it slipped out of sight behind the mountains.  From the perspective we had, the object had to be very far away and very large and metallic.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Two orange sun dogs near horizon seen from Edmonds looking west;2003-06-29 21:00:00;30 minutes;Two orange sun dogs near horizon seen from Edmonds looking west On Saturday June 29, 9 PM a group of us saw 2 orange lights near the horizon against a sun that had either just set or had gone behind clouds. I'm certain that they were sun dogs, but thought it would be interesting to file this report as the other people I was with were completely stumped and were guessing stars, planets, planes, ufos. Here is what the sun dogs looked like: They were about a quarter inch in length, slightly cylindrical and vertical. They were kind of like orange paint daubs on a canvas and they stood out well from the orange sky behind them. Anyway, if anyone else reports the same thing, it might be interesting to compare the reports. ((NUFORC Note:  We know this witness, and know her to be an exceptionally cautious observer, with a great deal of technical training and experience.  PD));47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Bright object in the sky flashes on and off;2003-09-02 04:45:00;approx. 10 min.;Bright object in the sky flashes on and off The incident occurred on September 2nd at approximately 4:45 a.m. I had been asleep, but was awakened by what sounded like an airplane.  The area I live in is very quiet, so it was unusual to hear an airplane, especially one loud enough to wake me up.  I went to the window to look outside (my bedroom faces west) and I saw a bright light in the sky.  It seemed too large to be a star and it wasn't moving like an airplane.  Instead, it stayed stationary.  As I watched it, I noticed that the light would be bright one moment, then it would be gone, then it would be bright again and then it would be gone.  I watched for about 10 minutes with the light pulsing on and off until it finally disappeared. The time between the light appearing and disappearing was probably around 5 or 10 seconds.  Since that morning, I have looked in the sky each night to determine if it was a plane or a helicopter that I saw.  The planes I've watched since then don't stay stationary that long and they fly across the sky along a particular route.  I don't know how long helicopters can remain stationary, but the object I saw seemed too high in the sky to be a helicopter.  I have also checked to see if there are other lights in the same area that I may have misinterpreted for this object, but all of the lights that I have seen (from houses and buildings)are much lower in the sky than the object I saw. I also thought that clouds could have intermittently covered the object and made it appear that the object was flashing on and off, but I believe the skies were clear that morning.  Because I haven't seen anything in the sky like this before, I thought I would report this to you.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Incredibly Fast moving Bright White Light Seen in Edmonds, Washington climbed straight up into space....;2007-09-08 22:30:00;5 seconds;Incredibly Fast moving Bright White Light Seen in Edmonds, Washington climbed straight up into space.... On the evening of September 8th 2007 at approximately  10:30PM I was in my backyard  - there were no lights on, it was very dark.  The sky was totally clear – all you could see were the stars.  I was putting my head back in disgust of how fast the day had gone by in other words, in other words..  I wasn’t looking for UFO’s… in fact, I never look for weird things in the sky. Within seconds of looking up at the dark sky I saw a bright white light that seemed could have been as high as 10,000 feet in the air, suddenly became smaller and smaller as it seemed to climb in elevation and move in a northwesterly direction at a startling rate of speed. I jumped out of my lawn chair and immediately pointed to it trying to get my wife’s attention.  She was able to see it climb and disappear in probably less than 5 seconds.  Unfortunately she missed out on seeing just how low to the earth it was and how incredibly bright it was before it started to take off.  She agreed that it did appear to be moving upward and very fast. My wife who used to be a flight attendent, obviously has been around a lot of airports and has seen a lot of thing- but she said this was certainly something to report.  It was truly amazing to see something like this.  I have seen satellites, shooting stars and have even watched the space shuttle land.  This was something special to see and for me – unexplainable.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
In sequence two multi-colored rotating lights move North and East over South Whidby Island, approximately 5 minutes each,;2008-11-08 17:47:00;13 minutes;In sequence two multi-colored rotating lights move North and East over South Whidby Island, approximately 5 minutes each, UFOs over South Whidbey Island 11/08/2008 5:47 PM Viewed through binoculars – 7X35 wide angle. 4 witnessed the first portion of event – observer and family with and without binoculars. Whitness had stepped out to put dogs out and was struck by appearance of rotating multicolored light. Object description - multi-colored light - white, green, and red, alternating – seemingly rotating over by Double Bluff area of Whidbey Island, WA. The object was probably a few thousand feet altitude. The light had shape, was not point source and the colors were not fixed position – either alternating position or rotating and encompassing a large portion of the object – the rest of the object maintaining a bright white light. From my house just across the Puget Sound in North Edmonds and without visual obstruction the light looked larger than an aircraft. The light moved East and North passing over a tower with a red beacon on the hill, traveling level and seemingly very slowly. After it was several miles North and East of the tower it turned East out over the Puget Sound and headed North towards Everett, seeming to fly over the middle of the sound. There was no noise detected and no other aircraft in the air at that time. The duration was between 5 and 8 minutes. As it moved far enough to be out of view to the North, another similar light appeared in the same location, maybe slightly to the East of the original position of the first object at approximately 5:53 PM. The second moved very slowly over the tower and towards the East, but before it got to the Puget Sound, it began gaining altitude. It picked up speed as it started upward, but the disappearance took several minutes. As the size decreased due to the distance, you could still detect the rotational aspect of the lighting. When it became a point of changing color, it was noted that there was at least one other object up near the one under observation, a little to the east and lower. It also displayed the same alternating color with predominant white light around it. These lights became discernable after a minute or two. The duration of the second sighting was approximately 5 minutes.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Likely explanation for 12/25/10 Edmonds WA sighting;2010-12-25 19:40:00;20 mins;Likely explanation for 12/25/10 Edmonds WA sighting This is in response to the report at -   http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79373.html   I witnessed at least 20 chinese lanterns being set aloft between 7:30 and 7:45 from the side of a hill in Woodway (we were at the Point Edwards condo development less than a 1/4 mile away.  They would rise slowly until they cleared the trees and would then pick up speed as they were swept up by the wind.  They traveled NW until they went out minutes later. If I hadn't seen them launched, I would have thought they were UFOs as well (and thus wondered if anyone would report them here).  In flight, it was difficult to discern their size and distance.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Approximately 24 Orange Lights Over Puget Sound.;2013-06-29 22:10:00;~10 minutes;Approximately 24 Orange Lights Over Puget Sound 06/29/2013  Approximately 10:10pm to 10:20pm Edmonds, WA, looking West over Puget Sound   While walking our dog, my wife noticed some strange orange lights over Puget Sound.   At first glance I thought they were helicopters, but they didn’t look quite right and there were a lot of them, but not flying in any true formation.  She mentioned they looked like a murder of crows going to roost.   As we watch them move from the North to South, they started to disappear.  The night was clear and we could see some early stars where they were disappearing.  They just kept coming on a relative same direction, but other than that they didn’t appear to be following any type of formation.  Some seemed to be coming more in an South East direction toward us, then would fade away.  There were at least a couple dozen of them.  They would seem to end, and then a few more would come from the same general direction.  All heading in a Southern direction.   Toward the end, one looked like it was almost coming toward us more than the others.  When I thought that I should surely hear some sound from it by now, it just faded away.   I have a video form my cell phone, but I’m not sure how it turned out.  I haven’t look at it yet.  We continued to walk out dog (who also seemed a little nervous, I’m not sure if she picked up my wife’s attitude about the lights or if she sensed something, but she wanted us to pick her up).  We kept looking back to the West and kept seeing a few more.  The last one faded out somewhat earlier than the others, but none of them did at the same area, but most did later in their journey. We finally got home, and almost exactly an hour later (11:10pm) we saw one more while we were in the house.  We couldn’t help but keep looking. If you have any other reports I would love to know.  If someone knows what it is, I’d like to know that as well.   I’ve live here my whole life, and I’ve never seen anything like this.  Thank you.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
At 11 pm on August 22, 2014 my friend and I saw a light performing jumps, fading then reappearing left and right of trajectory.;2014-08-22 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;At 11 pm on August 22, 2014, my friend and I saw a light performing jumps, fading then reappearing left and right of trajectory. My friend and I were reclining on the deck at my house on a bluff above Puget Sound 4 miles north of downtown Edmonds, Washington.  We were watching the stars and pointing things out to each other.   At close to 11:00 PM, I noted what I thought was a satellite traversing the sky from south to north, so I got my friend on it.  It began fading and jumping to the left and back to the right again.  It would fade then reappear to the left or right – bright as it flashed back on.  Knowing that eyes can make far objects appear to move, we were crosschecking our observations with each other.  The path also changed while it was jumping – it took a long hook as it went from south – north to east - west.  We were both taken back by what we saw.  This was a very high altitude event – it certainly could be compared to a satellite in terms of brightness and altitude.   My friend is an engineer and a pilot – he was adamant about me not mentioning his name.  I have never seen one before t! hat had that jerky zig - zag motion. The sighting was probably 1-2 minutes long.  The speed of the object was comparable to a satellite.  It traversed about a 30 degree arc.   When first sighted it was about 45 degrees up from horizontal.  After about 20 seconds of these left to right to left jumping motions it simply faded out.   At that point it was straight out in front of us – still at about 45 degrees from horizontal.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Stationary bright light at approximately 2000 feet which split into two lights and disappeared.;2020-11-15 16:46:00;5 minutes;Stationary bright light at approximately 2000 feet which split into two lights and disappeared. I observed a very bright light almost directly above my house.  It was stationary for approximately three to four minutes at an estimated altitude of two thousand feet.  It was sporadically partially obscured by clouds which were moving rapidly from south to north.  There was no sound.  After three or four minutes the light dimmed and split into two lights aligned north and south which slowly moved apart for a few seconds until they were approximately a thumbnail apart at which point they disappeared. I am a retired engineer and scientist in the field of measurement science.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Bight ball over apartments landed in wooded area;2021-01-17 01:34:00;4 minutes;Bight ball over apartments landed in wooded area A bright ball of light suddenly appeared around 80 or 90 feet in the air above our apartment complex it was stationary. It was big and bright enough to light up our apartment room a block away. It would flash it's light on and off multiple times. Being super bright then 100% pitch dark and it was close enough to is that when it would turn off we should have been able to see a craft or outline of what it was but we were not able to see any thing. It then turned it back on after a few flashes and slowly descended into a wooded area right below where it was hoovering. We waited an hour to see if it would return or leave but saw nothing else.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
