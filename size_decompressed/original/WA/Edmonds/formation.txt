Multiple circular UFO sighting in the sky above Edmonds, WA witnessed by police officer and police explorers.;1996-06-15 02:30:00;10-15 min;Multiple circular UFO sighting in the sky above Edmonds, WA witnessed by police officer and police explorers. Myself (18 yrs old), several teens, and one police officer witnessed the following event at approx 2:30 am while doing overnight security for the Edmonds Art Festival in the summer of 1996.  I recall everyone gathered above the top of the Edmonds Library for a quick break and re-assignment when one of us spotted 3 flashing lights in the sky above Puget Sound.  All of us stopped talking and were in shock to notice these circular white and red lights make triangle formations in the sky.  They appeared to be playing and chased each other at rapid and then slow speeds to re-group.  At one point, they disappeared into the night sky and then came back to spin/zip around.  Eventually, a 4th one came down and then they disappeared by fading so high into the sky we could no longer see them after 15min or so.  Some of the teens cried and went home.  The police officer who was there literally got teary-eyed from fear and asked that we not ever speak of what we witnesse! d that night because he promised to deny it, and advised people to leave.  I was an adult and we were all police explorers doing a security detail for the community artists and vendors.  Some of us still speak of that night, but we know people who weren't there think we're nuts and all made it up... I wish I could say it was make believe, but it wasn't.

Mass of lights moving simultaneously from west to east.;1997-11-14 21:05:00;1.5 minutes;Summary : Mass of lights moving simultaneously from west to east. I was driving west on 196th St SW,in Edmonds, when I noticed a mass of bright lights in the sky to my north.  I could not identify what they were.  At first I thought they were a squadron of helicoptors flying in formation with their lights on.  I immediately pulled over and got out of my truck.  I looked up and saw the mass, moving very slowly to the east.  It looked to be about 3,000 feet off of the ground.  There was no engine noise. It moved at a steady pace until it got to the tree tops to my right(east) and then dissappeared.  I have seen many meteor showers and this was not like anything I have seen in 15 years of living in the desert southwest.  The lights did not arc.  They all moved in unison and steady.  They did not change course.  Today, the official explanation from the Pentagon, is that it was a Russian rocket which crashed into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington.  Why was it heading towards eastern Washington?  If it was space junk, it would have had to be enormous.  It covered about 25% of the visible sky. Which makes me think it was lower.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Observed 3 lights in formation in night sky with 2 fading out and one accelerating out of sight.;2008-09-04 23:58:00;90 Sec;Observed 3 lights in formation in night sky with 2 fading out and one accelerating out of sight. There were three objects, points of light, similar to a star or satellite. The lights were in a elongated trianglar formation with one leading the group. They came out of the northwest and traveled southeast. Initial rate of speed was unknown but they slowed when passing overhead. Second witness was called outside to observe. The two points of light at the rear of the formation slowly faded out. The remaining light accelerated out of sight in a second.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
2 objects flying South at high speed over the Seattle area;2010-09-29 20:45:00;5 minutes;2 objects flying South at high speed over the Seattle area Outside on Wednesday evening, September 29th at about 8:45pm.  I was facing South, looking up at a clear sky when a object with 3 lights flew overhead at high velocity. The object was gone from sight north to south in about 5 seconds. Unable to determine size or height. The 3 light were angled high left or East to low right or West.  A second object, bigger with 10 or so faint lights, followed the same route at a slow pace a few minutes later. The light pattern was front, left side and back of the object from my view, and the object moved the above me North to South in about 8 seconds.  No sound was heard.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Reddish/Orange objects over Puget Sound turned into triangle then vanished.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-25 19:00:00;2:00;Reddish/Orange objects over Puget Sound turned into triangle then vanished Around 7:00PM yesterday my family and I were heading down to visit my aunt in Edmonds. We were almost to the intersection of 9th Ave. South and Walnut St., traveling down Walnut St. heading West.  That's when I first noticed 5 reddish/orange glowing objects in the sky out over the Puget Sound.  We immediately pulled to the side of the road just before the intersection.  We sat and watched the objects for around 2 minutes.  Upon pulling to the side of the road two of the objects sorta just blinked out, then one reappeared before vanishing, leaving just three objects which now formed a massive triangle shape.  The triangle then just slowly rotated before each reddish/orange object vanished.  Not sure what, or who that thing was, but it was not a plane, or group of planes, drones or Chinese lanterns. My girlfriend and I have seen sightings like this online and never thought we would ever witness something like it ourselves.  Naturally we both opted to leave our phones at home and my mom's phone has a potato camera so we didn't get any photos or video.  But I'm glad I could just be in the moment to experience it.  Truly mind blowing.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
5:40 in the morning. It was partly cloudy. I looked up and saw a light moving slowly from W to E. ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-31 05:40:00;6-7 minutes;I was outside at 5:40 in the morning. It was partly cloudy. I looked up and saw a light moving slowly from West to East. I then saw more lights behind it coming. I ran inside to get my wife. She came out and saw the same thing. They then disappeared behind the clouds.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
The formation looked like a stream of 50 to 100 stars silently moving north in a nearly perfect line. ((Starlink satellites));2020-10-15 06:25:00;2 minutes;The formation looked like a stream of 50 to 100 stars silently moving north in a nearly perfect line We watched a string of objects that looked like stars about the brightness of Orionâ€™s belt. They were moving north over Puget sound.  They seem to be in pairs or groups of three but pretty much all in a straight line. They moved quickly and silently across the sky. We first saw them somewhere in the middle of the line that disappeared to our right off to the north.  There was one That appeared out of the eastern sky and turned north to join the procession.  We watched them traveling north until they disappeared out of sight. We would love to know if anybody else has seen this or knows what we saw.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
4 Lighted pale orange shapes seen twice in cone formation and rectangular formation 2 different nights;2021-03-01 22:05:00;Unknown;4 Lighted pale orange shapes seen twice in cone formation and rectangular formation 2 different nights Last night, March 1st 2021, at 10:05 pm, I saw 4 lights in the southwest sky in Edmonds.  They had a slightly pale orange tint to them.  There were 3 evenly spaced-horizontal in the sky.  The 4th one was directly below the middle one about 15 degrees south.   As such       *      *      *  *                                                          They were moving up and down in unison. I watched for 5 minutes.  I looked again at 11:30pm, they were gone.  On Wednesday night February 24th, 2021, (I believe it was that night or the following night), about 11:00 pm, in the same spot in the southwest sky, I saw the 4 lighted objects.  They were in a rectangular shape with the lower far right one dropping downward moving faster than the others were moving.  They were closer to earth than the ones on March 1st.  Their color was a bit more orange/red. As such   *    * *        *;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
