Orange glow center At about 22:15 at night, on Saturday, September 27, 2014, my daughter looked up in the sky while she was getting into our car.  Not high enough to be an airplane, but almost like at the height a model airplane would fly.  7 or 8 rounded rectangular shaped objects, with an orange glowing light at their center, were flying in a single line but staggered, formation.   The horizontal flight path was going north to south, from the very southernmost and easternmost part of Edmonds southbound—southbound along Shoreline, just west of Interstate 5—through Shoreline. They were lit up with a big orange glow in the center.   We were thinking that maybe they were a cluster of drones or lanterns.  However, have never seen either in person so really unable to compare to anything. They didn’t make any distinguishing types of noises—like an airplane or helicopter… or any loud noise for that matter.  The noise I did hear, was a very soft, hum/whistle that maybe a sophisticated, high tech, model airplane--engineered specifically for low noise.  We lost sight of them as they headed down past Shoreline.  By the time we called out a houseguest and my son to come witness these items, only two were visible for them to see as they were above Shoreline (central) along and above the I-5 corridor.  This is most likely what I saw--at night--but the shape of it is how it is depicted in this photo:http://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/AFAEED3C-749A-42C1-8E796C8B74E8C45B_article.jpg?8BC4B;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408

I walked outside to take my dog out and looked up at the sky to see what looked like two rows of yellow lights moving above me. They were flying at a fast but constant pace. As I looked in the direction that it was going, I saw one light ahead which made me realize it appeared to be a giant craft above me instead of just the rectangular lights. Being 5 am it was still not light out but it was clear enough to see it was not a plane and there was absolutely no noise coming from the craft. Lots of planes fly above this apartment complex and I have never witnessed anything like this before. We have a lot of tall evergreens here and as I tried to follow it, it disappeared behind some of the trees.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
