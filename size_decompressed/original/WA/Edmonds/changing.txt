Object was orange and appeared to glowing.  I went to my truck to get my binoculars.   My wife and daughter were present, and observed the object also. The object was diamond shaped and was rotating.  When the object rotated, it appeared to change shape, looking thinner, with a white line running vertically done the center.   We watched the object until a cloud blocked the view.   The object was stationary in the sky.;47.8213887323943;-122.346316901408
Silent curved shape changing object gliding through the sky;2016-11-30 23:45:00;5-7 seconds;Silent curved shape changing object gliding through the sky I was outside letting my dog out before heading to bed like I do every night when I noticed this curved ufo gliding through the sky.  While gazing at the stars I noticed what I thought at first was a satellite in my peripheral vision.  It caught my attention, and I immediately looked towards it.   I then realized this wasn't a satellite.  It seemed to be lower in the sky then a satellite, as it was a lot brighter.  It had six lights making a curved shaped and glided silently through the sky from the North West, heading South East.   I watched the object for 5-7 seconds (felt like forever) before the six lights that made up the curve changed into one object and disappeared.   It was not a plane, or like anything I have ever seen.
