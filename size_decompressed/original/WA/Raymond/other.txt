24 lights from one spot in the sky, heading W S and E.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 22:40:00;15-20 minutes;24 lights from one spot in the sky, heading W S and E At 1040 pm PDT I saw a light that looked like a star (a background star, not bright like Venus) moving from west to east â€“ as I continued to watch, another light came from the same spot in the sky and started to glide east as well.  Over the course of about 15 minutes, I saw over two dozen (I stopped counting at 16) of what looked like a star, not a bright star, just a background star, coming from the same spot in the western sky and moving in different directions. The lights were not evenly spaced when they arrived, sometimes one would appear soon after the one before. They each had their own course and eventually had spread out in a spoke-like pattern, going north, east and south. They were all going the same speed, fairly slow. The yellowish light did not change or dim, there was no blinking or colored lights. They appeared to be within our atmosphere, like a high plane.  I just happened to be looking in the right place.  Anyone glancing at the sky would! think it was a star, it moved slowly and it took me a minute to confirm that these particular stars were actually moving. They each stayed in a linear direction, no turns or movement other than gliding in a line like spokes. It was like a clown-car, they just continued to emerge from the same spot in the sky. Eventually, they stopped emerging.;46.6743;-123.6947
