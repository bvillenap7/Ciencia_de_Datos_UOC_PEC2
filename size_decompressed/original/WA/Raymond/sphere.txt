It was an orange ball, on the horizon, moving from the north east roughly, to the south west. It looked like it could be a plane, but it was large and bright, so i watched it.  Obviously moving fast, but no faster than a jet.  There were no quick jerky movements like I see in web video's or hear in witness accounts. About a minute into watching it while i walked my dog, it had come about the distance a large plane would have, and started almost swooning (the objects-) left, then straight, then right.  Slow and closer to conspicuous, or maybe looking for something.  All animals that can make the same movement looking for something.  Then the object seemed to stop, but for a very short amount of time, a second or less, went forward again and changed overall direction.  I thought it was east, until it was obvious it was going up, in no particular hurry.  It grew smaller heading very obviously upward, until i could no longer see it. I'm trying to be detailed, in case you are genuine people trying to discover what i feel to be inevitable, if not already a part of our history.  This is what should be on everyones minds, not elections for idiots or division in our race.  This is the advancement or fall of humanity, along side our own actions. Its 6/28/20.  Fireworks were being set, though to me it had nothing to do with what i saw, very obviously.  Its somewhat cloudy, high winds.  Winds probably very high at cloud level, they were moving relatively fast, but never went across the object.  I had woken up from a nap about a hour before, and was completely coherent, not under any influence aside from caffeine.  I only put one time in the upper box, but it was between 10:15 pm and 10:20 pm. I hope this helps. Good luck.;46.6743;-123.6947
