I walked outside, I became enveloped in a tube of light and static electricity.   70' off the ground all the needles & fir cones of the fir tree I stood under fell to the ground. I lost time. I moved out of the cabin to Eatonville. Last week I believe they found me. Am missing time, one full day. Since the first experience I now have visions of coming events. Revelations of the Bible.
