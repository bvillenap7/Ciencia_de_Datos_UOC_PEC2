From outerspace to almost landing near the Southwest area of Mt Rainer  on 8/2003;2003-08-15 03:00:00;10 minutes;From outerspace to almost landing near the Southwest area of Mt Rainer  on 8/2003 Me and another person were outside talking around 3:00AM around mid August 2003, someone had been coming onto our property, trespassing at night and we were out there waiting, to see who it was, or catch them, the property is located just Southwest of mount Rainer by a few miles at it's base, we both observed what looked like a falling star, it moved across the night sky pretty fast, than without changing speed it made a 90 degree change in direction and came strait dowm to what looked like about a 1000 feet next to the mountain, it glowed brightly to this point, than it stoped in mid air and came down slowly over near longmire area, as it came down the rest of the way to the ground the brightness turned to a amber glow and the more detail we could see, it was an oval shape and i could make out what looked like I beams with round holes on the interior of the craft, it also was rotating at a vary slow pace around I figure we were about a mile to two away from it's decent point, but because of the size of the craft by the time it was close to the ground, I guess it may have been around 30 to 40 feet in diameter, it looked like it had come down right over a glacier and river in that southeast area of the mountain, it went behind trees as it got even lower and I had lost sight of it, I waited for a while, but i never seen it again. their was no noise at all. My background is almost 18 years at the Boeing company, one projects that I worked on was the B-2 bomber for 6 years as an engineer, which was a black project, this was not one of ours or for that fact not one of anyone elses as well, I had never seen any plane move like this, after that encounter, well, let's just say, I am a believer, the person that was with me and who also seen this object was in the military for 6 years, we were both stuned by what we saw that night. i could draw this object I remember it so well.
