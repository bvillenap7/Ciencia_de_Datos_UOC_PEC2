Shortly before the New Year to a few minutes after, I was preparing some fireworks outside to welcome in the New Year.  I had returned inside to get something.  When I went back out, I glanced to the northwest and saw two orange-red colored lights.  They were moving inline, with one light following behind the other, and heading almost directly over our small town. The weather was cold and foggy, but the fog had lifted to a low cloud ceiling.  The lights were traveling in a west to east direction, and were beneath the clouds.  They were moving steadily and I noticed were completely silent, no sound at all.  These were clearly not aircraft lights, and were larger than aircraft lights would appear at that distance. When the lights were almost directly overhead, the lead light appeared to turn and go straight up until it disappeared into the clouds.  The second light followed just past where the first light went upward into the clouds.  It seemed to stop, and backtrack slightly, before it too went straight up into the clouds. I checked the weather recorded at the Pullman/Moscow Airport  15 miles to the south, and they were recording an 1800 ft cloud ceiling.  Given similar conditions, I would estimate these lights when I first saw them were traveling around 1500 to 1800 ft above my location. I do not know what these were, but I am almost certain these were not airplanes, helicopters, fireworks or meteors. Due to them flying almost directly over our small town and their low altitude, I had the feeling of possible observation?;46.9092;-117.0858
