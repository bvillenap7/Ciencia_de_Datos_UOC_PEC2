UFO sightings in the Palouse region of Eastern Washington.;1975-06-01 01:00:00;3 minutes;UFO sightings in the Palouse region of Eastern Washington. Late at night at an unknown date, probably in the late 70’s, my mother glanced out of an eastward facing window in our Palouse area family farm house.  It was harvest time and she saw bright lights near the top of a hill to the east southeast.  At first she thought that it may have been a combine working at night but this was our property and our machines were all parked for the night.  As she looked closer she was able to see what she described as a “wing shape” silhouetted against the night sky with several white lights visible.  She awoke my father who also observed the phenomenon as the object drifted slowly away to the east southeast and out of sight behind the hill.  At another late night date my mother was awakened by our dogs barking frantically in the back of our home which faced toward the north.  She went out to see what was the problem and observed a red glowing globular object about the size of an automobile floating from east to west about 50 yards from where she stood behind the house.  Interestingly, when in a conversation with a couple that they had known for many years, my parents mentioned their experiences.  These people related a similar experience one night on a county road nearby where a similar red globe was hovering very low, nearly touching the ground, in the middle of the roadway.  As they approached, slowed and stopped their vehicle the red glowing object shot vertically up and out of sight at great speed.  These people were so frightened by the experience they had never mentioned it to anyone until they heard my parents story.  As far as I know these sightings occurred during the same general time frame.;46.9092;-117.0858
