Sound-ONLY of large aircraft passing close overhead.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is commercial pilot.  PD));2014-05-29 20:14:00;60 seconds;Sound-ONLY of large aircraft passing close overhead Clear blue sky with slightest white haze just after sunset, quiet environment.  I was outside, began hearing a mechanical-engine sound that got louder and louder.  Couldn't identify at first, I presumed a semi-truck or train a few blocks away (but NO 'exhaust note'). But it got louder and closer, I realized it was passing overhead.   I stood in the middle of the street, hat off, looking up, turning around and around expecting to see this LARGE aircraft that my ears suggested should be just a few thousand feet up.  (I am a Commercial Pilot, have heard many large aircraft, but could NOT compare this engine-mechanical sound to this imagined 747/B-52 size massive aircraft I could NOT see.)  Its path overhead seemed to be NNW (toward Fairchild AFB from here) and I imagined it was decelerating but could be Doppler playing slight sound-tricks. Entire event lasted roughly 60 seconds as the sound faded to nothing to my NorthNorthWest, with never the slightest visual hint. Path crossed over my location Lat 46.91 & Long 117.07 heading to the NNW. Sound peaked in the 80-90db range. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar report from Garfield, WA, for the same time and date.
