Blue sphere moving slowly at low altitude, stopping twice to hover over road and then lake, vanishing with incredible speed;1993-06-15 04:00:00;1 minute;Blue sphere moving slowly at low altitude, stopping twice to hover over road and then lake, vanishing with incredible speed 5-31-10  I have not told anyone else about this event, with the exception of my children.  I was never completely sure about what it was that I actually saw, but I know what I saw was real.  I did not want to sound like a nut case, or someone that was trying to get attention through sensational happenings.  However, after years of watching programs about UFO sightings and reading testimonials of others that have described over and over almost exactly, in most cases what I witnessed, I have finally decided for sure that I saw a UFO that did not seem to be anything that could be designed and operated by people from Earth. My wife and I were driving home after checking on our employees that worked late shifts.  We were heading North on I-405 through Kirkland WA.  My wife was sleeping.  It was about 4:30 am when I saw a bright fluorescent sphere moving very slow from east to west.  It had just cleared over the top of a hill to my right and lowered to a few hundred ft. above the road.  Then it stopped directly above the road and hovered there for a few seconds.   I yelled at my wife to wake up and to take a look at what was right in front of us.  The sphere started to slowly move west across the road.  It kept an altitude relative to the slope of the hillside covered with houses, as this area is heavily populated.  It moved slowly out over Lake Washington.  When it was a few hundred feet out over the lake, it again stopped and hovered for a few seconds.   At arms distance the size of the object was relative to the size of a basketball.  The color was about the same as the blue of propane or natural gas when burning.  It made absolutely no sound.   At this time my wife was witnessing the event as well as I was.  Then suddenly the sphere slightly expanded and then rapidly shrank into a pin sized dot that lasted for a second or two, as it vanished with incredible speed to the North, almost as if it just disappeared.   We were both speechless for a few seconds and then we verified with each other that we both saw what we saw and could not put any logical explanation forth to name this as a natural earthly happening. I no longer feel like I need to suppress my feeling about what we saw that early morning.  I know I have seen something like all of the others that have reported seeing something similar.  Unless there is a great secret, being well hidden from the masses, what we have witnessed is not from this planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

A circular ball of extremely bright white and red light was sighted moving from southeast to northwest at a rapid rate of speed.  Objec;2002-01-21 23:35:00;5 seconds;A circular ball of extremely bright white and red light was sighted moving from southeast to northwest at a rapid rate of speed.  Object was just above tree top level and seemed to undulate (kind of like jello) with the white and then the red light dominating in color.  The object was in a downward trajectory as though it would enter Lake Washington if it continued it's downward movement.  There was no sound that I could discern from the object even though I was inside.  We can usually hear an aircraft even from indoors here in our area. The light was far brighter than any aircraft lights or helicopter lights, and was much larger. It also did not follow the usual aircraft flight patterns that are the norm for this area. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found her to be quite convincing in her description of the event.  PD));47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
Round object travelling west above Kirkland, WA;2003-08-17 16:15:00;3 minutes;Round object travelling west above Kirkland, WA I was in my backyard with a friend. I live on Rose Hill in Kirkland, with a clear view of the south. The sky was blue and clear, light wind, no clouds in that direction. She was ready to do a Reiki treatment for me. Right when I laid on the table, facing south, I looked up and saw an object moving slowly from W to E. Then it stopped. I asked my friend what this was. She saw the same thing. We looked at it for approx 3 minutes. In that time, it didn't move. No markings, no sound. We don't think it was an airplane or copter, and it didn't behave the way a balloon behaves. It appeared white and almost perfectly round. The sky was clear and there was no glare. It was close enough that we could watch it, knew it was something solid, but finally had to continue our session and took our eyes off it. We have no idea what it was, but have never seen anything like it before.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
Round, very bright object with small bright object nearby moved in a square area  for 3 minutes in a.m. hours.;2007-07-03 03:30:00;3 min.;Round, very bright object with small bright object nearby moved in a square area  for 3 minutes in a.m. hours. Main object was a round orb and very bright. Seen near downtown Seattle from the east across Lake Washington approx 4 miles away? Object moved horizontally then vertically within a box/square of space for about 3 minutes. Main object moved through different colors from white, yellow then red/blue - very bright. As the sighting continued, the main object was “buzzed” by very small, round, white light that gave off quick light bursts near the object approx. 5 times, before it ceased. Then, the main object gave off bright light burst and moved vertical slightly before it disappeared completely. GONE!  As background: The night sky was relatively clear with no noticeable wind and just a few high clouds. I used the tree line to measure the object’s unconventional movement. At the same time, I observed several airplanes making their approach/departures near SeaTac airport. I clearly observed aircraft and stars before and after the “EVENT”.  The above described round orb and little light are like nothing else I’ve witnessed in night sky, not even remotely. I've been thinking about this all day, and it's still with me very strongly. I was just standing on my deck looking at the view and it really spooked me to see something so strange and have it stay with me so vividly. I decided to search online to see if anyone else saw anything unusual in the area to no avail, but I feel obligated to report this. I am an educated individual and for sure skeptical of UFOs. But, this was definitely beyond what I can explain.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
bright white circle moving very fast north to south;2010-07-19 22:30:00;4 seconds;bright white circle moving very fast north to south At 10:30 pm approximately, on July 19th in Kirkland, Washington, my wife and I were out on the front porch of our house.  I stepped out onto the lawn and looked up towards the big dipper when a bright white light looking exactly like the brightest star in the sky, was moving in a north to south direction following the handle of the big dipper at a speed like I’ve never seen.  It covered the whole sky in maybe 4 seconds.  No tail or burn like a meteor but just a bright white orb.  It appeared to be very high. It didn’t flicker or change colors but was moving extremely fast. It looked like a star.  It was definitely not a satellite.  It was moving at least 20 times as fast as one.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273

Small orange/yellow light moving slowly for 30 secs, but no satellites shown to be in the area at time.;2014-07-04 22:50:00;30 seconds;Small orange/yellow light moving slowly for 30 secs, but no satellites shown to be in the area at time. Looking directly east at about 35 degrees high and fairly far away (probably over the Cascade mountains) my wife and I saw a small orange/yellow slow moving light.    We knew it wasn't an airplane because there were no flashing lights, but there was a bit of a twinkle to it (probably because of the atmosphere).   It moved South very slowly for about 30 seconds and then slowly went out.   We thought it was the ISS or a satellite, but I just went on all of the websites to see what is in our area and I don't see anything showing up on any of the Satellite tracking websites.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
4 rotating orange lights in the Kingsgate area above the Safeway.;2020-09-12 21:00:00;~30 minutes;4 rotating orange lights in the Kingsgate area above the Safeway. Around 9pm the power went out in the Kingsgate area.  Four lights were spotted rotating above the local Safeway and surrounding streets.  They were rotating fast but staying relatively in the same spots.  Also described as orange lights. About thirty minutes later they disappeared.  The second they disappeared the power was restored.  Later a station of police from Woodinville and Kirkland came to guard the street where it happened.  They wouldn't let anyone go past the street, putting out search lights and flare signals so people couldn't drive past Safeway.  The police also would not let people walk past to go home.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
