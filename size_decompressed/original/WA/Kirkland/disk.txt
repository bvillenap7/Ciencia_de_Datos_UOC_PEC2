Bright light traveling north to southwest and another bright light crossed it's path going from south at almost noon.;2000-08-03 11:15:00;10 minutes;Bright light traveling north to southwest and another bright light crossed it's path going from south at almost noon. The Blue Angels were practicing over Lake Washington, and I heard their roar, so I stepped out onto my south-facing deck to see if I could catch a glimpse of them, and I looked up into the sunny sky and saw a bright light moving slowly from the north to the south.  I got my binoculars, and saw a silver disk-shaped object with a very bright light on one side.  As I followed this object, another very bright light crossed it's path going from south to north.  These were definitely not jets.  An airliner did pass overhead going from northwest to southeast during that time.  I heard a high-pitched whirring sound during this sighting.  I've never witnessed any other event like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies herself as a business owner.

We saw a disk slowly rotating from end to end across the skyline.;2007-04-22 19:15:00;3 minutes;We saw a disk slowly rotating from end to end across the skyline. I was outside on a nice Sunday evening working in the yard.  There were some neighbor kids playing ball in the street.  I overheard them say, What is that? I looked at them they were looking in the sky.  I saw what started out as a dark circle moving slowly across the sky as it moved it rotated around where I could see it was flat or like a disk then it would continue rolling and it was a circle again.  Kind of like a Frisbee rolling from top to bottom.   I called to my wife, she came out, ran back in to grab the binoculars, she said it was gray with dots on it.  We continued to watch it until it was too far to the west and the trees blocked out view.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273

Fluorescent green colored disc shaped object notice in Kirkland (Washington) night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor.  PD));2015-05-30 02:15:00;4 seconds;Fluorescent green colored disc shaped object notice in Kirkland (Washington) night sky. Event Time:  Friday late night/early Saturday (2:15AM)  It was a hot Friday evening, so I had slid open the windows of our master bedroom.  My 9.5 month old son was awake & playing with my husband.  It was almost dark in the room.  I thought of closing the windows & blinds before going off to sleep, when I noticed a fluorescent green colored disc shaped light moving towards North-West direction from left to right horizontally. This was just for approximately 4 seconds, so I didnâ€™t get the chance to capture any image.  I looked around afterwards to check if there were any clouds & to my fortune, I found the moon shining brightly in the sky to my left.   Then I immediately looked at the wall clock in our room to note the time.  The clock was ticking at 2:15.  The light I had seen was bright colored & its image got clicked in my mind, as I knew that this was something new & strange I had never noticed before. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object may have been a meteor. ((NUFORC Note:  This event is reported on the American Meteor Society website, and on the GoSky All Sky Network in British Columbia, Canada.
