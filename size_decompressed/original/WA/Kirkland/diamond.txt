These objects flew across the horizon almost wiith the permission of a ship that I was observinng with a friend of mine.   I believe I have seen this ship before,  and often.  It is probably a copter, but... It makes no sound, and I witnessed it along wiith approx. 5 others onn 9/3/96 over Bellevue.  The ships tonight came into sight at approx 30,000 ft or above(they were way up there)as they were flying off to the East from around the Everrett  area, I would suppose,  anyway, they mooved verry fast,  and broke formation-                       1                                                    1                                                           2                                                    2                                                     3                                                             3                                                       4                                                 4                                                     5                                                                 5                                         6                                                              6                                It seemed that the 3rd annd thhe 5th broke formation and moved forwad.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
