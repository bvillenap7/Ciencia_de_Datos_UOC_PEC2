Object shot across the sky at an amazing speed- Blue teardrop with silver center;2005-07-09 13:00:00;3-4 seconds;Object shot across the sky at an amazing speed- Blue teardrop with silver center Standing on my back deck in Kirkland, I was facing northeast looking across the fence at my neighbor who was weed wacking his back yard.  There was one large cloud in the distance.   I had just returned from the store was was enjoying a cigarette while I contemplated my lunch options.  I live on top of a hill and have a clear view out over the Forbes Creek area looking out towards the Totem Lake area.   All of a sudden into my field of vision from right behind me a teardrop shaped object shot across the sky.  I had a sight of this for approx. 3-4 seconds at the most steaking to the north east.  It had a silver almost metallic center with a blue outline that seemed almost like a halo or aura.   I have never known anything on this planet to move with such speed and I have witnessed some very fast planes in person.  I could not really tell if the object was falling to earth as I did not see where it came from, so judging the height that it was traveling at was difficult.  It disappeared in to the clouds and I lost sight of it.  My feeling was that it was moving so fast and straight that it had come from behind me and was not falling to earth.   The colors were amazing.  Again nothing in my memory reveals any recognition of a color like the blue that I saw.  It was unnatural for this world is all I can say.  I called King 5's news desk and they gave me your information.  I find myself to be a pretty practical person and I do question many things.  I cannot explain what I saw or the rate of speed it was traveling.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
