I am a college professor and joined four college men on the hike near Slate Peak, the highest place you can drive in Washington state in the North Cascade mountains near the Canadian border. The 6,600 feet elevation trail head is at an old air force listening station manned in the 1940s which is now marked by an unmanned observation tower closed to the public.  Our camp was about five miles north east of the trail head on a very isolated ridge with no other campers for miles and miles. The Pasayten Wilderness is one thousand square miles. While a very large forest fire was burning in an eastern region of the wilderness, we were at a safe distance. The fire was at a much lower elevation about 35 miles east and two valleys and mountain ranges away.  The first night of our excursion, we were sitting around a small camp fire above the lake looking at a perfectly clear night sky. Then a few minutes after 11 PM we saw a bright light like an airplane in the south east above the mountain ridge skyline about 50 degrees high. It moved like a helicopter, but made no sound. It seemed to be about three or four miles away moving north west, seemingly flying above the Slate Peak observation tower.  Suddenly something shot out of the light. We were astonished. Did you guys see that!, I said. Yes, all but one student agreed.  He didn't bring his glasses and couldn’t see that clearly, but the other four of us all witnessed it. It looked like a shooting star, except it shot out of the airplane-like-light down towards the south east. We immediately thought that perhaps the projectile was a shooting star that just happened to shoot behind the light at the right moment, giving an illusion that the light was the source. Then one student said, Yea, but what are the odds that a shooting star would appear at exactly that point? We agreed that the sight was amazingly poignant.  The light then appeared to be moving directly towards us, as if to fly over our lake.  And I said, It must be a Forest Service helicopter. Put out the fire. There was a burn ban which I admit we were not obeying. Moments after the fire was put out with a bottle of water, the light turned away from us and moved directly east. It floated lazily, as if taking in the scenery. It did not move like a helicopter doing a job. And there was no sound. The light moved away and faded into the horizon, turning reddish as it  apparently disappeared behind the atmosphere. We witnessed the strange light for about five or six minutes.  We tried to think of what it could be. One of the group remarked that it couldn't be an airplane or jet because there was no discernable shape, no sound and looked like a single, bight ball of light, like a head light pointing at you. His father is a pilot and he seemed sure that it was not a fixed winged aircraft. We had seen Forest Service spotter aircraft looking for lightening fires all day long and could hear the roar of their engines long before we could see them. We all joked that maybe this light was a UFO.  The next day, I took out my compass and topo map and plotted what I thought was the line of flight. Then I realized that the light seemed to out line the eastern side of the wild fire about 35 miles away. Maybe it was farther away than we thought. So, I told the men that it must have been Forest Service helicopter shuttling fire fighting crews or dropping water or fire retardant.  Then on Monday evening we had another sighting. This time about 9 PM, after sun set but before you could see any stars, one of the men looked up at the same spot to the east and said, Look, the light is back! This time we saw the same intense point of light acting like an airplane flying away. We saw it for about one minute. It certainly looked exactly like the night before, except that we didn't get to watch it for very long to notice any thing strange. There was not sound.  Tuesday the weather turned to rain and thunder storm clouds obscured the night sky. We later learned that this storm caused some small fires in a valley to the north west of our lake. In the afternoon on Wednesday, we heard a helicopter approaching. Then a large K-Max helicopter flew over our lake tugging a 300 gallon scoop. It hovered over the lake, scooped up water then made a wide turn along the ridge and flew over our camp into the hills to the north to drop water on a small fire caused by the lightening the day before. In about five minutes it returned. The third time we heard it approaching we ran down to the lake to get a close up view. We were directly under the chopper as it hovered. It was huge and make a sound so loud that my ears are still ringing. We noticed blinking lights on the tail and end of the fuselage. It made five water scooping trips.  But, later we reflected on the contrast between the chopper and the light on Sunday and Monday nights. It seemed even more strange. Unlike the chopper, there was no sound. There were no blinking lights. It moved slow and funny. The projectile shooting out of it. That just could not be a helicopter.  We hiked out on Thursday to stay at a hotel before driving home to Seattle on Friday. The ski lodge hotel was catering breakfast and lunches for fire fighter crews because their base camp was a half mile away. As I paid our bill, I met a director of the ground crew operations and asked him questions about the type of aircraft fighting the fire. He said that they use Bell helicopters to shuttle the crews and K-Max choppers to scoop and drop water. I didn’t reveal why I was asking him all of these questions, but he ended by referring me to a forest service information officer at a head office in the town of Tonasket.  Then I asked one more question, Do the helicopters work at night?  Oh, no, he said.  They have to be able to see.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
Objects that look like flying stars.;2004-04-02 00:00:00;1.5 hours +;Objects that look like flying stars. I just saw 3 lights in the sky moving around. They looked just like stars. Then I watched 1 of them move very fast East in the sky from Orion's belt. I then stopped in another spot and stayed there. The other 2 just stayed where they were and moved everyonce in a while not to far, but enough to watch them move. They moved like nothing I have ever seen. The one that moved to the East moved very fast like a fighter jet, but then made very sudden moves in circles, and up and down. Then it stopped and has remained there since I was last outside. This is the 3rd time this week I have seen this. They also seem to emit something. I can see streaks of light, that are dim, around them. There is always 3 and they are never together, or in the same place. When they aren't flying around they stay pretty motionless, moving from time to time, but they have strobe lights on them. Atleast it looks like strobes. Everytime I see them I come inside and get my wife. So she has seen them also.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
Slow moving UFO spotted from Kirkland, WA ((NUFORC Note:  Blimp??  PD));2004-09-02 20:15:00;5 minutes;Slow moving UFO spotted from Kirkland, WA I was standing on my deck observing the night sky when I noticed an odd object on the horizon while looking east.  The second observer, a close friend of mine, is an airplane and helicopter pilot.  I immediatly pointed out the object to him.  He concurred that he had never seen such an object before. It was horizontally oval in shape, light green in color, and appeared to be somewhat large in size considering the distance.  We observed the object for a few minutes as it moved slowly accross the horizon from south to north until it disappeared behind some trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports.  A blimp is in the Seattle area, currently.  PD));47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
bright light followed by a series of other lit up objects;2006-06-16 23:45:00;1min;bright light followed by a series of other lit up objects i'm speaking for a few friends here.. while on the phone around 11:45 pm last night 6/16/06 i was told to go outside by the friend over the phone to look at a crystal bright light moving across the sky SW-NW direction. way to bright to be a satelite no noise to be a plane since it wasn't all that high in the atmosphere and i didn't risk going for the camera since i was just stuck watching it, mezmorised somehow. and it disapears into the clouds. it was really bright! 5 minutes later i get a phonecall from a few friends freaking out about lights in the sky, and their place isn't that far from mine but i didn't see more than 1 light. maybe they witnessed something after i walked inside. their story is, no noise, hovering, moving in all directions and i think they said 3 objects.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
Can attest to the probability that the sightings were not of any conventional aircraft or natural phenomena of which I am aquainted.;2007-07-10 23:27:00;3 seconds;Can attest to the probability that the sightings were not of any conventional aircraft or natural phenomena of which I am aquainted. It was just a fast descending kind of white light seemingly coming from north downward in an southerly direction as if it were heading downward somewhere east of Kirkland.  Seemed to close to the ground to have been a shooting star and it did not appear to dissipate and it was somewhat larger anyway.  It was silent.  A few nights earlier also 2 witnesses observing a very high level very bright white object moving from south to north over Kirkland, Washington, at a very high altitude on a clear, cloudless night. The object suddenly dimmed by a factor of perhaps ten to twenty and kept moving northerly in the upper atmosphere as if it were a normal satellite although perhaps slightly faster (as have observed numerous satellites over the years.)It did not dissipate or burn up and just kept proceeding onward.  One speculation is that during its very bright phase right overhead the object may have been experiencing some kind of reentry (or entry) glow/burn while descending through the upper atmosphere although cannot claim to have seen have seen that before so do not know. In fact first impression was that it was already in the upper atmosphere and for some reason unclear, the object may have been intentionally many magnitudes brighter and thusly largely then suddenly dimming to (distant observer size) of a slightly faster moving satellite (similar in observation size to most stars observable on a clear night (cloudless.)  It definitely dimmed down practically went overhead of both witnesses.  The earlier reported light descending over Kirkland was mentioned to a taxi driver who said that she had seen something similar earlier over the freeway in the Kirkland vicinity.  Also would like to report (which uncannily had forgotten until reminded) about a year or so before, a daylight sighting at 3:55pm over Volunteer Park, Seattle, on a clear sunny day a bright star like object stationed directly over head above Fifteenth Avenue East and East Republican (observed by several passers by and small business owner.   The object remained overhead for it seemed like maybe a dozen minutes. Most said it appeared unusual but soon lost interest and thought it may have been a daytime bright planet sighting and went about their way.  However (this observer) witnessed the bright silvery object eventually proceed to move slowly in a southerly direction and therefore walked several blocks in order to track the object as it passed above Fifteenth Avenue East, directly over the Aquarian Foundation Spiritualist Medium Church and the Safeway store next to it.  Did not report this to the members there fixing their church wall and as they were bust on ladders (although in retrospect maybe should have as they profess an interest in non terrestrial entities themselves).  The silvery slow moving bright sphere carried on slowly southwards toward South Seattle seemingly in no hurry whatsoever and making no effort to cloak itself in any way and was very clear from a third floor veranda until it was eventually to far gone over south Seattle to continue to maintain observation of the bright silvery (perhaps a very slight blue tint) object which remained silent.  Have speculated that if these were indeed human experimental vehicles, they are beyond current understanding of the general population.  If heretofore vessels were of a non terrestrial intelligent nature then they were making no attempt to cloak or stealth themselves) possibly wishing to be observed at that moment in time. Also have considered that if they are of say a galactic park ranger or scientific observer mission, they may be scanning the area with advanced technology to determine possible near future earthquake or volcanic activity in the Pacific Northwest region.  Another possible speculation is that such objects may have some form of mind link ability and may make themselves known to certain individuals and groups for some unknown reason.  Oh, almost forgot to mention about a week ago while riding on a bus across 520 bridge from Seattle to Kirkland, two spherical ! dark obj ects hovering over the exclusive beach front area, one above the other perhaps hundreds of feet, possibly over the Medina area.  No one on the bus seemed to say or not anything and did not raise alarm by asking others what they might be.  They just seemed to be hanging in the air only hundreds of feet above the area (possibly close to where a well known soft ware developer may reside.)  Thought they could have been some promotional balloons for some event although they did not appear tethered.  They were spherical and a darkish color, one perhaps a hundred feet above the other and maybe a few hundred feet above the ground, seemingly stationary and silent, perhaps as large as a house, they seemed a couple of miles away. Definitely could not say what they were.  Definitely could say they were not a conventional aircraft or helicopter.

Just a light...possibly a satelite, that's about it thus far.;2007-07-18 22:48:00;30 Seconds;Just a light...possibly a satelite, that's about it thus far. Aloha Peter First one I've seen in many moonths it seems. Full Moon Friday to be exact 7/18/07. Possibly a satellite although not the usual trajectory of most satellites going overhead of which there are quite a few. Object moving high in atmosphere from (I reckon) southwesterly to northeasterly. Maybe they're here for Seafair Festival (perhaps like the Mexico City sightings over the parade in Mexico City.) Being undoubtedly far more intelligent than whatever passes for many of the humans on planet, they probably have a sense of humor, unlike many humans. I hope so.  Personally,I'm hoping an entire fleet of saucers flies over and freex the entire Seattle area out and gives them all a good wakeup from whatever hypnospell they've all been operating under for the past few years.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273

2 light formations circling venus;2010-10-19 19:00:00;10 minutes;2 light formations circling venus I was driving to my astrology class and was noticing how amazing Venus was sitting directly underneath the moon, it did not feel normal to me or normal for how I usual see it.   I wanted to share this with my teacher, upon arrival at class, I parked where I could see venus perfectly, as I looked up at it again I saw two lights hovering by it and seeming to be in relationship with one another, moving back in forth, then the two lights started to move in between venus and the moon.  I called the whole class out to see this as it was so amazing.  I did not know who to tell or where to report thank you for your site and work.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
Odd light seen from Kirkland facing west.;2011-12-24 22:35:00;15 minutes or so;Odd light seen from Kirkland facing west. OK, I know the timing makes this sound like a hoax or joke but I observed a red object high in the sky at approximately 22:30.  I first thought it was a planet but it had a zig zag flight pattern.  I seemed to cover quite a bit of area in little time but was holding a hover and would zig zag.  I know Christmas eve and all but both my wife and I observed it and have no explanation.  Maybe laser in the sky?;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
Fast bright white light over Kirkland.;2013-06-04 23:30:00;3 minutes;Fast bright white light over Kirkland. We saw a very bright light moving at a high and steady rate of speed traveling west to east.  No sound was heard, we did not see aircraft strobes, and it was the brightest light we've ever seen in the sky at night.  Much brighter than any aircraft.  It was possibly a cluster of lights very high in the sky.  It was higher than the landing aircraft en route to Seatac we normally see.  We feel like it was high enough to be just below the satellite altitude, but it was entirely too fast, too large, and too bright to be a satellite. Absolutely no sound, and very bright white light.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273

It was a clear sky, as I saw the stars & constellations were clearly visible.   I stopped to check if that was a plane (aircraft), but no, that wasn’t the case, as I didn't hear any sound & observed that the light pattern was somewhat unusual.  It was blinking within fractions of seconds & with the blinks the colors were changing quickly, or rather I should say switching colors:  blue, green, red & white.   It was moving from South-East to West.  I could only see the light flashing in on & off mode every second & there was fast switching of all the colors (blue, green, red & white) with every on I saw.

There were no blinking lights like an aircraft would have. I thought it slowed down and then went behind the tall trees in front of us.  We saw it a few times moving through the high tops.  We kept waiting for it to come out to the left in the open but it never reappeared.  To me that rules out the space station and satellite.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
