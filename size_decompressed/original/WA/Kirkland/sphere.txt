3 different colored round objects moving at different speeds and different directions mid afternoon.;2004-07-18 15:00:00;10 minutes;3 different colored round objects moving at different speeds and different directions mid afternoon. My wife and I were laying in our backyard on towels looking up at the sky.  We both saw a sphere, silver colored hovering at approx. 50,000 to 70,000 feet.  Below the very high cloud cover.  I went and got 2 sets of binoculars for us to see better.  We had a stationary tree as a reference point.  In the binoculars we could see it was round, silver and moving slowly west.  Then a smaller light, could only make out it was shining in the light, a glistening spec, blinked in slowly next to it.  The larger sphere always moved slowly west.  Thought it may have been a weather balloon.  The smaller one moved from above the sphere to below it, around it and then to the east.  The sphere moved with the clouds west.  It seemed as if the small light was moving around the sphere in several different directions at different speeds.  Then a red sphere appeared in the field.  So now 3 objects are visible all next to each other.  The small light moved southeast and blinked out.  The red smaller sphere moved away to the east and blinked out as the original siver sphere continued moving west until it was out of vision to the horizon.  These objects were very high up.  Very small even with the binoculars.  I assumed the two smaller objects that blinked out moved behind the cloud cover, which at that time was about 50,000 to 70,000 feet. It appeard as if the two smaller ones were examining the larger silver sphere, then they lost interest and left.  We both saw the same thing at the same time.  I am an electrical engineer and it was the oddest thing I have ever seen in the sky.  It was not a plane.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
Second day we watched this sphere, no additional objects with it as there were the day before.;2004-07-20 19:30:00;5 minutes;Second day we watched this sphere, no additional objects with it as there were the day before. This is day two my wife and I saw the same sphereical object moving in the sky approx. 50,000 to 70,000 feet altitude.  I went into my backyard to look at the sky since we saw the 3 objects yesterday.  After about 3 or 4 minutes, I saw the original silver sphere moving the same direction (west) as I saw the day before.  I told my wife to come out and that it was back.  She saw it, I went in to get the binoculars to see it better.  She kept watch on it.  We both looked at it again magnified and it was silver and a sphere.  At that height, It was probably a little smaller than a jet flying at about 40,000 feet.  This time we didn't see any other objects like we did yesterday flying around it (see my report from yesterday). Then at once, it blinked out...gone.  There was no high cloud cover this time like there was the day before.  I still had the trees as a still reference.  I think the odds of seeing this thing twice in two days is really strange.  The objects from the day before moved in odd directions around it and changed direction and speed.  This main sphere kept the same course during both sightings.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
Seeing the sphere again and again very high, red/orange this time;2004-07-23 15:00:00;2 minutes;Seeing the sphere again and again very high, red/orange this time Again my wife and I watched this very high round object moving smoothly in the sky.  Same size and height as before.  It was firey orange/red this time, not silver.  We both looked at it with binoculars again.  We go outside to look for it on the weekends now and sometimes after work...and usually we see it.  That is very odd to me.  It was moving North to South this time.  Then is blinked out after a few minutes. We sat there looking more and after about 20 minutes we saw it, or another one again.  Same size, height, but silver this time.  It moved in a zig zag motion quickly this time, then shot away behind the tree line.  It is very high, maybe 50,000 to 70,000 feet it seems.  I can't believe we are seeing it so often.  I see other people here are seeing the same thing we are.  That makes me feel a bit better.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
AGAIN I saw the very high sphereical object moving in circles this time, zig zag sort of.  It was very orange/red this time again.  I w;2004-07-26 19:30:00;1 minute;AGAIN I saw the very high sphereical object moving in circles this time, zig zag sort of.  It was very orange/red this time again.  I went outside to see if I can see it last night after work.  It seems when ever we go out to look for it, wait 15 or 20 minutes, we see it.  My wife was inside this time.  I saw it, looked through my binoculars and saw it moving around right above me.  Very high.  Still a round sphere.  I called my wife to come out and see again.  I kept my eyes on it the whole time.  You can see it with your bare eyes okay, but better with binoculars.  This is the 5th one I have seen in about a week, or the same one 5 times.  Good thing I see so many other people here seeing this.  It moves back and forth, sometimes smoothly in one direction.  This time just before my wife got out, it moved West extremely fast out of sight.  Like almost a blur.  As high as it is, it must have really gone fast.  I make it a habit now of going outside after work with binoculars and I usually see it now.  It is really making me wonder what the heck this is.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
15-20 orange spheres floating in triangular patterns in the night sky would disappear in peculiar ways, and sound was suppressed.;2016-03-25 22:00:00;14 minutes;15-20 orange spheres floating in triangular patterns in the night sky would disappear in peculiar ways, and sound was suppressed. My girlfriend and I (during our college spring break) were driving near my home in Kenmore, WA, at around 9:50 PM.  All of a sudden, we spotted strange lights overhead.  We started freaking out because of how eerie these lights looked, and we opened the doors and got out of the car several times to take pictures and look at the lights.  They were orange and very illuminated, sphere shaped, and were floating in a certain pattern in the sky.  They seemed to be clustered into triangular formations, 3 in each triangle.  All in all, around 15 lights were seen, maybe more, and no more than 7 or so lights at any given time. The lights vanished at different places, and when I say vanished, I don't mean they simply faded instantaneously.  When they would disappear, my girlfriend and I could both clearly see the back of each light when the front would vanish, almost like they were sucked into a portal.  While that sounds corny, it's the only analogy I can really think of.  During the entirety of the sighting, all sound was noticeably quieter, almost as if it were being suppressed, with the exception of an odd rippling sound coming from an unknown source.  The window on the driverâ€™s side of my 2006 Trailblazer wouldn't roll down during the sighting, and has been faulty since.  A plane was spotted flying near the lights during the middle of the event, and about a minute or two after the last light disappeared, another plane flew in the direction the lights were headed, this time at a speed faster than a plane normally flies.  All of the lights were going exactly west, towards the! Puget Sound.  The final lights were seen shortly after 10:00 PM. Throughout the encounter, both I and my girlfriend were freaking out.  My girlfriend was scared during the entirety of the sighting, and I was on edge as well.  While neither of us have any background or extensive knowledge about any types of aircraft, we both agreed we had never seen anything like it.  I have one good video taken via snapchat, and while it shows several of the lights, it doesn't even come close to what the real encounter was like.  During the video, you can see one of the lights accelerate as some of the lights would do, then disappear.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
