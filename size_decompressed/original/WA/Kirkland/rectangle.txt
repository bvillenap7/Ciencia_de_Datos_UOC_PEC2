An open rectangle in the sky above Seattle;2006-09-01 01:00:00;5 sec;An open rectangle in the sky above Seattle It has been a few months since I saw this rectangle in the sky. I didn't know there was an official reporting website until I read an article in the UFO Magazine. I did write a report about this with another UFO website but not this one. What I saw in the sky won't take long to describe....it was what looked like an open rectangle in the sky maybe a mile high. I was looking to the west and determined it was just a little north of Seattle. I had just taken an exit off of I405 and on the overpass bridge heading west I saw it. Plain as seeing a blimp. It was all but imipossible to determine the size of it but it was easy to tell that it was big enough for something to fly through it. My view of this thing didn't last long because the traffic was heavy and I couldn't stop. It was so obvious I thought I would have heard about it on the news that day but there was nothing about it. I am 59 years old and have never done a hoax about anything. It's not my way of having fun. But, this is what I saw.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273

It was far too long to be an airplane, it made no noise whatsoever, and it moved quite a bit faster than a plane. Because it was dark at this time, I couldn't make out a shape, but believe it is best described as a long line or rectangle, at least the part of it that I could see.  From the time I first saw it directly above me, while standing outside on my balcony, I watched it for about 15 seconds until it disappeared. I was facing the south, and the object was flying from the west to the east.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
