I watched it rotating in the sky with occasional green and red shimmering lights.  It was long from top to bottom, almost cylindrical and just rotated clockwise while moving westward.  Very sunny day with light clouds.  Clouds passed through it as it spun and moved left/westward.  Interestingly a very high in altitude plane flew to the left of it and had no visible exhaust and did not show up on my flight app.  Eventually the rotating craft completely disappeared from sight.  Absolutely incredible.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
