Fireball, two witnesses, holy crap.;2015-12-04 19:30:00;3-5 seconds;fireball, two witnesses, holy crap. Initial witness saw a full 5 seconds of blue and red fireball....second witness saw a second and a half of yellow/white.  It appeared to both witnesses as a gigantic shooting star.  Much larger than a normal shooting star.  Researched on-line and found no other reports . Traveling from east to west, easily 100 times the size of a shooting star. Colors not concurrent to a normal meteorite entry.  Cloud cover was an interference but there was a sufficient gap to see the event.  The fact that we were even looking in that direction as we were going out to the car and witnessed the event was a million to 1.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
