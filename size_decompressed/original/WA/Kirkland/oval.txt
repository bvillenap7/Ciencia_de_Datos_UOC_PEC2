Very large, Very Slow, completely lighted aircraft over Lake Washington   ((NUFORC Note:  Blimp??  PD));2004-09-02 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Very large, Very Slow, completely lighted aircraft over Lake Washington It was VERY bright and VERY large.  It moved very slowly at a a seemingly low altitude.  The whole craft was lighted (unlike a plane with spotlights) and the color of light was like a halogen bulb would give. There was only one craft.  I observed it travelling east from north Seattle over what seemed like St. Edwards Park.  It was like it was mapping something.  Speed was very steady and slow.  When I noticed it, I immediately went outside to observe.  It didn't give off any sound.  I have never seen an aircraft like it and called my husband to see.  He, too, felt that it was like nothing he had ever seen before. We lost sight of it when trees obstructed our view.  I wondered at first what it was, trying to think of what aircraft would give off such light.  I first thought about a blimp as it was somewhat the same shape.  It seemed larger than that though and the lights didn't jive with that.  If it is a domestic plane, it was VERY large, quiet and the whole thing was lit up! ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports.  A blimp is in the Seattle area, currently.  PD));47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
