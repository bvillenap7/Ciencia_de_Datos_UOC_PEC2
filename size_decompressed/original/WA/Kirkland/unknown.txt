I saw a large rectangle hanging over north Seattle, WA;2006-08-12 13:00:00;Short;I saw a large rectangle hanging over north Seattle, WA My particular sighting was not a craft of any kind but it was very interesting. What I saw was a rectangle in the sky sitting over Seattle Wa. It looked so obvious that I thought there might be something on the news or people talking about it. But there wasn't. I told a few people, but you can image the response someone gets for seeing a rectangle in the sky. This was not a UFO. I only had a very short view of this due to traffic and trees. The shape of this was like a rectangle drawn on a piece of paper. It was just hanging there. I could not say the size of it but there was definitely enough size to it to make it easy to see looking across Lake Washington over to perhaps the north Seattle area.(appox. 4 to 5 miles...maybe less).  I was thinking that it might be a gate to another dimension. I am 58 years old and have never reported a strange sighting before. It was a bright and clear, blue sky, summer afternoon. That rectangle was there and I will never say otherwise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273

Hello Peter Unlike last summer, there appears to be an absence of UFOs in the sector (unless they remain cloaked.)  This is quite perplexing. Is it possible that Coast To Coast/Art Bell could do a live Halloween special broadcast from NUFORC base?  I shall bring the chupacabras!;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
Many people saw a flat black bow shaped UFO for 30 minutes and then suddenly disapPeared.;2011-05-20 12:00:00;40 minutes;Many people saw a flat black bow shaped UFO for 30 minutes and then suddenly disapPeared. During a passing period during school, many students and teachers saw a large bow shaped UFO hovering around our area.   Once my class started we headed outside to watch this funominone, we watched it for around 30 or so minutes.   This object had a flat black color to it, there was no sound, it looked like a bow without a string and it was hovering over the ground but not moving.  It would instantly switch from one position to another in a snap of a finger.   First it was in a up right position and then suddenly it fliped on its side. Then it went back to it's upright postion and  started to spin suddenly at high speeds and looked like an oval.  It stopped spinning as soon as a passanger plane passed right by it.  Then it began spinning again and then started to move left to right at high speeds.  Then suddenly it was gone.   No one had a clue what it was, but all we know is that it is a UFO.
