I asked my sons, What is THAT, and we watched the objects. They were high overhead and completely silent. They had straight cylindrical bodies and wings curled slightly downward. There were no lights and nothing on the objects moved or changed, they all glowed with the same faint greenish white glow, hazy around the edges. They swooped together and milled about, then formed a clumsy V type formation and shot off together to the north. They were not planes, birds or firefles. (Planes have lights and make noises, birds move their wings and fireflies do to. Besides, they were too high up for the objects to be as small as birds or fireflies). This is the first time any of us have ever seen anything odd in the sky.;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273

This craft had no sound and no rotors that could be seen, but could hover in place and pivot around its central axis. A plane flew overhead about a mile from the craft. The craft hovered and rotated to face the plane which was flying away from it. It then rotated back to the north and flew off. I have pictures of said craft;47.6986531818182;-122.192672727273
