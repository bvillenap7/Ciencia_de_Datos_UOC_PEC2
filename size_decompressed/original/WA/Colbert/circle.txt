UFO paces aircraft.;2020-05-08 13:27:00;15 seconds;UFO paces aircraft. While watching an overhead aircraft making its way from east to west,  I saw a perfectly round silver metallic object pacing it . The object (UFO) was  going at the exact speed of the aircraft, it was located  slightly off the planes right side.... as I was looking up at it. There were fluffy clouds in the sky, and the plane and ufo were above them. The plane was not so high as to cause a vapor trail or exhaust. The round ufo was perfectly round, like a perfect drop of water. It had depth to it, like a perfect drop of water. I did video this with my phone, but its blurry, fuzzy and useless.;47.8442;-117.3808
