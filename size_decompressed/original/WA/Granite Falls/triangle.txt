Same object as the sighting on the 15th again with an additional object sighted in the North sky close to the horizon ((Jupiter??);2004-08-17 22:29:00;4 hours;Same object as the sighting on the 15th again with an additional object sighted in the North sky close to the horizon On August 15 at 22:15 my wife and I saw a single object in the NW sky about 50 degrees off the horizon. Tonight looking North we saw the same object in about the same position a little more to the west and higher making zig-zag movements. Tonight looking North we saw another object much closer to the horizon with green, yellow and red flashing lights moving in a zig-zag pattern much the same as the first object. Both objects were silent and continued to hover until I went to bed. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a planet, possibly Jupiter.  PD));48.0813;-121.9464
V-shaped lights seen in the sky.;2015-11-20 19:05:00;3 seconds;V-shaped lights seen in the sky. Approx. 5 minutes after our power went out at 7:00 PM, I was sitting on our back deck looking due east, 45 degrees to the horizon, night was clear when I noticed up behind a popular tree in the back yard one, then six other lights.   Each lighting up one by one from left to right in the shape of a v with a bluish-green hue.  The lights all went solid, blinked, went solid again then disappeared entirely.   In comparison to the stars in the sky, the lights were approximately three times that size.  The power came back on about ten minutes after the sighting.;48.0813;-121.9464
