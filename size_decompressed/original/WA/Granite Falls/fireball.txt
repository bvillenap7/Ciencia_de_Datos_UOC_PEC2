Brilliant green fireball was seen falling and trailing debris near Mt. Pilchuck;2003-11-05 20:26:00;1 - 2 seconds;Brilliant green fireball was seen falling and trailing debris near Mt. Pilchuck My daughter and I were northbound on Mountain Loop Highway near Granite Falls Middle School when we observed a large, brilliant green fireball fall into view through the windshield.  Burning debris was visible breaking away from the main fireball.  A slight trail was seen.  The fireball either burned out, but did not break up, or was obscured by Mt. Pilchuck. Fireball was first seen 30-40 degrees above horizon and traveled in a path about 20 degrees from vertical.  No sound was heard.  The color was so brilliant that we first thought it was fireworks.  Apparent diameter half that of #2 pencil held at arms length viewed end-on. I contacted a rifle range that is located in the direction of where the fireball was observed and verified that no signal flares were fired.  I contacted Snohomish County Search and Rescue and the Granite Falls Police Department and no reports of signal flares were received by either agency. I am a beginner amateur astronomer and avid aircraft enthusiast with 25 years experience in technical field.  My daughter is a 16 year old student. ((NUFORC Note:  Several reports received of this incident.  We suspect that it was a meteor, but that is only a guess.  PD));48.0813;-121.9464
Green fireball fell south and east of Granite Falls, WA;2003-12-18 16:45:00;2 seconds;Green fireball fell south and east of Granite Falls, WA Traveling east on SR-92 I observed a large (approximately the size of a paper match head held at arm length) bright green fireball falling in an easterly direction to the south. I was 2 to 3 miles west of Granite Falls. The object was falling at approximately a 45 degree angle.  Object was ablating as it fell and 2 or 3 large pieces were seen breaking off of the main object. The fireball burned out approximately 30 to 40 degrees from the horizon. No sound was heard. Very similar in appearance to green fireball I observed on 11/5/03 though it was a lighter green and the sky was lighter. I expect there will be several reports since this fell during rush hour traffic.;48.0813;-121.9464
A green fireball traveling west to east with slight left to right path just outside of Granite Falls.;2005-02-22 20:40:00;1 sec;A green fireball traveling west to east with slight left to right path just outside of Granite Falls. I was heading east on Hwy 92 just entering Granite Falls. I saw a green fireball that looked much like a flare. I spotted it just as it was going over the horizon. It was traveling west to east with a slight left to right path. The object was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. It was a nearly full moon and very clear sky.
