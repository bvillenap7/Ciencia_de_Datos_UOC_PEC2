Heading east on highway 92 out of Granite Falls we drove out of town to the Green Mountain Road also known as Three Fingers mountain. Drove up the road approx. 2 miles to a extremely dark and secluded overlook of the valley below. We were there trying to get a broad view of all the fireworks down in the cities and towns below us. As my father and I stood around looking at all the fireworks, my father asked hey, what's that up there? I turn left and look up and spot a very bright, intense, white sphere of light. This ball of light appeared to be a satellite at first moving extermely fast from west to south east. Then as we watched, it suddenly started to move about unlike ANY conventional aircraft we've EVER seen. It veered left at extraordinary velocity, then right, then arched in a rainbow type trajectory at incredible speed. Maneuvers completely unseen and probably impossible in any traditional aircraft we know of. We watched this ball for about 60 seconds after which is darted behind a mountain, not to be seen by us again that night. The ball made no noise at all and put my father and I in a state of excitement unmatched by any fireworks. Very remarkable holiday.;48.0813;-121.9464

I'm sure it was round, but it had something hanging like a baloon string, but it also could have been a light from whatever it was. When my doughter came back to the car it was still up there, but she would not look up and by the time I would have told her again it was past the Post Office, and I could no longer see it,I don't know what it was, but it was strange.;48.0813;-121.9464
