One night my window started to flash;2000-10-10 22:00:00;1min;One night my window started to flash one night in October, not sure of exact date, around 10 pm my window began to flash. My brother and i got up to see what was out side, thinking it was someone being pulled over. But, when we looked out the window we didn't see anything that could cause the flashing . We figured it was a couple of cops driving by. when we laid back down i noticed after a minute that our window was still flashing. this time when we looked out the window i looked to the east sky toward Seattle, and above the tree line we saw a reddish- green colored diamond, with orange sparks shooting from the four sides. still the only thing that was flashing was our window, no other object outside was flashing.  After a moment of trying to figure out what the light was, i cam to the conclusion it was a ufo and ran down the hall screaming ufo! ufo! to my parents. they brushed us off when they looked outside and saw nothing in the sky.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
