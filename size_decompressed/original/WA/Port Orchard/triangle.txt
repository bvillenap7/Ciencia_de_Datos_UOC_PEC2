Triange Port Orchard, WA  Witnessed at 2 different locations;2005-02-04 18:40:00;3 min;Triange Port Orchard, WA  Witnessed at 2 different locations I was traveling on Sidney Road from Port Orchard toward Hwy 302. I was approaching the Port Orchard airport when I saw 2 bright white lights (looked like headlights) ahead and to my right. The object was flying low. The object then turned right (my left) and traveled directly over my car. There were the two bright white lights in the front, one smaller white light in the back, and two small red lights in the center. The object appeared to be triangular in shape. There were no strobing lights and no sound that I could detect. This happened at 18:40. When I returned home, I called my daughter and she reported seeing what sounds like the same object on her way home. She sighted the object at the other end of Sidney Road as she traveled from downtown Port Orchard toward Tremont Ave. She saw two bright white lights on her left. The object was traveling to her left, then appeared to go upward and then turned right to the direction of Seattle. She also stated the object to triangular in shape and had no strobing lights or sound. She experienced her sighting at about 18:45 for a duration of about 3-4 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite objective and credible.  We do not know what she and her daughter witnessed.  PD));47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627

My daughter pointed towards the left at two big, bright, white lights, resembling headlights in the sky. I slowed down and watched it glide towards us. It had a smaller white light in the back, with no strobing lights, and appeared to be triangular in shape. I parked as it was gliding upwards behind trees. I had the window rolled down and did not hear noise coming from the object. It then moved away from us, completly behind the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from daughter.

It went right over my head and I couldnt hear anything.  In the distance I could see a bar of steady white lights floating in the sky.  I looked away and it disappeared.  It really scared me.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
Three red light triangular UFO over Port Orchard, Washington.;2013-12-30 21:00:00;5-10;Three red light triangular UFO over Port Orchard, Washington. Dear, National UFO Reporting Center, On December 30, 2013, I encountered a mysterious fly object it had 3 red lights and it flew over my house and it was really close and it was a very big flying object.  At first I thought it was a secret us military plane of some sort. Then it flew over my house really slow than sat over my house for about 3 minutes then it disappeared into the sky like no one ever saw it.  At first my friend was leaving to go home then he said, “Hey, come and look at this!   Then, I started to freak out and I ran to my house and told my grandmother what I had encountered she said oh my god really?  And I said yes well I went back outside and it was still hovering over my house and then I told my sister what happened and she also freaked out. So I went to my neighbor who was recording a video of it and she tried to save the video and for some reason she could not save it and I thought that was weird.  So my friend who encountered it first talked to my neighbor and she saw it too and she said it was a UFO and that is what I said too so it’s still a mystery from that night what I saw.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627

It fell behind the trees and a moment later, I seen three very bright lights witched seem to move as one, at tree level in a triangle shape it looked almost like a large commercial jet, preparing to land on the road.   When I started to pull off the road to take a picture, it started to bank right, very slowly so slow that if it were a plane it would have stalled.  Now the three lights moving as one where one were on top of the other it disappeared.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627

Huge Triangle shaped objects in formation over Port Orchard, WA.;2019-10-02 22:21:00;2-3 seconds;Huge Triangle shaped objects in formation over Port Orchard, WA. On a clear evening, Big Dipper was very clear, my Dad and I were sitting around a campfire. He was sitting next to me and said “look” in a surprised and alarmed voice.  I was looking down but looked up and saw a very huge formation of triangles.   At first it resembled a flock of geese but immediately new that was wrong. It resemble a flock of geese because of it’s  ‘V’ formation and the distance between the triangles was similar to the distance between geese. The size was amazing.  If I extend my arm and extend my hand it nearly took up my entire hand.  There were 5 or 6 triangles on the left part of the ‘V’ and 5 or 6 on the other right hand part.  Over to the right was another ‘V’ shape but further away or at a different angle.  We only saw this object for 2-3 seconds.  It was flying from east to west,  almost directly over our heads..  Each triangle was the same shape and size.  The size of each one is difficult to determine.  I drive to Seattle Tacoma International airport frequently and when I see an airplane in the pattern I put my hand up in front of me to try to gauge the size in comparison.  All the aircraft around Sea Tac appear to be small compared to these triangles.  Both my Dad and I seemed to think the object was very high in the sky.  My estimate is that each triangle was the size of 2-4 large aircraft nose to tail. Each triangle was perpendicular to the earth.  The entire formation moved as one and traveled sideways.  Each triangle appeared to be separate. There was nothing visible that connected them. There was no apparent indication of movement.  There was no sound.  It seemed to move with great speed.  From the time we first spotted it to when it left our field of vision was 3 seconds top.  We could see it getting smaller as it flew towards the Olympic Mountains. We think it flew out of our sight. If so the speed would be incredible.  We regularly see jets flying towards the north end of the mountains on their way to Asia.  We see these aircraft for more than a minute.  Port Orchard is approximately 30 miles from Sea Tac. There were no lights we associate with aviation. The only light was a white-yellowish glow coming from each triangle.  The glow was contained to the middle in a slight oval shape. Some of the light spilled over to reveal straight edges of the triangle. Each of the triangles had the same color and light amount.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
