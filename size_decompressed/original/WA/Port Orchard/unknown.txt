Flying Saucer nightmare with unexplained noises.;1971-08-15 01:00:00;3-5 minutes;&quotFlying Saucer&quot nightmare with unexplained noises My next story is strange not exactly a sighting, but a strange circumstance, and you can decide yourself about it.  My twin sister(fraternal) and I were maybe 12 or 13 y.o. but no older than 14.  We didn't feel like putting the clean sheets on our beds one day, so with our parents' permission we decided to sleep out on the hide-a-bed in the living room.  We thought it would be great fun.  There were folding doors that closed off the living room from the dining room and family room.  At that time, there was no carpet in those areas. I woke up because my sister was shaking, scared to death.  She told me that she had been dreaming a 'flying saucer' was chasing us around the house.  We would run from room to room and it followed us.  We looked out the family room sliding door and there it was.   When we ran to the living room it circled around to that side of the house.  She woke up from the dream and told me that something big had hit the garage door so hard the screen! door by us had rattled.  I hadn't heard a thing, so was trying to calm her down and tell her it was just part of the dream.  What happened next is something that my sister still doesn't like to talk about,  Something started running around on the other side of the folding doors or at least, that's what it sounded like to us.  Like a child wearing patent leather shoes was running around the dining and family rooms. We were petrified, could hardly breathe.  I wanted to get up and run get our parents, but I was afraid that something would grab me when I ran by the kitchen, so we just lay still and held on to one another.  I don't know how long it lasted, but Paula suddenly sat up and yelled, What is it?  The noise instantly stopped.  It doesn't make sense at all, but we apparently just went back to sleep. Also, our cat never moved during the entire episode.  The next day we got up the nerve to tell our mother about it.  With hindsight, I think she was trying to make us feel better, because she brushed it off and said that we were imagining it.  When I asked her how two people can imagine the same thing at once, she had no answer.  Our older sister was at the table and then men! tioned that she had heard something during the night, but just assumed it was the twins up messing around.  Weird things just seemed to happen to us.

My grandaughter also went out, so there were 3 adults and 1 child watching this object high in the night sky. It seemed to have various lights on it-two were yellow and the third appeared to be a bluish tinted light. The cradt was definately not a helicopter, or an airplane as it made wide loops and then sudden 'jumps' straight up and then moments later straight downward. It would stop suddenly and hover and seem to spin, revealing a change in the lighting. At these points when it would stop-it almost appeared cylinderical, however it was difficult to see the actual shape as it's altitude was rather high. We could also see to the South east planes on their takeoff pattern from Seatac. The planes elevation was at least 2 - 4 thousand feet lower than the craft we were all observing. We were transfixed with the object. I then remembered your web site as I heard it on George Noory's Coast to Coast AM radio show. While my family continued to observe. I found your website and asked my husband to report it, however, I beleive he was a bit nervouse and left out a little information, that is why I called again and left a seconf message.We are interested if anyone else in the Kitsap County, Pierce County, or King County areas may have reported somthing similar.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
Firey object going across early morning sky from S.E. to N.W. in Washington State!;2007-07-16 00:52:00;30 seconds;Firey object going across early morning sky from S.E. to N.W. in Washington State! I was out walking my dog (last walk of the night for my dog), and there was alot of cloud cover. I was looking in the sky toward the west, because the previous night I spotted a sateilite flying over the Bremerton, Wa. Shipyard, then over the Bangor, Wa.  Sub-base. Seeing sateilite's in this area at night is quite common. As I was looking toward the west an object on fire was traveling overhead out of the southeast and traveling on a straight line to the northwest. I could only watch it for 30 seconds in and out of cloud cover until it disappeared into some thick clouds toward the Green Mtn. area of Western Washington State. This all happened at 52 minutes after midnight. I seen no other lights or heard any other noise (like a sonic boom etc.). I'm trying to be complete on what I seen, but due to the cloud cover and the speed of object I seen, I have no idea on the altitude of the object!;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
Low frequency pulsing followed by 30 minute power outage.;2015-02-11 02:30:00;30 minutes;Low frequency pulsing followed by 30 minute power outage. At approximately 0230, I was woken by a low frequency pulsing sound.  The best I can describe the sound in words is “WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB!”  My power flickered in my house but didn’t go out, then the sound came back, only louder this time, and then the power shut off in our entire neighborhood.   I figured maybe a transformer had blown because of a storm, but when I looked outside my window, the trees were all still, no wind and no rain.  I did notice that there was a thick haze everywhere, and in the dull ambient light outside, I could see what looked like a dark shadow moving through the air, it could’ve been clouds shifting in the air, but as I said, the trees were still.  There was a neighbor dog that was barking hysterically for a couple minutes after the event.  The power took approximately 30 minutes to come back and when it did, 2 of my 3 ceiling fans were on high speed, which is weird because we never put them on high speed, especially through the night because it makes it impossible to sleep.   It was a rather eerie event I have never heard or had anything like this happen before.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
