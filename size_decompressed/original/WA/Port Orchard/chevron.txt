Sometimes it looks like a V shape.  It is a very clear night, and I was looking at the moon.  The object moves around very slowly.  Stays in the same place, in proportion to the moon, more or less, but moves around very slightly. ((NUFORC Note:  We feel that a celestial body would have be ruled out first, in this case.
