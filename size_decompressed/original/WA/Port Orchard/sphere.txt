White sphere moving quickly pulsating and flashing west to East across the sky.;2020-05-13 22:40:00;1 minute;White sphere moving quickly pulsating and flashing west to East across the sky. A round shaped object flying west to East across the sky. The object at first seemed like a satellite, no sound and moving quickly. Upon further watching the object pulsates bright to almost dark and then bright again. During its path across the sky on 3 occasions when it pulsated bright it had an incredibly bright white flash that illuminated an aura about 100x itâ€™s small size and then continued to pulsate until moving out of view.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
Orange floating rotating ball, appears to follow me as I Walk around;2020-12-09 20:15:00;30 minutes;Orange floating rotating ball, appears to follow me as I Walk around I was doing my evening constitutional when I looked up in the sky and saw a large glowing, spinning orange light.  I took out my cell and started to video it, while also zooming in.  It seemed to notice me as I was filming it.   I followed just above me and to my right.  At one point the orange spinning object appeared to aflame and then go out completely.  As I started walking again I noticed that again the object was following me as I walked around the Sinclair inlet.   The object slowly floated away. I thought perhaps it was a drone but there was no sound and no outline of a drone or craft.  I noticed on the Mufon site, that Stevie saw the same thing but I was able to video tape my sighting.  Thanks!!!!;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
