Bright yellow with amber center seen over Port Orchard, Wa.;2014-07-04 22:30:00;5-10 seconds;Bright yellow with amber center seen over Port Orchard,Wa. On the night of July 4th while on the back deck of our family home next to Wal-Mart in Port Orchard, a bright light caught my eye through the Douglas Fir trees.  The bright light was yellow, like a fire, with a brown or amber color in the center.  It was shaped like an apple.  The light had no source meaning it seemed to be glowing.  I made a split decision to get my camera.  I was able to get a photo but as it headed southerly its light lessened and the photo didn't really come out.  I have a photo if you want me to send it?   This is exactly the same UFO I saw back in early June.  It was located about 2-5 miles east of our home, altitude 2,500 to 5,000 agl.  Its speed was similiar to a airliner on downwind.  Like my other sighting there was no normal lights like position lights, anti-collision lights, etc.   As it turned south, the light diminished.

Enormous ufo seen by 2 over Blake Island from Curly Creek.;2014-10-05 20:30:00;45 seconds;Enormous ufo seen by 2 over Blake Island from Curly Creek. A rectangle shape appeared above Blake Island.  Very large and dull grey in color.  It moved slowly over the island then preceded to slowly disappear.  2 very small red orbs became visible after larger one vanished.  They moved quickly darting about like sparks from a firework then they also vanished. The larger grey vehicle was enormous.  3 to 4 times bigger than our largest aircraft carries.  The sound it made was very low in tone.  I could feel it better than I could hear it.  ultra low frequency?;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
I witnessed one rectangular gray-white object flash across the sky and out of view.;2017-11-03 22:00:00;<1 second;I witnessed one rectangular gray-white object flash across the sky and out of view. I saw one shape flash across the sky. It was white-gray in color and moved quickly.  I'd say that it was at least four times the size of a plane and seemed to be rectangular, but it could've just been a fast disc form.   My uncle also saw this oddity.  He is currently working towards a degree in education, and I am a high school student.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
