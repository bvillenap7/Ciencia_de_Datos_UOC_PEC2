Fireball that just disappears;2003-12-22 20:38:00;3 seconds;Fireball that just disappears We were standing outside, looking at the stars and I was commenting on how low the clouds were blocking the view. We were looking in a north, northwest direction when a fireball appeared traveling northwest, almost in a slight angle. It was bright red with a long tail. As quickly as it appeared, it disappeared. It just went black. It didn't appear to have crashed into the ground as it went black above the horizon. It could have just disappeared in the clouds, but the clouds didn't seem to be that thick to me. It was an amazing sight and what perfect timing to be looking in that particular direction at that very second!;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
A bright orange looking star that moved In impossible ways and speeds.;2013-12-08 22:46:00;3 minutes;A bright orange looking star that moved In impossible ways and speeds. We were driving home and my friend In the back seat saidhey what is that.  We all looked at what looked like a bright orange light In the sky.  It was moving funny.  The driver of the car said it maybe the top of a cell phone tower.  It kept getting higher.  The driver said were pulling over to get a better look at this.  We pulled off the road and all got out.  It was directly above us and was moving back and forth when it came to a dead stop.  It started to dim I'n brightness and then shot off across the sky!  I'm not a big believer In UFO stuff and wouldn't belive this if I had not seen it with my own eyes.  Nothing man made moves like this and was not natural.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
