Constantly recurring Light (over years) that changes direction too fast to be anyhting known.;2002-04-24 23:30:00;2 hours;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses are seeing something other than UFO's.  They may be landing lights on aircraft, or perhaps celestial bodies.  PD)) Constantly recurring Light (over years) that changes direction too fast to be anyhting known. This is a recurring sight.  Nights vary, but over the past few years (first seen by myself Spring 1999) in the eastern sky, a very, very bright light frequently appears.  This light regardless of the season will always show up in the same general area of the sky.  It will go from being stationary to moving in figure eights, to north& south in the sky changing direction too fast to be anything I know of.  It will some times swing like a toy tied to a pole down left then down up, reversing direction and then doing so to the right.  Some nights it will stay out for hours (like tonight) some nights for minutes after being observed. Tonight, my friend and I were out enjoying a cigarette out side and I told him about the sightings and its general reliability.  Not believing me, we walked out into the street where it can be seen through the trees and it happened to be there.  Tonight we saw more movement on it than I have ever seen before.  We watched it for about an hour and it eventually worked itself so low on the horizon we had to go to another location to see it.  At about 00:15 on 04/25/02 we made it to South Kitsap School district #402's John Sedgwick Jr. High school and observed it from the football field.  It continued its bizarre movements, sometimes none, sometimes very violent and distant (about 4-6 inches in less than 2 seconds).  It worked its way down the sky (we marked our original position with Pepsi cans) and continued to walk backwards until it was too low to be seen over the hill.  I have fixed various telescopes and binoculars on it when it seems to be stationary and nothing signifigant can be made out about it.  It just becomes a larger bright light in the sky.  I know it cannot be a planet because its always is in the same general place in the sky no matter the season, it is too bright, and it moves so visibly.  Tonight it was only myself and my friend who viewed it, but my father and another friend of mine have all seen it over the years.  Just randomly assuming this object is only 150 miles away (and it has to be further because of the attempts to view it through magnification yields nothing) its movement variation is so radical, I know that nothing known can reverse direction, turn, or even move that fast. Time of day seems to vary, but it is always seen at night.  Every attempt to record the effect causes it to seemingly freeze (many attempts have been made by my father and myself).;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627

Single Red light slow and straight from west to east.;2007-01-29 18:00:00;10 minutes;Single Red light slow and straight from west to east. Looking south around 6:00 pm I saw a single red light moving very slow to the east. I watched it for 10 minutes. It went out of sight for a few seconds as if to go behind a cloud. It reappeared and then faded out a minute or so later. I looked through my hand in a cupped shape to block out any peripheral vision blur or flare. It looked just like a red star moving very slow.It did not blink,it was solid red the whole time,just a star sized red dot. It also did not change course. It moved in a seemingly straight line to the east. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
