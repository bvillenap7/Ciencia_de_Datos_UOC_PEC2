Bright flashes of changing color light filled the sky.;2009-01-05 02:00:00;20 seconds;Bright flashes of changing color light filled the sky. I was on my computer at my relative’s house in Port Orchard around 2:00am on January 5, 2009 and noticed outside that the sky had lit up like daylight but the whole sky had also lit up the color red.   As soon as I noticed this I rushed to the window and the sky had already changed colors to blue or green and then was changing colors again, each color lasted about 2-3 seconds, and filled the sky completely, the entire thing lasted about 20 seconds.   I had a clear view of the sky from the window and there was no visible cause for the lights.  It was very cloudy outside however with a low lying cloud layer and lots of snow.   I have read about a similar case of this happening in Melbourne, Australia, exact same details, so this most likely is a natural phenomena but I decided since I don’t know what it was I should probably report it.   This could be fireworks reflecting off the clouds, except no sound of them, could be a low lying airplane with its lights reflecting off the clouds except again no sound of it.   It could also be a meteor.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
Large-ish flash of light burst across the skyline;2017-11-03 22:00:00;1 second;Large-ish flash of light burst across the skyline in front of us as we were driving home.  It looked somewhat like a shooting star, but much larger and closer to the earth.  It was kind of a blur, but definitely very strange looking.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627
