Buzzing brilliant red rings.;2018-04-26 20:10:00;30 seconds;Buzzing brilliant red rings 	Thursday, the 26th of April, upon arriving home it was about 8:10pm, still daylight.  After unlocking my home I walked up my driveway to retrieve my mail.  After gathering the mail and proceeding back to my house, I began to hear a “buzzing” sound not unlike a bee. 	At first the sound was faint, but in a few seconds the noise increased in volume until it began to hurt my ears.  My first thought was it was a swarm of bees after me.  I started running to take refuge in my garage, but before going in, I looked back to see what it might be.  Seeing nothing, but still hearing the now unbearable sound, I looked to the sky and saw two red rings, very high in the sky traveling at a very high rate of speed. 	As quick as the noise appeared it disappeared, along with the red rings.  I ran into my home and called 911 and explained to the operator what I had just witnessed.  She told me a Sheriff’s Deputy would contact me.  The Deputy indeed did make contact and a report was filed. 	I am convinced that what I saw was not of this world, as I can think of nothing that flies as fast nor as high. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report is a very successful businessman.
