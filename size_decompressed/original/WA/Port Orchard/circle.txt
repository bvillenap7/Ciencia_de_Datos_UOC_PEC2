Large blue circular object observed falling at a 45 degree angle in Kitsap County.;2001-10-15 20:22:00;.05 seconds;Large blue circular object observed falling at a 45 degree angle in Kitsap County. I was traveling north on Hwy 16 from Gig Harbor to Port Orchard and was approximately 6 miles south of Port Orchard when I saw something very bright on my left (west) side.  I looked out my window and saw a bright object traveling down at a 45 degree angle from south to north fairly fast.  When the light caught my attention I thought that it was a shooting star but as soon as I saw it realized that it was much larger than any shooting star I've ever seen.  It was round, slightly larger than a quarter (1 1/2 inch diameter) and was blue in the center surrounded by a white halo that extended approx. 3 inches around the circle.  I lost sight of it when it disappeared below the tree line.  I expected to hear the sound of an explosion, but heard nothing and called my husband who told me to call 911 immediately. ((NUFORC Note:  Event occurred at 20:21::52 hrs. (Pacific Daylight Time), as reported by Mr. Ed Majden, astronomer, Courtenay, B.C..   We have changed the time above.

As my son and I were getting out of my car at Wal-Mart in Port Orchard I glanced up at the sky and noticed an object floating/drifting;2004-05-22 20:00:00;3 minutes;As my son and I were getting out of my car at Wal-Mart in Port Orchard I glanced up at the sky and noticed an object floating/drifting in the sky it acted much like a balloon except it did not gain altitude like a released helium balloon, it maintained a level course. The object had a black non-reflective bottom and a light reflective top. It appeared to be about half the size of the full moon to as it got closer, about three fourths the size of the full moon. It was still very light out so we got a good look at it. It appeared to wobble very slightly. It floated/drifted in a roughly southeasterly direction. We also heard no noise from the object.;47.5111679104479;-122.603735074627

Solid light  very high in sky. Then dissappeared.;2007-03-05 19:25:00;15 minutes;Solid light  very high in sky. Then dissappeared. Bright red light.  Moving very slowly across the sky.  Steady light, not a blinking light.  Object stopped moving and was still for a minimum of 5 minutes.  Then dissappeared.   We were able to get photos of the object, but was very far away and we were not able to distinguish details of the object like size or shape...   We have seen a few helicoptors circling the area after the object dissappeared.  No real indicators of a normal aircraft like noise, blinking lights, trails, or a change in orientation of the light.
