Silent, fast moving, extremely bright  orb crossed in front of the moon.;2006-08-13 05:00:00;60 seconds;Silent, fast moving, extremely bright  orb crossed in front of the moon. This UFO made no noise, left no vapor trail, was as bright as Venus which I also saw rising in the east.  It came from NNW headed ESE as it crossed in front of the moon.  I watched this for about 60 seconds and I couldn't see it anymore.  It was moving as fast as a commercial jet would move but a jet would make noise and wouldn't be that bright.  It was like a spotlight, very bright, as bright as the moon.  I also spotted a conventional aircraft moving in a parallel path to the object but about 30 degrees distant.  The plane was obviously a plane and the UFO was obviously NOT a plane.;46.3125;-119.3717
