The day started with plans of leaving after school was out for the kids my wife was done with work for the day and I was at home getting everything ready for the trip, listening to music I was getting goose bummps on my left sholder  consintrated  in one spacific area, this  part of my sholder had a ingrown hair that I was cleaning with a straight pin that might have gotten infected, long storie short, I belive that many of the incounters found today may be closer to home then we all belive in fact the right under our very skin or bone maybe some of the sightings are that of a dentists drill or doctors scalple, or a rescraped knee this is just my opnion thanx ps the sound that it made was a scream ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.
