One below the belt of orion and the other to my right which appeared to be a planet. Then I saw a metallic craft pass across the sky right infront of me without any sort of illumination. I coudn't quite see an exact formation, but I did notice the head of the craft was rounded but the rest just seemed to blend into the sky. This craft disappeared within 6 seconds and the other two lights remained in their position of the constellation without further movement.;46.3125;-119.3717
