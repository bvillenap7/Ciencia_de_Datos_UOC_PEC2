Young man and girlfriend witness an intensely bright object streak across the night sky, followed by a second object.;1994-03-08 19:15:00;5 seconds;Young man and girlfriend witness an intensely bright object streak across the night sky, followed by a second identical object. On this particular date, Tuesday, March 08, 1994, I decided to drop by the Last Exit on Brooklyn coffee house, where I was a frequent denizen and patron. When I entered the establishment, a male patron there, whom I knew well by that time, hailed me over to his table, stating that he wanted to tell me something unusual.  He was surprisingly animated, and seemed quite excited by what it was that had just happened to him and his girlfriend. The two of them proceeded to describe how they had been walking north on the east side of University Avenue, and just south of NE 50th, when they witnessed an intensely bright fireball streaking across the night sky, at approximately 7:15 (??) p.m. (Pacific).  They witnessed the object, which was as bright as a welder's torch, streak across the clear night sky, make several abrupt, almost instantaneous, turns, and then streak to the east, or southeast, disappearing from their view behind a building. A moment later, they witnessed a second, identical, object performe a similar maneuver across the sky, and apparently follow approximately the flight path of the first object. I am certain of the date of the event, but I am uncertain as to the exact time of the sighting. The male witness to this event was interviewed by an ABC news camera team in January 2005, and he appears in the ABC special, entitled UFO's:  Seeing is Believing.  I consider the witness to be highly credible, and the incident was reported to me perhaps within minutes of its occurrence. Neither of the two witnesses was aware of the dramatic sighting that occurred that same night over Lake Michigan, and perhaps at approximately the same time as the sighting over the University District in Seattle. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Peter Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting Center, on behalf of the witnesses.  Also, this event occurred at the same time that a Michigan State Patrol Officer was witnessing a cluster of unidentified objects over Lake Michigan, as they were also being observed on weather radar by a radar operator at a U. S. National Weather Service station.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

The fireball was moving to the west, and disappeared over a hill to my right. The object looked like a green fireball, with a long tail. I was travelling home on the freeway named above, and looked up just in time to see this green fireball.  I thought it was strange, since it was big enough to be very close, yet it did not die out, like fireworks would do.  It just kept moving towards the west, and then disappeared over the hill on my right (out of view).  There was one other person with me in the car, but that person was talking and did not see it.  It did not give it any more thought, until I turned on the Art Bell show, and heard a lady in Seattle call in and describe the very thing that I had just seen. I know the time was right about 9:10pm, because I had just left a store in the University District, and the travel time to the point of observation was about ten minutes.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

single very bright light green colored fireball traverses 40 degrees of the sky on south, downward-slanted trajectory, moved quite fast;1999-01-05 05:31:00;1 sec;single very bright light green colored fireball traverses 40 degrees of the sky on south, downward-slanted trajectory, moved quite fast, but slower than meteors.  Unusual shade of green.  Object below fairly high broken overcast. At 0631 Hrs PST today, as I was traveling south on I-5 (in the Shoreline area), I observed a single very bright light green colored object traverse about 40 degrees of the sky.  The object  became visible to me as it came out from behind the roof of my car and hence became visible through the windshield.  It was traveling southward at what appeared to be a straight, downward course.  A rough estimate would be 20-30 deg below the horizontal. This clear very bight object moved quite fast, but slower than meteors I've observed in the past.  neither have I seen anything quite this shade of green, although I have seen green fireballs or meteors before.  A fairly high broken overcast was made obvious by the Moon, and I believe this green object to have been below that overcast.  I did observe the normal air traffic in the sky such as airliners approaching Sea-Tac and traffic helicopter, etc.  These all were below the overcast.  When the green light from the object went out, it went out as often described: like a lightbulb being turned off. The things that distinguish this sighting in my mind are the clarity and exceptional brightness of the light from this object, the fact that it did not appear as a 'streak' as other meteors I have seen did, but appeared as a clear, very bright object  (no discernable diameter), and that it seemingly was quite close tot he ground, - a couple of thousand feet at the most I would guess, (based on the cloud cover) and the sense was that it was quite lower than that.  And that it did not smear in my vision, but remained a clear single source of light with no trail, and that it moved at a speed that I preceived to be faster than aircraft, but slower than other meteors I've observed. While I expect that what I saw was a meteor, and believe what I saw to be within the normal range of behaviors for such objects, it was nonetheless an unusual sight.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Myself and another person was standing on the passenger side on the car facing East, with the other person standing on the drivers side of the car, faced West. We were out on the street, for approximatly 10 minutes.  I remember the sky being clear enough to see the stars and the approaching planes at near by Boeing Field.  As we were finishing up our conversation, the person on the drivers side of the car, looked up and pointed over our shoulders and said look.  We turned and saw a BRIGHT, ROUND, REDISH, ORANGE, UNFAMILIAR FLYING OBJECT, flying from West to East, fairly low.  It traveled in that direction for approx. a few seconds and then made a turn and started to travel in a NorthEastern direction.  It traveled N.E. for a few more seconds, we could clearly see it traveling across the sky, at that point I told the guys it was only a meteor falling from the sky, At that monment the craft made another sudden turn due North and increased speed and zipped away very, very fast.  One of the guys started running down the block to keep it in eyesight, but it faded out of view, as it flew away.  I made the comment that what ever it was, it could have easily have crossed the state within a minutes time, thats how fast it appeared to fly away. As an Ex-Navy Aviation Operations Yeoman, I've seen various types of military Aircraft, including the F/A-18 and others.  For those planes to travel at their highest rate of speed, theres always an after blast/Sonic Boom.  This object travel much, much faster, made impossible turns and theres was no sound.

In the wee hours of July 3rd I saw a giant red fireball fall slowly over the north of Puget Sound.;2001-07-03 02:10:00;15 seconds;In the wee hours of July 3rd I saw a giant red fireball fall slowly over the north of Puget Sound. I am an employee of a major hospital in Seattle Washington, and I work the graveyard shift.  I was on my break this morning, on the 6th floor of the hospital on Capitol Hill.  The lounge on the 6th floor has a commanding view looking westward, toward Puget Sound.  The skies were clear, there was no precipitation.  I was sitting on a couch in the lounge reading when out of the corner of my eye I saw something big, red and moving.  Looking out the window I saw a very large RED FIREBALL descending rather slowly, apparently over the north Sound area.  It was quite large, appearing to be nearly half the size of the almost-full moon.  It was extremely bright, a glaring reddish-pink in color.  It was definitely burning as it fell, not sparkling or hazy, no diminishment in size as it arced downward through the sky.  I watched it as it went behind the 3 radio towers located atop Queen Anne hill - I could clearly see the framework of the towers illuminated from behind as the fireball descended behind them.  It then fell out of sight behind Queen Anne hill itself.  There were no bits of debris of any sort that flew off the fireball as it fell, no ejecta, just a BIG red ball lazily falling through the night sky.  I was miles away, and this thing, whatever it was, was huge.  Needless to say, I have no idea what it was I saw.

On the corner of 55th and Genesee there is a lookout that looks toward Vashon Island. My father lives just below the KOMO radio towers, on Vashon, on the beach at Glen Acres. On this particular morning I noticed what appeared to be a bright fire on the beach near the location of his home. It was large enough that, from this distance, it looked to encompass an entire block of houses. I watched it for about 20 seconds before I continued through the turn to the East. It was still there as I cleared the next block and didn't disappear until I reached the next viewable location to the East. It was obvious, from the level of illumination, that the people who lived on the beach near Glen Acres had to have been awakened by the light. It was brilliant orange / yellow and the sun was still at a low elevation.  On Saturday, February 14th, I decided to call my father to determine if he had seen anything. To my surprise he was already excited with information that he was trying to relate along the same line.  This conversation occured at approximately 11:20 am. What he described was an unusual zig-zag contrail that traveled from above his house to a location near Snoqualmie Pass.  He was quite enthralled with the unique nature of the contrail as it didn't resemble anything he has seen in the past.  This was observed at or near sun-up on the morning of February 14th above Vashon Island's East side.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Flaming ball moves slow and turns on a dime;2008-11-15 18:20:00;25-30 minutes;flaming ball moves slow and turns on a dime About 6:20 PM, Saturday Nov. 15, 2008 I walked out onto my porch to have a cigarette. While I was lighting it I looked up and saw a dark area with an immensely large orange light towards its rear. I thought wow, that plane has HUGE lights and continued my smoking. While I watched it slowly move eastward (my porch faces south) something didn't seem quite right as the orange glow was Way too large and a plane would have not taken that long to travel such a short distance as it had. If I had to guess general location, I would say coming from the west, south of Bremerton but north of Tacoma in a straight path eastward. So I went inside, told my husband that something just isn't right with this thing I've been watching, it looks like its on fire, and pulled out the binoculars. As I focused in for a closer look, my husband came out to see what i was talking about. The plane/dark object indeed seemed to have the entire tail end of it encased in an orange flaming mass (round mass, mind you.. there were no tendrils or trails.. more like liquid fire contained in a glass ball). I handed the binoculars to my husband who took a long look as well. I thought maybe I should call the airport, then thought that they would probably have a dead-on view of it anyway. We sat and watched it continue eastward .. it seemed to slow and then just 'hang' in the sky for about 10 seconds before heading straight south.  It did not turn south, it ended its eastward movement and began its southward movement (the phrase 'turn on a dime' comes to mind). If I held my arms out in front of me with one finger at the point where I first notice this object and the other where the eastward movement terminated.. it measures a measly 15-16 inches between. Thus far it has been a good 20 minutes. The southward movement was faster than the eastward. It seemed it would pass directly over Tacoma, the bright ball getting somewhat smaller as it went. When it looked as though it was flying over the Centralia/Chehalis area, the fire went out but I could barely make out a dark grey/black dot which seemed to descend rapidly for a second before I couldn't see it anymore. I don't know if anyone else saw this... but I'm sure someone had to have seen it. I contacted King 5 news via their tip line.. but never heard anything.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Bright hot object leaving trail over Seattle in early morning of December 2nd, 2009;2009-12-02 03:24:00;5-10 seconds;Bright hot object leaving trail over Seattle in early morning of December 2nd, 2009 I am quite used to seeing planes coming in from the north low in the sky as they prepare to descend onto the Sea-Tac airport, flying by on frequency of maybe one or two every thirty minutes. Their lights catch my attention but are usually no brighter than passing headlights on the highway. From my eastern facing position they cruise across my view from north to south. However Last night at exactly 3:24 a.m. the sky lit up from an object streaking across the sky from west to east. It was moving at a considerable pace and was quite different than the objects I am used to seeing out this window. If you can say that the sun in the sky is about the size of a quarter were you to hold one up in the air, this object was about the size of a lentil bean in that perspective. Unlike the lights of the planes which have a cool value to their hue this object was warm and bright like an arc weld almost too bright to look at. This brightness caused a halo effect around the object which tapered off into a streaking tail which dithered behind it. When I say this object was bright I mean that it lit up the sky and the buildings in first hill. It was bright enough to illuminate the facing walls of the taller buildings, the roofs as it passed over head and to silhouette the buildings as it passed to their opposite sides. The brightness was enough to catch my attention away from my computer screen and I had just enough time to stand up in disbelief and watch it cruise past the buildings as stated heading east. The angle of entry was more level with the horizon than steep otherwise I am convinced it would have hit the tallest building in my view. Of course that is dependent on my relative position and perspective to the event, I actually do not know how high or how big this object actually was though I relate here to you my best account of what I viewed. It was enough though to scare my cat out of the window and into hiding. The event lasted 5 to 10 seconds I estimate and I did not have time to photograph the event. I make no assumptions as to what I saw.

July 3, 2010 sighting over Seattle,WA;2010-07-03 20:00:00;15 sec;July 3, 2010 sighting over Seattle,WA I was enjoying the beautiful clear night whith five family members, from the rooftop lounging area of Inn At The Market, on July 3, 2010.  The veiw over Puget Sound was amazing.  Just after sunset, yet not quite dusk, I noticed a brite yellow-white fireball streaking across the sky from the direction of the space needle toward the south west.  I know this was not a plane, it was too fast, and strobes were absent.   I also know it was not a sattleite, because it was too fast.  It's size was too large to be a hellicopter yet too small to be a plane.  It was missing wings and/or rotar.   The other thing that sets it apart is it was silent.  There were no fireworks going in the area muchl ess in that direction at that time.  The height in the air that it was flying was equivalent to that of plane not preparing to land. This fireball object was moving way slower than a meteor/falling star.  I am reporting this because I couldn't identify it, even with a military background.   I am truly stunned.  I will not forget it..  This is my second sighting in my life.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Fireballs over night sky in Seattle.;2010-07-17 11:20:00;15 minutes;Fireballs over nightsky in Seattle Over the period of about 15 minutes we watched a succession of about 13 orange fireballs ascend from the direction of West Seattle high into the night sky and then go out.  There was no sound. Shortly after the last fireball dissapeared, we witnessed 3 of these balls slowly drift back toward the earth into my neighborhood which is Mount Baker Seattle.  Unfortunately, we were not able to see where they finally touched down.  As they were coming down they drifted lightly, reminding us of a plastic bag drifting through the wind.  Also reminded me of those camping lamps they used to make with the netting that would burn out.  Strange, seemed manmade once they came down, but I don't understand how they went up so high so quickly and they were quite large....

Three orange lights over northeast Seattle;2011-02-02 21:30:00;2 minutes;Three orange lights over northeast Seattle We were leaving a residence in northeast Seattle in the Wedgewood area, not far from Lake Washington at about 9:30 pm on February 2, 2011.   My son saw the lights first and pointed them out to my daughter and me.  He was facing north and we were looking at about a 45 degree angle up into the sky.  It was partly cloudy and we were looking at a break in the clouds.  There were three bright orange or amber lights in an obtuse triangular shape.  None of the sides of the triangle were even.   The objects didn’t seem to be going anywhere but there was some movement as if they were hovering.  There was no sound.  They disappeared one by one.  We weren’t certain if they went behind the clouds or went out altogether. I would describe these lights as fireballs that appeared larger and brighter than stars and planets and they gave the appearance of being relatively close, as if they were within the atmosphere.   I’ve never seen anything like them before.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

While in conversation my friend began yelling for me to look in the direction behind me.  He then ran across the parking lot yelling, Oh my god and I ran after him looking in the sky only to see a red tail of what a comet may look like falling from the West to an Eastward direction and it soon disappeared over the horizon of the city. It is a fairly clear night with only a few swiffs of clouds.  Tonight the moon and stars can be seen easily past the city lights.  The tail end of what I saw was vivid. My friend described a green fire ball that streaked across the sky changing to the color red. Approx 1 min later after walking back to where we we're standing and looking in the direction it was traveling we saw a quick flash of bright light above the tree line.  The impact had to be several miles away East of Seattle.  My best guess would be anywhere from Mercer Island to maybe Issaquah, WA ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor?  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Glowing orange orb flying North to South across Lake Washington 10/31/2011;2011-10-31 19:15:00;2 minutes;Glowing orange orb flying North to South across Lake Washington 10/31/2011 Dear Sir, I write to report the sighting of a flying  object that I was not able to identify on the evening of October 31st, 2011.  It was approximately 7:15 p.m. and I stepped out to get a breath of fresh air.  My deck faces East towards Lake Washington from Lake City Seattle. Upon having my attention directed to an orange object in the sky by my wife I observed a glowing orange orb moving from North to South across the sky at a high rate of speed over Lake Washington.  There were no flashing lights on the object and it was moving steadily at a rapid  speed across the horizon.  The object did not change direction and I observed it steadily for approximately 30 seconds until it disappeared behind the large trees in our yard. I would say that from the skyline the glowing orange orb was at an approximate angle of 40 degrees from tree line.  My best estimate at the size of the object would be that it was roughly 1/4th the size of a large full moon, or roughly as large as my thumbnail with my arm fully extended towards the sky.  The object did not emit a detectable sound. It is worth noting that about 15-20 minutes later an airplane flew directly overhead from moving from West to East.  Comparatively, the airplane was moving at a much slower speed. Later that evening I once again stepped out on the deck and was observing the sky due to the earlier occurrence.  Curiously, I spotted a similar looking object in the Southern sky.  This time the movement pattern was much different.  The object was much higher (roughly 75-80 degrees from tree line) and appeared to be much further away.  Still, the object was approximately two to four times larger than any star or planet in the sky.  This time the glowing orange orb was moving much slower and was zig-zagging East to West as it continued moving South.  My second observation lasted approximately 2-3 minutes until the object again moved behind tall trees that at last obscured my view.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Reddish/Orange light seen over Seattle, WA;2011-11-14 20:05:00;<1 minute;Reddish/Orange light seen over Seattle, WA 11/14/11 at 20:05, reporting from Seattle, Washington.  Observed was a reddish/orange light approaching from the East. The light appeared to be moving fast over the Capital Hill/First Hill neighborhood and may have been 1000 to 2000 ft in elevation.   As the light approached closer it appeared to slow down and seemed very large.  The light started to shift towards the north and appeared to get smaller.  It appeared to climb in elevation and started moving at a faster rate. The light disappeared and there was a flash of light that lasted a millisecond. The normal route for air traffic to Sea-Tac International Airport was an approach from the North to the South.  This object approached from the East and curved to the North, cutting through the normal flight pattern. The sky was dark and partly cloudy and some stars were observed.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
3 orange orbs or fireballs fly in formation over Seattle (Capitol Hill/Madison Valley) on December 26, 2011 at around 2:17 AM.;2011-12-26 02:17:00;3 minutes;3 orange orbs or fireballs fly in formation over Seattle (Capitol Hill/Madison Valley) on December 26, 2011 at around 2:17 AM. Last night, as I was walking the dog, I noticed a single orange light coming towards me from the southwest and traveling overhead to the northeastern part of the sky.  At first I thought it was some kind of low flying plane or helicopter, but it was fuzzy in appearance and flaring outward in all directions. It moved slowly. Soon afterwards it flew directly over me, and behind the cloud deck off to the northeast. Next about 20 seconds later, I saw two more orange lights traveling in formation, heading on the same course as the first object.  The two objects appeared from the same direction, same course, same speed, and same altitude, flying in a single file pattern. As I tried to get a closer look at them, I noticed that each was a fuzzy, glowing, light orange ball or orb. They did not appear to have any solid noticeable center, and their outlines were faint and semitransparent (almost halo-like). These objects made no sound at all, had no beacons or flashing! lights on them, and just seemed to float along. Their speed would be equivalent to a small plane or helicopter. They were not moving very fast. But these lights were definitely not aircraft. I have no idea how large they may have been or how far away they actually were. What is interesting is that when the objects were directly overhead, I noticed a slight wobble and floating movement (strange propulsion), in which one of objects moved slightly away from the other one, slowing down for a moment and then speeding up again to meet back in formation with the other object.  After a few seconds they continued to travel at the same speed towards the northeast.  My thoughts were that these two strange orange orbs were following, or catching up with the first orange orb.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

The object at first looked like it was something on fire, a balloon or plane, but there were no other lights, No flashing, object made no noise. It took about 2 minutes to fly accross the sky.  It was at one point close to being directly underneath us.  Never seen anything like it. If it was a meteor it would have been announce by Nasa as a near miss to earth.  This was not a meteor. I don't know what it was.  There was also a quick flash of light across the sky at one point. I do not know if this was connected to the object.  It may have been lightning, then 10 seconds later rumbling/boom like sonic boom or thunder, but the sky was partially clear.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Multiple glowing objects flying South down Puget Sound;2012-07-04 22:00:00;30 minutes;Multiple glowing objects flying South down Puget Sound I live in West Seattle about 1/4 mile South of the Fauntleroy ferry dock. About 9:30PM last night two friends and I went up on my roof and sat in chairs facing West, giving us a sweeping view of Puget Sound, Vashon, Baimbridge and Blake islands and the Olympic mountains. It was twilight, and there were multiple fireworks going off both on our side of the Sound and across on the islands. Suddenly all three of us noticed two bright reddish orange lights flying southward, in tandem, down the Sound. I would estimate that they were at 5,000 feet altitude, flying slightly faster than a jet, maintaining equal distance from one another, and completely silent.  They were about the size of a large jet, but were just glowing lights, with no visible structure.  As they flew over the North tip of Vashon Island, they both appeared to slow down, and the one that was slightly ahead began to dim.  They continued on their course until we could no longer see them (behind some trees in my yard).  We were amazed and were discussing what they possibly could have been when another light, this time solo, followed the exact same path down the sound. At this point, I ran down to grab some high powered binoculars, and within a few minutes another light followed in the same path as the prior three.  This time I was able to get a much closer look, focusing in on it with the binoculars.  It l ooked like a fireball, with a red glow behind it.  This one too slowed and dimmed but never fully faded.  Over the course of the next half hour, five more of these lights came down the sound.  We saw one jet, flying Northwesterly from Seatac airport, clearly make a large turn to avoid the passing light. I cannot stress enough that these lights were no part of the fireworks displays.  They were much higher in the sky, and we had a clear view of each one for at least 30 seconds as it flew from North to South.  Even though the main firework event was going on 10 miles North of us over Lake Union in Seattle, Im sure there were thousands of people watching fireworks over Puget Sound and it would have been impossible to miss these lights traveling down the sound. I thought there would be a story about it on the news this morning, but I didnt hear a word about it.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Multiple fireballs seen over North Seattle;2012-07-07 23:00:00;3-5 minutes;Multiple &quotfireballs&quot seen over North Seattle I was heading to the grocery store and approximately four blocks before I arrived at my destination, approximately three large orange lights caught my attention. At first glance they appeared to be street lights, but I knew right away that based on the location of the lights the source was absolutely something aerial as they were far too high in the air, and too far from any road to be street lights. I then saw another set of lights fly over Holman road, from north to south, as I pulled into the parking lot of the store. I immediately parked my car and got out to get a better look. At this time I realized that there were at least 10 of these lights, in no particular formation, flying southward into the night sky.  They did not appear to be ascending or descending. One of them hovered momentarily above me, long enough for me to attempt to get my phone out. Of course, my phone battery was completely drained of battery life.  Instead I gazed at this thing, taking mental notes of it’s dark orange center that blended in a gradient to a dark red around the circumference.  It appeared to have some kind of texture on the orange portion that is hard to pinpoint or describe in a way that does it justice.... it almost looked like it was organic, for lack of a better term. Like the surface of the sun almost. It just appeared to have some kind of motion and energy to it. It was fuzzy, like I just couldn’t quite make out fine details on it. At this point, a fellow witness drove up toward me in a late model camaro (or possibly trans-am / firebird / i-roc - early to mid 80’s model in great condition) and stopped her car. She asked me excitedly if I could see them too. I informed her I could of course, and she got out of her car to watch them with me. She got out of her car just in time to see the last one disappear from site. It was not clear whether these myseterious lights faded out due to distance or due to their light source slowly being extinguished. The only thing I could compare these to would be Chinese lanterns, but that doesn’t feel right.  They were, at least from my perspective, too large to be Chinese lanterns, and too perfectly round. Plus the lighting was so perfect....almost unreal.  It was so even over the surface of the sphere it almost looked matte.  The lights were not extremely bright, they were actually quite dull, as if they were just bright enough to illuminate the body of these objects. I can say they were definitely NOT fireworks of any kind, as they were visible far too long and moved way too slowly.  I can say they were not standard aircraft because they did not make any audible sound and did not have the standard FAA required lights flashing anywhere on them. That’s it.  They disappeared and I’m in awe.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Looking North  Time: 11:40 PM PST  It was a perfectly clear and still Seattle night without a cloud in the sky or a breeze and a very bright moon.  As I got out of my car I observed 6 reddish/orange fireball type orbs in a formation looking to the north from the top of Magnolia as I stood by my car on the sidewalk.  They were just above the tree elevation on the horizon of the sky at first.  They were solid reddish/orange lists and were not blinking. They were north of my location in Magnolia. The appeared to be in a formation with fairly equal spacing between them.  They were totally silent and appeared to be slowly moving south towards me from the north.  They appeared to be at 5000 feet or so and then they started elevating from there to the north of Magnolia. It was difficult to judge the exact elevation they were however.  It appeared to be about the same height that a low plane would be. When I first noticed them, at first I thought they were just the blinking red lights on the radio towers on the top of Queen Anne Hill as they were at about that height in the sky. I then looked to my east and observed the Queen Anne blinking red radio tower lights and quickly realized that these reddish/orange fireball orbs were something totally different than the Queen Anne radio tower lights as they were to the north and there are no radio towers to the north of my location on Magnolia. These orbs were different as they were not blinking and were a solid reddish/orange color and they were moving. I observed these orbs for approximately 10 mins as they slowly came north from the south and slowly elevated from their original elevation keeping in formation. One orb after the other elevated (one at a time)to a certain elevation point in the sky maybe 10,000 feet closer to my location than at first. When each one got to the same higher elevation point in the sky each one of them disappeared at about the same point in the sky (one by one) until they had all disappeared by 11:50 PM PST. They made ! no sound. Normally in Magnolia there is lots of plane air traf! fic that I observe from this vantage point of planes taking off and landing as they fly over the city of Seattle in approach for landing or after takeoff from SeaTac Airport to the south as this location I was at in Magnolia is right over the flight path to the SeaTac airport from the north. I made a point to look around in every direction while I was viewing the orbs looking for air traffic and there were no planes that I observed during this 10 minute sighting while the orbs were present. This was very strange as it is very normal to hear and see planes flying over this location in Magnolia all the time. I noticed that no sooner as soon as the last orb had disappeared above me that I saw and heard several airplanes fly over the area as was normal. It was as if the orbs saw the planes coming and disappeared just before they arrived.  I am a 43 year old Regional Manager for a HR Software Company. I have had three jobs in 20 years out of college. My mother has lived in Magnolia for 20 years and I stay with her frequently and no the area well and the air traffic patterns of planes in the area. These orbs were not planes or helicopters as they were solid lights, moved slow in a formation, and were totally silent. They were not flares either because flares come down and these orbs were going up and keeping in formation. I have never seen anything like them before.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Lone Fireball flew over my apartment, zig-zagged, changed colors, flew off(?);2012-08-10 02:00:00;2 minutes;Lone Fireball flew over my apartment, zig-zagged, changed colors, flew off(?) For the second time now since July 7th, I have had another sighting of one of these things.  Last time I saw upwards of a dozen of these things fly over a grocery store. Last night/early this AM my girlfriend and I were standing on our balcony at 2am, gazing up at the night sky. We'd seen a shooting star (no question in my mind) moments before this and a jet was creeping by off in the distance (no doubt again - could hear it and familiar with the light patterns on airliners).  Then, we saw one of these fireballs. I saw it first and gasped. Pointed up at the sky, said &quotHONEY LOOK HOLY S* THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I SAW!&quot She watched it as I ran inside to grab something with a camera on it. It had come from behind us, flying over the top of our building at what appeared to be a relatively low altitude.  I started to capture video the best I could on my iPod touch...which isn't much obviously. Not a great video but I wanted to document it SOMEHOW for my! self mainly. Here's the strange thing....before I had a very difficult time describing just how odd this thing looked. This time I paid attention to every detail knowing that is what NUFORC needs. Luckily, on this occasion the thing made very erratic movements after coming in a north to south direction over our apartment complex. It did a sort of subtle zig-zag movement a few times, then glided into a change of direction to the left (East) in a motion that can only be described as perfectly organic. Ballerina like, very graceful and smooth.  At times it seemed to produce a bit of a red trail. It did change color dramatically unlike the last ones I saw. This time it started out BRIGHT yellow, almost white, faded to a blood red, then back to near white again. No real pattern to the changes that I could discern. Luckily my crappy video does at least show evidence of this to some degree, though not to the same degree as to the naked eye. OK here's the really strange thing... It had this..vibration to it. I don't mean that in some spiritual way or metaphysical pseudo-scientific sense....Imagine the way a guitar string looks when it's plucked. Sitting motionless, you can see a guitar string perfectly without interference or distortion. Now if you *pluck* a guitar string, causing it to vibrate and  produce sound, you can still see it. It still maintains it's same general shape (a metallic line in the string's case) but it is moving so rapidly that it appears distorted. It gets blurry, sort of elongated at times, or wider at others, but in the center where it normally rests you can still see a basic ghost of it's shape and details.... It's definitely there, but your eyes can't keep up with it. That's what this thing appeared like. It was definitely round, but there was this weird fuzziness to it that was not caused by distance or lack of efficient eyesight. There was some kind of....other wordly or at least odd and very rapid motion to this thing....that's what I mean when I say it was &quotvibrating&quot. Anyway, it went left, going behind a tree, where I could still see it a bit with my naked eyes.  It sat there for a good minute at least, and eventually just was not there when I looked up again. Definitely not a chinese lantern. I actually had set one off into the night after the experience I had on the 7th of July just to try to see if it in fact was what I had seen. I can unequivocally state it was not a chinese lantern. I at some point felt electric, the way you do before a lightning storm. I checked the weather report for today on the NOAA site, and at that time it looks like the wind was blowing in a Northern direction at about 5mph, max of 8.....but north is the exact opposite direction this thing was going. I may upload the video but am hesitant to. It is not good quality, and on top of that I am audibly shaken up by what I'm seeing and sound like a scared little girl or something so it's kind of embarrassing. ALTHOUGH.....I am a video professional by trade so in an attempt to clean up the crap video a bit and enhance it to get a better look at this thing..... I found something positively EERIE. Right before I stopped taping,  something that appears to be a &quotgray alien&quot face takes over the left side of the frame.  Note this only happens when I process the video to increase contrast and boost GAIN levels, which can cause distortion if done inappropriately.   In my opinion I don't think if grays exist, they have anything to do with fireballs or really care to associate with us, but it is definitely maybe worth noting.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

White/orange orb seen near Golden Gardens, Seattle;2013-03-09 01:08:00;3 minutes;white/orange orb seen near Golden Gardens, Seattle At 0108 I noticed a beach ball size fire ball about 150 feet high, almost right above me, slowly moving in random directions.  The ball was white in color then started to change to orange. Once it changed to a bright orange it streaked straight up and out of vision, in a blink of an eye it was gone.  There was no sound;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Two fireballs above West Seattle.;2013-08-28 20:45:00;5 minutes;Two fireballs above West Seattle I was talking on the phone to my daughter and looked out the window facing north.  There were 2 fireballs, moving slowly to the east.  I could see like a fire or flames in these objects which appeared to be egg shaped.   There were planes in the sky as they approached Seatac in Seattle.  These objects appeared to be at about the same level as planes that were making the approach to land.   I am not good at estimating the number of feet, but maybe about 2000 feet in the air. I am an older woman and have been a nurse for a long time.  My only other observation was about 35 years ago in Montana when a flying object followed us. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to a previous report of fireballs This is an addendum to an earlier report I made from West Seattle.  The 2 fireballs I saw went behind some clouds, at first one and then the other eventually, and both never came out from behind the clouds.  The clouds were thin and it seems like they should have reappeared, but didn't. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite serious, and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a very good witness.

Small orange fireball type object fell to the pavement on Alkai Beach area;2013-09-14 20:00:00;5 minutes?;Small orange fireball type object fell to the pavement on Alkai Beach area A group of orange fireballs were seen coming across Elliot Bay from Madrona south to Alkai Point.  One landed on the pavement in front of a group of people waiting to cross the street.  The object resembled a miniature hot air balloon with about a two foot diameter canvas type cloth parachute and below it was suspendered a triangular platform on which was in an incindiary device that had burned out.   A woman in the group identified herself as working for the police department and took the object.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Two fiery objects high in the sky before fireworks display.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;5 minutes;Seattle, east shore of Lake Union. Two fiery objects high in the sky before fireworks display. Neighbors gathered to see the fireworks display saw a fiery object high in the southwest sky and streaking toward the north.  First we thought it was a flare but it was much higher than a marine flare would be.  Some one speculated it could be space debris.  As it streaked downward 2 fiery tails came straight down and appeared to burn out before reaching the ground. A few minutes later we noted a fiery orange object high in the sky sky to the west.  It hovered at the same height for 1-2 minutes and then flew to the south at a constant height.  It no longer appeared fiery as it disappeared from view. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello, Peter, I listened to your appearance on the Jeff Rense program when you had guests on who saw the events before the Seattle fireworks on July 4, 2014.  My report is the one above.  I live in the Eastlake neighborhood, of Seattle, 1-1/2 blocks from Lake Union, in a condo.  We have a roof deck above the 3rd floor of the condo where we watch the fireworks every 4th of July. One of your guests seemed to think there was something ominous about the military helicopter carrying the American flag.  That has been a part of the Lake Union fireworks show for about 26 years, as long as I’ve lived on the east shore of Lake Union.  When they first started the show years ago they had searchlights all around the lake to track the helicopter with flag.  But as budgets grew smaller, they went to the military helicopter with a light on the flag, which does not show off the flag as well as the searchlights did.  The helicopter always comes from the north, flies over Gas Works Park (where there is a big daylong event), and then flies around the lake shore before going back north. After I made the above report, I looked online to see if there were any reports about the events I saw.  The first object I saw was a white light streaking, like a shooting star or meteor.  But it suddenly broke into 2 tails that went directly down to the water.  Online I found information that skydivers were supposed to jump into the lake, wearing sparklers on their feet, and the promotional material said it would look like a meteor.  I could not find any news items that said the skydivers completed that dive, although I know skydivers landed at Gas Works Park in an earlier skydive as planned.  I don’t know if that is the explanation for what I saw. I find it hard to believe that sparklers could be that bright. The other object I saw was a fiery, flaming thing. It was orange-red, like when you see a car burst into flames in the movies, as if fueled by gasoline or other accelerant. First I thought it might be a sky lantern, because I frequently see sky lanterns launched from that area - North Queen Anne Hill, in the vicinity of the Lake Washington Ship Canal.  But the flames were so big and bright I did not think a sky lantern could have that much fuel. My next thought was it could be an aircraft on fire, but then it would have crashed. Instead, the flames disappeared.  Then from that location in the sky I saw a steady blue light moving across the sky, I estimate at the same height an airliner at cruising altitude would be, and in about the same location as I often see aircraft.  But the light was steady blue, not flashing, and no other lights were visible.  This light maintained a constant speed from north to south (as I looked toward the west), and I saw it go behind a cloud and then reappear until it disappeared from my view.  Here’s what I found on one online description of the skydivers: Skydivers If you're going to Gasworks Park for the 4th of July celebration, fireworks won't be the only things in the sky you'll be seeing. Skydivers from Shelton company Skydive Kapowsin will be jumping into the Gasworks Park area twice as part of the fireworks show. The first jump will be into the Gasworks Park crowd at 7:30 p.m., while the second jump at 10:10 p.m. will be into the water at Lake Union. The second jump will feature skydivers wearing wingsuits with lights on them, so look for their bright lights to be screeching across Lake Union. ____________________________________________________________________________________ I’m not sure if this makes things more clear or more confusing, but I realized I hadn’t mentioned the blue light before. Thanks,;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
New Year's Eve lanterns/fireballs?;2014-12-31 21:00:00;30+ minutes;New Year's Eve lanterns/fireballs? Saw around 10 or more round lights drifting from east to west in the southern sky at different angles in the horizon, from about 30 to 70 degrees.  Some seemed allot closer then others.   The first set of three I noticed were very large in the sky.  They appeared out of nowhere and disappeared without any speed or movement.  There was no noise, smell, contrail, or erratic movement.   They usually appeared in groups of three and spread out over the horizon in a triangle formation, although they did not keep a tight triangle formation.  They didn't flicker, and the colors were fairly constant.  I assumed that they were lanterns, but they seem too bright and too round.  But their movement and disappearance would be consistent with lanterns.  It was also new years eve which makes me think they are lanterns.   The appeared and disappeared for around 20 minutes to a half and hour.  On viewing the video #1750, I noticed a second light or lights above the lantern.  This light can be viewed on at the 8 to 10 second part.  It is directly above the lantern and appears and disappears and changes color from red to blue to white.

1-2 orange fireball objects in the sky.;2015-01-01 00:10:00;25 minutes;1-2 orange fireball objects in the sky At 12:10 AM, I looked out the window to watch the local territorial New Year’s fireworks. The night sky was clear of haze or clouds, which is unusual for our area this time of year.  High in the sky (much higher than the city fireworks displays), I saw a bright orange round ‘fireball’.   The object looked unusual to me, so I grabbed my 50x binoculars to get a closer look. Watching through the binoculars, I could see that the fireball was slowly moving from east to west.   After a few minutes, a commercial airplane flew from west to east, lower in the sky than the object, perhaps originating from SeaTac airport.  As the airplane neared the fireball vertically, the orange fireball light went out, but I could see the faint circular or oval shape of the object since I had been tracking it through the binoculars.   After a minute or two the outline became fainter and I lost visual track of the object even through my binoculars. The orange object reappeared after a few minutes moving lower in the sky from west to east.  I had the other witness look through the window and by then we observed two orange objects moving from west to east.  We lost view of the objects as they past our local tree line after a few minutes. I have never seen this type of flying object. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Well, to tell the truth I am actually in Renton, but I put in a nearby Seattle area with a different zip code with a similar view in order to remain somewhat anonymous online. So you could use Bryn Mawr as the neighborhood online if you would like to be more specific. I was intrerested to see that you seem to have received quite a few orange fire ball type sightings from across the country.  Thanks for your reporting database. ((END ADDENDUM)) (( ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) BTW, if you are trying to pinpoint a latitude and longitude, I would estimate the first orb to be over Tukwila or Kent, WA.

((HOAX??))  Large bright white light moving in zig-zag pattern across the sky.;2015-11-20 18:00:00;1 minute;Large bright white light moving in zig-zag pattern across the sky. I was outside walking my dog, and I looked up at the sky to watch the stars.  I noticed a very bright light that was about two and a half times the size of the surrounding stars.  At first it was moving forward at a pretty decent speed, then it started moving faster in a zig zag pattern.  It continued in the zig zag pattern until I could not see it anymore. Note: The light appeared to be a bright white-ish color.  Also, the object made no noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  We can't help but wonder whether this might be a hoax.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Fireballs with flashing object at rear.;2020-03-25 21:00:00;20 seconds;Fireballs with flashing object at rear. According to reports on social media the object(s) seen which appeared to be a cluster of burning red and yellow fireballs was the result of a Space X Falcon 9 failing to make a deorbit burn. The following tweet link provides the explanation and shows a sky trajectory of Northeast which aligns with my personal sighting and as seen in social media videos.  (Falcon 9 space x explanation below)  https://twitter.com/shawntelford/status/1375303570019389440?s=21  I viewed the objects from the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle looking to the east for approximately 20 seconds. To note, on the tail end of the burning fireball object appeared to be a flashing plane object on the same trajectory path. Nearby animals such as the neighbor dog and coyotes in the greenbelt 100yds to the east were quiet. However, the coyotes about 30 minutes later did start howling- to note on this, they have been howling during evening hours regularly the last two weeks.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
