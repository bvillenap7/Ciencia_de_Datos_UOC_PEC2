The thing was moving slowly towards the west, away from the city until it was out of sight. The craft was silent. There were about other people on the beach at the time. My wife and I were just coming from a late dinner (but just two beers each) and we were walking our dog.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
UFO's are for real!;2000-04-08 18:00:00;20 minutes;UFO's are for real! I live in Seattle Wa. And on April 8,2000 I was in Downtown Seattle at about 6:30 pm. Up in the sky was a British Airways 747-400 flying over downtown Seattle heading North. As I watched it fly over it was about 2500 ft up and the sky ceiling was about 15,000 with partly overcast but bright skies. I noticed  what I thought to be the big dipper out early  ( I have these red tinted sunglasses that reduce the glare alot). I watched the glowing objects which were about 8 of them just stay in a formation that looked like the big dipper. But then they moved into a diamond formation and then a circle formation, and then a pointed arch similar to a arrowhead. I was quite in disbelief because I was watching a formation of objects in the clouds that looked like stars, and were in a perfect lineup of the other in otherwords they didnt move out of formation. I watched them float thru the clouds and and other objects seemed to turn on at the bottom of the formation. And then in the corner of my eye I caught a object heading over the tops of the downtown buildings at a great speed. I watched it soar just over the buildings and I saw it perfectly. It was chrome,kinda eggshaped, and the size of a small airplane similar to a Pipercub. It had no wings,no jet intake or outlet,no sound,no lights, and no windows. I watched it fly over and disappear over the buildings. The original formation seemed to be in a circle formation when it passed over, kinda like they were watching it. Noone else seemed to see I was in shock! And then the original formation seemed to disappear in the clouds. No jets from McChord AFB were flying after the objects, and I still see it so clean in my mind. Just so everyone knows. Iam studying for my private pilots license, and I know what aircraft look like. This wasnt an aircraft. And no Government, or person for now on can tell me UFO's dont exist! I saw something. ((NUFORC Note:  A British Airways 747 can be seen flying to the north over the University District of Seattle almost nightly at between 1815 and 1830 hrs. (PDT).  Please see similar sounding reports from Ketchikan, AK, in late May 2000, and Hawaii on 03JN00.));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Ufo's over Downtown Seattle;2000-04-08 18:35:00;2-3minutes;Ufo's over Downtown Seattle At about 6:40 PM I was watching a British Airways 747-300 flying over Downtown Seattle, going north at about 2,000-2,500 feet. After the 747 passed by I was looking at the clouds formation. Since it was a very bright and glaring day I wore my red tinted sunglasses that reduced the glare alot so I was able to make out shapes of the clouds. As I watched I noticed this formation in the clouds that very dim (The clouds were about 10,000-11,000 ft up) They were very dim and white I thought they might be stars, but they changed shapes. And were in a perfect formation. The first formation was of a diamond formation with two objects away in the formation. Second there were about 8-9 objects in the formation. And they seemed to go in and out of the clouds. I thought It was balloons there were loose but they were too high. They seemed to change into different formations and fade or go higher. After watching these I noticed a Silver egg shaped object go from west to east over downtown and it was at least 2500-3000 feet up There was no sound or shape they I would see as a airplane because I study and watch aircraft all the time and play the Microsoft Flight Sim 2000 This object that was silver just flew over the city and the other formations seemed to fade away. I think They were using the clouds as a cover because of the brightness and they wouldnt be seen. Well, I saw them.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Anybody else see another green light in Seattle?;2000-10-23 22:00:00;2-3 seconds;Anybody else see another green light in Seattle? The two of us were watching a movie when we saw a bright green object fly over our 4 story condo.  We were up on the top floor & we saw it through our sliding glass window which looks out to the West.   Our initial reaction was disbelief at what we both had just witnessed.  My first inclination was that it had to be a meteor.  It was the brightness & green color of fireworks but the size, speed, closeness, & lateral movement across the sky made it apparent that it was not that.   We both jumped up & went onto the porch to see if we could determine what it was.  It was very quiet outside & I was surprised at how clear the sky was- especially for Seattle this time of year.  We turned on the news to see if anyone else had witnessed this- that's when we decided to check this websight & report what we saw.   The interesting thing is that 3 days ago (on 10/18) someone had reported seeing the same thing in this area.  The object was travelling in the NW direction & they noticed aircraft going in that same direction.  We noticed aircraft in the area, but this is nothing unusual due to the fact that we're only 20 miles from SeaTac airport.  This object appeared to have a tail like a comet, although it could have been caused by the speed that it travelled across the sky.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
High, fast moving whiteish shape heading north;2002-08-02 12:30:00;5min;High, fast moving whiteish shape heading north While on top of an eight story building, watching the Blue Angels practice a whiteish, egg shaped form crossed from south to north at an exceptional altitude.  Commercial planes fly through this space quite a bit...but this was at least three times higher moving at about the same speed as a 777 at 25000 feet;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Two Crafts. One sighting.;2007-03-27 17:00:00;20 seconds;Two Crafts. One sighting. 2/27/08 At about 430 pst we noticed what we thought was a balloon rapidly rising and falling and changing colors from red to silver to white and emitting a strange aura in the northwestern sky above Lake Union.  We called a third person over to show him and ask his opinion about what he thought it could be only for him to point out a white ball/egg shaped craft flying from the east over lake Washington, continuing over lake union, and eventually disappearing behind the Space Needle. The craft made no sound and was flying at speeds not normal with planes that usually fly over Seattle. When we looked for the balloon object after the second object flew by, it was gone.  We have never seen anything like it before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
lights started appearing out of nowhere.;2012-06-27 02:15:00;15 minutes;lights started appearing out of nowhere. I was on patrol last night at my job in downtown Seattle, and just doing a routine rove around my building when strangely enough something caught my eye in the sky. As i looked up into the night shy for about 5 to ten minutes a bright flash appeared dead center in the sky witch kinda freaked me out, I have always believed in UFO's I have just never witness it in person until last night.  So i remained glued to the clear night sky and as soon as my eye's started to focus in on the stars there it was (first one) a faint redish yellow object appeared it had to be 80 or 90 thousand feet in the air way higher than any airplane I've seen before but it was traveling pretty fast no sound was heard and slowly vanished. At this point i was kinda freaked out but excited that i saw this. 5 minutes later as i continued to look around in the sky another (second one) this one was kinda scary as it was very close could of been approx 4 - 500 feet from where i was standing it was really bight, the color of light was a hyper white blue amber color and was descending to the street level really quick. Again there was no sound coming from it and out of nowhere it suddenly vanished behind the building that was about 2 blocks from our building.  At this point I hope someone else witnessed that too as i couldn't of been the only one that saw this. Almost instantly after witnessing that I was about to head back inside my building and saw what i still cant figure out what to actually call it (third one?.) Three green blips of light occurred right above that where I saw the bright light descend down behind the building. Kind of like a connect the dots type of motion is the best way to describe the event - Fist one flashed top, bottom left, then bottom right. Like i said before I have never witnessed anything this strange ever while working here in my 10 years, last night was definitely an eye opener. I will have my camera with me from this point forth.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
