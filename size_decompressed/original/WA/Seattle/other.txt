I was in Gasworks Park when I saw the object coming from the north. Its altitude was probably around 2000 feet.It twisted about as it proceded.It had the appearance of being made of plastic sheet. I had the thought that someone had glued together some plastic garbage bags  and filled the thing with  helium.It headed  south, over Lake Union. I didn't watch it out of sight so I don't know what happened to it. ((NUFORC Note:  We are quite familiar with Gasworks Park in Seattle.

I and a witness saw a black helicopter like object in a very populated area af Seattle Wa, got a good long look at it but it was night.;1992-01-01 00:00:00;2 MIN;I and a witness saw a black helicopter like object in a very populated area af Seattle Wa, got a good long look at it but it was night. I and a friend were looking in the sky above a restaurant on the corner of Market st. and 15th st. Seattle Wa and we observed an helicopter shaped object hovering 50 -100 yards in the air. The object made absolutely no noise and hovered with no movement (perfectly still) in the air for some time. The object was completely black but due to the overcast sky we were able to make out its shape in silhouette. It was like a helicopter but with out a visible propeller and it had two large square pontoon looking things on the right and left (from where we stood it seemed as though we were looking directly at the front or back of the object but i can not say for sure). When I spoke to my friend about it again last year he said that he remembers a small flashing light on the bottom of it but I don't remember this. We were joined by a stranger an he asked Do you see that? We all started to point and talk about it when the object took of south toward the side of Queen Anne hill. More specifically, it was perfectly still no wavering-nothing, then all of a sudden with out any sound or unnecessary movement it was moving at high speeds(jet like) it did not seem to accelerate but was just going that speed. Within less then one second it reached the side of the hill, ascended to just the crest and over the hill out of our view. I would estimate it covered the ground of about 3 miles in the matter of less then two seconds making no sound. I will speak to my friend again and see if he can give me a more accurate date as I have can not remember at this time what the year was.  This is the first time that i have reported the event other then retelling the story to close friends because in the past I know little about things of this nature and well had trouble believing it myself. Recently I have heard about sightings of similar objects and as soon as I heard what they were called I knew that it was the same thing that i had seen, Black Helicopters. Now that I know other people have seen them I am going to start to let people know that these things are real and that something is happening that involves these objects. I have made some speculation as to what i think that they are but as a witness I think that it would be improper to speculate in the forum. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

And lo, the star which they had seen in the west suddenly went before them and came to rest over the place...;1996-06-01 07:00:00;1 minute;And lo, the star which they had seen in the west suddenly went before them and came to rest over the place... On the morning of the first day of Folk Life Fest (1996), I was at the Seattle Center checking out the stars--one in particular, low on the horizon to the south suddenly sped west to a spot possibly over the Naval Submarine Base Bangor in Bremerton.  It moved too quickly to be a conventional jet, and since it had been stationary, accelerated rapidly and then returned to a stop, it defies what I understand about current satellite technology.  The oddest thing about it was that it must have been rather low in orbit since it produced sound similar to that of a jet, but without any sonic booms.  Shortly after its sound passed, a jetliner passed overhead from the opposite direction, and its sound trail was positioned only slightly behind it, whereas with the supersonic object's sound trail didn't reach my position until the object had already stopped. Can you please send me information on Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)?;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

While the others were still inside I looked up at the stars for no particular reason. In the northwest sky, just above the big dipper I noticed about 6 orange amber dots in a V formation moving north above the big dipper. I told the others hey come check this out. One dot in the V seemed to be moving in towards one leg then back out, yet keeping pace with the formation. We moved to the backyard to get a better look. As this formation started to fade it seemed to rotate into a circle formation just before disappearing. The formation definitely seemed as though it was very far away (not in our atmosphere), and possibly leaving our planet. I have seen shooting stars and satellites many times before. This was not one of them.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Angled orange light array traveling at stupendous speed across I5 Highway near Boeing Field in the evening.;1998-09-15 18:00:00;1 second;Angled orange light array traveling at stupendous speed across I5 Highway near Boeing Field in the evening. These pictures of the objects with orange lights in an angled array has prompted me to mention what I saw as I traveled North on I5 in the vicinity of Boeing Field one night. it was starting to get dark and I saw only the orange lights -  no discernible craft. The shape was an upside down L traveling left to right across the field of my vision at an estimated 1 mile distance and 1000 ft. altitude. Now the part that is so incredible: The speed was so tremendous that even what I believe to be somewhat distant moved 120 degrees or more across my field of vision in literally a blink of the eye. It was so fast that my eyes could hardly track it. If I had blinked, I probably would have missed it. It was faster than any plane or rocket I have ever witnessed. It must have been making many thousands of miles per hour! Until I saw your website, I was not aware that other people had seen similar colored light arrays. My memory is now uncertain as to date and time but the object remains in my mind. I probably can't add much more to this report if contacted but hope it has some value.

Watched two flying objects headed NW, very low, very slow, at junction of Duamish River and West Seattle Bridge.;2000-02-02 19:49:00;aprox. 2 min;((NUFORC Note:  The objects were C-17 military transport a/c flying in formation.)) Watched two flying objects headed NW, very low, very slow, at junction of Duamish River and West Seattle Bridge. At approx 1949 hrs I witnessed two large low flying objects. These objects appeared to be less than 2000' in altitude. Unknown speed, but very very slow. I work in an environment that is located right on the water of the Duamish River, and adjacent to the West Seattle Bridge. As this employment results in working all shifts day or night, I physically see numerous aircraft arriving and departing Boeing Field which is very close by. The ONLY two times that I have physically seen ANY aircraft in this area that were as low as the two objects sighted was the departure of Air Force 1, and the Blue Angels. Even Air Force 1 was travelling faster on dearture (which went directly over me) than these two sighted objects. Although the shape was hard to discern, there were two distinctive white strobe type lights on what appeared to be the outer edges of the objects, both had the same lighting structure, which I also will state I have never seen this type of lighting on commercial aircraft landing at Boeing Field. NOTE: C17 link below has a excellent pic of a up close wing tip, I cannot see a large type beacon/strobe that would simulate the type of strobe I witnessed. Both objects were (to my experience and location) too far east for a Boeing Field departure, and were almost directly above the River. They then passed over the West Seattle Bridge and did not appear to change altitude or speed, they continued this heading until my view was blocked by buildings, and cargo cranes on the north side of the bridge. I did not see these objects again, however, listening to Art Bell and hearing Peter speak of this event at the end of the 10:00 hr, my shift change took place at 11:00pm, I then immediately turned on KIRO 7 Eyewitness news @ 11, newsperson Hutchinson addressed the sighting and to the best of my recollection she stated that the DOD informed their  office of 2 F117A's, out of McCord Air Force Base.

Two Jumbo Jets flying low and slow.;2000-02-02 19:49:00;3 min;((NUFORC Note:  Formation flight of military C-17 transports, flying at approximately 1,500 feet.)) o Jumbo Jets flying low and slow. At 19:49 I was driving a Metro bus on NE 143 ST, making a left onto 30 Ave NE. While waiting at the stop sign to make the turn, I saw two large airplanes traveling east over the NorthCity area, coming towards LakeCity. After I made the turn onto 30 AV NE I tried to keep an I on them as they where flying VERY low and very close together, one following the other. Both planes had numerous lights on. When they got over LakeCity they banked to their right, about 90deg. It was not a sharp bank but a slow bank over a few miles, where they then continued south out of my view. In this area we see a lot of planes flying low due to the numerous large airfields around. I have just never seen two large plane in this close a formation this low before. If I had to make a guess as to altitude I would say between 1500 and 3000 feet max. Distance between planes 1/8 of a mile. I am making this report because I was listening to Peter on Art Bell's Wed., night show when he reported this. Since I saw the two objects that where reported, I thought I would say what I saw.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

UFO seen crossing I-5 Ship Canal Bridge from East to West (shaped like a rowboat, iridescent orange, with a small blue light at front);2000-06-15 23:11:00;~25 seconds;UFO seen crossing I-5 Ship Canal Bridge from East to West (shaped like a rowboat, iridescent orange, with a small blue light at front) A friend and I had just started driving Northbound on I-5, coming from Highway WA-520, and were in the middle of an argument, when we both stopped arguing: in front of us, over the freeway, was a UFO crossing the Interstate 5 Ship Canal Bridge from East to West, at maybe walking, jogging, or running speed (possibly 3-10MPH). It was mostly a glowing iridescent amber or orange color, emitting its own light, but also had a small, bright, dark-blue light at the front. It was shaped almost like a rowboat, but was about as big as a house (single-story, rambler size). I could see no wings, propellers, wheels, pontoons, doors, windows, rudder, or blimp-like parts to it. It did not look like any floatplane (common in the Lake Union area), regular airplane, glider, helicopter, balloon, or blimp that I had seen before.  If it were a blimp, it had no gondola or passenger car visible below it, and no visible tailfins and at the top of the amber/orange light, it was straight across, not rounded at all. It was moving too slowly to be a plane.  (It would have fallen out of the sky.) And it was much too large to be a helicopter, and wasn't even close to the shape of any I've ever seen. Again, it was about as large as a small house. I knew very little about UFOs, and wasn't sure I even believed in them, but because I had heard that UFOs could quickly zip away, I tried to not even blink as we approached its path.  My friend was driving so I unbuckled my seatbelt, and got up on my car seat so that I could quickly turn around, and keep my eye on it through her side windows and I did this. It was close enough that I could have thrown a baseball, and hit it. As we passed it, I was not sure that I could still see it.  And as we kept on going past, I could no longer see anything there at all!  I said to her, It's gone! or something like that. I no longer saw any indication that it was still there. DETAILS:  It was at night, and dark.  At least the one lamp it was passing over was out (not lit). (Two or three of them might have been out.) Other freeway lamps were lit. I recall no rain.  So I believe it was dry. When I first saw it, we had just entered I-5 not many seconds before that and only part of it had come over the bridge yet. It continued to move in the air, across the width of the bridge from East to West.  As we passed it, we were, I believe, in the far right lane and the back end of it had just then crossed over the railing of the bridge, on the West. It had crossed over the bridge just a short distance before mid-span, and was maybe 20-40 feet above the lamp posts. The area where the amber or orange light was emitting (not reflecting), I would guess was between 6 and 10 feet high, but not more than 20 or 25 feet and maybe between 50 and 80 feet long. The entire craft seemed lighted up by this light, except for the small blue light at front. Neither she nor I seem to recall the exact year or time of year, or the time of day. I am thinking that it was either in 1999 or 2000. I didn't report it then because I was afraid that we had seen something that we weren't supposed to see, something from the military or government, possibly. She didn't report it either. To date, she won't even discuss it with me!  I am reporting it now because, years later, I have found out that UFOs are far more common than I had then realized, and because whatever it was we saw moving slowly over the bridge was now more than 10 years ago, and now maybe the owner of it wouldn't really care since it's been so long, and because I just wanted to finally report it. I only wish I could recall the date and time. This event came as a total surprise to me, and was startling at the time, especially since it seemed to me that while the craft was visible from one angle, it was apparently non-visible from another or else it became invisible to my eyes or it moved so quickly (after moving so slowly) that I didn't even see it jump away. I didn't take my eyes off of it, or blink (at all, or very little) I just couldn't see it anymore, even though we were still pretty close to where I had last seen it, a little more than maybe 7 lanes away. It was in our view for maybe 20-30 seconds. MISC: I think the height of the bridge is over 180' above the water or streets below. A Wikipedia article says it's about 119 feet wide. We were going too fast to know whether or not it was making any sound (probably between 55 and 65MPH). The lights on it were steady, and none were blinking. There were no red or white lights on it, from our angle. CONJECTURE AND/OR IMPRESSIONS:  I am not sure why, but I got an impression (or imagination) that there was much more to the airship than we were able to see but we were so close to it that it seems unlikely that I would have missed seeing more of the craft. It seems unlikely to me that the rest of it was hidden by the cover of night though, after seeing some recent science articles, I suppose that it could have been hidden by current or advanced invisibility technology. I also had the impression that the craft we saw was visible from one angle, but not visible from another, vs. either it taking off so fast that I didn't even see it move or disappearing coincidentally right as we were passing its back end. ©2012.

The object seemed to be hovering just west of Aurora Avenue North and to the south of Woodland Park zoo. At first I thought it was a helicopter, as it seemed to be hovering for over 10 seconds. But I then noticed that it had more of the contours of an airplane. I rolled down my window expecting to hear a helicopter sound, but I heard absolutely no sound from the object. The object than started flying very slowly and completely silently at what seemed to be too low of a speed for a commercial aircraft, heading southwards across Wallingford and Lake Union towards Seatac airport. I ran home to get my binoculars and try to view the object from my deck. By the time I got to my deck, the object was far away and not very visible with my binoculars.

Only one group of small clouds in the sky (Just went outside to check). Sitting in my room with the curtains open watching TV. Saw it as soon as it passed into view over rooftop within frame of window. Saw 1 single bright orange object very low in the sky. Glowing bright orange, looked as though it was gliding. Orange glow faded to bright blue then faded completely away (vanished) well before reaching the next 'out of sight' boundary witch was the neighbors rooftop. Traveled in a perfectly straight line towards the N.E. It flew below the cloud layer at one point during its flight path. Looked lower in the sky than commercial aircraft. Seemed larger than a single prop airplane like a Cessna (difficult to judge its distance by other aircraft that were in the area). Faster than an airplane, slower than a meteorite. It left no tail, streak, or visible wake of any kind. Extremely graceful and smooth. Was wearing glasses at the time of the sighting. The object definitely had a silhouette and shape but was moving to fast to make out its exact shape. Sighting lasted approximately 2 and a half to 3 seconds.  After it faded out there were no visible objects in its flight path. As if it had simply vanished. I opened my window immediately after words to listen for sound, there was no sound at all not even from insects.  10 to 20 seconds later normal aircraft were spotted within view of my window and those appeared much higher in the sky and also had the normal aircraft sounds that would be associated with them. It does defy all my current knowledge and experience of weather, meteorites, and aircraft. I require more information about what I've just witnessed before I could tell myself for sure what it was.

Slow-flying crescent made up of lots of little balls flies over downtown Seattle;2001-11-18 02:22:00;20 seconds;Slow-flying crescent made up of lots of little balls flies over downtown Seattle While observing the meteor storm from my decidedly bad vantage point (inner city, facing northwest), I noticed a slow-moving object high up in the sky.  The object was crescent-shaped, colored a medium grey (judging by the color reflected from the city lights below), and seemed to have a texture like it was made from dozens of small balls or spheres. It flew very slowly from north-northeast to south-southwest, and was accompanied by a very faint rumbling, engine-like noise which I could make out over the normal nighttime sounds of downtown Seattle.  Once it was nearly overhead, it turned slowly west and faded from view, and the rumbling noise faded away with it. The size was approximately that of a thumbnail held at arm's length, and it flew with the rounded portion of the crescent shape aimed forward.  There were no light emitters of any type visible on it. Its height could not be accurately estimated I have only the amplitude of its engine noise to base any guess upon.  And if I tried to guess using only that, it would have been at least 5,000 feet in altitude. I'm on the approach path for commercial airliners, and I know what they look and sound like from varying distances.  This was *not* a commercial flight. According to my handheld GPS, I'm located at 47°36'23N by 122°19'51W.  This is in downtown Seattle near the monorail terminus. This is the first of three unidentifyable objects I will be reporting on tonight. Incidentally, from my decidedly poor vantage point, highly restricted viewable area, and severe light pollution conditions, I still observed approximately 150 meteors between 1am & 4am with only one being very substantial. The projectile itself glowed an eye-piercing whitish violet and was surrounded by a darker violet coma and the long tail was green & white with violet & blue-violet along its edges.  It's a fair guess it left some elements in our upper atmosphere that aren't even on the periodic table yet.  All but three of the meteors I saw were Leonids.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Very unusual aircraft..???;2002-05-07 04:00:00;3 minutes plus;Very unusual aircraft..??? I noticed lights from an aircraft...moving slowly, yet loudly over Elliott Bay coming toward my home in Magnolia.  I went to the window and watched as it came closer...then saw a second aircraft following it.  They looked like they had very large headlights (two) with a cluster of lights, perhaps one light was red, in what appeared to be about 4 smaller lights in the center of the headlights.  I couldn't see any shape to the body or back of the aircraft...yet, after I watched them pass...I went to a window in the front of my home and saw an almost identical light pattern on the back of the aircraft as it left.  Very strange, indeed.  I called KIRO News, to see if anyone had reported seeing them.  I was told that they hadn't heard anything, but would check into it.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Small Ascending Object Sighted in Mid-Morning Hours in Downtown Seattle, WA;2002-05-30 09:45:00;10-20 secs;Small Ascending Object Sighted in Mid-Morning Hours in Downtown Seattle, WA I sighted this object from the 7th floor of our building (see address below).  This object was difficult to identify because it was either very small or far away. The object gradually ascended and disappeared in the clouds.  The object appeared to be moving from the Southeast towards the Northwest.  It had the shape of a kite, but I thought it unusual to be flying kites in this area because our office is located in one of the main approaches to Sea-Tac airport.  I do not think the object was a balloon although it did gradually ascend in a smooth motion.  I first sighted the object at a declination of 60 degrees and lost it about 80 degrees.

I saw a green object above Seattle, at about 5:45 AM on 10/1, occuring at the time of a northern lights display.;2002-10-01 05:43:00;2 seconds;I saw a green object above Seattle, at about 5:45 AM on 10/1, occuring at the time of a northern lights display. While running this morning, headed north in the vicinity of NW 80th Street in Seattle, I saw a bright green object high in the sky, to the northeast. It swept across only that part of the sky and was moving in a slight arc at a fast, constant speed. It most resembled a meteor, except for its bright green color. It had about the luminescence of a Fourth of July sparkler. At this time, to the north, a northern lights display was occuring, so I figured at the time that a meteor had been colored in some way by that northern lights event. Then I heard on the radio that a green object had been spotted south of Seattle earlier in that 5 o'clock hour, so I thought I would contribute this perspective. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor.

Strange message on phone line and dog uneasy;2003-05-01 22:00:00;15 minutes;Strange message on phone line and dog uneasy It was just before 10:00pm on Thursday May 01, 2003. I made a call to someone in Snohomish County. The phone rang about 5 times when a voice came on and said there is no mourning for a world that is weeping. The phone was still ringing. Then the canned operator voice came in and said there is no answer, for 75 cents we will try your call, etc. And the phone continued to ring. I thought, maybe this person incorporated rings on to his answering machine and put used the phone company message in it. I hung up and called the number again  and but there was no answer. I called my son and told him and also my brother who was here at the time about the bizarre incident. The voice was clear and professional sounding. It actually made me a bit edgy to think someone had tapped into my phone line. I went right to bed and within 5 minutes, my dog who was in the living room, started to bark at something. I got back up went into the living room while he was barking at something toward Puget Sound. I live across the street from the beach. I waited for about 10 minutes watching but could see no one. He would not leave the window. I called the people in Snohomish again on Friday and they told me what their answering machine message said and it was nothing like the above. I will await my phone bill to see what shows up as this was a long distance call. I am the MUFON State Director for Western Washington and tend to try to find logic in all our cases. I am not sure what was going on that night but I do trust my animals when they sense something out of the ordinary.

A cluster of bright  pulsing  lights over downtown Seattle.  ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial body??  PD));2004-03-09 17:45:00;2 hours;A cluster of bright  pulsing  lights over downtown Seattle. A cluster of lights were seen over Seattle at about 17:45. Somewhat hard to see because of city lights and light cloud formation.  Looked like many stars grouped together, it seemed to be very high up and could not be seen sometimes by cloud coverage. When not obscured by clouds there was a pulsing of the lights and it traveled from over Seattle to over the Olympic Mountains.  It lasted about 2 hours before it was blocked from view. I first saw it as I was walking through a dark part of a downtown park (between Pike and Pine at Boren).  When I got to my apartment I told my neighbor about it and we went outside to see it.  Only had binoculars and when viewed through them you could see distinct bright lights like the head beams of an oncoming car. Viewing it from downtown Seattle was hard because of all the city lights. There were many aircrafts flying in the general area perhaps one of those had a better view.  Would like to know if anyone else saw this or not.  It did seem extremly high up and probably not noticed by any one because of the clouds.  When not blocked it was more noticable.

It appeared to move as if it were a very long and large balloon arch. It stayed mostly straight but would bend and flip occasionally. What made it seem like it couldn't be just balloons was the scale. Air traffic seemed to be about 500-700ft above the hill and the object seemed twice as far above. It stayed in a stationary position even when it twisted and bent shape.

Middle February, 2002, 3:00 pm, sunny day, black object east of Seattle, moving erratically within a limited area.;2005-02-15 15:00:00;5 minutes;Middle February, 2002, 3:00 pm, sunny day, black object east of Seattle, moving erratically within a limited area. I was studying for the bar exam on the 4th floor of the law library at Seattle University School of Law. It was a sunny day at about 3:00 in the middle February.  Looking east through large picture windows, I saw what I at first thought was a helicopter at a distance of about 5 miles. What intrigued me was that for an object that I thought was the size of a common traffic helicopter, it was moving incredibly fast. After comprehending that a common helicopter could not move to quickly, I began to think it was something else. I observed it for about 5 minutes or more. It seemed to move forwards and backwards and up and down rather erratically, not with the motion that one would expect from a helicopter, certainly not that of an airplane. It appeared to be hovering in that it had no specific direction. Assuming that it was about 5 miles away, which would have put it over southern Bellevue, I estimate that its movements were limited to about 200 yards, but without any pattern to the movement. It moved sort of like an insect would. The object appeared to be black, with no discerbable shape. As mentioned, I observed it for about 5 minutes, perhpas more, then turned away. When I looked back, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Metallic object hovering at altitude over downtown Seattle for at least 10 - 15 minutes - 07/13/05;2005-07-13 17:10:00;20 mins;Metallic object hovering at altitude over downtown Seattle for at least 10 - 15 minutes - 07/13/05 While sitting in traffic on northbound I-5 we observed an single object that appeared to be static on the sky and around 75 degrees above eastern horizon.  It was a shiney metallic object that appeared to have geometrical facets on top area of it.  Furthermore, we noticed that the area around the object appeared to have a halo due to the fact that it was a darker blue color than compared to the clear blue sky behind it. This halo appeared fuzzy and did not seem to have definite edges.   Due to the traffic barely moving along we were able to observe the object for around 10 mins as we slowly moved north towards downtown Seattle.  Also, since we weren't moving we were able to compare its size to the half moon that was also in that hemisphere of the sky.  Its size relative to the half moon was about 1/5 - 1/7 of the moon.  In relation to the moon it was north of it and higher towards the sky zenith.  When we compared it to fixed objects in our field of view it became obvious that it wasn't moving in relation to us. We lost sight of it when we entered the tunnels and express lanes of downtown Seattle. We saw it again when we were north of the Northgate Mall and just south of the King county line. It seemed to be in the same location in the sky relative to the horizon and moon as before. This time we only observed it for a couple of seconds before it seemed to vanish from the sky.  In the car we had 3 people (including the driver) of which two of us saw the object. All of us in the car have aerospace engineering backgrounds and have significant experience in identifying flying vehicles and their systems.   The two of us who observed the object concluded that we had never observed such an object before. We were quite surprised at how it was able to hold station so precisely and the fact that it appeared to have no aerodynamic lifting surfaces to it.

Object seen shot downward from small aircraft in Seattle area, followed by flash and huge discharge cloud.;2005-07-31 23:03:00;8 minutes;Object seen shot downward from small aircraft in Seattle area, followed by flash and huge discharge cloud. Last night at, Sunday, July 31, 2005, at 11:03 pm ( PST ) my friend ((name deleted)) and myself, were at Magnusun Park on the east shore line of Seattle ( west shore of Lake Washington ).  It was a nice night, mild clouds, lots of air traffic up here.. commercial flights, small craft....   I was seeing a number of the typical very brief shooting stars.  A friend of mine had called me on my cell phone, and I was talking with him... at this time, all of a sudden, my friend Kyle yells out excitedly.. did you see that  ?  I can't remember exactly what he said following that, but I remember assuming that he had just seen a shooting star...  It turns out that ((name deleted)) adamantly states that he was sure he had seen something shoot downward from one of two small planes that were in close proximity of each other, flying in opposite directions. I saw the planes a couple seconds after he saw this discharged object.  My best guess is that these planes were possibly flying 3 to 7 miles directly due west of where we were, which is very close in line with N.E. 75th St.  I Couldn't really estimate the altitude.. average for small craft I suppose. I learned from Kyle that this object he states was shot downward from the plane, was unmistakenly glowing red/orange in color.  Within 15 seconds, in that direction, there was a huge bright white flash, which seem to be more from the ground, than in the sky. It lit up the sky to a higher degree than lightning often would... just as a instant flash.  I thought the flash was quite strange, but was not yet alarmed.   Within another 15 seconds (and this is where it gets scary for me ) I saw a huge ominous dark cloud coming upward from the horizon.  ((name deleted)) unmistakenly saw this too !!   I am quite concerned about this ! I am sure many people must have atleast seen the strange and huge flash of light... We were in a unique place ( large unlit park ) to see the cloud ( which was slightly, but unmistakenly a darker shade than the sky surrounding it ) We heard no sounds, not even the engines of the planes in question. No sirens followed !;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

It was practically impossible to see they were almost under camofluage or changind colors to reflect the night sky.

Twin-engine jet fighter seen to STREAK west to east over Boeing Field in IFR conditions.;2005-10-29 18:51:00;5 sec.;Twin-engine jet fighter seen to STREAK west to east over Boeing Field in IFR conditions. This incident probably has nothing to do with a UFO sighting or event, but I include it here because of its utterly unusual nature.  On Friday night, October 29, 2005, at approximately 18:51 hrs. (local/Pacific), I was driving south on Interstate 5, and was just north of Boeing Field, near the Albro/Swift Exit.  I was driving in the right hand lane, which affords the best view of Boeing Field of any of the lanes, given that it allows a person to look down on the airport, located on the west side of the highway.  Despite the fact that my car radio was on (tuned to KING FM 98.1), and despite the fact that my windshield wipers were operating at a continuous setting, I became aware of the roar of jet engines, set at a high power setting.  Assuming that the aural report was from a jet aircraft taking off from the long runway (34 right), I glanced down at the airport to my right, expecting to see a jet beginning its take-off role.  However, my attention was drawn to a jet aircraft that was streaking across Boeing Field at very high speed, and very low altitude, transverse to prevailing air traffic, i.e. it was streaking across the runway, flying from west to east!  Although I could not see the fuselage of the aircraft, I could see the cones of white hot exhaust, together with the shock cones clearly visible, streaming out the exhaust nozzles of the aircraft, permitting positive identification of the aircraft as a military, twin-engine jet fighter, therefore probably an F-18, an F-15, or an F-14.  As the aircraft passed over Interstate 5, having passed over Boeing field at approximately mid-field, it executed a slight, e.g. 5-10 degree, roll to its right, and it disappeared from my vision, passing over the slight hill to the east of the highway.  I estimate that the aircraft was below 1,000 feet altitude, and perhaps below 500 feet, and it was traveling at between 200 and 400 knots.  The weather was poor, and the (lateral) visibility was not more than one mile, I estimate.  The ceiling, I suspect, was at approximately 1,000 feet, or less, and I was driving in light, though continuous, rain.  In my thirty one years in Seattle, and during the 28 years that I have held a commercial pilot's license, I have never witnessed such a dramatic event in the vicinity of Boeing Field.  Given that the weather was so poor, I presume that conditions were conducive to IFR (instrument flight reference) only.  The incident is being investigated by personnel who work in air traffic control.  They report that at least one other witness reported the peculiar incident.  I have no reason to believe that the incident was, in any way, related to a UFO sighting or incident.  I report it here, only because of its seemingly truly bizarre nature.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Disc shaped, blue and white coloured object slicing the sky very quickly.;2005-11-12 00:45:00;3 seconds;Disc shaped, blue and white coloured object slicing the sky very quickly. I am not a believer, which makes me wonder why I am reporting this.  My husband and I were watching a movie on tv last night.  At about 12:45am I witnessed this aspirin shaped object streak through the sky in a downwards direction for about 3 seconds.  It streaked downwards horizontally, that is the craft didn't move down but somewhat sliced downwards.  It was a pale blue on the top and white on the bottom.  The object itself was very bright. I was speechless and my husband got mad at me when I couldn't just spit it out what I had seen.  As soon as I got it out, he stood up, went to the window and saw the exact same thing, but out the other window in our livingroom.  He described it to me, without me describing it to him first. He saw the object move across the sky from one point, to another point and then very quickly vanish. He said that the object tilted, and moved downwards, also in a slicing movement. We went out on our balcony after the sightings, but did not see anything else.

Eradic moving, flashing light over West Seattle / Puget Sound.;2006-08-18 21:27:00;1-2 mins.;Eradic moving, flashing light over West Seattle / Puget Sound. I was on my deck at 9:25 which faces west and saw an aircraft of some sort with flashing lights over West Seattle, (probably over the water as it is hard to discerne)anyway, it was bright at first and moving in a southerly direction.  I grabbed the binocs and watched it and by this time it was moving away from me at a west/n. west direction.  The strange thing though is that this light, flashing white and red was not in a regular fashion like a jet and the light was bouncing in my view....like not steady at all, it would be high then to the side, then lower, very eradic.  I've actually seen this several times and I noticed someone else a couple months ago reported a similar sighting wondering if anyone else had seen this.  I have several times and this is NO PLANE or helicopter or star in my opinion, this thing moves~travels in a very eradic way.  I also see dozens of jets and other small aircraft on a daily basis being right near and under the flight patterns, so I know what they look like and how they behave in their flight patterns. I watched this bouncy light as it went off towards the Olympic Mountains and out of my view.  I can't imagine no-one else seeing this thing, so would be interesting to see if there are any other reports.  There were commercial aircraft in their normal flight patterns above this thing when I was watching it...not even close to the same.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I hoped I had time to video tape it with my digital cam and rushed in and did get a couple shots of it.

I woke up sometime around 12:00 and shook her awake because I remembered that there was supposed to be some eclipse that she wanted to see tonight.  We went out on the 8th floor balcony looking for the moon (which we never found) and then she told me she thought she'd found it.  I looked toward the direction she was pointing, I'd say north east of where we were and saw a yellow (She said orangish red, I'm color blind I guess) sort of crescent shaped figure in the sky over shoreline or possibly edmonds.  I thought it might have been the moon at first but it was upside down, kind of like a frown, then I remembered that it was an eclipse so the moon would look funny.  We both kept watching it for while until we noticed the change in altitude, or distance possibly.  Sadly enough neither me or my girlfriend noticed anything odd for at least 10 minutes, it moved so slow!!!  Like the second hand on a clock.  After about 45 minutes we both figured that it had changed directions at least 4 times until it had gotten too small to see but it never went behind anything, which meant it must have been higher up than it looked.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

brief sighting of object with faint amber lights traveling over Seattle;2009-10-07 20:10:00;10 sec;brief sighting of object with faint amber lights traveling over Seattle Looking due south from my house sometime shortly after 8 p.m., saw a very faint shape heading south about 60 deg up from the horizon.  At first I thought it might be a reflection from a ground-based spotlight, (i.e. the kind you'd see at a movie premiere, or in the 20th century fox logo, etc.) but looking closer it appeared to be a shape moving in a linear southbound path.  It was faint enough that I can't be sure of a coherent outline, but my best guess is that it was bow-shaped, i.e. an archery bow without the string.  Faint amber lights were spread across it, perhaps 10 or 20 in total.  The object was perhaps twice the diameter of the moon in width.  There was fog to the south, and it moved behind that and disappeared.  I kept looking around for another 20 minutes or so, but saw nothing further.  First time I've seen anything like this, I'm a skeptic about UFO sightings, and it was brief enough that I'm still questioning what exactly I saw, or if it was some kind of optical artifact.  I'm willing to accept that I might be mistaken about all this, but it was still affecting enough that I'm here posting this account.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Visually observed and photographed pentagon-shaped/faceted object light colored/no lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a UFO.  PD));2010-07-23 21:15:00;15-25min;Visually observed and photographed pentagon-shaped/faceted object light colored/no lights. Tonight just after 9pm I was taking a break from the computer, looking out my window southerly towards the Seattle Center/Space Needle from my lower QAnne apt.  The night sky was clear with a full-moon a balmy evening with excellent visibility and no clouds. I’m on the top-floor of a 4 story building the object appeared below the elevation of the Space Needle, and appeared to be centered over the Elliott Bay area, due west of downtown Seattle….approx. 10-15 degrees west of the Space Needle. I watched it for a few minutes, still not sure what I was seeing.  I thought maybe it was a plastic bag…caught in a thermal…but the movement was different:  it appeared to undulate….“wobble”…..and moving slightly in a slip/sliding motion. The object made no noise, had no navigation lights, didn’t move like a conventional man-made aircraft/rotor-craft…and appeared to have a faceted/angular body style….pentagon-shaped, instead of being disc/saucer-like. I grabbed my camera and tripod, and photographed several shots from my apt. window area.  Despite the camera being secure, some of the imagery showed a blur…indicating that the object was moving it wasn’t camera shake, etc. I then ran over to the top of the Seattle Center parking garage for a better vantage point.  The garage rooftop has an elevation approx. the same as my own apt’s, but the object appeared to be lower in the horizon, still appearing to be over the Elliott Bay area, west downtown Seattle. I took an additional 10 or so shots from this vantage point.  The object finally dipped below a tree-line, obscuring my viewpoint and was no longer observable. I returned home, downloaded the digital files for review.  Successive frames showed movement from the object, because of the blurring it induced.  Again, the camera was on a tripod with a timer being used there wasn’t camera shake induced.  2-3 shots are relatively crisp…and show the pentagon-shaped body in others it appears to be almost an “upside down hat“, with more mass below the “brim“.  The camera I was using, a Nikon Coolpix 8400 only has a limited zoom range, 24-85mm + tele-zoom, but I was still able to reveal a distinctive body shape.   Given the limited optics, and the relative crispness of a few of the images, I felt I could guesstimate the approximate area of it’s hover…which appeared to again, be over Elliott Bay. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a UFO, we suspect.  The object may be a plastic bag, or some other object which may have been filled with helium.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Huge space shuttle like --- blimp like object observed floating above Seattle;2010-08-28 17:30:00;observed 5 minutes;Huge space shuttle like --- blimp like object observed floating above Seattle I was looking straight across Puget Sound from Suquamish in Kitsap county towards the Seattle skyline when I saw an object hovering above North Seattle about 2,000 feet above the tops of the buildings. The object looked very similar to the Space Shuttle only it would have had to have been 10 or 15 times the size of the space shuttle.  It was white and reflected a lot of light as if it was quite shiny.  If it wasn't a giant Blimp made in the shape of a very large space shuttle---then it was something that I have never seen before.  I called my wife on the cell phone because I knew she was traveling on a Washington State Ferry just leaving the downtown area of Seattle.  I asked her if there was a Huge Giant Blimp in the shape a space shuttle hovering over the city--she said she could see something similar to what I was describing but there were too many buildings and trees blocking her view to get a real good look at it.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Unfathomable beauty in the sky in the form of something which I cannot explain;2011-10-22 15:00:00;3 minutes;Unfathomable beauty in the sky in the form of something which I cannot explain When I came across the Seattle Space Needle, a formation of people was standing around. In the sky, suddenly I heard a big bang, and as I looked up, at first I saw nothing. I really don't know how to describe what happend next.  A wave of relaxation sprung through my limbs and into my fingers. I could even fell the sting in my finger nails. It felt like when you fall asleep and accidently block the passage of blood to your arm, and a million ants start to crawl up the muscles, chewing away. As this happened, it was as if (and this part will sound most strange) me and this formation of people, suddenly felt the same thing. But not merely felt the relaxation, but felt instead  each other. As if there was a third arm infront of me, I would try to move it, but could not. Another bang interupted the flow and the most beautiful thing I've ever seen appeared infront of me. I could not begin to explain it. I can hardly even remember the shape of it, as if my brain is unable to fathom it's form. I feel strange even typing this. There were five of these things, and they flew perhaps a 1000 feet above us , watching. Seconds later, they were gone.  We just looked at each other, as if in denial, looked at each other with this look that I'll never forget, as if we were discusted with the other persons behaviour. As if the moment it happened, we didn't believe it. That is why I write this so late. I hope that others do the same, so that the story goes out.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
A yellow orange shield shaped object about 3 to 4ft tall with a flame inside traveling in a S/SE direction at treeline.;2012-07-01 22:50:00;30 to 45 seconds;A yellow orange shield shaped object about 3 to 4ft tall with a flame inside traveling in a S/SE direction at treeline. On Sunday July 1, 2012 in King county just outside the city limits of Seattle, Washington, at approximately 10:50 pm, my husband glanced out of the front window and made an unusually strong exclamation what is that so I immediately turned around to look out the window as well.   We have large picture windows which join at the NE corner of the house in our living room and we were each seated on either side of the end table with lamp situated in the corner of the window.  I saw a large glowing yellow/orange kind of shield shaped object with a flame in the middle moving fairly swiftly and smoothly at tree level I jumped up to move quickly to the windows on the side of the house and and back patio windows to watch the object move past the side of our house toward Renton, which borders the west side and back of our property.   It continued to move evenly seeming self propelled until it was behind a tree in the back SE corner of our property and I could see it glowi! ng through the branches until it was gone from my sight.  I almost thought it had slowed, but I believe it was probably traveling a little more easterly away from us. I had never seen anything like this before and was surprised at the size and how close to us it was traveling. I was most fearful of the flame in the middle if it were to be caught in the trees or even land and start a fire.  I told my husband that the only thing I could even imagine was like a hot air balloon, but there was no balloon you could see and it was not that large.  I have never seen a hot air balloon in this area and that time of night, the size and close proximity to the houses and trees made no sense. It looked to be maybe 3 to 4 feet tall give or take and I would estimate the angle when I point to where I first saw the object to where it disappeared to be about 165 degrees and the sighting lasted maybe 30 to 45 seconds.  The front of our home faces north possibly slightly northwest and the object was traveling from the north heading toward our home heading south probably slightly more southeast. We had a call that night that my brother-in-law had just taken his wife to the hospital emergency room on Sunday night at 10:36 pm,  so that was certainly weighting on our minds until we knew she would recover and then I began to think more about reporting what we saw shortly after the call so that it might be helpful in someway.  Hopefully I have given useful information. I wonder if this could have been some kind of lantern launched inappropriately? ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found her to be exceptionally eloquent and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.

15-18 lights seen over Seattle;2012-07-07 23:07:00;2 minutes;15-18 lights seen over Seattle A friend and I were standing in my driveway in the Crown Hill area of Seattle (near Holman rd) when we noticed some lights that were becoming visible from behind a sparse tree looking north around 11 PM.  They were solid lights much brighter than any stars in the sky, and looked like a moving constellation.  There were approximately 15-18 lights that all traveled from north to south in the sky, maintaining perfect orientation to each other.  They moved from one horizon to the other in about 2 minutes. No Sound at all.  I regularly see planes coming from the east toward Seattle and then turning south, but there was absolutely no air traffic visible during the siting.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Large fiery mass descends and breaks apart over Seattle July 4th, 2014.;2014-07-04 22:15:00;15 seconds;Large fiery mass descends and breaks apart over Seattle July 4th, 2014. My boyfriend and I were getting ready to watch the numerous firework shows that were visible from our deck.  We had channel 7 news on as well in case things weren't as visible. The glowing moon and the effects of the clouds running across it caught my attention.  I told my boyfriend to look as well.  Not too long after that perhaps less than 2 minutes later.  I could no longer see the striped-bands of clouds illuminated over the moon as I just did. Now the entire moon (which was in crescent form btw) was encased in what looked like a large yellow glowing...light I guess.  As if the little crescent was in the center of this perfect glowing yellow/amber hue/glow/light. Just then from what looked like the bottom tip/point of the moon, directly under the bottom point in the moon, and this yellow glow around the moon was still apparent and actually blocked a little of the vision of where this debris came from---but anyway     From this area in the sky, and out of nowhere it seemed, fell these flaming large objects.  It started as a huge mass and I didn't know whether I was watching a meteor, something on fire in the sky falling or what?     Anyway, this mass broke off into what looked like 2 fragments but could well have been more...could only see this initial fiery breaking down of whatever was falling. Soon after the breaking down, just like some normal thing in flames, it went out, and I feel I could tell for only a second that when the flames went out there was still an object in free fall. My boyfriend and I had been talking to one another the whole time.  He saw everything as well, and it truly perplexed us!  Main firework show had not begun, a lot of air traffic out there in the skies, which kept my boyfriend and I checking out the different aircrafts. We looked to the TV for any explanation...where we saw in text under the news reporters that sky divers were falling.  Which I thought was odd and rather dangerous, but kind of bought it and put my guard down. I looked dramatically for anything similar to that all night.  Nothing matched what I saw.  And I was outside for awhile.  Various fireworks and cannons and aircrafts could not be substituted for the large mass descending completely on fire.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Small white cloud displays unusual movements west of Mt Rainier in Washington State;2017-06-22 17:40:00;2 minutes;Small white cloud displays unusual movements west of Mt Rainier in Washington State I was looking south from a friend's condominium deck in the Seattle community of Ballard.   We could clearly see Mt. Rainier, approximately 75 miles to the south.  A small, white cloud appeared close to the west flank of the mountain, approximately 2/3 of the way to the summit.  Over a period of two minutes, the white cloud began to behave in an odd manner as it drifted, and then moved very rapidly to the west, straight away from Rainier, maintaining a constant elevation.  As we were watching, the cloud abruptly stopped, and then dissolved before our eyes. Airplanes could be seen it the same general area, before, during and after the cloud was seen moving.  They were also to the west of Rainier, and presumably taking off to the north from Sea-Tac airport.  These airplanes were clearly darker than the object, and their direction and motion was entirely different.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Black cloud object passes over West Seattle;2017-10-03 19:10:00;90 seconds;Black cloud object passes over West Seattle On the date of October 3rd, 201,7 at 19:10 (dusk) while working in my back yard I had just dumped some brush down our back hill and was planning to end, due to the vanishing light. As I was returning into the yard, because of the slope, my face was pointing at an upward angle and I saw an object that looked like a small black mound (upon reflection it seemed like a small black cloud) about 12 feet long.  At first, I thought a bunch of balloons because of its silence.  Then I thought a drone because of it’s speed.  But I realized that it was too dense to be a drone(unless a drone can fly with a blanket over it) and it was too consistent in shape for balloons tied together. This was at (according to a later compass reading) NNW 290 degrees, 20 feet above the trees across the street, and about 250 feet away. It proceeded in a horizontal line.  After staring at it for 10 seconds I ran into the house to get the binoculars as for some reason even though that close it didn’t seem distinct. As I came back out of the house (I later timed it) 62 seconds later and ran into the street it took a few moments to locate.  It was now I estimate over Lowman Beach, about 2-3 blocks away.  It was much smaller due to distance away and I could not bring it into focus. There was little to no wind yet this thing may have been moving 15-20mph. No one else was at home and I didn’t call neighbors as I just wanted to get binoculars and get a good look myself first.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

RE: UFO? in Seattle I was out on the porch looking south at the moon, and thought at first that I was looking at a star. It was to the left of the moon.  As I was looking around at the stars around the moon, I realized this was moving west.  It looked like one of the other stars, with the same white-bluish color, there was no flashing or any change in color or any trace behind its movement.  As I was watching it travel, at that distance must have been going close to warp speed :), its light just vanished into deep space.  It simply disappeared. UFO? or what? It was not a plane for sure, nor a satellite as the light just vanished. I'd like to know if anyone else saw this. (Oct. 6, 2019 8:10pm);47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Spotlight appeared on the ground and settled on me but as I escaped it disappeared.;2021-04-07 04:45:00;20 seconds;Spotlight appeared on the ground and settled on me but as I escaped it disappeared. I was driving to my 5am work shift. It was 4:45am and I was the only one on the road. I wasn’t even listening to music because I was trying to get my Apple Music to work and it wasn’t connecting. As I’m driving, a huge spotlight appears on the road above my car and slightly to the left. It quickly moves to the left, then it moves to the right. Then it sees my car and settles on my car and me. It was dead silent. I sped up to get away and it disappeared. I was driving north on 15th Ave before the Ballard bridge in Seattle, Washington. I’m not crazy, there was no streetlights or helicopters above me or anything and the moon wasn’t even visible like it was pitch black, silent, and I was alone. It was about 20 seconds long. I was unsettled all day. The beam of light wasn’t really visible, just the circle of light on the ground. It felt like someone shining a flashlight from above and seeing movement (my car) and settling on it. It also kept pace with being above my car as I moved until it settled on me. It was illuminated inside the car as well. Extremely unsettling.  What is even more unsettling is this was on Wednesday and after work I had an errand to run with a friend that was very memorable for the two of us and we took photos even. That night, I had a dream that was extremely vivid and detailed and it was a complete “re-do” of my Wednesday - I had slept in for my shift at work but still went in, worked a whole shift, had meaningful conversations with people, went home and napped on the couch. I woke up in bed then next day (Thursday) stunned by my dream. I usually do not dream at all. It could be a coincidence, or it could be a possible tampering of my conception of time and try to “replace” that day? I told the friend I went on the errand with about the spotlight as soon as it happened and then about the dream. They confirmed that Wednesday happened just as inexperienced (the spotlight in the morning and then the errand) and that I did not disappear. The photos we took are still on my phone, as is all my messages about the spotligh! t.  I am just so unsettled by the entire occurrence. I was absolutely being watched.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
