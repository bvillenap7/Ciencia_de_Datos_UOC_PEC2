4 non-flashing red lights in a diamond formation hovering above the Space Needle in Seattle-1971. ((NUFORC Note:  Pilot report.  PD));1971-06-30 23:30:00;30 minutes;4 non-flashing red lights in a diamond formation hovering above the Space Needle in Seattle-1971. I was flying for a regional air taxi out of Bremerton, Washington (flying cargo and passengers back and forth from Seattle/Tacoma Intl.  Airport (SEATAC) to Bremerton, Washington in the Summer of 1971.  I had just departed SEATAC headed West with a passenger in the back seat of my airplane when I looked out the right window towards downtown Seattle and saw 4 red non-blinking lights in a diamond formation over the Space Needle at my altitude.   I called Seattle Center to ask if they had anything on radar and was told they did not.  I then asked my passenger if he saw the lights and he said yes.  I asked him if he was in a hurry and he said he was not, so I called Seattle Center again and informed them that I would like to divert to investigate these lights over the Space Needle.   I made a right turn and headed for the Space Needle and the 4 red lights but the closer I got to the lights the more the lights moved upward in front of me.  I attempted to follow the lights but! at about 8000 feet these 4 lights simply vanished in front of me.  I then resumed my flight to Bremerton and have never been able to establish a good identification for these non-flashing, and seemingly connected, 4 red lights to this day.

Massive, fiery, black diamond with perfect straight edges hovers over hillside in Seattle;1997-11-14 21:00:00;5 minutes;Massive fiery black  diamond with perfect straight edges hovers over hillside in Seattle My volleyball team and I driving from Seattle Pacific University about 9 pm back to our hotel room.  There were about 14 of us in 3 different vehicles.  I'm not from the area, so couldn't say what road we were on, but coming from that college driving only about less than 10 minutes, when one of the girls says, Oh my God, what is that?  The tone in her voice had us all leaning to look out the right windows of our van.  The round was curving around a very big hill.  It was dark.  But when I looked up into the sky what I saw shocked and amazed and scared me. What I saw was this:  A large, so large it took up most of the sky, diamond-shaped UFO hovering, not moving, over this big hill right next to us.  We were right beside it.  It had 4 perfect edges to it, and all were touching.  It's hard to explain, but think if you will a black diamond cut from paper and holding a light behind it in an otherwise dark room.  It was illuminated from above. We were stuck to that window, and you could feel the fear from all.  I thought, This is it.  We are having contact, invasion.   It lasted only five minutes as we were still driving, and as we got further away, we couldn't pull over.  We were driving caravan with 2 other vehicles, and it was a busy road. When we got back to the hotel, the other two vehicles had seen it as well, and you can imagine the the excited conversation, so we all piled into one room and turned on the tv, only to wait until the very end of the segment for a 30 second blurb that it was space junk.  It was good enough for everyone I was with.  Coaches, too.  They all quickly dismissed it as space junk, while I was the ONLY one who quickly dismissed the space junk theory. Huge diamond shape object with 4 clearly distinguisable lines completely connected, and it looked like it had a orange fire above it.  It never moved. I've read a lot of the descriptions from this incident, and NONE of them sounds similar to what I experienced that night.  Who knows, there could have been multiple different UFO. But I will never, ever forget that night.  It's been 20 years. I will follow up with a map and drawing. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be both passionate in her description of the sighting, and sincere.  We suspect that she has reported accurately, and her report conforms to other accounts we've heard about the same incident.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

8-9 identical hovering, stationary objects with oscillating diamond shaped white light patterns. 70-100 feet above Seattle I-5 corridor;2001-04-27 21:55:00;10mins;8-9 identical hovering, stationary objects with oscillating diamond shaped white light patterns. 70-100 feet above Seattle I-5 corridor While driving northbound along the I5 corridor on Friday, April 27th, between Olympia and Bellingham, I passed through the city of Seattle.  It was 9:50pm.  As I reached the area adjacent to West Seattle, I spotted a light in the sky, which at first I took for an aircraft inbound to Boeing Field or Seatac Intl. Airport.  However, after less than a minute, I looked up again and noticed that the light had not moved and that I, rather, was moving toward this light which hovered midair above the neighborhood on the East side of the highway, approximately 70 to 100 feet up.  As I drove past the object, I looked at it through my sunroof and wondered if it was a helicopter.  I noticed the counter-clockwise cycling strobes of white lights tracing the pattern of a diamond under the craft while two or more other white lights glowed without flashing.  Moments later, I saw a second identical object on the same side of the highway less than 200 feet North of the original one.  As I scanned the skyline, I realized that two more identical stationary craft were hovering above the downtown area at approximately the same height.  After an accidental detour due to the distraction, at the James Avenue exit, I returned to the highway and proceeded toward the University District where I saw two more on my right (East) and another on my left which was moving.  I watched the moving object, which passed above me NW to SE about 100 feet up.  After it passed out of my field of vision, I watched another hovering, stationary craft with bright blue and red blinking lights remeniscent of a police light bar.  At this point I decided to pull over and get out of my vehicle when the next one came into view.  As I drove on, I did not witness any others.  At this time I switched on the Art Bell show, just beginning. Before the program, local KOMO Seattle news had nothing to report on the matter and Neither did Art Bell or his callers.  All of the craft, with the exception of one were identical and behaved like helicopters or Harrier jets.! Becaus e of their apparent size, I first believed the craft to be double rotor helicopters.  I looked around at other motorists driving beside me but there were no other noticeable witnesses.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Large diamond-shaped UFO with four round projections silently glides over downtown Seattle.;2002-08-09 02:22:00;90 seconds;Large diamond-shaped UFO with four round projections silently glides over downtown Seattle. At 2:20am, still not able to fall asleep after a night of shooting a documentary about my ((personal URL)) website, I decided to poke my head out the window to look for stray Persieds. After just two minutes of looking out into space (facing generally up and to the north), a large, very slow moving object caught my eye, emerging from the limb of a building rooftop to the NNE.  It was a dark grey in color, appeared to be more or less diamond-shaped, and it had four lighter colored spheres or disks on its underside.  The object was approximately the size of my thumbnail held at arm's length, so it was quite large and easily seen & tracked even though it did not have any lights on it.  It was moving very slowly from roughly NNE to SSW, curving slowly to the W as it passed nearly overhead and then headed out away from the city. It displayed a slow oscillating motion appearing to twist back and forth but with its movements limited to perhaps 10Â°, so the leading edge never became the trailing edge or vice versa.  The movements were very regular, like a cam on a slow-turning gearhead motor. It did not appear to emit any light of its own, nor did it emit any sounds that I could hear.  At first I thought I might have been witnessing a stealth aircraft of some type, but the very slow forward travel and the slight but noticeable oscillating motion ruled that out pretty quickly.  Birds in flight were also ruled out due to the very slow forward speed and the lack of flapping wings, which would have been visible on something of the same apparent size as what I saw. After viewing the object for perhaps 20 seconds, I stumbled into the next room and grabbed a pair of 10X50 binoculars, then went back to the window and tried to zoom in on it.  I lost 15-20 seconds of possible viewing time in getting the binoculars. By the time I had finally got myself up to the window and located the object again, it had dimmed substantially and moved out over Elliot Bay and I didn't see any more detail on it than I originally did with the naked eye.  After viewing the object in and out of binoculars for an addition 50-60 seconds, it faded from view though only due to lack of illumination as it flew away from the downtown Seattle core and out over water. It was still plenty large enough in the sky to see with the naked eye had there been more light. The color of the object body appeared to be a dark grey and the color of the four circular devices or projections on its underside appeared white or light grey the only source of light striking it was the sodium vapor lights reflected off the streets of Seattle.   Shape was that of a slightly elongated diamond with significantly rounded edges and the round or spherical projections were positioned just inside each apex of the diamond.  Of several unidentifieds I have witnessed in Seattle, this one had, by far, the largest apparent size of them all.  Its longer axis was more or less aligned with its plane of travel at all times. Actual size and altitude are difficult to determine as there are no clouds or other objects to use as a reference.  I would have to estimate the altitude to be 1,000 to 2,000 feet, and the object's size to be approximately 20' long by 15' wide. I'll try to depict what I saw in Photoshop and then email it to you.

Glowing white, diamond shaped object in the sky to the west , above Seattle slowly moving straight up.;2004-06-15 19:00:00;30 sec;Glowing white, diamond shaped object in the sky to the west , above Seattle slowly moving straight up. While at a traffic light in Seattle's Greenlake area I noticed a strange, misshapen, diamond like white light formation in the sky to the West. It's elevation was as high as any airplane I've seen in the sky, and size much bigger. Almost like someone had taken a razor and made a vertical cut in the skyline and light was bursting through the cut.  It seemed to moving slowly and steadily, straight upward. I watched it as long as my light lasted and around the corner, it did not appear to be going away anytime soon. Other people had to have seen it, I was surprised not to see news reports explaining it. Any idea what I saw? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a high-altitude contrail, illuminated by the setting sun.  Just a guess.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
4 glowing objects travel in formation over Puget Sound.;2010-07-08 22:44:00;6 minutes;4 glowing objects travel in formation over Puget Sound. At 10:40 PM, I was sitting on my balcony (which faces west towards Puget Sound) and saw a bright glowing object SW of the Space Needle.  It caught my attention due to the shape and intense light and did not look like any plane (I see planes every day from my view).  A second object, of the same shape and size, suddenly appeared next to it.  Then two more objects raised up (from what appeared to the water - Puget Sound) and they floated up in formation to where the other two objects were.  All 4 objects slowly raised up into the sky and totally out of view.  I was able to shoot several minutes of the last two objects with my video camera.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

4 bright triangular-shaped objects remaining in a triangular formation caught my attention over Lake Union in Seattle.;2014-09-04 21:15:00;4 minutes;4 bright triangular Shaped objects remaining in a triangular formation caught my attention over Lake Union in Seattle. To my pleasant surprise, just two months since my first UFO sighting over Lake Union in Seattle, I witnessed four unusual light shapes again tonight - very close to the same location they made their appearance in July.  What caught my eye this evening were 4 bright lights slightly north east of the Space Needle from my vantage point where I was gazing south toward the Space Needle. Each object appeared triangular shaped with lights at each point. However, it seemed there was a light in the center of each as well.  They struck me initially as probably being lanterns, though unusually shaped if in fact lanterns.  As I kept my eye on them they did not seem to characterize lanterns floating through the air due to their tight triangular formation while moving upward then sideways in perfect synchronicity.  One object was positioned to the left of the other three in their triangular formation.  The object on the left from my view faded within approximately 20 seconds after I first spotted them all. I snapped a 26 second video, then two photos of the remaining three objects from my iPhone while standing on my front deck then lost view as they moved further east and were hidden behind a neighboring building.  I ran through my house and up my dock to zoom in on them once again.  I was able to snap two more photos, though they did not appear clearly in the brighter light from this angle.  They seemed to turn southward and disappeared within about 20 more seconds from my new viewing spot. Following their disappearance there was a single helicopter hovering over the middle of Lake Union facing the direction these objects had been seen. I will include the video clip and the original two photos that are the most clear I was able to capture. ((NUFORC Note:  Second similar sighting by the same witness over Lake Union.
