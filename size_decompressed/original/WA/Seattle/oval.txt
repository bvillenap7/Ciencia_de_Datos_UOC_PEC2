Three objects over downtown Seattle, early morning;1997-02-09 13:45:00;4 minutes;Three objects over downtown Seattle, early morning At 3:45 am I awoke to my roommate’s voice. He said, Get up and go look up into the sky.  My roommate, who was laying on a futon stretched out in the living with his head facing the window, sounded calm but I heard a sense of urgency in his voice. It scared me. I stumbled towards the third floor window of my downtown Seattle apartment overlooking the Westin Hotel.  For some reason, I was unable to stand up, so I kneeled at the windowsill, and looked up into the sky.  I immediately saw 3 shiny, round white blobs of light darting around in very erratic patterns above Elliott Bay.  As I was watching, my roommate said in an equally sickly calm voice, I have been in the military for over 20 years, and nothing, nothing we have can make those moves.  Then he rolled slightly on his side, smiled, closed his eyes and started snoring. Within about 4 minutes of his passing out, I remember stumbling about 3 feet towards the couch and nothing after that.  The objects were shiny, white, and flying slightly lower than cloud level.  I had some difficulty focusing on them. In the distance they looked to be about the size of a Volkswagen beetle.  The most remarkable aspect of these objects was their flying patterns, which defied gravity.  Each of the three objects I observed were moving in straight lines and then quickly shooting off at right angles very, very fast. Much faster than I have ever seen anything mechanical move. I don’t see how a human body could take that kind of movement.  They also moved in close proximity to each other, which appeared equally as dangerous.  Their flying pattern reminded me of fireflies, and it looked they were playing in the clouds.  I can only say this is not something I have ever witnessed before. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

light moving east to west;1999-01-14 21:50:00;3-4secs;light moving east to west Around 2150, 14Jan99, I was watching aircraft in their approach pattern to SeaTac International Airport.  The approach was from the north to the south.  I was watching a Boeing 737 on final when I saw a traffic signal green in color light directly over head.  The conditions were, light s/w winds, overcast sky.  The approaching aircraft were below the cloud base.  The light apeared to either be in the clouds or was bright enough to shine thru them (as a car head light would shine thru fog). The light was about the size of a pencil eraser and had difussed light around it about twice it's size.  I first observed the light at about 90 degrees above me and watched until about 30 degres to my front. The light was traveling on a 270 degree (west/true not magnetic) compass reading. The light did not fade out it just went out like a light would go out if you turned off a switch.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Over downtown, driving north on 1st ave, the object moved over the 2000 block buildings.;1999-05-01 10:55:00;4 seconds;Over downtown, driving north on 1st ave, the object moved over the 2000 block buildings. My fiancee and I saw the craft, which was ovalish, move directly over buildings in downtown Seattle and out of view. When we got to the other side of the building, it was gone. The sighting lasted only a few seconds, but it was long enough to know it was not a conventional craft. It looked like the crafts in the Mexico City sightings. Metalic body with a dark stripe running through the middle. There was no noise, like you would expect from a conventional aircraft. It was 100-125 feet above the skyline, and at arm's length my thumb would cover it.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Shiny gold/black large balloon like object travelling up Puget Sound WA w/ consistent altitude;2000-10-27 10:30:00;30 seconds;Shiny gold/black large balloon like object travelling up Puget Sound WA w/ consistent altitude What at first seemed like a wayward balloon, when viewed through a strong scope, was a watermelon shaped object, with a shining gold top half and black bottom half with a distinct demarkation horizontally across it. Viewed from a bluff overlooking the sound, it seemed to be quite a distance from shore. I watch this view for quite a few hours a day, and see all variety of birds and am usually fairly accurate in judging distance from shore. at least a quarter mile or more offshore. It seemed to be drifting from south to north at an even elevation of about 400-500 feet (?), and moving more quickly than the shore breeze. After about 20 seconds it started rising from its flat path at about 60 degrees from the horizon and disappeared from my sight.  This all on a bright sunny day with clear visibility. If indeed it was a balloon, it was very large. I have seen adrift balloons let loose from the shoreline here before, and this was indeed out over the sound at some distance, and too large to be a typical balloon. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to be both sincere, and quite serious-minded.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Large white sphere floating between clouds near Boeing field..;2002-05-30 08:15:00;1-2 minutes;Large white sphere floating between clouds near Boeing field.. As I was driving north on Airport Way S. I witnessed one very large oval shaped sphere with what appeared to be a small triangular tail wing on the back and a small dark oval shape on the surface. The object was floating slowly from behind one cloud into another, and although it was overcast I could see a bit of the sun shining on this creme/white frosty surface. It seemed too big and round to be a blimp,I knew right away that it was something I've never seen before, it made no sound. Can someone tell me if what I saw sounds like an experimental craft that maybe NASA or Boeing is working on? Before I could think about pulling over to really look at this thing, it disappeared into a cloud and was gone..;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Oval craft seen flying over Lake Washington on 01/11/04 at 4:00 pm.;2004-01-11 16:00:00;20 seconds;Oval craft seen flying over Lake Washington on 01/11/04 at 4:00 pm. I was watching television on the second floor of my house in Rainier Beach neighborhood.The television is placeed in front of a window that looks out towards the northeast. As I watched, a object flew view. I noticed it right away because it was so bright. Also, the 5 seconds I saw it, I couldnt tell it was any vehicle I knew that flew. I ran downstairs and out to the front porch to see if I could continue to see the craft. The craft was visible for about 15 seconds more before it flew behind some trees. I was flying a northwest direction towards downtown Seattle. It was over Lake Washington for the time I witnessed it.  It was partly cloudy, but the sun was bright in the west about 30 minutes before setting, so it was very bright. The craft was oval as I could tell and silver in color. What cought my eye was the very bright white lights on the bottom of the craft. Ther were two lights on the bottom pulsing left to right and back again. I have never seen a light so bright on any craft except a large airliner that is coming straight at you, but this craft was flying diagnally away from me.  After the craft went behind some trees, I saw a sesna flying about the same elevation and distance in the western sky. I think there is a great chance that pilot saw the object I saw. I think that plane was going to land at Boeing field. I hope some other people saw this because it was so bright that time of day and the lights on the craft were so bright. Also the area I live in is densely populated and some had to be looking up besides me. There was absolutly no sound that came from the craft either, which was very weird. The area I saw it in is also not a flight path for aircraft.  I work for a horticultural company on Mercer Island as supervisor to exterior installs. I have a bach. in plant science from the University of Idaho. I am 39 years old.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Large burnt-orange object hanging low in the sky near Downtown Seattle.;2008-04-13 03:00:00;1 min;Large burnt-orange object hanging low in the sky near Downtown Seattle. A friend and I were on the top floor (4th story) of my house, talking and smoking cigarettes out the window which faces west-- just north of Downtown Seattle. The sky was clear. As we looked to the north-west, near the Ballard area, we both observed a very large burnt-orange object slightly above the the skyline, about 3 to 4 miles away. The object was glowing and almost looking like a full moon that was on fire. Slightly above and to the north was another light that moved in slow, tight turns very close to the larger object. After about 45 seconds, the object began to change shape, it became more compact, almost as if it was flying away from us, and in less than 10 seconds, it was gone. There was nothing left behind in the sky. After experiencing that, my friend and I tried to think of every option of what it could have been and still cannot come to any conclusions. After posting a bulletin asking if anyone else had seen the object, a friend who lives in the area said he heard a loud electric/static sound and flashing orange lights out his window. Although he did not see anything, he says it seems as though a nearby house was on fire and there were lots of emergency vehicles with flashing lights, then suddenly disappeared  and the sound was gone.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
A glowing orange elongated orb was seen by 2 men to be moving swiftly over Seattle, Washington during daylight.;2009-02-25 15:17:00;1 minute;A glowing orange elongated orb was seen by 2 men to be moving swiftly over Seattle, Washington during daylight. Two retired gentlemen, aged 60 and 63, the former a retired Boeing engineer, were playing a game of Carcassonne on Wednesday, February 25th, 2009, while sitting in a glassed-in breakfast nook in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.   At about 5:17 pm, Harvey noticed a strange moving bright light and brought it to Steve's attention.  Quickly, they stepped onto the deck and both observed the object for about a minute, sharing a pair of Bushnell 7x35 binoculars for a closer look. The object, about 35 degrees above the horizon, appearing bigger than a star or planet but smaller than the moon, was moving quickly and soundlessly on a level path from south to north, eventually disappearing behind a cloud.  The object was orange in color, glowing softly in the setting sun, and was shaped like a slightly elongated ball or globe, although rounder on the top and flatter on the bottom.  No empennage or other features were noted.  There was some kind of secondary motion seen, as if the object might have been pulsating or rotating.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

3 bright orange oval objects floating slowly overhead then slowly disappearing one by one;2009-07-04 23:00:00;3 minutes;3 bright orange oval objects floating slowly overhead then slowly disappearing one by one Seattle WA on July 4th 2009 at around 11PM    We were walking North on Woodland Ave after viewing the fireworks at Gasworks Park. We noticed 3 bright orange, oval shaped objects in the sky.  They were the size of short grained rice and they were a fist length apart.  They were glowing and illuminated. They were traveling horizontaly from North to South at a slow pace going into the horizon at an incline slower than an airplane and faster than a satelitte. They were almost directly over us to the west.  We were in a neighborhood mixed with residential and industrial buildings. The middle light seemed to rise above the others, then the 1st object, the one on the far left faded, diminshed and disappeared the other two did the same into the same spot. From the moment we discovered the objects, it took about 3 minutes for them to pass over and disappear.  They travelled about 8 fists across the sky. Soon after about 1-2 minutes later a commercial airplane flew above the objects path going in the opposite direction (North).;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Oval craft seen flying over lake washington towards Seattle.;2012-12-01 11:35:00;1 minute;Oval craft seen flying over lake washington towards Seattle. I was driving east across the I-90 bridge over lake washington.  I was looking left because there was a giant rainbow that was terminating somewhere near the middle of the lake on the eastern shore.   Flying slowly from East to West, north of both bridges i could see a shiny round object slowly making it's way across the sky.  I am very good at identifying planes, but this shape was not identifiable as traditional air plane.  I could not see any wings or anything that looked like a nose or a tail of the plane.  I'm not sure if it was light grey, or just was just shiny and reflecting what light was there.  I can't have been the only person to see this craft.   Everyone on the i90 bridge at that time would have noticed the giant rainbow and then maybe seen the same craft.  I would love to hear from anyone who might have seen it from the 520 bridge, so i can pin point where exactly it was.   If it was flying between the too bridges then i'd say it was not a very large craft.  It was north of the 520 bridge it might have been very large.   Also this craft was not on any of the usual flight paths for the seattle area.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Two large, brightly lit oval disks seen from West Seattle South over Puget Sound;2013-07-22 20:50:00;6-9 minutes;Two large, brightly lit oval disks seen from West Seattle South over Puget Sound On the evening of July 22nd I was on the deck of our home in West Seattle and my husband was upstairs.  Our home sits facing south on the cliff above Puget Sound at an elevation of 328 feet.  It was 8:50 PM and the sun was setting. I looked out across Puget Sound to the south past Lincoln Park toward Tacoma and saw two large, hovering, rotating, oval-shaped crafts with very bright white lights that were flashing and twinkling. They were in formation and the one to the right looked to be further away.  From my vantage point, they were about ¾ the size of a full moon or larger.  Standing in the exact location if I extend my first finger the objects were as wide as my nail and ½  to ¾ of the length of the nail.  Based on the altitude and the jet planes I see daily on the flight path I estimated that 3-4 large passenger jets could have fit inside. The lights were significantly brighter than the West Seattle-Vashon ferry which was traversing below (east to west) as well as the lights on the jet plane that was traveling south on the flight path (to the southwest) and the red aviation towers that are visible to the southwest of our house.  They looked like light reflecting off a diamond on a much larger scale. The location was just to the right (west and south) of Lincoln Park from my view and just above the land on the horizon. I could hear the jet and the disks/ ovals were noiselessly hovering and rotating slowly. I quickly got my binoculars and observed a dark black outline of the oval disks.  There were no wings, no propellers, and no landing gear with very bright light radiating from the center. I watched them for 3-5 minutes at which point the one to the right began to tip and turn to the left slowly like it was going to leave.  I could see the dark underside which was oval shaped.  As it turned, the bright light faced to the southeast but I couldn’t see the other side of it, just the underside which appeared black. I went upstairs and handed the binoculars to my husband who then watched them for 3-5 minutes.  He attempted a picture through the binoculars with his iPhone but the resolution was not good enough.  Each disk slowly tipped to the right and departed to the southwest, slowly disappearing from sight.  As they turned the lights shone the other direction and the disks appeared black. I’ve lived and worked as an acupuncturist in Puget Sound for 17 years and have never seen anything like this. I have sat on my deck or near our many south facing windows for the last 2.5 years and am familiar with all the Sea-Tac airport traffic, military planes and helicopters, have seen meteors and comets, but I have never seen anything like this.  The aircraft technology was more advanced than I have ever witnessed.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

While walking across the parking lot I noticed 12-15 craft in the northerly direction  (But, it was just east of Boeing Field in Seattle, WA).   I immediately pulled out my cell phone and began recording...I do actually have live footage of this event.  The craft were exactly what was seen over PHX in 1996, but there were just more of them and they were in a different formation.   I called my roommate to come outside to witness this event and there was another older gentleman that lives in the building that was standing shoulder to shoulder with me watching this event.  There was another cluster of 2 or 3 people in the parking lot at time as well.  However, as the craft traveled easterly at a slow pace, at one particular spot or location in the sky the craft would disappear as if they were enter a doorway or portal.  The craft did not change their formation to enter this doorway or portal...when they reach the precise spot in the sky they all just disappeared. Following this event, I contact Boeing Tower, Seattle-Tacoma Tower, and a local news station and no other observations or reports were made of this event.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I was pulling up to a stoplight and the light was turning red.  If I wasn't looking up at the traffic light I would have missed this.  It was lit up and moving low and fast.  Maybe 200-300 ft up (or less) and at a slight angle downward.   I thought it was a helicopter at first, but by the time my brain told me so this thing was gone out of sight.

Blue Oval Lightship;2019-03-17 05:20:00;1 minute;Blue Oval Lightship Just below Ursa Major I saw a strange light that was moving very slowly, it then stopped.  A few seconds later it got really bright and flashed a blue light.  It sat there for another couple seconds and then started moving again in a different direction.  It repeated a larger blue flash this time and then seemed to have took off at a rapid speed.  The object was blue in color and oval.  This is not the first time I have seen this Blue Light Ship, it happens frequently. I would say at the very least I see the red basketball size orbs twice a week over Magnolia, Seattle.

Glowing ovals seen in South Seattle possibly over Bremerton;2020-02-14 17:55:00;~5 minute;Glowing ovals seen in South Seattle possibly over Bremerton I was looking out my living room window and noticed two lights I thought may have been aircraft. After a couple of minutes I felt somewhat confident that these were not regular aircraft. It was dark and relatively clear out. I noticed t them at first because of where their location and secondly because of their bright greenish glow without typical blinking running lights. My view is looking west over the south of downtown Seattle area toward west Seattle. There are many aircraft in the area because of Sea-Tac, Boeing field, King County airport, and the medical emergency helicopters. The two UFOs caught my attention because they were flying over what I estimate possibly the Bremerton area which is not really part of the local flight path and for their flight pattern. I believe they were meandering in what looked like more northern direction when I first noticed them. Then one or both seemed to change direction and eventually cross paths one above the other as! shown in the video, which is also unusual. I got my camera as soon as determined them to be unusual. I had a trouble getting them in focus. The entire time they flew slowly and they didn’t seem to be on a linear path. They simply disappeared. They looked rather large but it’s difficult to determine their size and their location. Their altitude looked to be at or around the altitude of a helicopter or other low flying aircraft. The closer hill in the video is west Seattle, using that as a reference I would estimate them somewhere in the Bremerton area or possible further west, and their size to be at least the size of a helicopter if not lager. Obviously at this distance and being in a major metro area there were no other qualities to the sighing such as sound, smell, heat, etc. No exhaust was noticeable.  The light they emitted did have a very interesting glow without glare.  The color was at first a pleasant bright off-white and seemed to take on a more green hue. The red! lights seen on the video were too small to see with the naked! eye.  I am not certain these are UFOs but if they seemed to be unconventional aircraft.

Large low flying craft over Seattle just barely visible to the eye due to light pollution that did not look, move, or sound normal;2020-02-21 01:35:00;1-2 minutes;Large low flying craft over Seattle just barely visible to the eye due to light pollution that did not look, move, or sound normal I have never done anything like this, but this experience was so crazy that I can’t stop thinking about it and I need to have some kind of solid documentation for what I saw.  I went to bed last night (Feb 20, 2020) at 1:00am (so I guess Feb 21, 2020 to be exact). I am 100% certain on the time because I remember thinking to myself “wow it’s exactly 1:00am” when I looked at my phone and decided to then go to bed. I fell asleep pretty fast, quicker than usual, although that part makes sense because I had to get up early that day and I also went to the gym so I was very tired. At this point, I need to describe my room for this story to make sense.  My bed is in the corner of my room against two windows.  The top of my head faces the larger window (the direction the sun usually comes from in the morning), and either my face or my back (depending on which direction I lay) faces the other smaller window. There is a small piece of wall where these two windows meet in the corner. I included a drawing for reference. The next thing I remember after falling asleep was that my eyes flew open and I sat up. This also isn’t too uncommon for me - it happens because something wakes me up, usually the sun coming over the mountain and directly into my open window onto my face. However, I was surprised to look out my window and see that it was still very dark out, though I was sure it must have been at least 5am. This is when I saw that something was off. I noticed the outline of a structure in the sky, and when I saw it I also found that it had several very faint lights on the bottom. Normally when you hear about UFOs you hear about lights and stuff, and I always imagined them to be very bright, but it was as if they had a dimmer switch and were just barely visible if you were looking very hard. The craft was oddly shaped, it had smooth and cubic edges and sides, and was mostly in an oval shape. It was moving by pretty slowly, but by the time I recognized what I was seeing it had flown upwards an! d disappeared. If it had been any darker, or if the craft had been flying any higher, I wouldn't have seen anything at all. It was just BARELY visible. Honestly the only reason I saw it at all was because there is so much light pollution in Seattle where I was. It also appeared to be MASSIVE showing that it was lowflying. I should also note that I live directly under a flight path, so I see planes and other aircrafts all day long, but NOTHING like this. It also made absolutely no sound, which anyone living under a flightpath knows is highly unusual. The size, oddness in shape and movement, as well as lack of sound all show to me that this either was not human, or if it was it is something that is kept away from the public. I also want to note that when I first saw it, I thought that maybe my window was reflecting something (combined with my post sleep haze) that made it look as if I was seeing an aircraft. However, to make sure what I was seeing was truly possible, I moved ! my head around to make sure the lights stayed in the correct p! osition and continued to move, and I also looked out both windows and saw the craft pass from one to the other behind the section of my wall between them: in conclusion, I wasn’t seeing things, or if I was my imagination in vividly detailed. The final description I want to give is that when it disappeared, the night seemed to swallow it, as if it was moving into fog. Again, it was already just barely visible if you looked very hard, so when it moved upwards just slightly it instantly was too dark to see it. I really wish I was able to get a picture, but it took me so long to register what I was seeing that by the time I thought about pulling out my phone it had gone. I feel kind of dumb because I always joke about how people can never document werid stuff like this, but now I understand. Oh and when I checked the time immediately after so that I could remember when it happened, it was 1:37am, so only a half an hour had passed from when I fell asleep, even though I felt like hours ha! d passed. I’m not really sure what to do with this info, hence why I'm posting it here. But maybe someone else also had a similar experience?;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
