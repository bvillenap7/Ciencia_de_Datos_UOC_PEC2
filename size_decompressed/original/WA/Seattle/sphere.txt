Looking through the fluid the stars behind it were greatly magnified. I was on a long flight back to Los Angeles on Pan Am's Clipper Class 747. We took the polar route over Canada, Seattle, and the Pacific coast. Looking out the window, I could see the stars shining brightly in the pre-dawn skies.  I could even see what I initially thought was the planet Jupiter glowing orange in the distance.  I then began to think that it could not be Jupiter, because it was not in this part of the sky.  It must be something else.  Sure enough, the object was moving along side of the plane.  A big orange ball!.  Judging from the time remaining for us to land, we were somewhere over Seattle.   The object was moving from right to left and then right again.  I then saw beneath it a stream of fluid along its path.  Looking through the fluid, I could see the stars behind it were greatly magnified. After about ten minutes of this, I decided to try and take a picture of this object.  But since I had only a cheap instamatic camera and it was night, I knew that the picture would not come out.  But I too k the picture anyway. Soon thereafter, the object came straight towards our plane and I could sense the plane turning aggressively as if to avoid something. The object disappeared behind the plane's tail and I never saw it again.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Dimly lit group of colored objects hovering over the Woodland Park Zoo emitting light beams similar to spotlights.;1996-11-07 23:30:00;7 sec.;SUMMARY:  Dimly lit group of colored objects hovering over the Woodland Park Zoo emitting light beams similar to spotlights. I was walking my dogs with a friend in the park adjacent to the zoo it was a lull in the heavy rain.  We walked into a parking lot to use the tunnel on the way home.    As we emerged from the trees my friend pointed upwards.  Just above the zoo, 400 yards from the parking lot were the four shapes in the sky:  two faint blue spheres moving back and forth like in vibration as a pair.   Closer to us was a cylindrical object the same width of the spheres, and length three times the diameter (1x3), emitting a rose colored tint.  The closest object was a larger sphere emitting a deep maroon glow.   The three (four) objects hovered back and forth independently, while their lights seemed to engulf them and be focused towards the ground at the same time.   After a few second of looking at these objects and being in awe the purple sphere became bright to the point neither of us could look any longer and were forced to look down.   When I looked up again there was nothing.   My friend then saw nothing.  My dogs did not seem to notice anything.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
SEATTLE sighting. During daytime same day of the phoenix lights;1997-03-13 13:30:00;15-20 seconds;SEATTLE sighting. During daytime same day of the phoenix lights I saw a round silver craft from my former work location which sets on a hill west of Boeing air field. From my vantage point I look east over the airport. I was sitting in my truck during my lunch brake. I was watching a small plane making an approach towards boeing field. It was a split second later that a spherical craft passed the plane in the opposite direction. This craft was moving at a very high rate of speed. I did not take my eyes from it, I thought it would dissappear at any moment. To my disbelief the craft made a sudden turn west towards my location. The day was sunny and mostly clear with some clouds. When this thing came over, once again I thought it was going to be gone. It was very quick and the craft started to dance in the sky. It litterally stopped to change directions and went east to west up and down (diagonally). I would guess the average travel distance was about one half mile per each direction change. Each traveled distance was done a second or so. It actually would at times pause in and out of the single cloud that was in that area. It went in the cloud, and when I thought it was gone it would pop out somewhere else. The craft finally left. I am surprised not to see any other reports in my area, but I am convinced that I would not have even been aware of this if I had not been focused on the aircraft that it intersected. I would like to talk to anyone who also experienced a local sighting that day.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
We watched approximately 15 dimly lit white spheres that pulsed brightly together in different colors while slowly rising towards the s;1998-03-13 21:50:00;3 - 4 minutes;We watched approximately 15 dimly lit white spheres that pulsed brightly together in different colors while slowly rising towards the sky My girlfriend and I were staying at the Marriott Residence Inn on the evening of March 13th 1998 in the city of Tukwila Washington just south and east of Seattle. At very close to 9:50pm as we were walking around the hotel complex (to get some exercise) we spotted something very strange just north and west and maybe 45 degrees up in the sky from our location. It appeared to be a tight cluster of very dimly lit white spheres that were rising out in the distance (south and maybe west of downtown Seattle near SeaTac Airport). The cluster was slowly rising straight up in the air over a period of about 4 minutes. The entire cluster also pulsed a total of three times within about a minute and a half of first spotting them while they were rising.  Even though the objects were a dimily lit white, they pulsed in very bright colors (mostly red) and at exactly the same time. They were also moving around in their tight cluster in such a way that made the whole of the objects seem to change shape and sort of wave around in the sky. Although it appeared to be just to the east of SeaTac Airport we had been watching most of the airplane activity in the area and this was nothing even comparable to any air activity that I had ever seen in my life! The cluster continued to rise until it climbed up into some higher cloud cover and we couldn't see it anymore. I'm really curious if any one has ever seen such a site especially in the Seattle area?;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Six to 7 spheres about 10 ft. in diameter, luminescent white, appearing just inside cloud cover.  They were directly over, or just east of, the Fremont Bridge.  They were traveling from east to west, at an altitude of 400 to 500 ft. (est.), and at a velocity of 250 to 300 mph (est.).  I witnessed them long enough to know that they were not geese or human aircraft.  I heard no sound.  Just thought you would like to know. ((NUFORC Note:  Text of written report submitted to NUFORC.

I was looking up at the quarter moon and the very bright star next to it, looked very beautiful, clear skies no clouds whatsoever. I was facing SW and out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright purple sphere that looked very far away come in a perfectly straight line across the sky. Went just under the moon and continued in a perfectly straight line moving at about well if I put a measuring tape up in front of me to use as a guide I would have to say it moved across that measureing tape about 1 to 2 feet per second in a perfectly straight line. I have never seen anything like it. I was out with a friend and there were several other people there as well that saw the object move across the sky and to my surprise 2 of them said, oh we see stuff like that all the time. I am originally from South FL now a transplant to the area and have been looking up for 30 years and never saw anything like that. But I can tell you that after I saw this purple glowing sphere move across the sky the way it did and it looked very far away I became a believer that we are not alone. I had been listening to the Art Bell show ever since I moved to the west coast and stumbled on his program and have been hooked ever since and when I heard this info on the Art Bell show tonight and I have access to a computer at home now I decided to send this report in. Thankyou and I hope it helps in your cause. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Observed a round, metallic object proceeding west or SW at apparent high rate of speed--object appeared to dissappear after 3-5 seconds;2000-10-06 10:50:00;3-5 seconds;Observed a round, metallic object proceeding west or SW at apparent high rate of speed--object appeared to dissappear after 3-5 seconds I was travelling southbound on I-5 at about 1050 hrs.  Sky was absolutely clear with bright sunshine.   I glanced into the sky and observed a small metallic spherical or disk shaped object moving at what appeared to be fairly high speed to the west or southwest.  The object was at about 30-35 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be about the size of the head of a stick pin held out at arms length.  I observed it to move about an inch and 1/2 if my fingers are held out at arms length.  It also appeared to be rising slightly as it moved.  I blinked and it was gone.  I did not really observe it dissappearing, but I pulled over and scrutinized the sky for about two minutes and did not sight it again.  The object appeared to be a good distance away from me, but I cannot estimate the distance or altitude.   I'm a professional geologist employed by a local county and am trained in various remote sensing techniques.  My job requires that I be very  observant while in the outdoors and that I be able to estimate distances.   I've always believed that there is something to the UFO phenomenon and I've looked nearly all my life for one.  This is the first time that I've actually seen something that I could not otherwise explain.  I've been initially fooled (and excited) by aircraft and rubber and mylar balloons in the past, but I've always been able to identify them as objects of common occurence.  This was entirely different -- I even felt that something unusual was going on, though I can't put my finger on what that something was.   In any event, I'll be interested to see if anyone else observed the object and if, in fact, it was identified as an aircraft, balloon, etc.  Thanks;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I looked up and saw a object, very quiet, and I was wondering what kinda plane would be so quiet.  Not only so quiet, but also, very close to the ground.  The more I thought about it the more I realized it wasn't a plane at all, and I can only guess that it was a UFO.  It went south about a block, turned around, went in a circle like, and then came towards me.  Stopped, then took off north and disappeared.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Pulsating sphere hovers and then disappears;2001-06-25 16:30:00;2 -3 minutes;Pulsating sphere hovers and then disappears I was outdoors watching the clouds during a breezy day.  While looking up, I noticed a black spot high in the sky.  I assumed it was a balloon, but when I realized it was sitting stationary while the clouds were moving past it, I reached over for my binoculars.  Through the binoculars, the object appeared as a shiny silver metallic sphere that seemed to pulsate.  It began to move against the wind current, pulsated for a few moments while it hovered in the same spot, and then suddenly disappeared.  I've never seen a balloon pulsate and hover, so I figured I'd report this event.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Three dimly self-illuminated orange orbs travelling due West over Seattle;2002-02-02 03:30:00;15 seconds;Three dimly self-illuminated orange orbs travelling due West over Seattle There were four of us who were gathering together that evening for a man's night out movie marathon in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle. After watching four straight episodes of a Quartermass series (ironically), it was getting really late and we decided to break up the party. Around 3:30 am we gathered in the street to leave, when one witness needed to go back inside to get something. When he returned, the second witness began telling me a story of an encounter he had had recently (more irony). As he was telling the story, the third witness looked up and said, Look, a UFO. The four of us looked straight up and saw three dimly lit glowing orange orbs moving from East to West overhead. The details are as follows: The orbs (or disks) appeared to be self illuminated, but not very bright, like a candle flame through a transparent orange balloon which was a different colored orange than the city-light reflections on the clouds. They were traveling directly above us, just below the spotty checkerboard of cumulus clouds, which were estimated to be about 1500-2000 feet high, and the moon was directly south of us at about 65 degree angle from the southern horizon (my estimate). The two outer orbs (north and south)were flying in a straight vector, while the middle orb was playfully zigzagging between the other two, yet more closely to the northern-most orb. There was no sound as they passed over. Myself and another witness watched the objects the longest as they passed behind a nearby building, which obscured our view at about a 45 degree angle from our viewpoint. After witnessing these objects we had ruled out these objects as being seagulls, common to this area, as there were no signs of wing-flapping, the objects were not oval-shaped as a seagull's body would be and the maneuvering of the middle object was to fast and erratic for a bird. Seagulls and other birds tend to make sounds when flying as well. After talking about this between a couple of us later, we did not seem to surprised by what we saw, nor disturbed. It just seemed to cap off a perfect evening. Though one witness referred to these objects as piloted craft, my gut was telling me critter, as if they were some yet unclassified self-illuminating lifeform.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I was standing outside my house.  I live under a flight path, so am usually looking up in the sky.  Something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye and I happened to look at the roof of our house facing east.  About 2 inches (to the naked eye) above my roof traveling north to south in a perfectly straight line was a bluish orb/sphere followed by a trail of white light (about an inch in perspective).  It moved quickly - faster than any plane I've seen flying over (in a few seconds it traveled the length of my house and beyond), and was much larger than any of the planes that have passed overhead without also hearing them.  This was silent.  After a few seconds it faded quickly & disappeared like it had passed into clouds.  However, Sunday night was a perfectly clear evening, and I watched for some time afterward to see if I caught it again.  I am reporting this because it was truly inexplicable, and unlike anything else I've seen.  And I've been going out there every night for the last three years.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I’m a 30yr old woman. I consider myself spiritual but not religious. I’m an artist, who loves to meditate. I have a strong intuition, and consider myself an open minded person. I have felt that we are not alone on this planet my entire life. However, I never had an experience like the one I’m about to share with the National UFO reporting center.  Last night at around 11:50pm my partner and I were looking out of our window, which faces west when we saw something in the sky. It seemed pretty close to the horizon, but also seemed pretty far away. I can’t say how far the object was. The object in question was a spherical light, which started off a bit dull and muted, and quickly brightened. At its brightest it looked as though it were spinning, or had spinning lights.  It then turned an orange-red color and disappeared. A few minutes later it reappeared in a different spot. It started off dull and then brightened just like the first time. Then turned red and disappeared again. Over the next half hour it disappeared and reappeared six different times. Each time it seemed to be moving west to northwest.  The sphere and light was mostly white, and only changed to red prior to disappearing. Although at one point as we watched it spin, I saw some blue-green color. We stopped watching at 12:18am and went to bed. I don’t know what we saw, but it was an unidentified flying object. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a sighting of Venus would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses observed anything unusual.

Fast moving lights over Seattle;2008-04-25 21:30:00;1-1.5 hrs;Fast moving lights over Seattle 	Last Friday, April 25, 2008, at or around 9:00 pm I was in the back yard glassing the sky with a Gen 3 NVD.  While out, I saw planes, birds and many satellites, some that could be seen with the naked eye as well as some that could not.  All of a sudden while facing south, positioned around 10:30-11:00 in the sky, and to my left, I witnessed two objects traveling north.  The field of view for this device is 40 degrees and the device has no magnification.  The objects appeared to be about the same brightness as a satellite when seen through the device, yet could not be viewed at all without it.  The objects were approximately 1/8 inch apart when viewed through the lens.  They were traveling in a Delta, lead/wingman profile, and moved both fast and in a deliberate manner.  At about 12 O-clock in the sky, the object in the rear and right of the front object took an abrupt turn, heading 90 degrees to the right, disappearing over the building to my left.  This entire event took place in about 5-7 seconds.  Later, timing of satellites traveling in approximately the same direction took a voice count of about 60-80 one thousands to travel the same distance. 	After this sighting, I went inside to tell my girlfriend about it.  She thought I was kidding her.  I went back outside and within 15 minutes I saw what appeared to be the same objects traveling south, in the same fast, deliberate manner, again, oriented in the same manner to one another and again bright as a satellite through the lens, but not visible to the naked eye.  I went inside again and this time was able to convince my girlfriend to come have a look.  I believe we were outside less than 15 minutes when she saw the same objects and within a matter of what felt like minutes saw them again.  After she went inside, I witnessed them one more time, again traveling north to south, same configuration, same speed.  I am not sure whether said objects were emitting light or reflecting light my feeling is that they were reflecting light.  I would approximate the whole chain of events to have happened in at the utmost 1 to 1 1/2 hours time.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Orange glowing sphere, vanishes above Fourth of July crowd in Seattle.;2009-07-04 21:50:00;One minute;Orange glowing sphere, vanishes above Fourth of July crowd in Seattle. While outside of Seattle's Gasworks Park waiting for the fireworks to start, I noticed a spherical orange ball floating high above the lake.  It glowed orange from within, and bobbed along moving from North to South.  I pointed it out to my friend with me, and at least one other person next to me looked up and saw it to. It stopped, held its position for a few seconds then began to rise straight up. It disappeared in about 10-seconds.  What is bizarre though, is there were NO clouds in the sky.  The orange glowing ball just faded completely like going into cloaking mode.

Orange balls of light in Seattle night sky on July 17, 2010 at 11:37pm;2010-07-17 23:37:00;10 minutes;Orange balls of light in Seattle night sky on July 17, 2010, at 11:37pm My wife and I were watching television when we noticed our our bedroom window about 30 orange lights floating in the night sky over Seattle (we live in South Seattle, on a hill with a partial view of downtown).  The lights were orange and of various sizes.   My wife dismissed them as airplanes queuing up to land but they were out of the normal staging area and anyway, airplanes don't bunch up in clusters to land.   We watched them for about 10 minutes as they floated from east (direction of Puget Sound) toward downtown and then drifted upwards into the clouds and disappeared.   They lasted longer than a firework remains lit, but their motion seemed more determined by air currents than locomotion.  They didn't all appear at once, but rather, appeared one after another, twinkling into being, drifting from east to west, and then uplifting into the clouds.  No idea what they were.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Orange glowing orbs over Seattle July 4th 2012;2012-07-04 23:00:00;5 minutes;Orange glowing orbs over Seattle July 4th 2012 Time: Roughly 11PM PST for the first sighting. 11:20PM PST for second sighting:  There were large crowds gathered in the area for the 4th of July fireworks show at Lake Union downtown Seattle.  The first time we saw it was about 10 minutes after the fireworks display had ended.  There were still people launching fireworks from houses nearby but this was not any kind of firework.  We were outside on a friends deck when I noticed a glowing flickering orb parallel to our position at a 45 degree angle. The object appeared to be about a 1/2 mile away at the time moving maybe 5-10mph and appeared to hover at altitude twice as it moved south.  I pointed it out to several friends and they all witnessed it too.  The object as best as I can describe was round, glowing and flickering almost fire like and as far as we could tell silent.  At its closest point to us there was a second smaller object very dim following slightly behind it and off to one side.  It was hard to judge ! the distance of the second object to the first although it did cross it's path more than once.  This area of downtown Seattle is in the flight path for the airport so there are planes in the sky constantly.  Along the flight path of the object a plane did cross a couple of miles behind and above it.  My point is that we're all familiar with the lights on the aircraft flying around the sky most evenings and this had a much warmer non blinking glow and was traveling much to slowly for a commercial airliner or private plane.  After about 5 minutes it had traveled pretty far south and we lost sight of it.  The second sighting was about 20 minutes later waiting in traffic on Dexter Ave.  The object appeared east of the previous location on the other side of the lake.  This time it shot up from behind a large hill at about a 45 degree angle then leveled off at what appeared to be the same altitude as before and headed slowly north until it was out of our sight.  This sighting lasted abou! t 2 minutes no second object was seen.  Somebody asked me if I ! thought it was a lantern.  I don't think so, as it appeared to be under powered flight and moving in a controlled manner. It also appeared far too large for a lantern. There was no significant breeze at the time and without power not sure how it would have later showed up moving in the opposite direction. There is a video posted on Youtube this morning along with comments from other witnesses in the area. The video is NOT mine an is not very well shot, it also does not get across the warmth and orange hue of the object as we saw it.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0JM1SFszE   I'm not suggesting this was E.T. :) but it was most certainly an unidentified flying object.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

At first I noticed it and pointed it out to my friend and thought that it must be Mars.   5 minutes later I looked again and noticed that the one object had been joined by 5 other spheres of a similar orange glowing nature.   The objects just hung in the sky without making any noise.  Then the objects began to take off one by one and disappearing into the sky.  The last one stayed behind for an extra 10 minutes and then left.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Orange sphere seen by 7-10 people in Seattle over Elliott Bay;2013-04-04 00:30:00;2 minutes;orange sphere seen by 7-10 people in Seattle over Elliott Bay UFO Sighting in Seattle 04.04.13 at 00:30am I was leaving my office in Belltown (downtown Seattle) when a group of club patrons and the bouncer next door pointed up into the night sky over Elliott Bay and said, Hey, look at that!  I looked west from my office over the bay and saw an orange globe or sphere that was slightly fuzzy around the outer edges and had a gold center, moving from the west toward us.  It was moving slower than the 737's that come in over the bay to head south to SeaTac airport.  was clearly not an airliner.  It came in from the west then turned south along the waterfront then began oscillating along its path southward then turned west and accelerated heading west over West Seattle and then disappeared.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Black sphere over Seattle;2013-07-01 20:00:00;~5 minutes;Black sphere over Seattle Black sphere similar to the one(s) filmed in Southern California and Ecuador around the same time and posted to YouTube. From atop our building's roof deck we observed this sphere move south above Puget Sound at a relatively low speed and at various heights.  At the time of evening aviation lights would have been easily seen, but we saw none from this object. It did not flash, glow, or display any light or give off any sound.  We are very familiar with aircraft as Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is located nearby, Boeing is local, and sea planes and other small craft are a fixture in our skies as they come and go from our many bodies of water.  We observed commercial and light aircraft with appropriate aviation lighting at the same time as the event, all clearly identifiable.  When we attempted to photograph the sphere, our cameras would not focus on the object, thus a black blur is all that is observable.

Orange spheres/orbs over Seattle.;2013-12-24 20:40:00;4 minutes;Orange spheres/orbs over Seattle At approximately 8:40 PM on 12/24/13 returning to Bellevue from dinner my wife and I, with two children in the car, observed four very bright orange lights in a diamond shape over Seattle near the Space Needle.  We instantly we shocked as they were not commercial aircraft and flew in a coordinated manner and shifted to a rectangle, and then an oval.  If I had to guess they were 500 meters in diameter.  It seemed like there was a shape or form within the lights but it was impossible to tell for sure.  They traveled south of the city and at about where Boeing Field is they ascended vertically through the low cloud layer and vanished.  During the ascent we saw a commercial airliner fly under the lights.  We observed them for about 3 minutes, and during this our neighbors, also returning from a dinner, pulled up and saw the same (their oldest child was terrified, as was mine). During this a 5th orange light appeared from the same area and followed an identical flight pattern and vanished.  Attached is video I took for about 30 seconds when my wife told me to grab my phone.  I was excited and should have spent more time taping.  During the episode the entire sky appeared to briefly flash white, which is on video.  About 10 minutes afterwards I was still watching the sky and believe I saw a fighter jet fly over the city.  A work colleague I told the story to says they heard a fighter jet fly over their Bellevue home.  My neighbor who also witnessed the event says he was traveling north from the Federal Way area and had seen a number of military helicopters flying in the area.  What we saw were not helicopters.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Round metallic object observed over South Seattle.;2014-06-07 11:50:00;3-4 minutes;Round metallic object observed over South Seattle At 11:50 am on June 7th, 2014, while laying on a lounge chair on my back deck, I noticed a round metallic object in the sky to the east of me.   It looked to be just below some white clouds and was moving slowly to the South.  The object appeared to be over the south end of Boeing field off the I-5.   I observed it for approximately 3-4 minutes, as it moved to the South over South Center shopping area, at which time it disappeared into the clouds.   At one point, while I was observing the object, a commercial plane flew by from the North and looked to be fairly close to the object.   I did capture this sighting on my IPhone at full zoom (466Megabits).  The object was round in shape, metallic looking and appeared to reflect the sun.   I will also say that, to me, it appeared to move in a deliberate fashion from the North to the South. Conditions:  Daytime, about noon Mostly sunny day A few big white clouds Unobstructed views to the East, South and West   I would be happy to share the video and speak with anyone who is interested, as long as my name remains anonymous. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and he sounded to us to be both eloquent, and serious-minded, in his description of the sighting.

3 red orbs over Lake Union before Fireworks.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;3 red orbs over Lake Union before Fireworks On the 4th of July, I walked to Lakeview Blvd E on Capitol Hill to watch the fireworks that would be going on at Gas Works Park that night.  I got there a little before 10pm. There were several planes flying around and most of them had red and white lights.  I saw 3 small red orbs slowing moving from the west to the east.  They were flying over the Fremont bridge and Aurora bridge.  They were flying in a triangular formation.   They rounded Queen Anne Hill and started flying south.  It was partly cloudy that night.  They flew under a dark cloud.  Then the first one disappeared into the cloud and then the second and then the third. It was before the fireworks started and I hadn’t been drinking or using drugs.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Three orange orbs in triangle shape hover then move across sky in a line.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;1 minute;Three orange orbs in triangle shape hover then move across sky in a line. It was around 10 pm on July 4, 2014, and I was out in the front yard of a friend on Queen Anne Hill in Seattle, waiting for the fireworks over Lake Union when seemingly out of nowhere three orange orbs appeared in the eastern sky looked like they could have been over South Lake Union or Beacon Hill.  They weren’t very big but clearly visible.   They hovered in a triangular shape for about 10-15 seconds -- one object above and two below that.  I told my friend, those are UFOs!  But he laughed and said, No they’re not.   And I said, then what are they?  He had no answer.  The triangle moved slowly and in unison to the right (S) and moved behind a tree, so we ran over to the edge of the yard to see if we could track them.  I could see the orange lights through the branches.  (These objects were high in the sky I don’t mean they were behind this tree across the street.)   When they emerged, the orbs spread out into a line and the one farthest to the right turned and dropped a bit below the others.  Again, they just hovered for about 10 seconds.  I was slapping my friend on the back and saying, see, see, those are UFOs!  Then the one to the far right disappeared.  It was just gone.  The other two hung on for a few more seconds and then they, too, were gone, first one, then the other. Yes, there were many choppers and airplanes in the air waiting for the fireworks, but they were noisy and I could easily identify them as aircraft.  At the time we saw the orbs, all the aircraft were farther north and were clearly not near the objects. I flew airplanes as a student pilot years ago, and have many hours of flying time, including solo landings.  I know what aircraft are like and these were not conventional aircraft. The fireworks had not started so these were not fireworks.  Unless there’s a new kind that can hover, turn, stop, and change formations in a crisp manner. I was thinking maybe they were flares, but they just didn’t look like flares.  The orbs were not wavering, fuzzy, but very stable and clear in the sky. To the west, there was a quarter moon out, but again, it couldn’t be confused with these very orange, very round, very clear objects that were hovering in front of us. I looked online the next day and somebody posted a video that shows an orange globe hovering and moving in the sky.  A commenter said it was a Chinese lantern, which, he said, were everywhere last night.  What we saw was not a lantern. When I got home last night, I called my son and told him about it and he said, wow, that’s weird because I saw an orange object hanging over Beacon Hill about the same time.  He said he thought at first that it was a planet but it seemed too big for a planet and it was very round and orange. So, that whole experience was a first for me and my disbelieving friend who witnessed it with me.  I have no idea what they were but sure wish I could find out.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Round metallic object moving slowly over Boeing field;2014-07-29 16:30:00;4-6 minutes;Round metallic object moving slowly over Boeing field On Tuesday July 29th at 4:30pm as I was driving N/B on Martin Luther King Way a reflection of light in the sky caught my attention.  This was a beautiful sunny day with no clouds in the sky.  I observed sunlight reflecting off of a round-smooth metallic (chrome) ball in the sky.  It appeared to be hovering about 500 feet over Boeing field.   As the object began moving very slowly to the N/W I could see it clearly.  There were no markings on it and appeared to be perfectly smooth and chrome in color.  It’s hard to judge the size because of nothing near it to compare to, but I’m guessing it was about the size of a house. As I watched the object move slowly to the N/W it seemed to “fade out” or blend into the sky (I could still see the shape of it).  I continued watching it until it went completely out of view.  I kept looking in the area to hopefully see it again.  The round metallic object reappeared and began to slowly ascend straight up-then it just disappeared!;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

That was while the helicopter was  flying around with the American flag. Then at 10:20 pm, the fireworks started and the red light turned to green and headed East.  I didn’t see it again.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

The white glowing orb glided less than the height distance of what an airplane would.   I was caught by surprise due to the silence, I didn’t hear the sound of a plane, the object didn’t make a sound.   As I watched the orb travel by, it appeared to make a slight zigzag motion on two occasions, it didn’t seem to elevate in height and was on a trajectory.

I was looking at the Seattle city-scape from the 4th floor of the VA hospital.  I thought I would take a picture of the buildings with my phone.  When I held up the phone to snap some pics I instantly realized that something was flying around above the city.  I could see it on the screen of my phone but the object was completely invisible to my eye.  So I snapped a couple pics and then realized i needed to start recording video.  Which I did. Got about 90 seconds worth of video.  I later noticed a second object flying above and to the right of the more visible one.

It looked almost translucent at times, and was tensile, reminding me of a large cell wall.  When I first noticed it, it was roughly 60-80 feet above me.  There were no clouds in the sky, which is rare for Seattle, and I was able to follow it up until my eyes couldn’t focus on it any longer.
