Cylinder UFO Sighted in Seattle, Washington;1980-07-16 13:40:00;3 minutes;Cylinder UFO Sighted in Seattle, Washington I was taking my dogs in my yard, noticing that there were a few planes in the sky, when far off and up in the sky I saw a long white completely straight object that looked like it was a white stick floating in the sky. At first I thought it was exhaust from a plan, but as I looked closer, I saw that it was completely straight and appeared like it could be a floating cylinder in the sky, maybe about the length of 3 or 4 planes - hard to judge distance and actual size. I stared at it for about 2 or 3 minutes, when I realized I should run inside to grab my phone to take a picture, I usually have my phone on me at all times! 20 seconds later when I came back it was gone. I think it left cause it knew I was gonna take a picture! My first ufo sighting! I'm excited.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
2-12-03 orange fiery/glowing circular object flying above tree level  watched for about 10 seconds in Shoreline Washington;2003-02-12 18:00:00;10-15 seconds;2-12-03 orange fiery/glowing circular object flying above tree level  watched for about 10 seconds in Shoreline Washington It was around 6pm on Wednesday when my 14 year old daughter asked me what that burning orange light was. I went over to the sliding glass door and looked up. My 11 year old son came with us.What I saw was a moving glowing orange, or could have been burning round object moving at a steady rate of speed and altitude at above tree level. I wear glasses and thought I just could not make out what I was seeing. I ran back into my apartment and grabbed my glasses, my son grabbed his binoculars. Wearing my glases did not help me recognize what I was looking at. Actually it only filled me with more disbelief and questions. My son looked through his binoculars and said that it looked like a spinning top with an antenna on the top of it. I know that sounds so cliche but I honestly have never seen any thing like this before. I did not have time to look through them because it was already out of my line of sight . This object made no sound had no tail. It stayed on what looked like a path to me.If my kids had not seen it as well I would have thought I had lost my mind. I did call 911 jut because of the way things are going with terrorist threats and that. They refered me to th FAA she treated me like I was a nut and sent me to the ufo center.That is what we saw and now I am on more of an alert when I look up into the sky. I guess what I want most is to hear a logical explanation as to what we saw.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Shiny cylndrical object hovering over downtown Seattle;2003-08-30 13:30:00;30 minutes;Shiny cylndrical object hovering over downtown Seattle My wife and I were walking in downtown Seattle on Sunday, 08/30/03. The weather was clear and sunny. We had walked to Pike Place Market and exited out to Post Alley to go and look at some of the furniture stores. As I waited outside while my wife looked in a shop, I looked up and noticed a shiny, cylindrical object hovering over the city. It appeared to be motionless, but occasionally it would appear to rotate slightly because the quality of the sun's reflection would change on its surface. I assumed that it was a helicopter, but I couldn't see any rotor blades. My wife came out of the store and I pointed the object out to her and we watched it for around 10 minutes. It didn't move during that time. We continued walking, and we went in a few stores over the next 20 minutes and each time we came back out onto the street the object was still in the same location, still rotating slightly causing the sunlight to glint off it. At one point, we stopped to watch an aircraft fly past it and as we did, we noticed a very tiny speck of white light (which I assumed to be a satellite or perhaps the ISS going past) travel past the object and stop. We continued to walk, and when I looked up again, the dot was gone but the cylyndrical object remained. After we had observed the object for approximately a half hour, it started to slowly drift to the southeast and we lost sight of it over the tall buildings in downtown Seattle.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
long, narrow cylindrical object hanging horizontally above Seattle for about 2 minutes, then disappearing completely in 4 seconds.;2004-03-08 13:00:00;2 minutes;long, narrow cylindrical object hanging horizontally above Seattle for about 2 minutes, then disappearing completely in 4 seconds. Driving south on I-5 from Edmonds right around 175th St. I noticed a jet flying across the sky from west to east. Then I noticed what looked like the trail from another jet, except it kind of looked like two trails from a jet real close together. As I watched it more, there was no jet, and the trail wasn't getting any longer. It was completely horizontal (north to south). It was fairly high in the sky, and as I looked at it more over a period of about a minute, I swear it looked like a perfect row of small windows going down the length of it. It also seemed to have a perfect, long, cylindrical shape, with the windows going down the middle. I could tell it was cylindrical because the top and bottom kind of faded as if there was some roundness to the object. I couldn't tell how high it was in the sky, but the object looked enormous. After about two minutes of watching it, it performed a 4 second fade out from being completely visible, to disappearing completely. I've never witnessed the trail of a jet disappear that quick after being visible for that long. There is not one cloud in the sky today, completely empty blue sky except for first jet that I saw, and the other unexplainable object. There's no way I was the only person to have seen it, there was tons of cars on the freeway, and the object was in plain view as you were driving southbound. From where I was, it looked like it was hovering directly over the Northgate area, but pretty high up. First time I've seen anything like that in person.

Three Bronze cylinders;2004-04-30 16:45:00;30 seconds;Three Bronze cylinders I am a Transit driver and was heading south out of the tunnel passing Royal Brougham. Approaching Holgate street I spotted 3 brown cylinder shapes hovering over 4th avenue 800-900 feet in the air.  They were bronze and I could see the sun reflecting off the metal.   I took off my sun glasses for a better look and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I exclaimed to my passengers, Can you see that?  No one heard me.  There was one large one and two smaller ones trailing beside it and behind. The large one was rounded in front much like an overturned canoe would look. There were deep lines carved in it forming a design. It appeared to be made of a rich bronze like metal highlighted by the sun. I looked well ahead to see if they were being towed by an aircraft.  There was nothing, they just hovered and appeared to be moving very slowly like a blimp. I kept driving and then came up on the side of a building which blocked my view. As I cleared the building and got a clear shot of where they had been, they had disappeared.  It was really strange. The following day I drove back to the area I had seen them in. There wasn't anything there which would account for what I saw. The area they had been in were between Holgate and Lander street moving very slowly, west, over 4th avenue.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
A bending black rod hovering over First Hill!;2004-10-24 17:00:00;5 minutes;A bending black rod hovering over First Hill! I witnessed the object while standing in a gas station parking lot on First Hill in Seattle.  It was a long black rod at about a 45 degree angle from my vantage point.  The object made no sound.  At first I thought it was a balloon.  As I watched though, I noticed it wasn't drifting or changing direction.  The object hovered in the same spot, just under cloud height.  It appeared to be about half the width of an average sized airplane at that height, but the same length. I called one of the gas station employees over to see if she could see it too.  She saw the object, and we watched it for about two minutes, when we were joined by a woman who wanted to know what we were looking at.  As we watched, the object appeared to bend ever so slightly.  It bent back and forth like this maybe three or four times, taking about 15 seconds for each flex.  The gas station employee left to help some customers.  The other woman and I watched the object for another 3 minutes or so, and as we watched, it moved upward into the clouds above it, until neither of us could see it anymore.  I stood and watched for another 5 minutes in case it came out of the cloud, but it did not. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two seemingly credible reports from same source.

Cylindrical object hovering past my car at close range;2005-10-15 22:00:00;1.5 min;Cylindrical object hovering past my car at close range Location: Heading southbound on Highway 599, on the ramp just before it merges with I-5.  I am a male, and was 37 years of age at the time of this sighting. I work in the printing industry and have a background in fine art. I feel these two facts enhance my testimony and illustration provided.  I noticed two stationary extremely bright white lights, side-by-side horizontally in a fixed position at about 400 feet above the ground, in the sky directly in front of me. At first it appeared to be an aircraft coming in for a landing, the bright lights being standard landing lights.  After several seconds I noticed two odd things about these lights. Firstly, they were a bit too far apart for an ordinary plane configuration and secondly, they were barely moving  closer to me despite my driving towards them. This clearly indicated to me that the object was in fact stationary and not moving forward as an airplane would do.  I slowed my car down considerably since nobody was driving behind me, and started carefully observing the craft.  The two lights remained in their fixed positions for a moment and then began banking slowly and steadily to the left, all the while not getting any closer to me. After tilting to about 45 degrees the lights began approaching me smoothly and steadily.  As the lights came nearer, the object started to pass me to my left at  an altitude of roughly 40 feet, and travelling approximately 20-30 miles per hour. It looked to be about 30 feet in length, and 10 feet in width. It remained tilted at a 45 degree angle the remaining duration of the sighting. The two extremely bright lights had now dimmed, or perhaps were no longer pointed directly at me and only seemed dimmer because of this.  As it drifted past to my left, I got a very good look at it since I had slowed my car down considerably to about 25 miles per hour. At the closest point it was only about 50 feet from my car. The object was sillouetting the lights of the valley and the distant hills and dark gray sky behind it, revealing a distinct long cylindrical shape. There were roughly six white lights on the visible side of the object, with no particular order to their distribution and they were all rather small. The lights were in two slightly differing sizes, with the upper and lowest lights being the larger. There weren't any strobes on this object, or any small colored marker lights which to my knowledge is not the case with conventional aircraft. There were no rotors, wings, cockpit or audible sound. A helicopter would definately have some audible noise at such a close distance, and the rotors would have been visible. There was one large red light on the side and just about dead center, which blinked with a slow on-and-off pattern at one second length intervals. This red light appeared at least a foot in diameter and didn't flash, but steadily faded off and on. This red light was a perfect circle which appeared raised like a dome similar to a lighting fixture one might have on the ceiling of their home. There was a very narrow and bright beam of light emanating from the center of the object and aimed directly in front of it. The beam of light was aimed just slightly lower than horizontally. The searchlight was steady and appeared fixed to the object because it never changed position in any way.  The object continued off toward my left rear and floated over the ground at the same altitude, it's searchlight still shining out and onto the ground below and continued at a south-easterly direction.  Since this time I have observed multiple helicopters at night in order to make a comparison and there are no similarities between any helicopters and this UFO.

Cylindrical object with 3-4 rows of bright lights & vapor between ground & object  hovering silently at 500-1000' above ground.;2006-02-10 17:30:00;2 minutes;Cylindrical object with 3-4 rows of bright lights & vapor between ground & object  hovering silently at 500-1000' above ground. An object that appeared to be around 40-50' in diameter appeared to be hovering silently at an approximate altitude of 500-1000' above the ground.  The object had 3-4 rows of extremely bright lights (with clear lenses) around its perimeter.  These lights made it difficult for the observer to determine the shape and size of the upper portion of the object.  However, the underside was circular and the sides with the lights were cylindrical in shape.  From the bottom of the object was a somewhat thick, white trail, like a water vapor, with no sign of gray exhaust (or any type of carbon-based fuel).  This object hovered at this low altitude for about a minute.  When the witness (my wife) and I returned to where she saw the object (1-2 minutes after sighting), it was gone.  This sighting was in NE Seattle, at the corner of 14th Ave. E and NE 120th (above the Pinehurst Park).  The next day, I spoke to another person who had witnessed (what she described to be) a similar object in the sky to the west of Magnuson Park in Seattle (towards where my wife saw it). 10-15 minutes later, another witness saw (what appeared to be) a military/security helicopter rushing towards the direction of this sighting, despite the fact that we did not report it.  Perhaps someone called 911...;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Too steep for a plan;2010-01-09 19:00:00;1 minute;Reviewing my photos I came across a suspicious object in the upper right corner and it way flying at an odd angle.  Too steep for a plane, since my father works for Boeing he told me it was too steep to be a plane.  My other photos with planes a night had more lights on them this one only had three.  Also a tiny bit to the left of the UFO there is 2 floating blue dots which I assume could be another UFO. Here is the photo like for you thanks for your time I hope this helps. http://i808.photobucket.com/albums/zz6/mackenzie_Wisdom/IMG_8551.jpg ((NUFORC Note:  Photo is of an aircraft, flying south toward Boeing Field or Sea-Tac International Airport, displaying strobe lights.
