After an instant, he realizes that it is not just a single point of light, but rather three pinpoints of light, oriented in a triangular orientation.  The objects were lurching relative to one another.  They went directly over his head, so he felt that he had a very good look at them.  Another person was also able to view the object(s) briefly.

They traveled for about 3 seconds and then they both dimmed away. Upon looking into the sky in a S-SW direction I first noticed 2 objects that looked like stars or satellites moving together at the same speed.  They were high up in the sky at about the 10-11 o' clock position.  They were moving about the same speed a satellite would appear to be moving.  They were bright white and moved in a downward westerly direction and then somewhat rapidly dimmed out completely.  Then I noticed a brighter star about a full moons distance away from the last position of the other two.  This was was much brighter and slowly moved in a downward westerly direction and it also slowly dimmed out and dissappeared.  I made a few calls to 911 and the FAA and no one had hear anything about this sighting.  I then called the King 5 TV news tip line and talked to a lady who said that they were just starting to recieve calls about some weird lights in the sky. She contacted me later in the evening -9:30pm- and told me that qiute a few people called in to report this.  They were unable to come to any conclusions as to what this may have been.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Align right edge of right hand to East. Object appeared at a point overhead of the left edge of the two hands. Center the two hands on the new, ENE-ish point, and with the wrists at eye level, the meteor/space debris/ appeared to fall in a path that would trace a line roughly across the fingertips, from center of the two hands to the left, and down the left side of the left hand to a level near the (5th distal metacarpal). There it burned out. No trails, flashing, voluntary movement, colors, or showering particles. The sky was dark and very clear in that direction. The actual time of event is approximate. All other details are correct. I am offering this as a sober accounting of facts just in case of such a need.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Brightness was about twice that of jupiter.  The sky was clear.  I thought it was a meteor, but there was no trail and it moved about half the speed of the hundreds of meteors I have seen, but much too fast to be an airplane and made NO SOUND. The object emmited two bright flashes from the bottom portion and continued roughly 3/4 of the way across the lake on a very slight downward path, where it blinked out at about 1300 ft AGL.  Total time observed was about 4 seconds. Unfortunately, my girlfriend was looking the other way.

It was not falling from the sky, but treversing very fast accross the sky. The object was unviewable after about 15 seconds. The object never chaned direction, and had a very destinct tail light of an bright orange color. The size of the object was about 4 to 5 times the size of a star. I have lived in seattle for over 9 years. I personally have not seen any green objects such as this until this past year. This is the third time I have seen the green light.

A few days later, the U.S. sends a rescue team to Antarctica to rescue a cancer victim at the South Pole, the middle of there winter.  I think Nancy Reagan  a asrologer had Ronald build Star Wars.

It lasted for about 5 seconds, then dropped immediately to about the size of a pea for about 3-5 seconds.  It then dropped to the brightness of a second magnitude star and started moving left to right at the speed of a satellite for about 3-5 seconds, then disappeared. Two of us were sitting in the yard about 10:35 p.m. watching a fireworks display that was being launched by a private party on Lake Washington near Medina.   All of a sudden a large light appeared to have been switched on high the sky in the ENE direction.  It was so bright that it caught our attention out of the corner of our eye. It was yellowish to white, and appeared to be just about the size of a dime.  After watching it stationary in the sky for about 5 seconds, the light immediately diminished to about the size of a pea and appeared white.  There was no movement.  About 5 seconds later the light dropped to about the size of a bright star, still with no movement.  A second after this change in size, the light started moving right to left about the speed of a satellite.  Movement lasted for about another 5 seconds, and then immediately disappeared. The sky was beautiful.  No clouds at all. The object or light was about 65-70 degrees from the horizon.  About the same level as the N. star.  Because of size the initial light appeared relatively close.  After it had dropped to the size of a bright star, it appeared to be at least satellite altitude.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Bright green object flying fast northbound, north of University of Washington in Seattle;2000-04-28 22:07:00;1.5 seconds;Bright green object flying fast northbound, north of University of Washington in Seattle I was driving northbound on Interstate-5, just south of the Ravenna exit, in the most left-hand lane at about 65 mph when I saw a single fast green light in the sky moving apparently from south to north.  It was to my right (east) and I saw it through my windshield for about 1.5 seconds.  (I have a compact '92 Mazda pick-up).   My first impression was a very fast aircraft, which I rejected because the nav light should have been red and, given the brightness of the light, an aircraft with such a nav light would have been flying too low for such a fast speed.  I looked at the vehicles over in the northbound express lanes to my immediate left but there were none which could have been going so fast as to cause such a reflection on the interior of my windshield, nor did I see any obvious green lights on the vehicles.   To me, the object was decidedly green.  I also had the impression of a flat trajectory, and it left no trail.  I also had the impression that it was wider than just a point of light.  This incident was tucked away in my mind until I heard a portion of Mr. Davenport's interview last Monday night on the radio and he mentioned this incident.  Unfortunately I didn't hear much of the interview, however, since I tuned in at the last sentence.  Incidentally, I was returning from a lecture and had not consumed any alcohol that Friday night (and I take no other mind-altering substances!).;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

At first I took it for a satellite, but then I saw a second light behind it htat seemed to be chasing the first light. They went straight across the sky for about 5 seconds in a north-northwesterly direction then the first light started to turn and start and stop like it was evading the second light.  The second light chased it like there was a dogfight or something.  The first light did at least three full 360's before taking off at a very high speed to the northwest.

Driving my Buick down the steep driveway to the security garage of my apartment building, I applied the brake to grab and operate the garage door-opener in my purse.  I happened to glance upward:  at the top center of the windshield, just above the steering wheel, in the western sky, fell a star-like object, in a zig-zag, almost floating fashion, slightly  toward the north.  It was slightly dimmer than what Venus has been recently  at first I thought it was a meteor - but it seemed more lightweight, as an ash or cinder would have fallen.  It was silvery-whitish-blue in color, and didn't change in color, a bit sparkly, but more like a planet than a star.  If it were to break into the atmosphere and land, it would have fallen a few miles beyond west Seattle, into Puget Sound - not as far in distance  as the Pacific Ocean.  If this thing had behaved like a normal meteor, I would never have phoned the UFO Center...I even looked up information, hoping a meteor shower was in progress...but I understand the Taurid meteor showers are not expected until close to 11/09/00.  If an investigator were to call, all I could do in addition to this report would be to trace the object's pattern from the top of the windshield to its descending northern position as it went beyond the shrubery at the top of the driveway.

Creamy yellow, slow moving light moving N to S, high in the sky, slow turnon/turnoff, then vanished.;2001-08-12 02:30:00;3 seconds;Creamy yellow, slow moving light moving N to S, high in the sky, slow turnon/turnoff, then vanished. While observing the meteor shower from my NNW facing window, I noticed a creamy yellow light appear out of nowhere high in the sky, a few degrees WNW from the second brightest star I can see from my vantage point (possibly in the constellation Casseopia, the thing that looks like a big W in the sky, which is almost directly overhead and to the NNW from my view at this time of day). The light was tiny and it looked & moved like a satellite in polar orbit, but the time of sighting would seem to preclude that possibility, as the sun has been down for some six hours. It came on slowly while moving directly south, increased in brilliance over about 1 second, stayed lit at around magnitude -2 to -3 for about another second, then dimmed & vanished over the next second, never to reappear.  I tracked its projected course until my view was obstructed by the exterior wall of my own building, and did not see it light up again.  The color did not change, and no trails or tails were left behind. Once it dimmed out, it could no longer be followed. The apparent size was smaller than the head of a common pin held at arm's length. The two meteors I observed earlier this morning before sighting this object both travelled very quickly (est. many tens of thousands of MPH), on a generally southeast-to-northwest track, and were colored white and blue-white respectively. One left a blue luminescent trail for a brief time.  This object was nothing like them.  The speed was all wrong, the direction of travel was wrong, and the color of the light wasn't a typical meteor color compared to any meteor I've ever seen. Any ideas? ((NUFORC Note:  At 0230 hrs. local time, no man-made satellites would be visible overhead.  They would be in the Earth's shadow, and therefore not illuminated.  If a satellite is not reflecting sunlight, it almost certainly is not visible to a person below without special optical equipment.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
colored lights stationary in sky on night of air traffic shutdown in USA 9/11/01;2001-09-11 21:00:00;3 hours;colored lights stationary in sky on night of air traffic shutdown in USA 9/11/01 Id be surprised if this turned out to be a possible extraterrestial issue, but it WAS an Unidentified Flying Object (at least to my brother and I).  From about 2100 hours we watched a tight group (seemingly on a single object) of three colored lights remain roughly stationary for about 3 hours (when we stopped checking) in the sky (about 10 oclock high) to the North-East (visible from SE Seattle, from ridge above south end of Lk. Washington). The colors were a distinct green, red and white.  They moved just slightly, relative to each other, indicating some small movement, but over the period of viewing, the object stayed basically stationary in what was seemingly a hover pattern from our distance (up close, maybe a tight circle?).  We were interested in particular due to the total grounding of all civilian aircraft that night.  The size of the lights and intensity was about right for a planet, but the lack of move over time ended that thought for us (as well as the sharply varying colors). I would be very interested to find out what this was...I ended up guessing a military object of some kind doing some sort of surveillance in light of the NY City attack...but, the stationary nature of the object and duration of presence confounded me.  Can anyone help with ideas here?;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Non-mobile red white and blue steadily flashing light at 40 degrees in the west sky;2001-09-15 21:30:00;over an hour;Non-mobile red white and blue steadily flashing light at 40 degrees in the west sky We saw a light twinkling steadily red, white and blue (this is NOT a hoax) at about 40 degrees west over Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains.  It looked like a very bright star, even through binoculars, except for the steady red white and blue light flashing from it.  It was as bright as Mars was when it was at it's closest to Earth.  Fort Lewis is only 30 miles or so away, and Boeing field is about 10 miles South, but there were no commercial flights and besides, it did not move.  We left after about an hour, so I do not know what happened to it.  Among the witnesses: a chemist, a biologist, a teacher, a bar owner,  an airline employee, a web designer. ((NUFORC Note:  Our first suspicion would be that the witnesses were observing a celestial body of some type, but they sound like qualified witnesses, which might militate against our theory.  We would like to know azimuth and elevation of the object, in order to rule out Mars, which would be in that part of the sky at the time indicated.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Bright red light in the Seattle sky.;2001-09-18 22:30:00;30 seconds;Bright red light in the Seattle sky. I was walking down Harvard Ave. near Seattle Central Community College heading south from Thomas St. and in the sky was a bright red light. It was brighter than any plane, rather like a flare, but steady and without a flare's smoke. I did not hear any plane or engine noise. The light's course was paralell but to the east. It continued at the same speed for a few seconds & went behind a tree, but I could still see it. When it was behind this tree, there seemed to let go of a another red light that moved down to the ground (or at least to the northeast, out of view). Within a few more seconds the light had moved behind a buliding & I was not able to see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.

It descended in a slight arc trajectory at approximately 50 degrees.  It noticeably increased in brilliance from pale green to neon green as it descended.

I am a 23 year old ((profession deleted)) who lives in the Greenlake area of Seattle, WA. I have lived in Seattle for close to five years. I was looking at the eastern horizon/sky for a moment at around ten minutes to 10:00 PM on Monday evening (April 29), when I saw a bright green light zip down across the sky towards the horizon (at a twenty degree angle) from above and North. The light was vey bright (although far away) and didn't leave any sort of trail even though it was traveling amazingly fast. So fast that it was gone in a second or two. I described it's size first as 1/15th the size of the moon, but after more thought I think a more accurate description would be four times the size of the North Star. It was a very curious sight that I am glad I was able to witness. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded quite credible.  Please see other report from Seattle for this event.

At first it appeared to be approaching airliner landing at Seatac airport. I looked away for 2-4 seconds while moving to get a better view, and the object was gone. Had it been an aircraft it would have continued to be visible. As I looked in the direction of the tree I heard the rasping sound of an animal such as a bird.

craft seen over seattle with no running lights and no sound.;2002-08-09 22:18:00;1 minute;craft seen over seattle with no running lights and no sound. The craft appeared to be a plane at a relatively high altitude. However, as the craft came closer to allow for an inspection of the common blinking lights that planes or helicopters have, I discovered that it had none. The two lights that were visible were also in the wrong position for a plane type craft as they were one in front of the other. As the craft moved out of sight, there was still no sight of red, green or any other color strobe light that would indicate it was a normal type of craft. As I live where i can see planes and helicopters fly over the city on a consistent basis, I would say that the elevation was similar to the height of a craft at 10,000 elevation. It moved fast across the sky and was out of sight quickly.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Rainier in clear view. I noticed a bright light against the mid-protion of the mopuntain (north face) that did not appear to move. I thought that it might be a plane coming in to Sea Tac with the sun reflecting off of it but when I look at it again it was still in the same place. A minute later, when my view was restored, the object moved to the west side of the mountain and, I think, at a lower altitude. After that, the object moved further west and then I lost view of it as it, from what I could perceive, moved to the south.

All of a sudden I saw a a really bright light in the southwest sky (about an aspirin at arms length), It lasted about 3 seconds and started to fade and then disappear. It brightened as it was heading in the northeast direction but then faded into the northwest sky, almost U-shaped. I told my husband to check it out but he only caught the fading, so he told me to make a wish, and I did, but I grew up in Montana so I've seen my fare share of shooting stars. About a minute passes, and I'm talking about how weird it looked and my husbands now looking up at the sky with me, and another one in the exact same spot going in the same direction. A small bright light that looks like it was shining down getting bigger and then it gets smaller and disappears. My husband suggested an airplane turning, we see aircraft all the time here, but it was too high up there and we didn't see a trail. It wasn't a meteor or shooting star. And it was weird that it appeared twice in the same spot, going in the same direction. Just can't explain it.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

We live in Burien, WA., a few miles from Sea-Tac airport and are used to seeing various aircraft in the sky. We also see King Co. police helecopter Gurdian One, frequently.

I was looking East and saw it about the time it either began glowing or came out from behind some trees. It went south and descended slightly, I could see it for 5 or 6 seconds. It seemed to be moving slowly, and it brightened as it went, (got venus-like in brightness, but a sharper point of light) so it might have been vectoring towards me as well.  It was 2 to 2 1/2 hands up off the horizon, and traversed 3 1/2 to 4 hands left to right. It seemed to be fading and slowing before it disappeared behind some other trees. Also, it clearly broke in two pieces about 3/4 of the way through the sighting. Seemed like a slightly smaller piece separated and took a slightly slower and lower path. Obviously I can't gauge the distance, but it seemed like it was near, maybe over Lake Washington. I hope you get other sightings to triangulate this.

It also slowed down at one point and then sped back up until no longer visible. This whole incident lasted about 3 seconds.  This was NOT a meteor (or falling star),it actually appeared to be ascending.   I also felt that it was much to fast to be a satellite, unless we now have a new generation of high speed satellites that I'm unaware of. Also, most satellites I see are moving in a general north-south or south to northerly direction, from my viewpoint and this was as I stated, east to west. Since it was over so fast, I actually shook my head and found myself saying. did I actually just see that??  It seemed odd but I guess it could've been a satelite?

Two objects with pulsating lights in Seattle over Puget Sound.;2005-01-02 03:40:00;45 minutes;Two objects with pulsating lights in Seattle over Puget Sound. I woke up at 3:40 AM and looked out my downtown apartment window to the Southwest. My apartment is on the 13th floor. Between the tall buildings, over the Puget Sound, I saw a stationary, pulsating light that changed color from blue-white to red, yellow, and green. I awoke my partner and she also saw the object. At one point a smaller white light seemed to emerge from the bottom of the craft, but it disappeared immediately. With binoculars we could make out the colors better, but could not discern a shape to the object. I took several pictures with both digital and film cameras. If the photos show anything I will submit them to this site. After watching the lights for about 20 minutes, I noticed a second craft to the west of the original one. It was identical in appearance, with pulsating blue-white, red, yellow, and green lights. The lights on the two objects did not appear to pulse in unison. The second craft also appeared to hover without motion over the Sound, perhaps a mile or so from the first. The first craft was lower in the sky than the second, not very high in the air. At 4:24 AM, the first craft slowly disappeared behind a building after arcing downward toward the west. The other craft remained stationary and I finally fell asleep.

white light similar to satellite traveling high over Seattle;2005-01-02 17:18:00;3-4 minutes;white light similar to satellite traveling high over Seattle At about 5:17 this evening I was on my deck and as always looking up at the sky to see what was there.  It was just getting dark and the stars were starting to show up, (the brightest ones first of course), were all I could see at this time.  So, right by the star Capella, I believe, in the constellation of Auriga, there was a rather bright light appearing to be the same size and brightness of that star (Capella) traveling in a East, Southest direction, at a fairly slow speed.  At first my thoughts were that it was a Satellite~ and it could have been I guess, however it didn't seem to act like any satellite I've seen before.  First of all, it was for sure not a plane! There were no blinking lights on this object,just a white light, like a star.  Usually satellites disappear quite quickly and sometimes even flash as if in rotation and reflecting light as they rotate, but this light stayed the same intensity the whole time I observed it.  I actually ran into the house and grabbed my binoculars and ran back out and still found it moving in the same general direction without the binocs!  So I followed it with the binoculars for a couple more minutes until it faded and finally disappeared, which was fairly close to the horizon /Cascade Mountains.  It also did seem to speed up and change direction of its course although this was not real apparent, not like rapid changing or sharp angled turns. Just a sort of veering into a more southerly direction and speeding up slightly.  It also didn't seem to be as high as a satellite usually travels.  That is about it, nothing overly exciting but I thought it was worth writing in about.  I'm wondering if anyone else saw it and might of reported it also.  I'd be interested to know if you think it was a satellite. Thanks, DC;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

White, small lights seen in the clear day sky.  Objects seem 5 times in various locations over 45 minutes.;2005-08-20 18:45:00;45 minutes;White, small lights seen in the clear day sky.  Objects seem 5 times in various locations over 45 minutes. Hi, we live in the Olympic Hills neighborhood in north Seattle.   At 6:45PM, while soaking in our backyard hottub, I saw an object in the bright, cloudless east sky that was a light/white dot in the sky, almost like a bright star, but it was pretty small.  I was sure it wasn't an airplane.  I thought it was more likely could be a mylar balloon that someone had let go.  It was pretty small and far away and my wife actually couldn't see it.   After watching it for a minute, my curiosity got to me and I jumped out of the tub and ran upstairs to get the binoculars.  On the upstairs back deck (also on the east side of the house), I observed the object through the binoculars but there still wasn't much detail to be seen...it looked like a bright white dot, only larger.  It was sort of like when you look at stars at night with binoculars... you can certainly see them better that with the naked eye, but they still are basically white dots.   The sun which was getting ready to start setting in the west was casting it's light eastward and was illuminating this object.  The object which I had initially seen straight east, had been moving to the north and eventually I couldn't see it anymore. I dismissed this object as a balloon.  I went back down to get back in the hot tub, leaving the binoculars upstairs.  Then 10 minutes later, I was surprised to see what looked like the same object, but it was a bit brighter and appeared due east of us, just between 2 tree tops.  I got out again, and went back upstairs to grab the video camera and binoculars.  I very quickly headed out to deck, but even though only 30 seconds had passed, the object which had been quite visible was gone again.  I turned the camera on and filmed in the same area where I had seen the object, but it wasn't visible.  I looked through the binoculars but couldn't see anything.  So this time I took the video camera and binoculars back down and set them on the table next to the hot tub.  About 10 minutes later, the object appeared again and this time both my wife and I saw the object through the binoculars and I took a video of the object which lasted about 30-40 seconds before the battery on the camera died.  With the camera running, I zoomed in on the object, and you can see the trees underneath it in the forground.  The video captures what we saw reasonably well.  With the battery in the camera dead, we passed the binoculars back and forth a few times for a few minutes, occasionally losing sight of the object.  My wife had the binoculars and said Oh, there's 2 objects now which was something I could also observe with the naked eye.  I took the binculars and what I saw was a bit odd.  There were definitely 2 distinct objects/lights in the sky that were close enough to each other that both appeared in the view of the binoculars.  But then I noticed that the one to the left actually consisted of 2 lights that seemed tethered together. There was a top light and immediately below it was another light that seemed to be swinging under the top light left to right and back again like a pendulum.  The two objects didn't stay visible for long and we lost sight of them again.  About 8-9 minutes later, a single light appeared again and I watched it for about 4 minutes through the binoculars.  It was far enough away so that I really had trouble finding it with the naked eye, but could find it eventually if I scanned around using the binoculars.  At this point it was just a single light and I didn't see the pendulum behavior anymore.  Again I lost sight of the object.  About 8 minutes later, again I saw another light that was directly east and about in the same position of the initial object that I had seen.  So over a period of about 40-45 minutes I guess we same this object about 5 different times in various locations in the sky.  They were not conventional aircraft, and certainly were not a single balloon.  I supposed it's possible it could be explained by multiple balloons/weather balloons.  It wasn't a mind-blowing event, but was still pretty unusual and getting it on video is kind of nice.  You may phone me if you wish to.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Bright blue lights in the night sky above downtown Seattle.;2005-09-03 22:30:00;5 minutes;Bright blue lights in the night sky above downtown Seattle. At a large party at a downtown Seattle loft, I and many people were on a rooftop veranda enjoying the mostly clear night sky.  I looked up and noticed what I thought was an airplane but as I stared at it, it was a brilliant blue light that was not blinking.  I stared at it for quite a while and noticed it would not blink, stay still for a bit, then move in one direction for a bit and then disappear.  Seconds later another bright blue-tinted light would appear in another section of the sky maybe the difference between 12 o'clock and 2 o'clock. I asked others to look up and see if they saw the same thing.  They all agreed they were not airplanes or satellites.  There were probably as many as three at one time but they kept popping up and disappearing.  Then after about 5 minutes of watching, we saw no more lights.

Bright orange lights seen moving slowly below solid overcast.;2005-12-12 20:35:00;5 minutes;While walking north on 18th Ave NE in Seattle's University District between 8:35 and 8:40 pm on December 12, 2005, I noticed a very bright orange light traveling slowly southward in the sky to the east of me.   I thought it was an airplane until I noticed that it was just a singular bright orange light with no other lights attached to it blinking or otherwise.  It was traveling under a vast grey cloud cover.   When I stopped and stood in the middle of a crosswalk to really observe it, it appeared to slow down even more until it ceased moving, then slowly began moving again.  It slowed to a standstill and started again 3 or 4 more times.   When I finally saw someone turn the corner on the next street in the direction I was going, I stopped them and asked if they could see the bright orange light in the sky.  It was much further away by then but was remaining stationary now and he said he could see it.  He asked me if I had a camera.  I said no.  We smiled and went on our ways.   I looked for it again a few seconds later and saw the orange light was still stationary but getting very dim as if disappearing into the grey clouds above it.  When I got to the middle of the next street I looked for it one last time but it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone shortly after the sighting.  The witness sounded to us to be an exceptionally good observer, and quite credible.  The object probably was not a conventional aircraft, given that it apparently had an orange light on its starboard side.  I am able to confirm that the sky was overcast at the time of the sighting.

2 Bright and VERY slow moving lights show up as brighter than any stars and disappear;2006-06-10 23:00:00;30 seconds;2 Bright and VERY slow moving lights show up as brighter than any stars and disappear 2 friends of mine and I were sitting in the hot tub.  The moon (almost full/full?) had just rose of the neighbors house.  The clouds were patchy.  I could see from the direction I was sitting (southernly) the Moon to my left and 2 planets (Venus,  Jupiter?) in the middle/right of my field of vision.  I looked up and noticed 2 slightly brighter lights in the sky about an inch apart between the planets.   I then made a mention that it was very strange those stars weren't there before, to which the 2 friends looked up, saw and verified them.  At this time, one of my friends noticed they were both moving (at same speed, maintaining the inch or so apart).  As they moved northernly, they became darker. And within 30 seconds, they were gone.   The speed at which the lights were going was much too slow to be a plane or satellite, and too bright for it to be a pair of helicopters and not be heard.   Curious to see if others saw the same thing!;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

There were no rays or beams of light from the ground shining up to them. They were random in movement but seemed circular in motion.   Peculiarly, as we were watching we walked under a street light and where it had been steady on it flickered.  Almost like the lights knew we were watching them.  It was very odd and I have never seen anything like it in my 45 plus years.  The lights were whitish grey against the clouds and large at approximately 200 ft above the ground.

Brilliant chartreuse green flashing beam, within a ring of bright red lights in Puget Sound.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2007-01-13 03:00:00;30-45 minutes;Brilliant chartreuse green flashing beam, within a ring of bright red lights in Puget Sound  morning of 1/13/07. Saturday morning 1/13/07 around 3:00am  looking due west from the beach in West Seattle toward Blake Island, I noticed something emitting bright red and green lights through some amount of cloud cover, that I assumed to be an approaching aircraft.    But the red/green lights didn't advance, so  I noted the position in the sky, lining it up between a white flashing marine beacon and other lights on Blake Island.  It seemed stationary.   With binoculars I could see that the body of the light was chartreuse green, surrounded by red lights.  It may have been round.  It seemed to emit green flashes of light, reminding me of a 4th of July firework, where separate streams of light shoot out geyser-like, all at once, arcing in different directions. The red lights didn't seem to flash like the center chartreuse green light.   The object seemed located much above and beyond Blake Island, at a position of about one o'clock from the center of the island.  I noticed another similar stationary red/green light at a position of about three o'clock in the sky, that wasn't irridescent or flashing.   I watched these lights for about 45 minutes before going to bed.  What with the unusually cold temperatures, I thought it might have been a phenomenon caused by ice in the air - although the stars visible that morning were unremarkable.  The next morning (Sunday 1/14/07) at 2:00am I checked to see if the two objects were still there, but they were not. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Two red balls of light heading East to West over Seattle on converging paths.;2007-01-23 20:55:00;3 to 4 seconds;Two red balls of light heading East to West over Seattle on converging paths. My wife and I live in the Central District of Seattle, Washington.  My wife is a lab tech at a pathology lab, and I work in library management.  On the evening of January 23, 2007 at approximately 8:55 p.m., we were standing on the back deck of the duplex we live in,  which is on the 2nd floor.  From there we have a fairly unobstructed view of the sky.  We also have a good view of airplanes coming in from the North and heading South for landing approaches at SeaTac airport.  We were talking and watching planes, when I leaned my head back to stretch my neck and saw two red balls of light flying parallel to each other heading from East to West.  They were at an altitude higher than the incoming planes, but lower than high flying jets.  There were both blood red in color with a slight diffusion of light around their centers.  No structure to either was visible.  They appeared identical, and the size of the lights was approximately twice that of the landing lights on low flying aircraft. As they traveled side by side from East to West  their paths were converging, but they did not meet. From my perspective, when they were approximately over downtown Seattle the two lights vanished.  My wife said that she saw them briefly begin to climb and then they were gone from view.  The sighting lasted a little over three seconds and we couldn’t hear any noise that seemed associated with the two lights. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be unusually objective and eloquent in his description of the event.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.

Strobe-type light moving quickly;2007-06-07 22:45:00;5 minutes;Strobe-type light moving quickly We live on the far south edge of Seattle just north of Renton, WA, just two blocks up from Lake Washington (so we have large windows and a view of the lake across from Mercer Island) and about five blocks north of the Boeing plant, which is on the south end of Lake Washington. So it may have been something from Boeing -- who knows. But after six months living here, this is unlike anything we’ve seen, and we see a lot of flying craft passing over the lake. Around 10:45 p.m. a flashing white light caught my eye.  It looked like a strobe light and was moving north to south quickly. I thought at first it was a police light but realized it was in the air, not on a street on Mercer Island as first thought.  My husband and I went out onto our back deck to get a better look, and the light suddenly reversed direction, moving from south to north.  My husband said, Oh my god, look how fast it's going!  Then the light moved as if it were coming toward us (west).  Then it moved southwest over our house and disappeared from our view. Whatever it was sounded like a plane, not a helicopter, but there were none of the blue or red flashing lights you usually see on plane wings it was just a white light that would come completely on, the go completely off, so you couldn't see it at all in the split-second that the light was off. Just after this light disappeared, two planes appeared to the north and the difference was marked -- their lights appeared more yellow and they appeared to be moving much slower than whatever else we saw. Anyway, it was different, so there it is. Thanks.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I watched the object travel a bit further when what I saw confirmed to me that this was not ordinary both the lights dimmed out slowly right in front of my eyes until I could not see them anymore, they were totally gone. I yelled at my friend to come look because he stopped looking because he was not interested, he missed the best part.

This was not a weather balloon, cloud, rocket, bird, or other explanable phenomenon.  It did not flicker, or appear to move, there was no apparent motion, trajectory, or drift.  It hovered for about 5 min.  Another observer independently verified what I saw.   A  similar  object with a distinct greenish tint  appeared from the right (east) and approached the original silver one, on an intersecting course, and then narrowly avoided it, and proceeded to turn around it in a clockwise arc.  I cannot estimate the size or distance, but comparison with passing aircraft indicated that this was VERY high.  After about 10 min it faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected.

Bright red orbish light hovering over Seattle bay area!;2008-04-26 11:55:00;5+ minutes;Bright red orbish light hovering over Seattle bay area! I went out on my deck to check the sky again once more before going to bed and my attention was drawn to the North as commercial flights were taking off to the North tonight and circling around Seattle, anyway, there was a bright red light moving in a northerly direction and ascending at a fairly slow speed.  I did a double take because I could not believe my eyes,  I thought at first a plane or helicopter but it was just a red light, no blinkers or different colors, just a steady glowing, red orb.  A commercial jet actually passed in front of it (from my view) and was banking left to head Westerly, this is when I knew it was NOT a plane or helicopter!  I knocked on the French door for my wife and frantically waved at her to come outside.  She came out and witnessed it for a minute and then went back in,   So, I ran and got my binocs and went to the front yard where I got an unobstructed view. By this time it was higher and I’m going to guess about 3-4 thousand feet?  Maybe less, I see plenty of Cessna’s flying at about the same altitude.  It then stopped and stayed in the relative same place for several minutes, it would sort of pulse I guess I would say or become less intense of a red every couple seconds.  It finally dimmed and then was gone.  I estimate that where it hovered for the longest would’ve been maybe a couple miles or so north of me, putting it directly over the West Seattle Freeway or the Seattle Port maybe?  It was very strange indeed specially due to the fact that I sent in a report last night for a triangle craft or 3 lights in formation that sped across the sky!

Strange Green Light sighted floating horizontally for 2 seconds over Phinney Ridge in Seattle, not matching normal flight patterns;2008-06-23 22:10:00;2 seconds;Strange Green Light sighted floating horizontally for 2 seconds over Phinney Ridge in Seattle, not matching normal flight patterns I was standing at the Phinney Neighborhood Center on Phinney Ridge in Seattle at about 10:08 to 10:10 pm talking to some friends. I was facing north looking out over the parking lot when I noticed a very bright greenish light appear suddenly over Phinney Ridge for about two seconds in my line of site above the parking lot, then floated for about 2 seconds to the northwest and then disappeared just above the light of sight beyond the tree at the north-west side of the parking lot. I immediately shouted out, “holy s**t did you guys just see that.” Except for one of the guys seeing something out of the corner of his eye, no one else did. This was not a huge surprise as I was the only one facing north. The sky was still quite light to the northwest and there were small scattered high clouds in the sky. From what I remember the light appeared to be well in front of the clouds, so I do not think it was a meteor. I have never seen a meteor at dusk. If it was a meteor, it was perhaps the brightest one that I have ever seen and it had a greenish tint to it. I would say it had a magnitude of brightness perhaps 5 times as bright as Mars when it is the closest to earth. I watch the Seattle skyline when I go out for walks in the evenings and am familiar with the flight patterns and the lights on the helicopters and airplanes flying above Seattle. I actually scan the skyline for any unusual moving lights or objects. The normal lights move at a snails pace compared to this light. This light just showed up out of nowhere, then disappeared. I have never seen a light moving like this above Seattle or any sky anywhere.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

She didn't say anything right away, but asked me to just look at it thinking it was just a star and her eyes may be playing tricks. I starred for a good 10 to 15 minutes also and when we started telling each other what we saw our stories started to match in a very weird way. So we both kept watching it for about another five minutes, both of us getting a very strange feeling and both getting goose bumps all over our bodies.

There were a few planes in the air, and this was clearly not one of them. It appeared to be a very bright star, literally falling from the sky. It reminded me of a flare coming out of its ascent.  It moved slower than a ‘shooting star’, was definitely brighter, and there was almost a blue-green tone to the light it gave off.  About half way through the drop, the light stopped very briefly, then started again until it was out of sight. It could have been a number of things, but I wanted to post in case anyone else saw this.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I looked up in the sky and saw 3 bright reddish orange lights.  They moved from NW to SE for about 15 seconds before disappearing.  I figured I was seeing flares but I remember thinking it was odd that they were in such perfect line, were glowing steadily and disappeared at perfect intervals, one after the other. I was with friends but didn't think to tell them as everyone would say they were fireworks (which would be a very logical conclusion, given the time and place). It wasn't until I read reports here on the NUFORC website that I even thought twice about the event.  If people from various parts of Washington all saw these lights at roughly the same time, the lights must have been higher than flares or fireworks.

While there, I witnessed an object travelling from the east at a slow speed, at a relatively low altitude (higher than a sea place off Lake Union, lower than a jet taking off from Sea-Tac, if that makes any sense). I could not make out the general shape of the object, but did observe that it had one large red light, and a smaller orange light next to, and seemingly behind, the red one. The object executed a shallow turn, gradually heading south. It suddenly appeared to stop, and hovered for several seconds. About this time, an identical object came from same direction, following a seemingly identical flight path. It also stopped, and hovered slightly behind the first object. After it began to hover, a third identical object came into view, and fell into formation behind the previous two. The three objects hovered in what I can only describe as a loose crescent formation, for at least 30 seconds. Shortly after the appearance of the 3rd object, I stuck my head in the apartment and told my roommate they should come and see this. They came outside, and witnessed a good deal of the event. Sometime after the 30 second mark, the first object floated upwards and disappeared. Following this, the remaining objects moved closer together, and almost seemed to touch one another. They then separated, hovered for a few more seconds, and finally drifted upwards and disappeared as well. I would estimate the entire event, from the appearance of the first object to the disappearance of the latter two, was about 90 seconds to 2 minutes in duration. Though, frankly, it's difficult to say as I was more than a little surprised to be seeing this, and thus wasn't paying attention to the time. These clearly were not fireworks of any kind. Also, the lights on these objects were not consistent with what I've witnessed on traditional aircraft. There was no white/clear light, and none of the lights on the objects blinked or flashed at any time. They were also silent, and seemed to have a slight wiggle in their movements. There's a lot of air traffic in my area, so I see planes and helicopters every day. I feel safe in saying these objects were very odd, in both their behavior and appearance. Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Bright light headed East, swerving, boosting, pulsing. stopped, continued east, beam came from center. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.  PD));2009-07-09 22:30:00;3 minutes;Bright light headed East, swerving, boosting, pulsing. stopped, continued east, beam came from center. I was walking down the street with a close friend of mine when I saw a extremely bright light moving east in the sky, I know it wasn't a plane because it was so bright and there was absolutely no blinking. I figured it was a satellite, but it was huge, easily 3/4 of a centimeter in diameter, and BRIGHT, we watched it move in a straight line east for almost a minute then everything changed it started accelerating for another 10-20 seconds then it briefly stopped, for just a moment, maybe half second then it headed east again. But now it wasn't moving in a straight line it was boosting kind of swerving but every time it made a movement not eastward it was really fast. It was also kind of pulsing or breathing the light never got darker, just brighter then back to normal. By this time it had moved from kind of over head/off my right temple at 2 o'clock to 3/4 maybe less of the sky towards the horizon. At that point it was about to become obstructed by trees so i jumped on my bike and went as fast as i could to get a better view. i got to a clearing in the trees on my street and there it was still moving east i watched for another 5 seconds before a more white/blue, like a clean white color (as apposed to the color of the rest of it which was more of a white/yellow) beam came from the center of it, the beam was 1 1/2 centimeters long and from where i was almost paper thin looking like a millimeter in width, it continued east still swerving with the beam for another 10-15 seconds it was almost to the horizon and i lost it in some trees. whole sighting lasted between 2-3 minutes. Most amazing thing i have ever seen in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the ISS.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
large white lighted craft viewed over seattle, wa;2009-09-03 20:00:00;10 minutes;large white lighted craft viewed over seattle, wa On thursday evening at around 8:00 PM my boyfriend and I went out on his back deck to have a cigarette.  The sun was setting so I was staring at the horizon enjoying the evening. I saw what appeared to be a very large star on the southwest horizon.  I pointed it out to my boyfriend who said it seemed too large to be a star.  We considered it might be a plane, though the light was consistently a glaring white and it appeared to be stationary.  We also discussed the possibility that it was Venus, though it was still light enough outside  I didn't believe Venus could shine that brightly. We watched the object for almost 10 minutes, the light never varied in intensity, it didn't appear to move, and slowly my boyfriend lost interest.  He turned away from the edge of his deck to face me.  As he turned around, the object made a swift and increadibly unexpexted swoop to the north.  Flying faster than any commercial aircraft I've ever seen, the object vanished behind trees to the north within seconds.  There appeared to be solid red lights on the object from this angle.  I caught my boyfriend's attention just in time for him to catch the object's departure.   We were both amazed and shocked by what we had witnessed.

Bright, flickering orange light;2010-01-18 20:15:00;2 minutes;Bright, flickering orange light Walking southward on sidewalk, coming back from taking out garbage. Saw to SE (over neighbor's house) object, about 30 degrees elevation, first thought it was aircraft with landing lights. Single bright light, orange/red similar to color of sodium lights moving slowly toward me (moving to the north west). Light was flickering irregularly but not blinking in a pattern, no other color lights seen. No sound from object, closing from ~ 4nm to 2nm (estimated based on ceiling and elevation, 2nm being about 11,000' directly overhead). Single-engine propeller aircraft heard to the northwest, apparently over water, but not correlated to the object. Based on altitude of 11,000' (reported ceiling) speed credible for either jet or turboprop aircraft, not credible for balloon (too fast) or meteor (too slow). Also based on observation that object entered cloud cover from below and did not emerge from it, object assumed to be gaining in altitude throughout observation. Went inside to get binoculars (just inside front door) and 10-y/o daughter. Went back out, object still visible, now moving faster (probably same speed but closer), now clearly having turned perhaps 45 degrees to the left and moving toward the west. Nearly overhead, observed with binoculars, slowly disappeared into clouds. Still no sound. Not seen again. Flight path not consistent with Boeing Field or Seatac. McChord AFB possible but unlikely. Note: Both Weather Underground site (copied below) and Boeing Field report clear skies, but actually heavily overcast, altostratus. Weather Underground also reports light northerly wind, but actual observation was southerly at 5 knots. Daughter (10 years old), also had binoculars but was unable to get them out of case in time and only saw it with unaided eyes, descibes as a fireball in the sky, like a very very furry animal's tail, while the animal's tail was poofed up, like a very angry cat's tail. Note: Daughter did not see object (she had been inside) until it was entering the clouds, I think this is what she means. Prior to that the object was a very distinct single source of light. Other than the fact that the object was not in a typical flight path, nothing about it's movement or speed seemed irregular for a conventional jet or turboprop aircraft. What was striking was it's coloration, and the fact that it was clearly flickering or flaring, but not blinking in any regular pattern. Also substantially brighter than conventional aircraft. Personal Background: Ex-Navy (navigation), captain US Merchant Marine, celestial navigation instructor, astronomy major in college (i.e., no, it wasn't Venus, a meteor or the ISS). Daughter is a typical ten-year-old, but has been stargazing with me since she was a toddler. Note: Your form asks for shape and number of craft. I do not presume to know if this is a craft or a natural phenomenon or something else entirely.

Strange orange light hovering in the sky seen during ISS visible overflight.;2010-06-26 22:39:00;2 Minutes;Strange orange light hovering in the sky seen during ISS visible overflight. In the Crown Hill section of Seattle I was observing the Space Station flyover that started at 22:35 local time.   After the ISS reached its zenith and was getting lower in the north-east sky I observed an orange reddish light in the sky to the north.  It was hovering near the constellations of Cepheus and Cassiopea.  It was nearly motionless though it appeared to move vertically very slowly during the two minutes it was visible. The orange reddish light had a flickering appearance and was slightly larger than the apparent size of the ISS and was much less bright than the ISS.  My best guess on apparent magnitude would be roughly 1.0. After two minutes the light disappeared from sight.  The light made no sound and appeared to be roughly 2-4 miles away.  It had no navigation lights, anti-collision strobes or landing lights like the normal air traffic in this area.  The local visibility was excellent with no clouds in the sky and no haze. The closest approximation to what I saw would be sky lanterns made from dry cleaning bags but this looked different.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Bright orange/red light orb seen over Gasworks Park, Seattle just moments before fireworks show.;2010-07-04 21:50:00;30 minutes;Bright orange/red light orb seen over Gasworks Park, Seattle just moments before fireworks show. On July 4th 2010, I witnessed a bright orange/red light in the sky approximately 9:30 pm.   At first the light was Southeast of my home in Fremont (Seattle neighborhood)I estimate it hovering above Gasworks Park area.  I thought it was an airplane.  My family and some friends walked south down our street to 34th Ave and Stone Way in Fremont to watch the fireworks show.  It was then approximately 9:50 pm and I noticed the same light in the sky.  This time the light was in a southwest position near the Aurora bridge and possibly 2 miles high in the air, I would say equal distance above Lake Union between Queen Ann hill and Fremont.  It seemed to hover in this area for 5 minutes and was much larger than an airplane light.   My family and friends commented on this orb of light with some other people waiting to see the fireworks show.  This was definitely not fireworks or other aircraft.  It stayed in one spot for 5 approximately mintues and then moved straight up in the sk! y.  The light was so bright it could be seen through the light clouds and was gone in about 10 seconds maybe less.   The light orb did not travel in any direction, just straight up.   I did not see the light again.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

A moment later I looked up again and saw two lights (only slightly smaller and less bright than the planet) below Jupiter.;2010-10-19 18:30:00;5 seconds;Just after dusk, I was bicycling to work on a local bike-path. I was marveling at the brightness of the moon and the alignment of Jupiter just below it. A moment later I looked up again and saw two lights (only slightly smaller and less bright than the planet) below Jupiter. My first thought was that they appeared to be dripping from the planet. They were very slowly falling, approximately equidistant from one another and the planet. Their motion reminded me of the slow drift of a flare in the sky, though this most certainly was not anything like a flare. I stopped my bike to watch and my heart began to race as I realized they were not airplanes. I have lived in this city my whole life and am very keenly aware of the flight paths over the city, as well as the movement of lights emitted from airplanes. These two lights were very far away, extremely bright white and not flashing or irregular in any way. They paused their motion for a moment, then rapidly flew away into the distance, with a trajectory that made them appear to be moving directly away from me. (No lateral movement.) The whole sighting took approximately 5 seconds. Of course, I don't know what I saw but I can say with great certainty that I have NEVER seen anything move that way in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness  elects to remain totally anonymous.  The report may have been submitted by the person who called our Hotline, but we have no way to document that fact.

Bright Light with Tail SSE travel over N.W Region US 7:40 AM 12/29/2010;2010-12-29 07:40:00;15 min;Bright Light with Tail SSE travel over N.W Region US 7:40 AM 12/29/2010 Viewed light on the way to work to the left of the moon.  Light visible in daylight. What was unusual about this was the light was high in the sky with a tail and not a planet.  This was not stationary.  My questions are three fold: 1) space station but why would it have a tail ?  2) Satellite in decaying orbit ? 3) Did we have a comet pass close by ?  And to add a forth given the recent reports - was this a high flier leaving a con-trail ?  (high flier being UFO as in unidentified object) not implying anything but 'unidentified'.  Flight path was straight and a SSE direction over the North West region and to the left of the crescent moon which at the time appeared overhead but in a Southerly 10 O'clock position, so not directly overhead. I am thinking space junk or Earth born stuff rather than other worldly craft. It was a bright light so you couldn't identify it as a craft with the naked eye and I didn't have binocs or telescope. I am a tech. and applicati! on Admin. Attention to detail is required.  Bare in mind I viewed this from a moving vehicle and could not stop to get a better look. So better details could not be gathered. Over the period of 1hr 1/2 commute the object was visible for 15 minutes as it wafted it's way South. I might note that the size never diminished as is the case with meteorites and this was not a flash of a meteorite. The size stayed the same relative to the distance of course as an object gets smaller over distance and time. It would be interesting to know what it was.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Vibrant Orange Lights jump in and out of the atmosphere over Seattle;2011-02-02 21:00:00;3 minutes;Vibrant Orange Lights jump in and out of the atmosphere over Seattle On February 02, 2012, around about 9:00 PM Pacific Standard Time, I was standing outside of my apartment building smoking a cigarette. I happen to look up at the moon and notice three orange lights flying low like helicopters heading west towards downtown Seattle.  I did not think too much of them because of the air traffic we have in my neighborhood and the fact that we see helicopters in the air at that altitude all the time.  My first thought was that those helicopters lights are really bright.   As they flew over my head they started “orbing” (best way to describe it)this vibrant Orange which startled me. Immediately I ran to grab my camera.  By the time I got back outside to capture the phenomenon they were already in the distance passing over downtown Seattle in a pyramid formation.   As I filmed them there were two other witnesses trying to get my attention on a fourth one, but, unfortunately I had headphones on and did not hear him until the last moment when it disappeared.  That is when the other three started doing the same thing only they kept reappearing.  It looked as if they were jumping in and out of dimensions, in the same location at first but then in different locations.  They commenced to return to the same area they had just disappeared from.  When they reappear they clearly displayed some sort of controlled Aerial Synchronicity.  There were three other people walking up the hill oblivious to what was going on above them.  It wasn’t until I pointed it out that they noticed. The airport is just down the way...I’ve been living here in this neighborhood long enough to know the air traffic where I live and I am conscious enough to know what is ours and what is  not.  To my knowledge, none of our air craft's disappear then reappears in different areas of the sky nor do they jump in and out of the atmosphere as if they have the ability to open star gates into inner space. In any case, I have the phenomenon on tape, if only I had my camera the whole time I would have capture them at a lower altitude doing their “orbing” thing…bottom line, man made air craft, do not jump in and out of the atmosphere and relocate in a different area in the sky in an instant.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Star-like light with humanly incapable flight pattern;2011-10-25 23:00:00;About 1 Minute;Star-like light with humanly incapable flight pattern I frequently like to go outside or look out my window at the stars. A few times in the past five months. I have noticed what looked like stars (or indistinguishable from stars) flying across the night sky. The first time in August 2011, my girlfriend and I watched two fly across the night sky in the Nevada desert, about 100 miles North of Reno. They were far apart and were obviously not a single aircraft. The lights were traveling South-East to North-West at exactly the same rate of speed, never altering the distance between themselves. They took nearly twenty seconds to make their way out of our sight. The second sighting occurred in November 2011. I was walking to my car after eating at a McDonalds 16 miles South of Seattle, when I looked up and saw a single star-like light traveling across the night sky. I proceeded to watch the light for about one minute as it made it’s way out of my range of sight. I immediately called my girlfriend to tell her. However, on Christmas night 2011, I was staring out my bedroom window (not far from the previously mentioned McDonalds) when I saw a star-like light flashing between white, red and blue while producing very peculiar flight patterns. The light would jolt randomly within a very small radius as it made a linear path across the night sky. The due path was South-East to North, while the jolts were sporadic in direction. The time for this light to traverse the night sky was also about one minute. I am sure this object was not an illusion produced by the lights on the underside of an airliner due to the elevation, the apparent movement of the single light and no appearance of aircraft body within the jolting radius. Also, a satellite has no way of producing this random jolting. This occurrence was by far one of the most bizarre things I have ever witnessed. I even woke my girlfriend up to ask if she could see what I was seeing and she was just as amazed as I was.

Each moving independently of each other at a constant speed (about the speed you would expect an aircraft would fly in the city) and in slightly different northerly path.   The lights appeared low enough that if they were aircraft an engine would be heard, but they were silent.  Once the first two had flown far enough north to start to dim, another light was seen moving from south to north along the same line, about a minute later another, and then another minute later, another light.  All were watched to the point of them being far enough north that they dimmed and could no longer be seen.

Ibasically watched them for a couple minutes, transfixed.  They flew up and over my apartment so I couldn’t see them anymore.  I thought about going outside to follow them, but I was a little freaked out.  Last time I saw a strange light in the sky was about fifteen years ago.

I saw about 8-9 red-orange lights hover over the Eastside of Seattle and change formations from triangles and lines before disappearing;2012-06-29 22:33:00;4 minutes;I saw about 8-9 red-orange lights hover over the Eastside of Seattle and change formations from triangles and lines before disappearing UFO Sighting Friday June 29, 2012 at 22:33-22:37 Seattle, WA – Looking to the East from Lake Union towards Lake Washington/ Bellevue/Kirkland area  Ok, so I was standing with a friend on their balcony overlooking  Lake Union to the East with a 180° view of Seattle from southern University of Washington campus to the North East of downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill. It was about 22:33pm on Friday June 29,2012 and while we were talking I was looking at the view and I looked at my friend (who had his back to the view in the east) for about 4sec, when I looked back up behind him I had seen that three red/orange lights (about twice the size and brightness of the star cluster of Sirius on a clear winter night) were sitting in a large equilateral triangular formation over (what looked like from northern Capitol Hill to the junction of I-5 and SR-520 East). As we watched (which the whole duration of the event was over a period of approximately 4min) the triangle started to move slowly to the north an upwards (from my perspective it would be approximately 1mph). As the triangle formation of red/orange lights moved, another light ! of the same color (red/orange), size, and brightness appeared about 450meters up and 300 meters to the north of the triangle appeared. Then the light began to slowly move north at around 5mph (from my perspective) and a greater speed to the east towards Kirkland before slowly fading out. As this occurred, four lights of the same original intensity and color as the initial triangle (which at this point was still in formation) of lights began to appear from behind Capitol Hill to the east and appeared in a straight line, one after, another (and these moved up quickly (from my perspective 10-15mph)  before slowing to a stop) in a perfectly straight line (which would bisect the lower southern corner of the triangular formations roughly 45° angle if drawn through the four new lights, connecting to the bottom , southern corner light, and through the equilateral triangle itself). As the four new lights were appearing, the triangular formation began to form into a line perpendicular with the horizon. What was the top light of the triangle began to move into the original spot of the light which hovered about the fir! st triangular formation before disappearing. This light then moved in the same direction and speed as the light before it had before slowly disappearing in the north, but mainly east (east towards Houghton and as far north as the University of Washington campus). The new four lights that had come up in a line to the bottom, southern corner of the triangular formation began to move upwards at approximately (from my perspective about 5mph). As these lights moved upwards, the top ones would take the spot of the others before it and would hover in a single spot before moving slightly north to the east and slowly fade away. The last four lights had moved upwards and the first four had pretty much disappeared in the distance by now (It was about 22:36) when the first of the four new lights moved into the upper position to the north east. The three lights below it then went into a small equilateral triangle formation (within approximately less than 100meters of each other). These three lights then moved into another formation forming a perpendicular line with the horizon before gradually moving up and to the north east before fading away. I feel crazy writing this, I believe in UFOs but my friend doesn’t but neither of us is sure what we saw. We watch airplanes (both commercial and military) helicopters come in for landing and move across the city skyline every night but never have we seen anything like this. The lights did not blink like airplane lights would and they were more orange than red. But they weren’t to be mistaken with airplane headlights either. Airplane headlights are a white/yellow light and accompanied with the green, red, and white wing and taillights. I have never seen any aircrafts fly like this and make these formations and possess these lights. Airplanes which are able to hover in the way which these lights/possible crafts did are extremely loud and can be heard from miles away. There was no sound accompanying these lights in the sky. I know what I saw, I can’t explain what it was but I don’t think it was normal. I hope my descriptions of my sighting can be understood and can help. By th! e time we really believed that this was for sure an unusual sighting and set up the camera to take a photo, the lights had faded too much in order to get a quality photo of them. I called the National Weather Service here in Seattle and they reported that the winds were coming in from the south at the time and area of the sighting.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Saw numerous red-orange objects moving slowing in north to south and also south to north in Seattle over a 20 minute period during Lake;2012-07-04 21:00:00;30 minutes;Saw numerous red-orange objects moving slowing in north to south and also south to north in Seattle over a 20 minute period during Lake union fireworks show.  Was on a party boat with others out on Lake Union waiting for the fireworks to begin (and no drinking!).  Saw the first (and single) object moving slowly from north to south directly over our head.  At first thought it was a helicopter, but had an orange/red glow and no navigation lights and no sound.  Then thought it might be an airplane at high elevation catching the sun.  It moved south and then disappeared.  Thought it may have gone into the shadow of the earth. Perhaps 10 minutes later saw two similar lights/objects moving from south to north and far to the south.  Very close together it seemed and too close to each other to be airplanes.  They disappeared as they moved to the north.  Which seems odd if they were entering the earth’s shadow, as the first one disappeared as it was heading south.  There may have been one or two lights/objects off to the east at this time. Then during the height of the Lake Union fireworks show about 15 minutes later there were numerous lights/objects (five?) far off to the east moving north to south, with two of the objects close together.  They disappeared as they moved slowly to the south, but did not disappear at the same time, and also did not disappear at the same latitude (so perhaps not due to the earth’s shadow).  All of the sightings lasted for perhaps 1 to 2 minutes before they would disappear.  Other than the two possible pairs of objects, they were not in any formation. I live outside of the city of Seattle but am tempted to head back tomorrow night, and it should be similar weather conditions, to see if this occurs again which may indicate that it is a normal occurrence of airplane reflections.  But that did not seem to be the case.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Bright white light seen over west seattle on august 3rd, 2012.;2012-08-03 21:30:00;2 seconds;Bright white light seen over west seattle on august 3rd, 2012. I saw an unidentified flying object over west Seattle Friday, august 3rd, and 2012. It was a bright white light, with a hint of blue.  It appeared for 2-3 seconds, made a circular motion, and then just disappeared. I told my friend what I had seen, and when I turned to see if I could spot it again it appeared behind a tree and disappeared after 1 second.  There was no alcohol or drugs involved, neither of us have a history of delusions.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Lights hovering over Lake Washington;2012-09-20 04:30:00;20 seconds;Lights hovering over Lake Washington Woke at 4:30 am and out of my apartment kitchen window - which faces right across Madison Park Beach and to Lake Washington- I saw 2 lights gliding at very low altitude and very fast speed above the water.   One light was red (the smaller and 1st of the 2) and the second was white.  They were right next to each other- may have belonged to the same object or both just traveling at the same speed & height.   Did not observe any type of interaction with the water nor water resistance like I have seen with previous,daily water vessels or planes.  No obvious sound heard.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
[seattle] Chain of 8 equally spaced, fast moving constant orange lights over Cascades, Western Washington.;2012-09-29 19:58:00;3-4 minutes;[seattle] Chain of 8 equally spaced, fast moving constant orange lights over Cascades, Western Washington. My location was on Queen Anne, near Fremont Bridge facing east over Lake Union, Lake Washington and the Cascades.  Clear night, moon was approx 20deg up from horizon (google sky map &quottime travel&quot feature could give more accurate detail).  Was about to mount my motorcycle, stopped, took helmet off and stood in driveway.  First sighting was a fairly bright orange/somewhat red light passing visually just below the moon heading south.  I tried to rationalize the sight, looking for a 'tail' of a comet, asteroid, blinking strobes of an airplane.  Nothing made sense, no modulation of light, no strobes, no other color lights and it was nearly as bright and big as the red 'strobes' on the I5 bridge.  Speed was about a palm width every two seconds.. also strangely fast.  As soon as the light had traveled about 4 palm widths at arms length across the sky, another showed up on the same exact path, same speed, same brightness.  My view of where the lights had o! riginated from was obscured by a large apartment building across the street.   The original light continued on its path, followed by the other, quite a distance (maybe another four or five palm widths).  By this time, with the exact same spacing and speed, another light had appeared just left and below the moon.  There were three visible at this moment.   The original light became dim, flickered and within a palm width distance was gone.  I made a couple of phone calls, of which my neighbor answered and was walking down Dexter Ave and into the driveway at that moment.  He and I watched a remaining four or five, as a total of 8 lights traveled the same path, the same speed and with the same exact spacing across the sky, flickering and disappearing at the same exactly spot in the sky (except the last one).  The last light made a path, arcing visually 'higher' than the others and flickered out at the same timing/distance as the others.   I wish I could have seen it from my bal! cony, as I'm sure by the intensity of light, and how mathemati! cally sp aced and accurate they appeared, they would have created a chain of lights throughout the horizon.  I work in IT as a programmer, have been a military aircraft enthusiast since a very early age, and for whatever reason didn't think to use my phone for video.  To note:  There were other aircraft in the sky throughout the sighting, commercial airliners and a small prop plane.  I could hear the prop plane clearly, but nothing else out of the ordinary.  Every airplane in the sky had distinct red/green/white strobes, and were of 'normal' speed.  The flight path of commercial airliners normally fly west towards my apartment, then bank close enough that in most cases I can make out the branding/logo on the planes (in daylight).  After this sighting, throughout the night all of the commercial airliners were making their turns towards seatac much further away (east) than usual.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Lights heading for a collision in the sky over Seattle;2012-11-01 20:45:00;<2 minutes;Lights heading for a collision in the sky over Seattle I recently moved to Seattle from New Mexico.  It had been raining for four days straight when suddenly there was a break in the clouds.  I decided to go outside on my balcony to enjoy the stars, since I miss the New Mexico night skies, and also smoke a cigarette.   As I was looking at the stars, I noticed a circular light, a little bigger than the size of a star in the sky, moving in a straight line above me from the north heading south.  Out of the corner of my eye, I see another circular light, the same size as the first light, coming in from the right (west) perpendicular to the first light.  At first they weren’t moving too fast but as the lights got closer to each other, the speed increased.  It appeared as though they were heading for a collision at this point.  I was sure they were going to hit and cause some sort of explosion but instead they began spinning around each other, making what looked like figure 8s.   This lasted only a few seconds before both light! s continued heading south parallel to each other(side by side). As the lights got further away, they began to slowly separate and disappeared into the clouds.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Apparent intensity was of a laser pointer seen from a distance. After approx 3 minutes the 'higher' of the two lights extinguished in a blinking/fading fashion, and 30 sec later the other did the same. Observer changed locations at the time of event to ensure this was not a localized reflection or similar.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Glowing light hovering over north Seattle.;2013-01-02 01:45:00;15 minutes;Glowing light hovering over north Seattle. Looked as if a helicopter hovering, but it was very bright in a yellow tinted incandescent looking glow maybe 1000' above the ground.  I could not hear any helicopter sounds.   It was in a very highly populated area of Seattle, other drivers on the freeway were noticing it too.  The light looked as if it was projected from a directional source laterally but had light emitting on all sides.  It did not seem to be aiming its light at anything in particular.  Nothing on the ground or trees appeared to be noticeably lit from the light.   I saw it while driving for about 10-15 minutes then exited the freeway and lost sight of it.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

My girlfriend saw something moving that she quickly turned my attention to, and as soon as I did the moving object lit up like a shooting star and picked up a bit of speed heading toward the Big Dipper, specifically the star that seems like it's connecting the cup and the handle of the dipper.   Once it got to that star, the UFO lit up a couple of times, before changing direction and started to head a right above the cup.    The star that it flew by seemed to glow brighter as the UFO passed it, and the UFO was now past the right-most stars of the Big Dipper and seemed to dim.   Then, to the left of the dipper, we saw what seemed like a shooting star this time.  It lasted as long as a shooting star was supposed to.  We thought it was odd we would see that in addition to what we had just seen.  Only a few moments passed when we saw the same looking object, this time going from left to right along the handle and moved down the cup once the handle ended.  It disappeared again. We saw the same looking object 3 more times, all around the big dipper.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I noticed three reddish orange orbs of light moving south from over lake Washington towards Renton.  What was strange is that they all had one pulsating light and it was large and slightly diffused.  Over the course of the evening I had noticed numerous typical plane and helicopter lights passing over downtown.  They all had a series of different fine pinpoint colored lights flashing such as red with flashing white, green etc. The three lights silently passed by and headed south. Strangely there were not fading lower into the horizon, as you would expect. Other aircraft with blinking green/white lights was following the horizon and fading into the lower atmosphere. These crafts were flying a direct line of site from their current altitude to about 40-50 degrees into the sky. This means they were not flying in parallel to the ground but descending up. I quickly pointed this out to the group I was with and they immediately noticed they were not typical aircraft.  At that point they began to quickly disappear into the sky as if they were leaving the atmosphere.    About a minute later three more red/orange orbs appeared on almost the same path. Their characteristics were similar but the third light seemed to quickly speed up before vanishing. The weather that night was crystal clear. The moon was out stars were visible. There were no smoke or vapor trails behind the lights. They moved way to fast to be flairs. They were not moving into the horizon like a typical craft but were disappearing into the upper atmosphere. They did not have a series of flashing lights but a slightly pulsating light with a reddish orange glow. This was definitely not like any craft I have seen before. The details were very similar to other events posted here as recently as June and July 2013.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Darting amber glow moving hummingbird-like through the clouds east of capitol hill in Seattle at 3:30am;2013-08-10 03:30:00;15-20 seconds;Darting amber glow moving hummingbird-like through the clouds east of capitol hill in Seattle at 3:30 am I went to the top floor of my friend's apartment bldg. on Capitol Hill to have a smoke.  I stood facing east toward Bellevue, looking at the blinking lights of the transmitter towers at the top of the hill.  We had a brief electrical storm earlier so the sky was just a big cloudy haze.   Suddenly, I see something in my peripheral to the right of the tower, a dim amber colored glow moving through the haze of the clouds.  My first thought was that it was the glow from airplane lights reflecting off the haze.  But now that I was looking at it directly I could see why it couldn't possibly be an airplane.  The flight pattern was too erratic.   I couldn't see what the glow was emanating from but whatever it was was zipping through the clouds at unearthly speeds and darting around like a hummingbird.  The glow also seemed to be too dim for plane lights.   It moved from the right of the towers to the left in about ten seconds which would be a considerable distance for a plane to travel in that small of a period of time.  Then it quickly faded out like it turned itself off.  I watched for another two minutes or so.   Called my buddy downstairs on my cel and told him what I saw.  He said he was coming up for a look himself.  While I waited for him I kept watching the sky.   About a minute after that the glow comes moving through the clouds in it's rapid darting fashion but this time it's coming from behind me, from the west moving east.  I quickly call my friend demanding he get up there.  I saw it again!  Get up here! I said.   We watched the skies for another 15 min or so but other than a few, what I presume, were lightning flashes off to the distance in the east, the glow didn't return.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Light in Sky Warps towards space.;2013-09-18 21:30:00;10 seconds;Light in Sky Warps towards space. On either Wednesday September 18th or Thursday September 19th my wife and I were enjoying a glass of wine on our porch.  I was looking into the clear night sky, reminiscing of my childhood summer evenings.  Where I slept outside under the stars noticing the occasional satellite pass over, dreaming of seeing a UFO.  As I was looking to the North at the  handle of the Big Dipper I noticed what I thought to be a satellite traversing the night sky.  I pointed it out to my wife and she also took notice. As the perceived satellite headed in a North Easterly direction it abruptly made what looked like an almost instant 90 degree arc towards outer space.  It diminished to nothing at that point in about 1 second as it passed the 3rd star in the  Big Dippers handle. We have inbound air traffic for Sea-Tac International airport.  I can tell you this was not a case of mistaken common phenomena in my area.  It was not a plane, jet nor meteorite (I have never seen anything burn up heading out of our atmosphere.  The object in question looked to be in a low Earth orbit.   It was definitely beyond the atmosphere of the planet.  Whatever IT was,IT was not conventional...;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

My wife and I saw an unusual light in the night sky while standing on the roof of our apartment building in the Ballard neighborhood of North Seattle.  The light sometimes appeared as two separate points, almost like green spots moving side by side, and at other times appeared as a single point emitting white light not unlike a star.  The light moved alternately in circular, saccadic, and up and down patterns.  The light moved much faster and in trajectory patterns that did not resemble that of familiar aircraft.  The phenomenon was observed to the west in the sky from our vantage point, and the distance was difficult to determine.  Near the end of the sighting the object appeared to descend toward ground level.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

At this point I look at my watch 01:45 am and realize no airplane nor shopper would move that fast nor that slow yet alone the sharp 90, 180 and 360 degree turns it was making on the fly without slowing down, this aircraft repeated the back and forward motion along doing the eight figure on the sky at different intervals like looking for something,  At this point I called security that never arrive, I continue looking at the aircraft over Crown Hill north of Ballard from were I was working at until I check my watch 01:56 am and lost the visual on the aircraft behind some buildings.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Three distinct orange lights moving silently very near to the Lake Union fireworks display.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;~5 minutes;Three distinct orange lights moving silently very near to the Lake Union fireworks display. Let me preface this by saying I have had these images for over a year now without thinking much about them, but it was reading Leslie Kean's book, UFOs:  Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record that gave me a clear understanding of the reality of this phenomenon.  After seeing the HUGE number of reports of objects similar to what I saw I felt I needed to report this. I was at Gas Works Park for the fireworks display last year and I had my iPhone out to try and take pictures of the Chinook helicopter that carries the American flag on a lap around Lake Union before the fireworks start.  As I was looking around the sky I noticed three bright orange lights moving around slowly making no noticeable noise.  I took three photos of the lights over the course of 1 or 2 minutes while I was pointing them out to my friends. There were aircraft in the air and skydivers coming down from them as part of the show, but I am convinced these lights were something different altogether.  I have gone skydiving and live next to a small airport and I know the sound of those small planes fairly well. As bright as these objects were they would have been making some kind of sound if they were small planes or helicopters. After watching them for maybe 5 minutes the fireworks show started and I don't remember seeing them during or after the show. Sending the three photos of the objects as well as a shot of downtown looking south from the same location.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Looking south just after 9pm, noticed two bright orange lights moving east to west.  They were separated by less than 5 degrees vertically and took about 1 minute to traverse about 25 degrees horizontally.  They were approximately 10 degrees below the half moon.  They appeared to lose brightness as they traversed the sky but remained clearly visible in the sliver of sky I was able to see.   No sooner did the tandem lights disappear from my field of view than another single light appear traversing the same piece of sky at about the same position of the lower light in the tandem grouping.  Same bright orange characteristic moving about the same speed.  The apparent magnitude of these lights were brighter than the brightest planet I have ever seen. They were not airplanes as I saw an airplane in the same section of sky and was easily able to compare the events.  I am an engineer working in aviation so know the difference.  In fact, I am attributing these lights to satellites reflecting the sun but since I have never seen three satellites traversing the night sky almost simultaneously and at that magnitude of brightness, I felt like I should report the event.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

White orb hovering slowly transitioning from white to red in color.  Lasted for about 40 minutes.;2015-03-05 11:00:00;45 minutes;White orb hovering slowly transitioning from white to red in color.  Lasted for about 40 minutes. I work on the 19th floor in Seattle.  I was sitting at my desk, I looked out the window and saw a glowing orb above Lake Union to the west, just hovering.   After about 10 minutes of watching it completely still, it slowly started gaining altitude and moving to the east, bery slowly.  Occasionally, I would lose sight of it, due to cloud coverage, but soon after the clouds passed, I would see it again, still moving very slowly and still gaining altitude.  I would see it often turn from white to red.  Not in a blinking fashion but in a very smooth transition from white to red.  This total sighting lasted about 40 minutes. Then I lost sight of it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be a very responsible, sober-minded person.  We suspect that she is a very reliable witness.

Off white point of light viewed from Seattle is seen altering course 3 times before vanishing;2015-07-04 21:30:00;30 seconds;Off white point of light viewed from Seattle is seen altering course 3 times before vanishing While sitting outside with a group of friends, I noticed an off-white (to orange) point of light.  I was facing west, the point of ligh was at a 10 o'clock position and heading in a southerly direction.  Instinct indicated an altitude of a commercial jet at cruising altitude, but it might well have been beyond the atmosphere.  What caught my attention was the lack of strobes.  We live just east of Boeing Field with it traffic as well as inbound/outbound flights from SeaTac are also clearly visible from our home.  I was beginning to think I was viewing a satellite, but it didn't have the look of something high enough to be in orbit, then it changed course.  It was at this point I pointed it out to others around me.   The object altered its course gently to a an easterly heading where it held that heading for maybe 5 seconds before gently altering to a southerly course which was held for 5 seconds. It then gently altered it course again to due west for about 5 seconds, before vanishing.   The area of sky covered would have been roughly the area of 2 fists held at arm's length, and the speed was roughly what satellites travel.  It was a constant smooth motion.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

At about 10:00 pm on Oct. 11, 2015, I took our dog out for a walk.  It's my habit to look overhead at the sky and clouds.;2015-10-11 22:00:00;20 minutes;Hi,   At about 10:00 PM on Oct. 11, 2015, I took our dog out for a walk.  It's my habit to look overhead at the sky and clouds.  This evening, I looked up and saw a light source going around and around. I stopped to watch it, to  try to figure out what it was.  I'm familiar with the way the way the attention-getting search lights used by businesses look when they shine up into the sky.  This was not like them.  This appeared to be a light source that was coming from above the clouds--not from below.  It was a diffused light, moving in a clock-wise direction and completing a circle about once every second.  The relative size of the source was about the size of a full moon.  It went on for about 20 minutes.  The circumference of the circle was hard to quantify, but I would estimate it to be about 5 to 10 percent of the overhead sky. I watched this light for about 20 minutes, as I walked the dog. It suddenly stopped--it didn't get smaller as if moving away--it simply stopped. I called it into! the Seattle Police Department and the person on the phone suggested I call the phone number for reporting UFOs. I called the number and spoke with a gentleman who asked that I submit a brief written description of the incident.  As a side note, I'm a photographer and used to observing light. This truly looked like a light source that was coming from above the clouds.  The area of this observation was from SW Monroe St and 39th Ave SW to SW Rose St. and 39th Ave SW in West Seattle, WA.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Regards,  John;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Approx. 12 reddish/orange lights over downtown Seattle.;2015-11-21 16:30:00;5 minutes;Approx 12 reddish/orange lights over downtown Seattle. Over a span of about five minutes, saw approximately 12 reddish lights in three loose formations traveling due west across downtown Seattle.  The formations were variations on chevron/arrow shaped, regularly spaced and formation was held without wavering. The lights were reddish orange in colour and did not pulse or flicker. There were no other lights that would indicate that these were aircraft navigation lights. No discernible shape of the light or craft.  No sound was heard over the background noise of the city. Unable to properly judge height, but based on the angle at which they passed behind a tall building, my angle to the building and assuming their speed was similar to that of a jet aircraft, I estimate that they were over 8,000 feet.

I saw bluish-greenish lights in the sky in northwestern Seattle, appearing like colored lightning or aurora borealis (but it was cloudy), and I didn't hear any explosions or other loud noises roughly in the area above the Ballard fishermen's terminal or Bainbridge Island. They appeared intermittently,  I recall 3 distinct illumination events, and then they rapidly faded out.  I can best describe it as appearing like blue lightning spreading through clouds, but did not see a distinct source of the light.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I observed an extremely bright light in the night sky above Seattle through my south-facing bedroom window.  The light was blue-green in color, and moved eastward across the sky at a rate of speed I have never seen in an object before. At first, I thought it may have been a meteorite, but there was no trail behind the light and it was moving in what seemed to be a controlled manner.  It also was moving faster than any shooting star I have ever seen.  There was no sound associated with the object. Planes frequently fly over my location, but there were no other lights observed and, again, it was moving too fast to be a plane.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Unusual red lights at apparent orbital  altitude.;2018-06-21 23:14:00;5 minutes;Unusual red lights at apparent orbital  altitude. I just witnessed something unusual - 8 red lights traveling from the direction of  the sunward horizon - West to East. The objects, by their action and the way the light dimmed, appeared to be at orbital altitude.  They came from the West and then progressively dimmed as they traveled toward the East. What makes it unusual is that the 8 objects appeared and disappeared within a span of approximately 5 minutes.  Also the red color was unusual as I am used to looking for sky junk and watching it pass overhead, but it is, in my experience, lit white by the reflected sunlight.  All came  from the same part of the sky in succession and were closely grouped. I don't know what to make of this but thought it unusual enough to report.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Red & Green Blinking lights (Airplane imitation) & Later A Red & Green Alternating Light Craft.;2019-01-25 18:20:00;5-10 minutes;Red & Green Blinking lights (Airplane imitation) & Later A Red & Green Alternating Light Craft. 1/25/2019 Green and Red Light Sightings, Seattle, Washington.  The First UFO  	I was driving home on I-5 North-bound, just South of Downtown Seattle coming from the West Seattle Bridge.  This was bout a week or a little more after the Alaska Way viaduct closed, so all the North-bound traffic was backed up on I-5, on top of the usual slow rush hour traffic of the Seattle area.  Barely creeping along, often stopped completely, I sat in what looked like a river of red lights in front of me.  Having little better to do than to look out my windshield and wait for the traffic to move, something out of the ordinary caught my eye.  It had red and green blinking lights on it, much like the airplanes that are frequently passing over Seattle to land at the Sea-Tac Airport South of the city.  What was different about this is that it was not moving, it was sitting stationary in the same place in dark sky. 	I watched this object blink with red and green lights like an airplane for several minutes, and it definitely did not move.  It was sitting in the sky, close to street lights, maybe a little bit higher, directly above the freeway packed with hundreds of cars.  When I got closer to it, it was still in the same place, I just watched it carefully, and it was not attached to a tower, (it was a little way south of the downtown skyscrapers), and not something attached to a street light either.  When I got close enough to try to capture a video of this object while I was stopped, but then the cars in front of me started to move again, so I had to move forward.  Just after I stopped again and got a good look at this object with red and green lights, it was still in the same spot, but it started rotating and I saw its white headlights at least twice.  After two or three rotations it started to slowly fly away from me, and disappeared over a hill to the southeast of where I was.  This was ! odd to me because all of the other planes I observed that night flew southward, toward either Boeing or Sea-Tac airports.  Because it started moving shortly after I was about to started filming, it would have looked like a normal airplane moving through the night sky. 	My feeling is that this object was a 3D hologram projection that looked like an airplane, but was most likely an alien craft in reality.  It was probably able to sense when I was about to start filming, and then it started moving after that.  I feel that it could have also been an ET craft with occupants aboard who were aware of me, and wanted to show me what they can do and/or give me a sign.  I have absolutely no idea if any other drivers or people in the area saw this object.  Multiple airplanes flew overhead while this object sat stationary in the air, below the level of the other planes.  Again, it looked like an airplane with a red and a green light that would blink every second or so. The Second UFO 	Later this evening, I was walking my dog in my neighborhood in Northeastern Seattle, when I looked up into one area of the clear night sky, I saw another unidentified object, also with red and green lights.  This second one appeared a lot like a large star in the sky, less radiant, but still colored light, but with alternating red and green lights, where the the earlier one had blinking red and green lights.  This second object also looked like one spherical light of alternating red and green, never dark.  I watched this object for at least a minute, and it was not moving through the sky, not like an airplane would.  When I got to a spot where I could try to film it with my iPhone, I zoomed in and could pick up something faintly, but then it started moving away from me, in a similar fashion as the earlier object.  As it was moving away from me in a northwestern direction, it was no longer green, and became a red blinking light. 	Both of the unidentified flying objects I witnessed on this night, of January 25th, 2019, hovered and moved silently as far as I could tell. Both moved very smoothly through the sky, and both seemed to know when I was watching and trying to film them.  I am certain these red and green lighted objects were not ordinary terrestrial objects, I have lived in Seattle all of my life and am very familiar with how airplanes and satellites look in the night sky.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Three high flying, slow moving objects holding formation during the daytime on a clear blue Sunday afternoon.;2019-03-31 17:50:00;10 minutes;Three high flying, slow moving objects holding formation during the daytime on a clear blue Sunday afternoon. My son and I had just gone for a bike ride around Greenlake in North Seattle because it was a very nice, clear afternoon. When we returned home a little before 6:00 PM, we were laying in the grass in the front yard looking up at the blue sky and noticed an faint object very high in the sky that was moving north to south at a slow speed.  It had the appearance of a white point of light, like a satellite, but it was during the daytime.  It appeared to be too high to be a commercial aircraft and it was moving too slow.  I thought it might be a satellite also because it appeared to almost drift at times, but then I noted it would make sudden bursting movements. After a few minutes, my son noticed another object and it appeared the two objects were approaching each other.  At that time, I called my wife and daughter outside and they could see the two objects as well.  Eventually, the two objects came so close together they seemed to briefly merge.  The two objects then separated and that’s when we saw the third object, but not before I saw a streak of light that resembled a faint meteor, streak near the objects. The three objects then held a tight triangular formation for a few minutes until their luminosity faded to the point where we couldn’t see them anymore.  Afterwards, we all discussed what we saw and we all agreed we saw the same thing.  This sighting was during broad daylight but one would have had to be looking straight up at the sky to see it, and even then you would have had to be focusing fairly intently to see and track the objects. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport - The objects were too far/faint to show up with the cell phone camera.  We tried with multiple devices but they just were not seen with the camera.  I would provide the information I provided you to the local media if they were interested.  But without video or pictures, I am not sure they would be interested.

So today I was at work doing my work routine.  my jobs laid back so I'm hanging out. Felt like I should look up towards the sun.  Saw light hanging some ways under the sune.  It appeared to be changing colors.  I kept in mind this could have been a airplane, but it wasn't I'm very used to spotting them.   I live near the main airport here.  And my job has route that fly above and near me.  This orb of light i would call seemed to be using the sun as cover.  I knew it was watching me.  It tried to hide behind a tree once I spotted it.  Like it darted and came to a complete stop.  Its movements were as if you were to move computer mouse and watch the arrow move.  Very swift and precise.   I was running to get my phone playing my music.  I knew I wouldn't make it.  So, I stopped and watched it just fade away.  I have seen this odd orb before.  When I have seen this type it sometimes splits into 3 orbs and takes off.  I don't like to call it a UFO.  It makes me look/sound crazy.  But this wasn't of earth.  And it's easier to dismiss than to prove fact.   I don't have many I can tell this to that believe me.  So here you go.  Hope someone else saw this.  Just so I help you feel less crazy.  You aren't.

I went back in the house thinking how weird that was and about 10 minutes later when I looked out the window I saw two more lights moving in the same exact path as before . I know it's impossible for a satellite to circle the Earth in ten minutes so I ran back outside to see what was going on , only this time new satellites kept appearing one after the other all in a perfectly straight line and all equally spaced until there were six of them moving out of the WNW passing close to Arcturus coming nearly overhead then dimming out one by one in ESE sky .They each took several minutes to fly! by .

It looked like the other stars, a bright light, with a slight aura. Then it suddenly began to move down towards the horizon, moving faster and more easily than a plane or jet, not on an entirely straight path, wavering a bit as it did so. It did not leave any trails or make any sound. It then stopped, and began making little forays to the sides and up, then moved horizontally a ways north along the horizon, and stopped again. It then moved back south again a little way along the horizon, stopped, and started making little forays up, down, and to the sides, and that is when I came in to report it, at 11:35pm.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

The lights were about 5 degrees apart in a east-west orientation in the close proximity to the star Altair and were not moving and looked exactly alike. After watching them for a few seconds the light to the east slowly dimmed out followed by the light to the west dimming out in the same manner. I ran outside to see if the lights would return or if I could find some more. After looking around the sky for a while, which was very clear at the time, I didn't see anything else unusual. I'm a amateur astronomer and I've seen plenty of satellites brighten and fade away, but these objects did not move! Never seen anything like it. They could have been there more than 15 seconds as the lights were already there when I looked out the window.   This was not Starlink!;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
