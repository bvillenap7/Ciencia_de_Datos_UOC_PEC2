The object caught my attention because of it's unusual color. We live on a high ridge between the Sea-Tac airport and Boeing Field, and are used to seeing all types of aircraft at all hours of the day and night. This thing was not like anything I've ever seen! I ran back in the house and grabbed my binoculars. My husband joined me in the yard where we watched it appear in the gaps between the trees, until it grew so small it disappeared. I estimate it followed I-5 southbound. The total elapsed time from first spotting it until it disappeared covered several minutes.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

As to size, distance and altitude if object is say 1000 ft long, it was 300 feet fat, about 3000 ft altitude and moving at over 600 mph.  There were no unusual  maneuvers.  Lost sight of object in trees as it seemingly moved South above I-5 corridor. After sighting, my wife called hotline;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

A solid object suddenly appeared over I-5 near the Shorleine exit.   It came into view without having traversed the sky. It was stationary against a clear blue sky. At arms length it would have measured one inch long by 3/16 inches high. It was solid grey with visible highlights and shadows. A band of whitish light started movng  from the right end  along it's length to the left end, when it reached the left end it started over on the right side. The band of light repeated this several times and then the object  suddenly faded -there were no clouds, no mist to obscure it's view. The object still sat stationary and the band of light was still pulsing along it's length, the only change was that the object no longer exhibited visible hightlights and shadows, it had a fuzzy out of focus appearance.  It then suddenly vanished without having changed it's position, shape or behavior.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

The ship was metalic with what appeared to be windows across the front. After a few seconds, it then rose back into the cloud overcast. Since I was driving at the time and I'm sure you are aware of how fast people drive on the expressways around Seattle, I didn't stop.  I don't know if anyone else saw the object.

Cigar shaped object with several blueish white lights on side sighted moving easterly over Queen Anne neighborhood;2000-09-02 04:00:00;2-3 seconds;Cigar shaped object with several blueish white lights on side sighted moving easterly over Queen Anne neighborhood I awoke at 4:00 AM to use the bathroom.  I heard a sound coming from outside that caught my attention because it was coming from the sky, but didn't have the focused, directional sound of a jet engine.  When I looked out my bathromm window (facing North) I saw a cigar shaped object with several blueish white lights on the side (roughly 1/3 to 1/2 way between the front and back). The object was flying fairly low in the sky in a singular, easterly direction and from it's size, it appeared to be fairly near.  I viewed the object for approximately 2-3 seconds before it flew out of the view of my window. The sound was still audible for a few seconds after I lost visability.  Slightly stunned, I returned to bed but was unable to sleep.  I got up again 1 or 2 minutes later but did not sight the object again. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally convincing in her description of her alleged sighting.  Please see other entries from across the U.

23:50 on 3/13/01, an object with orange lights flew at remarkable speed, silently, from south to north over Puget Sound.;2001-03-13 23:50:00;10 seconds;23:50 on 3/13/01, an object with orange lights flew at remarkable speed, silently, from south to north over Puget Sound. My girlfriend works nights and leaves our West Seattle home at about 11:45 each weeknight.  After she leaves, I often go out on the back porch to write in my journal.  The porch faces west, overlooking Blake and Vashon Islands and Puget Sound.  I had just stepped out on the porch and was admiring the clear night sky when an object traveling very, very fast crossed from the south to the north.  It caught my eye because I thought it was a shooting star, but then I realized that it was flying within earth's atmosphere. Moreover, it had least 3 distinguishable bright orange lights in an oblong formation.  It was too dark for me to make out the outline of the vessel itself. It flew at about the height on the horizon as a plane would, but was totally silent and at about 10 times faster -- it took about 10 seconds for it to cross the sky.  To reconfirm my thought that it could not possibly be a plane that had just passed, moments later one in fact did fly by (presumably coming from SeaTac airport as they often do), and I could make out its shape, hear it clearly, and it was much slower than what I had just seen. I took out my journal and wrote: 3/13/01: It's dark and I can't see to write well.  I just saw something cruise through the night sky.  It had orange lights and was very, very fast and completely silent.  A plane just flew by, too, but slower - much slower - and I could hear it pass.  It must have been a satellite but it seemed so close. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and believe the witness is an excellent source of objective information.  Very lucid, very eloquent, and a very clear on the object that was observed.  It is noteworthy that this report strongly suggests that there were multiple, individual lights on this object.

shiny cigar shaped thing with no wings;2002-07-26 02:00:00;1 minute;shiny cigar shaped thing with no wings This is the first sighting in a number of 4 that my sister and I have seen this summer...and our lives!  It was as we were crossing the 1-90 bridge towards west Seattle.   I asked my sister if she saw that weird thing in the sky...It seemed high in the sky yet pretty darn big because we could see it clearly. It was shaped like a jet but with NO wings or lights.  It was extremely shiny, unlike an airplane.  It appeared to float in the air.   We noticed other people were seeing it too.  It was DEFINATELY NOT an airplane or a blimp or anything else.  I was really confused on what to think because I have NEVER in my life seen a UFO.  So we chaulked it up to something weird until my sister and I saw two more strange things some time later in the summer.   My sister and brother in law saw a formation of shiny, bar shaped UFO's in the day sky near Federal Way.   It wasn't till we read another account of the shiny cigar shaped thing with no wings on the same day and same vacinity as we were in, that we decided to think again.  We looked at each other and decided we Need to report the things we have been seeing!;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

It moved roughly from the North to the South. We saw it move for several minutes and it was clearly visible there were no wings or tail fins. It was about 20 times as long as it was wide. There was absoutlely no sound. Aircraft later at the same height we were able to hear. There were no trails or lights. The sun was glaring to setting so we had a good look. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed a contrail behind a high-flying jet aircraft, although that is a guess.

Stationary daylight star with tail;2004-06-27 15:30:00;10 minutes;Stationary daylight star with tail My partner and I were in our backyard doing yardwork on Sunday afternoon around 3pm. I sat down on the porch to take a break and looked up into the blue sky. I saw a cigar-shaped object very high up that looked like a star with a faint white tail pointing downward. It did not appear to be moving. I pointed it out to my partner, who also saw it. The object was slightly to the northeast, at about 60 degrees from the horizon. I brought my telescope outside and attempted to view it, but I could not find it with the telescope. After about ten minutes the object was no longer visible. My partner and I are both in our 30s and college-educated.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Four bright cigar-shaped objects held their position high above the Cascades, side by side, for at least 40 minutes.;2004-08-09 08:00:00;approx. 1 hour;Four bright cigar-shaped objects held their position high above the Cascades, side by side, for at least 40 minutes. I work as a litigation paralegal for a law firm on the east side of the upper floors of the Bank of America Tower in downtown Seattle.  On Monday, August 9, 2004, at about 3 minutes past 8 a.m., I observed from one of the attorney's office windows 3 small gleaming objects that seemingly were reflecting the sun's light, located at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. The objects appeared to be either directly over the Cascade Range or to the east of the Cascade Range. These three objects were cigar-shaped and hovered in a straight line, side by side like three dashes, and remained in that position for several minutes.  I did not detect any movement from the objects, and I asked two other paralegals to come look. None of us had a camera or camcorder. We located a pair of binoculars and I was the first to look.  I observed that the objects were gray/silver metallic in nature and I think that I am correct in saying that they were reflecting the sun, and thus appeared bright.  The object on the far right moved upwards slightly, and as it moved in those one or two seconds, it did not gleam.  I suspect it was at such an angle as to not reflect the sunlight.  As it took its new position slightly above and diagonally to the right of the others, a fourth gleaming object came out from behind the object on the far left, and lined up with the other objects.  It looked similar to these dashes:    _ _ _ -  I asked the paralegal with me if she had just seen what had happened.  She said, Do you mean that the one on the right blinked and a fourth one came out on the left?  She took a turn looking with the binoculars. The objects just held the same position.  By now, it was approximately 8:25 a.m.  Although none of us were able to continually watch (I, for one, had a noon filing to prepare for the court), one paralegal and I were able to see these objects in their same pattern until at least 8:40.  With the sun changing position, the reflection disappeared, and it was difficult to see the objects anymore.  I cannot say exactly when the objects were no longer there.  By 9 a.m., I could not find them.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Cigar shaped object with two lights over Seattle;2004-09-12 11:11:00;10 seconds;Cigar shaped object with two lights over Seattle We spotted the UFO in West Seattle, the object was moving from east to west.  We were on a porch that faces east and the object was sighted when it was directly above us.  Two people saw it immediately and two did not, then when the all four were aware of it we went to the front door facing west.  This offers a good view of the sky to the west, but the UFO was not sighted, as it was travelling at a high speed, faster than a commercial airliner or private plane.  Only two people out of four actually viewed the object, as the other two were not in a good spot to see it.  The UFO seems to be ruled out as a meteor breaking up and displayed two sources of light, at either end of the object.  The form was seemingly cigar shaped.

A silver cigar-shaped object stationery in the evening sky over Seattle;2005-08-08 18:00:00;1 minute;A silver cigar-shaped object stationery in the evening sky over Seattle Monday early evening I was driving east in Seattle when I saw a large white or silver cigar-shaped object in the sky. It was directly ahead of me, maybe 1,000 feet in altitude. It had a shadow in the middle of the body that was kind of triangular-shaped like a wing might make, and I kept trying to make out a wing from it, as I see the large commercial jet airliners flying over daily. But it didn't conform to anything I could recognize. It had no windows, stripes or any features on the body except for the shadow shape. I realized it didn't taper at the tail as jetliners do. The long shape was perfectly even, and it seemed to be stationary in the sky. A few buildings blocked my view for a moment, and when I looked for it again it was gone. I looked very carefully but it just wasn't there. It was too high to have gone behind anything on the horizon. A mile or two later, still traveling east I saw it again, at the same altitude but a half mile or so south. It appeared to be stationary , as before. I see blimps flying around here and this was definitely not a blimp. Again my view was blocked by some trees and buildings, and a moment later when I got a clear view of the sky it was gone. I parked by Lake Union, with a wide open view of the sky, and tried to see it, but it was just gone. I did see a smaller plane in the distance flying from north to south, and it was easy to see it moving, compared to what I had just observed.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Bright object in sky fades away over Seattle;2012-08-09 09:03:00;1 minute;Bright object in sky fades away over Seattle I was traveling northbound on I5 (http://goo.gl/maps/PH2Za) while riding my motorcycle.  Having a helmet view of the sky I could see everything very clearly. It was bright and mostly clear. There were a few distant cirrus clouds but when I saw this object it was back-dropped by clear blue sky. The object was flat and bright and moving easterly and  at an approximate 4 or 5 degrees angle upward. The brightness of the object could have been sunlight gleaming from it but it was much brighter than one would normally expect even having sunlight bounce off of it. There was a gleam about the object that appeared to move on the object.  At first I thought that the object was a jet since this location is near Boeing, and to be honest, it could have been, I guess.  It was probably four or five miles from me, I estimate, and it was about an half-inch wide from my perspective. After watching this object for around 10 seconds the background of the object changed so that th! ere was a very distant and slightly transparent, small cirrus cloud.  As the object approached the location in the sky where the background became the cloud, the object could be seen completely until the last part of the object was forefronted to the cloud at which point the object slowly faded away.   By the time I saw the fading occur, I will admit that I was in a slight turn on the freeway which put me in a more north east direction. I continued to watch the location of the sky where the object existed. After a few seconds, I ended up in a more sharp curve putting me in a north direction of travel again while still maintaining as close an eye to that part of the sky without getting in an accident but that object never reappeared *anywhere* in the sky. The cloud in the back ground was small so any flying object would have left that area of the sky back into clear blue sky within seconds. This object did not and I was never able to see the object again after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
