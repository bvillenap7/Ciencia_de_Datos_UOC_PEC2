Pure round white light 20 feet in diameter floated directly over us at tree top level after midnight.;1986-07-15 00:00:00;30 seconds;Pure round white light 20 feet in diameter floated directly over us at tree top level after midnight. Seattle July 1986, after midnight sometime.  13 years old. Sleeping outside with a friend under a clear night sky, as we did quite often in the summer months.  We both were still very much wide awake not knowing the exact time when a pure round solid white light approx. 20 feet in diameter floated slowly and directly over the top of us at tree top level from east to west.  It lighted up the tops of the trees.  There was no noise, no wind, no vibration.  Moving slowly at maybe 1-2 mph.  Approx. 20 seconds total.  No reaction from us...couldn't talk or move from fear.   After it passed and was gone we both looked at each other and said let's get the hell out of here.  We hurried inside and went to sleep.  The very strange thing is we didn't talk about it at all.  Uncharacteristically, we both just went straight to sleep. Next morning, during breakfast, my friend brought it up to his dad and was scolded for lying.  We didn't talk about it again until years later as I moved out of state that month.  As adults years later our stories had one frightening difference.  My friend's recollection was that the object stopped briefly above us.  I remember it moving continuously until out of view.  Still bothers me to this day 33 years later. Also I was very keen on nearly every type of aircraft as it was my passion back then.  I had never heard anything of UFOs back then...  And I'd say the reason I didn't give chase in curiosity as I normally would have was out of fear.  I still haven't to this day been able to explain what it was or have I ever seen anything close to this object since then.

While stargazing, a dark black object entered into my line of sight and headed toward the city. Very fluid and fast. No sound. A little;2000-02-09 22:00:00;2-3 seconds;While stargazing, a dark black object entered into my line of sight and headed toward the city. Very fluid and fast. No sound. A little bit of light seemed to be reflecting off of the forward section of the object. Then it disappeared into the city glow. The time of my sighting is quite an odd coincidence and coincides with many events that are happening in my life. That particular night I was just feeling the cusp of a new contentness and so while hanging out with my friends in their upstairs apartment, I decided to go outside for a quick breather to be alone with myself. On the balcony (note: the balcony is only 2 feet of the ground), I was contemplating all the coincidences that had happened that entire week and even up to that day. I had no idea that something bizarre was also going to be added to the rest of them. Well I guess I felt frisky, so I hopped the balcony and walked over to the sidewalk and layed back to stargaze. We live in the Kinnear section of Queen Anne (the west side of the hill). And our apartments look out over Magnolia. I was only out on the sidewalk for a good five to seven minutes when the sighting occured. I want to stress the fact that I did ask for a sighting that night like so many other times I've done in the past but have been so awfully disappointed. My family does have a UFO/e.t. history so I thought I was being neglected, I should say. Before that night I had never seen a UFO or a visitor contact. To continue with my sighting I noticed a good amount of planes that night and I noted that they seemed to have more blinking lights these days. They may have always been that way, but maybe just now I realized it? I could hear all these planes just fine, but the object I saw made no sound at all. I must have been staring out into nothingness (basically straight up) when a dark object entered into my line of sight. I want to note that I did not see it coming out of the corner of my eye, but rather it entered very near to the exact spot I was looking at. I was a dark shadowy object that emitted no light and was heading sort of in a SSE direction toward the city. I believe when I first saw it, it was completely dark. But as it flew in toward the city I think it did start to reflect some city light (I only speculate here) on ! the forw ard section of the craft. As it drew near the glow of the downtown area it sort of faded away and disappeared. I'm not sure if it merely flew into a misty pollution of the city lights or if it purposely made itself invisible. Anyways, the object made no sound and I really have nothing to compare it's size to, since I was looking straight up. Compared to the other planes I saw that night it did seem like it was flying about as low as the normally can go, and it seemed more solid, as the object I saw was circular in shape. Also, when comparing the object I saw to all the rest of the planes that night. This object sort of swooshed in and was not using a direct line of flight. All the other planes up there seemed to be stiff and rigid in the flight plans, while this was like a bird swooping on in. That's about it. The important thing that this sighting has taught me is that, despite my family's history of seeing UFO's and E.T.'s, I am even now doubting my sighting. And unless an E.T. comes up to me and taps me on the shoulder, or a gov't agent comes up to me and explains the entire truth behind the whole enigma, all of us will have doubts. Descartes was really on to something I guess. Thank you.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

This was in my view about 6 seconds. The second sighting happened within 8 seconds behind the sighting mentioned above and this was an armada of at least 50 to 100 lights moving in the same path from the East to the West at the same apparent speed of the first sighting. The lights were like looking at a well lit city from an airplane where all lights were of the same color and intensity. The formation was a wide angle V taking at least a 10 degree angle of arc, tip to tip. There were more lights in the apex of the formation and these tapered off at the tips. All objects were in a tight formation, travelling at the same speed. the lights of were of equal brightness. Ther were a few objects in front of this formation and a few behind the formation travelling at the same speed and direction. No noise, a silent passing. Sighting lasted 6 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  This witness is known to us, and we consider him to be quite credible.  We spoke with him about his sighting, and he was able to describe it in objective fashion, and with considerable detail.  NUFORC has received multiple sightings of armadas of small lights, in some cases in precise, regular formation, and in other cases in irregular and changing formation.  We do not have an adequate explanation for these events.  A similar event is reported over Ontario, Canada, on February 09, 1913, which is well documented by astronomers, ships' officers, etc..  No adequate explanation for that event, termed the Cyrillid Meteor Shower, has ever been put forth.

Four circular objects over Seattle.;2001-09-15 19:30:00;5-10 minutes;Four circular objects over Seattle. i realize at this time that any UFO may well be military. nonetheless, this was unlike anything i've seen or heard reported, and thought it may help. i was standing at the water's edge of Myrtle Edwards Park in Seattle, looking up at the sky towards the southeast.  the sky was pink, as the sun had just gone down behind the Olympics.  i then noticed 3 tiny solid black circles moving from the south to the north in a triangular pattern. they seemed to be moving very slowly. theie size was to this scale: if i extend my arm, and stare at my index finger's nail, the size of one of the craft was a quarter of the entire size of my nail.  the 3 objects had no lights.  they were completely circular.  they then stopped and spread out into a line and just sat in the sky, it appeared to be VERY high...i could also see one or two planes in the sky, rather low, as they were on appraoch to SeaTac Airport, and these objects were tiny compared to the planes. i then noticed a 4th object...i did not see how it approached, i rather just suddenly noticed it moving upwards to meet the other 3.  i did not see it rise from the horizon... the 4 objects then moved , with an odd uniformity of movement towards the south.  not fast  or slow, just discreetely, i'd say...they faded from my view in approx. 1 minute once they began to move.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Two yellow-amber spheres one disappeared slowly, the other changed direction, stopped, & vanished.;2001-11-18 02:30:00;90 seconds;Two yellow-amber spheres one disappeared slowly, the other changed direction, stopped, & vanished. While observing the meteor storm, and about ten minutes after sighting a large, crescent shaped object (see previous report), I spotted a yellow-amber colored sphere or circular oject flying slowly from east to west.  There were no apparent lights on it, so at first I figured it must have been a balloon or a plastic bag caught up in a breeze. It flew slowly in a straight line, and slowly disappeared as it flew out over the water.  Plastic bags usually don't do this and aircraft normally have lights on them (this did not), so I shot at it with a 11.6 milliwatt 632nm (green) DPSS laser while it was moving away from my position, but did not see any light reflected back. Since I can see the beam from this laser slicing through the sky at night, targeting was not an issue it simply didn't reflect any of my green light back to me. About a minute later, I saw another, smaller one going in approximately the same direction at approximately the same speed and in approximately the same flight path as the first. I shot this one with the laser as it was moving off as well, and *did* manage to hit it several times as I saw the green dot light up on what I believe to be its underside.  After I'd hit it four or five times, it slowed down to almost a stop, abruptly turned to the north, and started moving again only more slowly.  I half expected the thing to start shooting back at me but instead, it slowed down again and came to a complete stop. By this time I'd thrown the laser to the floor and kicked it under the bed. Then the UFO just hung there stationary like a one of several of the other stars visible near its position. After observing it stationary in the sky for 25-30 seconds, it simply winked out as if somebody kicked the plug out of the wall. There were no visible light sources on them (they appear to have been illuminated solely by reflected light from below), no sound was detectable, and no moving parts were visible.  Their color was sodium yellow so they may have actually been white or light grey in color and reflecting light from the sodium vapor lamps illuminating the streets in this area.  And both objects had a slow and rock steady flight not fluttering, rocking, wavering, rotating, or changing speed/direction except as noted earlier. The size of the first one was approximately that of a small dress shirt button held at arm's length the second one appeared to be about half that size. The laser I used has an effective range of only a few thousand feet with this amount of light pollution in the area, so the altitude of the object I actually hit had to be ~3,000 feet or below for me to be able to easily see the spot on it. Both objects traversed about 50° worth of sky (a mile or two if they were at this low an altitude) before disappearing. I attempted to take pictures, but neither object was large or bright enough to show up on my cheap digital camera.  The pictures came out as just digital noise. I watched the meteor storm & the sky intently for approximately another 90 minutes after this sighting, and did not see anything else out of the ordinary. I am a full-time museum curator & product evaluator, I do not use drugs, and I haven't consumed any alcoholic beverages since mid-September.  And I know I wasn't just seeing things.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Luminous round object over Seattle;2004-07-13 00:35:00;30 seconds;Luminous round object over Seattle I live near the top of the East slope of Queen Anne hill in Seattle. At about 12:35 last night, while I was sitting at my computer, which sits in front of a second-story east facing window, I noticed a glowing object in the sky.  It was about 75 degrees from the horizon and moving from North to South.  I turned off my computer monitor, as it was the only light in the room, and stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the object as it passed nearly over my position.  The object was 3 or 4 times the size of a star and glowed dimly but steadily.  Unlike the many planes and helicopters that can be viewed from the sweeping views of my east-facing windows, this object had no blinking lights from any visible angle and made no sound. It did not twinkle, like a star and was far too large to be a satellite.  It was about 1/3 the size of my pinky nail held at arms length.  It did not really emit light, but rather had just a dim luminosity. The roundish shape of the object and its glow appeared the same as it approached my position from the north, passed over and continued on toward the south.  Before passing out of my line of sight to the south, the object made a sweeping curve toward the west appearing to gain elevation during the curve.  As it proceeded west it appeared to descend a bit, then it paused for a second and then continued on toward the west.  This event took about 30 seconds from start to finish.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
I saw a silver ball in the clear blue skies above the Blue Angles flying routine in Seattle on 8/5/2005 at Seafair.;2005-08-05 12:30:00;20 seconds;I saw a silver ball in the clear blue skies above the Blue Angles flying routine in Seattle on 8/5/2005 at Seafair. I was with a large group of people standing on a dock watching the Blue Angels over Lake Washington while they were performing their stunts during Seafare.  I was watching one of the jets flying straight up at a high altitude when I noticed a silver ball north of the Blue Angel jet.  It appeared to be very high in the sky well above normal flight of commercial jets flying on long trips.  I pointed it out to my 16 year son and another man who was standing next to me.  After I watched it a few seconds and pointed it out, it began moving in a NW direction and it only took about 10 seconds to travel out of sight.  The man I was talking to suggested that it was the space shuttle.  No way can we see that from land.  But, this carft was in our our atmosphere for sure.  I know that airplanes are directed to stay away from the Blue Angels while they are practicing their stunts.  I must believe that they are dissallowed in the area even if they were at 20 or 30,000'.  I had my new digital camera in my hand & I took a photo in hopes of capturing it.  However, my lack of experience with the camera and the slow spped failed to catch it.  This happened about 1/2 way through their routine.  It's my hope that others saw this and have reported on it.  I have heard nothing.  I have been a believer for years.  However, I had never had an encounter in the past.  This object moved so fast that it could not have been a baloon or a plane.  I think that if this was a true event, it was probably there to watch what the B. Angels were doing.  There was not a single cloud in the sky.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

silver round object,size of a small van;2006-05-19 18:00:00;30 minutes;silver round object,size of a small van While I was teaching tennis at the Greenlake Community Center from 5:00pm to 8:00pm one of my students pointed out that a obeject was hovering above us and that it was flashing and not making any noises but moving really slow traveling in a southern direction and then it would stop and started going in a eastern direction really really slow then it stoped and started going towards the western direction and then it would stop and started going in back in the north direction and then it would stop again after about 20 minutes I pointed it out to some of the parents that it might be a UFO and we all including the kids tried to rantionalize what it might not be a?..ballon, satelite,helicopter, or plane, but no noises came from the object at all during the whole time we were watching it. After my lessons one of my friends came by to say hi and he is a graduate from the University of Washington who is a skeptic in the UFO area but this was an eye opener so we walk up to my car and the obeject was still in the area but at a very high altitude around 15,000 to 18,000 in front of clouds that were out on this day.  I can get my students to report the sighting if needed from the tennis class as well as my UW friend.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Opalescent , round (40 ft - 12 meters in diameter) flying object spotted in Seattle-Northgate area;2006-08-13 21:18:00;1 minute;Opalescent , round (40 ft - 12 meters in diameter) flying object spotted in Seattle-Northgate area My spouse and I were sitting outside in our yard watching (and waiting for) the meteor shower.  At the same time I was on the phone talking to a friend whom lives in Las Vegas.  During the time we were outside, we spotted the occaisional meteor.  I also saw a satillite.  We were facing North-North East.  From the North an opalescent, round object, approxmiately 40 feet (12 meters)in diameter appeared from the North heading in a Southernly direction.  The sky was cloud free...in consideraton of seeing other aircraft in the sky, I would say it was approxmiately 2000 feet in the air.  At first I thought it was a large helium, party balloon.  After looking at it more closely, I realised it was a round, solid object.  It traveled fairly fast...I would say it was traveling faster than a jet approaching SEATAC. (We live one block from Aurora Avenue (Hwy.99) between a major avenue and a cemetery.)  At the same time I was telling my friend on the phone what I was seeing.  She too was fascinated by what I was telling her and I gave her a play-by-play account while I was looking at the object. I watched it until I could no longer see it in the distance.  I felt frightened and fascinated at the same time.  Also, it had a fuzzy glow about it and no sound seemed to be coming from it.  We were very excited to see it and I wanted it to fly more around my area so I could enjoy the moment more.  Tonight, I am feeling very lucky to have seen such a thing.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Large circular object quickly streaked across sky heading north, lasted couple seconds then lost sight.;2007-05-15 00:15:00;3 seconds;Large circular object quickly streaked across sky heading north, lasted couple seconds then lost sight. Last night, shortly after midnight I witnessed what I can only describe as a UFO. The area I live is in the very northwest corner of Seattle. In the immediate vicinity there are many lights at play fields, schools, and all along the Highway 99 and I-5 corridors. The light pollution is intense, plus add to that the very bright street lights along most of the streets allow for very few stars to be seen, even on the clearest nights. It was mostly clear last night, with some light cloud cover.  It was windy and fairly chaotic with much traffic noise. At approximately 12:15 AM an object traveling northbound in the sky caught my attention very quickly. There was no noise emitted that I could hear over the wind and traffic, but it seemed close enough that it should have given some report. Initially, I was not paying attention, but caught the movement in my peripheral. I generally pay attention to air traffic, which usually goes from the north to south (Sea-Tac), or east/north east to the south west (Renton?). This object was heading what appeared to be directly north, which usually only occurs when a Coast Guard helicopter is flying along the I-5 corridor.  My first thought was it must be a shooting star.. an enormous shooting star. But the light intensity stayed exactly the same and the path it traveled appeared perfectly straight never varying or arching in the slightest. The reason I thought it was a meteor was because the velocity - it traveled very fast. My view of the east sky is limited on the south and north by large trees and houses. The clear area in which the object was visible runs a good length between the trees, I guess maybe twenty to thirty degrees of unbroken sky. It traveled almost the entire length - from when I took notice and raised my head - to the tree on the north end in a couple seconds. I attempted to follow the path beyond the tree to see if it continued but lost sight, perhaps because my contacts were so dry it forced me to blink repeatedly.  The object itself was a bright light, light yellow in color. I thought it was white at first, but I think there was some yellow in it. It was a circle, maybe a bit oval in shape. I wasn't sure if it was my dry contacts, but it appeared to have left a short tail behind it, like a comet. Like previously stated, I could not hear any sounds emitted from the object. The size of the light was much larger than any airplane lights, helicopter light, or shooting star that I have ever witnessed. The entire incident lasted about 3 seconds. I saw no deviation from a straight path heading due north, maybe north and slightly east. It appeared to be descending, although that may have been it traveling away from my position. If I had to venture a guess based on size where it was flying over I would say somewhere over the north end of Lake Washington, maybe farther east.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
On front porch late at night, circular disk with triangle light formation flying overhead;2007-05-26 01:45:00;15-20 seconds;On front porch late at night, circular disk with triangle light formation flying overhead Before going to bed last night, I stepped out to smoke a cigarette close to 2am.  It was a beautiful, clear warm night.  The stars were out in full effect and I was looking up to gaze a bit when I caught glimpse of what I immediately thought to be a UFO flying north directly over my house (1 block east of Lake City Way).  It's very difficult for me to describe it's size because there was nothing for me to compare it to in the air.  I believe it was from 1000-2000 feet away from me, moving slow enough for me to watch it for 15-20 seconds.  It had three circular lights underneath it with smaller lights around the 3 big ones.  The lights where a dim yellow / white hue, they weren't shining down, they were just merely on.  There was nothing at all blocking my view from it, but after 15-20 seconds it simply vanished.  It didn't vanish into the horizon, or disappear behind a cloud, nor did it do any cool star wars tricks, it just faded away in front of my eyes.   I should also note that there was no cars on the road near me, no airplanes or helicopters above me and this thing made ZERO sound whatsoever.  It should have been loud as hell the distance it was from me, so it was very confusing to my senses.  I stood outside for another 20 minutes trying to see if it would come again, and in that course of time I saw 2 shooting stars and a satellite way above earth, so I am 100% positive it was neither of those things.  I have always semi-believed in alien life forms, but maybe it's the kind of thing you will never fully believe until you see it with your own eyes.  I know what I saw.  The moment I saw it I knew I was looking at a UFO.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Saw same thing thake place in Seattle like reported in Arizona 1997 but dooring daylight hours.;2007-08-02 17:00:00;30 Minutes;Saw same thing thake place in Seattle like reported in Arizona 1997 but dooring daylight hours. On thursday afternoon my girlfriend and I after work on a nice blue sunny summer afernoon went for a walk in the park. We found a nice place to lay down in the grass by South Seattle Community Collage. I was laying on my beck lucking up in the sky saw this crome shiny circle thought a lost birthay ballune belonging to a child. Time 5PM I notised it wasent moving the airmass was moving South airplanes were taking off to the north out of Seatac. (It remaining steady) At this point I pointed out the object to my girlfriend next to me and she aknowledged and pointed out an other one next to it. So then I look over counting a total of five of them The first one closest to me must have been at a lover altitude ore it was bigger in sice I dont know. The other four were visible at the same altitude ore size, they were sitting there in a formation stright line with the two last ones forming a arrow tail. The exact location was between seatac and Sattle downtown I'd say right over Beakon hill. Its to difficuld to guess the altitude my guess 5000feet Agl or less then 10000 AGl. At one point they drifted furder north closer to Seattle at a very slow speed perhaps 3 Miles in distance,against the wind ,later they drifted about 4 Miles South East and stayed put once more all this in a spane of aproximatley 30 minutes. I brought this up becouse I whatched your show on cabel obout UFO sighting in Arizona in 1997 .What I saw took place during the bright daylight hours and perhaps not so clear ore easy to spot for meany other peaople . They were not lid up like in Arizona at night. Pilots mast have seen them altought planes landing and thaking off at SEA international airport are at a much lover altidue and probably dont staire stright up in to the sky. Airtraffic controll my have someting on tape. All this took place on Seafair weekend comming up 2007 on a Thursday . After 30 minets or so they vanished in to thin air. I wander If other people saw it too. Good luck find out whats out there for all of us and sorry for my writing skills.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

It was a beautiful sunny day in Seattle on Monday, August 11th 2008.  My friend & I were outside in the pool lounging.  I happened to glance to the north and I saw these 5 white circles (possibly diamond shaped) in the sky. They were hovering fairly high and then started to rotate around each other in a very uniform way.  For a few minutes I watched and asked my friend to verify that she saw these objects as well. She did indeed see the same objects I believe were UFOs. They continued to rotate around each other as I watched. Slowly one headed south, the other four objects kept rotating and sure enough one by one followed the first object south.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Looking  to  the southeast, at my 10:30 position  at  a low altitude, i saw a bright, oval shaped, dark amber u.f.o, at first, i thought it was a helicopter or a flare.  It began to descend and move towards me, i estimate this object was visible for about 2 minuets, It came i estimate about one mile from me at an altitude of about 500 feet, i was making no noise whatsoever, i now observed that this craft had multi-colored lights around the edge. A much smaller craft, about a tenth of the size was then propelled or was fired upwards to the east at a VERY fast velocity,  then, suddenly both of these craft disappeared completely. I would like to know if anyone else saw this event. all i know is that it couldn't have been a meteor, airplane or helicopter, it wouldn't have been a  flare either since the object traveled to the northwest in my direction vertically.

A starng white circle with a black inner circle.;2011-03-22 17:45:00;5 mins;A starng white circle with a black inner circle. On March 22 2011, our family was in Seattle Washington, for the weekend. We were staying at the Best Western Executive Inn.  Our room was opposite side of the space needle. We were on the 3rd floor looking towards the freeway. Around 5pm that evening my husband was taking a nap, myself and my 2 children were looking out the window, watching all the aircrafts descending for landing.  We were also watching the local king 5 news helicopter taking off and landing. We watched the helicopter take off and go up and down the free way, and then land.  I guess it must have been around 5:45pm - 6pm when I was looking out the window and spotted a strange white/silvery ball to the upper right of the window. It looked like it was spinning and then a smaller black circle would appear and disappear, in the middle and to the bottom.  It was strangely odd.  I called my husband over he saw it...we all saw it.  Just then a passenger aircraft passed right under it, a total near miss.  Judging by the size of the passenger jet, it was about the size of a car.  We watched it for about 5 minutes as it moved from the right of the window, to the left, diagonally going upwards, and into the clouds, then out of the atmosphere. I did try to take a picture with my iphone, but it couldn’t pick it up.  I’m certain we have see a UFO. I was just wondering if anyone had reported this.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

The “lights” had circular shape in a yellow/gold color, coming from the Lake Union area, down, from the horizon, going up, and travelling from East to South.  I took some binoculars and it seemed that the yellow/gold circle had a red center.  We are not sure what this was, because it was unlike anything else we have seen before.  If they were fireworks, they should have gone up, faster, but these were travelling in the sky, in pairs, it seems, and there were about 16. It took them about 5-10 minutes to go from one place to the other, and then they vanished.

Multiple bright strobes in a circular pattern over Puget Sound near Mebane Point navigational bouy.;2012-09-08 21:00:00;30 minutes;Multiple bright strobes in a circular pattern over Puget Sound near Mebane Point navigational bouy. September 8, 2012,  Performing a boat delivery five nautical miles north of Shilshole marina Seattle WA.  The time was approximately 2100.  I was traveling southbound at between 5 and 6 knots in a southerly breeze of 12 with a disturbed sea state.  Clear skies very little ambient light. I was distracted by a flashing strobe type light from astern (North) looked back and discounted it as air traffic.  About five minutes later took another look and lights were much closer and well defined.  The strobes were flashing from my right to left (east to west) in the front of the craft.  Continued to monitor the craft as it neared. As the craft passed over head I could determine that the flashes were distinct separate lights moving around the craft.   The lights were bright enough for me completely lose my night vision.  I could not make out any sound (please note that I was running a diesel engine at full throttle in building seas and breeze).  I would approximate the altitude around 2000 to 3000 ft.  Please note that I did not see any navigational lights or spots. The craft continued south, parallel to numerous commercial flights heading north prior to their east bound turn (out of Seatac).  It passed at least three jets heading north and if this was odd they could not have missed the lights.  I tracked the craft as it made an easterly turn over the shipping canal toward Lake Union.  At this point I thought it might have been a strange lighting configuration on a sea plane which would land on lake union.  Or a new lighting configuration on a plane heading for Boeing Field. My curiosity was piqued when the craft did not land in lake union or turn south to Boeing Field but instead turned north (probably over lake Washington) and continued that course until I lost it behind the rise (this is how I approximated the altitude)  I was about two miles off shore and to lose it behind the hill the angle would not allow for much height. Strange occurrence and thought if you got other reports this might help to substantiate them.  Times and heights are all approximated so use with a grain of salt.  But I hit the Shilshole dock at 2200 so speed and time are pretty close.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

My wife and I witnessed 15-20 orb shaped lights heading south and gaining elevation over north Seattle.;2013-02-15 20:15:00;10 minutes;My wife and I witnessed 15-20 orb shaped lights heading south and gaining elevation over north Seattle. UFO sighting 2/15/13 Seattle, WA   At about 8:15 in the evening, my wife stepped outside onto our deck in Seattle to take a closer look at some orb shaped lights that she was watching in the direction of NE.  I saw her outside and asked what she was looking at.  She explained that she wanted to hear what these aircraft sounded like.   I joined her outside on the deck to check it out.  We were unable to hear any sound like jets or helicopters.   We see a lot of aircraft from our house, which overlooks Greenlake as a lot of air traffic comes in from the north when the south wind prevails.  The breeze we had this night was from the north.  The sky was clear for the first time in days and we were able to see a series of orange orb - like lights that seemed to come up from the NE horizon, maintain speed as if it was an aircraft and head south while gaining altitude.  We could see 2 or 3 at a time.  They did not blink or flash like aircraft usually do.   As they got about due east, they would fade out and new ones would appear coming from the same direction.   I ran upstairs, got my little camera and took a few photos and a little bit of video while we watched for approx. 10 minutes.   At one point, we could see a small aircraft with its flashing lights that appeared to be much closer to us than the orbs heading south.  We probably saw 15-20 lights in all. It would be very difficult to tell the distance – but we both figured at least about 5 miles away – but it’s only a guess. After the sighting, I turned on the news, thinking I’d see some explanation, but nothing was reported.  Checked the net first thing this a.m. nothing there. We have a clear view of  Greenlake and the Cascade mountains from our deck , kitchen and upstairs and had even commented earlier in the day how clear the view was. Also, we’ve lived in this house for about 30 years, seen a lot of aircraft – but this was different.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
7-10 bright orange orbs flying past Space Needle Saturday, March 23 10:33pm.;2013-03-23 22:34:00;3 minutes;7-10 bright orange orbs flying past Space Needle Saturday, March 23 10:33pm Saturday, March 23, 2013 at 10:30 pm I was sitting in my car on Queen Anne Hill in Seattle, WA.  I was facing south, with a great view of Downtown and the Space Needle.   At 10:34 I saw 7 or 8 bright orange orbs float upward from left to right seemingly from Capitol Hill or First Hill.  They continued to float/fly up behind the Space Needle heading from east to west. Some seemed to head south, and some seemed to head north before disappearing into the clouds. They appeared to move as fast as a small airplane or helicopter.  Seeing them fly across the sky and disappear into the clouds took about 3 or 4 minutes. 3 or 4 of these orange orbs were brighter than the rest.  They had a soft flickering quality.  They also appeared at first to be in a cluster, and then flew away from each other in a more perpendicular line while flying upwards.  Although the line was by no means perfectly straight. I sent a friend a text to ask if he had seen the bright orange orbs flying past the Space Needle.  He said no. At 10:54 pm another orange orb popped out of the sky over Capitol Hill or First Hill and flew upwards from left to right.  I told my friend to look out his window at, what I called, the loner orb.  He saw it and we watched it for about 5 minutes.  This one flew up west and north.  Finally, another lone orb appeared at 11:39 following the same flight pattern as the orb before it. After that I went home.  I have wondered why there haven’t been more reports of this sighting.  It was a beautiful Saturday night.  I know there must have been people at Kerry Park that night seeing the same thing I saw.  Please report what you saw!;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

It was a bright light inside of an ovoid translucent mist that had defined edges.   The bright orange light was in the center and it pulsated with brightness as the entire shape glided southerly.   At first I thought it was a plane on fire before realizing that it seemed to move along without disruption.   I turned right on 16th or 17th ave to watch this event.  There were a few others at that corner but did not know if they too were observing what I saw.   I called my brother on my cell phone to ask him to look outside to see if he could see it.  He lives on 68th NW and 34ave NW but he could not see anything unusual.   At this time the shape got smaller, appeared to hover for about 30 seconds before changing its course to a more southwesterly direction.   The path was crossing the lower portion of the moon.  Initially the size of this! object was at least 1/4th the size of the moon.   The entire object became smaller as it seemed to go further away.   The light became more and more looking like a bright star until fading out entirely as it ascended above the horizon south westerly from the moon.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Slow and steady moving orange/red circles sighted in lower altitude sky above northeast Seattle;2013-08-07 22:25:00;7 minutes;Slow and steady moving orange/red circles sighted in lower altitude sky above northeast Seattle The objects were glowing orange/red circles.  One witness said that he saw a structure or body attached behind each glowing circle.  All objects moved at about the same height in a west-southwest direction over northeast Seattle, but appeared to turn to the south.   At this point, the glowing red circles disapeared, but one person saw the barely visible structures.  In other words, the glowing orange/red circles almost appeared as huge headlights to an attached vehicle.  They appeared to be 1000-2000 ft. above the land, well below the height of most aircraft.  In addition, their movement didn't appear to be at a high rate of speed, made no noise and was smooth and even in movement.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
6 yellowish glowing orbs in night sky fly strange patterns over Seattle, then perform a synchronized disappearance.;2014-08-28 22:00:00;2 minutes;6 yellowish glowing orbs in night sky fly strange patterns over Seattle, then perform a synchronized disappearance. I came upon 5 gentlemen on first ave in Seattle looking at something, they claimed they were UFOs.  I watched the 5-6 spherical lights move up and down, left and right, into each other (seemingly) or over each other and then separate again.  What was most interesting was the synchronized disappearance.   In a jagged line, they vanished one by one.  The one on the left moved down slightly for less than a second, then disappeared in mid air.  The one just to the right of that one did the same.  And so on and so forth in a pattern until all were gone. This sighting occurred on the border of Belltown and Lower Queen Anne, and these yellow glowing objects appeared to be above upper Queen Anne or past it.  It was quite remarkable. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a skilled observer.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Circular red object paralleling airplane after takeoff from Seatac;2015-04-19 23:10:00;10 seconds;Circular red object paralleling airplane after takeoff from Seatac On April 19th, 2015, I was outside on my deck located in West Seattle (a neighborhood just Southwest ) of the main downtown core of Seattle, WA, with an approx. 240 degree view from N-NW to S-SW with Boeing Field (KBFI ) and Seatac Intl airport ( KSEA ) flight lines in view at all times of the day and night. At approx 11:10 pm PST I witnessed a twin propeller Alaska airlines flight (I know the airplane and carrier from experience and flight paths) depart Seatac Intl. airport and fly due north before making a westward turn towards my location at the above address. When the airplane was almost directly overhead (approx 85-87 degrees), I witnessed what appeared to be a very bright red circular object/orb appear off the right wing of the plane. This bright red object followed the plane before I ran to the sliding door on our deck and called for my girlfriend to come witness this object and as she came outside, the object disappeared but during the time I witnessed the object it paralleled the airplane off the right wing in perfect alignment with the airplane in a westward direction before disappearing. My girlfriend and I were on the deck and as I am showing as well as describing what I saw to her, a very bright streak appeared directly overhead moving West to East in what I approximate to be the very same path the object I initially saw take with the airplane. This streak was very sudden and abrupt and travelling at extreme speed (I did NOT see an object with this streak whatever it was ) but found it to be coincidental considering what I had just witnessed.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Two saucer-shaped objects streak across Seattle sky, captured with camera.;2015-07-02 21:57:00;1 second;Two saucer-shaped objects streak across Seattle sky, captured with camera. On Thursday, July 2nd, at approximately 10pm, I raised my camera to take a picture of the Seattle skyline during a boat trip on Lake Union at dusk, and saw an object streak across my viewfinder from one side of the screen to the other.   Thinking it may have been a reflection of a light that could have provided an interesting visual effect upon the photo, I swiped to the picture immediately to find a still capture of what was in fact two side-by-side saucer shaped lights flying across the city!   They were bright white/blue in color and seemed to have a ring of light around two parts of each saucer.   They appeared to the eye during the initial sighting as a streak going across my view at a very high speed, but the photo shows two clearly defined objects.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Two silent objects moving slowly.  Daylight sighting.;2015-07-31 08:30:00;5 minutes;Two silent objects moving slowly.  Daylight sighting. While eating a snack outside the Safeway store in the University District of Seattle, I saw two objects in the morning sky.  They both had three white lights mounted to them at what would have been the rear of them, given the direction they were moving.  They were headed from NE to SW silently.   I pointed them out to someone in the parking lot and he didn't know what they were, either.   It's difficult to judge the altitude of the crafts they weren't flying particularly low but they also weren't way up in the sky either.  I would guess 2,000-3,000 ft up.   I watched them until one of them disappeared.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Bright white circular light with a long orange tail moving quickly westward across the sky;2015-12-04 18:53:00;2 seconds;Bright white circular light with a long orange tail moving quickly westward across the sky I was standing on the corner of 85th St. NW and 24 Ave. NW, in Seattle, WA, absentmindedly looking north.  I turned my head and caught an extremely bright white circular light with a long orange tail traveling westward across the sky.  I only noticed it after it has halfway across the exposed view of the sky and it quickly traveled out of view. No sound was heard.   About 30 seconds later a helicopter or aircraft followed on a similar path. I've never submitted a UFO report before and would certainly believe if it was a human made object.  I have observed shooting stars before and this was significantly larger and brighter than anything I've ever seen.

Orange light moving over Lake Union at night;2017-05-28 22:30:00;5 seconds;Orange light moving over Lake Union at night At approximately 10:30 PM on 5/28/17, I noticed an orange light over Lake Union.  The light was steady and was moving slowly from north to south.  It seemed somewhat low in the sky from my viewpoint.  I could see the lights on TV towers on Queen Anne Hill that appeared to be at a higher level than this light. I watched the light for about 5 seconds, then went to another room to get my camera. When I returned, the light was gone.  I did not see it again.  I am in an area where planes on approach to SeaTac airport are visible much of the time.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

It started out dim and them got brighter, meanwhile another one appeared next to it and began to get bright as well.  They both became super bright and then the first one started to dim as well as the second one until gone.  They did not move at all.  No sound.  Did anyone else see it?;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I took a photo of it because it seemed odd and out of place as I had never seen this before.  This was red in color like Mars, but is was not where Mars would have been in the night sky on September 6th, and it did not move.   After I took the photo, around 3.5 – 4 minutes later, I returned and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report fails to indicate the date of the event, and provides no contact information.

Stationary Object With Extension Emerging Retracting High Above SeaTac or Boeing Field.;2018-07-14 19:00:00;10+ minutes;Stationary Object With Extension Emerging Retracting High Above SeaTac or Boeing Field. Having just paid, we lined up for the Bainbridge Island ferry in downtown Seattle, on the north side of Colman Dock.  At the time it was 81 degrees F, the skies were clear and blue and visibility was good. After walking to the end of the dock to take photos I returned to the car.  At about 7pm, while watching a jet flying overhead, I noticed (also to the south) a white round or oval object a bit to the west of and much higher up than the jet.  It did not seem to be either taking off or landing so I watched it.  After a few minutes it remained in place so I pointed it out to my husband. He thought its shape was odd (not plane-like).  At first he thought it was moving but after observing it for a minute or so said it was remaining in place. At about 7:05pm we both saw something extend out of it temporarily (for between 15 to 20 seconds).  The extension appeared smaller than and the same color white as the main object and it too was also round or circular.  At 7:05pm I took one photo of the object with my cell phone. After maybe 30 seconds the same object emerged from the main object again.  Again it retracted into the main object.  Thereafter, during the entire time we watched, this happened at the same intervals regularly.  The second object may not have been extending and retracting but only appearing to as perhaps the entire object may have been rotating with something extended from it.  It was too far to tell. After watching for a bit the second object appeared to me to be an arm with something circular at the end of the arm.  My husband saw a round object emerging and returning to the main round object (no arm).  He thought the extension was maybe another (a second) circular object like the main one. At no time did we see anything actually leave the main object.  We agreed as we watched that it was not a plane, conventional drone, kite, blimp, or helicopter (it had no tail, wings, or rotor).  We did not hear any noise from it.  At 7:08 I took a second photo of it with my cell phone. We tried but could not identify it and got back into the car to wait (where it was cooler because of the A/C).  We each looked at the object every so often.  At around 7:10pm my husband said it was slowly fading.  I looked and thought it was maybe drifting south but my husband thought it was slowly ascending.  After a couple of minutes we could no longer find it. Though the line for the Bainbridge Island ferry was about one third full by 7:05pm during the sighting I did not notice anyone else watching it.  There were cars lined up on the south side of the ferry terminal heading to Bremerton but I could not see them so I do not know if anyone there saw it. Based on its relative position: to us where we were on Colman Dock and to the various jets we saw take off, it appeared to have been over Boeing Field or SeaTac Airport, but was at a much higher elevation than the jets taking off.  As it was far above us, there was no way to estimate its size. Neither of us ever did identify it. Of the two photos I took, neither is a good photo but after zooming in fully, the object is visible in each photo.  In the 7:05pm photo it is a white diamond shape with rounded diamond points.   In the 7:08pm photo it is smaller than it is in the first photo, and not a diamond but a blurry conical shape.  No extension is visible in either photo.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

A few nights ago I noticed when I went out on my deck a very bright light which resembled a star from the N side.  ((Venus??));2020-04-17 22:35:00;30;A few nights ago I noticed when I went out on my deck a very bright light which resembled a star from the Northwest side. It was a clear day & night so I figured it was just an extremely bright star.  I watched it for over an hour which it was slowly going down until I could no longer see it behind the building next to us.  I even showed my husband. Well, it’s back tonight right now.  Same place, we’ve been watching it for about 10 minutes now, I decided to take a vid, you can see a plane pass by with blinking lights, the vid is a bit blurry since the thing is so bright.  But you can see it doesn’t move & the plane does. I could be completely wrong & it could be a very bright star...I wish you all could see what we see instead of the vid, I have an iPhone XR I took the recording of. It’s still there if anyone reads this & wants to take a closer look maybe with a telescope which we don’t have.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
