Ball with short cone trailing it, high above horizon (almost overhead when first see), traveling from NW to SE, covered an arc of maybe 12+ degrees, starting from maybe 25 degrees from directly overhead and ending about 40 degrees from overhead.  It was red and green - I think the ball was red and the cone behind it green, but it might have been the reverse - I was too astounded and it was too brief and unexpected for me to be sure.  The length of the cone (tail) was probably twice the diameter of the ball.  The whole thing - ball and cone - was about 2/3 the size of the moon.  The ball was about 20% the size of the moon.  There was no sound. It curved slightly downward toward the SE and suddenly disappeared.  Did not fade out - just disappeared as if someone turned off a switch.  It looked like a Christmas tree light going across the sky.  I assume it was a meteor.  I've never seen anything like it before.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
