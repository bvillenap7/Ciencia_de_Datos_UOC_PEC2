Th;1997-11-14 21:00:00;5-8 seconds;Summary : Siting at stop light on Alaskan Way, heading west.  Streaks of lights came flying across the sky, coming from over the Puget Sound.  They were flying in a straight, direct path heading northerly.  Bright white lights, long tails of light that appeared to dissipate and then return almost as if there were streaks of smoke or haze along with the lights.  Seemed to be three or four large ones and several small ones all flying in the same pattern.  Didn't appear to be a meteor shower as the flight path was not headed in a downward gravitational manner.  Shape was difficult to distinguish.  Most distinguished features were the tails as the lights would disappear and then return.

V-Formation over West Seattle;2001-11-07 20:30:00;20-30 seconds;V-Formation over West Seattle It was approximately 8:30 PM in the Alaska Junction area of West Seattle. I was home, just looking out the window at the northwest section of the night sky, when a large v-shaped formation of 7 round white lights came into view, slowly moving south.  The formation seemed to be at the same altitude commercial jets use when they fly. It definitely got my attention, since I didn't think any pilots (military or civilian) would be flying at night in close formation like the Blue Angels.  The v-formation appeared almost vertical, poised to gain altitude quickly.  Each of the round lights seemed larger than regular aircraft lights, looking more like spotlights instead.  Also, even though the lights were bright, I couldn't see any outline of a craft. To my complete amazement, the whole v-formation appeared to come to a complete stop, and then all 7 lights started blinking and moving irraticly in and out of formation.  This went on for almost 10 seconds. Amazed by what I was seeing, I jumped up to get a better look, but just as I did so, the lights went back into v-formation and flew over my house, continuing south. I quickly ran to look out a window on the south side of the house to see it emerge, but there was nothing there.  It seemed as if the whole v-formation just disappeared, or went straight up into space.  Very strange, very ufo.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

He quickly looked up, and was flabbergasted to witness two distinctly red, seemingly oblong luminous objects moving across the sky at a high angular velocity.  He reported that they were very bizarre in appearance, and they may have maneuvered, relative to each other.  They disappeared behind a nearby building, as they coursed generally to the northwest.  The witness quickly returned to his residence and drew a picture of what he had just witnessed minutes earlier.  NUFORC is awaiting a written report from the witness.

Two amber lights were seen snaking from the southwestern sky to the northwestern sky.;2007-04-30 21:30:00;5 seconds;Two amber lights were seen snaking from the southwestern sky to the northwestern sky. Two amber lights were seen moving from the southwestern sky to the northwestern sky.  The two lights moved together in a wave-like fashion, much like a sine wave with a low amplitude, like flying fish or flying snakes.  There was an airplane in the sky and the two crafts were moving about 10 times faster than the airplane, and were at a comparable altitude to the moving plane.   It was clearly a two craft formation as the crafts moved independently, but in the same way, so they were clearly flying in formation and rather close to each other.  As it was dark, all I could see were the steady amber lights of the crafts.  The crafts moved across much of the high-altitude skyline and and appeared over the southwestern skyline and disappeared above the northwestern skyline.  If I was the center of a circle, and the path I was viewing is thought of as an arc of a circle with me at the center, the crafts moved in an arc of about 120-150 degrees.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Bright object falling from sky towards Seattle airport 10/26/07;2007-10-26 18:55:00;3-5 seconds;Bright object falling from sky towards Seattle airport 10/26/07 My friend and I are both Technical Designers at Boeing.  We were driving to a movie, heading south on I-5.  The night was very dark and very clear.   Suddenly a shape plunged diagonally across the sky, heading towards the SeaTac airport.  It was shaped like a series of three bubbles overlapping each other slightly.   I saw a faint red hue along the top, my friend saw a faint green hue along the bottom.  It did not appear to be anything organic.   There has been no report of a meteor or fireball in any media we have seen.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Formation activity over Seattle, persistant strange lights.;2009-03-20 21:00:00;2 hours;Formation activity over Seattle, persistant strange lights. On the night of March 20, 2009 in Seattle, Washington I sat with my husband smoking a cigarette on our porch looking up at the sky. I noticed a bright light moving fairly quick, flying much higher than an airplane. I told my husband to take a look at it and he mentioned that it was probably a satellite, although it was much too low and moving much too fast to be a satellite. We watched it move east, and my husband then decided it was a high flying airplane, but then we noticed it move in front of a low altitude cloud. Meanwhile a descending airplane flew south above us and when the strange light intersected the path of the airplane it stopped and then quickly shot off to the west. When we came back out an hour later, the temperature had dropped significantly and I had become nauseous and my husband began to shake. We noticed that there was a lot of movement up above, lights flying past quickly, as well as several much brighter shifting lights in triangular formations. There were multiple sets of these formations. These were not stars because the lights that seemed to be hovering were not covered by passing clouds. My husband describes witnessing several lights emitting other, lesser lights. They did this in such a way that it seemed they were arching out of the bright light in symmetry. This seemed to be happening around, inside, and above faint clouds. We both thought these clouds were strange. The clouds seemed teaming with activity. Some lights just hovered in one spot, some would rock back and forth, other would rise softly and drop dramatically, sweeping away into the horizon, much like the very first light we saw. All these lights moved gracefully and moved at incredibly fast rates. We also noticed that some of these lights seemed to shake softly, in the way a pen would move across paper while writing. We kept watching this, and the activity never seemed to let up. We became colder and more nauseated and had to go back inside. Once inside, we felt drained of our energy and fell asleep quickly in all our clothes, and slept uninterrupted for the next 10 hours.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Seattle strange star-like objects;2010-08-14 20:48:00;3 minutes;Seattle strange star-like objects Seen from Seattle looking to the southwest.  We saw 3 star-like objects moving slowing together in a triangle formation heading east-southeast.  Each moving star (3-4 inches apart from one another by hand measurement) slowly disappeared one at a time. It appeared that each of the 3 star-like objects were moving together in the same exact direction and were paralleling each other on their route. We thought it could have been 3 satellites moving together but very strange they were in a triangle formation and moving at relatively the same velocity.  They disappeared at different times, (disappearing 3-5sec. apart from one another).  Just thought someone should know.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
V-Shaped Formation of Objects Over Seattle;2011-04-30 23:40:00;30 seconds;V-Shaped Formation of Objects Over Seattle I'm a 43 year old graphic artist, and will email you my Photoshop interpretation of the sighting.  Please note that this is NOT a real photo but was drawn immediately after the sighting while my memory was very fresh. At 11:40pm I stepped out on my rooftop deck for a breath of air and to take in the view before bed. The deck faces south and offers a panoramic view of Seattle.  As I am located about a half mile from downtown, the glow of the city lights gave a subtle pinkish hue to the few scattered clouds in the sky.  There was no moon or wind of any kind, nor any sound except the faint drone of city traffic.    As my gaze drifted to the 40 degree Southwestern area of the sky I suddenly noticed a v-shaped squadron of about 8-10 pale whitish objects rapidly emerge from behind a cloud.  They were flying toward the Northeast at a very high rate of speed for their apparent very high altitude.  They caught my attention due to the oddly pale appearance, great speed and lack of any marking lights or sound.  It was hard to tell whether they were self-illuminated or merely reflecting the glow of the city lights as they were so pale.  The squadron was about the size of my index and middle fingers held at arm's length, from the tips to the knuckle.  The point of the V was at the prevailing tip of the formation. After about 10 seconds it reached the 90 degree position, so I turned to continue watching.  At this point I noticed that there were two additional objects of the same color, size and brightness off to the right of the formation.  These two objects were very close together and kept a perfect pace with the main v, and were the distance of roughly five squadrons away.  At about 140 degrees northeast the objects became obscured by a cloud and I lost track of them as they were already getting very far away anyhow.  The time from the start of the sighting until the end was about 30 seconds. The flight path was perfectly straight and unwavering.  At no time did any of the objects deviate in position at all from the others, which indicated that possibly this could have been one gigantic triangle rather than separate objects.   At the exact moment that the formation disappeared, a passenger jet and small private plane came into view lower in the same section of the sky.  It was instantly obvious that the formation wasn't conventional aircraft because the jet and plane had all the usual lights and obvious sounds coming from them, and they were far brighter and more yellowish in color than the pale and dim white hue of the formation.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

They would move formation to real close almost looked like a constellation of a star, then would get really close, and move back.    Couldn't make sense of how it was possible with physics known by aircraft here.   Then one by one they vanished.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

At 22:50 PST, on Sunday, April 20th, I stepped out onto my porch, and almost immediately, I saw two lights in very close formation moving from south to north in a straight line.   They were moving far faster than any aircraft, and there was no sound whatsoever.  I was only able to see them for approximately 5 seconds before they were gone.  I estimate the altitude to be only a few thousand feet. I see aircraft lining up for arrival at SeaTac airport every day and I am absolutely certain this was not an aircraft.   This was also far too low to be a satellite.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

3 lights chilling (like ordinary stars)-suddenly break apart and move in opposite directions.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-22 03:45:00;50 minutes;Three lights chilling (like ordinary stars) - suddenly break apart and move in opposite directions - one comes back thru Sitting in back yard with my lady on my lap, watching sky for aerial phenomena, as we both enjoy doing, 3:45am. All-at-once, same time, this slightly askew triangle (just looks like ordinary stars), broke apart in opposite directions--Two lights slow moving while the third light moved away much, much faster (south). Those two slow moving lights came to rest after about 12 seconds (appearing tethered like two a moored boats), remaining the same distance from each other, swaying slightly, about four fingers apart. The third light in the formation that moved much-much faster, was quickly out of our view because of the house/roof (like 3 seconds). So we watched the two tethered lights for about 8 minutes.  Then another light came back from the same direction as the fast moving third one, like it had done a u-turn, flew right back at the same speed.  It went right between the two tethered lights, and kept going until out of sight (north). We watched those two steady tethered lights until they started to fade with the sunrise and we went inside, at least another 40 minutes til we turned in. Unique, to say the least.

Six fast white spheres appear briefly in the night sky flying north to south;2018-09-06 01:20:00;3 seconds;Six fast white spheres appear briefly in the night sky flying north to south. Last night I was skywatching with binoculars in the hopes of seeing anomalous craft.  This is an activity that I do along withy my brother with some frequency in the summer.  In the last few weeks we've seen some strange fireballs and flashes that couldn't be accounted for by known aircraft or satellites. My process with the binoculars is to watch one area of the sky for a few minutes, then move to another area and wait.  I often can see satellites not visible to the naked eye this way, and I can track them across the sky easily with the binoculars.  I am an experienced skywatcher and can distinguish most aircraft, satellites, and meteors. I was looking towards the west and a series of objects entered the frame of the binoculars from the north.  It consisted of six white spheres arranged in a straight line, but the line itself was oriented maybe 15 degrees to the right of the direction of travel.  A good analogy is if you took a v-shaped flock of flying geese and removed half the geese. I immediately started tracking the objects across the sky until they reached the horizon to the south.  The binoculars I was using were 7x zoom, and the full width of the formation filled roughly one third of the view area of the binoculars.  The formation was very fast, from the moment I began tracking it to the moment it was beyond the horizon was less than three seconds.  The spheres themselves were several times larger than a commercial airliner appears in the binoculars at cruising altitude (30,000 feet).  The objects themselves appeared to be quite high, but judging by their size it seems unlikely they were in space. The objects themselves are difficult to describe because of their speed.  They obviously were lit, but only dimly.  It almost appeared if they were a projection, perhaps semi-transparent.  They somewhat reminded me of seeing spotlights projected onto clouds when I was a child, but the sky was clear and there was nothing to project onto.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
