Dark rectangle moved slowly across sky with swaying motion, possible telepathy with 2nd observer;1981-06-15 22:30:00;2 - 3 minutes;Dark rectangle moved slowly across sky with swaying motion, possible telepathy with 2nd observer Walking down an alleyway between two-story warehouses with a friend, had an urge to stop and  look directly above me. As I looked up an object slowly floated into view. It was rectangular, dark and moving VERY slowly.  I thought at first it must be a plane but could see no blinking lights or light of any kind, then of course nothing where a fuselage would be, and what would be wings weren't swept back and were squared off and not tapered like wings. There was no sound. It was only visible because of the city light vaguely illuminating it's underside.  My friend had continued on several yards still talking to me, noticed that I had stopped and was looking up at something. So he looked up to see what i was looking at. By the time he saw the thing it had moved about a third of the way across the piece of sky that we could see.  I was starting to notice all kinds of unusual detail on the thing, like rods protruding and lines underneath. And there was really something strange about the way it was moving. And another REALLY odd thing was... I seemed to be able to hear the thoughts in my friends head. It seemed that once he noticed the strange motion, that it seemed to move a liitle and then stop, move and stop, like it was swaying, but not side to side but up and down, I thought I heard him think to himself Is it a Bird? Then I said out loud to his unvoiced question No, it's not a bird  We stood there transfixed, watching as it moved out of view behind a building. I ran to the end of the alley to try and spot it again but there was a bright street light in my eyes. My friend stood there transfixed, he said more because of me reading his mind than what we had seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Boomerang shaped metalic craft over the pugit sound;1996-07-24 16:00:00;45 minutes;Boomerang shaped metalic craft over the pugit sound At this point i cant really remember what year or day it was exactly but it was about 8 years ago  when this happened.I had just got off work and went down to pioneer squar in down town seattle.I was headed to a freinds birthday party,where he lived in the penthouse on top of some building down there. I had gone out on the terace and opened my first beer,and it was nice and warm out because it was in the middle of the summer.It was a really nice day, and not a cloud in the sky.eventually after being out there for about 5 to 10 minutes i notices something kinda hovering out over the water.It was moving from north to south really slow,and at first i didnt give it much thought because initially i thought it was a hang glider.I was talking to someone and i kept looking over at the object, and eventually it just stoped and hovered. So i started to ask others at the party what the hell is that.the owner of the place actually brought out some binoculars and we got a really good look at this thing.   It was actually to big to be a hang glider, and the only reason i thought thats what it was at the begining was because it was boomerang shaped.It had a very shiney metalic almost chrome look to it,and while it was hovering in the same spot it was fliping from front to back, and from side to side.While this was happening i was looking at it through the binaculars, and in the middle of the craft the metal was warping and changeing shapes.There were geometrical patterns forming and creases in the metal itself and they were changing.Imagine how the cuts on a daimond looks and while you are looking at them they are shifting and makeing new side apear.Thats what it was like.  My freinds and I then watched this craft rise slowly out of the atmosphere, or at least straight up till it disapeared, and the whole time it kept fliping and turning from one side to another while warping its own configuration.I would really say that there were about 15 to 30 people there who all saw this happen, and i got to say its one of the strangest crafts ive ever seen.I grew up near numerouse military instilations and have been on many military bases,and have even been on a veriety of militaray airplains,ships,tanks.You name it ive seen it first hand, so im used to seeing all kinds of things like that but ive never seen anything like this.  Now im not claiming that this thing was something from another world or an alien craft or even a military craft.Frankly i dont know what kind of craft it was.What i do know, was that this had some type of intelegant behaivior about it,and i also know it wasnt a baloon or something simple like that.It was pretty complex what ever it was.I found it strange that the entire city didnt seem to see this craft,because it was pretty big and it was in the middle of broad daylight.I didnt hear anything about it in the news.I am not in touch with the people who saw this with me but if i need to get a hold of them to back up my story i could.Frankly i do not care weather people believe i saw something wierd or not,But just in case someone else saw this there will at least be one report on this incadent.I figured that i should report this since it actually happened, and people can take my word for what it is.Sorry i have no picture or video of the incedent,i never even thought to get a camera out the entire time.I was just to into looking at it, because i was facinated by it.  I would like to add that i do not do drugs nor am i an alcoholic,nor do i have any mental disabilities.  This all lasted for about 45 minutes.

Large visible object on moon;1998-08-14 22:00:00;5+ hours (overnight?);Large visible object on moon We were looking at the moon with a medium -powered telescope when we noticed a large black object that appeared to be stationed on the surface. It was not like the monilith of 2001 but was more the size of a large N.Y.C. skyscraper. It had no features, but was quite obviously not a shadow of a crator and looked very unnatural. There were no reflections on it's surface. As the moon made it's way across the sky we checked to see if the object changed position. It did not- it was still on the moon and in the same place(we noted the position based on craters). My two witnesses were as unable as I to explain what we had seen. The next day, it was not there.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
My wife and I had just left the Hub at the University of Washington where we had attended a graduation ceremony for the Department of E;2001-06-09 11:15:00;approx 30 seconds;My wife and I had just left the Hub at the University of Washington where we had attended a graduation ceremony for the Department of Education. We were walking toward our car which was in parking lot N4.  As we neared Balmer Hall I happened to look up to watch aircraft coming from the northeast on their approach toward Seatac. Planes have always fascinated me and was a Private Pilot for a number of years. When I looked up I noticed a stationary, apparantly rectangular, black object in the sky directly over the north east end of the UW campus which seemed to be at an altitude considerably above the approaching aircraft.  I called to my wife, who immediately looked up and observed the same object.  At first we thought it might possibly be a large bird.  We dismissed that idea since it wasn't moving, didn't have the shape of a bird and appeared to be way too large for its apparant distance from us. We also considered that perhaps something had fallen off an approaching aircraft. Once again we ruled that out since the object seemed to be above the approaching aircraft.  After 15 to 20 seconds the object began to move very smoothly at a very high rate of speed in a Northeast direction directly opposite the path of the approaching aircraft.  At approximately 30 seconds from the time we first observed the object we lost it from sight behind some trees. We discussed the sighting all the way home and have concluded it did not fall into any of the usual bird/aircraft sightings in our experience. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length over the telephone.  The husband is a former military officer, who considers himself to be quite capable of being able to identify aircraft.  He is insistent that the object they witnessed from the University of Washington campus on this graduation day was not any kind of aircraft that he is familiar with.

A large rectangular shadow;2002-04-01 15:00:00;one minute;A large rectangular shadow I was driving on a busy street and stopped at a stoplight. I looked up because the sky was starting to clear and it had been a rainy day. There was a large cloud overhead and I could see a shadow of an aircraft deep inside. I was watching it just thinking it was an airplane but as it got closer to the surface it was a perfect rectangular shadow and way larger than a jet would be. It had no wings and I could see the outline clearly. I was filled with a sense of foreboding but hoped as it came out of the cloud it would be something recognizable. As it came out of the cloud, it was still a rectangular shadow! It did not make sense to see a shadow on blue sky but I have no other description. It made no sound. It made me very afraid and then I realized there was a line of cars waiting for me to move and I had to look away. This shadow object was very scary and I almost started crying. I have no explanation for such a reaction. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from same witness.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Dark rectangle, almost a cube no lights, no sound, no wings, no reflective surface, seen in daylight;2002-10-15 07:30:00;2 minutes;Dark rectangle, almost a cube no lights, no sound, no wings, no reflective surface, seen in daylight It was 7:30AM, sunny, no clouds.  I looked up because the sun glinted off an airplane very very high in the sky.  Below it I noticed a very dark, but not totally black, object moving southwest slowly in a straight line. It looked small - because of the altitude, I suppose, though I had no context to determine its true size or altitude.  Holding my arm straight out and up I'd say it appeared 1/4 the size of the nail on my little finger.  It was a dark rectangle, almost a cube.  It appeared to tumble slowly once in a while because sometimes I could catch a glimpse of blue sky as if it were not just a cube, but a very thick U shape.  Hm, that sounds weird.  Maybe it would be better to say that the solid shape had a bite out of the edge and I could see the blue sky through it when it presented that face to me.  It did not reflect light, it had no wings, there were no lights on it, and I couldn't hear it.  There was no trail.  It was high off the horizon and traversed maybe 50 degrees it was never near the horizon.  When I first noticed it, it was maybe over Lake Forest Park or Lake Washington.  I was looking north.  I watched it until it got to a bit south of NE 104th St where I was standing on 15th Ave NE, but farther west.  Then it appeared to stop, though it could have been going due west and only appeared to stop since I was looking west by then.  Then after 15 seconds or so, it very slowly, slower than it had gone southwest, started going north, though it may have only looked like it was going so slow if it were actually going northwest.  It was slowly getting smaller.  At that point the bus came and I stopped watching. I thought it might be a weather balloon (not that I've ever seen one) but the shape was not round and unless there were upper altitude winds blowing straight southwest, the line of travel didn't seem consistent with a balloon drifting around.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  P.S. I am not a UFO enthusiast.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
'burning paper';2004-02-16 22:05:00;1 minute;'burning paper' I was out on my north facing 3rd floor deck of my apartment on Capitol Hill in Seattle.  I saw what looked like a burning sheet of paper rising and traveling north by north east and rising.  It glowed orange about the same brightness and colour as a cigarette.  It seemed to be moving away quicker than could be explained by wind currents but I cannot estimate it's distance since I don't know it's size and it was above the level of any landmarks when first spoted, I thought at first it was some paper burning, but it didn't go out, it moved away.  I suppose it is possible that that is what it was, and that its apparent motion was caused by it reducing in size and going out but it did not look like that.  a commercial aircraft came about 1 minute later traveling the usual take off route from seatac moving north and then turning east while over Queen Anne & Capitol Hill and moving directly over my apartment.  Unfortunately I spent too long gawking and did not get a photo.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

As;2006-07-16 05:20:00;5:15;I first noticed the object 3/4 of a mile north of my location, at which point what seemed to look like a vertical floating monolith. As the object came closer, never asending nor decending and keeping its pace of what would be considered a casual stroll, the appearance became more detailed. It was about 50 feet overhead, traveling above the the telephone lines that run paralel with my street when I had a better view. It made no sound, infact I experienced silence, not even any sounds of the chirps and bird songs usually heard in my neighborhood on normal occasions. The object was rectangular with rounded edges. It seemed like various cubes stacked on one another with rounded edges forming a long rectangle. The size seemed to be aprox. 10-12 ft. tall x 5-6 ft. wide. Its exterior was clear opaque with a tinge of color like natural sinew. Inside the object a liquid looking substance that was blood red in color seemed to be circulating within, but only circulating within the object through its center keeping aprox. 2 ft. parameter within. The texture appeared to be like a latex form. The bottom of the object formed 4 bulbous cubes where the red substance seemed to be in four different sections. I stood in amazement and watched it travel in the southern direction. Overall, the time duration from when I first noticed the object till it traveled into the horizon was about 1/2 an hour. As the object traveled into the horizon it  appeared to have an aura. I've seen many unusual objects in my life but this was by far the most unusual thing I've ever witnessed, it was beautiful! My occupation is in the preventative health field. I see unusual objects in the sky from time to time and it has been a while.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Shaning and static object in Elliot Bay disappeared in fractions of seconds.;2007-07-26 18:00:00;10 sec;Shaning and static object in Elliot Bay disappeared in fractions of seconds. Sorry for my english.  I was with some friends crossing Elliot Bay on top of a Ferry boat (the one for tourists), and a silver shining object in the sky called my attention. It was static, rectangular and inclined around 45degrees.  It call my attention because there were some aircrafts around, and this rectangular objet was just static in front of my eyes and suddenly disappeared, instantaneusly. It visualization took around 10 seconds.  Sadly nobody else saw it, because they were looking in the opposite way (To the city). I dont know what this thing was, but was nothing that I saw before.  I would like to know if somebody else reported something similar from this area. Thanks.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Then I thought maybe it was an advertising sign of some sort that was flying behind a plane, but there were  no planes around and the way this thing moved was WIERD. Then it just lowered itself down behind the trees. I couldn't see it after that and unfortunately I had to take my exit.  I don't know what the thing was or if anyone else saw it, I hope someone did and will also report it so that I know I am not crazy.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Rectangular Wing sited over Seattle Washington,  on July 18, 2013.;2013-07-18 22:45:00;5 seconds;Rectangular Wing sited over Seattle Washington,  on July 18, 2013. Location:  northeast Seattle, Washington  Time:  22:45 hours  Direction:  observer facing east  Angle of Elevation:  45 degrees  Size of Object:  approximately 6 times larger than full Moon, or 3 inches in diameter as measured between 2 fingers. Direction Object was moving: to the observer's right, southeast. Number of Objects: 1 Color: unlit   On July 18, 2013, in northeast Seattle, Washington, at 10:45 P.M., I observed an unlit rectangular wing flying over my condo.   At first I thought it was a meteor due to its very high speed.   The rectangle travelled in a southeast direction, disappearing over tree tops in approximately five seconds.  The rectangle was very large given its elevation, measuring approximately 3 inches.  Later that evening a Boeing 747 Dreamlifter flew across the same space.  Its elevation was much lower than the rectangle.  I measured the 747 at one-half inch, the diameter of the Moon.  The rectangle covered the same distance as the 747 in a fraction of the time as the latter. I could not detect any sound from the rectangle.  Even though unlit it was observable against the clear night sky, possibly reflecting city lights off its bottom surface.   I believe the rectangle was flying at least 3 times higher from me than the 747.  Given the estimated lengths of each, the rectangle at that elevation would have ! been about 18 times larger than the 747, at 235 feet in length.

Two strange rectangular objects over U District Seattle (possibly only a camera flash reflection off window);2017-01-14 14:00:00;not sure;Two strange rectangular objects over U District Seattle (possibly only a camera flash reflection off window) I’m only reporting this to get some confirmation that this is just camera/window issue and not something of concern.  I did not see these objects.  I’m guessing this may only be a reflection caught by a digital camera when I was taking a picture in the U District Seattle facing east from my bedroom.  I do not think or remember the camera flash going off.  However, I have taken other photos from my windows and never have seen anything like this or seen any type of reflection.  And, it does not look like it’s off the window.  It looks like it’s above the U District area.  This is not photo shopped I don’t know how to use photo shop applications.  I was taking some pictures to show on Facebook to friends of the beautiful day we were having in Seattle on Saturday, 01/14/17.  This was around 1330 to 1430 hours.  The pic says 1620 hours, but the time is incorrect you can see it is early afternoon.  Maybe the correct time is 1420 hours.  I made a short video prior to this photo of about 10 seconds and did not see this in it.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
