Th;1999-01-05 05:36:00;3 seconds;The object was approximatly equal in size to 1/4 full moon.  It was travelling from NW to SE approximately 500 feet over Lake Union. The Space needle was visible above and behind the object. I was driving south on Interstate 5 near the center of the Ship Canal bridge. I was travelling at 60 mph and the object was travelling at approximately 75 mph. Its trajectory was at a slightly downward angle and I got the immpression it would soon strike the roadway some distance ahead. It disapeared instantaneously. The object was forest green in color and teardrop with a long tail. it was lighter in the center. The answer to all the following questions is no.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
An eliptical-teardrop shaped object travelling approx.15-20 degrees above the horizon, from SE to NW in a horizontal position  along Se;1999-10-03 21:45:00;10 secs.;An eliptical-teardrop shaped object travelling approx.15-20 degrees above the horizon, from SE to NW in a horizontal position  along Seola Beach was observed for approx. 10 secs. at 21:45 Sunday, Oct. 3, 1999. My home is located on a cliff overlooking Puget Sound.  It faces south and looks across to Vashon Is.  My living room is floor to ceiling glass, so the object that moved  horizontally across the sky seemed to be following the coastline.  It was extremely large and green-yellow the object seemed to be outlined with a glowing yellow.  Yellow, glowing particles were coming out of the tail.  It moved steadily past my windows but  not with such speed that I was not able to observe it.  The object was as large  or larger than a city bus, eliptical with a long tail.  I might add that this is my first experience seeing something  that cannot be explained, so perhaps it falls into the UFO category. I have lived at this location for many years and am well acquainted with th area.  I am a graduate of the Univ. of Wa. and a retired teacher.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Initially a comet in appearance, but speed was too slow.;2002-10-01 05:42:00;3 seconds;Initially a comet in appearance, but speed was too slow. Object initially appeared to be a meteor. However, the overall speed was modest (to be as close to the earth as it was) and it appeared very, very close. I was traveling by car north on I-5 near Tukwilla (Kent), Washington. The object appeared directly ahead and above in my windshield and then traveled right descending down at a 60 degree angle. Because the interstate is elevated (and the Kent valley is below road level), this object actually appeared to impact below my line of sight within the Kent valley. In fact, it appeared so close I thought that if I could stop and park, I could walk to it. The color of the object was soft yellow with green highlights. It had a trailing tail classic to photo images of comets. However, in seeing meteors from a long distance in the past, this object's speed was well below that of an incoming meteor when observed from far away.  (Perhaps no more than 200-300 mph.) ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor.  Many other reports.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Fast moving blue tear drop shape;2005-07-09 13:00:00;3 seconds;Fast moving blue tear drop shape This is more of a confirmation of http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44892.html  I was at Ronald Bog, in Shoreline, playing frisbee with a friend.  My friend was facing east, threw the frisbee, it went over my head, luckily I turned around to face east to get the frisbee so we both saw it.  Towards northeast,  i saw a tear drop shaped object moving from maybe 40-35 degrees(horizon being 0, straight up being 90).  It looked like it was shooting to Earth, and seemed to snuff out, not going behind the clouds.  It was blue turning into a green aura, moving faster than something at that altitude should have been.  I picked up the frisbee. turned around,  and I could tell by his puzzled look, my friend saw the same thing.  We talked about it and both tried to rationalize it as a firework, given the time of year, but dismissed that idea as there was no bang and it was full and complete on the way down, rather than reaching an apex and fizzling out as fireworks do.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Very large yellow teardrop-shaped disk or meteor dropping several or many miles East of Seattle, Washington - watched for 12-14 seconds;2006-10-01 20:34:00;12 seconds;Very large yellow teardrop-shaped disk or meteor dropping several or many miles East of Seattle, Washington - watched for 12-14 seconds Date:  10 October 2006  Time: 20:34 on 24-Hour Clock (8:34 or 8:32 P.M.  P.D.T.).  Object: Possibly a Meteor coming down to Earth, teardrop shaped (round with short pointed tail).  Coloration: very bright yellow (with duller yellow blotches).  Size: nearly the size of the Moon (which was in the Southern sky), possibly 3/4 to the size of a full Moon.  Azimuth: Using North as zero (0°), to South (180°), and therefore East (90°), the object was at first spotted at nearly 100° and by the time it disappeared over the horizon, it was perhaps 95° azimuth (Left to Right, it was just slightly more to our Right from straight ahead).  Angle of Elevation: closer to 35° than 30 when first spotted, and dropping to about 25° or 20° behind the horizon.  Duration: It was a couple of seconds before I discounted it as not being a reflected glare, and then close to 12 seconds of active watching (while driving, as there was no place to pull over and it was easy to watch while driving as it was so low now and just right of straight ahead). The distance was impossible to tell, but it had the illusion of dropping out toward North Bend or Lake Sammamish.  After: As it disappeared from sight, I called a friend who lives on the West shore of Lake Sammamish to see if they were ok, and to see if they had seen it.  They had there back to the east deck window and had seen it get very bright and then turned to see it glowing over the East horizon.  As they went outside, they heard neighbors talking on their docks asking each other, What the heck was that?  Reporting: I called information for ideas of who to report this to ... I left a message at a Meteor organization in Kent, and then called and left a message at the University of Washington Astronomy Department in Seattle, and then called and spoke with Jennifer at KIRO Radio (710AM) in Seattle, who suggested I also report the event to the folks here at UFOCenter.com (and thank you for your kind call!) even if it was a meteor or such, as it had not yet been identified as such.  POV: My point of view was driving Easterly on the Evergreen Bridge (Hwy 520) from Seattle, Washington toward Lake Sammamish just East of the center of the bridge when I noticed one very large yellow circular shape appearing to drop from the sky slightly to the East-Southeast side of the bridge, but still almost as high as the moon which was in the Southern sky.  I moved my head around a bit to be sure it was not simply a glare on the windshield, but it kept its path in spite of my dramatic movements. My passenger was also astonished at what we were seeing as it was so large and not shooting across the sky as stars sometimes do (my passenger is an adult female, about my age).  Personal Info:  My name is Tim Oldfield, I'm 51 years of age ... back in college to work toward my Masters Degree ... just got my eyes checked at the optometrist 3 weeks ago and they are fine and unchanged (and I have fresh contacts on).   My email is TimO@WayneResearch.com and my mobile phone number is 505 650 0223 (New Mexico number, but I live back in the Seattle area). Too bad cellular phone cameras give such poor results and are so slow to access ... too late.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Photographed UFO over Puget Sound on July 16, 2007 just after sunset.;2007-07-16 22:00:00;1 second;Photographed UFO over Puget Sound on July 16, 2007 just after sunset. I was photographing the western horizon from Alki Beach just after sunset on July 16, 2007. I captured an object over Puget Sound in one of the photographs that was teardrop shaped.  The object may have left a vapor trail. It is hard to tell if a formation is part of the cloud formation or a trail left by the object.

Teardrop-shaped, pulsating, hovering object seen over water;2008-01-23 02:00:00;3 minutes;Teardrop-shaped, pulsating, hovering object seen over water Single object observed in the early morning. It changed colors, pulsating from red to green and back to red. Hovered in a single location of the sky, rather than following a trajectory, and smoothly drifted up and to the left or down and to the right intermittantly. Observed through binoculars did not see additional detail of the object, but did confirm that there were not two individual light sources - the object itself was changing colors.  Co-worker who lives in the same area observed three similar objects approximately 5 hours later, skimming over the water.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Stingray shaped object with red lights.;2013-10-04 00:20:00;3 seconds;Stingray shaped object with red lights. After getting home from night class for business school, I was standing on my back deck having a cigarette when I noticed one triangle/stingray shaped aircraft with amber/red lights outlining the shape, flying what appeared to be very low in a South to Southeast direction.  The object was either extremely low, extremely large, or both.   It moved in a straight line.  The aircraft made no sound and moved at least 4 times faster than I’ve ever seen a plane fly.  The object was out of my line of sight within 3 seconds.   I see planes all the time when I'm on my back deck and I've never seen anything even close to the shape and speed of this aircraft.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Tear/seed shaped flat black object hovering and moving slowly silent with no lights, it seemed to camouflage itself against the sky.;2016-04-22 00:30:00;40-50 seconds;Tear/seed shaped flat black object hovering and moving slowly silent with no lights, it seemed to camouflage itself against the sky. My boyfriend and I stepped onto our back porch, and I looked up and saw a solid black, tear shaped, almost hairy looking (I know that sounds weird but it wasn't shiny and there seemed to be something around it that gave it a spiky looking texture), object, headed 150 degrees SE of Seattle at around 3,500-4,000 ft.  It moved slowly, almost a floating motion with absolutely no sound, no lights. The moon was almost full, half of the sky was clear and the other half had low incoming clouds.  The object flew through the direct moonlight but there was no moonlight reflection on the object as if the object surface was a flat black.   The object seemed to slow down and hover as it reached a large group of clouds and became harder and harder to see, its outline became vague and soon, I could no longer spot it.  It seemed to camouflage itself against sky.  When it was against the clear sky, it was impossible to see until it was in the moonlight.  It ended up kind of blending with the clouds it approached.  Size wise, it was smaller than a 747, but larger than a minivan.   My boyfriend didn't have his glasses on so he did not see the details I did but he did see its movement.
