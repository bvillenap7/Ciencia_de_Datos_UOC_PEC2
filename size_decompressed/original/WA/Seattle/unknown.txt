Starwars dog-fight in the night sky.;1978-06-15 22:30:00;30 Sec;Starwars dog-fight in the night sky. Early summer about 1978, my friend and I were watching the stars with a small telescope and binoculars on my garage roof.  We did this a lot.   This night we watched two star like objects chase each other for about 20 seconds.  The rear object matched the lead objects direction and course, so we felt the rear object was chasing the lead object.  Then we saw a bright beam of light emmit from the rear object that struck the lead object. The lead object dissappeared.  The rear object stopped for about 5-10 seconds then took off in another direction dissappearing from our sight.   We don't know what we witnessed but, it sure looked like some type of combat dog-fight in our night sky amoung our stars. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Two adult witnesses are stunned by the sound of an object that streaks above the home they are in.;1988-10-10 22:45:00;2 sec.;Two adult witnesses are stunned by the sound of an object that streaks above the home they are in. I was hosting a friend from Alaska, who works there as a boat captain, and who had just arrived in Seattle on the bus earlier in the day.  We were sitting in the living room of the home where I lived in Ballard, waiting for friends to come home.  I seem to recall that they had gone to a movie.  Just minutes before they arrive back at the house, both I and my friend were shocked to hear some type of aerial object STREAK overhead, moving generally, we agreed, from southeast to northwest.  It was the (angular) velocity of the object, and the THOROUGHLY BIZARRE nature of the sound, that captured our attention immediately, and left us both stunned, and staring at one another in disbelief.  My friend, who admitted to me immediately after the incident that she had never believed in the possibility of UFO’s, turned to me and stated that THAT object was a UFO!!  Her eyes were as big as tea cups as she said it, as she turned in my direction in a state of obvious shock and disbelief!   The sound that emanated from the object, in the opinion of both of us, consisted of two distinct, distinguishable sounds.  One sound was a very high-pitched whining, buzzing, or perhaps even screeching tone, not too dissimilar from the sound of a high-speed hydraulic pump, running at very high speed.  Another close equivalent to the high-pitched sound is the distinct buzzing sound that the human ear can detect from either a Boeing 747, or a DC-10, as it passes overhead at a high power setting.  To my ear, the sound I am trying to describe here has a slightly metallic quality to it, combined with the peculiar buzzing sound one might expect to hear from a bee hive, or from a large swarm of bees in flight.  The other sound was a very low-pitched, deep rumbling sound.  In mirth, I often equate it to the bubbling sound one would hear from a very large cauldron at a slow boil with four missionaries being boiled down into a thick gravy.  Rather like a rapid blub, blub, blub.  I cannot emphasize enough with words how thoroughly bizarre, and unearthly, this sound was, and how it immediately commanded our attention.  We heard it, I estimate, for not more than TWO SECONDS, as it streaked overhead at what seemed to me to be almost directly above us.  Now, the velocity of the source of the sound.  The object was moving at a stunning angular velocity overhead.  I estimate that the object making the sound passed through from 140 to 160 degrees of arc, again from southeast to northwest, in less than two seconds!!  This object could not have been any kind of terrestrial aircraft that I am aware of!  Given that there was absolutely no trace of the sound that would have been generated by a propeller, or from either the main- or tail-rotor of a helicopter, I conclude that the object could not have been either a fixed-wing or rotor-wing aircraft.  As to my credentials, I have held a commercial pilot rating for over a quarter century (Flight Instructor for 10 years), and I have been around aircraft all my life.  My father worked in the airline industry for many decades, and I lived for a portion of my life with a family in the U. S. Air Force.  I know what aircraft sound like, and I know what they are capable of doing.  I cannot imagine that the object I heard on this particular Monday night could have been either built, or flown, by humans. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Peter B. Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting Center, Seattle, WA.  This is one of several truly bizarre experiences, seemingly UFO-related, that I have had during my lifetime.

Complex, dark and silent, as it floated over my house.;1998-08-15 22:30:00;15 seconds;Complex, dark and silent, as it floated over my house. Ok, first of all... ok I go out on my front porch in west seattle to have a smoke. As always...I look up I love watching the stars. I notice that the WHOLE sky ceiling is moving. I stand up and walk into the yard to focus. I see the underside of something. Its dark grey and complex with sections and pipes and its just unbelievable. TOTALLY silent. It moves south-I mentioned in my email that it was south south east. NO. It was south south west. Moving towards Vashon Island at about 30MPH. It was maybe a couple hundred yards up, MASSIVE and just floating along. I screamed to my Dad who was in the living room watching TV. He would not come out. He was in a bad mood and wanted to watch his show. He finally came outside after it was gone and bitched at me.What the ((deleted)) are you yelling about! Obviously there was nothing there when he came out so he bitched even more. We argue to this day over it but I have NO ground to stand on. In my mind Ive sort of disgarded it as irrelevent because who can I talk to about it? Nobody. When the subject comes up with others....he gets a sly grin. Im like...you have NO idea. Youre ignorant. So there it is. Its real. IT IS real. So anyway thats my experience. I know what I saw.

It was a brighter white than the whitest clouds. I was driving (I believe toward Seattle, but I am not sure which direction I was driving), and I saw a perfectly square object between two clouds.  I moved my head in all directions, thinking it might be a reflection in my windshield.  It remained as white and square as it first appeared.  I was so shocked that I failed to note the time, direction or even the date of the event.  In seconds, it disappeared behind one of the clouds.  It almost looked as if the could moved in front of the object.  The object was on the same level as my eyes, so I knew it was nothing close to the ground or the mountains.  I cannot recall whether it was over the mountains, or whether it was north.  My sense tells me that it was over the Olympic mountains, but I just am not sure.  I was a legal secretary/wordprocessor for many years.  At present and for the last year, I am self-employed as a caregiver for senior citizens on Mercer Island, where I reside.

Dark object in the shape of a (4) after dusk in West Seattle;2000-10-10 21:30:00;10 sec;Dark object in the shape of a (4) after dusk in West Seattle I was in my backyard smoking after my kids went to bed. It was about 1/2 an hour after sundown. I was looking to the North and saw something coming south from the north. As it got closer I was able to see what looked like several round globes, white in color, in the shape of a four (4) with the top of the 4 the front and the leg of the 4 at the back. Each globe was approximately 1-2 feet in diameter and spaced about 10 feet apart. It took around 15 globes to make the shape. I only saw the globes because of the lights from the street and houses reflecting off of them. They were obviously attached to the structure of the object as I could the stars blotted out as it passed directly overhead. The 4 shape was only about 100 feet overhead or the light from the street and houses would not have illuminated the globes the top half of the globes were part of the structure. It was a dark object and emitted no light. It flew in a perfectly straight line following the ridge where the South Seattle Community College is located. It made no sound whatsoever.

Thinking it was a plane I kept watching and the object didn't move so I called a friend over to look at it.  It appeared to be very small and possibly 2 miles away.  Then we spotted another one close by the first one.  As time went on I noticed a third object that slowly moved tword the other 2.  Beyond the three objects I noticed a cluster of very tiny objects (possibly much further away).  The objects were white and did not move erraticly but seemed to move slowly.  Eventually they moved north out of view.  I cannot identify what I saw and don't believe that they were balloons.

Possible Aurora Sighting Over Seattle;2001-09-19 18:46:00;3 mins.;Possible Aurora Sighting Over Seattle Must have been an SR-71 (any still flying?) or Aurora-type, high altitude, enormously fast craft.  A vehicle streaming two contrails from the direction of 335-345 degrees true overflew Seattle/Issaquah, WA area.  Made a high speed, 180 U-turn directly overhead and departed area at very high speed.  Estimate altitude at 35,000 feet.  Diameter of turn estimated at 2.5 miles.  Time from directly overhead to beyond visible horizon heading toward NWest approximately 25 seconds.  Vehicle was audible entire time, but shape of vehicle could not be discerned due to altitude.  Sun still up, but dusk approaching.  Very loud noise consistent with un-hushed military jet engines.  No doubt of military origin, but speed, altitude and flight path (plus solo operation) tend to rule out air cap flight due to recent events.  Sure you'll get other reports.

Peculiar, shapeless object with several distinct lights seen streaking over Greenlake Park in Seattle.;2002-10-17 19:13:00;2-3 sec.;Peculiar, shapeless object with several distinct lights seen streaking over Greenlake Park in Seattle. I was walking around Greenlake with a friend, when I proposed that we stop at an appropriate point on the paved path we were on to attempt to observe the overflight of the Space Shuttle and the International Space Shuttle, which I knew were scheduled to occur at approximately 19:09 and 19:13 hrs., respectively.  The Space Shuttle, Atlantis, had undocked from the Space Station, and the Shuttle was several minutes ahead of the Station, preparing to return to Cape Kennedy on the following day (October 18, 2002). As we stood, scanning the evening sky to the west, searching for the Space Station, both of us witnessed a peculiar object STREAKING across the sky, covering an estimated 10-15 degrees of arc (from our vantage point), traveling from our right to left, in approximately 2-3 seconds.  The object appeared to have several point sources of light on it, perhaps 3 to 5 of them, each approximately the color of a green LED, and it subtended an arc of approximately one-half a degree, i.e. equal approximately to the width of a thumbnail held at arm's length.  At just about the time both observers commented on the object's appearance, it just faded from our vision in approximately 1 second, or less.  It appeared to travel at a constant angular velocity throughout the sighting, i.e. it did not appear to slow. Since it was just past dusk at the time, the object was not easily visible to us, except for its lights, although it appeared to have structure.  During the short time we witnessed it, the several lights on the side facing us (its port side) did not appear to change position relative to each other.  Both witnesses were left with the distinct impression that they were looking at some kind of unidentifiable, solid object. The object's high angular velocity across the sky rules out any type of conventional aircraft.  Any aircraft moving across the sky at that angular velocity would have had to be close enough to the observers that its engine(s) would have been easily audible.  I have held a commercial pilot's license for over 25 years (flight instructor for 10 of those years), and the object was strikingly unlike anything I have ever witnessed. We discussed whether the object might have been a fragmented meteor in the extreme distance, following its terminal burst in the lower atmospere.  However, both observers felt that what they had witnessed was not consistent with such a scenario there appeared to be some kind of structure between the lights of the object. We do not know what we witnessed, but it was a striking image. Submitted by Peter B. Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting Center.

Possible abduction? MILAB? Strange visit from the health department?;2003-04-19 00:00:00;unknown;Possible abduction? MILAB? Strange visit from the health department? Hello  An incident occured on the night before Easter in 2003, and its been nagging at me and my family since.  That night, my mother, who had a nasty respitory illness, woke up in what she described was like a drug induced haze (she was once a nurse in Emergency rooms, and has herself had a few surgeries, and thus knows very well what medical anesthesia feels like, and she said this was very similar). She saw fuzzy images of what appeared to her as best she could tell, were people in full surgical garb. One of the doctors called her by name, told her everything would be ok. She remebers a needle being inserted in her arm, and blood taken. She couldnt speak, other than grunt, and was very confused before she blacked out again.  The next morning she woke up. She saw a needle pincture in her arm and was very concerned. My stepfather, who was also in the bed with her, woke. He also had one, which scared him. To understand better, my stepfather has a serious phobia of needles. When he sees the doctor, he must be sedated before they can poke any sort of needle into him, because he literally vomits and passes out on seeing needles. he often must leave the room when they doctors take blood from my mother. He remebered nothing, but was feeling very drowsy and run down, and felt confused. They both came in and asked me if I had let paramedics in the night before, and I told them no.  That night, I myself was playing on my computer. Since I was working a grave yard shift at the time, I had only woken up at about 8 P.M. Yet after 2 hours of being awake, I suddenly was overcome with such drowsiness and exhaustion, I simply crawled onto the cot I slept on, and fell asleep within minutes, which was VERY strange. I woke up feeling sore all over, which was weird, but no puncture or needle marks on my arms at all, and no recollection of anything the night before.  When they both showed me these strange needle marks, i was indeed very interested. They told me they themselves fell asleep suddenly, probably around the same time i did, judging by what was on TV when they fell asleep.  What was even weirder is that my cats, all of them were very spooked the next day. This was very interesting, as my largest cat never gets spooked. Vacuum cleaners, dogs, loud sounds, nothing phases him, yet I found him hiding under a bunch of boxes, and he hissed at me everytime i tried to reach in and get him. The other cats were terrified and hiding in other places.  My stepfather also told me the door was unlocked. I remeber him locking the door every night, and remembered him doing that. We lived in a bad area (White Center) and always made sure it was locked, but the door seemed locked, and the cats would go no where near it.  Anyway, this whole thing was very strange. We have been puzzling over it for these past two years, and Ive done a bit of research, and cannot seem to find any possible explainations. Although I have always been interested in the UFO phenomenon, and have done alot of personal research and study, and even had a sighting years ago, at that time, it seemed that the alien abduction theory was not a serious question.  However, as I do more looking into it, I have become a bit more confused. I feel that perhaps submitting a report to NUFORC would be the best option. If you folks dont do abduction reports, feel free to send it on to whoever you feel would be best for this subject, if it is indeed typical of abductions. If there is a mundane explaination, like a bizarre midnight visit from the health department (the SARS epidemic was big news at the time, and my mother did have a bad lung infection), Id like to know as well. Im really interested in getting to the bottom of this high strangeness and am looking for an answer, mundane or otherwise.  Feel Free to contaqct me for any further information by phone or email or other, and Ill be happy to answer any questions.  Thank you.  Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
dark, blimp-like object over Seattle;2003-09-26 13:15:00;1/2 hour;dark, blimp-like object over Seattle I'm not quite sure what I saw, but in the distance, approximately 5-8 miles away, there was a slow-moving, black object in the sky. It was coming from the north of Seattle, heading south toward downtown Seattle, then moved east, toward Kirkland. At first it looked like the shape of a blimp because it was rather large and it couldn't have been a plane because it moved slowly. I'm just curious if anyone else in Seattle saw this. I was at a distance, without binoculars, so it could be something normal like a blimp, but it seemed rather odd at the time.

I was looking due East and happened to look up just as this object went by. I'm pretty sure that it was a shooting star, but it wasn't like any shooting star that I've ever seen! The object was W shaped, with the bottom half of the W facing east. The tail was a brilliant orange color, and the W was an intense blue-green. It was moving at a high rate of speed, and seemed to dissapate as it neared the ground. The tail was about two inches by hand-held finger length in the sky. I have no doubt that it was a meteor burning up in the atmostphere, but it was so low to the ground, and the W shape of the blue-green head makes me wonder.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Strange hovering and engineless jet noises too near for comfort.;2003-10-31 03:40:00;15-20 minutes;Strange hovering and engineless jet noises too near for comfort. Last night I was just falling back asleep when I heard a few strange noises.  I live near the airport so just assumed them to be airplanes at first.  The noises sounded like airplanes coming in for landing, but there was no sound of engines just that of something moving through the air quickly.  I've lived near the airport most of my life, so I know these were unusual noises.  About five minutes after I first heard the noises a new noise came to me.  At first it was distant, a few blocks away, but soon it was near enough to be over my neighbors across the alley.  It sounded like something hovering.  It grew near till it was extremely loud, paused for 30 seconds to a minute and then slowly went away.  There was another similar hovering noise, but it seemed fairly distant.  Honestly I was too scared to get out of bed, not to mention too cold, so I stayed in bed for nearly 10 more minutes before I woke my fiance and told him what I had heard.  You could still hear the sound of something travelling the sky without a jet engine, but there was no more hovering.  Around 4:30 you could finally hear actual Jet engines either taking off or landing, so no more anomaly like noises for the night. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness heard, but we wonder whether it might have been the vortices in the air, generated off the tips of landing airliners.

Three rapidly sparkling objects hovering over Seattle to the WSW, two left after short time, one remained.  ((NUFORC:  Star??));2004-02-29 23:20:00;55Min+;Three rapidly sparkling objects hovering over Seattle to the West, Southwest, two left after short time, one remained. While taking a walk on Capitol Hill overlooking Downtown Seattle toward the waterfront on a cloudy night, we noticed a rapidly sparkling object in the sky about 23:20 hours. At first we thought it was a helicopter hovering but it was really high in the sky, too high for most helicopters and it had no FAA strobe pattern.  It was sparkling at a rapid pace changing colors all the while and it would momentarily dim out during this sparkling action.  It would change colors from a bright white to yellow, blue, bright red, and green could be seen just before it dimmed.  The colors listed are not necessarily in order of display as it sparkled but all would be regularly present.  We watched it for almost an hour hoping it would move or do something but all it did was hover in the same spot.  No starfield was visible this night and it was too close and bright to be a star but higher than most helicopters would be seen at.  No way to tell how close it was but used a streetlight pole to determine that it wasn't moving from the position it was in the sky.  The moon would move position slightly in the sky during the hour that we watched the object but the object did not move.  Finally, we were cold from standing still so long and since it was not moving or doing anything decided to go back in and stopped observing the object at aprox 00:10 hours. I must say that we saw two other objects that matched description of the main object but the two other ones were further away and disappeared from view.  Not sure if they flew away in the opposite direction to us or if they literally disappeared.  The were in a row stretching out to the west.  The one in the middle appeared to be more faint than the one on the far (west most) end.  All sparkled the same so as to appear to be the same type.  Could not tell precisely what the shape of the objects were but if we had to guess we would say it was disc shaped.  As far as duration of sighting on these other two objects, the faint one in the middle was observed only briefly and we got the sense it was further away the west most was observed for at least ten minutes.  The main one that remained was in the sky southwest toward West Seattle and more west than southwest.  If straight up was 12 O'Clock in the sky and one assigned the value of 6 O'Clock to the horizon then the persistant object is estimated to have been at about the 4:45 level.

High Flight Speed Star Bright Lit Object Flying Toward Boeing Field Making Sharp TurnsThen South Of It and to Renton Field;2004-06-20 23:00:00;90 seconds;High Flight Speed Star Bright Lit Object Flying Toward Boeing Field Making Sharp TurnsThen South Of It and to Renton Field At 11:00 pm on Sunday, 6-20-04, approximately one-half mile before the W. Marginal Way exit, while driving north on highway 509 coming down the hill toward the First Avenue Bridge, I saw a medium size star bright lit object above me, about the altitude of 10K feet, moving from my left to my right as an extreme high rate of speed. It flew in an extreme straight line of flight direction with no slight movement, but with great accuracy in one direction.  It was flying downward at a slant toward the north end of Boeing Field just a tad before it reached that field where it made, in less than 1 second, an approximate 100 degree south-southerly turn, the white star light dropping down, like in a bank turn, to then quickly upward in a steady rise to leveling out going south toward the south end of Boeing Field, it’s speed dropping maybe 10-15 percent after that first turn. It then began to drop lower downward and slowing to about 50 percent less speed, going into a soft rounded south-west-westerly bank turn, the light dropping to the right downward then leveling up and out, for a distance of about one-fifth of a mile, then another similar sharp turn but to a sharp north-north-easterly direction for about the same distance, the light moving upward to the left and then leveling out, then another similar turn south-south-westerly for the same distance, the light moving down to the right and then leveling out, and then one more such turn but wider into a north-east-easterly direction, the light moving to the left upward and then leveling out, where it was then flew out of sight past the hill to the west of the Boeing Renton air field. I could not make out the shape of the object the light was attached to, but over the freeway I had the distinct image of it being long and narrow, but after the turns it made then more like a plane, but that could have been my eyes playing tricks with trying to attach some shape to it. It had no other lights on it. At first I thought it was a shooting star but it was ! not moving in a curve. Then I thought it was a comet, but it didn’t have a changing tail behind it – it did have a tail, but very very faint, but I knew it was too close to the earth to be a comet. Then I thought it was a meteorite since one fell near Chehalis recently. Then I thought it might have been a plane coming in for a crash or emergency landing to Boeing Field. And I also thought it might be a cruise missile or test drone craft that Boeing might be testing. I really did expect an explosion so the whole incident was quite scary causing me to quickly cross all the lanes on the freeway from the left to the right emergency lane to stop where I called 911 to report it.

At between approximately 4:00am and 4:30am I was looking at the stars and saw what appeared to be a very high flying aircraft, flying s;2004-08-01 04:00:00;3-5 seconds;At between approximately 4:00am and 4:30am I was looking at the stars and saw what appeared to be a very high flying aircraft, flying southwest over the downtown area of Seattle. The movement is what caused the object to catch my eye, the object was approximately the same size and brightness of the visible stars in the clear sky. It produced no discernable sound. I watched as the object flew, at a slow and steady rate, and then appeared to vanish, almost as if the light of the aircraft had slowly faded out. The object itself appeared to get smaller. The entire even took approximately 3 seconds. I've seen 2 other instances of this type, in the same general area, occuring in the past couple of months. It is possible that these objects are simply sattelites, as I don't know what satelites look like in orbit, although I'm not sure they fade from view. I know they are not comets or meterorites because, in the two or three instances I've seen these objects, they are not streaking through the sky at a fast rate nor do they leave a trail/tail behind them. Additionally, the objects appear to be leaving the atmosphere (fading) after a short duration, not entering the atmosphere.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Shiny distant metallic silver object through binoculars at sunset...Associated with a rising black balloon-like object.;2005-06-13 20:34:00;4 minutes;Shiny distant metallic silver object through binoculars at sunset...Associated with a rising black balloon-like object. While eating outside I looked to the NW (the direction of the setting sun on this mostly clear day under weak surficial high pressure) and noted interesting cloud fomations that I looked at through binoculars.  Much to my amazement from 2034p-2038p through the binoculars I noted a silver object (elv. 30 degrees at 285 degrees, i.e. close to the horizon to the WNW) of undetermined shape far in the distance moving VERY slowly (one twentieth the speed of a plane) and either slowing its motion or stopping every few seconds.  It was going so slowly that I really could not tell its intended direction, if any, perhaps N to S.  It was so far away that I could not make out its shape with ordinary 7X binoculars.  It was metallic silver and shiny and would have irritated the eyes if it had been closer.  Note: It was SO SMALL that I would NOT have detected it if I had not already been looking through binoculars at the time.  At 2038, a large black balloon-like object probably closer to me began moving upwards with the prevailing surface winds towards the object! (SW to NE under weak surficial high pressure).  The two objects never came in contact.  Then at 2038p I stopped to take notes thinking the silver object would just stay there and cooperate.  Well, of course, UFO’s never do, and by 2039p I could not find either object.  Conclusion:  While the silver object is a UFO since it has no explanation, the black object that was clearly below 5,000’ may have been a balloon escaping from the wealthy citizens who hold summer parties down the hill.  Anyway, I’m sure there are thousands of distant shiny silver objects reported to you that really have no significance.  Many are probably airplanes with the rising or setting sun.  However, in this instance the object was more or less stationary for 4 minutes.  But it is certainly possible that it was an airplane departing to the WNW at 285 degrees and catching the setting sun.  Yet four minutes is a long time (2034-2038).  I have some experience in meteorology yet none in aviation...and I certainly know that atmospheric illusions occur at sunset and sunrise.  I would hope to think of an alternative explanation for this yet for now it remains a UFO.  The black balloon adds interest, but I can’t say for sure if it really was a balloon from a party or not.

Object with rows of very bright, clear lights around perimeter hovering silently 1-2 minutes before exiting.;2006-02-10 17:25:00;1-2 minutes;Object with rows of very bright, clear lights around perimeter hovering silently 1-2 minutes before exiting. An object was seen hovering silently at an approximate altitude of 1000'. Its exact shape was obscured by the brightness of its lights, as well as the vapor which appeared to be underneath it and somewhat around it (this was not a particularly cloudy day).  However, the bottom of the object was circular, it had several rows of circular, clear-lens lights around its perimeter (sides), so it appeared to be either cylindrical, conical or saucer-like.  Again, its top was not clearly visible, as well as its sides (other than the lights). (See sketch provided).  This object hovered for at least 1-2 minutes, then exited, leaving no signs of its presence.  The vapor was white in color, somewhat thick, and was underneath the object, as opposed to being behind it while it was moving across the horizon.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
4 white objects west of Seattle;2006-05-20 09:45:00;1;4 white objects west of Seattle I was at the intersection of Broadway and Olive St. on Capitol Hill in Seattle, looking west at the Olympic mountains at about 9:45am.  I spotted (4) objects moving south at a steady speed.  They were traveling in a line, one after another, closely spaced and evenly spaced.  They were bright white in color, although due to their distance from me I could not discern their shape.  In spite of their distance from me, however, they appeared to be quite large.  The (4) objects did not appear as points of white, but rather were larger and each had a horizontal dimension slightly greatly than their vertical dimension.  They were traveling close enough to the ground that they were passing in front of the Olympic mountains.  The appeared to me to be traveling along the tops of the foothills just in front of the Olympic mountains.  They were traveling level or nearly level  they did not appear to be gaining or losing elevation.  I am reporting the above because I have not been able figure what they may have been -- they are unidentified to me.  I am not assuming them to be alien craft, but I am not ruling it out either.

I stopped and watched it, thinking it might be a jet - but it stayed in the same spot, behind the clouds, for a number of minutes. The object was extremely far away, but I could tell that it was metallic. I thought I saw it wavering back and forth a little bit, but it was hard to tell as it was so far away. I stayed in the same spot and watched it for about five minutes, at which point clouds rolled over and I lost it. I couldn't find it in the sky after that point, but the object never fully came out of the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Strange objects in the morning sky over Seattle - on Halloween.  ((NUFORC Note:  A contrail, we believe.

When driving to my house in West Seattle, my sister (who was traveling south on Interstate 5) sent me a text message telling me about 2 objects in the sky that seemed to be flying towards one another. She made a joke about the fact that it looked like a jet intercepting some kind of UFO. I brushed her comments off at first, assuming she just saw jets or something typical of the Seattle area.  About 10-15 minutes later, after she had arrived, I was looking outside in my backyard and saw the exact same type of objects she saw.  There were several of these high altitude objects in the sky over the next 20 minutes or so. Some looked like jets, but a few did not. I'm no expert here, so for all I know these could be extremely high jets or it could just be a NORAD exercise or something, but someone said I should post it here so I did.  Luckily, I caught some video of a couple of the objects.  Here's a link to the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ofjc7RiqPw#GU5U2spHI_4 ((NUFORC Note:  A contrail, we believe.

Distant dancing light in the sky southeast of Seattle for prolonged time;2007-10-13 23:00:00;over 2 hours;Distant dancing light in the sky southeast of Seattle for prolonged time My 2 older brothers (26 and 25) were outside our house talking at about 11pm last (Tuesday) night, as they were looking at the stars, one of my brothers pointed out a “bright star” that he thought was a planet in the southeast sky, almost directly east of Orions hand, my other brother argued that it was a plane, pointing out that while it appeared the same size and brightness as a star, it was flashing blue and red, like a commercial airliner. However it appeared to not be moving, and all of sudden it shot off to the west, then back east. It was moving side to side, and up & down, at a slow pace. Then it would move in circles and zig-zags, continuing these patterns for hours. My brothers came inside to get me out of bed and pointed it out to me, I saw it doing everything they had claimed it was doing. Through taking a look at different angles and using different reference points we were able to establish that it was between 50 and 100 miles away, likely over North Bend, Washington. The unidentified light was out before they went outside, at approx. 11pm, and remained out until we all went to bed, after 1am, but it continued moving around and would be in different spots ranging from directly south to directly southeast, constantly moving, then stopping, and changing the pattern of it’s flight. We can’t come up with any logical reason for any sort of craft to stay in an area for so long, but it quite clearly was moving in a fashion unlike any craft we have ever seen on earth.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Abduction;2008-01-03 15:00:00;5min;Abduction   My wife and I had fallen asleep on the sofa bed in our living room. I woke up and looked at the vcr which read 2:41. There was an odd buzzing noize and a strange light pattern on the cieling above us. I heard scuffling sounds in the kitchen behind my head and became intensely afraid. Just as I was about to investigate three distinct figures with huge heads and small bodies glided into the room. The room was dark but I could plainly see that they were not human! There is light from the street that comes in enough to where i can make out a face. These things were wearing dark coveralls that ere tight and showed off skinny bodies. They also wore msaks of some kind and all i could see as far as thier faces went was thier huge black eyes surrounded by patches of light skin in the eye slits of the masks. Thier beltlines were about level with the bed so i guees they are about 4' tall. I was NOT asleep or dreaming! I was immediately terrified out of my mind and tried to scream but could not even move. It was as if a nightmare was coming true. Supe-sureal as the people who witnessed 9-11 must have felt as the planes hit or towers came down. One stood at the foot of the bed and the other two were on my side. Mywife stayed asleep. they were making strange noises as if breathing through ventilators. Ialso heard mechanical sounds. Almost immediately I was lifted into the air afoot or two as if by magic. I could still feel the skin of my wife's shoulder under my hand and the blanket on top of us as well as open space and cool air below. I sensed movement all around and the room seemed to wobble and spatially distort. I tried to kick at them but could notmove so I tried to lean from side to side in the air. I calledout mentally for God and the Lord Jesus Christ to save me and instantly I was back on the bed and the beings and strange glow was gone. The Lord saved me from those things. It was not as if I was set down or just woke up. It was as if one moment I was up in the air and the next moment I was down. I didn't even blink! They were gone! I know that this was no dreamas it seemed real and the memory hasn't faded one bit as dreams do. i woke up my wife in a panic but did notwant to scare her so I let her fall beck asleep without telling her until the next day. Besides Iknew that Jesus would not let them return. I remember that at least 20 minutes had passed but do not remember the time it was over exactly. I only remember less than a few minutes of it. Praise God!!! This is not the first time.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Slow red strobe light, static in position, high above air traffic;2008-11-21 19:30:00;10-12 minutes;Slow red strobe light, static in position, high above air traffic I am making this report hoping that others may have seen what I saw. I would also like to preface my report by saying that over the past few months, I have taken more of an active interest in the UFO phenomenon and its associated conspiracy theories. I find myself looking more into the skies as my belief system is changing as more and more reliable sources and disclosers are coming forward. Also in this report, I make no speculation as to what I might have seen it is simply a report of my observation at the time. On Friday, November 21 at approximately 7:30 pm, I and my wife were driving to Seattle from the Eastside. We were driving east on I-90 across the floating bridge between Mercer Island and Seattle. The skies were clear that evening and the brightest stars were appearing. On such on occasion, I look more carefully into the skies. I was driving and my wife was riding. I noticed the heavy flight traffic as many airliners were landing with a southerly approach to SeaTac airport over downtown Seattle. As I was watching the planes come in, I noticed that in the approximate vicinity of the airport, at about 10 o’clock from my perspective somewhere between 35 and 40 degrees in the sky, I noticed a reddish light strobing slowly on and off (at intervals of 1-2 seconds on, 1-2 seconds off).  I could make out no discernible shape, and it seemed very far away, perhaps over the airport, but extremely high in the sky (I noted the object relative to the altitude of incoming aircraft).  It was a static object and reminded me of the red strobes of construction cranes.  However, there are no cranes in that direction and it was impossibly high in the air for a land-based construction.  My impression was that it was unlikely a helicopter, because relative to the air traffic it was higher than any helicopter flight I had witnessed. The drive across the bridge, on which I had a great view (traffic was light that evening, allowing me to look around a bit).  I kept watching for the two minutes across the bridge.  Once in Seattle, we made our way (5-7 minutes) to Capitol Hill where we parked and went to a concert.  Once out of the car, I could see at one point along the streets that the red blinking light was still in place. I did not mention it to my wife as I wanted to think through it before blurting out what I saw.  Today, we happened to meet a friend and the topic of UFO’s came up, which brought the memory back.  I decided to report my impressions hoping that others might have seen the same thing.  It was early enough and clear enough skies that there would have been plenty of opportunity for others to see the same thing.  I noticed the light for at least 10-12 minutes from the time I saw it on the bridge to the time we drove into town and parked.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Shooting star has a mind of its own...;2008-12-14 00:00:00;30 seconds;Shooting star has a mind of its own... At 3 AM on December 14th 2008 I was on a boat coming in from a long night out.  Our vessel was coming into a pier on the Seattle waterfront. I was a crew member who had to set my lines (to tie up the vessel) on the stern (back of the boat), and we were about 10 minutes out  from the pier. Since the boat was large I could not communicate or see the captain or the mate >>(who was getting lines ready at the front of the boat). << I got my lines ready and was anticipating going home soon. Since I had to stay at the stern, I just waited and looked around.  I looked west across Elliott Bay, across the Puget Sound and to the Olympic Mountains. ( the Olympics are about 40-50 miles west of Seattle) It was a cold beautiful night, lots of stars and a few clouds at the base of the Olympics. At the southern part of the mountain range I saw a shooting star falling hard and fast from the sky . I thought “cool” I’m going to make a wish! The star started to intensify getting brighter. I began to think to myself “WOW, that thing is going to smash into the mountains and there’s going to be a huge flash” But as  it came down, it stopped abruptly halfway down the mountain range, turned a glowing red and shot horizontally northward. The red light never blinked or changed color. It moved so fast that I could not believe what I was seeing!? It moved faster than anything I have ever seen. As it moved, it illuminated the cloud formations nestled along the lower side of the mountain range. I watched it until it disappeared at what I could say was Hurricane Ridge, Port Angles area ( I know it disappeared northwesterly  of the Olympics.)

object moving in a very erratic way, changing colors, very high up;2009-03-25 22:00:00;15 min;object moving in a very erratic way, changing colors, very high up Hi,  I live on Evanston in Fremont. I stepped out to take out the trash at 10p tonight, looked up to find the dipper and was surprised the sky was so clear. I saw the dipper almost immediately, then my eyes traveled over to the NW...  I first saw a consistently moving satellite moving left to right, then I was struck by a blue red and white…lit-up object that was moving in a pattern I had never seen before. This object looked much like a typical star or planet initially. It moved left, then right, then in a semi-circular motion. It was slightly larger than a star and seemed to be very high in the sky, because it was difficult see it clearly.  The two most peculiar aspects of this object were the movements and the change of shape and color. It moved quickly in a swirling motion as well as at sharp angles before stopping completely and not moving at all. It at times moved slowly too.  It moved then stopped, then moved again with a very inconsistent frequency. At points, the object appeared to twist, or rotate to expose a three-light cluster. The colors changed at inconsistent intervals…nothing like an airplane. It was also unlike the flickering of any star I have seen;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Hovering then slowly moving black object silhouetted by grey clouds over Seattle, WA (videotaped).;2009-05-10 00:00:00;10+ Minutes;Hovering then slowly moving black object silhouetted by grey clouds over Seattle, WA (videotaped). On Mother's Day, we were eating our dinner on our deck on an overcast day. I notice a stationary back dot in the sky above Providence Hospital with grey clouds for a background. I told my wife, and she spotted it with my help. After watching it for a while, I decided to run inside and get my old video camera. I videotaped it with my elbows braced on the deck so I could show it's movement. At about the time I started filming it, it started drifting(?) to the east on a horizontal plain. At one point I tried to zoom out to get some scale and perspective, but lost it when I tried to zoom back in. After viewing the video on my big screen, you can see an object arching beneath the main object. It's hard to describe. Though even on the big screen the main object looks like a shapeless black object. I showed it to a bunch of friends last night, and they insisted the I have a expert look at the video. Hence this contact. I have yet to transfer the video to a digital form. My firewire card is not working. My background: I love physics and astronomy, and so I have a hard time believing we are being visited by other life forms....sorry. But I do believe in the term UFO. I was in Phoenix when the Phoenix Lights occurred, and I witnessed them from an overpass (Dunlap & I-17). I still believe they were government related.

When looking up, there were two objects blinking in the sky.  After watching them for some time, we noticed different colored lights and at first glance appeared to be stationary.  After going inside for a camera the objects had moved out of sight but then reappeared.  The two objects were not close together, as if one ship, but some distance away from one another.

Watched it the first one fly over.  It had more lights on it, could not make out it's actual shape.  could not even accurately describe it as an airplane, because the lights didn't seem configure in what i assume to be a typical manner.  shortly after first one advanced overhead the other one suddenly sped up and appeared to smoothly zoom across the same path.  I believe they were headed SW.  I thought th! ere was a humming noise, but there was a low flying jet that flew from the complete, opposite direction.   It seemed to intersect it's path and did have a different sound, but it muffled any noise i tried to distinguish from the two objects.  I saw red lights, a bright yellow and possibly a green one, it was early and my eyes were blurry.  I have pictures, but i couldn't get them close up, the are only bright yellow orange objects in the distance.  the peculiar thing about them was the hovering and then speeding up.

Voices that sound human but not human and being that are not human and humans that are NOT Human;2010-10-01 10:05:00;ongoing;voices that sound human but not human and being that are not human and humans that are NOT Human I was sitting in my home when I started to what sound like people talking low at first.  They where looking for someone named the Omega.  They talked about several thing but I never saw who was talking and that I would know them because they would talk blended with the wind.   Then they wanted me to come outside so I did and when I walked outside I noticed that there was an eclipe created by the moon. When I heard voice that told me to look up and I saw a ship but it was barely visable.  Then the craft disappeared and tha was the last time I saw that craft.  A series a event happened like someone was test my knowledge of events of the past, present, and future.  There is a park close to my house where a voice asked me to come and me someone. It was four right angles as I was guided my the voice and when I came to the park   I was instructed to go in a certain direction an push a spot in an figure that leaned against a series of triangles,retangles, that leaned to th! e left.  Then I was to stand ther but before this had  happened I saw a native American supposely to be a tribal nation looked like the wrong tribe but the eyes looked diffent than I have seen before because the one I saw that was in the mall had eyes that were blue but with white kind like specks not like or iris's. So, first went the port-a- pot when I came out then I walked to that structure but nothing then I went an sat on then bench. It was raining lighting an a figure appeared the being was almost light grey but see through at the same time. The being looked me in my face an I remember looking down an seeing a tranlucent worm that had what looked like squres and tringles in side it's body. Then I turn to leave an the being was gone and I went back home. I also remember talking to someone or a family from the voice I heard was a kid,mother,father, grandpa. We had several coversation about various subjects.I remember also at the mall the other which apeared human as we ! know was a brown haired woman she motioned towards a shirt bu! t didn't speak. I wasn't a weird was more like why was contacted but something went wrong. One minute I was sitting in the forest at night still talking to someone but I heard a noice an out the corn of my eye I was a slinder figure with long hair move across the path with quickness then he was gone.The srangest thing was the government made annoucement that they were conducting an test an if we heard something ignore it. Several day turned to months then some start yelling at me and one day while I was sitting in my chair  Iheard a strang sharp noise so loud that it made my ears hurt that I had to leave my home an go out side. I went to the doctors an he refered me to the audiolegist and they informed me that I had tenitious. An then about four months or so the same sound happened agin this it last sometimes fours and for several days. I t seemed like every where I went somebody or some being was testing my ears until I cried out in pain and  I heard a voice that told who ever was! doing that insane test to stop because it was hurting his ears.I went back a gain to the audiologist this time the test showed a 5% hearing an now my tenitious was worsted than before. Then thing started happening in my home that never happened before like items coming up missing and feeling like being wanted to look over my body naked. I felt buring temporary feeling on my throat while I sat in my chair doing my art. The bed moved in a wave like motion but I never saw who was in my room. I am a dibetic so one night I thought I was having a diabetic attack because I feel some leechs like suck ing on my kindey areas. I felt thing I never felt before on my back thight lie two snail like feeling but when I wipped my my leg because I I though something might have crawled on me because I slept on the floor but when I did that it went away an never came back. Because of the tentious that I have now every thinh is amplfied because the ears is damaged an now some of those voice I! hear now screems.But one night when I slept I happed to feel ! my mouth mve but when I looked up I was a light green being with maybe arms or tentagles sort floating above me then I went back to sleep. Another time I was sleep  an I happened to awake an I saw a pink and blue want appeared to be  what we call a snail an I looked an rolled over an went back to sleep. An between that time some people were standing out side an I didn't think much about expect when I walked pasted someone standing there an he spoke but he did'nt open his mouth to speak and spoke back with my mouth as we do.  So many thing happen I didn't know what to think then something happen while I was sitting in my chair I felt something crawl through my chair an I jumped up an something in now on my back especially every time I sit on any like right now. I went to the doctor an to see if he could see any thing but he could not its not a pain it is ignoring to have something you can not see but on your back on the spinal cors, kidney, and tailbone. All of this has been happen! ing as this day of Sept.10,2012 from what I can understand some if not all hate by who ever the beings are especial African American why they don't say. One day I am living a normal not I am just living why did this only god know but I will stand up for all those who can not stand because as the united stated denies the excistance or extresstrail that is a ball faced lie for now I am also brought from the darkness to the light.

Three Silver Unknown Objects Observed Over Western Seattle Sky;2011-07-23 17:00:00;15 Minutes;Three Silver Unknown Objects Observed Over Western Seattle Sky While observing kites at a local park, my eyes caught a silver reflection westward and at very high altitude.  The object appeared almost stationary, though it would move briefly in small, circular patterns before again hovering in place.  It also seemed as if the object was surrounded by a reflective glare.   The sky was perfectly clear, aside from a scattered number of cirrus clouds to the far south-west.  I quickly pointed out the object to my partner who was also able to observe the object and its behavior.   After several minutes, I then noticed a second object of the same description, and then a third shortly after.  Neither of these appeared to have the same brightness or reflection as the first.   At this point, a commercial aircraft cut through the field of vision, though it was at a significantly lower elevation. The three objects remained stationery and when viewed together formed a large triangle shape.  The second object then moved southward, passing the first by a short distance, and then again became stationary.  All three objects remained in this position for several minutes.   I removed my sunglasses to determine whether or not what I was seeing could have possibly been a reflection in the lenses.  I was still able to observe the objects with the naked eye.  My partner was able to track two of the objects but lost sight of the third.  I lowered my eyes briefly in order to regain focus and reduce eye strain.   The first and second objects where no longer visible and could not be found in the surrounding sky field.  The third object, however, remained it its previous position.   I observed for another few moments before again lowering my eyes.  I was unable to then relocate the third object.   Total observation is estimated at 15 minutes.   Both observers are successful health care providers.  One is also an educator.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Stationary object, Very brightlights, swooped to the NW into a fog bank.;2011-10-21 06:59:00;2 min;Stationary object, Very brightlights, swooped to the NW into a fog bank. This was taken on Melrose Ave. Between Denny and Olive this morning. The time date stamp should be on the video. This video does not do justice to what we saw.  It’s was large!  Way bigger than a helicopter.  This shot is looking towards two Union Square from Capital Hill  It was stationary for about one minute.  There were five bright white lights in a circle around the object flashing in a type of rotation.  One stationery bright light directly under the object.

From what must have been several miles away, I saw a metallic object (reflecting off of the sun) plummeting towards the earth, leaving a smoke trail.  From my vantage point, it looked like it could have descended somewhere in the vicinity of Vashon Island, or out in the ocean.  The object appeared to be large and descended straight down vertically.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Red green and golden yellow lights flying over Snoqualmie pass, Seattle WA.;2013-03-31 22:00:00;50 seconds;Red green and golden yellow lights flying over Snoqualmie pass, Seattle WA. Driving to Seattle over Snoqualmie pass yesterday around 10 pm, I saw five lights all connected to something.  The lights were small ovals all the same size the colors were red green and three golden yellow.  They switched colors between them selves. The whole thing was moving at a constant rate in one direction horizontally  but varied from slightly higher to lower over a period of about a minute.  The lights were part of a whole and stacked horizontally one after the other.  I noticed it from a distance above me and slowly got closer until it flew directly over my car.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
6 or more objects over Seattle Science Center/Space Needle, irregular movement, disappearing and reappearing;2013-04-10 18:00:00;15 minutes;6 or more objects over Seattle Science Center/Space Needle, irregular movement, disappearing and reappearing Its 12am now on 4/11/13 so technically yesterday on 4/10/13 I slept in on my day off to later meet my girlfriend at 4 and went to Alkai beach in West Seattle.  We arrived around 6. We sat down at the beach and drank coffee and tea and were talking about boats as we were looking around.  I was the first to notice what we saw. I could see the Seattle center area and space needle and that above it there were many white or off white things flying around. The things flew irregularly, they took sharp turns, while gaining altitude. Sometimes they would briefly remain still, but I couldn't tell if it was because they were moving towards/away from me, or remaining in place.  The objects would disappear frequently too, every 10-25 seconds.  Couldn't tell if it was because of clouds. My girlfriend could also see all of this.  First thing my roommate said to me when I woke up came to mind. &quotIts windy today&quot he said so I thought and told my girlfriend, They must be birds caught in the wind.  At the beach many birds were flying.  I could see some birds more on our side of the water, flying.  The birds were just about the same size as the more distant objects, all the way across the water by the science center/key arena area, in relation to my location at alkai.  Not sure if there were any events going on, I tried to find some online with my phone but found nothing. All the time about 15 minutes pass, after my eyes begin to become tired I decide to stop looking for only about a minute as my girlfriend and I continued to talk.  Roughly a minute later we both look back to search for another few minutes but don't see the objects anymore. We left the beach 10 minutes afterwards and went home. I've looked online and found no reports so far.   My girlfriend is 20 years old, she was born out of the country and has lived in Seattle a year now and currently works at the airport she came in from. I am 20 years old, and was born on Capitol Hill in Seattle. I am a cook/worker at Seattle Fish Company, not far from the Beach we were at.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Object with red and green lights hovered and then headed north disappearing from view in Fauntleroy neighborhood.;2013-06-15 21:45:00;15 seconds;Object with red and green lights hovered and then headed north disappearing from view in Fauntleroy neighborhood. I was sitting on our back deck with dinner party guests.  Home is located in Fauntleroy Woods.  Member of group said “What is that”?  All looked to the south over the tops of 100’ plus cedars in the neighborhood.  We saw what appeared to be a small object with red and green lights.  They were very bright and similar to LEDs based on past observations I have made of these types of light sources.  The lights appeared to be arranged in a tight square, two green and two red. Craft came up over the trees and hovered.  After approximately 5 seconds, it started accelerating to the NW until it was no longer viewable, due to the heights of nearby trees.  Our viewable horizon in that direction is approximately 60 degrees and above, essentially a circle of trees. It was clear to all viewing that this was not an airplane, satellite, or helicopter as there was no audible propulsion sound. Night was dead still with no wind.  We see air traffic daily as we are on the flight path for Boeing field (E to W, W to E) personal/private craft and are quite familiar with the sound and sights of such vehicles. The movement of the object definitely appeared to be “controlled” somehow.  Because of the low light it was impossible to judge size or distance but I would guess it was flying above Barton Ave, or the Fauntlee Hills neighborhood.  Holding one’s thumb out at arm’s length would have obscured it from view. Our guess was it was some sort of a remote controlled quad copter.  But it did have bright lights and was at a high altitude, 500’ at least.  I am aware that Li-ON power packs are able to illuminate LED light strips and have a friend who does so with radio controlled planes that he flies in North Bend, WA. We saw one satellite that night and it took the predictable E to W path in a straight line.  It definitely was not the same type of object. About one hour later we saw an extremely bright meteor.  It entered atmosphere directly above us and burned up in bright white light heading due south towards Burien/Tacoma.  It actually left a contrail which I have never seen before in person.  No sonic boom was heard.  That was amazing!  The hover, then transition to forward motion, colors, and absence of sound was what bothered everyone.  All agreed they had not seen something like that before.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
 A RED Light was seen over the Highland Park area of Seattle (((Drone?))).;2013-07-04 22:25:00;10 minutes;At around 10:15- to 10::30 Pm on the Fourth of July, A RED Light was seen over the Highland Park area of Seattle ((( Drone? ))) Last Night, I went outside to have a smoke and watch the Festivities around West Seattle. Looking toward the West, I saw a Dark RED light descending.  Even though it was The Fourth of July and Lights what , Flashes, where all over the place.  The light disappeared for about 5 Minutes, It began ascending slowly in the same part of the Sky,  The light either would go out from time to time because it appeared to disappear and reappear.  I would have chocked it up to Fireworks except that it flew right over me.   The only thing I could see was the Red Light and no sound.  The first thought I had was this could be Surveillance Drone as I am trying to pay attention to events around me.   I just thought that maybe someone else saw this light over the Highland Park Area of Seattle at around p10:20-25 PM 4rth Of July 2013.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Two orange very illuminated objects moved from west to east, slowed down and moved south and faded out.;2014-06-24 22:28:00;2 minutes;Two orange very illuminated objects moved from west to east, slowed down and moved south and faded out. Two orange illuminated objects went from west to east over the puget sound.  Illumination increased dramatically and objects slowed down to near stop.  Second object disappeared, first object turned south and slowly faded away.  Observed objects via binoculars and did not see any sign of aircraft strobe nor red/green navigation lights.  Bright orange illumination that was twinkling/flashing. The fact that the object slowed down and changed course made this really odd, in addition to the one object disappearing and the other fading away. At the same time an aircraft was lined up with 13R centerline on approach while traveling over Magnolia neighborhood.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

The lowest light moved vertically, and then we turned the car around to get a better view.  By the time we where able to see them again there was only one bright light left.   Around the only remaining bright light, there were tiny red blinking lights.   I'm not sure if there were many different objects, or if there were just a few that were quickly moving side to side.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Object had two green lights in front and two red lights in back. one blinking red light bottom center.  I first saw it stationary high above the Columbia Tower bldg, but after a few seconds it moved over by the waterfront at a high rate of speed dropped down and rose quickly back up and went behind Safeco Field out of my view.  Its movement was not smooth but as if the operator was giving the gas pedal short bursts or feathering it to keep it in motion.I had just left the ball field where I work and was sober.   I could hear no noise or sound from object and could not see the object, only the lights that made it seem like a four cornered craft, one light on each corner, green lights always in front.  I watched for about five min. flying back and forth staight up and down, no wide turns, dead stop then change directions.  I am 59 and never seen anything move like it.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Dozen brightly lit aircraft flying low and slow over Seattle.;2015-10-27 21:05:00;10 minutes;Dozen brightly lit aircraft flying low and slow over Seattle. There were 10 or 12 very brightly lit aircraft, flying too low and slow to be the usual jets approaching for landing at SeaTac.  They flew north to south, about a minute apart.  Underneath each were large outlines of arrows.  Some had 2 pointing in opposite directions, some had 2 pointing in same direction.  Arrow shapes consisted of lights. Some arrows were green, some were red,  I think one was blue, can't remember if other colors.  The lights did not flash or blink, just burned steady.  The aircraft sounded like small prop planes, not jets or helicopters.   I saw them first while sitting inside, looking north.  I went out to my porch in front, saw more as they came by, went to my back deck to continue watching.  They seemed to be flying roughly over I-5 route.   It was so odd, I forgot to try and get pictures.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Bright light with an a flash of an orange tail before disappearing behind the tall buildings dt Seattle.;2016-06-10 04:35:00;6 seconds;Bright light with an a flash of an orange tail, before disappearing behind the tall buildings of downtownt Seattle. I'm in my apartment on 8th and Madison, facing west, when I noticed a bright white light moving fairly fast towards the water.  It's late, and I've been studying for a test, so my initial thought was I saw the lights on a plane landing.   Then I realized if it was a plane, it would have to be extremely close to appear to be moving as fast as it was.  As I'm standing up to get a better look at it, I see an orange steak of like behind it.   Next thought is the largest shooting star I've ever seen, and at nearly 5 in the morning.  Next thought was make a firecracker set off from a building?  Where I viewed it from, it appeared over the Rainer tower though, so I would have no idea where the firecracker would have been sent off from. I don't believe in UFO's, but this is the only place I could think of to turn to for an explanation.   Hopefully, someone else saw it too, and could let me know.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Strange flashes of light on a clear night in Sno-King area of WA.;2016-07-22 00:00:00;3 hours;Strange flashes of light on a clear night in Sno-King area of WA. At around midnight, I started watching a movie on television.  For the record, the movie was Straight Out Of Compton, which I mention only to disway any notions that I was watching anything related to the paranormal and my imagination got the best of me thoughts of UFOs were very far from my mind!  Just to the left of my TV is a large, south-facing window that I keep open this time of year.  While there are a few tall but thin trees across the street from me, I have a pretty good view of the sky from where I was sitting (on my couch).   There was not a cloud in the sky this night.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what I initially thought was a distant lightning strike as the entire skyline lit up enough to put the trees in silhouette.  But.... no thunder... I dismissed it, believing perhaps a distant power transformer had popped...even though the hue of the light was markedly blue.   Ten to fifteen minutes later, it happened again.  At this point i! dismissed it as some kind of visual distortion... it was late...perhaps i had my eyes open too long and glanced at the window and imagined the flash...and as I was looking out the window, it happened again. My cat started going berserk about this time.  Normally, he is lazy.  Suddenly he was all about chasing invisible things, and meowing incessently. This went on until approximately 3am, at seemingly irregular intervals.  I finally decided to get up, go outside with ALL of my house lights off and look to the sky to make sure I was actually seeing what I thought I was seeing.  I noticed that the dogs in the neighborhood were quite vocal, which is unusual. I was nearly finished with my cigarette, when *FLASH* it happened again.  I immediately activated the stop watch on my iphone to see if in fact the flashes were occurring at regular intervals or not...and, of course, not a single other flash happened after that... I did not see any *craft* per se, but this was bizarre... and after reading the post from thie person in Renton on the same night at the same time, I felt highly compelled to let them know that they were not alone in seeing this strangeness.   Renton is to the south of me, so it stands to reason we saw the same phenomenon.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Metallic reflecting object stayed around for an hour.;2017-05-27 10:30:00;1 hour;Metallic reflecting object stayed around for an hour. I was watching all the cotton flying around the sky and I noticed a glimmer.  I saw the object in the distance, and assumed it was a plane or some thing identifiable.  It faded away then started twikling again. It didn't move or float away and stayed there about an hour.  It appeared to twinkle like a metallic reflection every 30 seconds.  Kind of like a star in the day.  I grabbed some binoculars, but it was very shaky and hard to focus.  Seemed to be above the haze layer.  I was in Renton aiming in the direction of seattle. I am attaching a photo I took.  It looks just like the sky with nothing in it, but if you zoom in right in the middle of the pic, eventually you can see the black dot where it was.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Looking out West from my patio, I was watching a plane fly by, as this is a very popular route for planes coming from the west.  I managed to catch a glimpse of what looked like a satellite, moving across the sky from west to east, being illuminated by the son behind it, flickering on and off.  Very bright.  Moving just as fast as a satellite mind you.  About a minute went by and the craft seemed to stop high above me and just slowly dim out over the course of 10 minutes in one spot.  Slightly moving south at this point.  I've lost sight of the object as it seems to have just disappeared.  Didn't see it move for quite a while.

The noise lasted for a few minutes before vanishing.  It also returned briefly about 20 min later, with all the smoke in the air anything could be flying above rne, and I don’t know any plane that is that loud and takes that long to fly down, let alone the fact that the noise didn’t decrease in the slightest thought out the couple of min we heard it, a planes noise is loud but it goes by as a plane flys by, it doesn’t linger.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
