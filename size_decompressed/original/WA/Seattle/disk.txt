Weather conditions were clear with some light high clouds.   Size of craft was approx. 75 feet long and 10-15 feet wide.  Location:  Inverness neighborhood- North Seattle. After school, two friends and I witnessed a large, sleek saucer type UFO.  It was dull grey in color and exhibited a thin band of red pulsating light that traveled quickly around the center body of the craft.  It hovered approximately 1500-2000 feet off the ground and was not far away from our position.   The craft would remain stationary, then quickly traveled in an elliptical path of 100-125 yards only to return to its original position and again quietly hover in place.  It traveled in this pattern four times.   A Seattle Police helicopter flew into the area, and proceeded to engage the UFO.  As soon as the helicopter neared the craft, it silently sped off and was out of sight in seconds.

So the four possible dates would be 4/7, 4/14, 4/21,or 4/28.  I did not want to guess as which Friday the sighting occurred, so I left it as 4/00/1972.   I'm not sure why 1972 did not come out correctly? Next week, I plan to speak with my two friends and encourage them to report the sighting on the database as well.  Will they be required to fill out their names, address, etc?  (Even though the information is held in confidence, I think it will be problematic for them to complete that step).  Please advise.  Thank you Peter  Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
UFO Sighting in December 1978 in Seattle, WA.;1978-12-20 18:00:00;5-10 minutes;UFO Sighting in December 1978 in Seattle, WA. I was 10 years old at the time I saw this.  It was early evening and I was looking out the window.  I saw some lights that started rising up and I said, Oh my God, there's something out there! and my sister and mother rushed to the window to see.  It was shaped like two pie plates inverted together with lights around the edge of various colors and a red light on the top.  It had openings that looked almost like small, round windows that were between the lights on the edge.  The surface was smooth and metallic looking.  It just hovered above the ground without a sound for a few minutes and then took off straight up into the sky in the blink of an eye.  I don't think it was more than 50 yards from the house it was really close.  The really strange thing about it is that all of us have different memories of what we saw.  I remember my brother and uncle being there but neither of them remember it or think they were there.  My mother remembers it going over the house and then hovering and my sister remembers being outside and watching it go over the house, hover and then take off in the sky.  It seems like it was still a little light when I first saw it, but when it just took off straight up, it was dark. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

There were about 6 people with me, but they saw nothing.  I was at 92nd and Greenwood.  As I waited, I looked up at the sky.  I thought I saw a silver bird (seagull).  It was quite far away.  As it came closer, I realized it couldn't be a bird because it was too big.  It was shiny silver and flew slowly towards me.  Then 2 or more (can't remember) Army helicopters (had camophlage paint on them)came behind it.  The craft suddenly dived into some trees and the helicopters followed it.  The people with me were frozen (they didn't talk or move).  Suddenly I said, Did you see that?  One of them said what.  I said I think I just saw a UFO.  He said, Why didn't you tell us when it was here?. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
1980 Sighting with Memory Loss Seattle, Washington at Boeings & I-5;1980-06-10 05:30:00;unknown;1980 Sighting with Memory Loss Seattle, Washington at Boeings & I-5 It was 5:30 AM. My mother, son and I were traveling Southbound on I-5 on our way to pick up my brother to go fishing. I was driving and felt a very strong vibration traveling up my arms from holding the steering wheel. This vibration was so strong that I could feel it in my chest as well. There was no sound.  We were passing Boeings, which is a small, private airport for private and smaller commercial planes. I leaned forward to look up through the windsheild (I was driving an Oldsmomile that had a deep, slanted windshield and it was necessary to lean forward to view the sky).  I witnessed a large (about 1/2 the size of a football field) saucer shaped UFO. I remember it being a pewter color,a dull silver, rather than the shiny description I have since read about. There were running lights flashing on the underside of the craft - much like the chasing lights now available for Christmas Tree lights. I remember them being blue in color. The UFO was a little higher than the freeway street lights (VERY close) and almost directly above our vehichle.  I remember yelling out in shock and excitement, Mom, it's a UFO...Oh My God, it's a UFO!. I remember making the decision to pull over to the shoulder of the road. As I navigated over, I remember seeing 6 - 7 other cars parked on the shoulder of the opposite side of the freeway - they would be heading Northbound. I do not recall seeing anyone in or near-by their vehichles. I do not remember seeing any cars on either the freeway or on the shoulder of our side of the freeway - Southbound.  This memory was lost for 3 years!  One day, I was doing a mindless task - dusting furniture - and recalled the sighting. It was in Technocolor and VERY clear...only 3 years later! I called my mother, who was living in Alaska and asked When we were going to pick up my brother to go fishing 3 years previous...what did we see? Her answer was instantanious, A UFO. I asked if she'd recalled this or had told anyone about it previous to my call. Her answer was No.  Neither my mother nor I are the type of people to keep this memory a secret. we would have told close friends and family members. We didn't. We couldn't! We had had our memories blocked somehow.  When I recalled the sighting, my memorie goes from seeing the UFO to being in a rented rowboat at in Point Defiance Sound (located in Tacoma, Washington), our fishing destination. We were caught in a rip-tide and I recall all 4 of us having to lay flat in the boat to avoid being tossed into the sound by the extreme bobbing of the boat encountered in this rip-tide.  After my mother and I discussed this incident, I called my brother and asked him if he could remember if my mother, son and myself were late in arriving for our fishing date. He couldn't recall, as it had been 3 full years after this trip.  Neither my mother nor I recall seeing anything other than the UFO. I am filing this report in the hope that one of passengers of the other 6-7 cars may have a clearer memory of the encounter and wish to report this for the record.

Disk with 7 red lights moving like a wheel;1986-08-15 22:00:00;1 minute;Disk with 7 red lights moving like a wheel This object passed directly over me, heading east. It was clearly visible for about one minute. It had 7 red lights in a circular formation. The lights were equally spaced from each other near the edge of the disk and recessed into something solid. The surface of the disk was not visible. I could see the stars in the sky behind the object but I could also clearly see that the lights were recessed in a solid surface. There was no reflection on any surface of the lights. The disk was turned on it's side with the axis (going through the middle of the disk) parallel to the ground.  The disk moved exactly like a wheel being pushed across the ground because as the disk rotated at the same speed as the object moved forward. It also maintained a constant height above the ground, moving up as it approached and cleared a hill and then down as it went down the other side of the hill.  The speed of the object was 5 or 6 MPH. The size was at least 60 feet across (from one edge of the disk to the other). The altitude was at least 60 feet. It easily cleared a group of 40-50 foot tall trees.  I describe it as a disk because that is all I could see of it but it might also have been a cylinder and I could only see one end of it.  There was absolutely no sound from the object and there was no visible exhaust or disturbance of the air.  I have seen all manner of man made aircraft in the Seattle area from military helicopters to stealth and B1-B bombers. While I don't know the origin of the object I can say it had none of the chracteristics of any man made craft I have ever seen or heard of.  My career is in software development.

Disk hovered over highway;1998-09-19 21:00:00;15 min;Disk hovered over highway We were driving on a street near I-5 when we saw flashes in the sky. We looked up and saw that they were car headlights reflecting off the surface of a craft that couldn't have been more than 50 feet over the highway. It had 6 or 7 points of white light around the outside, and very bright red and yellow ones in the center. Occasionally jerked back and forth from one side of the highway to the other.

The disk seemed to be round but would at times appear flat as well, no larger than a nickel held at arms length, but still under the clouds. My wife and I were eating our customary lunch on the road after purchasing the food from Maruta, a Japanese grocery in the George town district.  We sat on a curb between Maruta and a Seafirst Bank, next to an on Ramp for I-5 a routine we've gone through several times in the past. One of the attractions ofcourse is the planes landing at King County Airport. After most of the meal I was looking up at the sky watching another plane come in when I noticed a dust spot on a cloud.  I kept watching it to figure out what it was.  Not being able to determine it, I asked my wife what she thought. She insisted it was a bird, but after careful scrutiny, realized it was round and had no movement as a bird might make, such as wings.  Also, at this point we had been watching it a couple of minutes and it was moving in a straight line, no doubts.  No bird can move that straight. We discussed wether or not it was a plane, of which there was one in the sky to compare with and decided no. Aside from the shape, there was absolutely no sound emanating from the object.  A balloon, maybe, but at times it seemed flat and not round, as if it were a CD slowly spinning.  LET ME POINT OUT THAT THIS ANALAGY IS NOT ACCURATE< IT IN NO WAY SEEMED LIKE A SPINNING OBJECT. That merely describes the transition between the round appearance and the flat. While watching, it appeared once my eyes adjusted to the sky's light, that the disk was not black as first appeared but rather a charcoal grey, my wife however maintains that it was black. As it slowly moved towards a cloud, one with shape, not the usual cloudy Seattle sky, I started telling my wife it was a UFO.  She kept saying no, there is some explanation and was remaining very calm. I however was trying to get her to follow the UFO as it was moving by us. She threw away our trash, and started the car, we headed West on Bailey from Maruta's parking lot, the North on Corson Ave, but saw nothing, it was gone. I spent the next fifteen minutes trying to determine the time and direction of the sighting since we had neither a watch or map with us.  I think the information given here is accurate and correct.  Please call me for any other info you may need.  I will be checking the web sight regularly for further occurances by others. Thank you, ((name deleted))r;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I saw a very large, brilliant white disc falling in a diagonal trajectory that disappeared behind a hill  in the distance. The sighting was of extremely short duration. The disc appeared to be as large or larger than a full moon appears in the sky yet of very similar color to a full bright moon. I called out to my companion who was just getting in the car with her back turned to the object. She turned to look but the object had disappeared. I called a local Seattle radio station to report the sighting and to ask if anyone else had reported it as well. They told me that no one else had reported it. I was quite surprised due to the size and brightness of the object. I am a real estate broker in the greater Seattle area with 26 years experience here. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A very bright object passed between the trees very fast with no sound.;2000-04-28 22:05:00;10 sec.;A very bright object passed between the trees very fast with no sound. I was sitting outside on a clear night a little after 10pm.  I glanced up and saw the brightest object I've ever seen speed by between two tall trees.  It was not high in the sky, like a falling star.  Planes fly over all the time so I have an idea of the size of aircraft related to distance and sound.   This object was well within the atmosphere and made no noise!  It was definitely going faster than the speed of sound but no sound followed.  There was no tail of light.  I don't believe it was a meteor or it would have landed on the houses nearby.  It was going in a horizontal position in the sky.   It was very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  I, together with a co-investigator, conducted an in-depth, on-site interview of the witness, and we consider both the witness, and the information she provided, to be highly reliable.  Subsequent analysis of the data, combined with information provided by other witnesses at different locations, indicates that the object probably was traveling at approximately 2,000 miles per hour, and was at an altitude of approximately 2,000-3,000 feet above ground level.

Shiny saucer shaped vehicle over downtown Seattle displayed various speeds and altitude accelerations.;2002-05-05 15:45:00;20 minutes;Shiny saucer shaped vehicle over downtown Seattle displayed various speeds and altitude accelerations. At approximately 15:45 I saw something shiny in the corner of my eye as I was eating lunch on the 18th floor of a downtown building.  I was looking south toward Safeco Field when I realized that what I was seeing was NOT a plane.  It looked like a tin can in the wind, except it looked in control and it varied in speed.  Also, it hovered like a helicopter at times.  It was black on top and very shiny (almost like a mirror) on the bottom.  At first I thought it might be the stealth fighter, but I don't remember the stealth being able to manuever quite like this vehicle.  Once it got to West Seattle, it shot up straight (from approx. 5,000 ft. to at least 35,000).  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It was NOT a plane, nor the stealth, nor some weather balloon.  This thing then zigzagged and must have flipped backwards.  It then shot up again, probably another 5-10,000 ft.  I could see it's black speck hovering for about 10 minutes.  Then it just followed the cloud format! ions back towards downtown Seattle heading east, very slow. I'm a student at the UW and a runner who doesn't take drugs or make stuff up.  In fact, I'd say I'm a good citizen who strives to better not only my life but the lives of others as well.  What I saw was incredible and exiting, but very unexplainable and a bit scary too.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

It moved very slowly upwards and southwesterly. I don't know of any manmade craft that can fly so slowly. Even a balloon would rise more rapidly. When I ran to get the camera my daughter saw it give off a whitish light. By time I got back it was higher in the sky and I took six pictures. I don't know why but there is not even a black dot on any of the images. Nothing showed up. We watched it until we lost sight of it because it got too high, 8:30 to 8:40.

My wife asked me to go outside and observe stationery lights due north of our yard on Capitol Hill in Seattle in the direction of Mt Baker. The row of lights were of difference colors and were not quite horizonal to the ground. The lights appeared to be some distance, we could not judge distance or the size of the object. I appeared to be large. We had a high powered telescope, but could not get it work properly. We also had binoculers which worked fine. We observed a red light break away from the row of lights. We also saw a faint whitish beam come off now and then from the end of the lowest part of the object. Our house is near the flight path of SeaTac Airport and commercial planes came between us and the object. The weather conditions were terrable. It was raining and the wind was blowing at 10 to 20 miles an hour. Since I could not focus on the object with the telescope, we finally went inside.

About halfway across the lake it shifted and started flying towards queen anne hill.   Once over the hill it started to fly towards the city once again unitl it turned west and flew out over the water and out of sight.   I first thought it may be a group of balloons that had gotten loose but quickly realized that was no possible as the object was spinning at a constant rate too fast to be balloons.

I was, and still try to be a skeptic.  I study science and specialize in mental health.  However, while driving along Interstate-5 near Seattle, I saw something I could not explain very well but will do my best now.  It was a craft in the sky that appeared on a side view at first, as a black slit, not moving, then panned towards me revealing its disk shape and the top of the craft.  From this view it was shiny and light in color, but opaque like glow-in- the-dark material that is not glowing.  It then veered to the left and flew back up vertically, seeming to be sucked into the clouds.   After this, a small monoplane flew by in the area traveling east. Then a commercial jet flew nearby traveling northwest.  This gave me scale and relative perspective to the craft.  When the craft disappeared, it was as if it was fleeing from sight of the two planes that would soon come into view.  I then looked to the car next to me and noticed a man in a BMW also looking up at the area in the sky talking on a cell phone.  It appeared that other drivers were looking up as well.

It was bright white in color and as it got closer we noticed it slowly turned and seemed like a sphere and was changing color from white to a silverish black in one section of whatever it was and then white again.  We both commented that it looked to have been spinning.

Actually, this thing is like a ‘flaw’ to me in my photos and is an inconvenience to me.  I’d like to know if this is a plane (but I heard nothing).  Here is another part of this that is really strange?  One of my last frames showing the UFO at the end of this minute there is another light to the far right of my frame on one photo, a really bright light that is round in the sky.   I am going to assume that is a plane?  Why?  I didn’t know that planes are able to fly over the port area of Seattle like that?   I’ve no scratch or dust on my lens as I took a couple hundred photos in my camera with no patterned mark like this.  Also, this thing is moving in each shot.  Do you have any idea if this is an anomaly or an actual UFO?;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
