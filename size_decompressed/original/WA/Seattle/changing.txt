Low flying Orange Blimp over Lake Washington (Seattle, Madrona Park Beach);1987-04-24 20:15:00;20 minutes;Low flying Orange Blimp over Lake Washington (Seattle, Madrona Park Beach) I can confirm a report on your website dated 4/23/1987.  The actual date was Friday April 24, 1987. Approxiamately 8:15pm.  Located at Seattleâ€™s Madrona Park Beach with a friend, I saw a large blimp object that was glowing orange and yellow in color. It rose from the trees behind us. The object was about 50-100 feet long and stayed just above tree level. The object was silent but periodically made a low pitched sound (like a low growling noise).  It slowly floated from the trees and stopped in front us. The object hovered above Lake Washington for 10-15 minutes and drifted across the lake (east towards the city of Bellevue).  It looked like a blimp, but the core of the object looked fluid (like yellow orange and red lava).  There was a reddish black square that hung just below the object. The object was so close, that it produced an orange hue over all of us.  I also felt static electricity. The object slowly changed shape and orientation.  At one point, it looked as the object was tearing into the sky itself (its hard to explain). There were many witnesses at the park at that time including a Metro bus driver on the #2 route.  Even boats in the water stopped to look at it.   I was 16 at the time, and I will never forget.  Whatever it was, it did not seem to be friendly.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I was walking the dog in my residential neighborhood and saw a black circle flying low directly overhead. As I watched, it rolled over or changed shape to a disc and then back to a circle. It continued rolling in this way and moving northward until I lost sight of it over my home.It was about one or two minutes. It seemed to me to be maybe 6 feet in diameter.

I had been lighting off some fireworks for my nieces and nephews and when we were done we began to clean up some of the trash. That's when my grandma,my uncle's girlfriend,my girlfriend and I had noticed an oval shaped craft which appeared to be a snowy white with a soft blue center. it seemed to be moving fairly slow.(north bound)when to our surprise it changed shape and color.it turned into a circular or sphere shape and it's color an orange or brick.it didnt stop there though,it had stayed a solid color for a few seconds then began to blink and then just disappeared.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

It wasn't a balloon.  It morphed from a dark, circular object to a brilliant, luminous, silvery rod-shape a few times.  It slowly moved from it's position south of me to directly over my head.  It followed me for about five minutes of my walk, staying perfectly over my head.  It slowly, almost casually moved to the north during the next five to ten minutes.  Then it simply disappeared.  Two things of note:  When it morphed into the silvery rod shape, it shined with an intense silver light, almost like looking into the sun.  More perplexing was when it was the black, circular shape that followed me.  It didn't look like anything physical.  It literally looked like a hole had been punched through the sky and into the darkest depths of outer space. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Bright flying object over the puget sound;2008-01-01 17:15:00;1 minute 15 sec;Bright flying object over the puget sound We were taking time lapse photos overlooking Elliot Bay towards the Olympics and after stitching together the photos, we noticed this bright object that flew in and out of the frame within a one minute time period. As we took a closer look at the images, the bright object started as a flat shaped object with multiple lights along the side then as it flew closer towards the camera, it shifted shapes and became very bright casting a reflection on the water. The object appeared out of the clouds then flew straight for 30 seconds then dove down and then back up out of the frame within no more than one minute.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

PDT, I witnessed a strange glowing object appear from out of the thick cloud covered sky and literally drop vertically, it disappeared from my point of view.  I was looking out of my window, located on the fourth floor in condo building facing north to the city.  The object appeared out of the clouds and was at first extremely bright round in shape then it turned fire engine red, the object became elongated turning into more of a rectangle The object then morphed and an extended a long ladder like formation underneath of it.  Its size in relationship to a fully visible sun appeared to be at least 3 suns.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Sighting through photographs;2008-07-07 20:07:00;20-30 minutes;Sighting through photographs The first thing I should say is that this craft was not visible by the naked eye.  I was taking photographs on 7/7/08 at approximately 8:07pm of the view from my balcony. The sun was just going down and the moon was visible at one end of the sky and the sun setting behind some mountains on the other side. There was not a cloud in the sky. It was still light out (sea blue sky). After taking the initial photo I checked it in the review screen (digital camera)and saw that there was an object in the picture that did not appear to have been in the sky at the time I took the picture, or afterwards, when I checked the sky.  I took 4 more photos and the craft is present in 3 of the shots. In the remaining 2 there is a cloud that seems to have absorbed the craft. Upon enlarging the photos and examining the details, I found that this almost perfectly circular cloud was present to the lower right of the craft in all of the photos that had the craft in them.  Upon examining the photos in the order they were taken, in the first three, the craft seems to have moved in a v pattern in the sky. Then in the fourth the cloud becomes prominent and the craft is gone. This is more evident in the fifth shot, where the cloud is seen very prominently at the top of the photo as if it was rising upwards.  The following night I took more photographs of the same area and although I did in fact capture this cloud once again, the same craft does not appear to have been present at that time. Although two smaller objects, that were present in the 7/7/08 shots, were in fact visible and were photographed on this day as well. I did visibly see in the sky, which did not move in conjunction with regular star patterns.  Upon enlargement of the 7/7/08 photos, what may be the most clear view of an unknown craft can be seen. It appears to have changed its alignment in all three photos. In one it appears to be two diamond shaped objects that are connected at some center point. There is a light on each side (almost as if a flame exhaust) that obscures detail of the craft and it is a brilliant white in the center with a almost electric blue peaking at the top and at the bottom.  In the second photograph, the vessel is more prominent and appears to be more like two Isosceles triangles on the sides connected by a tube or cone like center. The lighting on the craft is more of a greenish white on both sides at what would be the base of the triangles, which escalates into a definite electric blue at the tips. the center seems to be reflecting the light from the sides. the final photo (which is actually the second) gives the clearest view of all. It would appear to be two side propulsion elements attached to a main structure in the center. The sides appear to be shaped like the front of a clothes iron with the exact detail of the center is definitely rounded in some way, but is obscured somewhat by the light emanating from the sides. The entire craft has a green glow to it, that seems to come from two dome like elements atop the side structures. They glow the color of a green GE party bulband have an electric blue aura above them. i would like to include a website where the pictures have been posted as well as a video I am in the process of making with closeup shots of the craft, however to keep anonymity, I obviously can not. I will check this site more closely to see if there is some way I can link the site to this site or have the link posted.  I have over 1000 photographs of the same area and am diligently examining all them ( I have already found additional images that may contain a similar, or the same object and/or its lighting track.) This is absolutely not lens glare a reflective surface or any other such camera tricks that are frequently attributed to such photos. The photos were all taken at 100 ISO which would have required the objects to be remaining relatively still (or moving very slow) due to the shutter speed. Photographs of airplanes moving through the air taken at this setting, will appear as a streak of light in the sky.  I have your e-mail and will submit some photos to add to this report after they have been properly processed.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Static object observed in clear skies in high commercial air traffic area.;2008-07-11 17:30:00;4 minutes;Static object observed in clear skies in high commercial air traffic area. On 07-11-08/ 1730 hours, two adults witnessed an unidentified object near the 7300 block West Seattle.  The object was described as being directly overhead.  Weather conditions were very clear, estimated tempature was low 70's.  Witnesses reported a light wind from the southwest.  Due to the clarity of the skies, witnesses had difficulty in determining scale and altitude. It was estimated to be about the size of a quarter coin when compared against a human hand held up in comparison. The witnesses were quite certain that the object remained motionless for several minutes, as if hovering.  During the event, they saw what appeared to be a commercial airliner flying near the object at a much higher altitiude. The object was a third smaller than the aircraft as it transited the area. The object displayed no movement, appeared to be light colored, with a haze around it. The object reportedly changed from round to a tubular or cigar shape.  No noise could be associated with the object.  Witnesses appeared to be credible, lucid and sober. This area is very populated with commercial aircraft.

I witnessed a star like shape that was 3x brighter than Venus. I was out to my patio after hearing a number of fireworks. After looking at the fireworks I gazed at the skyline looking east and little south at about 30 degrees off the horizon. The object was not moving. I went inside to grab my field glasses. After looking for several minutes and not finding them I went back to observing. The object had moved slightly. It was in the direction of the city of Bellevue WA. I face Lake Washington, living in the Sand Point area. Watching for another several minutes the object started to fade in strength and dim to a red color. Then it disappeared altogether for 10 seconds, returning to full strength again. This pattern repeated  three times, moving slightly on the horizon in south direction. Cloud cover stopped my observation.  Total time of event was 30 minutes. 11:25 pm to 11:55pm 07/22/09.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Reddish orange lights seen above fireworks display location minutes before the show was to begin in Seattle on July 4th, 2014.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;~5 minutes;Reddish orange lights seen above fireworks display location minutes before the show was to begin in Seattle on July 4th, 2014. Just a few minutes prior to our city fireworks display was to begin over Lake Union, northeast of the Space Needle I noticed an unusual reddish changing to orange light that was far brighter than the usual aircraft in the sky.  I could also see that it was hovering. I zoomed in with my binoculars and I could see three lights - red, yellow and orange. The lights were flashing from right to left.  They also had a luminescence not typical for the usual aircraft I might see in the sky.  I had seen several helicopters overhead so I suspected I could be mistaking this hovering craft.  Once zoomed in through my binoculars it did not look like a helicopter.  I could see the outline of the helicopters when zoomed in on them. I was not able to see any detail aside from the lights on this craft.  I ran to grab my camera and zoomed in to capture it as the light turned southward and vanished instantly. The following morning my thirteen year old son returned home from spending the night with friends and wanted to show me some unusual photos he had taken while situated to watch the fireworks. He had been on the west side of the city, on top of a hillside looking down toward the lake, and had a straight on view of these strange lights in the sky. From his vantage point there were three of these bright lights forming a triangle shape, without any lines or visible material in between these lights. He snapped two very clear photographs of the lights. He noticed they moved formation, not remaining in this triangle shape before they all disappeared. I posted these photos to my Facebook page on July 5th. The only comment made in response was from his Aunt who was at yet another part of the city, closer down toward the lake from where he and I both were during this time. She had also seen these lights and suspected they were of UFO nature. (I have seen on one other UFO reporting sight as of today, July 6th, 2014 - there has been one other report of this sighting in Seattle.  It sounds like he was on the same hill as my son and reported a very similar description.);47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
North Seattle late morning Orb pulsing different colors;2017-08-15 11:00:00;50 seconds;North Seattle late morning Orb pulsing different colors It was just after walking with my girlfriend to the bus stop.  She needed to go further into the city for the day, so after that I walked to the nearby store to get something to snack on, and after that I wanted to walk my dog on nearby city trial.   I had just started the trial, I had a feeling to look up and notice what to me appear to be a ball of light getting closer.  I thought maybe it's just a plane flying by, and I was wrong, this was a pulsating Orb, it was changing colors from violet, to green and white.  So I was to capture 50 seconds of film from my iPhone 6.  Notice from the film, the Orb would disappear in some parts of the clip and negative photos show that the UFO is solid.  When the object disappeared and reappear in frame.   I notice I was the only person on the trail.  It felt strange to witness something alone, and not to have another opinion or experience.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
