Metal triangle seen over Boeing field in 1980.;1980-04-05 00:00:00;3 minutes;Metal triangle seen over Boeing field in 1980. During the first week of April 1980 I saw at 2am a black triangle hovering over the north end of Boeing field near Georgetown just south of Seattle Washington. I was driving in my car on I-5 when I saw what appeared to be a craft as large as a jet fighter with heavy metal struts and no lights on floating soundlessly about 200 feet in the air.  I wanted to stop and observe it but it was as if emanations of fear surrounded the craft.  It seems emanations of forgetfulness also came off the machine because I forgot about it until two weeks later when a small article in the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported that a triangular craft was spotted by several people near the Boeing plant between Edmonds and Everett.  It seemed to me that either Boeing had developed an antigravity device or had a balloon that looked like it was made of metal or that Boeing was being observed by some sort of an alien craft. After 24 years I still have no answers to these questions. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Triangular object in the sky with movement in the blink of an eye.;1982-06-15 02:30:00;10 minutes;Triangular object in the sky with movement in the blink of an eye. It was in the middle of the night.  I couldn't sleep and got up.  I went to the front door (which had a window in the top of it) to look outside at the neighboring houses.  We watched each other's houses to prevent crime.  I don't remember the date, or even the year.  I thought it was perhaps in the summer time because it was clear outside.  I was looking at the surrounding houses and happened to look up in the sky.  I was looking between two neighbor's houses.  In the sky I saw a triangle of 3 red lights.  The triangle seemed to remain in place for a period of time.  Then, in the blink of an eye, it moved from one place to another.  It didn't drift from one place to another like a balloon or a plane would do.  The lights weren't like an airplane's lights.  I came to the conclusion that it might be a UFO since I couldn't associate the lights or the movement with anything that I've seen here.  I've not seen anything else like it since.  This was my first experience with such a sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Saw a triangular light formation on an aerial object with a light pulsing in the middle pass directly overhead on the Puget Sound;1987-07-22 10:15:00;about 2 minutes;Saw a triangular light formation on an aerial object with a light pulsing in the middle pass directly overhead on the Puget Sound The sighting took place in Washington state on a state ferry going from Vashon Island to Fauntleroy in West Seattle. THe sighting took place at about 10:15PM on Thursday, July 8th. About 30 minutes before the sighting, waiting in line in the car for the ferry, I noticed a helicopter moving in from the NE to the SE. I saw it and then it moved behind us and I could hear it for some time. A little bit later I was on the ferry in the car, which was parked at the very front of the ferry. I saw one helicopter who had 5 or so uncolored lights on. I also saw another object, that I could not discern as a helicopter or plane. It was too far away for me to tell its shape, but I could tell it was pointed. I thought it might be a small airplane. The unidentified object was directly in front of the ferry, and the helicopter was a ways to the left, moving to circle the area. The helicopter and unidentified object appeared to be at about the same height, and around the same speed, though the helicopter was farther away (I am terrible at estimating distances and altitude and speed.) The helicopter's lights, after a few seconds, changed to one uncolored light and one red/blue light (it appeared to be two lights cloase to each other, but I am nto sure) that alternated in blinking between uncolored and red/blue. This was the lighting all helicopters I saw from that point on were using. The unidentified object remained the same in terms of lighting. I looked at the object closely, as it passed directly over the ferry. I saw that the lights were all uncolored, shaped in an equilateral triangle, with one light in the center appearing to pulsate. I saw this from directly under the object as it passed over the ferry. Then the object mobed behind us and the ferry itself obstructed my ability to see it. The helicopter also moved out of sight as it moved to the left of the ferry where I was unable to see it. However, a few minutes later one helicopter came over the hill directly in front of me, and another came in! from the right where it had been invisible to me before due to the ferry obstructing my vision. I estimate that in all there were 3 or 4, possibly even 5 helicopters that appeared to be circling the area around Vashon Island. The craft I saw did not exhibit physically remarkable flight characteristics, except possibly for air-speed which I am not capable of effectively judging and so have no idea. The craft simply moved in a straight line and maintained the same speed and altitude. Like I said I guess it was traveling a little faster than the helicopters in the area, but it is hard for me to tell. Once I got off the ferry I saw another helicopter which was likely one of the ones I had seen earlier coming around in the circle. As surprising as it may sound I did not attempt to look back across the water at the object and choppers after I got off the ferry. I am not certain why.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

It caught my eye as a blur, but as it flew almost overhead it looked solid as it left our position it became a blur again--like camoflage. We were entering our backyard. As it entered our line of vision in the south, and left it in the north it was just a narrow band of orange light as if it had camoflage but while over our yard and the neighbor's yards it was clear, blocked out the light of the stars, silent and steady. The six round, pale orange lights were all the same size and close together, perfectly equidistant from one another: one at the narrow end of the tri- angle, two in the next row, and three across the broad end of course, the narrow end was the leading edge. It did not seem to become a blur in the north until it was about a mile beyond us going north: it did not disappear so much as blend slowly into the appearance of space.

Orange triangular object, very distant, very slow, binocular brightness.;1996-08-10 22:45:00;10 minutes;Orange triangular object, very distant, very slow, binocular brightness. I was scanning the south sky in constellation Sagittarius with 10x binoculars Jupiter was in the area and I could see three of its moons as well.  The planet was directly north of globular cluster M22 with about 1.5 degree separation.  I spotted something that should not have been there, a small red-orange light traveling leisurely westward halfway between Jupiter and the cluster. Upon closer examination, I discerned that it was triangular shaped, about fourth magnitude, and flickering slightly.  I watched it for about ten minutes, and in that time it proceeded west into Scorpius and brightened by about one magnitude.  It was about 20 degrees above the horizon, and moved very slowly. I got the impression that it was at a great height. After ten minutes, my arms became fatigued from holding the heavy pair of binoculars.  I put them down for a few seconds. When I resumed looking, I could not relocate the object.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

Saw triangle craft, news report says space junk, not from my angle.;1997-06-15 21:00:00;1 min;Saw triangle craft, news report says space junk, not from my angle. My wife and I were driving north on 15th Ave Ne near Northgate Mall when she called my attention to a triangle pattern of three white lights, one at each corner, not far above us, maybe 200 yards in a diagonal line of sight. It was clear the lights were part of one solid object although it was too far to make out any details of the craft. I had been living in the Seattle area for all of my 28+ years at the time including living next to the Renton airport for several years. I have seen many types of aircraft from commercial to fighter planes and this looked nothing like anything I had seen before. The sunroof  was open when she let out what I would guess is the usual reaction: “what the!”. I am one who looks for a logical explanation when confronted with something I can’t immediately explain and figured at first glance it was a stealth fighter. I had seen one at about the same distance but I immediately realized that there was no sound. Stealth technology may make these planes almost invisible on radar but when I saw one it was far from silent. Also, there were only the three white lights. No red and blue warning lights that you see on a typical airplane. We both had a very eerie feeling as we couldn’t make sense of it. When we got home that night we saw on the news that “strange lights” were seen in the Seattle area that night and were dismissed as space debris from a falling satellite that crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Ok, a plausible explanation except we were heading north and the object was heading from west to east at that point, and that’s a really long way to get to the Pacific.  I can’t imagine space debris is capable of changing direction. I have since seen footage of an old Russian satellite that fell out of orbit a few years back and was filmed by a fishing boat crew as it came down and burned up in the atmosphere. It looked nothing like what we saw. Three lights in a triangular pattern that appeared to be one object, flying low and slow with no running noise. I am one who p! refers t o go from A to B instead of A to Alien but what we saw was very similar to video footage I have seen on tv of  triangle shaped objects with three or more lights on the bottom.. The lights were evenly spaced and were moving very slowly, but being one who prefers a rational explanation,I probably would have accepted the news explanation and forgotten about it. The fact they said it landed in the Pacific when what we saw it CLEARLY heading east has always bothered me, that and I am 99.9% sure what I saw was not space debris. I have searched a couple of databases (yours and MUFON) but haven’t seen anything else that sounds like what we saw. Enough people saw it that it was mentioned on the news but I cant find any other reports. I am not sure what year it was, only that it was between 1995 and 1998.

Baker area. At 11:45PM I was returning from a visit and driving along Lake Washington Blvd. headed north. I was about a mile south of the Pits when I looked up to the left and saw a slowly moving huge triangular craft with a white unblinking light in each apex and a red light centered in the middle slowly pulsing. The white lights illuminated the bottom of the craft which reflected a light grey triangular shape against the dark sky. The craft was clearly triangular. The craft was heading slightly east of north so I was expecting to be directly underneath it when I rounded the bend to the Pits, but instead, the craft was now seen to be heading hard west of north. It was so low that it disapeared over the small hill west and parallel to the Blvd. I went up over Mt. Baker and then Capital hill to try and catch it in the distance, but there were no objects-airplane or other-flying west or north west where it should have been. As an oddity, before I lost sight of it,  I saw one horizontal dim white light beam cross over and above me in a west-east direction on two occasions just before it disapeared over the hill.  This may or may not have been associated with the craft.  My first impression was that  I had been shot at with something and I jumped in the way someone would jump if you threw something at them, then I realized that the streak going overhead was a beam of light.  I grew up in the area-I have never seen a triangular craft before. I have no idea what kind of plane is like this!;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

The two of us, a lawyer and a software engineer, observed three glowing triangles zoom across the sky (east to west) from one horizon to the other.  The objects moved quickly.  My best guess is that they took 15 seconds to move across the sky. During this time, they moved in a straight line, leaving no trails, and stayed in perfect formation.  The objects were colored, as best I can recall, light yellow.  They moved silently.  After they had disappeared, I checked the time on my computer (it's synced up with GMT) and it was 2:51 am pacific daylight time.

Sparkling contrails in triangle pattern.;2000-10-25 20:30:00;45 minutes;Sparkling contrails in triangle pattern. My husband and I were up on our roof having a smoke when a strobe light caught our eyes. A few seconds later, we saw several faint stobes coming from a single point in the sky. At first we thought it might have been klieg lights, but it became obvious that these beams of light were not originating from the ground. They all came from within a single point up in the sky.  While staring up, we also saw three contrails (not sure they were actually contrails, but that is what they looked like) that formed a PERFECT triangular shape - even stranger, the contrails appeared to be sparkling as though they were electrically charged.  There were light clouds in the sky that formed an almost perfect circle around the perimeter of the sparkling triangle, and they were distorted as though heat waves were emanating through them. The size of this circle was about 3 or 4 city blocks. At this point, I became very frightened and ran downstairs to call the UFO hotline. I went back upstairs about 20 minutes later and the sparkling contrails were still there and still shaped like a perfect triangle, but the clouds were gone. We took a picture with a digital camera, but sadly, nothing showed up in the photo.  After about 10 minutes, the whole thing disappeared.  We were perfectly sober when we made this observation.  We are still trying to speculate what we may have seen - military camouflage technology? weather techology? I would be interested in knowing if others saw it.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I have done an MS Paint document of his recollection of the wing that I am attaching. Again, it is my re-draw of a small sketch he made as he was running out the door. I recall big, round lights, while he recalls trapezium-shaped lights and wings. I recall the round lights, as I said, and drew the wings as round, although I'm not sure they too were. They were definitely not pointed, we both recall (the corners were blunt or rounded). There were no lights on the aircraft other than the three point lights. We think the aircraft was black, but the sky was very dark. We could see the outline of the aircraft clearly. It appeared to be much lower than cruising altitude and appeared large compared to the stars, but not noticeably larger than any aircraft I am aware of (in other words, its size did not stand out). We live close to Boeing field and somewhat near the approach to SeaTac, so we have become accustomed to the altitudes planes are typically at as they pass by our home, whether taking off or landing.  Thank you. -((name deleted)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Regarding the lights, they were not blinking. They were a dim orange. The stars were white and extremely bright compared to the three lights on the aircraft. They were noticeably dimmer and more matte, if that word makes sense in this context. It was kind of a glow, but without illumination. ((END ADDENDA));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Triangular Ships Sighted in 4th of July skies over Seattle, WA.;2003-07-04 22:00:00;15 minutes;Triangular Ships Sighted in 4th of July skies over Seattle, WA. This sighting occured during the fireworks launched over the city of Seattle. I was staying at the Best Bestern (sic--Best Western/University Towers) Hotel in the University District of Seattle, WA. I was looking out of my hotel room enjoying the 4th of July Fireworks. My girlfriend had a room just above me on the next floor. I called her up to tell her what a great view we had of the fireworks. As I looked out the hotel window enjoying the multitude of shows (there were about 3 different ones going on) I looked on another part of the skyline where there were no fireworks but rather 4 triangular ships that seemed to be doing an acrobatic maneuver. First they simultaneously shot out in directions: North, East, South, and West and then they returned back to the original positions. They were not behaving like fireworks, I never saw fireworks act like this. Rather than think they were UFO's, I originally reasoned that they were miniature models of UFO's that someone had rigged up a radio control mechanism to. I called up my girlfriend that night to see if she could see them. Unfortunately she could not. I now believe that these objects were the same type that were viewed in Phoenix, Arizona on March 13, 1997 documented in Chuck Missler/Mark Eastman's book, Alien Encounters. I bought this book because of the sightings I had observed this July. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed aircraft, which perform aerobatic displays just prior to the fireworks display over downtown Seattle and Lake Union.

Telephoned Report:  At 23:55 hrs. on Sunday night, June 20, 2004, NUFORC received a telephone call from an adult male, located in the University District of Seattle, reporting that he allegedly had just been witness, thirty minutes earlier, to a dramatic sighting of a very anomalous-looking object in the clear skies above Seattle.  The individual reported that he was visiting from his home state of Idaho, in order to drop his daughter off for classes at the University of Washington.  He was standing outside at approximately 23:15 hrs., when his attention was suddenly drawn to a very bizarre looking, triangular shaped object in the night sky.  It immediately captured his attention, not only because of its bizarre appearance, but because of the amount of the night sky that it covered in the approximately 2 seconds that he was witness to the object.  The witness estimated that the object traversed an arc of approximately 90 degrees in those two seconds, and it was totally silent.  The witness added that the object did not have the normal red and green navigation lights, required on conventional aircraft during flight at night.  Moreover, he stated that the edges of the triangle appeared to be dark, and the center portion of the triangle appeared to him to be empty, or more lightly colored than the periphery.  The witness estimated that the apparent size of the object, from his vantage point, was three-quarters the size of the Moon.  Atmospheric conditions at the time were clear, and visibility unlimited (CAVU), with no clouds visible.  NUFORC is awaiting a written report from the witness.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report written by Peter Davenport, based on the telephone conversation with the witness on June 20, 2004.

I witnessed it for about 3 seconds, then it went behind the house and I lost contact. It was triangular in shape with a black leading edge, and lighter gray color inboard, with dim white lights at each corner of the lighter gray surface, I don,t know whats its elavation was, but I could see very good detail, about the size of 3/4 full moon. This machine was mechanically and materially beautiful, I have seen up close and in flight all kinds of aircraft,F-14s,F-15 eagles,F-16 falcons,B-1s,B-2s, B-52s, B-58 hustlers,SR-71s, but this craft sent chills up my spine,because of its triangular shape , mechanical and composite beauty. I do believe this is very similar to the Belgium sightings in the 1990's that I have seen and read about. I new what it was the second I saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report about same sighting, from same source.  We met with the individual, and found him to be exceptionally credible.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Four lights of yellow-orange color which was in a  triangular form that made no noise flying in the SW direction.;2004-07-30 22:50:00;10-15 seconds;Four lights of yellow-orange color which was in a  triangular form that made no noise flying in the SW direction. There were four lights.  One was on the left side and three on the right side, kind of in a lopsided form.  It moved fairly quickly and had no noise.  It was in the Western portion of the sky, but was more upward than closer down.  The lights were a orange-yellow that appeared blurry.  It vanished quickly as it headed south.  .                        (It was moving in this direction <-- .) . .  (This is the positon of the lights.);47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Black Triangle over Lake Washington;2004-09-18 19:45:00;1-2 minutes;Black Triangle over Lake Washington I pulled up in front of my home in Leschi and saw unusual lights over the I-90 Floating Bridge.  Getting out of my car, I got out my binoculars (I keep them in my car) and observed the craft as it headed north over Lake Washington, finally disappearing behind some trees.  What initially attracted my attention was the triangular configuration of the lights, which seemed to swoop down from above me and then turn north.  With the binoculars, I was able to discern a dark triangular shape which was completely silent, flying low and slow...maybe 500ft at about 50 knots.  I have never seen anything like this: there are always a lot of planes flying west over our house and then turning south to land at Boeing Field, but these planes are much higher and you can always hear the jet noise, helicopter blade noise or small prop engines.  As this unknown craft got farther up the lake, I was observing the tail of the craft and noticed flashing white, red and yellow lights somewhat like disco lights.  I estimate that this craft was about the size of a 737.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Triangle UFO in Seattle U-district;2004-11-05 16:15:00;Several seconds;Triangle UFO in Seattle U-district I walk outside to smoke.  It was 4:15 AM ish this morning, the 5th of November, and there is a large plane flying ridiculously low, with a powerful engine-sound.  Low low.  So low I think for sure it's going to go down, and it was a big plane, too.  So, given the positions of lights on this plane, and the fact that it was completely silouetted against the sky, i could see that this thing is an equilateral triangle.  It could still be a plane.  Just one of those completely triangular ones.  The thing passed again 10 or 15 minutes later, heading in the opposite direction, not flying as low (but still low).  This is definately a triangle.  I can see that thing.  It's a Tri-((deleted)).  I can't say if it was the same one.  but.  it probably was.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Bizarre object observed during dramatic display of aurora borealis.;2004-11-07 23:20:00;5 sec.;Bizarre object observed during dramatic display of aurora borealis. While observing a dramatic display of the aurora borealis from Cowen Park in the University District of Seattle, I observed a peculiar looking object glide across the sky, moving generally from south to north.  At first, I assumed that the object was a bird.  However, as my eyes focused on the object, I quickly realized that it was not consistent with a bird.  It moved smoothly across the sky, and no type of movement that would be consistent with flapping of wings was visible.  Moreover, even though the object was not well lighted, its shape seemed to be peculiar.  It appeared to be either triangular, or boxy, in shape, although that is a subjective analysis.  I do not know what the object was, but I do not believe it was either a bird, or any type of aircraft.  I am an avid bird watcher, and hold a commercial pilot's rating (former flight instructor).;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

At first I thought it was a big falling star because it came across in a perfect straight line, I believe it sort of cast a tail as well but I dont know I am completely overwhelmed...next five seconds later I thought what is that, then as it crossed directly overhead and on to the Southeast, I could see clearly that it was a triangular vehicle with round glowing circles on the bottom and the edges glowed...the whole thing glowed orange and not in a way I have seen in the sky before ...and here it was but no sound at all ....I was mostly impressed by the clarity of its shape and the straightness of its path it is hard to explain but it moved across the sky in a perfect line and in a way I cant describe...I never thought I would see anything like this I always thought if I did I would doubt what I saw ...but this was not like that....I think other people must have seen it as well ...;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

High, stationary, triangular-shaped object in sky;2005-07-13 16:50:00;20 min;High, stationary, triangular-shaped object in sky The sky was relatively clear with some high cirrus clouds.   Spotted the object as we were driving on I-5 in the sky next to a commercial airplane.   Airplane separated itself from the object and the object stayed stagnant.  The object was higher than commercial airplane by far.  Object was too high in the sky to be a helicopter or hot air balloon.   The object appeared to reflect light at different angles so I assume it was oscillating or pivoting.  As we continued driving with our rolled down windows the object was still stationary in the general area.  We then were too far North to see the object.

Low flying triangular object over Greenlake, Seattle.;2005-07-29 22:20:00;15 minutes;Low flying triangular object over Greenlake, Seattle. Myself and three of my roommates (all college students nearby) were driving through our Greenlake neighborhood, when one of us spotted a low flying object, triangular in shape.  It's shape was evident through the triangular shape of three lights on each point of the object.  It was flying low, and moving very slowly in some spots, faster in others...the driver tried to follow the object as far as possible, but we lost it about 15 minutes later.  Before following the object, myself and another roommate got out of the car to get some pictures. Interestingly, I was not the first to notice the object, but when my roommate pointed it out, I recognized the same shape as a similar object that I had reported over two years earlier.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

There were three dim yellow-orange lights at the corners of the object (not very bright) and other surface detail was difficult to discern.   The object seemed to be moving in an east-to-west direction and fairly slowly.  I was unable to locate the object after it passed above the trees.   Conditions were clear, nearly windless, about 55 deg. F.  There was no leading edge in the direction of travel i.e. it seemed to be turned slightly relative to direction of travel.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

I had setup my digital camera with telephoto lens and had started to take photos as the eclipse was occuring.   At approximately 2:35am my wife saw and object flying SW (approximately 242 degrees) nearly over head.  We both observed a black right triangle aircraft with its nose being the 90 degree angle travel at 200~240 knots in a steady continous glide.   There was no sound that we were able to detect coming from the aircraft.  The underside had an array of dimly lit white lights and that seemed to be made up of smaller lights which I saw forming circles.  There were no other visible markings or flashing lights or colors.   I did manage to track aircraft with my camera and I took 3 photos, but since I was set up to photograph the moon I don't seem to be able to find anything in the pictures.   As the aircraft traveled the lights seemed to get dimmer, which suggests to me that they may have been directional.     My wife and I decided to both sketch the aircraft and then compare what we saw.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

7 unblinking lights in triangle formation flying low and northward fast in seattle;2009-09-21 05:30:00;10 seconds;7 unblinking lights in triangle formation flying low and northward fast in seattle Going to my car in the morning to leave to work, I looked up and marveled how bright the stars were.  I was facing east, and turned my head slightly right to see Orion, when I noticed what I thought was a plane flying north.  I thought it unusual since most planes that fly as low as I perceived this one to be, fly south to SeaTac airport or Boeing Field.  Then I noticed that the lights were in a triangle formation, seven lights in all.  I could not discern the craft itself, and I didn’t have much time to do so, as it was flying quite fast across the sky.  It didn’t make the slightest sound, and since it was early morning the area around me was pretty quiet, I thought it odd.   I’ve never seen such a formation of unblinking lights on an aircraft before so I wondered if I had witnessed an unusual craft that is why I decided to report it here.

UFO in Seattle;2009-11-09 21:00:00;2 min;UFO in Seattle I am in my mid 30’s and believe I have seen my fist UFO.  I am not saying it was a ET UFO, but it was most certainly unidentified.  On November 9th 2009 at aprox 9:00pm I viewed an object that looked triangular in shape with a light on each corner.  I live on the top of Queen Anne in Seattle and see passenger planes flying over hourly on any given day.  The object I saw seemed to be a ~25% larger than a regular jet, and the speed was 50-75% the speed of usual jets flying over.  With help from google earth, I have tried to put the estimated coordinated of what I saw,  Starting at 47 37’56.35”N 122 22’06.94W traveling on a path towards 47 37’16.37”N 122 21’34.11W.

I actually saw something very strange tonight.  I live in ballard, wa.  My building has a rooftop deck. The sun had set and the sky was mostly dark now. I was smoking a cig, and watching the normal path of air traffic that flows into Seatac airport.  I just happened to be looking at a patch of ski to my south, when I noticed a flying V- shaped bommerrang craft flying lower than normal air traffic, about 1500 ft, traveling directly east at a high rate of speed.  It was completely dark..no aircraft lights at all and completely silent.  If, I held out my arm, it would take my entire hand to fully block the object. It blended in perfectly to the night sky.  It was more like watching an invisible shape blocking the sky behind it as it moved.  I watched the object travel from west to east until it disappeared in the distace and darkness (about 15 seconds).  I don't believe that anyone could have seen this object unless you just happened to be looking dir! ectly at it, as I was.  I feel kinda freaked out because, #1.  I definitely saw this. 2.

I saw a reddish bright something and wondered what it was, real low in the sky over the sound.It then appeared to get brighter and there was three distinct areas of light, flashing red to green in no pattern,I thought it must be a satellite, but then realized it was motionless.  I turned to look away to readjust my eyes after staring at it for a few minutes and when I looked back at it I turned my head to the side and the plane of the object then moved in the same direction.  This kind of freaked me out and I decided to test this out by moving my head to the other side and the object turned again to the side I turned to.I then decided it might be a good idea to go inside and I grabbed my keys and went to see some friends.When I went outside to get in my car,  I looked again and it was no longer there.I was not doing drugs, have 20/20 vision and had only 2 drin! ks earlier in the evening.I am not sure what this can be.

Three orange lights, triangle formation over Seattle.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;10 minutes;Three orange lights, triangle formation over Seattle. The event I witnessed occurred on the evening of July 4th, 2014 at 10:00pm + or – a few minutes. I was waiting for the Seattle 4th of July, 2014 fireworks to begin.  I was facing north, standing to the west side of the Museum of History and Industry at the South end of Lake Union.  I noticed one orange, non-blinking light appear high over the North end of the lake. More likely the light was over the Puget Sound.  The light moved slowly south and did not change size, color or brightness.   The first light was then followed by a second and a third at equal spacing, single file moving south.   When the lights were directly due west from me (over Queen Anne Hill) the lead light turned west and then disappeared but not behind the high cloud cover.  The second and third light followed the same route. Once the three lights were gone, a single orange none blinking light appeared at the same point of origin as the first three.  This single light stayed stationary.  At about the same time this single light appeared, 3 or 4 Helicopters moved to the West and could have been below the light. The sky was full of multiple aircraft and helicopters that night.  The marker and anti-collision lights are VERY obvious.  The lights I saw did not look or flash like aircraft lights. About 10 minutes later an orange light appeared as before, to the North of my location.  This time the second and third light appeared quicker and the three lights moved into a triangle position.  Again they moved South at the same speed and route as before.  The “lower” appearing light moved in and out, changing the shape of the triangle.  Again once the lights were due west of me, they appeared to go west and then disappeared.  This time the high cloud cover was going. They simply went out. I did get pictures of the lights.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Black transparent triangle shaped aircraft with bright white lights;2015-02-15 00:30:00;15;Black transparent triangle shaped aircraft with bright white lights. My friend and i where driving s.bound on 65th 15th n.w. off to the right of us up in the sky my friend said what the @&$! Is that i looked and at first i was ugh there were 3-4 (i cant recall exact pattern but amounts i know are true) sets of lights in rows of 4 bright as all get out and close to us not normal flight elevation for area, as soon as we saw them they shut down one row at a time then the aircraft?  Started moving towards downtown seattle no sound could be heard at all I also want to add there where no planes around at first which was strange cuase there always is, as it cont.  There was a small plane off to the distance like past downtown seattle and much further up in the sky it seemed and aircraft ? /ship or /ships( will get to that in a moment) it moved swiftly towards sm. aircraft as if it had no worries to crashing into but didn't, it hovered for a moment and changed course and again no planes no drones ect were in the sky it was also a very clear evening in the skies, so it started towards wallingford, freemont area ,if you know ballard im going to give you an example of how big this thing was or appeared from 15th n.w. looking towarrds the hill that goes to wallingford is a few miles no.  And so.  Bounds and this craft was literally covering almost the entire hill still in almost invisible motion and still very low im talking like almost right on top of houses .we both are tripping jaws hanging all i could say is it has to be a stealth moving as it was it was becoming more and more transparent it was a triangle shape and black and huge i mean huge.  I said we gotta see what this thing is and where the blank is it going my friend can only say what is that almost speechless almost frozen in augh. We followed it up the hill , now on aurora ave n. going south my friend pulled out his brother binaculars that are little more advance ( used in maritime) and handed me his phone to take pic's instead i hit record and it d! id for a few seconds then, my friend switched with me so i cou! ld see a better shot to be able to tell him what it is . We cont. driving so down aurora it started to lightly rain, me looking at craft but also the road, i had pulled over a cpl times too let friend take photos well in the meantime he stuck out his hand with camara out the window and was video taping ,at this point we could see what looked like a ring of bright red lights just for a brief moment underneath it . We both were taking about how nobody i mean nobody the entire time had stopped , pointing or looking up at it and can't believe no one else is seeing what were seeing even on busy aurora ave no one even blew their horn or stopped further down to see what were looking at, which is strange cause if and when i see people as in grossed as we were looking up at something its natural habit to also look as far as im concerned from experience. All of a sudden it had vanished mind you still no sound at all nor planes, drones ect.in these moments i had got on the phone to tell a frie! nd to look up in the sky to see it ( he lives in renton area), he kind of chuckled and laugh and said said something silly im kind of known as being a goof ball really meaning being silly to make people have a smile and laugh ? and my friend traveling with me well i'll describe him as being stuck in the 80's which i'm also known for too. We continued to look for it as we drove towards the friend in rentons house, both in just aughh trying figure out what on gods green earth did we just experience and why no one seemed a bit cauntious of any thing but what they were doing my friend was trying to look back at video but a lil hard on sm screen but never the less it was there in fact theres more than one as well as photos well you might think this was the end of it ,yeah no theres more , my friend could not stop with almost obsessing of it? As we picked our other friend up in renton , i mentioned to first friend look Now theres all kind of planes up in the sky as we drove south! to my house ( bonney lake) we were at boeing field area and w! e notice d two planes that did actually look like our military helicopters there was twoo and they were in like a certain position as though they were protecting or watching or guiding something slowly moving they become into a different formation , one slightly lower than other and was moving down towards the ground then there were a bunch of planes coming from all angles going into boeing field as well as seatac and most likely renton airfield as well it was crazy. So my friend quit in the back seat except for a few uttered words ( what the heck was that ,still looking at pic's and video ,we soon discovered ( here's where i mentioned i would get to later ) well it seemed as though there may have been more than one craft and that they looked as if they flew into the bigger one not only that and many lights flying around in speratic motions there is what we have learned to be a devil or evil figurine in a red light cloud that appears as if was watching us amongst other formations of different objects very clearly seen ( also later everyone who has viewed it agreed).  My friend is now in a spooked mood but still cant get over it he continued to look up in the sky as i did too and still, well he had been looking out my kitchen window and was seeing objects again but smaller in size like orb size in a neighbors yard and came to get me too see i told him its just porch or garage lights of neighbors he again began to video tape and well theres many suspected things seen including the very pronounced red cloud demon he was so scared he couldn't leave my room I tried to distract him by telling him it was probly this or that just to ease his mind.  Well there's a short almost thorough detailed story of my moment with what seemed to be not of this world as i've known it , my friend however has really looked in more depth to video's and pic's and will have more to add to his . Thank you for your time ((name and e-mail address deleted));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Two dark triangles spotted in West Seattle.;2015-11-03 19:30:00;4 seconds;Two dark triangles spotted in West Seattle. I was walking my dog in west seattle, up by High Point looking out towards the Puget Sound and saw a dark form cross the sky and it immediately caught my eye.  It was dark and flat and I thought it may have been a large bird at first then I noticed dim white lights at the tips which formed triangles.  The lights formed what looked like the outline of two dark triangles that were overlapping each other looking almost like one object.   Then they disappeared behind some clouds as they were moving across the sky quite quickly. It was definitely like nothing I have ever seen before!;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Three triangular objects with very, very bright lights moving in unison across the sky.;2016-02-05 18:30:00;30 minutes;Three triangular objects with very, very bright lights moving in unison across the sky. Coming down 1-5 south around Everett, WA, we noticed three very bright star-like objects down over Seattle.  They were spaced across the sky evenly apart from each other.  They stayed in that position for over 10 minutes or longer.   Then they started moving in together and as they did, the far right one when way up in the sky, and the left one started moving far left to where they made a huge triangle in the sky.  They stayed like that for about 3 minutes.  The top one disappeared upwards and the other two started moving to the far right and stayed together for a long time.   Then they would disappear and re-emerge.  It started getting light out and they all disappeared.   We tried to think that maybe they were helicopters, but they were in such precision, that is very doubtful.  So they were definitely unidentified, but an exciting morning.   I tried to take pictures but we were in a moving vehicle that didn't allow that to happed.   I would think lots of people saw this as they were driving down to Seattle from the north end.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
This event was recorded by the news station while videotaping the fire works at the Space Needle on New Year's Eve.((anonymous report));2018-01-01 00:00:00;30 seconds;This event was recorded by the news station while videotaping the fire works at the Space Needle on New Year's Eve and was broadcast on King 5 News.  I don't think the knew what they had recorded.  Nothing has been said in the newspapers.   Here is the video link: http://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle-rings-in-2018-with-new-years-at-the-needle/281-502828048   The event occurs at approximately 6.38 seconds into the video.  The object appears to be hovering over the Puget Sound on the left side of the screen.  It is a rather large object flashing green.  It is somewhat erratic in its lateral movement, then it rapidly shoots straight up in the air.  Just about that time the videographer cut away, so it was impossible to see where it went. ((NUFORC Note:  Object looks to us to be a small quadcopter/drone.  PD));47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

As I looked to the west just above the Olympic peninsula I noticed 3 red lights in a triangular formation, they  appeared to be heading west and up into the sky. Soon after one light disappeared and the other two followed.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
