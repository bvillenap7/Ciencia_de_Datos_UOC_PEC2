Lost sight of, then shape came back south to north, very fast. Object was very fast moving, chevron shape with one light at point, two on one side and one light on the other.  Object moved north to south across Shoreline area on Friday night, 8:15 pm.  My wife Roberta and I both saw it.  We lost sight of it rto the south, then it came to the north a long about the same flight path, very fast and smooth, no sound.  We thougth it might have been a spotlight, but there were no clouds and it did not repeat.  There were bright lights out over a soccer field and we thought it might have been a reflection or something, but again, the night sky was clear, you could see stars where the ufo passed, so there would be nothing for the light to reflect on.  Very cool.  First ufo sighting for us.  I'm a believer!;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

From south facing window, witnessed two aircrafts heading north,  low and close together.  Each had two very bright headlights and they appeared to be flying one on top of the other. They passed over the house seemingly skimming the trees it was then apparent that one was flying just behind and above the other. On the left underside of each were bright green letters and/or numbers, large enough to be read. There was a sound like an airplane, but not as loud as a jet that close. These crafts looked man-made, but I've never seen this large of a craft fly so low, slow or close together. I almost grabbed my daughter and ran from the house because they were so low. There was a small airplane flying above and east of the crafts, heading the same direction.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

4 golden/glowing chevrons moving across the sky in formation;2012-08-11 22:00:00;5 seconds;4 golden/glowing chevrons moving across the sky in formation Four of us stepped outside of our house to try to see some of the Perseid meteor shower.    We were all looking up in a northerly direction when 4 chevron shaped objects flew across the sky in an East to West direction.   The objects seemed to be moving in formation, with 3 above and 1 below.  They were very closely spaced together and glowing in a golden-yellow light.   The objects looked almost like birds flapping their wings, but none of us had ever seen glowing birds at night before.   We agreed that they were between 150-200 feet above us.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Two large shadowy chevron/triangles with amber glow at each point--high in the atmosphere;2019-08-12 22:30:00;2 seconds;Two large shadowy chevron/triangles with amber glow at each point--high in the atmosphere Sky was clear with bright moon.  Was watching for meteors.  (Perseids shower) I had just seen a fiery meteor flash across the sky from east to west.  About a minute after that, I saw two giant (I‚Äùm assuming giant because they seemed way higher up than normal aircraft) objects flying silently from northeast to southwest.  One right behind the other.  They seemed like black translucent/blurry shadowy chevron/triangles with a dim amber glow at each point of the chevron.  It seemed like they were behind a deep layer of clouds, causing the blur/glow, but the sky was completely clear last night.  They blurred across the sky silently and gracefully.  There were many planes in the air.  Every single craft made a noise or left a trail.  These were much larger, seemed higher up than any plane and were completely silent.  No sound, no trails. NOTE:  There was a power outage in Queen Anne yesterday morning, FWIW.  I saw this around 10:30 PM.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
