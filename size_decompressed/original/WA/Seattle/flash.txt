Less than a 1 second flash of large blue-white light, climbing slightly on it's path from west to east. .;1997-03-07 22:50:00;1 sec;Summary : Less than a 1 second flash of large blue-white light, climbing slightly on it's path from west to east. . I was traveling N. on Beall Rd. on Vashon Island when I saw a large blue-white light, larger than jet lights (common here), move from low left to 30 degrees higher toward the right (East).  Very fast.  Thought, Is this that comet?  But I don't think the comet is that huge or fast.   Doubt that this was a shooting star.  Trees obscured the progression path from my vision.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Bright, multi-colored (mostly green and blue, but some red) flashes across the eastern horizon.;1998-11-20 22:25:00;~10 minutes;Bright, multi-colored (mostly green and blue, but some red) flashes across the eastern horizon. There was quite a storm blowing outside this particular night, with a great deal of precipitation.  My wife and I were watching television on Friday night.  My wife said she thought she saw lightning in the sky.  I did't think much of it until I turned the TV set off and with the room being darker, I saw a flash myself.  I didn't see it directly, because a building next door was blocking it.  I kept looking and seconds later, there were many flashes across the eastern portion of the sky, but they were colored!  I had never seen anything like it.  The display was so remarkable, that I was literally shaking with fear.  I called my wife back to the window and she observed several flashes with me.  Some were low enough that they silhouetted the I-5 bridge before us.  It had the appearance of fireworks being obscured by clouds, except for the fact that it covered a far too great portion of the sky. From our vantage point, we can see directly to the east, and a bit to the north, with limited views to the south due to buildings close by.  At least one flash appeared to have structure to it, almost like a laser beam.  But again, this display covered a VERY large portion of the sky.  After about ten minutes the flashes stopped.  I spoke with my neighbor and he and his housemate saw them as well.  I was so taken by the experience that I called the police to report it as it was happening.  They reported some transformers were exploding, but nothing that matched what I saw.  I work at NOAA, and spoke to a meteorologist about it, and he could not offer an explanation either.  I'll never forget what I saw.  It was spectacular. Thank you.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966

The flashes were quite far off and looked like stars, it was clearly not a plane or helicopter.  The first three flashes could have been part of a single line. However then there was a fourth flash that was at right angles to that line. And this is what freaked me...and I got goose bumps.  Nothing known can do what this flashing object did that I know about.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Sun reflecting off long, thin object  following airliner, then airliner disappears' into small cloud.;2005-07-16 17:05:00;4 sec;Sun reflecting off long, thin object  following airliner, then airliner disappears' into small cloud. While looking due south from the rooftop parking lot of a Lake City (N. Seattle) store, I noticed an airliner - probably 3-5 miles distant - coming from the south and banking east.  I assumed it had just taken off from SeaTac Airport.  I noticed what appeared to be the sun glinting off of a horizontal object directly above the rear of the plane.  At first I thought it was an unusually large aerodome of the type seen on AWACS aircraft, but the 'glint' was fully half the length of the plane, and appeared just above and behind the vertical stablizer.  I saw no actual structure.  The plane immediately passed into or behind a small cloud whose apparent horizontal size was roughly 5 times the length of the plane.  I expected the see the plane emerge from the other side of the cloud in 2 - 4 seconds, but it never did!  This was VERY strange, as the cloud seemed too small to obscure even a quickly turning airliner.  I stared at the cloud for minutes, not knowing what to expect, but saw nothing emerge.  The cloud eventually merged with - or moved behind - another larger cloud, but had only clear blue sky around it when the incident occured.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Expanding and Disappearing Light;2005-07-18 12:20:00;5 seconds;Expanding and Disappearing Light Was waiting on a bus in the Ravenna Park area.  Something in my peripherial vision casued me to look up.  I saw what appeared to be a point of light that grew extremely bright over about a second or a second and a half then it dimmed over approx. 3 or 4 seconds to absolutely nothing.

Flashes of light south of Burien, WA.;2007-06-11 00:43:00;15 Minutes;Flashes of light south of Burien, WA. A bright orange, almost white, flash of light that continued for approximitely 10 minutes, flashed for about 5 seconds, stopped, and sometimes fainted away, for about 50 seconds before resuming flash again.  The object was south of Burien, WA. The object was increasingly more bright with each flash after about 8 minutes before slowly dying out and then stopping.  For the next couple of minutes it slowly flashed every 3 or so minutes, and then stopped at about 1:10AM Pacific time.  The shape was an egg.  It was a little longer than wide.  They moved slowly across the sky extremely slowly (if at all). There was 1, possibly 2 or 3. But there was 1 for sure, other smaller flashes were close to the brightest object that flashed. It was not very high in the sky.  The flash was distant.  It was a very big flash.  First I thought it was a plane, but the flash was too big and too bright to be a plane.;47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Flash of light over Seattle similar to rocket burn, moves upward quickly.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Iridium satellite.  PD);2007-08-30 20:30:00;5 seconds;Flash of light over Seattle similar to rocket burn, moves upward quickly While observing stars on a realatively clear night from an island in the San Juans at about 8:30 PM on August 30, 2007, northwest of Seattle, I noticed several satellites traverse the sky over a 15 minute time period.  After a lull of movement for several minutes a flash of light caught my eye.  As I focused on that point in the sky, it continued its sustained illumination (perhaps 2 seconds at the most) and then began moving in a northern (and upward?) direction as it became dimmer and dimmer. Within a few seconds it had vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Iridium satellite.  PD);47.6065879773274;-122.332927326966
Flash lit up Seattle skyline.

Flash had a bit of color in it, a little pinkish as it faded.  Illuminated entire skyline.  Flash happened twice in one minute, and then did not happen again.
