Saturday, September 07, 2013   The object was seen to the north of Dayton Washington over some of the hills. It was an orange light with a white center.  It was a singular object to our knowledge. It moved in a loop de loop very quickly and went over the hill.  Over the period of a half hour beginning at 9:00pm it was seen several more times coming back over the hill, moving through trees, and then back to the north side of the hill. The people involved with the sighting are 30 and 31, the 30 year old is a female, and the 31 year old is male. We were simply talking in her living room while her front door was open when we saw the object. I the male responded first by telling her I just saw a UFO.  Then as before stated, we saw the object several times over the next half hour.;46.3098;-117.9707
