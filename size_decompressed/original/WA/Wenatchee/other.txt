unless airplanes make 90 degree turns?;2004-04-09 20:30:00;2 minutes;unless airplanes make 90 degree turns? red light on top white light on bottom about 12 feet distance in between lights. they were flashing simutaniously. was heading south looking across river when I seen what looked like a tall tower with these 2 flashing lights in the saddle rock area. I asked the driver hey what is that light over there and by the time we passed a set of trees so she could see, it started moving toward east wenatchee and she said a plane. but then it started moving to fast to be a plane and I said I have never seen a plane move that fast before. It got about half way to horizon airport and instantly made a 90 degree turn heading back toward Wenatchee where the speed and altitude varied. We at that point knew this was no airplane. We pulled into the driveway and I stood outside for a good half hour and seen nothing further.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
Flashing and red lights dancing and looping in the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a twinkling star??  PD));2010-05-12 03:43:00;one hour;Flashing and red lights dancing and looping in the night sky. I saw what appeared to be a large plane flying sideways with several flashing lights.  However, with the different flashes, it appeared that there was possibly three levels to what I was looking at.  I watched the craft for a while, and then I saw several red lights dropping from it, two at a time.  The red lights would then swirl up, loop and zig zag around in the sky, turning white after a period of five minutes.  I called the police station and asked if any odd lights had been seen over East Wenatchee (My view was in Wenatchee, WA looking East), and nothing had been called in. I saw the same thing happen about a half hour later, but farther to the north, and higher in the sky. I also noticed, as I had the morning before, what looked like a binary (I think that's how it's spelled) star which was also doing something odd.  It was slowly moving higher in the sky from the north and moving west to east.  When the sun began rising, it was difficult to see the smaller white lights dancing around, however I did notice that they moved closer to this binary star and began swarming around it like fireflies, winking in and out.  The whole thing lasted for an hour, maybe a little longer, and I watched it all from the drive way. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a twinkling star??  PD));47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
Cluster of hazy, pulsating white lights.;2015-09-14 00:56:00;30 seconds +;Cluster of hazy, pulsating white lights At exactly 12:56 am on Sept. 14, 2015, I was letting my dogs out for their final run.  I looked up at the sky and notices a cluster of approx 20 hazy white lights.  I tried to count them but they kept rapidly changing formation.  This cluster kept pulsating, interchanging and dancing around each other as it moved fairly quickly through the sky.  Its direction when first noticed, was heading west then south then east. It eventually faded out when it went into the edge of a cloud cover.  The area that I observed it in was clear sky.  As it moved through the sky it would form somewhat of a circle then split into 2 different clusters, then somewhat of a line and at one point looked what formed a perfect arrow.  It was like it was alive and pulsating, I had to continue to move around the yard to follow its movement, but did not take my eyes off of it.  At one point both of my Chihuahua's started growling and that is when I started feeling very uncomfortable with what I was seeing.  I literally started trembling because its maneuver of changing directions was happening right above me.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
2 sightings in 1 night.;2015-09-16 00:12:00;30 seconds +;2 sightings in 1 night WA. state What the heck is going on!  I just posted another sighting on Sept. 14th.  I have seen 2 anomalies tonight.  The first  one was at approx. 11:25 pm (09/15/2015).  A jet was flying over heading from west to east.  Right behind it was  another object which I assumed was the International space station.  It was bright white and turned reddish as it receded into the horizon.  I looked up the ISS schedule and it was not due until 4:53 AM.   My second much more unexplained sighting, just happened a few minutes ago 12:12 AM (09/16/2015) and I would describe this as bird or boomerang shaped, hazy red in color.  It was flying at a high rate of speed coming from the east and heading Northwest.  It disappeared into some light cloud cover.  I observed it for about 30 seconds or so.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
