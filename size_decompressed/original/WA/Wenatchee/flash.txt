A bright Blues ball of light flashed above me and a co-worker leaving me seeing spots for two hours.;2002-02-22 01:30:00;2 hrs;A bright Blues ball of light flashed above me and a co-worker leaving me seeing spots for two hours. I am Currently working as a security guard at a major fruit warehouse.  I am ex-military, I have traveled around the world several times and I have always watched the skies, so I have no problem identifying aircraft, lightning, satellites, stars, and most anything else in our night skies. Last night at approximately 0130 while making my rounds I noticed a light blue flash of light from behind a ridge line 12 miles to the south of me.  I drove up on to the small hill on the west side of the warehouse were I could see better and watched in that direction for a while (This is not the first time I have seen this happen in Wenatchee.  I saw this once before in November 1995, 30 minutes before a diamond shaped UFO flew north up the Columbia River.  This was witnessed by at least two on duty police officers.).  As I watched the surrounding area I turned on the hand held scanner that I have to see if anyone had reported seeing it but nothing was said about it.  After 30 minutes I started making my rounds again and made a note of the temperature reading at the scales, it was 34 degrees (and dropped to 32 by 0400).  At approximately 0245 I was driving on the hill on the west side of the warehouse (and watching the ridge line) when the flash occurred again in the same area but much brighter.  Again I sat and watched and again nothing happened. At 0300 a co-worker arrived and I told here about these flashes (She looked at me like I was crazy) and we both agreed that even though it was cloudy, it was probably to cold for lightning.  She left to check the refrigeration equipment and returned at 0345 to tell me about a door that was opened.  At this point we were sitting in our trucks with the engines off and the windows down and talking.  There was no equipment running and no one else on this side of the building, so it was very quiet out.  As we were talking I was facing east towards the Columbia river, her truck was pulled up to my truck about 2 feet away, when the whole inside of here truck just suddenly flashed into a blue glow.  I turned my head towards the front of her truck and up and saw a Dark blue object, below the cloud base and over the river, that seemed to pulsate as it got brighter and then suddenly flashed and went out.  It lit up the whole area around us for about 4 seconds, and was bright enough to leave spots in my eyes for around 2 hours, but there was no sound.  Nothing else was seen the rest of the night.

I proceeded to look around the sky and saw another plashing object above badger mountain.  I then watched the one in the direction of southwest, and that when just suddenly disappeared. shortly after I saw a shooting object fly from the direction of badger mountain.  at this point in time I noticed air traffic came to screeching hault.  shortly after planes began to fly throught he area again only to be stopped by another flying oblect it seems.  I had been watching the oblects for so long I could actually make out their signals to one another.  one oblect would flash multiple colors, green, red, blue, purple and then dim to one white color.  and then a corresponding object would then flash its colors.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
