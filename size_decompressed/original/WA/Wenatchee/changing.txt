Flying plane stops, changes shape, and then crashes;1989-01-15 15:00:00;3 minutes;Flying plane stops, changes shape, and then crashes My experience happened when I was around 10 years old, so somewhere around 1989.  It was winter, and my best friend (and neighbor) and I were sledding in their orchard behind their house.  We had just sledded to the bottom of a hill and were lying in the snow looking up at the sky, when an object that looked like a low flying airplane flew into sight above us.   We both stared at it. The object obviously came to a stop right above us and we had a great opportunity to view the lights around the craft, I believe they were yellow, red, green and possibly blue. They blinked on and off at different times, almost appearing that one light could blink different colors.  It scared us, as we had never seen an airplane just stop like that before.  Then, the wings seemed to fold back into the craft and it darted off very quickly and appeared to crash in a draw in the nearby hills. We ran for her house as fast as our legs would carry us through the snow. Her mother instantly knew something was wrong, and listened to our frantic recaps of what we had just seen.  It bothered her enough that she called the police. Two police officers arrived at her house a short while later, and one took my friend into a room and one took me into a different room, out of earshot of each other.  They had us each tell them what we saw, and draw pictures of it.  Afterwards, the cops compared our stories and pictures, which were identical. This was before cell phones, and I distinctly remember the one cop asking to use the home phone to make a few phone calls.  I was able to overhear some of what he said, he was checking to see if anyone had special test flights going on, and no one did.  He also confirmed no planes were in the area and that no planes were reported missing and/or crashed. They then sent a crew up to the hills and they said they combed the entire hillside we pointed them to, and never found a single thing.  And that was the last I ever heard about it. To this day, I can still picture what we saw.  It haunts me.   Maybe it was a UFO, maybe it was some special craft that was being tested that was classified, or maybe we hit our heads while sledding - though that is unlikely.  All I know is I have never seen or heard of anything like it since then. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
Hazy red object that changed shape and moved erratically.;2007-09-16 01:35:00;30 seconds;Hazy red object that changed shape and moved erratically. I was outside at approximately. 1:35 AM when this red object caught my eye. It was not a brilliant, fiery red but more of a hazy red. At first it looked like it was bird shaped but other times it morphed into an almost round shape. It darted and danced about the sky and was heading from East to West direction. At times it looked like there were darker red lights around the outer perimeter. I kept thinking get your camera, get your binoculars but I knew it would be gone before I even got back with them. I am a sky watcher and have seen some strange things, but nothing ever like this.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
Black object over Wenatchee, WA.;2009-02-14 16:00:00;5 minutes;Black object over Wenatchee, WA. Being the sky watcher that I am, at Approximately 4 pm (I do not know the exact time) I noticed what appeared to be a very large bird up in the sky. I ran into the house and called my family out. As we watched it, it began morphing and changing shapes. We then agreed at this point  that it was not a bird. My Brother In Law ran to his car and got his binoculars out to try and get a better look. By the time we got it into sight it has risen up considerably and he mentioned that it  looked like 2 parachutes connected together but was still changing shapes. The only problem with that theory, is that this object, like I said was rising up (not down like a parachute) as it moved East. The thing that really struck me was that it was SO black in color, in a way, blacker than the color black truly is. I also want to note that my Brother in Law is with the Air Force and he estimated that the object was at 10,000 feet. Towards the end of the sighting as he continued to observe with the binoculars he said that the object split into 2 possibly 3 before it disappeared from sight. He is a cut and dry Military person and this event really shook him up.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
