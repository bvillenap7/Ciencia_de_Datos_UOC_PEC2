One incident caught my attention as I believe that it was the same one that we saw and also have on video as well as the airplane that is mentioned in the story below. I called a local radio station after the event and they said that nobody else had reported anything. Below is the other persons version of the incident. We were standing facing East and the objects were a little to the South East of us.My recollection of details may not be 100% accurate at this point. We were watching two amber lights, the top one was stationary and the bottom one was slowly dropping down from the top light. The lights would get very bright and then dim, flicker out and then reappear. The top light finally went out completly. The second light started pulsating and then all of the sudden split into 2. The light that broke away shot straight out to the right and a very high rate of speed meeting up with about 4 or 5 other lights that were barely visable and eventually dimmed from sight. On the end of the video we see a large ball of white light that again gets very bright and dims. We can be heard discussing weather or not it is a plane but eventually decide that we do not know what it was either. Occurred : 12/8/1997 19:40 (Entered as : 12/08/97 19:40) Reported : 4/1/1998 07:51 Posted : 1/28/1999 Location : E. Wenatchee, WA Shape : Light It was a ball of light that was orange in the center with a red haze around it. When it passed overhead it broke in two and continued on, and broke into other pieces. The object which was a ball of light that had an orange center and a red haze around it, was approx. 4,000 ft. up because it just barely cleared the mountains (Cascades? Leavenworth area), as it was traveling from west to east, at a constant speed, little faster than a cessna. As the object was overhead, it broke into 2 pieces. The second piece broke away at a 90 degree angle and remained at a distance approx. 500 ft. from the first object and continued parallel through the sky. Both objects sent smaller objects toward one another and continued east when we lost the object over badger mountain. The sky was clear, no clouds, it was night. There was another aircraft in the vicinity but it was not chasing the object. The object produced no noise, no tail and no sparks. The other witness, contacted the local airport and was informed that nothing was seen. I contacted McChord Airforce base in Tacoma, WA and was told to contact the local police. I have also contacted MUFON and no answer has ever been given. I can tell the difference between an object re-entering the earth, like a rocket or falling satelite, this object maintained this altitude, and there was no tail at all. I have an AAS degree, with a major in engineering and computer science. I would like an explanation of what we saw.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
Three adults and four children viewed nine star-like orange-yellow lights in the eastern horizon moving in random directions with;2002-12-31 23:50:00;30 minnutes;Three adults and four children viewed nine star-like orange-yellow lights in the eastern horizon moving in random directions with We saw 9 lights to the east in two groups.  One group, the upper, consisted of three lights at about 20 degrees above the horizon oriented in a vertical formation.  The lower group consisted of six lights more tightly grouped at about 15 degrees above the horizon.  The general location of all the lights was 70 degrees east of magnetic north.  All the lights were were moving slowly in random directions.  All the lights were identical in color and the color was orange-yellow.  The lights looked like bright stars in appearance.  Not as bright as some of the brighter planets on a clear night, but nearly so.  Also, all nine lights were identical in brightness. The lights twinkled in appearance as stars do, and they had no discernable shape other than a point of light.  I looked at the lights with a set of binoculars to try to determine a shape and found no change other than being slightly brighter in appearance with less twinkling.  Twice I saw other fainter lights dropping from the larger-brighter lights.  As the viewing period progressed the two groups of lights moved together as one group oriented somewhat vertically on the horizon.  One by one each light vanished toward the end of the viewing period. None of these lights behaved like an aircraft or meteor.  They appeared to be hovering and moving up, down, and sideways in a random fashion.  All nine lights behaved independantly of one another. Witnesses:  Three adults and four children.  All three adults are professed UFO skeptics.  Two of the adults have Bachelor of Science degrees.  One in Mechanical Engineering and the other in Chemistry.  The Mechanical Engineer has been and aviation enthusiast most of his life and is frequently viewing stars and aircraft in the skies.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519

Bright fast moving light.;2009-03-29 20:00:00;2 Minutes;Bright fast moving light. I was outside on the deck taking a few pictures of the moon above the sunset and I noticed a light that was not blinking, and traveling at high speed well above the normal height I see passenger jets. Really it looked like Venus, but moving fast. It continued east and turned slightly to the south and then disapeared over the horizon. I didn't notice any colors or any variations just bright. Based on the speed that passenger jets fly over I would say it was traveling 2-3 times faster. Possible a little more.  I wasn't able to take any pictures but I did get it on video, but it looks like a bright dot. I can email the video if interested.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519

I kept watching and about 30 minutes later noticed 3 more. Total of 6.  All 6 were pretty close to each other.  Five of them flew east then there was one left and it went south.  They looked like round white lights.  No sound was made by these.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
The low altitude and slow speed of objects is what caught my attention;2010-12-29 19:00:00;10 min;The low altitude and slow speed of objects is what caught my attention We were driving from wenatchee to leavenworth at about 7pm when I noticed 2 red lights in the sky above moniter WA  we drove directly underneath the lights estimated altitude of less than 3 miles we pulled over on the highway (sr 2) and other cars were pulling over to look at them they appeared to be traveling NNW at a very slow speed I called some friends in leavenworth to have them go outside and see if he could see them and he could not, so this supports the low altitude I calculated. They were not aircraft (lack of flashing red or landing lights) I am a U.S. Army vetran with experiance in identifing aircraft;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519

streaking brilliant light;2011-10-24 18:00:00;5 sec;streaking brilliant light My 10 year old son and I were at Walla Walla park in Wenatchee.  The time was approximately 1800-1900 HRS. We were walking to our truck, my son ahead of me.  I saw that he had froze and he was looking up.  I also looked up to see a bright object shooting north, north east direction. There was no tail or smoke.  It was still day light and no clouds in the sky. I am sorry for not noting the time, I did not know of this reporting system until this morning. My sighting lasted 3-5 seconds, longer for my son.  It may have lasted longer but we lost sight of it as it was blocked by Birch Mountain.

Glowing light that moved, stopped, glew brighter and dimmed out.;2012-06-15 19:00:00;~20 seconds;Glowing light that moved, stopped, glew brighter and dimmed out. About 3 or 4 years ago, I was walking with my dad to the store in Wenatchee, Washington, (which is a little town in the desert mountains) at about 7 or 8 at night, and I spotted a light with a little glow around it that was slowly moving horizontally.  I watched it move for a few seconds while I was walking, and I stopped and pointed it out to my dad.  We were watching it for about ten seconds when it stopped, grew brighter, and then it quickly got smaller and smaller like it dimmed out (my personal theory was that it warped away).   I am certain it wasn't a meteor or a comet because of how slow it was moving, it didn't have a tail, and the fact that it stopped dead.  The whole encounter was probably about 20 seconds.  The thing that really freaked me out was that it seemed to disappear after we stopped and watched it, almost as if it was watching us.  Either that or we just happened to encounter it just at the right time.   Even though the encounter wasn't that much, I still get emotional thinking about what it could be that I witnessed.

Dozens of lights rising in a staggered line from the hillside.   The lights appeared like floating lanterns, though had a significant amount of light considering the distance.   They rose to a fairly high altitude before being obscured by the clouds and new ones were rising as I brought more people to see.   There were some already high in the sky upon first sighting and more rose from the hill over the next 5-10 minutes.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519

Bright red lights seen over Wenatchee.;2014-12-31 19:00:00;15 minutes;Bright red lights seen over Wenatchee. Bright red light, with rays coming off like a star, came over the hills from the the west.  It slowly came down into the valley and then went quickly went up into the sky becoming smaller looking like a red star.   As the first one was going up, a second bright  light came over same hill and slowly came down into valley and proceeded a little further down the valley.   Just before it started up into the sky, a third bright red light came over the same hill and as it came into the valley the second red light quickly went up into the sky.   Before the second light disappeared, a fourth bright red light came over the same hill, as the third light was going more over Wenatchee.  Then, the third and fourth bright red lights went quickly up into the sky quickly becoming smaller lights, the same size in appearance as the stars in the sky, then they were gone.

All three were flashing lights.  The center one was mostly red and flashing faster than the other two.  The two on the outside perimeter were mostly white with some flashing slightly reddish.  They seemed to move in unison, slowly across the sky.  I would say there was some distance between them.   We are out almost nightly observing the night sky and have never seen these lights before.  Not anything normal out of Pangborn Airport I would venture to say.  We live at the top of a Canyon and have an excellent view of the Wenatchee Valley.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519

Powerful flash of light about every 15 seconds.  It was going so fast that the flashes of light were an elongated tube of brilliant blue trailing the object with every flash.   I watch the satellites regularly and it's not that common, but some will flash a powerful light.  This one I'm talking about was hypersonic with a flash.  Two years ago, my wife saw 5 different ufos over Wenatchee in a 6 night and day period, she reported some to both mufon and NURC.  It got to the point that she was afraid to look up at the sky!   There was an Air Show at Pangborn Airport over a month ago, and I was following a DC3 over Wenatchee with binoculars, when I spotted what looked like an aluminum pop can in the distance with one jagged end like a firecracker blew out one end.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
UFO in Wenatchee, Washington. Multiple videos including myself for evidence.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus??  PD));2020-03-22 21:00:00;2.5 hours;UFO in Wenatchee, Washington. Multiple videos including myself for evidence. Went outside to smoke and I seen this light come out of nowhere.  And then I stood outside and I watched it for about 20 minutes and then I called my next-door neighbor out and we stood there for about an hour and watched it. And during the whole hour and a half or so this object never moved.  I thought it was a droin, or a satellite balloon or the planet Venus.  Then I called my friend who lives in East Wenatchee and I asked if he could see it and he said yes.  But then I go outside and hour and 15 minutes later and it still there and then all of the sudden it takes off superfast and then it’s nowhere in sight.  I wrote about it in our town Facebook page and apparently a lot of people caught this on Camera. And said that it’s been happening often since last summer.  It’s my first account of any such thing. According to my friend in East Wenatchee & other video recordings that were made when I seen it fly off it really wasn’t gone it had moved to over the mountain . But it is all over town‘s Facebook page. My video is a bit shaky but if you look on Wenatchee rants and raves then you will see under my posting other videos that were taken last night.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
