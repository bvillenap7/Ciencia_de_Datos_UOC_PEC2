Large shooting star over eastern sky;2004-12-21 21:10:00;Seconds;Large shooting star over eastern sky While leaving a Christmas party (where neither I or my husband consumed alcohol), I looked to the eastern skyline and saw a shooting star larger than I have ever seen in my life.  It loked as if it had perhaps entered the atmosphere.  The head was colorful, purple and green.  The tail was yellowish like a normal shooting star.  I exclaimed my amazement, and my husband looked up in time to see the tail end of the streak.  I came home and checked the news to see if anything had crashed, but apparently not.  I love watching meteor showers, but this was like nothing I have ever seen in my life.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
saw huge falling star;2006-08-14 22:15:00;< 1 second;saw huge falling star I went to retrieve groceries from my car.  It's very dark in the driveway, no street light.  I can see lots of stars for being in town.  From NE to SW a huge falling star flashed across my upper perihelial vision, since I wasn't looking directly into the sky.  It had a large misty aura around it.  About the size of my fist at arm's length.  No sound as it disappeared behind the tall hill beside Castlerock (lava outcrop).  I don't know what I saw but it didn't leave the Feeling in me that it was actually a meteorite - mostly because of that huge glow.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
