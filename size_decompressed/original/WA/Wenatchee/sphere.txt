Twin satellites moving together and one shoots off in to space;2007-07-15 22:00:00;5 minutes;Twin satellites moving together and one shoots off in to space In July 2007 my wife and I were sitting in a field in eastern Washington state late one warm crystal clear night and I was staring up at the stars and noticed what I thought were a couple of orbiting satellites that were travelling in the same direction and fairly close to each other as far as satellites go.  I mentioned it to my wife and she looked up and she saw what I saw.  What appeared to be two Sat’s moving in the same direction and very close to each other.  She turned away and just said, What a coincidence that has to be a million to one chance to see that in the sky.  I continued to watch and noticed that both of them stopped at the same time and same spot in the sky side by side.  They stayed in that position for about a minute or longer. They didn't drift the entire time I was watching. They appeared to be fixed in one position together.  They had the same brightness of orbiting Sat’s, no blinking lights or changing colors.  I said to my wife, Lookup the two Sat’s have stopped.   She looked up just in time to see one of them shoot off into space in a blink of an eye.  There was no streak of light like a meteor entering our atmosphere just a bright ball heading off in to the darkness of space.  The other Sat resumed on its original course from the Northwest to the Southeast.  I have seen a lot of Sat’s in my day but I would have to be hard pressed to say that those two bright balls of light were your average Sat’s.   We are your average people, I believe that there is something out there my wife does not.  But she was shocked at what we saw that night.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519

I was a couple miles south of 28 w when up in the sky, above my truck, from east to west, a red orb lower than a plane ought to have been, between 500-1000 ft, went across the sky faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. No sound, exhaust or tail. It seemed like a shooting star but way slower and no tail. It was the weirdest aerial phenomenon I have ever seen. It crossed the entire sky in a matter of seconds.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
