Green, circular object moving from NW to NE across the Western Hemispere night sky, being visible for 5-15 seconds;2001-08-25 21:00:00;5-15 seconds;Green, circular object moving from NW to NE across the Western Hemispere night sky, being visible for 5-15 seconds This object was circular, emerald green in color, moving from NW to NE about 30 degrees above the horizon, in a steady motion. In size relationship, it was the size of a beach ball as if it were thrown across the sky. A concert was being performed by Willie Nelson at Paul Thomas Field, Wenatchee Valley College. It appeared from the viewer's left of the stage, crossing at a steady rate, travelling in a 45 degree descent behind and eventually disappeared below the horizon to the right of the stage. Many people were witness to it, none confirming its identity.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
Gray sillouttte against the night sky, moved quickly side to side, then darted away above the trees.  Fast moving and odd..not plane.;2002-08-15 00:00:00;1 minute;Gray sillouttte against the night sky, moved quickly side to side, then darted away above the trees.  Fast moving and odd..not plane. My boyfriend, son and I were camping and laying out watching the stars and around midnight on the fifteenth I saw what looked like two shooting stars coming out of the corner of my eye.  It confused me because it didn't seem normal, as we hadn't seen much all night.  It moved closer and we could all make out a dark round silloutte illuminated a little lighter then the sky (gray).  It moved very quickly left to right and then did that same movement about three times.  Suddenly it darted out above the trees and we couldn't see it anymore.  It made no sound and didn't fly like a jet could.  It moved too fast back and forth (side to side).  I am still kind of in shock.  Never gave UFO's much thought.  We all saw it though and we were all amazed.  Still is sinking in.  Hard to believe, but true none the less. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
Bright round light slowly moving then disappeared.;2011-04-11 22:30:00;15 seconds;Bright round light slowly moving then disappeared. At approx 2230 hours Monday night, while looking to southeast I saw one bright round white orb of light perhaps above the Quincy distance to the east (30 miles east of Wenatchee) and observed it moving north at very slow speed, then it went out with no further observation by my wife or I.  This was no aircraft, they don't behave like that.  Years ago I saw one just to our east, way late at night, slowly moving, then hauling ass south to the Columbia River then straight up and gone.  Nothing of this earth moves that fast.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
A silent light in the sky that flew in the area.;2012-08-10 21:40:00;About 3 minutes;A silent light in the sky that flew in the area. At around 9:40 PM on Friday August 10, my Dad, Mom, and I were sitting on the deck watching the stars (This routine is somewhat regular when it is clear in the sky) when a bright light appeared in the distance and slowly headed our direction.    At first I believed it was a satellite high in the sky but as it got closer I realized it was moving to slow and flying way too low for it to be anything of that sort. It moved closer and closer and it traveled passed our house and proceeded to travel until I lost visual due to other houses blocking my vision.  The Sighting lasted for about 3 min. from first notice until I lost visual contact with it.  The object was completely silent and very bright.  Planes fly in the sky around here a lot and are visible with their flashing lights this object was slightly lower than a plane, was dead silent, and had constant light coming from it.  This object was unlike anything I have seen before and I have watched the sky enough to kn! ow that it was in the atmosphere and not way up in space, and to know it was not an identifiable aircraft to me, or my parents.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519

9:14 to 9:17 circular object approx 200 ft wide floated over house perfectly silent and brilliantly lit.;2014-08-18 21:14:00;3 minutes;9:14 to 9:17 circular object approx 200 ft wide floated over house perfectly silent and brilliantly lit. I and my wife were sitting in our back yard under a moonless sky. At 9:14 pm, we seen a circular formed object that was brilliantly lite up float over our house.  This object looked two hundred feet in diameter, had what looked like white strobe lights going in a circular fashion around the main body.  It was absolutely silent.   We watched it for about three minutes before I decided to call and report it.   I would have sworn that it was some sort of blimp, but having an aviation background I have not seen anything like it before.   About two minutes after the initial call, we saw a couple of what looked like military jets, heading the same direction as the object.  I personally seen one and my wife said she seen a second.   The object came out of the Northeast and headed southeast.  Pretty awesome.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
