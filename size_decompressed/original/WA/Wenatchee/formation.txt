3 lights suspended over Wenatchee just before midnight Dec 31 lasting at least 8 mins;2002-12-31 23:50:00;5--10mins;3 lights suspended over Wenatchee just before midnight Dec 31 lasting at least 8 mins KPQ radio announcer: take a look out over the city towards the river...does anyone know what that is.... looked out (our house is on a hill, slightly above roof-top level of the city), saw 3 yellow  orange lights, slightly more intense than stars and about an index finger length apart in sight length-not on a straight line. They did not vary in distance from one another, nor did they move. The intensity of light would change on each independent of the other, and they faded out independent of one another. Saw something faint stream down as they began to fade. One reappeared independent of the others and continued 3-5 mins(?). Would have guessed that someone launched a New Years' display, but how did they keep them equal distance apart??? ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports of this event.  We do not know what people witnessed.  PD));47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519

She called me out to say that she was seeing balls of light in the sky.  This was located north of Wenatchee.  We are in south Wenatchee.  They were shooting up off of what looked like Birch Mountain. It began with 9, but 2 of the orbs or balls of orange/red light disappeared immediately, the other 7 seemed to rise up in the air, the color never changing or dimming in any way.  At firt they  flew into a triangle formation, then went to a straight line.  These lights did not blink or flicker ever.  They spread out without moving it seemed, but moved to the east little.  Then one by one they disappeared.  Just like a light had turned off.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519

Bird-shaped lights in V-formation.;2016-10-18 23:16:00;10 seconds;Bird shaped lights in V formation. Tonight at 11:16PM.  I was standing outside with my dogs when I noticed a V-shaped formation.  The formation was made up of approx. 6 to 7 individual bird shaped objects. They were hazy red in color and would break formation slightly and come back together to form a perfect V.  The lights had a slight flickering or pulsation to them.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed.  From when I first noticed it, to when it disappeared from sight. The sighting lasted approx. 10 seconds  It was traveling from East to West.  My Husband was just inside by the door when I yelled for him.  He was able to glimpse the last 5 seconds of this event.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
