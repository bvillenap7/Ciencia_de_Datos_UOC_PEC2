U.F.O. Witnessed by 2.;2003-03-03 10:40:00;5 Minutes;U.F.O. Witnessed by 2. Went to take out garbage and looked up and noticed a bright light in the western sky.  The light seemed much too bright for the distance I guaged the object at.  Within a matter of seconds the object almost seemed to zero in on me dodging left and right in an unfamiliar pattern at various speeds.  I called to my girlfriend to come and see, as she came to the door we both saw a large circular structure or sphere with bright white lights on the left and right sides, red at the bottom and a sort of blue or green at the top.  The craft traveled from apprx. 5 miles away to 50 feet above my head in probably 20 seconds. I am a retired software consultant.  I have been very skeptical/analytical about supposed sightings for the great part of my adult life.  But what I saw tonight will change my reality forever. My girlfriend is a college student/waitress. She witnessed the event with me and concurred with my description.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
