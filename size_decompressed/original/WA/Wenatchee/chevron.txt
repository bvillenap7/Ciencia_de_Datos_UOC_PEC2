Two pink/orange chevron shaped objects flying north with no sound.;2006-09-24 00:18:00;15 seconds;Two pink/orange chevron shaped objects flying north with no sound. Two pink/orange chevron shaped objects flying North. They were fairly low, as low as most small airplanes in our area fly, but these made no sound at all. They were not flying parallel to each other. The one following behind kind of zig zagged briefly and scooted over to catch up or get a little closer to the other. Then they retained their formation and we watched until we couldn't see them anymore. They weren't very bright, kind of hazy. They almost seemed a little irridescent. One more thing, I have never seen a plane in this area flying north, only East and West.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
