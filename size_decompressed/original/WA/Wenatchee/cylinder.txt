Very bright with bumps on it's surface. Very graceful movement Iwas sitting in my backyard having a coffee and smoke when I happened to look up into the sky. I observed a cylinder shaped object . It appeared to be at the altitude of a commercial airliner, moving somewhat slower than a commercial jet. If it was at the cruising altitude of an airliner it would have been at least one and a half their size. The thing seemed to yaw slightly as it moved from the northwest to the southeast. It was definetly cylinder shaped with no wings or vertical stabilizer. I observed sunlight glinting off it's surface.  I'm a formal aircrewman with extensive training in the observation of aircraft and I know this wasn't any kind of aircraft ,military,private or commercial that I know of.  It was absolutely silent during the observation period and moved with a strange kind of grace and ease that is hard to put into words. I also noticed that there were bumbs or blisters scattered in an uneven pattern over its surface. These bumps were not readily apperant, but were noticed as sunlight glinted unevenly across it's surface. Thanks;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
