Cigar-shaped, silver craft moving at high rate of speed.;2017-10-16 15:52:00;4 seconds;Cigar-shaped, silver craft moving at high rate of speed. At 3:52 pm I was standing in the doorway of my garage, looking north.  I noticed a cigar shaped, silver colored craft heading from east to west at a rapid rate of speed.  It turned sharply and headed north.  I was trying to rule out plane or bird as I witnessed the event.  It was neither as it was moving so fast and turned on a dime, changing direction.   I will be submitting an additional report immediately following this one involving another sighting 2 hours, later witnessed by myself and Husband.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
