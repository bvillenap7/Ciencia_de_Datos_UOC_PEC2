Bright star blinked out and reappeared in new location twice.;2017-04-03 02:28:00;45 minutes;Bright star blinked out and reappeared in new location twice I awoke late at night and went to the kitchen to get a drink then decided I wanted a cup of tea so I put the water on and sat down at the table.  I have two large windows 3ft√ó6ft one faces east and slightly South the other South and slightly West so I have a great deal of sky visible, I often sky watch at night.  Last night was cloudy and I noticed no stars were visible from the East window as I put the water on but when I sat down one VERY bright star was in the southern sky.  I watched it for a few minutes wondering what star it was and noticed it seemed to be bouncing around just a bit so I decided to take a video of it.  It didn't turn out well as I couldn't keep it centered (that's all on me) so I took a couple of snapshots of it and was trying to video it again when it simply blinked out!  While I was contemplating what had just happened I made my tea and sat down to look at the pictures I had taken and was stunned by the saucer shaped object quite plainly there where the star should have been. I didn't see it while looking at it with just my eyes.  I sat drinking my tea watching out of the window when when &#8203I saw it again about 60 degrees west and much higher.  I quickly took several more photos this was about 3:15am it blinked out again and appeared farther away yet and my cellphone camera could no longer photograph it.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
