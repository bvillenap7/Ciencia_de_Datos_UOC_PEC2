I looked out my launddry room window and saw the most amazing thing i have ever seen . Hanging in the northern sky were a line of blood red brilliant lights. These weren't flares. It was reported by the radio announcer that these lights manuevered but I didn't see that. I did see small orbs of brilliant lights emerge from the larger spheres, the main bright lights were reminiscent of the phoenix lights. They formed a gentle arc in the northern sky and drifted slowly to the west. At no time did they descend (as flares would do). As they drifed west they began to wink out . One sphere stayed lit as it drifted out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the date of the event was 12/31/02 we have amended the date.  PD));47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519

A large, yellow, fiery object hovered over the Wenatchee Valley.;2013-10-22 07:30:00;8 minutes;A large, yellow, fiery object hovered over the Wenatchee Valley. My wife was driving to work heading south in West Wenatchee.  She looked up and saw a large, yellow, oval-shaped object which she described as appearing to be on fire.  She stated that the object was comparable to the size of the moon and was completely stationary.  No sounds could be heard.   The sky was completely cloudless and the sun was just beginning to rise.   When she looked away for just a few seconds and turned back to look at the object, it had disappeared.   At this point, she texted me to tell me she had just seen a UFO!  I called her and asked her to give details of the sighting, as I was heading out to take my daughter to school.   Suddenly, my daughter and I both saw an object above the hills in East Wenatchee.  My wife, who was on the phone with me, also saw the object,   At this point, the object appeared white but definitely oval-like and about the size of a pea.  If it was indeed the same object that she had seen just moments before, then it would've had to travel at a remarkable speed to move such a distance.   Also, we noticed that three jets, flying very high, were heading toward the object.   We would've continued to monitor the object but had to go to work.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
4 amber/orange object hovering over The Clockum area.;2014-01-01 00:00:00;3.5 minutes;4 amber/orange object hovering over The Clockum area We live in East Wenatchee Washington on Blue Grade Rd,  and at midnight on New Year's Eve we looked out the windows to watch all the fireworks around the valley.  I looked towards The Clockum Area and there were 4 Amber colored lights in the sky all at different heights in the sky.  I noticed one begin to move upwards and the one next to it followed.  I called to my two friends to look at what I was seeing.  They saw the same thing.   We watched as these 4 lights moved up and down several hundred feet at a time. 2 of the lights would be moving while the other two held still.  After watching for a minute I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look at what we were seeing.   What I saw still is difficult for me to describe.  This craft seemed to have more than one level, at least 2. It was pulsating and there's was so much going on with the lights inside this large object.  The object was orange/Amber in color.  One object appeared to have a globe shape on the top.  I handed the binoculars to my friend and asked her what she saw.  She couldn't speak for bit. She too couldn't believe what she was seeing, and was having difficulty explaining it.  After seeing the first two thru the binoculars, I went to look at the other two lights and they were gone.  My friend saw it shoot straight up into the sky while I was looking at the others.   The 2 remaining lights were still hovering and moving around in the sky, traveling what appeared to be several miles at a time in any one direction, but stayed over the Clockum area, but they too then disappeared straight up into the sky. This event lasted for 3.5 minutes. It began approximately 15 seconds after midnight, and lasted until 12:04am January 1, 2014.   These were extremely large objects, and they were like nothing I have ever seen before. This is not the first UFO's the 3 of us have seen and reported.  This is however the first we have all seen together, and multiple UFO's at a time.  These objects moved like no aircraft we have ever seen.  The shape, lights, movement, all were very foreign.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
