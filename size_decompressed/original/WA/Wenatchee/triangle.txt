Huge silver ship passed slowly overhead, silently heading for impact with a mountain.  It simply vanished.;1979-08-15 22:00:00;7-8 seconds;Huge silver ship passed slowly overhead, silently heading for impact with a mountain.  It simply vanished. August 1979 Late evening XXXX ((deleted)) Street Wenatchee, WA, 98801   I was sitting on my front step just before full darkness facing due north when I happened to look up and saw an UFO passing directly overhead, traveling north.  The object appeared to be metallic silver in color, triangular in shape, basically flat underneath with clearly visible joints and rivets.  Also visible underneath were what appeared to be either lights or portholes lit from within.  Nothing was visible inside. The object was extremely large and appeared to be quite close.  A line of poplar trees to my left rose nearly 150’ from the ground and the object cleared them all, blocking out nearly the entire starlit sky. As for speed, the object was very slow. It took seven or eight seconds to disappear from view behind a row of trees across the street.  A jet liner could not have stayed airborne at such a sedate rate of speed.  I have seen 747’s up close in flight and this object was much larger and more massive.  There was no discernable fuselage, no wings or other protruding control devices evident. There was absolute silence, as the object passed overhead no sound whatsoever came from the ship nor did its passing disturb tree tops or leaves. My immediate thought was that a monstrous crash was imminent, as a significant natural obstacle lay in its path and without accelerating soon, that huge ship was going to plow into Birch Mountain, immediately north of the Wenatchee River. No crash occurred. The object, once out of my line of sight, for all intents and purposes, had simply vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  One of two excellent reports from same witness.  We know this witness, and have spoken with him on several occasions.  He formerly served in the U. S. military, and held a high security clearance.  We suspect that the report is an accurate representation of what he witnesses.  The witness has provided an excellent drawing of what the craft looked like, from his vantage on the ground, and as he looked to the north.  PD));47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
Amber objects in formation then breaking formation for several quick moves then back to formation.;1993-05-01 22:30:00;6 seconds;Amber objects in formation then breaking formation for several quick moves then back to formation. I don't remember the exact date it could have been 1992 or 1993.  I remember it was very warm that night,  so I would say it was late spring or early summer.  I walked out of my apartment to go to work.  I was looking east.  I noticed the sky was very clear and you could see all the stars perfectly, so naturally I was looking at the sky as I walked to my car.  I noticed a group of three lights come over the hill.  To those that know the area it seemed like they were about over Fancher Heights.  It seemed like they were pretty high.  They glowed what I call amber or orange like in color.  Having seen many planes fly over I'd say there speed was a lot faster than a plane.   Planes  take what seems like a full minute to go from horizon to horizon these or this took about  6 to 8 seconds. I say this because I don't know if it was one craft or three.  They flew in a perfect triangle shaped pattern all the way across the sky flying west.   When they got over the Saddle Rock horizon line they all of the sudden separated and then darted in and out and around each other.  Then just as quickly they formed the triangle shape they were in originally and kept going west over the hill.  What made me post this now in 2010 is a picture and video I just saw of the Phoenix lights, because it looked just like them.  The objects made no sound at all.

Stayed in one spot and then disapeared.;2013-07-23 22:40:00;15 minutes;stayed in one spot and then disapeared. The object was seen two different nights.  It was far away and stayed in one spot for twenty minutes.    At first I thought it was a star but then I started seeing colored lights.   Then I got my glasses and could see the colors easily.  Colors were red on top and white in the middle. the top was red.   I then left for about 10 minutes and when I came back it was gone.;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
Massive white light triangles floating over Wenatchee Valley from E to W.;2018-02-23 18:45:00;3-4 minutes;Massive white light triangles floating over Wenatchee  valley from East to West. Hello, At  6:45pm on February 23, 2018, I arrived at my home in Wenatchee, Wash., after having a music practice.  I went into my backyard, as I always do, and I looked up into the sky,  (I am a long time respected investigator/researcher, citizen scientist)  There was a light storm approaching from the West, with light broken clouds . I immediately noticed 2 white balls of light moving perfectly together (when I held my hand up they were about the length of my hand from light to light), but then I saw there was a third light forming a triangle and this was coming from the East over Badger Mountain and flew over me going West into the storm,   Then I noticed another one, 3 lights forming a massive triangle these were moving fairly slow but perfectly in unison with each other, then right next to it there was  another one and behind it another one, there were about 5 to 6 giant triangles that I saw  all moving together heading West over the twin peaks area,    I ran inside and grabbed my camera and tried to get a picture of the formation but could only get 2 lights in the pictures I took, when I zoom in on the lights there seems to be more than one object and   very strange forms . I look up into the sky every night and this is the first time I have seen these massive triangles over the Wenatchee area but I have also seen some very strange lights at out cabin on the summit of Badger Mountain and I saw a U.F.O. during the daylight while I was building our cabin and I reported it here   .;47.4193526737966;-120.295701069519
