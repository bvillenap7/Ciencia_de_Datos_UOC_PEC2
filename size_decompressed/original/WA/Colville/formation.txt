Cluster of red lights north east of colville, 8 or more, not flashing, and moving together but not in a steady formation.;2019-06-14 22:12:00;20 seconds;Cluster of red lights north east of colville, 8 or more, not flashing, and moving together but not in a steady formation. I was at the neighbors house, just stepped outside, at the base of a valley, surrounded by forests on all sides.  I look to the northern sky and notice what looked like a red blur at first appeared to be multiple red lights in the sky.  When I was looking at the lights, they appeared to be a couple of miles away and above the tree line.  There isn't any radio towers in that direction from where I live, and the objects did not flash at all.  To me they didn't seem to be making a symmetrical formation from where I was. My neighbor and I were talking and I interrupted her to show her the lights. I asked do you see that??  She said yeah the red lights up there?  So that confirmed to me that I wasn't just having an optical illusion/hallucination.  I've seen lights and strange behavior of lights in the night sky that I can't explain, but I haven't ever seen a cluster of red ones.;48.5769;-117.8602
