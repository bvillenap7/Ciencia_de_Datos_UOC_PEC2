Halogen like dual lights race across highway, taking 90 degree turn north.;1998-06-01 16:30:00;2 seconds;Halogen like dual lights race across highway, taking 90 degree turn north. I commuted daily from college in Spokane to my home in the northern part of the state for several years in the mid and late 1990's. I was driving about 2 miles north of Addy, a quarter mile north of south McClain road. The highway in this area is straight with a slight grade north, to the west is approximately a mile of open farmland, to the east a hill that abuts the McClain farmhouse, and small hills to the east and north of the farm. The sun had gone behind the hill to the west a few minutes before, the sky was clear and headlights were unnecessary. As I drove north I noticed two parallel lights approximately a quarter mile ahead, at perhaps 300 feet elevation. The lights were extremely bright, the brightest white light I had ever seen, with a slight blue tint-they looked exactly like halogens, though I had never seen a halogen at that time. They appeared to be separated by a hundred feet or so, but traveled exactly level in elevation and distance from one another. If you put a light on each wingtip of a jumbo jet, then erased the jet, this is how they appeared. They were about 6 times larger than lights you see on plane wings, more the size of round headlights. What I saw happened quickly. I noticed them first about a quarter mile to the left of the highway, they were moving extremely quickly, faster than a jet, yet slower than a meteorite. They flew exactly eastward and then turned a 90 degree angle north without losing speed. Everyone on the highway slammed on their brakes when this happened, so there were other witnesses. This happened approximately 60 miles north of Fairchild Airforce Base. I assumed it was a military excursion with a new secret weapon or aircraft.
