Fast moving ball of light with darker core, changed direction.;2002-08-28 22:00:00;20-45seconds;Fast moving ball of light with darker core, changed direction. I first sighted object approx 60 deg above SW horizon. Moving from south due north. I held out my forefinger and little fingers with thumb holding down middle two. AT arms length, the object traveled that distance in about 3-4 seconds which I measure to be 5.5 inches. I ran up into the house and grabbed the binoculars and out the back door, taking about 5 seconds..I relocated the object and had found that it had changed course a few degrees. Now a few degrees west. It was lined up with the end star of the rim of the Big dipper, I then  lost sight of it. The speed with which the object moved was something Im still have trouble with. I know it wasnt a falling star,commet or other naturally occuring Phenom. They dont usually make attitude corrections, nor move that fast. There were no lights of aircraft and no sound. I hope that others saw it,because my coworkers really think Ive lost it NOW.;48.5769;-117.8602
Small white light passing quickly across the sky, dropping, and disappearing after ~4 mins.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS over-flight?  PD));2013-10-17 20:00:00;4-5 minutes;A single small white light passing quickly across the sky, dropping in the sky, and disappearing after about 4 minutes. As I looked to the North, Northwest from Colville on a night with many stars and a nearly full moon lighting the clear black sky, I noticed a bright white light about 10 times the size of the average star, moving very quickly from west to east.  At one point it dropped instantly in the sky while keeping the same trajectory.   After  2-3 more minutes it disappeared abruptly.
