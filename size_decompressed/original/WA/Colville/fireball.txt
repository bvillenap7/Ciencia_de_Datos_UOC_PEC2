Jet breaking sound barrier folowed by a bright green fireball;1999-03-04 18:48:00;2 seconds;Jet breaking sound barrier folowed by a bright green fireball My wife had stopped by my place of work to meet me for my break.We stepped outside to have a cigarette. We heard a sudden sound of a jet breaking the sound barrier.(this is not very common in this area) I looked up in the sky facing north and said to my wife they are probably going to spray us (con-trails) at that instant the jet sound went away and I saw a brilliant green fireball shoot coming from the south to north, and from very high in the sky towards the ground and over north mountain range.It was partly cloudy and I could see it come in and out of the cloud cover, it lasted in my view about 2 seconds. This is the second green fireball I have seen in this area. In September I saw one in approximately the same place in the sky, except it came out of the east heading west and went over the horizon this was at dusk and it lasted about 3 seconds and was more parallel with the ground. Very awsome sight!!! Hope we can be of some help, and I appreciate all the hard work you do. I listen to Art every night and hear all the reports, just didn't think I would ever see anthing like this, now I have seen two. There is sure something to this, and with you and Art I believe we will find out someday. THANKS;48.5769;-117.8602
