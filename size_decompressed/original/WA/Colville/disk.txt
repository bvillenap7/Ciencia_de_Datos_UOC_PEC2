Spacecraft sighted over Washington State.;2010-09-04 09:30:00;2 minutes;Spacecraft sighted over Washington State. At around 9:30 on 9/4/2010, my wife and I just drove off from Jamminâ€™ Java in Colville, Washington. We noticed a metallic object about 50 miles east.   We watched the object for approximately 2 minutes before it disappeared.  When I mean disappeared, it turned the cloak system on to appear like it had disappeared.  I know that this object was not an airplane because, it sat hovering over the area in which it had been seen.;48.5769;-117.8602
