Smooth big bulb of light;2008-07-18 22:10:00;1min 30sec;Smooth big bulb of light I was out looking at the stars like I do from time to time, then from the corner of my left eye I saw a nice big bulb of light. It was low enough that I would have heard a sound if it was a plane of any kind or a helicopter of any kind. Low enough that I could tell if it had the red and green blinking light or any other color blinking lights like our aircrafts have. Not low enough for me to tell what kind of craft it was. It flowed smooth like, looking like it was coming down for landing then it went back up following the curve of the earth with the same speed, nice and smooth...then it just kept going up until the big bright bulb was a little red dot, then gone. It was low enough all so that I could make out if it was a satilite, I've never heard of a satilite orbiting low like what this bulb of light did. No sound, smooth the way the flight pattern was...couldn't go running in to get my camera to take a picture, could have been gone by the time I came back out is what I was thinking. So I just enjoyed what I was seeing, beeing around aircrafts...I knew that what I was looking at...or not what I was looking at.;48.7458;-118.0001
