Driving North on HWY 21, I noticed 2-3 orbs of orange lights in the sky, then disappeared quickly.   After turning W onto Coffee Pot Rd, I observed several of the same type of bright orange orbs of light, scattered in a line from my left to my right, around 12 in number.  Some shone brighter/whiter than others.  Having seen a few before on different occasions, I decided to try to take a picture.  As soon as I had my phone camera ready, they all disappeared.;47.3408;-118.7022
