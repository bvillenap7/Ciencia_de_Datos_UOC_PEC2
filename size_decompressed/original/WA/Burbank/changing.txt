White lights on inside, blue and red on outside I observed a large white ball of light coming very slowly in our direction. It was just north of the Horse Heaven Hills, near the confluence of the Walla Walla River and the Columbia. It looked as if it was coming from the direction of the Snake River. Sometimes the light would shift to gold. As it approached it appeared to be a large arrowhead shape with the underside of the craft covered in white lights with red and blue on the outside, like running lights on a plane, but going far too slowly for a plane, and the entire triangle was filled with lights. We were driving and didn't stop to observe more. Probably it was some kind of military aircraft.;46.1954;-118.9028
