When I was walking up my neighbor's driveway, I noticed something really strange.   I got my Dad from inside the house.  He brought the binoculars.  Both my Mom and Dad said that it looked like a triangle with red and white lights that kept blinking off-and-on.  It would turn totally black & then the lights would come back on.  I could not judge the distance up in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous  provides some contact information.  PD));47.8589;-121.7369
