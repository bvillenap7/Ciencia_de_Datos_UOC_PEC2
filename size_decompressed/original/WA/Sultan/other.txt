I took 29 photos with my Canon 30D, with a Canon 28-135mm f3.5 lens.   We saw nothing out of the ordinary, until I downloaded the pictures to the computer.   What we saw doesnâ€™t really make any sense to us.  The first evidence of something weird is on the 16th shot.  There is something blurry in front of or coming from behind the clouds.  For the next 14 shots, this image seems to change positions and directions.   The next shot (#30) is inside our house where I was showing my wife how to use the auto-focus on the camera.  The image is still there, but again, blurry, or a shadow.  I took 3 more shots inside the house at blank walls, & at a calendar on the wall.  No image.  There has been no alterations whatsoever of the shots, & they are still on the memory card in the camera.  There is nothing on the lens or the filter that would cause this.  We saw nothing in the sky.  We were basically in the same position on the deck, just turning around, looking at the clouds. I uploaded the shots to:  http://picasaweb.google.com/gholabird/2007_02_17;47.8589;-121.7369
