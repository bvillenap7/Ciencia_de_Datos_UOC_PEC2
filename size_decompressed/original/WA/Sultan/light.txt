It changed in color and was followed by a low boom noise minutes later. My friend and I were on a logging road approxiamatly 1.25 miles east of Cedar pond which is about 5 miles SE of Sultan, Washington. It was about 19:20, bright and sunny day, when we both noticed a very, very bright meteor like object traveling at a very high rate of speed towards the SE. We had a compass with us and took a bearing. We first saw the object  at around 155 and last saw it at 135.  I believe the object was 40-50 degrees above the horizon when we first saw it and about 20 when it disappeared behind a ridge. It may have actually sort of went, poof, right before it went behind the ridge. It changed color also as it traveled, I saw white, white-blue, green, orange. The event lasted about 2.5 seconds. It was extremely bright and comparable to the light created by a welder. It was actually very beautiful. About 3 to five minutes after witnessing the object, we heard a very low boom-like crack coming from the SE. It was definitly not gunfire or blasting. It upset many birds in the area. We witnessed about 25-30 ravens flying SE afterwards which seemed out of character, because the usually stay in pairs at lower elevations (from my experience). ((NUFORC Note:  Other reports submitted to the Snohomish County, Washington, 9-1-1 facility, and the Everett, WA, newspaper.  Apparently, the object may have been over the Cascade Mountains, or even east of there.));47.8589;-121.7369
Neon Green glowing ball falls on the Cascade Mountain Range near Sultan on Highway 2.;2004-08-18 21:10:00;4 seconds;Neon Green glowing ball falls on the Cascade Mountain Range near Sultan on Highway 2. I was sitting outside and all of the sudden I saw a neon green ball fall out of the sky. It was either glowing or flaming, and very bright. I was facing south, the object fell south-east, on the south side of Highway 2 over the mountains towards Eastern WA. It's hard to tell the size of it, but it was maybe 1000 square feet. I couldn't tell if it fell behind, in front, or on the mountains. There was no noise associated with it. It fell for about 3 or 4 seconds before it was out of site.;47.8589;-121.7369
Was feeding horses on 3 of July at dusk.  There was only one star in the SW sky noticable as the sun had not fully gone down. Neighborh;2005-07-03 21:45:00;1 min;Was feeding horses on 3 of July at dusk.  There was only one star in the SW sky noticable as the sun had not fully gone down. Neighborhood fireworks were starting to go off.  While I waited for my boyfriend to finish filling waters in the stalls I looked up at the single star and noticed another bright star moving quickly from the SW.  It was a solid bright light (brighter than the visible star) that appeared to be large, high, and moving very quickly. It thought that it was moving far too quickly to be an airliner and as it got closer, I noticed that there was no plane nor were there any flashing lights, and called to my boyfriend to come look- joking that I was seeing a UFO.  He stepped out of the barn, saw it immediatly, and we watched it as it was passing overhead.  It continued going NE through the sky and then made a slight curving arc toward the NNE, continuing in that direction until it passed out of our sight.;47.8589;-121.7369
