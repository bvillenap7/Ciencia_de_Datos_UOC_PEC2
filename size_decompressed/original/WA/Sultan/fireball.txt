7 fireball crafts flew overhead from north to south in Sultan, WA at 22:30 on July 4, 2010;2010-07-04 22:30:00;30 minutes;7 fireball crafts flew overhead from north to south in Sultan, WA at 22:30 on July 4, 2010 At approximately 22:30 on July 4, 2010, our group of seven adults and kids were out in the street enjoying local neighborhood fireworks.  The street we were on ran north and south. A red fireball appeared in the northern skies, directly north of us, and we initially thought that it was a flare someone had shot off.  The red fireball continued to fly overhead and to the south-south-east.  It was definitely flying lower than a commercial airliner but higher that a local police or news helicopter would be flying. Its altitude was more like what the local military jets fly.  Its flight speed was also similar to what U.S. jet would be.  Also, it did not emit any noticeable jet, propeller, or helicopter rotor sounds.  Once it was almost out of site, it appeared to increase altitude and head back northerly along the same path.  We then notice two additional red fireballs coming from the same northern location and travel along the same path as the first.  I ran into the hou! se to get my binoculars and viewed the crafts as small single balls of reddish light no other shape of the craft was apparent in the dark night sky.  One member of our party took two digital still pictures of one of the crafts with little to no enhancement by the limited zoom.  Before the end or the half hour encounter, four more craft individually traveled overhead from the north to the south.  All craft had the same attributes.  We did not stay out any longer than that due to our lack of fireworks and the night was very cold and windy.;47.8589;-121.7369
