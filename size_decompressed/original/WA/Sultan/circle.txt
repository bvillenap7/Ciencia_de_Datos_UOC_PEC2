I don't know the exact date or year. I'm 50 now so it was good long while ago but I do remember exactly what I saw.  Any way we where out camping some where around Sultan or Gold Bar Washington East of Monroe some where off of Hwy 2.  We were sleeping out under the stars.  I had gotten up some time during the night and went back and layed down in my sleeping bag looking at the sky through the trees.  From a northern direction I saw a silver disk of bright light.  It was a little smaller than the full moon but was the same kind of silvery light as the moon and was very high in altitude.  It was hard to gauge its speed or altitude but moved in a pretty much north to south direction at steady pace.  As I followed it with my eyes it instantly changed direction to a due east direction.  It didn't stop, slow down or curve as it changed direstion.  It was going south then it changed directions at perfenct 90 degree angle.  I know I wasn't asleep and I'm sure of what I saw.  It wasn't a plane, helicopter, satilite or any thing else. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));47.8589;-121.7369

A white ball type circle that would look like a star if it wasn't moving.  As I watched.. it stopped, then handed the binocular to my husband and he also saw the same ball/circle type of object continue moving East across the sky, at a very fast pace.   Then we didn't see it again. (this is my first time reporting, did not know about this site;47.8589;-121.7369
Color changing stationary light in the north east sky near Seattle.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of star, Capella, we suspect.  PD));2012-09-26 21:00:00;2 hours;Color changing stationary light in the north east sky near Seattle. At approximately 9:00pm, September 26, 2012, my son called me and his sister out to see a flashing object in the sky that had not moved for at least 10 minutes, at first he thought it might be a dying star.  I went out and witnessed an object that seemed to be flashing or maybe turning, alternating white, blue and red lights.   There was a smaller one to the north. the position of the large object was north east of Seattle. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of star, Capella, we suspect.  PD);47.8589;-121.7369
