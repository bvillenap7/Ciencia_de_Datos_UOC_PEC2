3 Orange UFO's;1982-06-01 06:00:00;10 minutes;3 Orange UFO's I was a young girl, many years ago. I lived in Sequim Washington way up in the mountains about 45 minutes out of town. I was standing on the side of the road waiting for the school bus just as I did every morning and from where I stood you could also see Victoria Canada. One morning as I stood staring off at Victoria I saw 3 very large oval orange glowing objects hovering over the water near Victoria, they then moved off to one direction together and stopped and then back to the opposite direction and stopped and then flew what seemed to be straight towards me and then straight up and disappeared. I have never forgotten that event and never will. That proved to me that we are NOT alone..I knew that it was not from this planet and I knew that it wasnt something normal just from the way that it flew back & forth.
