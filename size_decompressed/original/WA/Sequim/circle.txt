An object emitting lights when it became larger;2001-02-19 22:30:00;2245;An object emitting lights when it became larger Last night I went out on the south deck to get some fresh air prior to retiring, as I looked to the south, I saw an object (UFO ?) which seemed to turn red , blue and perhaps green.  It did not move and none of the other celestial objects were doing this. I did get my  camcorder and recorded the event on regular lens, and telephoto. This occurred between 2230-2245, and was still there when I went to bed. Weather: Clear Recording Device: JVC camcorder (VHS-C) ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at the star, Sirius, which is in the southern sky, approximately 30 degrees above the horizontal plane, at the time indicated.
