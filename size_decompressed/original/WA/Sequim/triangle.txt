Giant Triangle With Multi colored outlining lights.;2014-09-11 21:00:00;2 minutes;Giant Triangle With Multi colored outlining lights. I was looking at the stars outside before i went to bed, like i usually do.  I looked towards the mountains behind my house and i seen  about 7 multi colored lights, green being the most prominent outlining a giant triangle.   I would say its altitude would be about 3000 ft and it was heading N-NNE.   As it flew over above i started to hear jet engines in the distance and it sounded like something was moving fast towards the direction of the Craft.   I am familiar with aircraft this was not a 747.;48.0872;-123.1146

It had 5 lights they were a light faded green color and the lights were large in size.  The lights formed the triangle but all sides weren't equal length.  The bottom or back was half the length of the 2 sides.
