The sky was heavily overcast and it was raining at the time no stars of any kind were visible in the sky. It moved slowly like a plane, but the light was too bright and the wrong color to have been one.  As I watched it move, it began to “shed” and trail red/orange light (such as a rocket or “willow” style firework).  It continued to move at the same speed, but with more sloughing off and trailing of red/orange light until it finally disappeared.;48.0872;-123.1146
