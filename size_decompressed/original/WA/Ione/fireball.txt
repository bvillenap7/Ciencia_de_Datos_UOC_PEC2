Redish-Orange object falling ne to sw in souther sky south of Sullivan Lake, Ione, Wa;2011-01-18 22:07:00;1.5 seconds;Redish-Orange object falling ne to sw in souther sky south of Sullivan Lake, Ione, Wa On 20110118 at approximately 22:07 (Pacific Time) while looking south-south west from a location just south of Sullivan Lake (NE of the town of Ione, WA) I observed what most likely was a Meteor passing from the north east to the south west.  The object went just below the three stars on Orion's belt downward at about a 45 degree angle.  The object was left a reddish-orange streak in the sky.  I make this report even though it probably was a meteor just to help document this UFO.;48.7413;-117.4114
