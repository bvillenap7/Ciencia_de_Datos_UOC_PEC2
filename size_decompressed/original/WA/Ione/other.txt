An object that appeared to be a satellite, but changed course and speed repeatedly.;2015-07-03 22:30:00;30 minutes;An object that appeared to be a satellite, but changed course and speed repeatedly. On the evening of July 3rd, at about 10:30 PM, I was outside, looking up at the stars, as I enjoy doing, when I noticed what I initially thought was a satellite moving across the sky. The “satellite” then changed course and began to move around irregularly. It would move in loops and swirls, staying in one general area, changing velocity occasionally.  Every now and then I could see a faint shimmering in the area and would sometimes see what looked like another “satellite” moving in a similar fashion, but only for a second or two and then disappear.  At one point the object turned red for 2 or 3 seconds then returned to normal. At one point I saw something flash out in my peripheral vision.  It was like a shooting star/ meteor moving towards the original object, yet this “meteor” only moved at the speed of a satellite, much slower than a meteor.   About 10 seconds later I saw another “meteor,” also moving towards the original object, but from a different direction. I don’t know what I saw but it looked to me like it was a craft involved in some sort of combat with other craft.  I was 70 miles or more from any city of any size, the night was quiet.  I do not know what it was but I can tell you what is wasn’t:  an airplane, a helicopter A Satellite, Swamp Gas, A Weather Balloon, Venus.   I am curious if anyone else has seen something like this.;48.7413;-117.4114
Bright object moves west to east above Jupiter.;2018-08-05 21:30:00;45 seconds;Bright object moves west to east above Jupiter. Was viewing Jupiter thru 30 power scope on total station. I saw a bright white light about as bright as Jupiter and tracked it for a while as it headed  west to east (heading was about about 90 to 110 degrees).   Last seen thru scope angle was 203d 21' 54, elevation 27d 13' 11 (from my location at 48d, 46' 58.1, -117d 17' 16.5, ne of Ione WA).   Object did not have any flashing navigation lights and I went outside to listen for sound and could hear nothing, no wind.   It traversed my field of view about 5 degrees west and above jupiter to the hill to my south east in perhaps less than 35~45 seconds.;48.7413;-117.4114
