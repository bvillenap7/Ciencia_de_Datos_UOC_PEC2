July 4, 2012 We were waiting to see fireworks on Fox Island.   Someone said that those in the sky will really be a big display when they go off however, the orange fireballs or spheres just kept coming closer , moving from the west to the south.  One was further ahead of the other and I watched them while they were rising upwards and then out of sight.   An air traffic controller was the first to spot them and said he didn't have a clue of what they were. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
