Two UFO's in sky.;2012-07-14 21:30:00;3 minutes;Two UFO's in sky. We saw a red and yellow light in lead with a yellow light in echelon formation to the right of the red and yellow light.  We noticed it approximately at 1000 feet AGL flying east over Airway Heights, Washington, at approximately 50-70 kts. and turned south and increased altitude to approximate 6000-1000 feet AGL.  Increased speed to approximately 200-500 kts and disappeared out of sight.   At first they appeared to look light floating lanterns, and then ascended like helicopters with no sound.  The red one went up thought the clouds and disappeared.  The yellow one appeared to maneuver through the hole in the clouds to get to altitude and then disappeared out of sight to get to altitude. Three of us witnessed the sighting together.;47.6474;-117.5894
