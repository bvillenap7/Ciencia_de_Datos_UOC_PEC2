Bright yellow object that cast light on cloud cover above it and was a disk or saucer shape.;2013-10-15 21:45:00;~5:00 minutes;Bright yellow object that cast light on cloud cover above it and was a disk or saucer shape. I was out on my back porch smoking and searched the sky as I always do for any activity and as I was doing so I noticed a bright light coming from the SW.  The light was bright yellow and was the color of the object.   After a few minutes it climbed  slowly and lit up a small area of the cloud cover above it.  The cloud cover was actually marine overcast.  It was at this time that the object had a clear outline, it was a saucer or disk shape.   I could not see any dome or other appendage on the ufo.   Once it entered the cloud I saw it briefly one more time and it was gone.  The ufo was traveling in the same direction NE.  I listened for engine noise but never heard anything.   I had to delay in reporting this because of my computer had malfunctioned.   It is ok to contact me if needed.;48.9636;-122.7323
