Observer 2 is retired RN. At approximately 19:30 on 11/12/98 observers were in garage with door open looking north at wind and rain storm passing through area.  They observed a brilliant green flash lasting about 1 second that seemed to come from the south behind garage and lit up the entire sky.  Unknown whether source of light was close by or far away but no explosion was heard.  Second identical flash occurred about 10 seconds later coming from same direction.  Light had color of copper vapor laser.  Observers thought some kind of electrical transformer may have shorted out in the storm but power was not lost.  However, on returning inside they discovered cable T.V. was lost for one hour.  Also, our computer and a neighbor's both turned on by themselves and stayed on all night as if the screen saver had been lost on both of them.;48.9636;-122.7323
