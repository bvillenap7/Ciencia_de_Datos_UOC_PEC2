They were travelling in same direction at first which approximately would have been coming from the water of Birch Bay and moving slowly inland.  I'm guessing from northwest and head in slowly towards east.   They were too far apart to be any headlights on a plane, and I thought to myself, that planes don't fly that distance together- not commercial anyway.  I saw them clearly.  They weren't planets or stars.  They weren't laser pointers or search lights. There were many grey clouds in sky but the orange lights were easy to see.   After they traveled in same direction, they then changed courses and went into the clouds - no longer going in same direction.  They did not descend.   At about that time I wondered if they were UFO's and went into my house.   Minutes later I heard at least one helicopter, went to my window and watched helicopter flying in near same area of sky.   I think it was my first UFO sighting.   Birch Bay, Blaine WA  8.29.2014 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));48.9636;-122.7323
