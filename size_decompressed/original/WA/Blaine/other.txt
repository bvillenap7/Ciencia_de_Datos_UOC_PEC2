I take pictures in my back yard all the time at night.  The night of December 1, 2011, I got a feeling to take this picture as I thought something was there inmy back yard I couldn't see.  As it turns out i was able to capture a craft of some kind coming over the trees half materialized and glowing.  It seems to me that it is half in our dimension and half in what other dimension it is coming from.  I have the picture if anyone is interested in seeing it for themselves.;48.9636;-122.7323
