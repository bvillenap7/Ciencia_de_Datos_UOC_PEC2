Orange lights over Drayton Harbor;2012-06-30 23:30:00;2 minutes;Orange lights over Drayton Harbor As I walked to my back yard I noticed a orange light floating seeming over Drayton Harbor.  I thought it was a fireworks flare someone shot but it did not burn out just started to come my way.  I ran to get my camera on tripod and was glad it was still there when I came back.  I focused in on it and caught a few seconds of it before my camera went out of focus as it climbed into the clouds and out of sight. The strangest thing which I did not notice until I viewed the film, was a light similar to the one that I had centered in the film is off to the right lower corner of the frame.  Thing is I was trying to zoom in on the center light just as it went out of focus, but the light in the right hand corner stays constant and even quickly moved out of frame just after the main light moves up into the cloud and up and over the city.  It was about 11:30 pm on June 30,2012 just a few minutes ago.  It doesn't seem I explained enough what seems strange to me, what I mean to get across is how can the light in the right hand corner stay constant when I am zooming in on the center object.  Seems to me it should go out of focus just as the center object did.  Then strangely enough it moves out of frame with the characteristics of a ufo.;48.9636;-122.7323
Small, colorful, flashing light.;2013-09-26 04:26:00;45 minutes;Small, colorful, flashing light. I was staying the night with a friend in late August and it was 4:26am.  When I went out for a cigarette, I seen a small light in the sky that was flashing in many different colors.  It stayed in the same spot for the 45 minutes I stayed outside and watched it.  It was gone by the next time I stepped outside (about 30min later).   It looked uncommon enough to impress my friends and family so I took a 45-second long video to show off what I had seen(not fully convinced myself of it being a ufo).   Thinking back on how odd this light was and seeing all the colors in the video have me thinking twice.;48.9636;-122.7323
