Disc follows fighter jets to air base.;1988-10-15 13:00:00;2 minutes;Disc follows fighter jets to air base. This sighting occurred in October of 1988 on south 58th Street in Tacoma, WA.   I had descended my front stairs while watching a pair of F-15 Fighter jets heading into Mc Chord AFB on approach.  Outside of the rear aileron of the outside jet was a disc that was brassy in color, thin and 3-4 feet in diameter.  I doubt if the pilots were aware of it.  The sky was broken clouds with partial sun.  The jets were several hundred feet off the ground and traveling about 250 mph.  As they passed above me, the disc broke off and headed in a south easterly direction towards Mount Rainier.  I mentally attempted to convey my interest in having it come back.  It did. It circled around and parked itself above a telephone pole across the street. I was terrified.  I felt like I was being mentally raped.   After about 30 seconds, it headed due north at a blistering rate of speed.   This sighting has not been a subject of a specific regression.   I am not aware of anyone else that saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

AT ABOUT 22:00 WE NOTICED (AS DID SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE THERE)  A RED CIRCLE HOVERING JUST IN THE CLOUD LAYER. THERE WERE TWO SEMI-CIRLCE LIGHTS ON THE OBJECT AND THEY FLASHED AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES. THE OBJECT HOVERED FOR ABOUT A MINUTE, THEN IT MOVED THROUGH THE CLOUD LAYER TO HOVER CLOSER. AFTER A FEW SECONDS IT BEGAN TO MOVE OFF SLOWLY TO THE WEST. WHILE IT WAS STILL ON THE WESTERN HORIZON (ABOUT 1 MINUTE LATER) TWO FIGHTER TYPE AIRCRAFT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY FROM EAST TO WEST ON APPEARENTLY THE SAME COURSE AS THE CIRCLE OBJECT.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
observed a circular shaped bright, almost floresent, light green, with some white colored light shoot across part of sky.;1999-10-03 21:41:00;one half second;observed a circular shaped bright, almost floresent, light green, with some white colored light shoot across part of sky. Location: 7100 block of east L street, tacoma, wa. Looking south south west.   Observed a very small, light green (almost floresent)in color, with some white spots, circular shaped light, shoot across a small portion of sky, disappearing over the horizon. When first observed, it appeared to be about 15 degrees above the horizon, almost straight south (slightly west) of my location. Size:  Extending my arm straight out in front of me, fingers pointed upward, it appeared to be about half the size of my small fingernail. The light appeared to be an object only in that it appeared to have a clearly defined border (inotherwords, it was not hazy at the edges). It appeared to be moving from northeast to southeast in direction, traveling in a straight line, dissappearing from my sight due to rooftops at about 10 degrees above horizon. It also appeared to be loosing altitude.  But this appearence may be due to its speed and direction of travel, in relation to my stationary location. Extending my arm out in front of me, while holding a ruler, it traveled 4 to 5 inches while dropping about 2 and a half inches. The entire event lasted only about a half of a second.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

Strange white silent hovering lights near Commencement Bay;2017-03-12 19:45:00;~10 minutes;Strange white silent hovering lights near Commencement Bay We were walking down Borough Road by Garfield Park to our car.  My daughter saw 3 hovering lights, white with red and blue and thought it was an airplane but wondered why they were silent and hovering so low, plus too small to be full sized airplanes, but very bright lights.   The group of 3 were in a tighter formation at first.  There were more bright white lights hovering lower on the horizon by the water,  Commencement Bay Puget Sound.  We notice 9 lights and actually noticed 11 in one photo, almost as though they were meeting at the spot we saw the first 3, making a formation of some kind.  I got my phone to get pictures.   They stayed bright white and spread out, then disappeared, most moved upward into the clouds, a few sideways, probably hovering for close to ten minutes.    This was about 7:45 PM, Sunday, March 12th in Tacoma, WA..  We have no idea what these were.  I'm glad we got photos. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Thank you for your reply and information.  I looked at photos online of Chinese lanterns and don't believe that is what we saw as the objects seemed too mechanical and the movement seemed too deliberate but hovering rather than floaty, if that makes sense.  Plus they seemed larger than the photos of Chinese lanterns.  They were coming from the horizon.  I looked at the map for this area and noticed a Tacoma city park on the water called the Fuzhou Ting at Chinese Reconciliation Park.  I called to ask if they allow Chinese lanterns and if any were lit last night.  It seems Chinese lanterns are illegal in Seattle so I would assume most likely in Tacoma, too.  I am waiting to hear back from someone at the Parks Department to verify.  Being it is so chilly and rained earlier in the day, I doubt there were any weddings at the Fuzhou Ting Park. I am wondering if there is some kind of military goings on with the nearby JBLM.  I looked up pictures of drones but these seemed too large to be a drone, at least what photos you can find online.  I also tried to reach the Tacoma Tribune but no one has replied as well as the local Fox KCPQ affiliate.  I couldn't find anything online reporting lights in the sky.  It was all very strange, we could not stop watching it.   I can't believe my Galaxy 5.6 phone was able to capture what it did since the photos are no where near the brightness and clarity of what we actually saw.  We were thinking how could you not notice this but this road is quiet and with the trees and terrain, we were in the perfect spot to see what we did.  I was hoping the Fox KCPQ might show the pictures and others might come forward if they saw it but they must not be interested.   I will submit to the online report form as soon as I get an answer from the Tacoma Parks Department about the Chinese lanterns.  The person who handles that venue is out until the 22nd so hopefully the other person I left a message with will call me back tomorrow.  I will also see if there is some way to get information from the City of Tacoma about people calling in about those lights. I looked up some videos on youtube and these lights look like what others have seen, too.     Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter, I did not hear back from anyone I left messages with.  However, I found an information bulletin from the Tacoma Fire Department that says there are no permits allowed for any kind of incendiary releases or sky lanterns.  I would assume a Tacoma City Park nearby would not be allowed to release lanterns. These lights that we saw look like some I found on you tube such as the ones in Missouri in 2012 and in Arlington, Texas, June 2015, in the International Business Times.  It's very strange and I also find it odd the media I tried to contact have zero interest.  You would think they would at least show the pictures to say what it is or isn't and talk about the safety of Chinese lanterns, etc... or at least verify if JBLM ((Joint Base Ft. Lewis/McChord AFB)) was doing testing of some kind or whatever they want to say it is.  I don't think it's either lanterns or drones based on what I could compare it with on the internet.     I just submitted the form on the website. The photos are in the email I sent.    Thank you, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #2));47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
