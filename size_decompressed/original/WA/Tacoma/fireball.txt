It was a large RED FIRE BALL, the size was four times bigger than her fist (with arm out) and it hovered over the area (she assumes would be over the North part of the Port of Tacoma, went to get Dad- came back it was gone.  She has always been a sceptic of these things - can't believe her eyes. Says over and over it was a huge red fire ball and just hovered in the sky over the sound. same info as above.   My mother is 66 yrs old and has been married for 48 yrs and does not see things, a very old-fashion up to date type of person - very truthful.  When she did see this, it appeared as a dot and grew in size as if approaching her way (it was heading south)from the north (looking towards Point Defiance - from her view)She lives next to the fairway of Highland Hill Golf Course, so she had a good view of the sky.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

I would say that the object may have broken up as it fell because a  smaller fireball or two seemed to come out of the main fireball.  This object  appeared very large or very close.  I've seen many meteorites during my 54  years and if thats what this was, it was a big one.  ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports for this time and date.

Our son brought to our attention what he called a falling star. My wife, older son and my self looked up into the sky, to see what appeared to be an object (fireball) in the South Western sky. It appeared, to be traveling in a south westerly direction, on a re-enrty path. It was obviously generating quite a bit of heat as it was producing, an orange glow and contrails. It turned rather sharpley to the west as it was decesending, and contiued in a westerly direction. It seemed that the contrails split apart 2-3 minutes after it turned. The turn that it made was very quickly executed as though it almost turned at a right angle. This didn't appear to be a normal aircarft turn as it was done at high rate speed. We continued to watch it until it dissapeared behind a cloud bank. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the time here to 1915 hrs., which was the correct time of the sighting.

Fireball over Tacoma Wa.;2010-03-05 00:20:00;2 minutes;Fireball over Tacoma Wa. I witnessed a gently pulsating (~4 Second Intervals) orange light/fireball moving due north over Tacoma, Washington at a constant angle of about 70 degrees above the western horizon.  Though I could not judge the distance or altitude well, the “apparent and relative” speed and size was like that of a landing light from a military airplane or the International Space Station at it’s brightest passing overhead.  It was noticeably brighter and slightly larger than a planet or bright star but I noted no atmospheric aberration giving the sensation that it was a small object moving by at a close distance (a few hundred feet away).  This struck me as bizarre because my logic dictated that the object, like an aircraft at that motion, should be a mile or two away.  At one point, the object began to slowly undulate and decelerated to a stop within about five seconds, then emitted an apparently solid “column” of light from the bottom.  The light column did not continue ! downward to the ground, but ceased in mid-air about two to three degrees below the object.  Also, this emitted light was shimmering with several colors (ie. Purple, green, white), and was minor in magnitude in comparison to the luminosity of the main object body and was relatively difficult to see clearly.  After about ten seconds, the light column and fireball disappeared and in it’s place began a bright white and random strobe pattern.  The object then accelerated to the north again, achieving extremely high apparent speed until it disappeared from view down near the north horizon.  (I had just enough time to run upstairs from my south side downstairs porch to see the last few seconds of it passing into the distance from my north-facing second-story kitchen window).  I also noted that the light portion of the blinking interval cycle was very fast or “instantaneous” compared with strobe lights that I had seen before this.  Total U.F.O. observation time was about two minute! s, and lastly, there was no noticeable sound coming from the o! bject th roughout the sighting.  I have lived near a major US Air Force base my entire life and have spent 34 years around many different aircraft of which I feel that I have become very familiar.  This object, which I only passively noticed far in the distance from the corner of my eye, very quickly struck me as odd and out of place.  I had a strong feeling that this object, if not a human-piloted or controlled craft, definitely exhibited signs of intelligence or intelligent control, possibly even aware of my observing it.  I was transfixed throughout the sighting and found the experience beautiful, fascinating, unsettling, and frightening.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

Red-orange slow moving fireball, inconsistent speed, moving north to south, dimming and finally going out.;2012-07-27 22:00:00;90 to 120 seconds;Red-orange slow moving fireball, inconsistent speed, moving north to south, dimming and finally going out. My wife (educator), daughter (nine years old) and I (technical writer) arrived home at Dash Point, WA between 9:30 and 10:00pm on July 27th, 2012.  The sky was mostly dark already, with just a trace of dusk light near the horizon and the moon (a bit more than half) rising in the south over the top of Indian Hill in Northeast Tacoma.  No house or yard lights were on when we arrived home. As we got out of the car (all car lights off) I noticed a bright reddish-orange light off to the Northeast, moving roughly from North to South.  We see a lot of air traffic over Seatac from our home in Northeast Tacoma, but what caught my attention was the obvious fact that this was not an airplane.  The light was neither blinking nor steady, but looked most like the fireball flickering of shooting stars I’ve seen in the past.  But there were many aspects of this object that were unlike any shooting star I've ever seen.  First, the speed at which the light moved across the sky was MUCH slower than any shooting star I’ve ever seen before.  The speed was also inconsistent.  At times it moved at about the speed of a distant/high aircraft, then it appeared to slow down, then to speed up again, all the while moving in the same direction.  As it moved southward, the brightness of the object was also variable, sometimes getting brighter, sometimes dimmer.  This variation in brightn! ess appeared to be a change in the object itself and not the effect of any clouds between us and the object. The color was also unusual, that being an intense reddish-orange. Most shooting stars I've seen in the past were whitish, bluish or greenish in color. As we watched, the object continued to move to the south, until after a minute or so, it gradually began to grow steadily dimmer and dimmer.  A few seconds after the dimming began, what had looked like a fireball took on the appearance of a bright ruby-red point of light, continuing to grow dimmer until it finally winked out completely, much as you might see when a glowing bit of firework cools and goes dark.  As the object grew dimmer, it also appeared to slow down. The motion of the object the entire time was roughly in a straight line from north to south.  While the speed and brightness of the object varied, the direction didn’t seem to change. I’ve seen thousands of aircraft at night, I’ve seen dozens of shooting stars, I’ve seen a couple of comets, and I’ve seen reflected sunlight off the passing International Space Station and a couple of orbiting space shuttles.  This didn’t look quite like ANY of those.  In terms of the brightness and nature of the light, this looked most like a fireball shooting star, but most like a distant satellite in terms of its slow speed, except that the speed seemed to vary, sometimes nearly stopping. I have a theory, but that’s all it is.  It might have been a satellite falling out of orbit and breaking up.  This would seem to explain a) why it moved in a relatively straight line, b) why it moved slower than any shooting star I’d ever seen, and c) why it initially appeared as a fireball in the sky and not the steadier reflection of light off a coherent satellite or spacecraft, but then grew dimmer and dimmer and finally winking out.  But that’s just my best guess.  The whole thing took about 90 to 120 seconds from when we first noticed it the light to when the object went completely dark.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

It was dark, there was no wind and it was a completely clear sky.  He called for me to grab my phone and come out to the deck to 'take a look at something'.   When I got on the deck I witnessed a red/orange fireball in the sky moving very fast and smooth towards us (Southbound).  The object never changed speed, never change direction and never changed color or brightness.  The object was moving faster than a commercial plane and was very set in its course. After it passed over us, we noticed some type of debris falling from its path in the sky.  Due to the darkness it was very hard to see detail, but the falling object was round or ovoid in shape and was falling at a fairly slow, smooth pace. I was able to get 15-20 seconds of video of the fireball with my iPhone which does a great job representing speed, shape, brightness, path, as well as the conditions of the evening.   This is DEFINITELY something I have never seen before!;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Red and orange fireball shaped craft moving south in a smooth fast manner.;2013-08-20 20:45:00;~2 minutes;Red and orange fireball shaped craft moving south in a smooth fast manner. I saw an object moving from north to south at a considerable speed on Tuesday August 20th 2013.   Sitting on my deck in North Tacoma at approximately 8:45 pm when I saw what appeared to be a fireball shaped object heading my direction from the north at an approximate 50 degree angle in the sky.  The object covered a 180 degree span from first seeing it to the point of it trailing off in the distance.  The entire event was about two to three minutes.  The object was approximately 1/6th to 1/8th the size of a full moon, which we are close to having this evening.   The skies were clear and we are used to observing aircraft in the sky in all light conditions.  This was definitely something very unique and absolutely not a play on the sunset which had already passed, or the lights from an approaching aircraft.  In addition there was no sign at all of any blinking lights throughout the entire sighting and as I previously stated we watched it come toward us, pass us,! and trail off in the distance.  I thought it might be a plane on fire when I first saw it but as it neared and passed it was obvious that was not the case.  It looked like a fire ball which included various shades of red and orange.  We did observe a piece of debris fall from the sky near a radio tower and drove over to investigate.  We did not find anything.  This debris was sizable and falling at a fairly slow rate but not as slow as a piece of paper or material of that kind.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
