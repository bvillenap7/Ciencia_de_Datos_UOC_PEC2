Five lights moved in unison from NW to SE across the Tacoma sky at night.;2016-08-12 02:45:00;5-10 seconds;Five lights moved in unison from NW to SE across the Tacoma sky at night. While watching the night sky looking for shooting stars from the Perseid meteor shower, my wife and simultaneously observed 5 lights in a slight chevron formation moving quickly from NW to SE.  The lights moved in exact unison like a single aircraft but the chevron was very large and there was no audible noise. We live in the flight path of both SEA-TAC airport and McChord Air Force Base so we see multiple aircraft every day and night flying overhead.  This group of lights did not resemble any aircraft we have ever seen nor did it move at the speed of any aircraft we have seen in this area.  The lights at no time left a streak and did not blink or twinkle at any time.  They remained constant and solid until out of view. We cannot say whether it was a single aircraft with five lights or if the chevron was five separate objects moving in unison.  However, the five lights never moved closer or further apart as they moved across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be quite sober-minded.   We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
