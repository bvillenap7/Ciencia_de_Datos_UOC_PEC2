Fast object like meteor across right side of me two times, one time to my left slowly.;2009-08-01 10:08:00;3-4 mniutes;Fast object like meteor across right side of me two times, one time to my left slowly. On August 1, I saw an object go across the night sky at a high speed, to my right. I was at my friend's house, looking out the window. Then It came back into view and went slowly to my left, about as fast as an conventional aircraft. Then the craft once again zoomed across the night sky, to my right. I decided to tell nobody, because they may of thought I was imagining nothings [though I don't].  There was also no sound.  I guess it probably was about a kilometer away.
