The sky was partly sunny, the sun had broken through the clouds when a fast moving shadow, as if something was passing between us and the sky, but without the sound one would expect to hear from a plane or aircraft flying over.  I looked out from underneath the boat canopy and saw a translucent object somewhat oval/diamond shaped that refracted the light as in having the appearance of reflecting the surrounding sky.  It was in the open sky and traveling from north to south for approximately one minute, before dissapearing into the clouds. I would calculate the speed as near 300 miles per hour. I am convinced that this object is not one of ours, having lived here my entire life and having seen all aircraft types in the McCord Airforce Base area. I would say the the object was cloaked. The closest thing to the appearance of this object I have ever witnessed was the visual immagery used to create the creature in the movie Predator.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Sighted from a Cessna C206 by 20,000 hour pilot and passengar.  Bright as the sun, very unusual sighting.  See full description;2000-04-18 11:32:00;five minutes;Sighted from a Cessna C206 by 20,000 hour pilot and passengar.  Bright as the sun, very unusual sighting.  See full description At 1132 PDT on 3/18/00 while flying a cessna C206 at 5,500' on a heading of 155 magnetic, approximately between Bremerton and Tacoma, WA airport, we sighted an extremely bight light with an intensity approaching that of the sun at about our 12:30 to 1:00 position. The haze layer top was about 4,000' and this light appeared to be below the haze layer top.  It was judged to be south of Fort Lewis Army base but north of the hills south of Fort Lewis.  Sky conditons were clear and unlimited visibility above the haze layer.  We initially thought it to be light reflected from a metal roof but the light stayed in the same relative position making that unlikely.  I held my thumb to the light and was able to block it out but the size of the light must have been very large as I judged it to be many miles away.  After a couple of minutes another light appeared over and separated from the large round light.  This was a more flat or crescent shape, roughly the same diameter as the round light.  I attempted to call Tacoma Tower to ask if they had it in sight but they did not answer.  Due to airspace restrictions I had to descend to pass over the southern tip of Vashon Island.  In the descent, at about 4,500' the light suddenly disappeared. I have been a pilot for 47 years, military and civilian with over 20,000 flying hours.  I have not seen a similar event during that time and judge this to be out of the limits of anything I have noted during those flying hours. I did not have a camera with me so have no photos. The intensity would be similar to White Phosphorus burning but in this sighting, no sign of drifting or descending as a white Phosphorus shell or flare  would exhibit so I ruled that out.  The intensity was near that of the sun. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date to 18AP00.  We have made correction here.  PD));47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

black, worm-shaped object drifting northwest just below cloud level at 16:45 on October 8.;2000-10-08 16:45:00;15 minutes;black, worm-shaped object drifting northwest just below cloud level at 16:45 on October 8. i am a student at the university of puget sound and i was sitting at the kitchen table in our house in the north end of tacoma working on homework.  i looked out the kitchen window and saw a fleck in the sky that looked like the mark on a photographic enlargement when lint has been left on the negative.  i went out onto our back porch and watched a black, matte object drift silently closer.  it slowly changed shape as it moved (at about the same speed as the clouds) from south to northeast.  its form was constant, a tube shape (ROUGH estimate) perhaps about thirty feet in length that gradually changed shape from a 'u' to almost a ninety degree angle to a long, flat shape with one end sticking up.  it was probably at least one foot in diameter, or as big around as a basketball (also very ROUGH guess).  at one point, when most of it was flat and one end was sticking up, it looked like the fuselage and vertical stabilizer of a plane's silhouette and i thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me.  however, as the object got closer, it continued to change shape.  it was drifing along, made no noise and didn't perceptibly change height.  i estimated that it was floating at about the same height a small, private plane would cruise, but soon after, a small, single-engine plane flew below it and i realized that it was half-again that high.  it looked like a long, black water worm (long, styrofoam flotations toys kids use in pools) that was being manipulated by the breeze to form different shapes.  i only saw one object and watched it for about 15 minutes before it disappeared (either into the clouds or from distance i couldn't tell).;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
UFO observed visiting several homes in my neighborhood;2001-03-22 03:30:00;2 hours;UFO observed visiting several homes in my neighborhood Had been hearing a distinctive humming for a couple months prior to the sighting. On the night in particular we turned off the lights pretending to go to bed but stayed quietly inside observing out the windows. At around 3:30am we began to hear the hum, but then it changed into the sound of a small aircraft. I then observed white lights just above the trees at the side of the house circling over the tree-tops. It made at least 6 circles. We then opened the back door to look at the 'airplane' when it suddenly turned on very bright white lights and slowly moved toward the back behind our home and went down about 2 blocks behind us in the neighborhood. It later appeared to approach our house from the back direction when it suddenly began flashing lights all over the craft and turned slightly to my left and came down at a house on our street about 1 block away. At approximately 5am I had gone to bed but the other 2 witnesses observed the craft right over our house, it was straight above their heads, then it appeared to go straight up until it looked like just another star. It was a black cylinder shape with two round appendeges on either side which appeared to rotate with lights on them. The back end of the cylinder appeared to open and close with the thrumming of the sound and when open the inside could only be described as having 'liquid' light. We got a camcorder the next day, and saw it that night but at a distance and attempted to capture it on video, and though it doesn't look like a normal aircraft the video isn't that definative. I think this is important and needs to be shared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness includes photographs of object, apparently fabricated out of which paper.  It looks somewhat like a BOMARC missile.  We will attempt to post the photograph.  PD));47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

UFO- Bright, light shifting Orb over Tacoma 8/11/2007;2007-08-11 13:24:00;4 minutes;UFO- Bright, light shifting Orb over Tacoma 8/11/2007 On August 11, 2007 at approx 1:24pm, I was standing outside the Red Lion in Tacoma near S. 84th Street waiting for a limo to transport me to a club where I was mixing sound for Digital Underground.  I looked up into the clear blue sky and saw a very bright orb, approx the size of a pea held at arm’s length.  The object appeared to be a few miles away depending on the size of the object.  The light being emitted was brighter than anything I have ever seen- somewhat like a flashbulb that was on continually.  After a few seconds, the color shifted to a dark charcoal black with a halo ring around the perimeter.  The black was unlike anything I can describe.  Much darker than black itself…. Very unusual. The object moved slowly from West to East in the sky and kept switching from black to very bright.  I noticed a group of three men standing nearby and asked them what they thought it could be.  One replied that’s a balloon, and they went on talking and ignoring the object.   The orb began to move up into the heavens and get smaller.  By the time my ride arrived, I could still see it at a great distance but I could only see when it was bright, not black.  This was no balloon, not a military aircraft that I could identify (McCord AFB is nearby).  It certainly was not a helicopter or plane.  It is very difficult to describe the intensity and nature of the bright glow and the charcoal black.  I am certain that this was an unusual object that cannot be identified by any means of conventional wisdom, making it a UFO.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

I was sleeping when I heard a two distinct noises coming from outside. I at first thought it was a machine or traffic, until it wouldn't stop and I decided to get out of bed.  I peered out my window to see two christmas bell shaped lit objects in the sky approximately a mile or so from my home.  As I was watching the objects in the sky they began to move toward my home in a hovering type motion. The noise continued the entire time this was occuring. I wasn't able to see the craft(s) only the lights.  It moved over the top of my house and I was unable to see them but was still able to hear it.

Large black insect-shaped craft hovering above the city of Tacoma, Wa.;2014-06-02 11:00:00;Unsure;Large black insect-shaped craft hovering above the city of Tacoma, Wa. I was driving home from an appointment in Gig Harbor with my mother when we both noticed, almost out of nowhere, a large matte black, M-shaped/Crab-shaped object in the sky.  The craft looked like something out of Battlestar Galactica or kind of like a large insect hovering barely above the buildings that we were heading towards.  	We both thought it was a plane until I realized there was absolutely no noise and it was at a very strange angle for something in the air.  The craft moved back and fourth from left-right a few times.   I don’t remember what happened after that, can't recall if it flew away, disappeared or anything at all really.  I don’t even remember the rest of that day..or the following few days.   It’s a struggle to pull the memory of what I saw that day and exactly when and where this took place but both me and my 40 year old mother witnessed this and we both had never seen anything like it before.  My mom commented saying that maybe it was a plane flying at a really weird angle, but again the craft was not flying.  It was hovering in some sort of a dance with itself.   This was the first of the 4 UFOs I have witnessed in the past 9 days, I have always believed in UFOs and Alien existence but I have never been so confident in saying that I have seen things that prove its all real.   I do live within a reasonable distance from Joint Base Lewis McCord. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Stationary bell shaped object seen in daytime sky.;2014-06-08 15:00:00;20 minutes;Stationary bell shaped object seen in daytime sky. My husband and I were walking along a boardwalk that follows the Ruston Way waterfront in Tacoma, Wa.  I happened to notice an object that I first thought was a balloon but i realized that it couldn't be that because it was too high up and was stationary.  Airplanes were passing underneath, so if they fly at cruising altitude of 35000 miles than this was much higher.   From the naked eye, I couldn't make out a shape but after I took a picture and was able to zoom in, I saw that it had two parts to it.   Bell shaped on one end and attached to it, an egg shape.   It looks whitish grey against the blue background of the sky.   We watched it for about 20 min.   I went to use the bathroom and when I came back, I couldn't find it again.

Flaming silent object near joint military base JBLM in south Tacoma.;2016-01-22 23:55:00;15 seconds;Flaming silent object near joint military base JBLM in south Tacoma. Seen out a north facing window.  Appeared as a large, balled up sheet of paper on fire, and was moving rapidly south, just east of I-5.   I ran outside and saw it continue southward silently at about sixty mph.  It neither slowed down, nor speed up.  It traveled straight and level and, as I wrote before, was completely silent. The weird thing-as though that wasn't weird enough-was that the orange glow and subdued flames were not streaming behind it.  The flames/glow were as if it was actually a stationary object even though it was traveling through the air (as I wrote) at about sixty mph.  It soon disappeared behind a tall stand of firs, where I lost track of it.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

I tried to get my phone out, and went to take a video, then I looked up and it was gone.  It had hovered upward very high and was east when it disappeared.

Bright geometric arrowhead shaped object Flying over Tacoma, WA.;2017-07-25 22:04:00;45 seconds;Bright Geometric Arrowhead Shaped Object Flying over Tacoma, WA. It was a very clear night.  I was on the 11th street bridge, watching the night sky,  I began walking down Dock Street towards the Museum of Glass, when I saw a bright White/Blue light.  The object looked to be like two triangles of light connected and waved side to side hundreds of feet at a time.  It was swimming through the sky  It was distorted all around it almost like gravity was being distorted and pulled around it.  I thought it was plane as this is a common route for planes heading to Sea Tac.  It was completely quite the object headed north to almost the horizon line and stopped.   It then descended straight down.  I captured just a blip on my phone but the fact that it even showed up on my iPhone was impressive.  I have no idea what this was, it was way too low to be a satellite and was not a plane.  It looked man made, but was hard to see with the distortion and light.  It was definitely solid and seemed to be like an arrow head made of two triangles.  It was traveling extremely fast and I estimated at about 10,000 feet.  I would love to hear if anyone else saw this!   There were helicopters in the area I am not sure if they were chasing it or not due to the high traffic.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Small Metallic Red Tri-Orb UFO Viewed Descending Towards Seattle from AA Flight Passenger;2020-07-14 13:45:00;5 seconds;Small Metallic Red Tri-Orb UFO Viewed Descending Towards Seattle from AA Flight Passenger As my flight from Seattle/Tacoma International airport to Dallas was making its initial ascent, I observed a very odd object that was descending below us headed generally NW and at a rapid pace.  I was sitting in the first-class cabin on the left side of the aircraft looking out of my window.  The object was a single unit that looked like three metallic red round orbs that were connected.  It flashed across my view and seemed to be moving at a downward angle. During my frequent air travel, I have seen multiple small aircraft passing below my view, and they have always been easily identified as small jets or airplanes.  This immediately caught my attention as an oddity.  I estimate the size to have been about the size of a VW Bug.  I can make the estimation of size purely on my perception of distance.  Because the red metallic color was so clear, I believe the craft passed no more than 1000 feet below us.
