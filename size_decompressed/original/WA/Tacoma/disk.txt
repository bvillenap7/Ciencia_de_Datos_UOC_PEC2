Object sighted by New Zealand Tourist in Tacoma 7 years ago.;1997-03-07 19:00:00;2 minutes;Object sighted by New Zealand Tourist in Tacoma 7 years ago. I was visiting from New Zealand at the time and staying with some relations. It was appoximatly 7:00 pm, I was standing out by a farm building when all of a sudden a glowing object saucer shaped object with a triangular protrusion from either side caught my eye. It was about 25 degrees above the horizon to the west. The object stayed stationary. At the time I did not think terribly much of it because I had only just arrived in Tacoma from Auckland so I was rather tired. I was not until a day or to later that I had a think about what I had seen. I refrained from telling anyone about my experience for several years. I do except the fact that it could of been one of many human or natural phenomonon. McChord AFB is also in the area, I do not beleive it was an aircraft from there because McChord only operates C-141 and C-17 transport aircraft. I am an aviation specialist myself and I am sure the apirition I witnessed was neither any of these aircraft.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

Flying Suacer(?) seen in August inTacoma/Puyallup neighborhood;2003-08-15 15:30:00;20-30 seconds;Flying Suacer(?) seen in August inTacoma/Puyallup neighborhood My daughter (12 years young) was watching the skies for no apparent reason and quickly noticed a strange craft. She hollared over to me and her best friend (11 years young) to look at something weird. We took the few steps down the back porch to get the view she had. She was aprox. Instantly we noticed the strange craft. It was a charcoal colored disk with a center that was shining. The color of the light was a whiteish/blue and simliar to the color of electricity. This craft was...guesstimating here....about the size of a larger helicopter. It seemed to fly at a slow speed. I would compare it to a car going 30 mph. I have no idea as to how high up it was. Again, I'll compare it to something familiar. We often have medivacs cruise thru here everyday or so. They seem to be heading to Seattle or out to the VA hospital area (Fort Lewis). Well, I'd say that this craft flew a little higher than theses helicopters. It made no sound and was in no hurry. I checked the wind direction to decide if it was being blown but it was not the wind doing this. It was moving in a straight direction towards Puyallup Valley area which is aprox 5 miles from my Eastside neighborhood. I feel foolish now for mocking all of those silly spaceship/UFO shows from the 50's/60's. It didn't look like a man made object. The way it moved was unlike anything I've seen. And the shiney light, (probably blinding if you were 500 feet or so closer), seemed to be an energy source. Perhaps the sun? It also seemed to be reflecting the sun and maybe that reflection is maybe why it seemed so shiney and  the color of lightning. To my shock, this darned thing was a flying saucer. No way!;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

At first I thought they were stars but then I realized  they were moving following one bigger object.  The bigger object had 5 bright lights coming from it, and looked like the shape of a saucer.   Then they started moving faster and one by one they were disappearing over the freeway.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Black disk.;2015-03-30 12:25:00;10 seconds;At 12:25 p.m in Tacoma WA.i was sitting outside looking into the beautiful sky and I noticed a black disk coming out of the clouds very slowly (very distinct ) as my mind was processing what I'm seeing this disk makes like a z shape and then shoots up towards the sky this disk was very low 5-7 thousand feet.  when I went to get my phone to the video section it had flown off.this was so surreal.  i have not stopped thinking of this all day.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

It appeared to be a silver disk spinning with lights changing colors emitting from the middle of the disk. It moves extremely slow and stayed in the same spot for almost 10 minutes. It began to rise and get further away then it slowly returned back towards us again and began to rise again then seemed to get further away. We could tell it was not a helicopter or a airplane. It was a disk or saucer. It appearedto be silver with multiple color lights in between two top and bottom saucers. it had blue, green, yellow and red lights in between. The lights were spinning different speed than the saucer. It made no sound at all. Ive taken some video and a couple pictures with my phone. Unfortunately it doesn't show great detail.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
