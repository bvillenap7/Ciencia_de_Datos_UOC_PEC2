In my peripheral vision I saw a a light streak across a short distance of the sky--if it had been just a few feet away, I would have perceived its speed as over 100 mph.  Considering it seemed more like a few thousand feet away, it must have been going at least 1000 mph. If I had witnessed this at night, I would have assumed it was a shooting star, but the sun had been up for an hour.  It was foggy, but I could still see the blue sky clearly.  It left a short contrail that faded at both ends.  The incident and contrail seemed to close to earth to have been a meteor, even if it were possible to see it during the daylight.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Green flash with maybe a little red and white lights, it went by very fast;2011-12-12 04:30:00;1 sec;green flash with maybe a little red and white lights, it went by very fast it was a mostly green object I SAW in the night sky as I was headed for work,  it was gone in a blink of the eye,  I thought at first it was fire-works, but the projectile was going across the sky not doing the typical flight pattern a firework would do and it was too fast to be any jet.I am not stating that I saw a space ship,  but I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SAW hence, ufo.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Their Real ..Do not  believe everything your government tells you ,High Science holds the key.;2012-11-14 23:43:00;~two minutes;Their Real ..Do not  believe everything your government tells you ,High Science holds the key. LOCATION: Tacoma,Wa  COLOR: same as a star SIZE:  MOTION: (Blinking)left,right,up,up,left,down.all directions DIRECTION:according to the compass it was 115°SE when i lost sight of it the compass read 321°NW   For the last few months Ive been more into watching & trying to study the patterns of the stars.  Since oct 19th or so during haileys comets dust trails..(shooting stars).  I happened to be able (along with many others i'm sure) to witness that event.  So since then i've been tuned in more to whats above us...so I started bringing out the ole telescope, pad, pen & digital video camera.... The setting of which my claim took place is a balcony on the top (3rd) floor...On any clear night you'll see the moon & stars with no problem.... I've also taken in the consideration of that this location is near a amry/airforce base which has plenty of air traffic along with the normal planes you see as well.., also took in consideration of the fact that the Leonid meteor shower is roughly from nov 13-21 peaking around the 19th/20th I reckon. What happened was, I was out on the balcony with my camera & notepad same as almost every night checking out the stars as usual ..Then I see what appears to be a star but it dissapears a second later it flashed again but in a different spot this went on for almost a minute then I grabbed my HDcamcorder... Which took a few seconds to focus on the sky but, I see no &quotblink&quot Bout 17 seconds into the video I look down at the porch (balcony floor) to make sure the camera was working ok. As I aim back towards the sky It flashes again  multiple times..I lost sight with the camera bout 23 seconds later...it finally blinked, then it was higher blinked again even higher ..as I back against the railing around the balcony watching this ufo I see it's very high now .(normally in this area the military planes are very low)  It continued this same pattern across the sky..then vanished......The pattern of this ufo..which appeared to be in guise of a star..moved in directions unlike any thing i have ever seen when i re-watch the footage it sends chills....in a good but eerie way....I waited exactly a month to report this...(except to some people I know)  Its a sad day dec_14th due to the conn. school shooting ..was weird to me is its a month later from this 'thing &quot I saw...... So hopefully I'm able to send the footage your way or who evers...& hopefully it gets analyzed..so I know something...Because I truly believe it was other worldly..either way ..I just want the piece of mind.…;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
