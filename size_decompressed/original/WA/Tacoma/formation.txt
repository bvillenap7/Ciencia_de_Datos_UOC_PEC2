Video taped 3-6 shiny objects for 12 min hovering in the sky in a V formation while other objects flew around them.;2003-09-13 15:35:00;18 min;Video taped 3-6 shiny objects for 12 min hovering in the sky in a V formation while other objects flew around them. On 9/13/03, in Tacoma WA, my wife and I were on our front porch having a smoke when she asked me what that was in the sky (West direction).  I looked where she was pointing and I knew right off the bat that this was not man made.  I saw 3 bright objects in a v shaped cluster between some trees in the sky.  They looked like orbs but very metalic bright like sun reflection off of chrome. I ran into the house to get my video camera (2 min. time)and when I came back, the objects were gone.  I asked my wife what happened and she stated that they just blinked out.  I went South 1/2 a block from my house looking West and Southwest in the sky looking for them.  I found them and they had moved several miles from the point of first sighting.  I started taping them with a Sony digital video camera. The objects stayed in a V shape formation with 2 at the top and what looked like several miles below there was 1.  They kept blinking in and out.  I taped the objects for 12 min.  While taping them, I saw what I thought were things falling out of the sky (during replay I had caught other objects flying around the first 3 objects).  At the last min of taping, my battery was going dead on my camera, and the objects came together and formed a tight V shape and rotated counter clockwise to a line.  My battery went dead after that.  I went into my house to get my telescope to see them and the UFO's had gone when I came back.  Around 2 min time had elapsed. I went into my house and dubbed the tape to a VHS tape and I was amazed at what I had recorded.  I caught more then what I was looking at.  I caught objects that I did not see while taping.  What looked like flashes and falling objects were other UFO's that I did not see.  I had to jog the tape frame by frame to see some of these other UFO's doing manuvers that we as a people could not do with the technoligy that we have.  I manage several high value warehouses for World wide companies.  I also have passed FBI background checks. I have been employed with my job for 5 years.  My wife manages a company also.  We bought our house on this street over 5 years ago.  We have 2 kids and are respected in our fields. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness was kind enough to provide us with 10 minutes of video footage of the objects.  We have reviewed the tape, and we find it to be ambiguous, with respect to the issue of the three objects being bona fide UFO's.  They could be three slowly drifting balloons in a clear, blue, cloudless sky, we believe.  PD));47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Three orange circles without depth, quickly, randomly and fluidly dancing in tight formation, moving silently;2004-10-12 00:00:00;4 seconds;Three orange circles without depth, quickly, randomly and fluidly dancing in tight formation, moving silently George Bush was at McChord AFB or Ft. Lewis at the time, I don't remember which. I can't recall the exact time and date, I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to find out, I'm fairly certain it was October.   My neighbor and I were outside talking and he remarked he was watching the F-16s or whatever they were doing circles around what I guess was the Puget Sound area.  We were guessing they were circling because GW was in town and the whole terrorist threat and all that was (is) going on.   As we looked over the roof of my apartment which from my position is south to south east, we both saw three orange circles that seemed to dance around and change formation in random order. They changed places but never intersected, very quickly, while moving east.  I didn't see them disappear, as I took my eyes off them to tell my wife to come look, I asked my neighbor, Did you see that? and he said Yes. I said What WAS that?. At first I thought the jets were chasing it or it was chasing the jets, but it was too hard to judge the distance. It looked like it could have been 100 feet away or 2 miles away. The reason I couldn't judge the distance, I think, was because it was unlike anything I'd ever seen in the sky.  They weren't like lights because the edges were crisp, or at least not blurry, something in between.  They didn't glow so much as they were just on. It was hard to tell if they changed shape as they maneuvered because they moved so fast. They looked very close at first, because of their clarity...but they made no sound, and so I reasoned that they could not be close. I think they got smaller as they danced away, it was hard to tell. It all happened so fast. Maybe four seconds. I then reasoned it may have been a reflection off my glasses or something but my neighbor saw it too. I got very excited about what I just saw. I told my wife I saw a UFO or something. My neighbor and I tried to figure out what it could have been, and came to the conclusion it must have been a UFO, as it was unlike anything we had ever seen. Right after it all happened, I went back outside and looked up in that direction hoping to see something more, but after several minutes I thought it foolish to think I would see something like that again in the same place in the universe. To this day, I cannot accurately describe what they looked like- not bright like a light, no discernable three dimensional shape except circular almost like putting a flashlight to a piece of clear-orange plastic, but not glowing(?).    When I say danced, it was not a zig-zagging movement so much as it was a quick and fluid motion, so fast I didn't see a pattern to it.  They seemed to randomly switch around positions in a very, very tight formation as they moved in a group.  Proportionately, if they were billiard ball size, the formation never got more than, if even, five billiard balls across in any direction.  The whole thing was over so quickly, I imagine it may have been only two seconds, I really don't know.  Two days ago I talked with my neighbor and recalled that night and we both agree we have no idea what we saw.  He is from what I know of him an average and honest guy,  maybe 10 or 15 years older than I am.  I have never asked him if he has ever seen a UFO, but he seemed to me to be fairly accepting and not so surprised as I was.  Kinda like, Yep, there's one right there.  The people I work with would laugh at me if I told them, although my family did not.  Although I may have marked it on my calendar (which I have since thrown away), and I don't recall the exact day, I'll never forget seeing whatever it was I saw.

4 to 5 arrow shaped object race through the sky over Commencment Bay;2008-11-08 22:15:00;5 to 8 sec;4 to 5 arrow shaped object race through the sky over Commencment Bay On the night of November 08,2008 approximately 10:15pm as I was walking with my date I just happen to notice a group of about 4 to 5 arrowhead shaped objects coming from the north.  Initially my date and I thought they were a small group of birds, however they had a yellowish-white dim kind of glow.  As they went over our head in a v formation heading in a southbound direction, they sped up and began to break their formation and seem to play some type of aerial game then disappeared into know where.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
15 -20 amber lights in sky in square formation over North Tacoma, Washington;2011-08-20 21:30:00;1 min;15 -20 amber lights in sky in square formation over North Tacoma, Washington A neighbor came outside yelling that there were lights in the sky.  I looked at where she was pointing and I saw 15 - 20 amber lights in the sky - no noise, but close enough that there should have been noise.   They were in square formations.  They moved across the sky in the west from north to south then faded.  I could still see a black dot where each of the lights had been, then they disappeared.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
