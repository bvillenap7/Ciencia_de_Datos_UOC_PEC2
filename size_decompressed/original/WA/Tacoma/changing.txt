Orange light over Tacoma, Washington.;2007-07-04 23:40:00;10 mins;Orange light over Tacoma, Washington. While watching fireworks, we looked up in the sky and saw this bright orange object. At first it seemed to be sitting still and emitted off two orange objects that then turned into what seemed to be fireworks. We originally thought that it was a plane and then realized it was hovering. The object seemed to be gaining altitude while moving in a southern direction. While it was moving upwards, it emitted four more orange objects, although, they did not turn into fireworks this time.  Then the object seemed to be losing altitude at a high rate of speed.  It then disappeared completely.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
