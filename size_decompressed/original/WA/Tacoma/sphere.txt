Orange Sphere;1976-06-01 20:00:00;10 Seconds;I had no idea there was a place to share this kind of information.  Anyway, my friend and I were playing foosball in Tacoma at Games Unlimited on 19th and Mildred.  Oswald Airport was located at the same site, but had been closed and was being turned into a strip mall.  Some of the old runway was still intact, so we'd use it as a bathroom (I was 16 at the time).  I stepped onto the old runway to do my business and saw an orange sphere on the runway, behind some Scotch Broom (the runway was starting to get overgrown).  When my eyes made contact with the sphere it turned from dull orange to bright orange.  It flew straight up, and was out of sight in seconds.  The weather that evening was nothing but clear blue sky.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

Spet 13 03 saw 2 glowing spheres traveling north to south then becoming staionary for 20 to 30 mins. high above my house.;2003-09-13 14:30:00;20 to 30 min;Spet 13 03 saw 2 glowing spheres traveling north to south then becoming staionary for 20 to 30 mins. high above my house. Sat. Sept 13 2003 in the afternoon, between 2 or 3 pm, I was laying in my hammok in my backyard talking to my mother on the phone as I was starring into the clear blue sky.  The sky was clear, no clouds.  I was looking to the east and saw an object traveling in a  north to south direction at a constant speed, really high up.  First I thought it could be a plane but I thought it was really high and the object had no wings that I could see, it was light blue in color and it looked kind of circular I was watching it with my naked eye (realiseing I couldn't see detail), asking my mother how high planes fly at. A few minutes later, traveling in the same north to south direction as I am looking to the east, a second oject, silver in color and lower in elevation, it looked like it was traveling at the same speed as the higher blue object. I told my mother that these two objects just did not look like planes and suddenly the two objects stopped and became stationary in the sky at the elevevations they were traveling at.  I ran into my house to get my binoculars, came back out and saw they were still in the same position in the sky.  I saw with my binoculars that both objects were spheres with a glow to them.  The first light blue sphere had a slightly lighter bluish glow and the silver sphere had a white hot glow with a bit of red in it.  The silver sphere seemed to change shape alittle as it  looked like it was rotating.  The sun was reflecting off the silver object the blue sphere was really high to see any reflections from the sun.   A courious situation happened soon after the two objects had become stationary, I noticed a  red balloon that had come loose from one of the car lots by my house, it was traveling up to the position of the silver object.  It was almost like the object had seen the balloon too.  The balloon went close to the silver object and as it passed I saw that it never went higher in the sky, the silver sphere seemed to stop it from going higher.  I'm guessing now but silver! sphere seemed to grab it because the baloon was not visible any more.  I watched the two spheres for what seemed to be a good 20 to 30 minutes.  I noticed the objects seemed to getting smaller but they were still in their stationary positions.  Then I lost sight of them, but remember I said courious about the balloon?  The red balloon was comming back down towards the ground,  then I lost sight of the baloon behind some houses.  I kept looking in the sky hopeing to catch sight of the two objects again and to my surprise I saw that the blue shpere (the same one or different) was now in a more northern position in the sky, still about as high as I saw it earlier.  I saw it, then it was gone again.  I could see these object with my naked eye still.  Then as I was laying on my hammok again starring stairght up into the sky,  I saw the silver shere again straight over my position flying north to south at a lower elevation then I had seen it earlier.  I don't know if it was another sphere or the same one but it was silver with the same red white hot glow.  I could see it better the second time even with my naked eye but used my binoculars too.  I was watching the silver object for a few minutes then I lost sight of it.  I know what I saw was not planes, hellicopters, balloons, swamp gas, or any other man made object.  I even entertained ball lightning but these objects acted like they were in flight and also were stationary.  My mother is a phone witness that I was seeing the objects because I was talking to her when it all started and I almost had a second eye witness, my neighbor was in his back yard while I was watching the two objects but he couldn't see them, it was about the time they were becomming even too small for me to see.  My next door neighbor said he saw a blueish sphere across the street the week before from our houses, he said is was hovering below some power lines and caused them to spark.  I looked at the power lines and they are blackened and scortched where the sparking happened.  He thin! ks he saw ball lightning.  His discription  seems kind of like  my blue sphere but I think I was looking at more than ball lightning by the way the 2 objects acted, like something or some one was piloting them.  I live by McChord AFB and Fort Lewis  I see lots of planes every day, I did see a plane flying in the area at the time, it didn't seem to see them. I know these objects are out of this world.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Two UFO sighted over Tacoma's Commencement Bay;2007-01-20 12:35:00;5 minutes;Two UFO sighted over Tacoma's Commencement Bay I am submitting a report of a UFO sighting which occurred on Saturday January 20, 2007 at 12:35 pm. I am a construction worker, and I was working in Tacoma Washington at the Simpson Pulp Mill at the mouth of the Puyallup River on the edge of Commencement Bay. I was working what is called a shutdown on the mill, this is when the Boiler is taken off line and is repaired, my boss was setting me up on a job to replace the hanger rods on the primary exhaust which feeds directly into the smokestack which is at a height of fifty to sixty feet. Scaffolding had been erected around the duct as to give us access to work. The sky at that time was partially cloudy with a 30% to 40% cloud cover. My lead man and I were climbing one of the ladders on the scaffolding when I noticed a round brilliant white object at a high altitude moving across the sky it looked somewhat like a weather balloon and I pointed it out to my lead when he reached the top of the ladder. My lead man asked me what I though it was, and I told him I wasn’t sure but it looked similar to a weather balloon, and it was moving slowly from west to the east, and we watched it for thirty seconds or so, my lead man then said common I want to show you something else which pertained to the job. We stepped out of direct sight, but I kept looking back into the sky at the object. The object continued to slowly move to the east at almost a 12 o’clock position in the sky. I then noticed a second object which looked identical to the other it was positioned directly in the path of the first at the same high altitude, but it was stationary both objects appeared to be about a quarter the diameter of the sun or slightly less. The first object then stopped and held position close to the second both not moving, I then summoned my lead man and said check this out, there are two of them now. My lead man then asked what do you think they are, and said “I am not sure what they are! but they are UFO’s.” My lead man then stated that I must be smoking something if I think they’re UFO’s, to which I replied “it must be the same thing your smoking because you’re seeing them too,” but neither one of was smoking anything, and they were real. The boss said common I’ve got to show you something else and we moved out of visual contact and when I came back they were gone. The whole encounter didn’t last five minutes, but I remember looking at my watch several times to confirm the time, it read 12:35 pm. One other thing that was kind of strange is that I kept thinking, to myself that they must be surveying our industrial progress, and I am not sure why I was thinking that, but they were directly over the heavy industrialized area of Commencement Bay.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

I observed the object less than two minutes. The object was the size of a large bright night star and glowing white.  The object jumped around in the sky, down and up and continued east.  The object blinked off for a few seconds and then appeared again, continuing to move east.  Then the object started moving west back towards the rainbow and suddenly shot straight up into the sky.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Orange glowing sphere seen flying from the direction of The Cascade Mountains then over house.;2013-07-29 21:45:00;5 seconds;Orange glowing sphere seen flying from the direction of The Cascade Mountains then over house. Last night at about 9:45pm, I saw a glowing orange sphere coming from the direction of the Cascade Mountains to over my house at a fast rate of speed.  It looked like it was at a low altitude and no noise was heard coming from it. It is hard to say the size, I’m not quite sure. It didn’t appear very large, maybe Helicopter size. I lost track of the object as I ran through the house to the front door.  When I came out of the house, it was gone.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Spherical UFO with rotating light spotted moving south over the Puget Sound and Narrows Bridge.;2016-06-12 19:42:00;10 minutes;Spherical UFO with rotating light spotted moving south over the Puget Sound and Narrows Bridge. On the evening of June 12, 2016, I was sitting in the living room of my aunt & uncle's house, talking to my cousin.  I was facing a large bay window and through it I saw what I thought was a plane.  It was heading south, towards us, and had 3 blinking lights.  Two on the left (when facing us) and one on the right.  These lights blinked 2 then 1, 2 then 1, left then right, left then right. As it got closer I couldn't make out its shape so I asked my cousin, What's that?  He thought it might be a helicopter.  To check if it was a helicopter I went outside to see if I could hear it.  I could not. By now the craft was overhead and west of us.  It was essentially flying over the Narrows Bridge along the course southward over the Puget Sound. This is when I took out my iPhone and shot about 35 seconds of footage.  It was now 7:42 pm. I stopped filming because some trees would soon obscure my view.  So I went in the backyard to continue watching it.  I asked my uncle what it was.  He didn't know.  I asked if it could be a helicopter, but he said it was too high.  It was definitely very high and flying at a constant velocity on a flat trajectory. I asked my uncle if he had binoculars.  He went inside and grabbed a pair while I continued watching it.  I pointed out the object to my aunt and 8 year-old son, too.  None of us knew what it was. The object continued moving southward and was soon nearly too small to see.  When my uncle returned with the binoculars I was only able to find the object in my sight once before losing it again.  The sun was lowering and bright enough to where I needed to block it with my hand.  It made finding the object at a distance challenging.  The object then became too faint at such a distance and I lost it. The whole event must've lasted approximately 10 or so minutes.  Maybe 15. A review of the National Weather service showed that at 7:53pm in that vicinity the wind direction was NNE and velocity of the wind was 5mph.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Bird/animal disturbance in the trees. 30 clear orbs rose up slowly. Then once at high elevation, flew around doing maneuvers.;2020-08-30 17:30:00;10 minutes;Bird/animal disturbance in the trees. 30 clear orbs rose up slowly. Then once at high elevation, flew around doing maneuvers. @ approximately 5:30pm, Friday, August 30th, Tacoma  WA, the following occurred. -  A loud sound of birds chattering in the tall pines caused me to investigate my home backyard.  Upon stepping out to see why, the group of maybe 100+ birds got even louder. Almost like the sound of a loud creek or river.  As I walked up to examine why, Many orbs ascended slowly out of the tops of the trees.  They were *very* close and I could see them well.  Each orb was about the size of a soccer ball. Every sphere resembled a soap bubble, except they were all perfectly uniform, perfectly sphere, crystal clear.  As the swarm rose higher, the group of about 30 orbs began to form two seperate clusters.  They then became either much more reflective of the sun at a higher altitude, or, they possibly began to emit their own bioluminescence or possibly mechanical light as they became much brighter as opposed to translucent.  Once they had achieved an altitude at about twice the height a drone would fly, the objects then began doing 'maneuvers', and forming geometric shapes and patterns such as triangles, 90°angles etc. By the time myself and a second witness ran inside to grab a better camera and return, the sighting was over.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
