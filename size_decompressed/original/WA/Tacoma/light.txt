I looked up into the night sky only to see a comet streaking across the sky, but then it made a squiggle and disappeared.;1999-04-12 21:30:00;10 seconds;I looked up into the night sky only to see a comet streaking across the sky, but then it made a squiggle and disappeared. I had been visiting my neighbor and was outside saying good-night when above her head I saw a comet (I was facing south and the comet went from east to west). But the comet made a squiggle (as if someone was holding a flashlight and started jostling it up-&-down rapidly). Then the comet was gone. I dismissed it thinking it may have been a moth, but moths don't just disappear. This comet was orange, was flying in a straight linethen it made a squiggle and just as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared. Vanished. As if plucked from the sky. At this time, it was dark, but there was a street light directly to my left, thus my thought it was a moth that had been flying away from the street light. We've had a good view of the stars at night until last night. I did noth bring this to my friends attention as she was facing the wrong way and by the time I could have blurted out the words, it would have been too late. And I didn't want her thinking I was seeing things.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

This star appeared ;2000-06-23 21:30:00;5- 10 min;Beginning on 6/23/00 and occurring each night for three consequetive nights, I saw what I first took to be a star.  This star appeared in the NNW section of the sky, fairly low.  It seemed to stay in one location, which lead me to believe it was a star, until it suddenly and slowly began moving toward the NNE.  The object disappeared behind a tree and was lost from view.  This happned on the next two nights with the object appearing in the same area and following the same behavior.  The object, through binoculars could be seen to change color from red, to blue, to white.  Several planes in the area either did not see it, or the object was further away and out of their line of sight.

bright red light hovering above the clouds, then accelerating away.;2000-07-04 22:25:00;5 minutes;bright red light hovering above the clouds, then accelerating away. I spotted a bright red light hanging in the sky.  There was light cloud cover in the area. The light was hanging in a clear spot in the sky. At first, I thought it might be a flare, but after 2-3 minutes without moving or changing intensity, I realized it was something other than a flare. The object seemed to have a slight aura around it - it was not an aircraft light. Two of my friends also saw the light after I remarked how it was odd that this light had not moved. After 2-3 minutes, the light began to strobe between bright/medium intensity, then began to accelerate away from me. It seemed to take a slight hooking turn just prior to heading directly away in a straight line. As it passed over a thin cloud, I saw the light shine through the cloud.  So, the object/light was higher in altitude than the clouds.  The object accelerated smoothly, getting dimmer, and also strobing faster as it traveled away, until it passed out of sight. I've been in the military and my profession is a computer programmer/analyst. I'm familiar with aircraft, weather patterns, and astronomy.

Absolutely stationary red light for 10 - 15 minutes, then abruptly took off towards the South.;2000-07-04 22:30:00;10 - 15 min;Absolutely stationary red light for 10 - 15 minutes, then abruptly took off towards the South. We were at home just north of downtown Tacoma, watching fireworks being set off in the Puyallup valley and East Tacoma, looking in a southeast direction. I became aware of a single red light, looking to be over Tacoma, and very high MUCH higher that fireworks.  There is a lot of airplane traffic in this area in and out of Sea-Tac, so at first I just assumed it was an incoming aircraft.  A few minutes later I looked back and noticed it had not moved.  Incidently, it's position was lined up so that a point of one of the downtown buildings pointed directly towards it, so it was easy to see that it was not moving. I pointed it out to my husband at this point it had been there about five minutes.  As we watched, we saw an outgoing plane fly near it, but the plane looked to be much higher, although it's hard to be sure of the light's altitude.  There were some light, high clouds that evening, and it was at about that elevation, as we could see them passing in front of the light. After being absolutely stationary for at least 10 minutes, perhaps 15, it took off at a fairly fast rate of speed, (faster than air traffic) towards the South and disapeared into the clouds (or the light went out).  I tried to view the object through our very crappy binoculars, but it just looked like a steady, red light.  When it took off it may have started blinking, or it may have been the cloud layer hard to tell. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this time and date.

A bright object in the southern sky began brightening then dimmed and moved accross the sky toward the west.;2000-08-04 23:00:00;1.5 MINUTES;A bright object in the southern sky began brightening then dimmed and moved accross the sky toward the west. At approximately 2259 hrs, in the southern sky, approximately 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon, at a rough bearing of 190 degrees the object appeared as a star or a satellite, faint redish-orange in color, and was not moving.  The object began brightening intensely over a period of approx. 3 to 4 seconds, appearing to be bright bluish-white in color.  The object then dimmed and moved across toward the western sky.  The path was steady but had slight increasing angle to the horizon.  Movement was similar to a satellite.  At a position of rough bearing of 260 degrees, the object diverted from a trajectory of moving across the sky to one of increasing angle above the horizon.  The object was dimming thru the entire movement process, making it difficult to continue tracking it.  It was also beginning to slow.  It appeared to almost stop movement at a point 60 degrees above the horizon, then its trajectory continued moving toward a higher angle above the horizon. The entire movement occured over a period of approximately 25 to 30 seconds.  Contact was lost when the object was approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon at a rough bearing of 230 degrees.  I stopped looking for the object at 2304 hrs.  Object was sighted by naked eye.  Skies were clear, no aircraft near the object, no moonlight in my line of site.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
A light, reddish orange in color, resembling that of an aircraft, approached from the West briefly, then dipped and disappeared.;2001-06-04 23:33:00;~30 seconds;A light, reddish orange in color, resembling that of an aircraft, approached from the West briefly, then dipped and disappeared. I went outside the house to smoke a cigarrette.  The porch light was on.  A car had passed by in the neighborhood and it sounded as if it had just blown a tire a block or so away before approaching our (my fiance and I) house.  This is unrelated, I'm sure.  I am always aware of my surroundings and we do get many military craft flying in to the local military base.  I noticed a what appearded to be an aircraft flying in toward Tacoma from the West.  This is not a normal flight path but some planes do fly in this direction I suppose headed toward Sea Tac or Boeing Field in Seattle.  At first I noticed the color of the light wasn't 'normal' - more of a reddish/orange light.  And I was wiating for familiar 'wing lights' to be present.  This was a single light and it appeared to be moving in a very straight (due East) direction.  I watched it for a few seconds and maybe after 20 seconds or so I noticed the light dimming (this object appeared to be headed toward my direction) and slightly dip dramatically straight down and disappear.  This is hard to judge distance (of course) but if my field of view was shown in a photograph I suppose the 'dipping' of the object would be measured as 1/4 inches on an 8X10 photo.  So, this didn't dip very far before disappearing.  There were clouds present and this object appeared behind the clouds but was very visible. I have never reported a sighting before.  I wanted to report this and am sure other's saw this.  I am not aware of any other places to make a report to - I suppose I could contact the newspaper, but don't know if it would be treated with any credibility.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Hovering light pattern under cloud cover in otherwise clear night sky;2002-05-23 03:00:00;30+;Hovering light pattern under cloud cover in otherwise clear night sky I had been up late working on an art project and stepped outside to shake off the clay dust that had accumulated.  The flashing light in tthe sky caught my eye, and at first I thought they were spotlights shining up from tbe ground as they do sometimes for movie premiers or grand openings.  I thought it was such a foolish thing to do at 3AM.  The more I watched the more interested I became.  At first I was attracted by the pattern the lights were making, then I realized the lights were not emenating from a completely stationary source, and at about the same time discerned that the beams were not in fact coming up from the ground.  I was sure of this as they were shining through the only cloud I could see in the sky.  the cloud itself was interesting in that it appeared to have a clear though pitch black center and was itself approximately circular shaped.  The lights themselves repeated a pattern they would efveidently cluster (for lack of a better word) around a center slightly forward and to the left of the cloudless center and then would shine or fly outward in four or five different directions, evenly spaced apart, forming a circle.  If the spacing of the lights was any indication of an object behind the clouds, the thing would have been huge!  The more I observed the more certain I was that the beams of light were not seperate from an object, as individual light objects forming a pattern and flying independently, but were from a fixed point though I couldn't quite track a beam through the clouds.  That could be explained as lights shining down from the bottom of something moving along a track and going back to a center point.  I can't think of an analogy.  I bbecame aware tthat the lights were getting closer and that they could actually be coming from something quite low to the ground.  I got scared and went inside.  But I heard one of my neighbors come home and went out front to the parking lot and pointed the lights out to him.  We watched them for a few minutes and he said he had seen them! before, that they were a secret government project designed to make us look crazy., mind you he'd been drinking, so I don't know what to make of his comment.  I looked up again and the lights had again shifted towards the side of the building that the parking lot is on and seemed to be coming closer.  I again went inside.  I was scared an excited and ddidn't know what to think.  The only thing I could hear when I was outside were crickets, absolutely nothing else until my neighbor's car pulled in.  I realized my cats were still outside and stepped out one more time, it was still there and this time started moving closer right away and was almost directly overhead.  That really shook me up.  I debated calling the police or the news but didn't want to sound like a nut.  I was afraid that by the time anyone offical checked it out it would be long gone, it had already been there for at least a half hour.  This time I went on my computer and instant mesaged a freind that had come on line and told her what I was seeing.  After 15 minutes I decided to look and see if it was still there.  It was gone, so was the cloud, and the night was suddenly warm whereas before it been decidely chilly even though the weather forecast had called for a relatively warm night (finally).  I seem to recall reading something about ufos creating clouds but couldn't find any descriptions that matched what I saw.  Especially the distinctive pattern of lights.  They were all white, no other colors.  So are there any logical explanations other than a UFO?  Are these the nice ones or the meanies?  Should I step out and greet them the next time?  If there is? ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM SAME SOURCE, SUBMITTED JULY 27, 2002)) Previous report and update plus one several years ago I reported the sighting already on 5/28/2002.  I wanted to request further information.  I really am curious to see if anyone else has reported anything similar to what I saw.  I'm not convinced it was a craft but for the fact that the light couldn't have been traveling through the cloud from the ground, I would have seen the light path as it passed through.  Secondly the circular clound surrounding the event and the chill as well as the silence and then the sudden disappearance (though I didn't witness it leave) convince me that this was more than just an average light or cloud.  If not a UFO what else could it have been?  I was being facetious about the alien contact comment.  It was late and I was rather ashamed of myself for getting so scared.  I've looked through numerous entries on you site and others and haven't found anything quite like it.  And though I distinctly remember reading something about UFO's hiding in circular clouds I cannot find anything confirming this.  There are numerous UFO sightings in the Tacoma/Lakewood area.  One night several years ago my daughter, a ffriend and I saw lights streaking across the sky betweem Tacoma and Puyallup, then they hovered and took off again, we all agreed it could not have been a plane and that was confirmed when we listened to the rradio, numerous people called the station and saw what we saw.  Interestingly even though we are near an airforce and army base there were no aircraft in pursuit.  We see planes all the time in this area, of all types.  This did not appear to be a plane.  So though a long time skeptic, I'm becoming a believer.  Aliens?  I don't know, but I'd love to find out.  As long as I knew I was safe that is.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

Silver and Gold balls of light;2004-08-28 19:45:00;5 to 10 min;Silver and Gold balls of light I had walked out onto my back deck to see if the clouds looked like they might clear so I could take my telescope out.  As I was looking toward the west, a silver ball of light caught my eye.  This light moved from south to north with no noise and no flashing lights (we live near McChord AFB and SeaTac flight paths and frequently see planes in the distance).  My second thought was a bird, but the light moved very smoothly, with none of the obvious Bobbing of a bird, plus it was illuminated from the east side, not the west where the sun was setting.  As I got to my front yard I could no longer see the silver light, however as I looked into the west I saw an orange colored cloud (from the sunset) off to the west.  As I looked at this cloud, I saw a gold colored ball appear.  It appeared to drop from the cloud (the best way I can describe it is like when a plane, coming out of a cloud, kind of fades into view)then travel in a northerly direction and then just flash out as if someone had turned off the switch (it could have re-entered the cloud cover, but I'm not sure of this).  At first I thought someone was burning and I was seeing embers flying through the sky except that you could clearly see them come out of the cloud and move toward the north.  About the third one I saw looked like it was moving toward the ground, then went back up and continued its flight to the north.  In all I watched about 10 of these gold balls of light.  At one point there were three in the sky at the same time each appearing to come out of the cloud and then moving to the north and disappearing.  Again, there was no noise, no flashing lights, just these gold balls appearing to drop from the cloud. The entire thing lasted 5 to 10 minutes maximum.  I have been an amature astronomer all my life and I have never seen anything like this.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
the light was at a very high altittude, but had very distinctive colors, It was moving at a very high speed due to the distance covered;2004-09-03 20:30:00;15 minutes;the light was at a very high altittude, but had very distinctive colors, It was moving at a very high speed due to the distance covered I thought at first it was a planet,but the lights and atmospher distortion did not fit that of planets I have observed. The colors of green red and yellow were distinctive. My husband was an Air Force navigator for 21 years and said it was not a planet, but an airplane coming into SeaTac airport. The light did not move as if it was on an approch. I observed it off our back deck between two trees that at distance of about 75-100 feet were about 3-4 inches apart. I watched thru binoclars because out telescope was not set up. The light took about 15 minutes to travel the three to four inch distance between the two trees. It was heading almost directly east from the northern view from my deck. It was quiet obvious from the light distortion and the time it took to cover the distance between the trees that it was at a very high altittude, and yet the colors were very distinct. I don't know what crafts that are up there to explain this light;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

I was sitting on my couch facing the sliding glass door that looks over commencment bay. We actually were watching the Peter Jennings ABC speacial UFO's Seeing is believeing. We had waited all week for the show.  The show started at 8 pm it was at about 8:40 or a little earlier that I looked out the window. I had opened the curtains just incase something like this actually happend. My 4 year old was sick laying on the couch, My wife was holding our 4 months old in her arms sitting in the easy chair. She was facing the TV with her right side to the windows.  I looked out the windows and noticed a ball of light that was not moving but just sitting in the sky. I'm used to seeing airplanes flying in the sky out that same window. We are really close to McCord airforce base and Seatac airport.  The thing that caught my attention was that it was not moving but sitting still way above east Tacoma on the oppisite side of the water. It had a white light but also a orangiesh color. I ran and grabbed my digital camera and took a blurry shot of it. I sat and watched it for about 10 seconds. Untill it slowly faded away. At this time planes were flying in the foregraound and in the air.  I told my wife and she remained sittig n the easy chair holding the baby. I said that was wierd and sat down to watch the rest of the show.  About 5 minutes later I saw it again. This time I ran and grabbed our digital video camera. I took footage of it for over a sec. It then did that same thing that it did earlier and fadeed out of the night sky. I did not have my tripod so I went and grabbed it and but the canera on it. I told my wife If I see that again I'll be trippin!! Soon it appeared again. I got the camera and took about 2 seconds of footage of it untill it faded away again.  I have digitazed the footage and will send you a version of the full thing.  I'm not sure what is going on right now in our times and world but I feel that something is different. I've also ran into a lot of Nikola Tesla information lately and find that to be very interesting. He may hold a link to how this is acheivable.  I hope the footage is helpfull.  A.I.

Strange lights over McChord AFB, Tacoma WA;2007-01-04 23:45:00;4 minutes;Strange lights over McChord AFB, Tacoma WA My window in my bedroom faces to the south.  At around 11:45 on the evening of January 4th, 2007, I was just laying down for bed.  I happened to look out the window and spotted something that wasn't quite right.  My initial thought was that it was an airplane over McChord AFB.  We have constant overhead flights from the base.  After watching this object move slowly in a southeast direction towards or over McChord AFB I realized that it was not a normal craft.  This is what it looked like. Since it was dark and overcast I was not able to discern an actual outline.  The object was probably 7 or more miles away on the horizon but it was pretty good size.  There were dozens of white lights that were constantly flashing (twinkling) in rapid and non-uniform fashion.  It almost appeared like the lights were moving rapidly in a circular motion but I cannot say for sure.  All of the lights were white.  Every aircraft I have watched fly anywhere in the area would have no more than 7 or 8 lights (multi-colored) on it at any time and if they flashed it was in a constant rhythm. I watched this craft come to a stop and hover for about 30 seconds when every light shut off completely and it appeared to disappear.  I figured then that it was just something that could probably be easily explained and was turning to go back to bed.  After about 15 seconds of darkness the lights came back in the same position and the craft started to slowly move off in a southwesterly direction towards Ft. Lewis.  This lasted for about a minute when it sped off and winked out.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

As I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette I looked up at the sky, watching the clouds zip by the moon. I have done this for years, but not like this.From the upper right of my line of vision, over the moon, a white light came in fast, at a downward angle moving from right to left. I'm used to lots of military planes being near the base, but this made no noise came in fast and then stopped. it sat completley still for about 15 seconds. It then shot straight up and then stopped again. It just sat there for about 20 sec. and then zipped around in a box like formation moving incredibly fast and making dead stops. It was this time when I took out my cell phone and took a picture. It shot straight up about 30 sec. after I took my picture, up and out of sight. The picture came out really quite well, and I still have it.  I just can't figure out how to get it from my phone to online. If anyone knows how, I'd love to know. I went inside and told several friends who looked at me like I was nuts, I showed them the pic, and they are still not sure. I know what I saw was not one of ours.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

Horizontal lights hovering over Commencement Bay;2007-07-16 23:45:00;3 minutes;Horizontal lights hovering over Commencement Bay On the date and time listed above, my fiance and I noticed a very bright light hovering steadily in the sky over Commencement Bay in Tacoma, Washington.  My best estimate puts the object(s) at around 20,000 feet.  I was able to view the light through a set of binoculars (inexpensive, used primarily at the ball park) at which time I noticed that the light was actually comprised of three glowing lights in a perfect horizontal row.  By the time my fiance looked through the binoculars, she reported seeing four lights, then a brief red dot flashed at one end of the formation.  Immediately thereafter, the lights moved south at what appeared to be high speed, before disappearing.  Neither of us have ever witnessed anything like it, so we wanted to report it to someone who might be more experienced and better-equipped to process the information.

Strange lights above Tacoma, Washinton.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible aircraft lights, we wonder.  McChord AFB is nearby.  PD));2007-11-25 22:20:00;30 MINS;Strange lights above Tacoma, Washinton. To whom it may concern:  I was just reviewing your site about sightings in Washington State.  I came across the report of the light in the sky above Tacoma, Washington and wanted to inform you that I saw the same light on numerous occasions about every night from August to November.  At first I wondered what it could be, my first thought was a UFO or some other type of object.  The object would sit in the sky for about 10 - 15 minutes and then disappear for about 10 minutes, but only to reappear.  It would only reappear in the same exact spot as it did before, as if it hadn't moved at all and was slowly flashing.  I called a couple of people and from the information that I have gathered, this light is not a UFO at all.  We have two military bases up in the Tacoma area who do nighttime exercises about 20 days out of the month.  The lights in the air were possibly flares that were calculated to be shot up into the same spot each time...they are like a delayed flare that gives dark areas bright light and just enough visibility during nighttime engagements for about 10 minutes and is a slow burning flare.  This could have possibly been what the other people have seen.  I used to live on a hill in Tumwater, Washington where I could see the light quite well. Unfortunately, I don't live up there any longer and the place I live now is surrounded by trees so I cannot tell if the light is still visible on dark/clear nights.

Bright orange steady light over Tacoma, Washington.;2007-11-25 22:20:00;30 minutes;Bright orange steady light over Tacoma, Washington. At about 10:20 p.m. on 11/25/07, a co-worker and I saw a steady orange light directly overhead, it slowly moved to the west and came to a stop.  It covered about 45 degrees of the sky in about 10 minutes and was completely silent.   I looked at it through binoculars and saw what looked like a very faint triangular shaped object with a bright orange steady light in the middle.  From about 10:30 p.m. to about 10:45 p.m. it traveled northward.   My co-worker says it continued heading north and climbing higher until he could just barely see it anymore.  By about 10:55 p.m. it was gone.  Not much could be seen besides just a bright steady orange light.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

It was heading in a straight direction when all of the sudden a bright flash of light appeared from where it light was moving in the sky.  All of the sudden it took off in another direction and as you watch it it became dimmer and dimmer as if it was flying higher until you could not see any longer.  My wife witnessed it as well and suprised by it as well.  I checked all of the online schedules for many of the different space agencies and did not see anything that was scheduled for taking off that night.  I also did the research to see if it was an iridium satellite flare as you suggested peter.  It definitely did not look like that at all.  This was definitely different than anything I have seen happen in the night sky.  I see objects in the sky that appear to be most likely satellites and the space station that move in a constant speed in the sky on the same path.  Never have seen something like this going one direction then moving in another after the flash.  Very strange.  My wife was speaking with her boss and she and her husband just so happen to see the same thing.  I have never reported anything before and this is my first time.  I definitely will continue looking up!;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Orange, slow-moving light, appeared to backfire and shoot out flames/sparks.Stopped at some points.;2008-10-12 19:20:00;Approx. 7 min.;Orange, slow-moving light, appeared to backfire and shoot out flames/sparks.Stopped at some points. My husband was yelling outside for me to come join him.  I ran out in the yard, and it was dark at this time.  We saw an orange light, maybe 1,000 to 1,500 feet up in the air.  It was very slow-moving.  It looked like a Roman Candle fireball, but it was too high up, too bright, and too slow.  It seemed to stop at certain points, and proceed toward in the direction that the Narrows Bridge is in.  What was strange was that the craft seemed to backfire several times, or it was shooting little sparks or flames.  We could see these fall down from the craft.  As it got further from our sight, it appeared to pick up speed.  It lingered about 5 minutes or more.  I still couldn't find my camera in time.  We lost sight of it in a blanket of clouds.  It was unnerving.  My husband is a full-time laborer, I am a part-time retail clerk, our two children are 9 and 7.  As we were watching it, a neighbor came out and saw it, too.  He just stood there, quietly.  We are fairly new to the neighborhood, and don't know our neighbors well enough to properly describe them.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

Two of three lights in what appears to be a constellation drift off and disappear in Tacoma, WA;2010-10-19 19:00:00;5-10 seconds;Two of three lights in what appears to be a constellation drift off and disappear in Tacoma, WA I was heading south on S. Cedar St., traveling past Tacoma Central, when I looked up towards the moon.  The moon was close to full in the east, with what I assumed to be a planet below and slightly to the left of it.  There were two more lights, less bright, that formed a slightly acute triangle with the planet (Jupiter, perhaps?).  Initially, the formation looked like nothing more than a constellation however, after less than a second, I noticed the two bottom lights begin to drift away from the planet, breaking the triangular formation.  I lost sight of them when they were blocked from view by the old Costco, now a police station.  When I cleared the police station they were gone. The time was approximately 7pm. I would love to know if anyone else saw this phenomenon.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Light orb reconnaissance;2011-02-07 16:30:00;10;Light orb reconnaissance My roommate and I just got back from the Humane Society where we picked up a dog and I went to the back porch to smoke a cigarette.  I had remembered that earlier I had seen a rainbow, so I looked around in the clouds to see if it was still visible. It was not. Instead, I saw an orb of light moving around.  It seemed about the size of a small or distant plane flying, but it contained itself to a single area and maneuvered too quickly around to be a plane.  The event was occurring just above a line of trees, so I watched to see if it was a kite or something, but then I noticed another circle.  And in another few seconds another and another.  Soon (within 20 seconds of the first sighting) there were 7+ orbs flying around in that area.  None of them were rising from the ground, but gathering together from other parts of the sky.  All of them were flying around each other.  If these were kites, surely the strings would have tangled together and I would have seen them crashing to the ground. They did not. I have been reading different books about UFO's recently (Communion by Streiber, Redfern's Final Events, and a few books by L.A. Marzulli) so I'm not surprised that my first interpretation of the event was UFOs.  But, because the very name indicates ignorance, I kept watching to see whether these orbs would begin showing behavior typical of some explainable object.  They did not. They continued their dance in the sky and I continued to watch them.  I had no other camera on me but my phone camera, which would not have been able to zoom in close enough to capture an image of these orbs.   After 8-9 minutes, I went inside and called for my roommate to Come, see this!  I had hoped for another eye-witness to this event.  I went back outside and turned my attention back to the sky, but to my dismay, all but one had disappeared and just as my roommate stepped back onto the porch, that one flew into the cover of the clouds and could no longer be seen.  The rainbow was again visible, however.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

In 2005 in Tacoma, WA. a man walked up to me, I believe he was from the department of Defense, DOD, I have never seen him before, but his message was, why we had not been back to the moon, he told me that  there is a glass dome on the planet and we are to stay away. I told him my story about 1979, a story that is very real and a story that I will never forget.  He said that I was visited by (Pleiadians), Cool this explains why I am an Electronic Eng. and at one time was trained in Micro wave Technology for SAM’s. I grew up on the top of a hill all I do is monitor the skies.  I am curious about the two bright Orange lights flying in tandem one at a higher altitude then the other.  I watched them as I always watch air craft my whole life.  Orange, I have never seen orange, and then they disappeared in front of me, in clear skies.  I do not believe that they turned, they just disappeared. Question is were they drones.? I also witnessed a large meteorite cross the sky in front of me in Utah in 1984.  I have also seen a translucent light move across the night sky that was weird. I am interested in the orange lights if anyone can explain them.  Thanks;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Two very bright square flashing lights;2012-09-17 20:45:00;45-50 seconds;Two very bright square flashing lights As my wife and I were sitting on our back deck looking towards the SW we both saw two bright square flashing lights. It was as if they were LED lights. They blinked with no other lights. We also heard what sounded like jet engines, but the sound was behind the flashing lights by about two seconds. The sound was quiet not the usual jet engines you normally hear.  We are right in the flight path of Sea Tac and McCord so we see a lot of plane traffic.  I have been an airplane watcher for over 35 years and have never seen anything like this.  We watched it fly from the SW to the North.  Again very strange square lights!;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

I said it is!  This time they were flashing with no sound at all behind them like last night.   Also I should point out they were flashing in some kind of sequence and then they would change the sequence they would flash. Then one light then another would flash.  Again in the same direction as last night (9/17/12) they went from SW to the North. It lasted the same amount of time 45-50 seconds at the same time as last night.  These lights were square and parallel to each other.  So when we saw them it was from their side then we could see the rear of the lights with no other lights on what so ever.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Single low flying/floating/gliding ORANGE light in sky;2012-11-05 22:20:00;5 minutes;single low flying/floating/gliding ORANGE light in sky I was driving home from work as usual. This occured between 22:15-22:25 PST. I was driving in a northerly direction, about 14 blocks away from my home when i noticed an orange light. At first glance i assumed it was a plane or aircraft of some kind. Then as I got closer, about 10 blocks away i noticed the light was still there, and it was rather large, not small like a plane light. I then as i was driving, I started watching for it to blink or fade away or turn like most planes in the area do. There were no other lights or aircraft lights or anything in the sky during this time. When I first saw the light it was a little to the left of the road i was driving on, during the day there is a large tree at the end of the road where i turn and it was in that area. as I got closer the light had moved to the right side of the road. When I was about 8 blocks from home and still observing this light i decided to pull over to the side of the road because this was simply something i had never seen before. It was a VERY clear ORANGE light. Not flickering or flashing. It was roundish, maybe a little more oval than round, but overall just an VERY orange light. At the time i thought it was a paper lantern for 2 reasons: #1 because it was SOOO low to the ground..maybe 200 feet up. Maybe a little higher, it was night time so judging distance was hard but it was a large light (street lamp size) so I assumed it was rather near to the ground..much closer/lower than i've ever seen a plane or even a helicopter. and #2 reason was because of the way it was moving. It wasnt moving at a fast speed like i would expect an aircraft or helicopter to move. In fact it's movement was more of a floating/gliding. However the longer i watched it the more i knew it was not a lantern, because it was a clear light, there was no lantern for a flame or anything to be encased in. It was a clear, orange light that was not flickering like a flame would. It was also very silent, i could not hear it passing by. there were no engines or blades or cars or music or any other type of noise. So when I pulled over the light floated to the left side of the street again, passing over the road, but i could not see a shape associated with the light, just the light..and it just slowly meandered across the houses and trees to the left of the road, 1-2 blocks over. there are about 2-3 blocks on the left side of the road then there is a cliff going into the Puget Sound.  I watched the light for about 2-3 minutes while i was pulled over.  I would expect a normal aircraft/helicopter would have passed out of my line of sight during 2-3 minutes and would be heading off wherever it was meant to be but after 2-3 minutes i got a little freaked out that I didnt know what this light was so i drove the rest of the way home.  I did not see the light again after i drove off. As for my background/description:  I am not the kind of person looking for UFOs or strange sightings, i have never tried to see things like that.  I am deeply interested in astronomy and when it's not raining/cold outside i usually have my telescope out in my backyard looking at the stars/moon, however i have never seen an object that i could not identify.  Other than a few meteors i havent seen anything unusual in the skies during the past month or two here.  I still dont know what i saw except that it was like NOTHING i've ever seen and i've been looking at the stars all my life.  It wasnt until i described the situation to a pilot friend of mine that i thought it might be a UFO because he told me that there are no orange lights in aviation.  That is how i came across this website and why i decided to share my experience.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

Morphing Ambient Glowing Cloud Sky Ghost;2019-08-13 00:23:00;2 minutes;Morphing Ambient Glowing Cloud Sky Ghost I pulled up home way later than I thought from checking out the place I’m moving into in a week, as I was driving up downtown from a street exit up 15th st I noticed this small tiny bread crumb shape looking glowing cloudish thing right over the moon..  As I was driving I kept an eye on it because it just seemed so out of place.  No other clouds around like it except maybe more on the horizon.  What caught my eye is that it was changing shape, almost dancing in a very graceful way around the top of the moon.  I’m not religious but I could say it looked like a huge angel.  I have seen insane ufos in a huge group in Ohio and this was probably even more weird than that.  It wasn’t a solid “craft” or “vessel” of any sort but something that could be literally not of this physical world.  When I frantically Called my friend who’s house I just left by the time I turned onto my block it had whisped away, like a sky ghost or something!!

Multiple lights over Puget sound;2020-10-16 06:15:00;10 minutes;Multiple lights over Puget sound Took my dog outside for her morning walk before I leave for work like normal. I looked up to the sky’s, it was a clear morning, no clouds or fog. I notice what looked like stars but moving across the sky. There were more the could count. They were all moving In The same direction, coming from the south headed north (Lakewood area traveling north directly over the gig harbor bridge). I remember seeing some brighter then Others and some moving faster also. Not sure what it was but this isn’t the 1st time seeing this. I have seen this same anomaly 3xs now. Not as many lights before but moving in the same direction south to north over the bridge. Also they were all at different times all while it was dark outside. And within the past year.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
