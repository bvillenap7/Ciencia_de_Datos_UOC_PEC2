Cloud;2002-06-09 13:45:00;15 min;Just a disc shaped object that I watched for about 15 minutes. Object moved around in the sky and there was aircraft in the area. Clouds went past it and it moved around. This is not the first object like this I have seen. I actually came here to see if any one else had reported seeing it. It was the kind of thing that if you were not looking you would have never noticed. Once you knew it was there you couldn't miss it.  Kind of the same as one I saw about 6 years ago. Only that one I had my binoculars and showed it to another person. The person I showed it to was an ex-marine from WWII. All I did was point it out and their reaction was to say, I wish we would shoot one of those down. I am a little frustrated in that I have seen at least 4 different ones over the years and have no way to explain any of it. And that most people (includes me) can go about their everyday lives with this right on the edge of sight. At any rate I'm glad to unload a bit of this. If you look you will see. Take care, me Hey, I see you are in my backyard. Didn't you see anything? See what I mean? Please feel free to contact me via email if you have any questions or answers.

3 silent objects flying at extreme speed, first resembled tiny stars but loomed larger as out-of-focus, orange oval lights;2006-08-19 21:30:00;5 to 7 seconds;3 silent objects flying at extreme speed, first resembled tiny stars but loomed larger as out-of-focus, orange oval lights Let me preface this by saying that I've never ever seen anything in my 30+ years that could not be satisfied with some kind of reasonable explanation.  I've never before seen or experienced anything that I felt was convincingly supernatural, extraterrestrial, etc.  I am open-minded but skeptical I am willing to accept the possibility of just about anything being true, but I need to see some hard, scientific evidence.  I majored in biology in college, I work in a medical laboratory, and I am certainly not a flighty person.  Two days ago I would have laughed at the thought of posting a UFO report on the web, and yet here I am.  This all took place last night, Saturday, 8/19/06, at about 9:30 pm in Tacoma, WA.  It had been sunny and clear all day, and the night sky was clear too.  It was warm in the house, so I went out onto my deck in the backyard for some cool air. I reclined in the lounge chair on my deck, facing southeast.  I looked up at the stars, as I like to do, and noted that I could see more stars than usual.  Suddenly, I noticed out of the corner of my eye some movement in the sky directly above my head.  I focused my eyes on the object(s) and at first interpreted what I saw to be a shooting star (by the way, my vision is 20/20).  But then I noticed that there were 3 of them, traveling together (2 were close together, side by side, and the third was slightly ahead (i.e., south) and east of them).  I thought, Wow, 3 shooting stars?  They were at this point so far away that they appeared exactly as tiny stars lightyears away, and they were moving as fast as shooting stars.  Not slowly like satellites - they were moving at great speed.  I watched these shooting stars for a second or two, waiting for them to burn out.  But they didn't.  They did not burn out.  In fact, they grew larger in appearance as they traveled and presumably grew closer to the Earth.  What started out looking like tiny white stars shooting across the heavens quickly increased in size until they were maybe 100 times larger than they first appeared.  As they loomed larger their appearance also was transformed, from tiny white specks to, eventually, much larger ovals that were light orange in color.  What's interesting is that as they enlarged they became more out of focus.  It was difficult to distinguish the exact shape or form of these objects, because they appeared as light only (not terribly bright, and not glowing or radiant light -- it was more self-contained), and were so out of focus.  Not blurry or hazy or furry, but out of focus, as though they were traveling so fast that their light was reaching my eyes at a slower rate than at which they were moving.  That's the only way I can describe it.  I know that nothing travels faster than light, but I imagine that, if something were able to move faster than light, this might be what it would look like.  My brain struggled to assign a shape to their form:  oval is what came to mind but this is not entirely accurate.  They were somewhere in between oval, disc-shaped, and boomerang-shaped.  There was no flashing light, no trail behind them, no beams, and absolutely no sound.  I watched these 3 objects travel across the sky heading south, weaving back and forth slightly (side to side) as they moved.  Then they seemed to swoop down and then continue on in a southwest direction.  Even though they wove from side to side slightly, they maintained their basic formation (basically lined up along an east-west axis, but with 2 close together and one slightly ahead).  At one point, as they flew off into the southwest direction, the 2 that had been closer together moved apart and then returned back together.  They moved extremely quickly and effortlessly across the sky, with great ease and fluidity they appeared to be extremely agile, smooth, powerful, and with a definite sense of direction or destination (they were not traveling along a rigid trajectory, or meandering or switching directions or moving randomly).  Their flight path was fluid they appeared to swoop down across the sky, from outer space towards our atmosphere, and then they continued on heading south west.  I watched them until my view was obscured by the roofline of my house.  I jumped up and ran to the edge of my deck to see if I could catch another glimpse of them, but they were gone.  All of this took place in the span of about 5 to 7 seconds.  As I watched this all unfold, I felt scared, sick to my stomach, awe-struck.  I was overcome with an awareness that I was witnessing something not of this world.  I've been racking my brains for some earthly explanation for these objects, that can travel and change altitudes and weave back and forth at tremendous speed, with such agility, all in complete silence.  I've never seen a quality of light like that emitted from those objects as they drew closer.  My heart was pounding.  I called people excitedly on my phone, to tell them what I had seen.  I sat out on my deck for some time afterward, searching the sky.  I was scared but felt almost ecstatic to have witnessed something so incredible.  I imagine that others must have seen it too, and I hope that they'll report it.  And if there is some reasonable, earthly explanation for what I saw, I'd like to know what it is.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Yellow oval UFO exits cloud bank above Snolqualmie Forest foothills and disappears in cloud to South.;2008-01-25 16:40:00;5 to 10 secs.;Yellow oval UFO exits cloud bank above Snolqualmie Forest foothills and disappears in cloud to South. I was stopped in the right turn lane, two or three cars back from the stop bar looking east at the intersection of 38th St. and Pacific Ave. in Tacoma, WA.  It was approximately 4:40 p.m. and the weather was overcast with some sunbreaks but mostly low, billowy gray and white clouds and a light gray cover that completely obscured the Cascades and Mt. Rainier from my view.  As the traffic began to move, I saw a yellowish orb (shaped like a tic-tac from my vantage point.) exit a gray cloudbank to the north, and move at a constant velocity and altitude above what I presume were, the foothills of the Snoqualmie forest in the Enumclaw vicinity.  Within seconds of seeing the object, I made a quick glance to my right to make my turn onto Pacific Ave heading south. I looked to the east and fortunately I was able see it again, between the telephone poles, in about its last 1/3 of visible travel before it entered a white cloud bank to the south.  I had no time what so ever to try to grab my cell phone camera and miss the opportunity to witness and/or try to identify what I was seeing. I estimate the distance from my vantage point to the object at approximately 15 to 20 miles, (using Google Earth).  At that distance, I could not make out any surface features, hear any sound, or observe any contrails or changes in its color, shape, or trajectory.  When the object disappeared into the white cloudbank, I immediately looked at the clock in my truck, which is accurate to a minute or so.  It was 4:40 p.m.   I started to write down this info as I drove south down Pacific Ave.  From my vantage point with the hills visible behind it, the objects trajectory and size reminded me of one of many film clips I have seen countless times on television, of jet aircraft flying nearly nap of the earth, dropping ordinance with the desert hills in the background.  In contrast, less than 5 minutes down the road at the intersection of 72nd and Pacific, I looked up and saw a 727 looking jet liner very high in the sky, but obviously low enough to clearly recognize as an commercial aircraft.  I grew up in Lakewood WA, very close to McChord AFB.  I have observed many aircraft fly at varying altitudes around Tacoma for over 30 years.   I soloed a crusty Cessna C-150 at Shelton Airport in the summer of 1986.   I became proficient at recoqizing aircraft, especially F-16s, F-15s and F-18s by their vertical stabilizer orientation at very long distances.  I feel I would have recognized the profile of the object as a fighter jet or a light plane at that distance except that it travel much to fast to be a light plane.  Also, even though there may have been a break in the clouds, a glint from an aircraft windscreen does not look like a yellow orb.  Fighter Jets don’t fly along the Snoqualmie Forest.  My conclusions are that it was either:  1) Ball Lighting 2) Super secret Boeing aircraft developed over the decades from captured Nazi plans and prototypes. 3) An example of the yellowish appearing, cigar / orb shape UFO seen and filmed throughout recent history.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Oval-shaped craft blinked out of the sky;2011-07-05 15:30:00;1 minute;Oval-shaped craft blinked out of the sky I was close to Giaudrone Middle School, when I looked up and saw an oval-shaped craft that apeared to move like an airplane.   Seconds later, the aircraft gradually got smaller until at last, it just blinked out of existence.   I don't currently know of any known earth based aircraft exhibiting the behavior last seen, so to me, this is still a mystery.

A large rounded craft with bright white lights moving south at a low altitude.;2012-08-22 22:30:00;3 minutes;A large rounded craft with bright white lights moving south at a low altitude. At 10:30-11:00 I looked west out of our second story bathroom window. This is also close to Mcchord AFB.  I saw a large craft that appeared to be oval in shape.  There were very bright white lights spaced intermittently around the edges.  I saw it from a side view as it slowly moved south. Tbe craft was much lower than the normal planes that frequent the area. I heard no sound.  There were no flashing or strobe lights.  While it moved south a normal plane came from the west heading east. It was at cruising altitude, much higher than the unknown craft.  The plane also had it's strobe lights on. The craft continued south at a low altitude until it was out of sight. It moved quite slowly.  I am very familiar with the aircraft in this area having lived here for over 20 years.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

It was brightly glowing orange orb that brightened and dimmed but the light never actually blinked.  It was going from West to East toward Idaho over Tacoma, WA.  It seemed to stop once it was directly overhead of our house for about 20 or 30 seconds , then accelerated and disappear in a matter of seconds.  It was hard to judge its altitude it looked like the distance of a airliner possibly but with no sound.  The witnesses were my dad and I, we have lived in this house for about 12 years. I am a 30 year old male and my dad is 56. we take no medications and were not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.  This is the 3rd time we have seen this same light.  we saw it on July,3rd 2012 and July,4th 2012.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

They then rose and flew opposite my direction.   After a while the orb seeming lost some lumenessence and they then appeared to have inner structure.  This was only noticeable after they moved away, and until they vanished from sight.   Almost instantaneously, another orb rose straight up and the same event happened again.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309

At 13:00 09.07.15 Sunday, I looked up into the southern sky off of my patio and saw am apparent falling object in the sky with two smoke trails coming from behind it. I took several photos of the unknown object and then video taped the object I witnessed seemingly falling from the sky. The duration of the event was about 25 seconds at most. The object appeared to be dark in color and smoking as though on fire and was as bright as the moon during the day on a full moon. There was no sound at all during this sighting. As my vide linked here below demonstrates, the object fell behind trees and did not appear to break apart - it did appear very large and as though it was an oval mass without distinction in shape or form. I have never seen a thing like this. Here is my video link - please don't post my video anyplace to the net as I have newsmedia interested in paying to use it and KOMO TV NEWS in Seattle last night already used my video footage - they paid for its use and it was featured on the 11pm news last night.
