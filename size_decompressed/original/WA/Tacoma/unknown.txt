Work crew on railrodad loading dock witness approx. 9 obj. in loose formation streaking  north.  Good sighting.;1995-02-07 20:35:00;5-7 sec;Three men were standing on a railroad loading dock.  They observed approximately nine objects in loose formation abreast, which were flying north.  They called the sighting to the attention of the foreman, who may have witnessed it, as well.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Huge slow moving, humming craft.;1999-06-30 02:00:00;4 min.;Huge slow moving, humming craft. This event took place last summer. There was a very thick, low cloud cover. My husband and I were in the house watching television. We became aware of a loud humming overhead. It was unlike anything we have ever heard. We jumped up and went outside and looked up. We couldn't see because of the thick clouds. But we could tell the craft was just above the clouds. It was moving over our house, very slowly. It was very, very large...the size of half a football field. No turbines, no props just a humming that was vibrating. It slowly passed over the house in the direction of McChord Air Force base which is approximately 10 miles away.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
At about 3 PM on Sunday afternoon a friend and I were lying in the backyard doing a crossword puzzle and I just looked up into the sky,;2002-06-09 15:00:00;5-10 mins;At about 3 PM on Sunday afternoon a friend and I were lying in the backyard doing a crossword puzzle and I just looked up into the sky, a bright, clear, blue sky, and saw what appeared to be stars.  I thought this was very strange - could they be birds, seed pods, planes, and kept asking my friend if he could see them.  He could not see anything. There were probably 40 or 50 stars moving slowly toward the east - they were forming different patterns as they moved (circles, chevrons, orion). At one point a plane flew across the sky below them so they were pretty high.  The movement of these objects was sideways and backwards and circular and they formed patterns.  I don't know of any birds that fly that way or seedpods that would be visible at such a high altitude. I have very good vision, have flown quite a bit and have never seen anything like this before. I am also a skeptic but I was totally blown away by this.  After I watched these stars for about 5-10 minutes they simply faded up into the sky as if they were moving away and upward.  Has anyone seen anything like this? ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found her to be quite lucid in her description of the event.  She apparently has considerable experience in the aviation industry, as well.  PD));47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Tacoma/Puyallup - Light that moved & changed color;2003-09-28 04:00:00;Several hours;Tacoma/Puyallup - Light that moved & changed color Looking from HW16 near the Gig harbor bridge, towards the right (guesstimate: about 10 degrees) & above of Mt. Rainier - There was a Strobing light that at first glance looked just like an extremely bright star. However, it changed colors from white to bright blue, red, green. It hovered for quite some time making quick erattic movements from time to time (up, down, left,right - which ruled out it being a star, plane or helicopter) but overal stayed in the same location. Could not see visible shape, determine altitude or location over which it hovered - could have been Puyallup area.  With binoculars the object still was too far away, but was able to make out more colors, and the object almost seemed to 'sparkle' with light beams. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for the report, and for your telephone call.  My suspicion is that you may have been observing the very bright and colorful twinkling star in the western sky.  I have been admiring it, of late, too.  The apparent movement of the object is a result, principally, of movement of the eye, not the star.  This type of movement is reported to us frequently.  Please check that same are of the sky on the next clear night, and let us know whether you see the object, or not.  Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!  Dear Mr Davenport,  ((RESPONSE)) Thank you for getting back to me. The more I think about it the more I am getting convinced it must have been a star (though I've never seen any star like it). It just didn't make sense to me why I would be able to see it for hours while most reports lasts a few minutes at most. If it hadn't looked like it was moving I probaply would have just thought of it as a really bright star - and your explanation on why it seemed to move makes sense.  After reading up on some of the other reports on  the board, someone mentioned the sirius star which I think would've been in that general area at that time.  I will try to look again - with a star map in hand this time! (it's been cloudy last couple of days as you probaply know :) ) and if I find out it was indeed just a star I will let you know so you can remove the report.  Thanks for your time!

We thought we saw a meteor trail, it changed direction, turned into a light and dissappears over Tacoma;2014-10-09 18:15:00;30 seconds;We thought we saw a meteor trail, it changed direction, turned into a light and dissappears over Tacoma At 6:15 pm my son and I were returning in our boat from a day of fishing.  We looked West over Maury island and saw what we thought was a meteor falling at angle and leaving a bright trail.  The trail stopped, the object went sideways and started another short fall with another bright trail.  The second trail was much shorter and going in a different direction. The trail stopped and a bright light came out of it, moved toward us and disappeared.  The trails turned to clouds and slowly disappeared.  I tried to film this episode but my IPhone was suddenly dead and would not turn on.   20 minutes later when I got home my phone was fine, I turned it on and it had 50% battery power.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
Star-like object, did not move, lights did not flash, there were probably at least 8 lights on it.;2015-03-18 22:00:00;10 minutes;Star like object, did not move, lights did not flash, there were probably at least 8 lights on it. I always look outside before I go to bed, and at 10 pm, I looked out and saw a large star like shape, dominantly red with white lights across Puget Sound looking toward Gig Harbor, (we are on the ridge looking over at Gig Harbor with Puget Sound between it).    The UFO did not move, but the lights glowed, as I watched for 10 minutes, and then went to bed.   I was a bit frightened as I had not seen anything like this before and did not go outside.  I thought it was a clear night, thought I did not see any stars, only the object in the sky.  I am quite sure it was not a star.  It was quite large.   I am continuing to look outside each night in hope of seeing this object again.;47.228371748879;-122.461572197309
