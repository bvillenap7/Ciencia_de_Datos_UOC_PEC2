Bright, white light with orange/red cylindrical protrusion extending from the bottom. Total silence of surrounding nature. ((ISS??));2012-06-18 23:20:00;3 minutes;Bright white light with orange/red cylindrical protrusion extending from the bottom.  Total silence of surrounding nature. Craft was moving from the northwest to the southeast at about 50-60 degrees from the horizon.  It was a very bright white light which was about the size of Venus in the evening sky but at a much lower altitude.  My first impression was a satellite but it was much too low in altitude.  I would estimate 20,000 feet or less but moved in a straight line and was very silent.  Wind was less than 5 mph from the southwest and the sky was clear. What really got my attention is the fact that I live in a very rural area with many cattle and at this time of night it is very common to hear cows bawling or mooing and there are ALWAYS frogs croaking.  It was dead silent the whole time I witnessed the light. I got my binoculars from my pickup and found the light and at that time also noticed it had a orange/red non blinking narrow cylinder type protrusion coming out the bottom of the white light.  The protrusion was about 10% the size of the main light but 3 times the length.   It then rapidly increased speed and quickly disappeared in the distance.  It did always continue on a straight line trajectory but again it was lower in the sky than say a commercial jet and a much larger mass of light.   Within seconds of disappearing the usual chorus of frogs started.  The light itself did not emit any noise nor did it ever blink or really change intensity.  The silence of the surrounding nature was eerie beyond anything I have ever witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of International Space Station, we wonder.  PD));46.6682;-118.8554
