My brother and I were sleeping outside in the summer.  I was about 11 years old and my brother 8 or 9 years old.  We watched objects about the size of the moon move in ziz zag paths, stopping without slowing down, and dissapearing throughout the night.  This happened aproximately 8 times.  We were too frightened to move.  It was a clear night with no clouds. This was no aircraft that I have ever seen.  the object was oval in shape, with a solid, yellowish radiance.  My brother and I aare both sane and can still recall the incident as if it was yesterday.;46.6682;-118.8554
