First thought was WOW that's a bright airplane!  5minutes later it had'nt appeared to move any.  I went to get my camera and binoculars, still in the same spot, was round with red blue/green and white flashing lights, either blinking in succession or rotating.  It was far west of me.  Odd thing is there was an exact duplicate of it NE of me as well, same size, same lights, same floating appearance.  I went back out tonight (Thursday) same time, 20:00 and holy smokes there they are!  Same spots, lights behavior everything.  Observed and photographed them again 'til around 11 when it got foggy, amazing.  Others have to see these things they're quite obvious.;46.2979;-122.6414
