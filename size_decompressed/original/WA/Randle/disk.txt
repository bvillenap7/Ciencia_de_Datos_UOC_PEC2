Every time we go to the mountains the UFO'S are flying in front of us, as if to get our attention.I seem to be the chosen one to be filming them. Has anyone ever before gotten five hours of video tape recorded? The vehicle is black and is hockey puck shaped. It darts and hovers through the sky and flys behind the trees and mountains. It's favorite place to fly is in a remote area of the mountains, where radar can't pick them up. What's the best camera to zoom in and still get a clear focus job? I need a high resolution camera and a radar on the roof,for double verification.;46.5492;-121.8555

I observed the craft with binoculars and it appeared to have windows all in a row along the side .the craft did not appear to be rotating but it appeared to be vibrating as it moved along. The craft was not making any noise. The craft was very large  and was flying at a slant. We observed it  until it disappeared over the horizon to the east;46.5492;-121.8555
