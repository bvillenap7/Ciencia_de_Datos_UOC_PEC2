A friend and myself where viewing the comet Hale-Bop Saturday  April 5th  near the Cispus River in Lewis County, WA.  We observed a object best described as a very bright light at a very low altitude about  5,000 to 6,000 ft moving in a horizontal trajectory towards Mt. Adams at a speed faster then a jet but not at a streaking speed,  both of us were able to run down the dirt road for about 200 yds while tracking the object across the sky.  I have never seen anything like this in the sky.  I have watched the skies for many years and what amazed us most, was that there was no sound at all, only frogs chirping.  If this was a plane we would have heard jet sounds.   I am a computer Instructor and my friend a painter what we saw that night is something we still cant explain.   We hope to update our story as we will be going back up this week to hopefully see more and get some answers to our question.;46.5492;-121.8555

We personally saw 50-75 enter.  They were in a perfect straight line, perfectly spaced apart maybe an inch to an inch and a half.  Heaed east.  Over the state of Washington.  We noticed a commercial plane closer to use.  This is was clearly different.;46.5492;-121.8555
