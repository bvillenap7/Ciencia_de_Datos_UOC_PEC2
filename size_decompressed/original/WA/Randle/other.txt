I was traveling south on highway 7, mid day, on my way to a camping site near Randle Washington. I was looking around enjoying the beautiful scenery when I noticed an object circling a cone shaped mountain to the east. The object was white, no lights, and appeared kite like,  the absolute shape was not identifiable because it didn't appear symetrical. At the distance I was at, the object would have appeared about a half an inch in an outstretched hand. It went round and round the cone in a sort of strange floating motion. The movement had characteristics like paper falling with that rocking back and forth motion or side to side motion, except this object wasn't falling. The object remained in a relatively horizontal flight path as the mean, but deviated up and down from the mean. I watched it circle several times and then disappear behind the mountain.;46.5492;-121.8555
