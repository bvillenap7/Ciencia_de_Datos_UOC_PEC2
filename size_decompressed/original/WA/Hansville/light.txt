At approximately 10 PM, I stepped outside onto our small deck and was facing south.  The night was clear and I could see many stars.  As I looked almost straight up, and a little south, I saw a bright white light moving from west to east.  When I first saw this light, I would estimate it was over Hood Canal.  As the light moved east, I compared the brightness of it to the surrounding stars and it was brighter than the brightest stars in my field of vision.  It literally looked like a star but was moving 2-3 times faster than a commercial jet would appear to be traveling at cruising altitude.  I also looked for any flashing lights around the white light and did not see any. I quickly stepped back in the house and asked my wife to come outside to see this light.  I stepped out side again and the light began to fade quickly.  My wife did not make it outside fast enough to see it.  The light went from bright white to undetectable in about 3 seconds.  At that point, I would estimate this object was over Puget Sound. I could not judge the altitude except to say it seemed to be at least 30 thousand feet overhead.  It was very quite outside and I did not hear any sound coming from this light as I would have had it been a jet airplane.;47.9039;-122.5657

The lights looked to be hovering in the vicinity of the Bangor Sub Base.  Three lights disappeared leaving three.   Soon the three lights became one and then disappeared.;47.9039;-122.5657
