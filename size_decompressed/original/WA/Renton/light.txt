A very long trail of smoke was emitted and I could see that this object was on fire. I viewed it for 2 to 3 seconds. At 12:40 am PST, I was sitting at a traffic light in downtown Renton Wa. when I looked to the west and saw an extremely large, bluish white fireball falling from the sky at a 75 to 80 degree angle. I viewed the object for 2 to seconds and it was so bright and large that I could see the white hot fire on this object. It was even bright enough to light up a very long trail of smoke that it was emmiting as it fell. After about 2 to 3 seconds, the object disappeared without a trace and I could no longer see the smoke trail that it left. If you are looking at the head of a pushpin held at arms length, that was the approx. size of the object. The object disappeard at about the same altitude as a small aircraft coming in for a landing. there is a small airport very close by so altitude is failry easy to guage.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Very fast, bright , non blinking red light, traveling north, no sound;2002-10-17 05:21:00;2 seconds>;Very fast, bright , non blinking red light, traveling north, no sound I want to share with you and others what I saw this morning in the sky as I was driving to work. I live in Renton, Washington. 10 miles south east of Seattle. At 5:21am this morning while approaching a stop sign a very fast, very bright Red light came into view in my windshield. I was facing north. The light come into view from the top left side of my windshield and left my view in the middle of my windshield when it passed behind a mountain 2 1/2 to 3 miles north of me. The light was visible for under 2 seconds. It came out of the South- south west and traveled to the North- north east. It did not blink, it traveled in a straight line, and I heard no noise from the inside of my car. Windows were rolled up and the radio was on. The light was two to three times as big as a typical light from a plane. No trail of light or bits of light were left behind as meteors often leave. I see dozens of planes in the sky around my house every day and night since I'm only 8 miles from Sea Tac International Airport. This did not look like a plane, nor did it act like a plane.  Seconds after the red light left my sight a planes lights came into view from behind the same mountain. The plane was flying toward the west and it seemed much higher in the sky and further away. Its lights were softer in color and much smaller. This was different, weird even. I watch the night skies several hours a months. Planets, meteors, comets, satellites, space stations, planes. I've seen them all and this red light was not like those. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness and found him to be exceptionally objective in his description of the object and sighting.  We suspect he is a very good source.  PD));47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Two objects flying at a great speed with ability to instantly alternate flying directions.;2002-12-01 21:00:00;7 minutes;Two objects flying at a great speed with ability to instantly alternate flying directions. On a visit to Renton, Washington, my sister and I observed two (2) objects flying parallel with each other.  At first we thought they were satellites, since we have previously seen satellites flying in the night sky at our home in California, but this time the objects were flying at a much greater speed than we have ever seen before and, also, the objects were flying in a straight line course then instantly changed their course of direction into an an east-to-west direction (for example, flying north-to-south, then instantly heading in an east-to-west direction).  Both my sister and I have over 30 years working for the Department of Defense and neither of us are aware of any aircraft that can instantly change directions such as what we witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  Error in date above.  We presume the witness implies a date in December 2002.  PD));47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

At first a thought it was a planet. I quickly glanched back up when I realized that it could not be a planet because it was not in the right place in the sky. AS I watched it went from a star burst 1/8 to 1/4 inch in diameter to nothing. It slowly faded out. The sky was mostly clear as I watched. A few clouds were drifting by at the time. Dozens of stars were visible at the time. A light haze(clouds) appeared around the light as it flared brighter then faded away.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
anomlous lights;2004-03-28 19:45:00;15 sec.;anomlous lights Mr. Davenport, I wasn't going to report this event but I just read on rense.com of someone seeing something very similar. On sunday, 28 March at 7:45 PM I was returning from a walk on the Cedar River trail in Renton. While crossing the softball field at the Renton community center I was taken aback to see two lights in the northern sky which I immediately recognized to be anomalous. They were in color and brightness very much like Jupiter. They were one directly below the other hanging motionless in the sky in an area a couple of degrees east of polaris and perhaps five degrees below polaris. They were separated by one or two degrees. After observing the lights for ten or fifteen seconds the lower light dimmed and disappeared  in three or four seconds then the upper one did the same. I don't think that these were flares - they did not resemble any flares that I've ever seen. I'm certain that they were not lights on an aircraft. Did anyone else see these things?;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

After 5 min or so they quickly changed formation and kept changing.  Then they disappeared.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Bright light in the sky over Ikea;2005-09-03 17:00:00;incomplete;Bright light in the sky over Ikea I was in the parking lot for Ikea and I was gazing up at the sky because it was such a beautiful day. I noticed that there was a small, but extremely bright, glowing light against the blue sky. It looked like an airplane light but it was not moving and for some reason it looked like it was up much higher than a plane would be, but i'm not really sure. The sky was so bright it seemed strange to see such a bright light in the sky. it's possible it was a planet, i guess, but i have never before seen a star or planet against such a very bright afternoon sky. no other stars or lights were visible in the sky.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

lights seen at night;2008-10-01 20:45:00;10 mins;lights seen at night 	I live in Renton, WA and On the night of 10/1/08 at around 8:45PM I obseverved what appeared to be 3 bright stars close to the horizon outside of a  SW window.  The stars seemed very bright and a soft yellow color.  After visually inspecting the stars for a few minutes a fourth star appeared.  I do live  near Sea-Tac and Renton Municipal airport and considered if these were oncoming planes but the objects didn't seem to move for more than five minutes.  Considering my suspicion I fetched some binoculars.  When I came back one of the objects had started to move in a northern direction and it had turned on a  red and green light which one appeared on each side of the bright yellow light.  After a few minutes another object turned on the same type of light and took  off in the same general direction.  And this repeated until all of the objects were gone.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
2 separate sightings within 5 minutes of each other;2009-09-21 22:15:00;10 seconds;2 separate sightings within 5 minutes of each other During my nightly walk with my dog, I noticed a bright, fast moving object in the sky.  It moved from north to south and low to the horizon.  I followed it for a couple of seconds and lost it behind a house.  It did not re-appear.  The object moved much faster than any normal aircraft and was much brighter than airplanes normally appear (it also did not blink).   I continued to watch the sky for another 5 minutes and then noticed directly above me a bright blinking light and appeared to be moving away from the earth.  It remained in the same spot in the sky, but became fainter and smaller over about 5-7 seconds.  I continued to watch the sky, but did not see anything else.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Two bright orange lights at high altitude, Seattle Wa;2011-09-10 20:54:00;<5 minutes;Two bright orange lights at high altitude, Seattle Wa Summary: Two bright orange lights at high altitude moving at moderate speeds from the SW heading E. No sound, no strobes. Lights traveled in same direction for about a minute, then one light stopped, for about 3-5 seconds then faded. Second light continued on same direction then made a slight and constant change in direction to the NE by E, then stopped and held position for about 1 minute, then faded. Brief description of event:  I was walking inside my house past the sliding kitchen door.  I happened to look outside and notice two bright orange lights moving high in the sky.  I was very interested because: 1) they were bright orange lights 2) they were in a position in the sky not at all typical for aircraft in the area and they were traveling in a direction not at all typical for aircraft in Seattle airspace. These were traveling east, which is across the typical flight patterns for aircraft at all altitudes (which are almost all N-S patterns). I opened the screen door and went out onto the deck and I waited, listened and focused on the lights as they got closer. My first reaction was maybe low altitude satellites, then I thought maybe air planes at great distance (explaining why I couldn’t see any strobes yet) then I thought maybe military or helicopter because of the flight path and flight characteristics (the lights slightly changed course). Then when one light suddenly stopped and faded away my t! houghts changed instantly and all thoughts went to unexplained lights. The second light continued east and then stopped in the sky and appeared to remained stationary. I took two pictures with my blackberry (they are not very good) while I called continuously to my wife. The light remained stationary long enough for me to enter my house on three different occasions to call to my wife. It faded right as she came outside – she did not see any lights. That’s the event. I am very curious now about what I saw. Please keep my email address and name private and confidential. Thank you.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Bright orb like light over sea tac dec 5 2011 21:00;2011-12-05 21:00:00;4 min;bright orb like light over sea tac dec 5 2011 21:00 About nine pm my roomie and l were on the deck smoking a cig.  Over towards the ridge of sea tac and tukwila was a bright light in the sky.  Just over horizon, about the same distance as a plane in landing mode.  The orb of light was a stand still for about four min.  The light was very bright and then would dim down to a tiny star size speck then get bright and full orb again.  It looked like it might have had some red.  And green lights spinning around it but the white orb was so bright.  I looked up on the internet if a plane can look like it is at a stand still and.  Found out yes but only if the plane and air are the same speed.   Planes were coming in for landings at the same time this object was in the sky.. I have tried to think of all logical explanations.  It was very strange.  It was also a very clear night so the light couldn't have been reflecting off the clouds to give the orbed look.  Four days earlier at the same time (9pm) my roomie and husband (I was as! leep) saw the exact same orb and l didn't believe them. Now I do. Since it was near the airport you could hear the planes but not the orbed light. It made no sound. Plz look into this. Thank-youit was also too dark to take pictures.  It only looked like a speck of light.  It did not do it justice.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Ball of light but it wasn't a plane.;2012-11-04 20:00:00;2 minutes;Ball of light but it wasn't a plane. I just pulled into my parking spot, and went to slide the sunroof closed, when a small orangish red ball caught my attention.  I live near enough to a major airport, and thought it might have been a plane.  As I watched it, I realized there were no other flashing lights on this orb, it was just a steady color, (and planes generally have flashing indicators on the outside, especially a blue light.)   As I watched it, it seemed to actually gain altitude, since it seemed to get smaller and a little dimmer.  As it was dark, it was unusually bright for city lights, and because it was cloudy and rainy, I knew I wasn't just watching stars.   I am generally a logical person, but I just have no explanation for this.  It went from SW to NE (towards the mountains) I would have watched it longer, but I lost it behind the heavier clouds.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

Bright, then slowly dimmed same time and rate. Moved like in orbit, one after the other same speed. My dad and I camped out in our backyard to star watch. We saw 2 lights. He says they were going North, and I say East.  We both agree they were two lights, at arms length about a tennis ball apart.  They were bright at first, then faded a bit simultaniously. They seemed to move like they were in orbit.  My dad wishes me to include that if it was just one, perhaps it was a satalite, but because the consistent moving bodies dimmed (but not disapeared) at the exact same rate, that it seems it is something unique.  The objects were traveling on the same path, not side by side.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

It did not appear to be over my neighborhood, but rather, it seemed closer to SeaTac airport or perhaps over Fairwood/Kent.  There was no noise.

Witness report: Star moving rapidly, erratically;2020-02-19 22:30:00;<5 minutes;Witness report: Star moving rapidly, erratically At approximately 10:30pm, I took my dogs outside to let them pee, in the yard. As I stood holding their leashes, I was looking up at the sky. To the south, I noticed a faint reddish star. I cannot explain why I took notice at first, but I can best express my thoughts in the moment as if the star was “out of place”. I watched this “star” for a few seconds, and it then rapidly, erratically shifted its position in the sky, from its original position to other positions in the same vicinity of the sky, returning briefly back to its original position, during these rapid movements, and coming to rest again in the original position after ~5 seconds of rapid, erratic movement. The “star” sat in the original position that I first took notice of it in for another moment, longer than the movement had lasted for. The star then moved from the original position again, in the same manner it had done previously - rapidly, erratically, seemingly randomly, and back to the orig! inal position again. This cycle repeated for less than 5 minutes. My dogs did not react to these events. I cannot explain any reason as to why I decided to take the dogs back inside and not continue my examination of this “star”. In the moment, I registered that I was viewing something strange, but was not alarmed by it.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
