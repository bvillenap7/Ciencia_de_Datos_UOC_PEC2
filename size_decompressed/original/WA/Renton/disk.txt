Disc Shape. 3 witnesses. Flight was a little wobbly.;1997-06-08 19:16:00;5-6 minutes;Summary : Disc Shape. 3 witnesses. Flight was a little wobbly. Sun lit sky, partly cloudy. Object appeared3-4 miles away approx 4000 ft alt. Disc shape.Large enough to distinguish dark bottom andmetalic topside. Flew from NNW to SE about20 mph. Wobbled side to side as it flew. Asit passed out of sight due to trees, it seemedto rotate. We used only the naked eye and laterbinoculars until it fell from sight. Sorry, nopictures. Too far away for detail. This was notan arranged or vectored sighting.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

it was a smooth silverish metallic object shaped like a dome- not exactly a saucer or disk- but a dome.;1999-06-01 12:00:00;1 minute;It was daylight with very few light clouds and mostly clear light blue skies.  It wasn't really sunny so that is why I think it might have been around or past noon.  I was at the age when my head could just only appear above a window pane that faces out of the front of my parent's two story house to the neighborhood street.  Because of this, I think I was around my pre-teen age. Anyway, I liked to look at the sky a lot, and these were just one of those days.  Something shiny caught my right eye. I focused my attention on it- it was a smooth silverish metallic object shaped like a dome- not exactly a saucer or disk- but a dome.  It was very far, but it was close enough for me to make out the shape.  I remembered seeing window-like texture on the side of the dome, but now I'm not sure I remember right.  It moved smoothly in a down to up-right curve, and continued to move farther to the right and away until I couldn't see past the window anymore.  I know this is not a false memory because at this time I told myself what I saw and tried to make excuses for what I saw such as perhaps the people were trying out new aircrafts.  Alas, I now know it's not possible. Also, I should note when I was little and around this age, I often heard a strange futuristic sound at night that reminds me of spaceship landing in the movies. This might be irrelevant, but I don't know what can explain that sound. I haven't heard the sound for a long time now- probably because I don't live at my parent's often anymore.

Fast-moving saucer-shaped white light;2002-10-12 19:10:00;3 seconds;Fast-moving saucer-shaped white light I saw one UFO moving very fast across the sky. I was in the military and I've seen A-10's moving at high speed and low altitiude, but this was the fastest I've ever seen anything move. What I saw was a little more than a half circle of light, with the brightest section facing the direction of movement, kind of like you would expect a meoteor to look as it was coming down through the atmosphere. It appeared about the size of a quarter from my perspective.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
flying saucer hovering between trees in my backyard above the power line (recharging, perhaps?);2004-08-16 04:44:00;6 minutes;flying saucer hovering between trees in my backyard above the power line (recharging, perhaps?) I turn off my TV, FINALLY, and I'm about to go to sleep, pulling up my blankets. And I see a bright light between these two trees. And I'm like yeah whatever, an airplane. and then it stays in that SAME spot, and I'm like..hmm..what is that. so I search in the dark for my glasses, and finally find them, and I put them on, and look back over, and it's still there. and I see little lights as well, and I thought well maybe it's just a glare. but then I see how clear they are. and okay, so there was one bigger and brighter light, and in a circle, there were little lights. So I jump up, whispering OH MY GOD! A FUCKING UFO! to myself. and I grab my camera, and by the time I turn it on and get it on the right setting, it's moved too far. but oh my gosh. I swear it was a UFO. and HOLY MOLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

At that time it looked the size of a sea gull at two hundred yards.  It came approximately my direction in a straight course heading due east.  I moved thirty feet into the back yard and kept it in my view, it passed over my residence to the north at 85 degrees above the horizon, still heading due east and not altering course or speed. It was a completely round craft and was glowing faint orange on the bottom.  At it's closest position to me it appeared the size of my little finger nail held at arms length. Completely round and flat, not like a ball, but like a disk, it had a gray rim. It had no lights just the faint orange glow under the whole craft.  It went out of sight at about thirty degrees on the easterly horizon again at that point it was about the size of a seagull at two hundred yards.  It made no noise and distinctly looked like a round flat craft, it was faster than any object I have seen in the sky except a shooting star, it took 15 - 20 seconds to cross my field of view, from west 30 degrees to east 30 degrees, and did not look like a satellite, space station, or plane.  The sun was just setting and the sky was mosly clear.I have now changed my concept of ufo's to It's possible.
