As I exited the house I was drawn by the lights in the North sky. The moon was full and stars were difficult to see. No clouds, air traffic at a low. 4 slow moving lights, from West to East. Streaming tails appeared to be 30 degrees long in the sky. The object(s) were at approx. 20 degrees above the Northern horizon. Others in a car stopped to ask me if I saw them and told me they watched them for 1 to 2 minutes at the top of the hill to the South of me. They confirmed a yellowish orange color and the long tails. Note: My magnetic, static, and subsonic detectors did not detect anything. They have in some past occasions.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

UFO's in Formation;2000-08-04 11:45:00;5-10 seconds;UFO's in Formation These two flying objects were wing-shaped, translucent, flying in a stepped down echelon to the right moving at incredible speed.  They were over a Blue Angel practice session on Lake Washington, flying from North to South, were visible only 5-10 seconds.  If they were of any real size (looked small) they were incredibly high. My first reaction were that they were birds, but no bird flys that fast and without flapping its wings.
