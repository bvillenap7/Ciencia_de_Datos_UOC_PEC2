It appeared to be similar to a shooting star with a bright, white head and an orange firey tale.  It traveled across the sky in a straight direction until it was out of sight. This evening while barbequeing in the backyard, I was on my 2nd story deck facing westward when I looked up and noticed an orange tail behind an object traveling at a fairly high rate of speed.(faster than a commercial jet) I stood there for a few seconds watching this thing heading towards the sunset. It reminded me of a high-flying jet with a vapor trail, except this trail stayed the same length as it traveled. The 'head' of the object looked like a very bright whitish color, kind of flashy while it was close, then only the bright orange tail was visible as it moved further away. It seemed to be turning gently more westward as it moved further away.  I would say it took maybe 4-6 minutes before it was completely out of sight, which I am guessing over the Olympic Mountains. My brother saw it through his binoculars and his best guess was that of a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere at a very shallow pitch. Or a metoer. He said he thought there might be a 'chaser' plane, too. He said it was hard to tell because the trees were in the way.  He is an engineer at Boeing in Everett and has some pretty good knowledge about aerodynamics.  I finally got my wits and grabbed my 35mm camera!  Took 2 photos at the 90mm telephoto setting.  It was pretty far off in the distance when I took the pictures.  I will get the film developed this week and scan them for you if they turn out!   Wow!  How exciting to see it.  (I work at Boeing also, 41 yrs, lived in the Seattle area all my life.);47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Green Fireball;1998-09-23 21:20:00;4 sec;Green Fireball I was driving southbound out of Renton, before the 212 exit, when I saw a brilliant blue-green (mostly green with a hint of blue.) ball of light with some yellow at the end of the tail.  It was much bigger and much much brighter than any star, but smaller than the moon (maybe 1/6th to 1/8th the size of the moon.  It looked like a bottle rocket except it was green and the angle wrong.  It was traveling from East to West, coming down at about a 45 deg. angle.  It lasted about 3 to 4 seconds.  It looked like it landed in north Kent.  It had all the characteristics and trajectory of a meteorite except it was a little slow for a meteorite, but I think that may be explained if it were moving toward or away from me.  It did seem to be low in the sky (I could see it at the top of my windshield and it ended up about half way down on the right side. I have seen one or two like it before in my life except they were not green.  It did not do anything funny like stopping or changing direction.  I think the green comes from copper material in the meteorite burning up.  My final conclusion:  It was a meteorite.  Probably the most spectacular one I've ever seen, certainly the most colorful.  When I got home about 2145 I called my flight instructor and told him about it.  Then I turned on my radio about 2218 and tuned into the Art Bell show and heard you guys talking about what I saw.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Saw a Fireball at 9:00 pm sharp north of Sea-Tac Airport.;2001-08-24 21:00:00;one second;Saw a Fireball at 9:00 pm sharp north of Sea-Tac Airport. Looking to the east from Chelsea Park, Wa. at 9:00 pm sharp we saw a fireball descending rapidly from North to the south at a steep angle. This area is north of the airport by a short distance,and though there was no trail, the angle of descent and speed of the fireball seemed much out of character for an aircraft. Immediatly following, our cellphone rang. Sister said she saw a green fireball, apparently at the same time, over Maury Island, Wa.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Green fireball over Renton, WA;2002-02-08 23:20:00;3-5 secs;Green fireball over Renton, WA I was talking with my girlfriend when I walked outside.  I was looking at the stars as I usually do when I thought I saw a shooting star.  It looked more like a probe but was moving alot faster.  Its color was almost light neon green.  From where I was standing it appeared over my left shoulder and relative to my position on the ground it seemed only about 200 meters up in the air.  There was no bang like that of fireworks, it did not make a sound at all.  I live in Renton and the object was moving east-southeast.  I lost it over the trees so I don't know if it vanished or kept on moving in that direction.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
EASTBOUND FIREBALL.;2012-07-02 23:51:00;90-120seconds;EASTBOUND FIREBALL FIREBALL on 01JUL2012  ((sic.  02JL12)) @ 23:51HRS   From my home in Renton, WA I observed a “fireball” about 1/6 size of the full moon, but larger than a star.  It moved slowly from the west to the east, soundless and flickering.  At first I had thought that it might be a meteor but it was under the cloud cover and going about the speed compared to a larger jet at 30,000ft.  I first noticed it almost straight up and slightly south.  I called my wife out to see as well. As it continued on, total of 90-120seconds, I looked for the red,green and white lights usually found on aircraft and saw none.  To me it looked like what a campfire would look like from a distance, only flying.  As it descended off into the east, disappearing either into the cloud cover or just vanishing, my wife noted that it had split off into 2 balls and appeared to have something connecting them.  I had noticed that when closer it seemed to have an orb of some sort around it, but that could have been like what you would see around a fire, hazy kind of orb, not sure how to describe it. We live 10 miles from Seatac Int'l Airport and 3 miles from the Renton Airport so we are not strangers to aircraft, shortly after this fireball disappeared, a jetliner crossed over head, above the cloud cover and I could hear it clearly.  As with the smaller craft, they can be heard for a time before and after visual contact is made.  This ball made NO sound at all.  Why I didn't think to take a picture is beyond me. Here is the info from the National Weather Service:   1 Jul 11:53 pm PDT WINDS :WNW    SPEED:  7    VISIBILITY:  9.00  I haven't yet been able to get the cloud cover elevation, but they were low, this morning they are high and the jetliners are at their usual elevation heading N, as they always do.  Last night they were above the cover. With the winds WNW and this thing heading damn near dead on east, I'm ruling out a Chinese balloon my friends keep trying to convince me it is. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite responsible.  We have corrected the date above.  The sighting occurred on Monday night, July 02, 2012, the witness reports.  PD));47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Fireball In The Sky!;2012-07-04 22:00:00;About 20 minutes;Fireball In The Sky! It was moving slow enough that we thought it was an aircraft of sorts but between the fireworks going off, we, the group of us, could not hear anything.  We shared binoculars to take a look at this spectacular light in the sky.   My daughter says she sees them frequently when she is out with her telescope checking out the stars.  I wouldn't say it was completely circular but more like a sideways egg that was glowing reddish-orange.  This lasted about 20minutes before it just glided away back into the atmosphere.  Oh yea and there were several aircrafts in the area since SeaTac is just across the valley from us.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

It was still dark out and there were no clouds in the sky.  I noticed a star and focused on it while I walking.   It looked brighter than normal.  I noticed the left of it, a red star or orb?  (smaller in size) merge into the star-then opposite end of the (right side) another star (still smaller in size and white) emerged from this side.  It happened in about 20-30 seconds.   I don't do drugs or drink.  I'm just a normal person going to work and noticed this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright Red light object with no sound moved slowly overhead from North to South.;2013-09-07 23:00:00;5 minutes;Bright Red light object with no sound moved slowly overhead from North to South My wife and I were on our patio in Renton WA last night somewhere between 10:30P.M. and 11:00P.M. We both saw this bright red light coming from the North headed South.  It appeared to be moving very slow as it took a long time to finally reach us. When directly overhead we realized there was absolutely no sound.  I surmise that whatever it was, was much higher than an airplane. It continued to head directly south.  I am wondering if it might have been a drone, but I don’t know if a drone would put off such a bright red light. The lack of any noise as it was directly over my head leads me to believe it was actually very high in the sky.  The light was a very intense red and I am surprised if there weren’t other sightings of whatever this was.  I have never seen anything like this before and do not think it was a satellite.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
