Was it;2003-02-07 18:10:00;5 minutes;Was it I'm an amateur astronomer living in Renton, Wa. (a suburb of Seattle), and on the early evening (dusk) of Feb. 07th, 2003, I was wating for the sky to get dark enough so I could do some star gazing with my binocs and telescope.  At about 18:20 I went out side to check the sky's darkness.  We had clear weather that day, so the sky was cloudless. I could see several major planets like Jupiter and Saturn shinning through the darkening blue skys, but no stars were visible yet.  From the back yard I looked over the top of my house and a bright object was flying at a high declination in the sky over my house.  It looked like the ISS (International Space Station) flying by Seattle, which it was scheduled to due on Feb. 7th.  So I got my binocs and followed it across the sky until it set in the east.  It approached from the west.  But when I checked the NASA ISS sightings web site, it said that the ISS Seattle flyover was scheduled for 19:24 that night, an hour and 15 mnutes later.  The only other thing I can think that it was, was the Russian Supply Ship Progress, which had been docked with the ISS since the Tuesday before, or it was something unexplained.  I sent an e-mail inquiry to NASA about went the supply ship was due to return to earth, but have not yet received a response.   Another possibilty is that the posted times on the ISS Sightings web site was in error, but I never found that to be the case in terms of the times ISS flies over Seattle..  Just was wondering if any one had any infomation on this in terms of whether this was the Russian Supply Ship Progress or the ISS, and whether anyone may have seen what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness witnessed, but the Heavens-above.com website states that it does not indicate those events which occur during daylight hours, or close to daylight hours.  Hence, the object may have been the ISS, and the flyover was not shown as being visible during the earlier pass.  We saw the ISS on the same night.  PD));47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
two flying objects appeared and disappeared  in to two different directions.;2007-07-04 22:15:00;4 min;Two flying objects appeared and disappeared  in to two different directions. Looking up in the clear night sky, looking at all the stars that were out, I watch this object move gently across the sky at half the speed this airplane was flying right below it and then it speed up and disappeared.   The distance of the plane and this object was totally to far from space and earth.   Not more then seeing this, this other object appeared and went the other direction of where this same object left.   This was very spooky.

Glowing orange elliptical object witnessed by 4 people in Renton, WA;2012-08-03 22:00:00;30 seconds;Glowing orange elliptical object witnessed by 4 people in Renton, WA UFO sighting in Renton, WA at approximately 10PM Friday night August 3, 2012    My husband and I were completing our block watch rounds in our neighborhood.  It was completely dark except for the street lights.  I looked up and saw an orange glowing elliptical object moving silently above the roof tops.  I alerted my husband, and he saw it, too. The object was approximately half the size of a full moon when directly overhead.   It moved at about the speed of a small plane and appeared to be at the same altitude as a small plane.  It appeared from the north and moved in a southerly direction until we could no longer see it.  The sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.  Although the object looked as if it were on fire, there was no smoke or smell.  It moved steadily with no sound. Our neighbor and her daughter-in-law were driving out of our complex, and we stopped them and had them observe the object, also. I looked on line and determined the wind that night was out of the north at 5 to 10 mph.  I called 911 and reported the sighting. My husband and I are in our early 60s, we’re both college graduates, and we’re retired. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with these witnesses, and they sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  PD));47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
