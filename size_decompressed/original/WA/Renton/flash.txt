Large White Flash above Renton;2001-09-20 23:00:00;1 second;Large White Flash above Renton. After reading some of these reports, I decided to discuss my own sighting.  Unfortunately I can’t remember the date, but I believe it was in 2001. I was driving on Maple Valley Highway near Jones Rd going west, at about 10:30 or 11:0p.m.  The sky was clear, and stars were visible. I saw something in my peripheral  in the upper right hand corner of the windshield.  It was some sort of light that moved strangely in the sky.  I glanced up and the moment that I did, I saw a bright egg shaped light that flashed and grew smaller within a fraction of a second.  It was like when you turn off an old TV and the light goes to the center of the screen, or a Sci-Fi movie where a spaceship zooms away at light speed. I distinctly got the impression that it had moved away at an incredible speed.  This would have been over Renton or 405 depending on the distance.  It happened so fast that I wouldn’t be able to judge its exact location or distance, but I believe it was at least a hundred feet up. The light was such a bright white that it left an imprint in my vision like when you stare at a light source for too long and you see a pink or green blob when you turn away.  I would have dismissed this whole event, had it not been for the fact that I could still see that imprint. I had a strong impulse to pull over and look in the sky in the direction it had gone, but there wasn’t a convenient place, as that stretch of road has no shoulder.
