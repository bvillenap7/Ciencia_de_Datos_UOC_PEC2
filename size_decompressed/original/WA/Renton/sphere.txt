At first it looked like a balloon in the far off distance, but then it just stopped and hovered.  I went downstairs to go outside and see it better.  I grabbed the binoculars and told my mom to come check it out. It started to move again to the  west, (coming from the north) in a straight line.  It then began to bob and weave in a way that no flying object I've ever seen or heard of.  Through the binoculars it appeared to be very bright with a hint of a metallic, silver-type shade to it.  After about five minutes, we lost behind the clouds;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

Bright light in vici;1999-03-04 18:55:00;20 min.;a non moving light over Sea Tac Airport that was brighter then Bright light over vicinity of Sea Tac Airport  S.W. Bright light in vicinity of Sea Tac Airport S.W. area. Thought it was plane but stayed stationary  ten minutes zoomed out of sight and then returned. A glowing sphere that at first it's shape was like wide slice of bread,and then went to sphere shape and changed from pale orange to green halo to light blue center with pulsing circles within itself. Thursday evening  looking southwest towards airport watching the lights from the planes coming in from the Des Moines area to	land going north. Noticed one set of lights that at a distance might look one bright light and as it gets nearer it turns into a pair of lights. This bright light didn't move. Called for my 27 old son to come and look at this. We got our video camera to scan in on it and look to see what it was. It moved east like it was coming towards us as it was monving I could see the shape like a wide slice of bread or a fat car without wheels. It slowed or stopped and began glowing , but it looked liked was getting bigger like if blowing up a baloon into a sphere and inside this ball there were multiple rings of circles that were pulsing .Before it came to stop it looked red,then orange to real pale orange and then expandedto this big glowing grey light blue ball with a  sherbert green halo . Again inside like I said before it was pulsing within itself with rows of circles. My son and I watched it for fifteen minutes .At one point you could see it moving away until it got out of sight. But at a great rate of speed.Then it returned back  to the place  where it originally was , then again  it left our view after a few minutes . The sky is clear because we can see the stars. This was no star.  I've had one other sighting back in 64 over  Enumclaw with five glowing discs.PLaying up in the sky dodging and dipping chasing one another. there size that about of a beer cap .watched them for forty five minutes, got bored following them in the early morn it was  four o'clock a.m.      And one thing , our video camera didn't have a tape in it  like  i thought it was supose to have. Now no record to prove it. I was very upset.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Bright object speeds from cloud over Renton at very rapid speed and disappears above Boeing.;2002-11-20 00:18:00;3 seconds;Bright object speeds from cloud over Renton at very rapid speed and disappears above Boeing. I live on a hill overlooking downtown Renton, Boeing, Lk. Wash.  Shortly after midnight, I was turning off the lights in my living room when a bright light caught the corner of my eye as a cloud illuminated, in which a round bright object bolted out from it (South to North).  It sped at a VERY fast speed over Boeing where it then shot upward and disappeared into either another cloud or it just vanished into thin air.  It could not have been an aircraft as it was completely silent and it was moving too fast.  It was moving too fast to be anything else. 1-1/2 years ago, I experienced another incident that I reported to the National UFO Reporting Center via phone, but no one called me back.  I was living in Kirkland at that time and was awoken by a beam of light in my window and a loud swish-swish-swish noise.  The VCR was turning on-and-off by itself.  I woke up my boyfriend who was as startled as I.  The next thing we remember is waking up in the morning. The clocks were off by 3 hours.  I called Puget Sound Energy, but no outages had been reported that night. Then I noticed that there was a small purple crescent-shape on my right shoulder.  It looked like a tattoo and it eventually faded after about a month.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

Looking east a large moon sized green ball shot down at a 75 degree angle at what seemed like 3 or 4oo miles per hour.No sound or explosion occured it just vanished. A light trail followed it but dissapated almost immedeatelly. ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports of this apparently dramatic event, although we spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he sounded quite sincere, objective, and credible to us.
