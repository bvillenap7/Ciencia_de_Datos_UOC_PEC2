About 400 ft. high, moving very slow approx. 15mph.It made no sound, no lights, held steady speed over our house.  I asked my daughter if she saw it too, and she said yes, dad what is that.  Ship had a lot of detail similar to movie starships, but all in white lines only. Would wild guess size, at 1000 to 1500 ft. long, and around 600 ft. wide.  It took about 1 min. to go over our house and was gone.  I now have no doubts regarding existence of UFO s and felt a need to tell someone.

Seems to be 4 flashing blue/white lights with an occasional dimmer red light in somewhat the center.   Has not seemed to have moved in the past couple of nights. I believe last night at about the same time a smaller light moved a few degrees west. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of the star, Sirius, but cannot be certain.
