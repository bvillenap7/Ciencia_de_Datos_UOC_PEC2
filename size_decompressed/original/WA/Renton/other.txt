Looked like a streetlight, hovering like a helicopter in Fairwood, Renton;2003-07-25 13:00:00;20 mins.;Looked like a streetlight, hovering like a helicopter in Fairwood, Renton My sighting was this summer.  My husband was working nightshift.  I was alone.  Mars was close so I turned out the lights and pulled my shades open.  At first I thought I saw a plane.  I live in the cascades area of Renton and this plane, oddly was hovering over the Fairwood area of Renton for about twenty minutes.  I realized this was way too big and too low to be a plane, or helicopter.  It looked how a streetlight would but about 5,000 times bigger.  Streetlights aren't that high.  Planes aren't this low.  Helicopters hover, it was too big to be a helicopter.  So, I watched it for twenty minutes.  My jaw was open, mezmerized.  Realized I had no clue what was gong on.  I put the covers over my head.  I was really scared all of a sudden.  I called my husband.  The phone conversation lasted five minutes.  I got off the phone, peeked my head out of the covers and it was totally gone. I also noted it was shimmering like streetlights can shimmer.  This U.F.O. looked like it was over the big road Petrovitsky, in Renton. This object would have been in the direction of Maple Valley.  I have never seen anything so big in the sky and hovering at the same time.  I also feel someone else must have seen it.  This Thing was not hiding.
