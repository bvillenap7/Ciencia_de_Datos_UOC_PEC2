Hovering, circular UFO over Lake Washington, Renton WA, Early January 2005;2005-01-05 06:15:00;2 minutes;Hovering, circular UFO over Lake Washington, Renton WA, Early January 2005 I am reporting this sighting on behalf of my wife and a friend who both apparently saw the same craft at the same time without knowing it at the time. Neither are sure of the exact date but it appears to be sometime during the first week of January 2005.  Both were travelling on I-405 North (in separate cars) at approximately 6am in the morning. Around the 30th Street Exit (Kennydale) they saw a craft of some sort that seemed to be hovering over Lake Washington. My wife said that it seemed circular, and the lights were like nothing she had ever seen on an airplane. She had the very real feeling that she could possibly be seeing a UFO.  It was still dark so no details of the craft could be determined other than the odd lights. Just tonight (1/27) my friend called and he wanted to tell me about something he saw in the sky. It turned out it was the same approximate time and place as my wife's sighting. Neither of them had known the other had seen something, let alone at the same time.  My friend said that it was definitely circular and hovering. The lights were around the whole craft and Revolving. He knows what airplanes and helicopters look like, and this he said, was nothing like those. The revolving lights in a circular pattern was what really got - and kept - his attention. He said he kept his eye on it to the point that he almost hit the car in front of him. Approximate time of sighting lasted 2-3 minutes until he could no longer see it in his rear-view mirror.  I'm interested to know if there are any other witnesses who saw this craft, or similar craft in this location and time-frame. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Helicopter/airplane follows a fireball?;2010-12-06 21:01:00;A few minutes;Helicopter/airplane follows a fireball? I was driving home from work on Talbot Road, my location was approximately one mile north of Valley Medical Center. I was on speaker phone having my nightly conversation with my mom. I noticed coming from east to west something interesting... It was not raining, the sky was over-cast. I saw what looked like a normal (I assume) helicopter/airplane lights red,green and white and about 50ft from the helicopter/airplane a red ball of light. Mind me -my mother was on the phone with me the whole time. What caught my attention was how insinc they were flying together, it seemed that the helicopter was about 50ft behind this red ball of light the whole time. I kept my eyes on the second craft hoping that it would show some sort of running lights you would normally see when aircraft are in the sky, the red ball of light kept flickering and pulsating as it lead the helicopter/airplane from east to north-west. I pulled over into an old sub-division (I was scared that I would run into a car)where I had a view to watch this. The objects were about 200ft give or take? in the sky, they moved from Benson Hill-Talbot Road area across the Valley towards Southcenter Mall and what looked like the Burien area. It struck me as odd. I think we (humans) need to pay attention to the sky more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

2 lights at 5 minute intervals flying across the sky, then disapear in the middle of the sky.;2012-07-04 22:15:00;10 minutes;2 lights at 5 minute intervals flying across the sky,then disapear in the middle of the sky. We were watching the fireworks when I noticed a orange cirlcular shape fly across the horizon.  I thought it was a firework but it kept flying along the horizon for about 1 minute and then it disappeared.    I grabbed my wife when I saw the same shape and color came back but on a different path from the first.  It was in the sky for about another minute before disappearing.   The night was very clear, I could see stars clearly and there was not enough smoke to have visual interuption.  It was not traveling at a hight rate of speed, but the light was very visible and then it disappeared.  It did not disappear over the horizon, but in the middle of the sky;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
