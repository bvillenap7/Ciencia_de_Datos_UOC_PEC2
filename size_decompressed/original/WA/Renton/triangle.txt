I was being driven to the Renton Public Library by my mom, (I'm in fifth grade) when i passed the greenwood cemetery, and the Renton Technical College, as we approached the gas station, I saw a plane with crazy flashing lights. Then, It suddenly did a sharp turn and followed the road that we were heading on. Then, as we were passing Mt. Olivet cemetery, it rose up to what looked like a star in 1-3 seconds. I didn't tell my mom at the moment because she doesn't believe. I only told my best UFO investigator partner buddy.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Triangular object with three red steady lights flying over Renton.;2009-09-19 19:00:00;3 minutes;Triangular object with three red steady lights flying over Renton. I spotted this object while walking my dog.  I took out my phone and shot some video of it.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBUg5-rjQt8 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW-hiO9Yqqs   It was hard to focus on it.  Also there was a low pitched hum which you could feel more than hear which the camera did not pick up along with the high pitched whine you can hear on the video. I think this may be the same object in your report http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72506.html   Though I am much further south than Everett.  I'm near Renton.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
