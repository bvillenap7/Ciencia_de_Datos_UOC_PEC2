saw object approx 100-200 yrds in length hover above Valley Medical Center. Object was orange/red glow.;1999-08-21 02:00:00;5-8 minutes;saw object approx 100-200 yrds in length hover above Valley Medical Center. Object was orange/red glow. At approx. 2 am 8/20/99 I was on my deck with view of Renton Valley.  Above Valley Medical Center I saw an oragnge/red object (approx. 100-200 yrds in length).  My distance from object approx. 1/2 mile.  It hovered in that position for approx. 1-2 minutes.  Object then began moving to SW accross the Renton/Kent Valley, above Demoines hill.  Object appeared to maintain altitude.  The object appeared to nearly crest the horizon from my vantage when it began approaching Renton again.  It continued back towards me across the valley in the same path it had taken on its departure.  It continued until it was somewhere above the vacinity of the Valley Medical Center.  The object hovered for approx 1-2 minutes again. The object began moving and departed towards the SW again, but this time disappeared over the horizon.  It did not reappear.  I took several pictures of the item, however the negatives came back without exposure.  The object did not appear to have any exterior lighting and did not make any sound.  It appeared to just glow.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Large cigar shaped object reflecting the sun in the morning sky.  Very slow moving if at all.;2002-10-16 07:30:00;3 minutes;Large cigar shaped object reflecting the sun in the morning sky.  Very slow moving if at all. We saw a large cigar shaped object to the north hovering on the horizon.  It was reflecting the sun, so it looked orange.   It seemed to maybe change pitch while we were watching, but as our vantage point changed, it could have only appeared so.   It may have moved slowly or it may have just changed position with respect to the horizon because of orbit or the earth's rotation.   Was this the space station?   Whatever it was was big.   No way was it a planet, star or airplane.   I don't know what the space station looks like or if it would have been in the morning sky, but I watched it for a while, so I know that whatever it was, it was really there. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the first possibility to be ruled out would be a contrail in the eastern sky.  PD));47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
