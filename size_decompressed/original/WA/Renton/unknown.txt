Shap given as unknown, because of the distant and movement of binoculars they could have been either oval, or disk shaped. Both my brother and I are private pilots. In our 40's. While watching aircraft superpolluting the skys. (and they make us take our cars in for a emissions test) Through binoculars, my brother became very excited he said I see something else up there. I ran to get some binoculars too. The one he saw was stationary above the area where the contrails were being made. ie amost directly above our house. Then after a couple of minutes is started to move fairly fast to the east. Untill out of sight. He then spotted another which I did see. Definately a metallic look to it. It was moving to the east went out of sight behind some trees. The third one (all these in the same general area above our house) moved to the east but then slowed down and seemed to make some aerobatic manuvers like turns to the left and some small circles and then proceeded to the east. All these were traveling much faster than the upper atmosphere winds could carry them.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

My wife & I saw 100+ UFO's last night!;2003-10-23 23:00:00;1 hour;My wife & I saw 100+ UFO's last night! Last night my wife and I saw over 100 UFO flying overhead at over 40,000' They were flying in a formation the same as the little dipper and other formations. There were 2 clouds only coving 25% of the sky and it was Super Clear out. We did see 2 Jet planes after they left the SEA-TAC Airport, so we could use them as a comparison. We figure the speed to be 3,000-to-5,000 MPH. They were ALL Traveling SWW over Burien, Federal Way, Fife, Tacoma. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot certify that this is a serious-minded report, but incredibly, it appears to us to have been submitted by a person who probably would be regarded to be a credible source.  We will write the source for clarification.  PD));47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
LIGHT OVER SEA-TAC WITH PERTICULAR SHAPE AND PATTERN CAUGHT ON TAPE;2007-02-11 22:00:00;15 min;LIGHT OVER SEA-TAC WITH PERTICULAR SHAPE AND PATTERN CAUGHT ON TAPE Well, to put it as plain as possible, I was standing on my front porch of my appartment with my next door neigbors, which I and them both have moved from that location.  Long story short, while we where smoking, I caught a bright light appear to our east just about above Sea-tac Airport.  It was about 15 degrees up in the sky, and it was brighter than any lights coming from the aircraft flying below it and infront of it.  It moved very slowely in the north direction at a very slow pace.  It moved about 10 to 15 degrees in 30 min moving north. Now as it was moving north it was what seem to be changing alttitudes.  It was Very bright, again much brighter than the large craft coming from the airport not far from where it was seen.  It had no flashing lights.  I have lived next to airports for most of my life, not including when I was a young child lived next to Miramar naval station in San-Diego CA for quite some time, and this thing I saw in my oppinion was not moving or acting like a normal aircraft.  I got a 10 to 15 min video of this light.  When the camera focused in on the light, it was flat on top and bottom, Rounded on both sides, and had a very perticular pattern to it. A pattern I cant even describe.  The two people that where there with me were flabergasted as well was I. It took me about a min to realize what was going on and then went and grabed my camera to get 10-15 min of video. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

UFO sighting Feb 15, 2010 over Lake Washington North of Boeing in Renton;2010-02-15 05:30:00;15+ Min;UFO sighting Feb 15, 2010, over Lake Washington North of Boeing in Renton There was a sighting of at least 2 seperate large UFO's this morning Feb 15, 2010 just north of  Boeing's Renton Plant over Lake Washington.  Sighting was just before the fog rolled in between 5am and 5:45am.  Sighting lasted for several minutes to 15 minutes.   Red blinking hovering lights that moved south at a very slow pace, no sound and less than 500ft above the lake.  During the sighting the red lights changed blinking sequence.  Viewed by at least 4 people.  At least one craft was said to have portholes of a white light along the sides or edge.  Both craft where large with one of them being extreamly large, the smaller was larger than a football field.  There may also be video of this event, but will have to review and determine if this video shows the crafts before releasing. ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to contact the witness, but have not heard back, yet.  PD));47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
Slow moving silent bright white light  ((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station overflight.  PD));2010-07-07 22:30:00;60 seconds;Slow moving silent bright white light My husband and I were enjoying looking at the stars and noticed a single bright light moving from the NE to the SW over the Renton WA area.   We had just seen 2 planes leaving Sea Tac with their blinking lights, this object had a steady white light that did not blink.  It moved slowly in a straight line. Did not change speed or direction.   As it moved past us and to the SW we expected to hear the engine noise but heard nothing.   Silent. It continued to the SW and the light dimmed until we could no longer see it.  Possibly a low orbiting satellite?  The light seemed way too bright to be from orbit. it seemed lower like the same elevation the planes were on. ((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station overflight.

Bright red lit aircraft turns green.;2015-09-11 21:20:00;~2 minutes;Bright red lit aircraft turns green. Tonight, I witnessed object flying at low speed with multiple extremely luminous red lights from North to south.  It raised up then down in a low amplitude arc then stopped abruptly.  It hovered for approximately 30 seconds, then all the lights turned green.   Approximately 30 seconds after that a small (air craft looking) light green strobe started.  The craft then raised and lowered a short distance before returning to its original position. The craft then lowered below my sight line.  No sound.   I live in an area with a lot of air traffic, and this was unlike anything seen before.  It may be possible that it was a drone, however from the size, distance, and speed, I find it unlikely.;47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017

No sound was heard, no flashing lights, just white/red beams.   They appeared to be sub-sonic.   As approaching closer they were also climbing in altitude until each set of 2 disappeared into the clouds.   Some video was taken via a tablet, though clarity isnâ€™t the best.   Shape of objects was not clearly seen, looking like round objects in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.4804239766082;-122.154122807017
