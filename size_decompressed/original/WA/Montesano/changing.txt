UFO Filmed Over Washington State.;2004-06-18 17:00:00;About Two Minutes;UFO Filmed Over Washington State. Video was taken on June 18th 2004. The object (s?) in the video were headed in a South, Southwestern direction.  --The video's exact time was at 5:04 pm and is 26 seconds long.  I live in the Grays Harbor area, about 40 minutes away from Ocean Shores, Washington. While sitting outside on a very sunny, beautiful day - I guess you can say I looked up at the right time.  I noticed the object (s?) going across the sky and it just seemed almost unreal. For a moment thought I was just seeing things. I soon realized that there really was an object flying across the sky and I ran inside to grab my Digital Camera (Fuji s5000). I actually had enough time to run inside, about 5 seconds time, and pick up my camera from my computer desk. I ran outside to film this and what you see is what you get.  I can't explain it, I don't know what it was. I can call it an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO), being I don't know what it is. What I can say is that when I saw it, it seemed odd looking to me, almost cigar shaped and white. After reviewing it on video, I now realize that I may have actually been looking at two white colored objects, not one. ((URL deleted)) Contact me via email please.

We do not know what the object is, and we have not seen the original tape, but it might be difficult to identify the object, even with extensive analysis of the footage.
