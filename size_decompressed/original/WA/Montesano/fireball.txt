I was traveling east on hwy 107 about 2 miles out side Montesano. looking to the north northwest I could see a bright flash that caught my eye. I saw a streaking fire ball about 10 degrees above the horizon. It was much brighter and its duration was longer than any thing I have ever seen before. I first saw the streak and was able to slow my car from about 45 mph to 10 or 15 mph before it was completly gone. I am a machinery designer with a background that included military service as a lookout aboard a Coast Guard ship.;47.0368914285714;-123.542442857143
