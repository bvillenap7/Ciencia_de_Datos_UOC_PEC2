Light anomaly over Montesano, WA, Grays Harbor County.;2018-10-10 21:00:00;20+ minutes;Light Anomaly over Montesano, WA, Grays Harbor County. I was at Friend's Landing in Montesano.  Was sitting in my vehicle, when my Fiancee and I noticed a yellowish orange light in the sky.  It seemed to be moving around, flying in circles and visibly turning itself, as it would get brighter when facing our direction. I called a family member who lives in Aberdeen to go outside and check it out, they could also see the anomaly in the sky.  A plane was flying and the UFO noticed it, slowly flew closer for a short distance before taking off and making a large gap between itself and the plane. After the plane had past it continued to fly randomly side to side and in circles, my fiancee decided to flick our headlights on and off.  The anomaly turned towards us and slowly flew our direction, so my partner flicked the headlights on a couple more times and it came closer but stopped before we could make any shape of the craft out.  The craft continued flying around randomly, but at this point we had to head home.  The light was still visible from my house. My Fiancee and I like to go outside a lot, and this anomaly has been seen by us multiple times.  It seems to be watching this area, for reasons unknown.  It generally looks like a bright yellow-orange star.  Seen year round, noticed it last summer for the first time.;47.0368914285714;-123.542442857143
Seven star-like objects transited the sky from west to east towards Mt. Rainier.;2020-08-15 03:35:00;2 minutes;Seven star-like objects transited the sky from west to east towards Mt. Rainier. Date: 08/15/2020 03:35AM, Montesano, Washington Region  Seven star-like objects transited the sky from west to east.  The objects were brighter than the brightest star yet not as bright as the planet Venus in the night sky.  The light emanating from the craft was whitish and did not flicker.  Altitude uncertain but appeared to be greater than 1 mile high.  The objects maintained a single file line but would change distance apart so not always equidistant one from the other.  Speed was faster than passenger jet 1.5x to 2x.  Lights went off sequentially as each light neared a certain point in the sky above Mt. Rainier.  Sky was clear and light pollution minimal at time of sighting.  Duration of sighting was approximately 1-2 minutes.;47.0368914285714;-123.542442857143
