As I was driving home, I noticed a blue, green, and red dot flashing in the sky.  It looked strange.  I figured it was a plane until it stopped moving.   When I got home, my dad, my sister, and me went to our porch.  When we looked at it, we noticed there was an odd shape witb lights moving.   The craft was moving in a figure 8 type movement, occasionally drifting off a little bit.   When video taping it, it was clear it was an object, but didn't know what.  My camera also noticed movement under it and beside it, we we couldn't see it.  Some flashes of light occured in the general area.   We were told that recent spottings had ufo's being chased by jets, so I'm wondering if that's what my camera caught.   The sighting seemed to be by Tonasket/Okanogan area.   I am very intrigued to found out what it is.;48.6679;-118.7065
