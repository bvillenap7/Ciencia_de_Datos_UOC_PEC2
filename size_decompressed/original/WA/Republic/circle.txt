Small white flashing lights all over sky and bigger round non flashing object traveling low above womans car seen on sherman pass WA.;2011-11-23 23:00:00;10 min;Small white flashing lights all over sky and bigger round non flashing object traveling low above womans car seen on Sherman Pass, WA. I was traveling from Colville, Washington, to Republic on Sherman pass.  I came over the top of the pass and noticed a flashing white light.  I thought that it was an airplane at first.   As I came down the mountian further there is quite a big area where you can see very far, and all around.  I was looking an noticed that there was not just one white light but many lights flashing randomly in the sky around a large object that had many colored lights.  The bigger object was not flashing and moving verry slow and low.  I realized that it was not an airplane as it got closer.   I was driving in my car the whole time I was watching.  The closer it came to me i could tell that it was round. it had red yellow, blue, etc., lights in a circle pattern seeming to be the bottom.  It also had a few lights shining out the sides.  It flew verry slow and seemed to be traveling twords my car.  It came very close crossing right above my car.   It was big as far as i could tell, as it was verry low and traveling slow.  I think it may have been changing colors and the pattern on the bottom was changing a little i cant be sure.  I was very scared and after i had passed the area I didnt really look back.   I was scared it was following me because it had flew so close and right towards and then above my car.  I didn't want to believe what I had seen.
