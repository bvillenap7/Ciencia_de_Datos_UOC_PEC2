There were 3 of us gazing at the stars and numerous satelites. Then all of a sudden we were watching this one satelite and it just dropped at an enormous speed. It came to a complete stop, which it went from just a moving light dot in the sky to a large light that flashed,(which seem to be directly at us.) Then with no noise at all it went straight back up to it's original height and continued across the sky and then went so high we couldn't see it any longer. No noise. At first we all thought it was a shooting star, but the light didn't get bright until it stopped and the light was not like any other light I had seen. It was something I had never seen before and being an outdoor kinda person I was completely bewildered as to what it actually was. How anything man-made could move as such a tremdous speed. No craft was seen, just the light.....It seemed like the light had a cover and they opened to expose the flash of light.;48.6679;-118.7065
