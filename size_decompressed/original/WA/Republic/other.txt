I saw a flat metal shiny object flying across from Lake Culew opposite Tiffany's Resort along the hillside. It was mid-day and I happened to look up and saw an object tracking along the hills.  The object was going approximately 200 miles an hour.  It was too close to the hills to be a regular airplane.  I watched it fly along the hillside for approximately 20 seconds and then it went behind some trees and I lost it.  It seemed like it tracked around the end of the hillside since it didn't come out from behind the trees.  The object was flat and no longer than 20 feet.  The height was maybe 8 feet at most. The distance from myself was about 1.5 miles away.  There was no sound. I immediately thought it was a UFO, but after considering the terrain and circumstances I wondered if it was a Military Drone. I am a 44 year old female of sound body and mind and was not under the influence of any substances when I saw this object.;48.6679;-118.7065
