This was unusual as we have no street or bright lights in the vicinity. This light was almost shining on my face. My cat was looking out the window as I got up and looked out the door. I saw approximately 3 unidentified flying objects hovering and darting right and left from each other, almost playing tag in a Northeast direction. These craft were at a distance like a low airplane. They were diamond/cyclinder shaped with bright, small lights bouncing off and changing color. I hid behind the wall and when next I looked they were gone...
