I was on the edge of Freeland in a parking lot and happened to look up to notice a strange wide bright streak of light high up in the twilight of the sky. Too wide and bright to be a jet vapor trail, plus as it traveled, nothing was left behind. No object was visible in front of the streak. I told my friend with me and we proceeded to follow it, by truck, as it started to disappear from our point of view. N We only followed it for a short time, as it headed away from us toward north toward Oak Harbor. Never saw anything like this before. First UFO experience.;48.0354;-122.5686
