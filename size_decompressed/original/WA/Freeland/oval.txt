Three orange fire-ball lights seen streaming across the overhead sky.;2014-06-21 22:00:00;~3 minutes;Three orange fire-ball lights seen streaming across the overhead sky. On 6/21/14, 4 adults were watching the western horizon to observe an ISS flyby.. (ISS is the International Space Station.) It was visible in our area (Whidbey Island) at 9:49pm for 4 minutes.  It became visible in the WSW at 11 degrees above the horizon and departed at 11 degrees S.  We could see it fly over the Olympics. We were on the west side of Whidbey Island, on a bluff overlooking the water on the south end of the island.  It is about 30 miles from the Naval Air Station. Three objects appeared, consecutively, about a minute or so after we watched the ISS, but they were overhead.   As soon as one disappeared in the southern tree line, another appeared from the north.  The objects were oval shaped.   From below, we didn't see them as 3 dimensional.  They were orange, reddish, almost flame colored with no contrail or flame trail.  Seemed to be like a low flying aircraft.   We fully expected the first one, when noticed, to be a search helicopter with spotlight.  However, it was shortly followed by a second and then a third object.   All three appeared to have the same overhead trajectory and followed each other at ~30 sec intervals.  Too close to have been the same object circling.   Their flight pattern was straight, with no change in speed or direction.   The eerie part was their silence.  There was no sound detected from any of the objects, which seemed strange, since the slightest noise gets amplified over/around water. The observers were 2 adult males and 2 adult females, ages 66-70.  All with college degrees.  Unfortunately, no photos were taken.;48.0354;-122.5686
