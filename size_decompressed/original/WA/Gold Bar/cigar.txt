It was a cigar-shaped thing. It was moving at a high rate of speed through the mountains. It glowed on one end, the forward end. At fist, we thought it was a meteor. But we were able to see it for some length of time. As it crossed from south to north over the valley.;47.8302;-121.6372
Three bright lights observed hovering over Skykomish River in Gold Bar, WA;2003-04-08 21:50:00;10 seconds;Three bright lights observed hovering over Skykomish River in Gold Bar, WA At 9:50 p.m. I was sitting on the couch by the large picture window and saw 3 lights at tree top level traveling up the river in front of the house.  They were about 1000 feet down river from me.  I jumped up and went to the sliding glass doors and opened them. As the craft traveled the 1,000 feet from where I first spotted it to in front of the house, it descended from tree top level to about 50 feet above the river. When it got right in front of me, the lights disappeared.   There was no sound and I couldn't tell if the craft went under water or just turned the lights off and flew off.   The length of the craft was about 80 feet, with one light at the front, one in the middle and one at the end.  It was a long, tube or cigar shaped craft.  It was too dark to tell if there were any wings or other portions protruding from it.  A companion heard a helicopter flying overhead about an hour later, which is unusual, since we are in a very remote area.  This is my first UFO sighting and I am a middle aged professional that is not easliy taken by any type of UFO phenomena.;47.8302;-121.6372
