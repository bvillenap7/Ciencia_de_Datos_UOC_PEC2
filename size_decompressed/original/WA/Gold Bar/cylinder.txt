Obverved floating cylinder on sunny afternoon.;2016-06-06 14:15:00;20 minutes;Obverved floating cylinder on sunny afternoon. I was driving my teens back from school via Route 2 East on a sunny, nearly cloudless afternoon from Monroe to Gold Bar.  As we neared Startup, my son pointed out the window and asked, What's that up there?  We all three observed a huge floating cylinder above the foothills, between Gold Bar and possibly Index.   It was hard to tell exactly what part of the countryside it was floating over, it was so high up.  It was very, very high up, so it must have been enormous.  It was just hanging there, not moving at all.   We watched it all the way home and when we got out of the car, we continued to watch it for about five more minutes as it slowly moved east, farther into the mountains.  It made no sound at all.  It was upright, but tilted.   I have no idea why none of us thought to take a picture with my cell phone, but we didn't.  We were too busy goggling at it.;47.8302;-121.6372
One black floating cylinder shaped object moved in air floating ...turned like it was being driven from horizontal to vertical.;2016-06-06 14:20:00;30 minutes+;A (just one) black floating cylinder shaped object moved in air floating ...turned like it was being driven from horizontal to vertical then back to vertical very smoothly.  I lost sight becasue I was driving.  Very strange!   Sunny 86 degrees day, a few scattered clouds, but very visible.   When it turned i saw a shiny part on top of cylinder shaped object.;47.8302;-121.6372
