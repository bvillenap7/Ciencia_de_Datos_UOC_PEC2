I also seen a spotlight type beam come from the center of the sphere that was seemingly searching the area.  later the object sank behind the trees, and I could see the object shining through the trees.  The object at certain times would wink out and reappear at another location.  The object also, would multiply & reduce back into one object.  After watching this light show for about 20-30 minutes we decided to vacate the area for fear of our safty.;47.8302;-121.6372
