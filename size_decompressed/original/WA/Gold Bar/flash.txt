Blue flash lights up sky in Gold Bar;2004-01-22 00:15:00;1 second;Blue flash lights up sky in Gold Bar At 12:15 a.m. this morning I was in my bedroom watching TV, when I looked out my window and saw the entire sky light up with a blue flash. My house is in the mountains on the Skykomish River and it faces Mt. Wallace and Rocky Ridge. (It faces the North East)and that was the direction I was looking at the time. It was not a streak like lightening, but the entire sky lit up and the blue light went all the way down to the river and ground.  It was just like daylight for a second--except it was blue.  There was no sound made.     I am a 52 year old man, don't drink and don't really believe in UFOs, but don't know what it was that I saw.;47.8302;-121.6372
