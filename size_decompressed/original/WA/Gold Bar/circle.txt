((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  We wonder whether the source of the report intended to indicate a date in 1993.

pulsating light crosses sky;2004-06-27 23:15:00;1 minute;pulsating light crosses sky I was out stargazing, as usual and saw a very strange light crossing the night sky.  It was not a satellite nor a plane.  It was moving in a southwestern pattern.  It was also pulsating.  It would get bright, then very dim as if to almost disappear.  I thought maybe it was a satellite, but it was different.  As I continued to watch, I did in fact see a satellite cross, and this thing was definetly bigger and brighter and did not move in a very straight pattern like the satellite did.  I then began thinking it must be a plane, but it was way too high.  I then saw a plane float by and I realized it definetly was not a plane either.  The planes have the distinctive blue and red lights that alternate, and the moving thing did not.  It was also way higher than any plane can go.  I followed it until I could not see it any longer (approximately a minute or so).;47.8302;-121.6372

A few minutes later 3 more balls of light appeared to go after it.  Scared me so bad .;47.8302;-121.6372
