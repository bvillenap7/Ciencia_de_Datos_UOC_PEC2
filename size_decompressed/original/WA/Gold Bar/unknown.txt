The largest and brightest light I have ever seen in the sky with the exception of the sun (brighter than the moon but not as large).;2008-05-30 23:00:00;Approx 5 min;The largest and brightest light I have ever seen in the sky with the exception of the sun (brighter than the moon but not as large). Was leaving the house to enter a camper parked in the driveway.  The night is warm and the sky clear.  I always look to the northern sky for the northern lights.  I have never seen them but my wife did a few years ago.  Anyway, I noticed an extremely bright (white light) object moving from west to east.  At first I thought it was a plane with the landing lights on, but realized the lights were far too bright and that it was traveling the wrong direction.  Also thought it was moving too fast to be a commercial airliner.  I then suspected the space station due to the size (maybe 15 to 20 times bigger than the largest star in it's traverse).  I looked away for just a second and when I turned back it was gone!  I could not believe that it had disappeared so quickly as it was not near the horizon or mountains the last time I saw it. I came inside, got on the computer and checked the space station and satellite orbits.  According to the Govt.  Nothing passed even close to that area of the sky.;47.8302;-121.6372
