Blueish light seen in mountains.;2000-03-11 21:45:00;00:01;Blueish light seen in mountains. My friend, ((name deleted)), started mentioning an unusual light at one end of the lake we were at.  When he mentioned that it didn't look terrestial and that he didn't think there were any roads in that direction, I finally turned to look.  I saw a light behind some trees about 100 yards away.  The light suddenly travelled up the hill at an incredibly fast speed and the light was blueish.  This was enough to convince me it wasn't the kind of light normally emitted by a flashlight.  I immediately started the truck and proceeded along the road to leave the area while we watched to see if it was going to follow us.  We both prayed for the next 10 minutes for fear of what the light emitting object might have been.;47.8302;-121.6372
Super Bright Light over Gold Bar;2006-08-18 21:30:00;45 seconds;Super Bright Light over Gold Bar Between 9:30 p.m. and 9:40 p.m. my husband and I and a neighbor were sitting on our deck visiting and looking at the stars.  A very bright light fell slowly from the sky to the east.  It stopped when it got about 4,000 ft. high and moved towards us (N.W.) for 10 or 15 seconds and then the light disappeared. The light was very, very bright and about 4 times as big as the light on an airliner. (We are in a flight path, for flights coming from the east over the Cascades, so we know what they look like.) It did not make any sound we could hear. At first we thought maybe it was a  meteor falling, but then it stopped falling and changed direction.;47.8302;-121.6372
