Strange V formation in morning sky over the Skykomish Valley.;2000-09-12 07:50:00;10min;Strange V formation in morning sky over the Skykomish Valley. Heading east on highway 2, I observed a white or silver formation in the southeast, several degrees above the horizon. It looked at first glance as a comet with duel tails, a sort of V shape. Looking just like a V with the point on the bottom. It did not appear to be moving, but as I continued driving east it dissapeared below the horizon and out of my view as I got closer to it. I then called my neighbor who I thought may have a better unobstructed view from his home, but he was unable to see it. I then drove to his home a mere 2 minutes after the sighting and aquired a pair of binoculers and he and I went back out on the highway to the location at which I first observed it, but it was no longer visible. This was the most unusual and unexplained thing I have ever seen.;47.8302;-121.6372
