It was an amazing display of a light show that kept repeating the pattern of lights... it was going south like following our driveway to the end..then in seconds it was going west like the shape of an L.. directly down our street..We live in the woods trees on both side..It seemed like it was almost following our street..I ran down the road too keep it in sight...and i observed That this object was Huge!! I saw the side view and it seemed to be the shape of what looked like a top hat with a circular base....I would say it was at least 200ft in diameter ...When I first saw this i'd say it was at least 1,ooo ft up in the sky.. It was something i'd never seen before....I made a drawing of this and will be submitting it soon..It was truling amazingâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and found him to be both credible,  and cogent in his description of what he and his wife had seen on the evening of their sighting.

Column of light -with Amber & Yellow beams within it(like a information or energy gathering satilite device);2005-08-01 03:30:00;20 minutes;Column of light -with Amber & Yellow beams within it(like a information or energy gathering satilite device) I was walking down a trail at 3am in the morning back in 2005, when I looked back down the trail and thought I saw someone with a head lamp on coming toward me but it was a 1/4 of a mile back.  I stopped and adjusted my backpack and looked again at it and it seemed like 2 or 3 led lights that were together (but orangish colored) close together and I couldn't tell what it was-looked like it was staying in one place which was weird. So I started moving toward it and walked down the trail after it.  It stayed there slightly off the trail.  As I got closer I couldn't see it because it was hidden behind the trees that were along the trail. When I got closer to the left hand side of the trail I put my back pack down on the side of the trail and walked up and over the side of the trail and though the woods -when I got to the top of the hill on the side of the trail and was in the woods I could see in this big field (for cows -but they have no cows) this column of light. The column of light was an amber and light yellow.  Similar to a column (about 20-25 ft tall and about 1 1/2ft wide) Within the column were vertical 2-3 beams that were amber and yellow in color.  The whole column slowly rotated from the left to the right, in place and smaller beams the same (2-3) would move from the center of it like it was scanning the grass bellow it from the column out around it about 3-4 feet out -from the center about ten feet up.  It hovered above the ground by a few inches, it slowly moved within a small area along the field less than six to ten feet that I saw it move.  I don't recall it making any sounds. There was no metal or glass, only beams of light. An amber & yellow column of lights (like a information or energy gathering satellite device) I don't know, that's my best guess. I thought it was gathering information or energy from the area below it-I was so frightened that I only could watch it for a few minutes once I found it doing that.  I wanted to run and was scared it would follow me.  I calmly and briskly walked away from it and kept looking back.  I don't know how it got there or what ever happened after I left. I always look toward that side of the trail even to this day.  I know it wasn't anything supernatural.  It was a far more intelligent being than us that was in controlling it.  I just thought someone should know what I saw. If there was a way in this medium I would for you.  It would take less words. When I noticed this site I thought it important to explain what I saw to a credible place and have it documented.  Unfortunately I had no cell phone back then with a camera with me.  I will submit a sketch -but it's not even close to how cool it really looked. Thank you for this medium (for explaining what I saw).

I have video footage of UFO activity.;2009-07-05 11:00:00;seconds;I have video footage of UFO activity. Hello, I just discovered that I have footage of UFO activity occurring approximately 11 a.m. July 5, 2009 over the skies of Western Washington .  I was shooting  an outdoor sequence for an online video contest entry.  The footage was a shot of my hand picking up a brick, the camera was to follow the brick as I raised it up.  The shots were successful and I put the footage away for a while intending to work on it later. I have now finally gotten around to it.   It was Friday, July 18 when I finally started editing the footage together.  I was moving through it frame by frame, intending to do some motion tracking for the project.  That is when I noticed a streak cross the frame.  The object appeared distant and slightly obscured by a light cloud cover.  It moved across the screen in a slight upwards diagonal motion the entire sequence lasts only six frames.  However, upon reviewing the rest of my footage I found that there are more indistinct dark spots that cannot be explained, moving in various directions, they seem to be falling from the sky, then stopping, then moving sideways and in one case following each other .  Unfortunately, because the focus of my shots was on my activities all images are not in focus enough to tell what these objects were, but I cannot recognize any of them as being conventional aircraft. I do not know who to tell about this, who I should show this footage to.  Does anyone have any ideas, suggestions, information as to experts that can verify this footage as being real?  Truthfully I'm very much surprised by the whole incident.  Any response, information would be deeply appreciated.  Thank you.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Small slow flying disc shape.;2015-05-19 21:05:00;10 minutes;Small slow flying disc shape. May 19th, 	my wife and I just saw an unidentified object moving slowly from West to East over Bellingham, WA.  It was round in shape and had lights around it.   We watched it for about 10 minutes as it flew slowly and then ascended at a faster pace and disappeared.   We have never seen anything like this before and are hoping that others in the area have seen it too, as it was fairly low and slow moving.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Fireball with tail suddenly hits lower altitude, flame gone, half-circle shape with antennae.;2015-06-30 14:00:00;2-5 seconds;Fireball with tail suddenly hits lower altitude, flame gone, half-circle shape with antennae. Happened to look up at this object while walking near downtown Bellingham.  Began as a fireball with a pollywog(baby frog) shape (I remember thinking), complete with a tail kind of wagging behind it.   Watched this maybe 2 seconds, then suddenly, a flash of blue, and the fireball was gone, and I recall expecting the object to be round, maybe a meteor, but instead it was HALF OF A CIRCLE in shape, with the front shaped flatish, and on each side of the front, I somehow made out two sets (of two) antennae-like protrusions. (changing of colors due to coming out of orbit, likely though I do not know the technical term for it, but like a spacecraft that hits the outer layers of sky on Earth, and going through that, and then suddenly having gone through it, and there was a flash of blue when it did that)   As soon as I realized this half-circle shape, with the strange aparatus protrusions, I was taken so aback that I didn't watch it any longer, and it was gone.

Appeared as orbs to begin with, then took other shapes.;2017-07-04 21:00:00;10-12 minutes;Appeared as orbs to begin with, then took other shapes. Was sitting at my sisters house near Lake Whatcom.  Several different shaped craft appeared at different times.  Some were shaped like a pearl necklace, others looked like drones.  I have pictures of these craft some 15 to 20 all together.  I am in the process of having them copyrighted for publication. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested permission to look at the photos.  PD));48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Yellowish-green glowing object over Bellingham, WA;2017-07-29 23:00:00;5 seconds;Yellowish-green glowing object over Bellingham, WA Was in my back yard last night around 10:45 and saw a far-off object and just kept my eye on it because I thought it might be a satellite and wanted to watch it go by.  It was going really fast, faster than the satellites and faster than the airplanes that come by my home.  It also was much lower than a satellite or plane.  Looked for blinking lights on an airplane and there were none. As it came within clear view, my mouth dropped open â€“ it was a glowing greenish yellow and I immediately thought about the glowsticks that kids use at Halloween.  The shape was really odd, not seemingly aerodynamic at all - it was rounded and I feel like it had two rounded parts hooked together â€“ not discs though.  It was completely silent and very big and much lower in the sky than even the small airplanes. I took two steps out further into my yard when it got the closest to me so I wouldnâ€™t lose sight of it as it went byâ€¦ and it disappeared.  Either the lights went completely dark or it actually disappeared.   Never have seen anything like this before â€“ I just stood there with my mouth open.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Transparent Inverted V shaped, with 5 circles lining the V, no sound, very close, slow moving;2017-10-29 02:35:00;3 minutes;transparent Inverted V shaped, with 5 circles lining the V, no sound, very close, slow moving I saw a transparent grey inverted V shaped ship.  On the V it had 5 circular shapes in the bottom of the V. Possibly could have been lights but it was transparent.  It made NO sound at all, was flying above the power lines very slowly. I tried to call my husband over, but it seemed so close I didn't want to draw attention.  I looked away for a second, to get my husbands attention, and when I looked back into the sky, it was gone.  I did see something, was close, transparent, quite and slow miving...  Never seen anything like it before in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
