I was driving home between Bellingham and Mount Baker. It was a very dark evening. I noticed a pinkish/purple light glow off to my left, and notice what I mistook for the moon at first. Then I realized it was too low to be the moon, and it had a light trail following it. It then disappeared into the glow. The glow stayed, but the moon had disappeared. It was the same size and shape as a waning moon, with the dark area on the right yet the light trail was also on the right, which did not make sense to me. What really didn't make sense was how fast it disappeared into the glow. The rest of the sky was clouded and black. I tried to keep an eye on the glow, but the mountains were in the way after I passed the straight-away I had been on.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
A strobing sphere on the wester horizen;2002-08-28 22:54:00;still watching;A strobing sphere on the wester horizen strobing colors of red and blue. Mostly white strobe. Appears to be moving directly west in tight spiral motion.Low on the horizon.    Appears to be stationary now but still strobing. We have been watching it thru a telescope. I first noticed it with just my eyes about 35 minutes ago. It has dropped lower on the horizen now. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at a twinkling star, but that is a guess.  PD));48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Bright reflective sphere high in the sky on a sunny day;2005-03-10 15:15:00;10-15 minutes;Bright reflective sphere high in the sky on a sunny day While doing some spring cleaning of our gutters I noticed a bright object high in the sky and nearly due east of our house, which is located 2 miles east of downtown Bellingham, WA.  I would estimate this object was 50-60 degrees above the horizon.  It appeared to be a bright star, except that the weather is sunny today.   The sky was blue and bright, so it did not make sense to me that this was a star.  I thought it could be an airplane, except it was not moving.  I watched the object for about 10 minutes to see if it moved (using a nearby pine tree as a gauge), and it did not.   By this time I had attracted the attention of my 8-year-old sons, one of whom also spotted the object once I pointed it out.  While he watched it, I went into the house to get my binoculars.   I found the object through the binoculars and it appeared to be a spherical shape and I could tell it was either white or metallic - it was very reflective.  I could not see any other details.   By this time the object had started to drift to the north or northeast.  We watched it for another 5-10 minutes until it slowly drifted behind some tall trees.   During the entire viewing period, I would estimate the object moved a total distance of the length of my thumb held at arm's length.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Orange Floating Orbs On The Horizon;2011-07-04 23:10:00;3 Minutes;Orange Floating Orbs On The Horizon Four of us were walking home from the marina after the fireworks show tonight, when we noticed a small, orange, softly-lit sphere floating upwards from the horizon.  It was about 5x the size of a star.  Several seconds afterwards, a second sphere appeared, identical to the first.  Both continued to float slowly and steadily upwards, occasionally flickering.   Eventually, the first one faded out, and we left before seeing the last one leave.  The wind was Westerly, and we looking in the Northwest direction.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Bright star-like object, thought it was a star until jet seemed to engage....;2011-12-21 21:00:00;15-30 min.;Bright star-like object, thought it was a star until jet seemed to engage.... I witnessed something tonight that I still have a hard time really accepting, but it is what I saw and it was really amazing, to be honest. There was (I have no checked to see if it is still there, it hadnt left when I had..) a rather bright object in the sky, that was pulsating / flashing various colors.  Blue, red, whites, greens, yellows. All colors, similiar to that of a twinkling star.  I initially felt it WAS a twinkling star. No movement, just oddly large and had VERY erratic color movement, it would dim out completely and come back at times. So I called my father down to see it, and as we watched, we saw  a jet off to the left of the object. Bear in mind this was at 9:00 pm tonight here in Bellingham WA, so we couldnt actually see the jet, just the red flashing wing light indicating its presence, and occassionally its green light. We noticed it was flying below but towards the object.. and as it was about to pass, it did a very dramatic curve up towards the object, and as it did it left a trail of very bright orange behind it, like that of possibly afterburner? Or even missile trail, although it trailed behind the craft so my guess is afterburner, and I mean this thing did a sideways U shape in the sky back towards the object. As it did the jet itself was rather bright, I am not sure why this is, perhaps just the light off it. The object reacted however, this was the first time it moved. It veered fairly quickly to its left, meanwhile the jet retracted and headed back towards us, which was parallel to the direction it was originally heading, which we found quite odd. It flew nearby and passed over, and the objec! t remained in the sky. We noticed other jets circling the area, but none of them appeared to engage, rather one of them turned towards us and again flew over head, the other I am not sure where it went, I lost it in the nights sky. I try to remain skeptical, but I know my aircraft, and I know what I saw.  No commercial airliner is going to pull that U in the sky like that in the first place, and the fact it did it to go directly at the object...?  That's just too much to over look.  I stayed for awhile longer, but w/ nothing going on besides the objects rather beautiful pulse, I went back inside, it was freezing out.  To most my story will be crazy, or they will come up w/ an explanation..  But nothing explains that jet doing what it did in regards to the 'star', and the star MOVING.  That was a RUSH to watch, I was in complete amazement.  My father was dumbfounded as well. Sorry, long story. But it's just something incredible to me.  I wish I could've seen more, or own a camera (I do have a cell phone, but its ancient, it cannot record video...) and wish more people would've seen it, it seems like people are sometimes oblivious to what goes on in the sky above them â€¦;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

Red Orb lights over Bellingham and out over the bay.;2013-07-04 23:30:00;10 minutes;Red Orb lights over Bellingham and out over the bay. July 4th, 2013 Bellingham, Washington, around 11:30 pm after the fireworks. At Boulevard Park, after the fireworks show, leaving at the tail end of the crowd, walking out over the bay on that jetty walkway, I and my friend stopped to observe the stars in the sky as it was so clear and they were so beautiful, we were looking straight overhead when we both noticed three strange red lights pass overhead, from over the city of Bellingham and out to the bay and beyond.   We were able to track them for quite awhile, I would guess they were moving at around 10 miles an hour. These lights were red, seemed to be about 2 to 3 foot in diameter and about 100 to 200 feet above us as they traveled silently, steadily and smoothly on their course. I would describe the object as having no detail and looking like round, orb-like red lights. I am a graphic designer, 54 years old.  My friend is a musician 57 years old.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

It was about 100 yards up, 8 feet in diameter and stationary.   Stopped to take a closer look at nearby parking lot.   Looked for wires or advertising, there was none.   Watched it for about 2 minutes, and went to work.   It was gone later that day.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
