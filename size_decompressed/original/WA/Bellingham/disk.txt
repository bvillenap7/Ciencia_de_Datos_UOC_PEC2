I was paralyzed and watched them for an unknown amount of time. Before I knew it, they were gone. 3 discs, I don't know how big, metallic looking, possible lines on the side. They hovered and paralyzed me. It made a low pitched sound that I could feel in my teeth. The power was out at my house. I could see their shadows cast on the ground from the streetlights. The air pulsated around them. I don't remember much else. I've never seen anything like it before. When I got inside my house, all the clocks were blinking, as if there had been a power outage. I got scared and ran over to my boyfriend's house. He thought I ws crazy. I'm a biology major in college. And I don't usually believe in this kind of stuff. But what I saw really scared me. I want to talk to someone who will understand me. None of my roommates remember anything like this happening. They think I'm crazy too. But I know what I saw was real.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Large, Sunlight reflecting metallic  saucer seen in Bellingham, Wa.;2001-07-25 18:30:00;20 minutes;Large, Sunlight reflecting metallic  saucer seen in Bellingham, Wa. Saw a very bright saucer shaped object that was approximately 1.5 - 2 miles west of my position. It's position was near the Bellingham Airport. Above it. The object remained stationary and seemed to have another smaller object hovering near it. Smaller object was undiscernable except for the sun reflecting off of it. The Larger ufo object was highly noticeable because of the brightness of the sunlight that was reflecting from it. I did not see it move at all, but it was appearing be about 1000 feet in altitude. I got tired of looking at it after 20 minutes because it was hard to look at because of the brightness, then when I looked again it was gone. and the smaller light reflecting object was gone also. I could not discern any details about the craft except for it's basic saucer like shape and twas metallic and reflecting light. also was  fairly large because it was  a ways away, maybe not over a half mile, but I couldnt be sure.. Seemed like it was more like 1-2 miles in distance from me. The airport was  about a mile from my position at the time. The smaller object may have been a helicopter, butI couldnt hear a thing.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Found oblect in picture upon downloading them at home.;2004-06-20 12:15:00;unknown;Found oblect in picture upon downloading them at home. We were trying out our new digital camera while on Chuckanut Mt. My wife wanted a photo of the bay and Lummi Island from there so we stopped and took the picture. Later that day, I downloaded the pictures to see how the new camera compared to our older one. She wanted me to print an 8x10 of her shot which I did. I discovered a strange dot in the photo and zoomed in on the dot. It appears to be a disk shape between Eliza Island and Lummi Island. There is about a mile between the two islands and approximately four miles between us and Lummi.When I reverse the color to negative, it appears to be quite metallic with the light reflecting off of it.  I will be dropping a disk in the mail to you with a copy of this description.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
I saw a military disc shaped craft hovering low over a house on Bennett Drive.;2005-11-05 18:30:00;20 min;This was a very foggy night.   As I drove up Bennett Drive toward the A&P corner store I saw a military disc shaped craft hovering low over a house on Bennett Drive.   I stopped for 15 min and watched it hover there.  The bottom of the disc was visible just under the fog and I could see a dish shaped antenna on the bottom of the craft. It was a grey color and about 150 feet across.  I was about 100 feet away from it and could see clearly that it had a dish attached to the bottom of it.  I took some pictures and made a sketch of it when I got home. It was there for about 20 min and then flew away up into the fog. I got the impression that it was a miltarly disc because it had this dish attached on the bottom of it.  I was really scared and thought the government would put me in jail just for reporting it.  Now I have been ask to leave my apartment here and don't care what they do to me when they find out what I saw and reported.

Five Glowing Orbs in the sky;2013-01-01 00:00:00;5 minutes;Five Glowing Orbs in the sky At exactly midnight my partner went to see if there were any firework shows to celebrte the new year.  She noticed five bright orbs hovering over the neighborhood sky.  She called me to quickly look and I tried to adjust my eyes to fully comprehend what I was looking at.   Meanwhile, my mother in law got up to look as well as I ran to find my camera.  Two dissapeared together simultaniously and then the other two, and finally the last one.  We researched further and noticed they were similar to Phoenix lights back in 1997.  Quite a way to start the new year!!;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

Bright neon blue disc flew incredibly fast and completely silent across the night sky.;2014-08-18 22:14:00;2 seconds;Bright neon blue disc flew incredibly fast and completely silent across the night sky. I just saw one bright blue disc (almost neon) fly across the sky from my apartment parking lot.  I didn’t see it until it was right over me and it took about 2 seconds to soar across until it was out of my view.   This seems like a very far distance for an aircraft to travel so incredibly fast.  If I had blinked, I think I might have missed it.   It was about the size of a quarter (seemed quite large for being so far away) and it was FAST and absolutely SILENT.   The sky was pitch black.  It was such a bright glowing blue that it lit up the sky directly around it.  I didn’t hear anything.   I have “goosebumps” because of how eerie, silent, and fast it was.
