It was a clear night and I was out to watch the Perseid meteor shower. I am a university teacher who has lived in Bellingham for 7 years.  I am interested in UFO phenomena, but have never seen anything unusual before.  On the evening of August 10, 1997, I was outside at 11:30 pm watching for shooting stars when I saw what I thought was a satellite.  It was very dim, almost invisible, and I only noticed it because of the faint movement.  As I watched, the satellite suddenly flashed a brilliant yellow light.  The original light in the sky was barely a pinprick, but the flash was as large as my pinky nail held at arms length.  After the flash, the satellite seemed to disappear.  I could then make out faint movement and a tiny pinprick of light and then the object flashed again.  It moved in an east-to-west trajectory and flashed about every ten seconds until it went out of my line of sight.  I estimate that I watched the object for approximately 2, maybe 3 minutes.  I went inside, through the house, to see if it was visible from my front porch! (I had been on my back deck).  It wasn't.  I wonder is anyone else has seen something similar?;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Strange Light In Sky That Did Not Follow Any Rules Of Astrophysics That I Was Familiar With!;1998-06-15 21:00:00;2 seconds;Strange Light In Sky That Did Not Follow Any Rules Of Astrophysics That I Was Familiar With! I was driving East on Smith Rd. on the I5 overpass at about 9pm when all of a sudden, I noticed what appeared to be a normal shooting star off to my right side.  When all of a sudden it shot back up in a 30Â° angle and then completely disappeared . It didn't fade out or follow other patterns that I have ever experienced with a meteorite before. I had not seen any proof of other people experiencing this same event, nor any mentions of it in the local newspaper, so I just convinced  myself that I must have imagined it and tried to forget about it over the years until I was at a gathering 5 years later and was speaking to an acquaintance.  Somehow the subject came up of seeing strange things in the sky that couldn't be explained.  When he started to speak about my exact same experience 5 years ago, I was in shock!  There was actually another witness that could corroborate and validate my story!;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

I picked my friend Eli up from his house and was on my way home. I was driving over a brigde and then we saw it.  It was a brilliant shiny ball of light. I'd say it was half mile to a mile away from us, and was probably a coupple hundred feet in the air above the trees. It moved super fast down, then up, then zig zaged, and then went down again and then it completely vanished.  It was like nothing i've seen before.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
A white object flew down a valley at dusk.;2000-07-30 21:25:00;10 seconds;A white object flew down a valley at dusk. I was sitting on the balcony of my home. The sun had set and it was dusk. The back of my place looks out across a valley, with hills on the other side about as high as the one my home is on. I saw a small object make a straight line course down the valley, from the NE to the SW. It was below the tops of the hills on the other side of the valley. The object was very small, my initial impression was that it was a seagull, which I see a lot of around here, but this appeared to be traveling in a straight line, the altitude did not vary, it did not change course that I could see and it was much faster than a seagull. My impression was that it was closer to the other side of the valley than the side I was on. I can't say the object glowed or reflected the last of the daylight, but it appeard to be white. It did not appear to make a sound, but I-5 is nearby, and if the object were quiet, I could see how the noise from I-5 could drownd it out. The whole incident could not have taken 7 - 10 seconds. It was too fast and small to be a propellor driven airplane, obviously it was far too small, and also too quiet to be a jet plane, really too low to be any sort of plane, too quiet to be a helicopter, too fast and flying too straight to be a bird, going horizontal so it couldn't have been a balloon or meteorite, so, what was it? I'm out of guesses. Professionally, I am a counselor by profession and have held an office manager position for three years as well as pursuing my professional practice.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Extremely Bright Object Crosses Sky at Twilight (at least 2x brightness Sirius/planets);2002-06-09 22:36:00;60 seconds;Extremely Bright Object Crosses Sky at Twilight (at least 2x brightness Sirius/planets) When I got home at 10:30 06/09/02 I stood to have a cigarette on the front porch. My house faces north across the bay in Bellingham proper. Because of the city light pollution only a few of the brightest stars were out by this time, and quite dim. That is why I saw the object at once, it came over the roof of a house low on the north horizen. It was an extremely bright point of light, yellowish white. As it approached it became brighter. I am not good with the luminosity scale but it was definitly twice as bright as any of the planets or Sirius, and moving across the horizen quite fast. I assumed it was a satallite, although I have never seen one moving so fast, and fenitely never seen one so bright. As the object passed my position and began to move south, I noticed the trailing edge seemed to tail out slightly. The color or appearance did not change--it looked like a very, very bright star, moving very quickly. As soon as it passed over head I ran inside to get my roomate to see what he thought. In the 10 seconds it took me to run inside and get back out with him it was far to the south, still moving quickly. To the south lie mountains, but our view was abscured by rooftops. Before it dissapeared over them the object faded from extremely bright to very dim, and then faded from view. Chris (roomate) said it must have been a satallite, but I am not so sure. It faded from view a fair ways above the horizen. When I noticed it, it was just barely above the horizen to the north across the bay, and was extremely bright. When we saw it fade from view it was not even close to the horizen to the south, of which I am sure the rooftop of our house is far above it and we were standing out in the front lawn. Perhaps the twilight can explain that behavior. I only make the report because of the extreme brightness and speed, I do not think a satellite could reflect so much light. The Space Station perhaps?

My dad was the first one to spot it, he was looking out at the bay when his attention was drawn to one of the island areas. At first it was a VERY bright light, it was stationary for a long time, then the light shut off, but whatever it was, was still there. It looked more flat, but with a slight dome on the top. I managed to get a picture of it when the light was off, a little while later it was totally gone. It came back to the exact same spot two weeks ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was PERFECTLY shaped absolutely incredible.  (I wished I had a camera or a cell phone to call someone!)  Suddenly I saw a white light fall into the top of the cloud.  It was just a white object kind of glowy - a little bigger than a star.  I walked on and continued looking at the mountain.  As the sun continued to rise from up behind the mountain, the lenticular cloud changed into a MASSIVE glowing white domed UFO shape - it was truly STAGGERING! Then a second white object fell into the top of the mountain. I continued walking and watching.  In a few minutes a THIRD object 'fell' into the top of the mountain but it was about 2 times bigger than the other two.  That's it. It was truly one of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen!;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Little white dot visible very high in the daylight sky;2004-05-05 17:00:00;15 minutes;Little white dot visible very high in the daylight sky I was laying back on the grass at Zuanich Point in Bellingham, WA. We (me and my husband) were looking at a plane flying by, when I saw a little white dot way up in the sky. It seemed to be stationary, and it was too high to be a bird, or plane, or cloud. It was very tiny, just a little white dot. About the size of this period . to my eyes. It was visible for about 10-15 minutes, and all the while I was trying to point it out to my husband. However, it was hard to see unless you happened upon it, like I did. I looked away a few times, and was able to find it again. After awhile, I looked away, and then tried to find it again and couldn't find it again.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Red/orange light over Bellingham, Washington;2007-12-12 17:45:00;7-10 minutes;Red/orange light over Bellingham, Washington My 22 year old son and I had just left my house, heading southwest. Straight ahead, about a 45 degree angle, we saw a single medium to bright light. I asked him to watch it as I was driving. I asked him to look for the red and green sidelights to see if it was a plane. He could not see anything. He mentioned that we could be seeing the headlight(s) of a small plane. I said that I didnât think they had headlights of that color. I made a left 90 degree turn. The light was nearing our position, so I could not see it anymore but he could. He rolled down his window to listen for noises. He could hear nothing. When I got to the next intersection there was a store there with a large parking lot. I pulled in and parked, turned off my lights and engine and got out of the car. By the time I saw it again it was almost directly above me and moving slowly to the North. My son asked if it could be a helicopter and again, I didnât think they had lights of that color. He suggested that it might be a hot air balloon. The color of the light did look like it could be a flame of some sort, being a red/orange shade. That made the most sense, although if it were a balloon you would be able to see the outline of the balloon as the flame would ignite the air inside the balloon, giving us a good view of the shape and size of the balloon, if not the colors of he silk. We could see no shape of any balloon and there was no obvious basket below the object for holding the people who would be operating the balloon.  He mentioned that he thought the light was flickering as a flame would. Just as he said this the flame flickered out and disappeared. We waited, thinking that if it were a balloon, the operator would have to re-ignite the flame to keep the balloon from falling. There were no sounds of attempts to re-ignite the flame and there was no more light. We could not see anything falling to the ground, even at a slow rate given for the hot air of a balloon to cool, bringing the balloon down. The sighting lasted about seven minutes. It was approximately 5:45pm, Wednesday, December 12, 2007, in the very Northwest corner of Washington State, about 30 minutes south of the Canadian border. There was a wispy cloud cover of about 1000 feet, but we couldnât even see the diluted light of a flame going through the clouds. We continued on our way with my son watching for a return of the light, while I drove. I arrived back home about 30 minutes later, not having see the light again.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Moving, unblinking, fading from very bright to dull silvery-white light (about three times a planet's size);2008-01-07 07:00:00;5 minutes;Moving, unblinking, fading from very bright to dull silvery-white light (about three times a planet's size) On my way to the school bus stop in the morning at about 7:00 AM, I looked up in the sky and saw a silvery-white moving light, almost like a moving planet, but a lot brighter. The size of the light was about three time that of a planet's viewed from earth (like Venus). The object faded from very bright intensity to dull (like how bright a star is) about 2-3 times as I watched it. It made no sound at all, so I doubt it was a helicopter, and there were no blinking lights, so I don't think it was an airplane. At first I thought it might be a satellite, but it was not traveling in a straight line. First, it was moving to the north-west, and as I watched it it changed direction and came towards me in an east direction. It continued at a steady speed, which was faster then an airplane could go, passed almost directly over me, and continued on in an easterly direction, until I couldn't see it anymore because a house blocked my view.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
2 green wobbly lights  hovering at my second story window, 3 times about 10 minutes apart lasting  5 seconds each.;2008-05-16 02:30:00;5 seconds;2 green wobbly lights  hovering at my second story window, 3 times about 10 minutes apart lasting  5 seconds each. Around 2:30 a.m. I awoke and saw at my window 2 round green lights about the same size as a traffic light. It was as if someone was shining them to look inside my window. They were around the top part of my window near the roof. There are no traffic lights in my residential neighborhood. The lights wobbled as if someone was walking with a flashlight.  Outside my bedroom window is my deck which is on the second floor and no one can access without a ladder. The lights wobbled and then went away. I thought it was just a reflection of something inside the house. Then it happened again and I awoke my dog to go out onto the deck with me to see if anyone was there. Nobody was. So I came back inside and went into my bedroom and it happened again. About 5 seconds each time. My dog saw it too and his ears went up.  I live overlooking Puget Sound and off in the distance I saw an aircraft flying south. I called 911 to report and they said they didn't have any other calls and they confirmed that we have no flights leaving our airport at that time. But it could have been a medivac helicopter at the local hospital so maybe that is not even related to my experience. Anyway, that's it. It was really eerie and there was no sound accompanied with the lights and nobody on the street or anywhere around my house when I went out to the deck to look.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

It was 2:16 am, 6/16/09. My friend calls me, and says he is looking at a UFO. Its a crazy light in the sky, out over the ocean. He described a light like a star, but changing color abnormally, and dropping other lights out of it. I was skeptical, but the sound in his voice unnerved me. I decided to take a look for my self. he described the location to me, in reference to the big-dipper. At first i didn't see anything, but soon had a VERY clear visual conformation. All the hair on my head was standing up, and I could barely maintain my composer. A bright light in the western sky, moving around in circles and lines. It was creating shapes and changing color. also little red lights would occasionally fall from the moving light. About twenty-five minutes into the colorful display, a helicopter from a near by hospital, flew near by where I was. This gave me a nice compairssion. This was not a helicopter, and was not that far away. At this point I was kinda scared. The next thing to happen really freaked me out! A small light appeared a good distance North from the original object. I saw it first, and asked my friend if he too saw this new light. As soon as he saw it it burst into a massive bright light. It was moving smoothly, and got brighter and brighter. It was south bound, headed right for the other one. As this light approached the first, it dimmed and slowed. At this point I could no longer doubt what I was seeing. The original light was still in the sky when I started this report. I have my friend on the phone, and he told me it left. I went out side to see, and sure enough it is now gone. My friends Girl friend also witnessed this event.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

Looked like a normal satelite traveling at normal satelite speed but with a consistant brightness (probably because it was just after sunset).   As it passed overhead there was a second much dimmer light following at the exact same speed and in the same direction which was about a thumbs length away with a fully extended arm.   I suspect this was either some sort of satelite array or maybe the ISS and a transport ship?  Have any ideas?  O know the ISS is dues for a delivery.

My husband came upstairs and said, there's something you need to see.  Standing on our deck, looking over Lake Whatcom, we observed an orange/yellow light in a stationary position over the lake about the size of a quarter held at arms length.  It stayed in position about 1.5 minutes and then accelerated quickly straight up and disappeared in about 15 seconds from the point of acceleration.  A second light then appeared, taking relatively the same position as the first, and again hovered for about 1.5 minutes and then accelerated upwards along the same trajectory as the first and again disappeared out of sight into the night sky. The light we observed was a light yellow / orange.  We could not see any sort of craft, just this illumination.  We speculated that perhaps it was an object carrying a fire of some sort, or a lantern.  However, to see it as we did, my husband noted it would have to be a fire of great size to illuminate over the distance.  As well, it was not flickering, and it was a focused bright light.

Three lights in line formation.  Disappeared in about 1 minute;2011-07-04 22:40:00;1 minute;Three lights in line formation.  Disappeared in about 1 minute My wife and some friends were standing in an open lot behind a plywood factory watching the 4th of July celebration.   During the event we noticed three small, bright lights appeared northeast of our position.  The three lights appeared to be several miles away judging by the distortions or twinkle of the lights and appeared to be orange to almost red in color.  Initially, I believed them to be some sort of aircraft in a line formation as the judged altitude was about 3000-4000 ft with motion and speed consistent with an aircraft. As I watched, I realized the lighting was inconsistent with any aircraft beacons or navigational lighting.  The light emitted was a constant reddish-orange. The objects appeared to be traveling in a southwest direction towards us.  As they neared, all three objects gradually faded, sequentially disappeared one after the other.   Nothing unusual was further seen afterwords.   Weather conditions at the time were very clear with a slight breeze from the southwest. I am convinced this was something very out of the ordinary as I have very extensive knowledge of aircraft patterns in the area and am very familiar with civilian and military aircraft types.   I do not believe it was any kind of firework either as the position of these lights observed were 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon and did not have a trajectory consistent with any kind of firework.  Even a flare suspended by a parachute could not have done this as the wind was blowing opposite the direction of travel. By trade I am an automotive technician.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Red light  travels across Bellingham, Washington sky and vanishes.;2011-08-18 21:44:00;2-3 minutes;Red light  travels across Bellingham, Washington, sky and vanishes. I observed a single bright red light, slightly larger than a standard bright star, in the eastern night sky at approximately 9:45pm Pacific Standard Time on Thursday, August 18, 2011.   At first I thought the light might have been an exceptionally clear and bright Mars, but I realized quickly that the light was too vivid and bright to be a planet and called my cousin outside to witness it with me.  The light seemed stationary at first, at about 50 degrees above the horizon, but then slowly moved northward.  While the light traveled north, it may have changed speed a few times.  It also pulsed quickly all the while, like a star between slightly more bright and slightly more dim. As it neared the north sky, the light began an exponential decent towards the horizon and flickered between much brighter and very dim.  Around this time my cousin thought he may have heard a sound like a plane crashing to the earth.  Then the light simply vanished at about 20 degrees from the horizon and was not seen by us again, even though we watched the sky for 5 to ten minutes afterward.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

It was at twilight, and, naturally expecting the stars to come out, we noticed one in-particular that was moving rapidly across the sky as a solid orb (no red/green plane marking or flashes, and it was moving away from us and was still extremely bright) as it moved across the sky, its speed increased exponentially, tilted upward and disappeared then, we saw what we thought was a star by the moon suddenly move left, upwards, and left again till it went still.  Three more bright lights appeared overhead and moved upwards, left and right until either settling in a fixed position or slowly continuing in their direction.  At last check two of the three stars that appeared have since disappeared and one is stopping and moving slowly upwards (and this is not an illusion of star movement based on the earth's rotation, it's much too rapid).

I've seen the triangular array the US Navy uses for it's subs and this was very similar, only all three were heading in a straight line.  If the weather clears tonight I will be going out around the same time to see if I can spot it again.  I highly doubt anything extraterrestrial, but cool to spot none the lessâ¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Intl. Space Station and supply ship, flying in close formation, we suspect.

Orange lights in V formation and pairs.;2014-04-27 23:00:00;30 minutes;Orange lights in V formation and pairs. The lights were orange and diamond or bird-shaped (the chevron shape a child would draw a bird.)  The first pair we saw sort of chased each other and wiggled a lot, enough to make me think it might have been some space junk falling.  But it went fast and straight into the distance.   Then there was a v formation of five or six going in the same direction on the same path about five minutes later.  Then a lone one.  Then another pair  went by side by side.   And then ten or twenty minutes later they flew back from the direction they had gone in a bigger v formation, they were not going the same way they had come more of 90 degree angle from some farther away point.   We were star gazing on a roof when we spotted these.  They were silent and moved about as fast as I've seen fighter jets go (Wich theses may have been?)  They were silent though. No physics defying movements.  The formations were not perfect.  It was really clear out.  The lights seemed like they may have been heading for the bellingham airport, but they were very low and we saw no planes or plane lights or shapes connected to the moving lights.   The lights did not leave trails. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she corrected the time of the sighting.  She reports that it occurred at some time, she estimates, between 10:00 p.m. and midnight on Sunday night, April 27, 2014.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to previous report:   When witnessing the event I was laying on my back with my feet towards the south west.  The lights crossed from left to right towards the north west. The final large V formation appeared from right to left many minutes later heading east.. These lights did not move directly above us as the first ones had but were towards the northern horizon and we sat up and looked behind us to watch it go.  I would compare the path of their first trajectory to the trajectory of the final V as a 45 degree angle.  The lights disappeared into the horizon before returning as he final V came into sight.  The sighting took place on railroad avenue from the roof. ((END ADDENDUM));48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

It zig-zagged, disappeared, and reappeared several times, before disappearing into the night. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date to August 17, 2014.  PD));48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Orange light/flare rising quickly, changing directions fairly rapidly, blinking twice then disappearing.;2014-08-31 12:30:00;45 seconds;Orange light/flare rising quickly, changing directions fairly rapidly, blinking twice then disappearing. Orange light in the South/East, me and my friend were out smoking on the porch.  The light was very consistent color and bright, like it could have been a flare.  I saw it through binoculars and I couldn't discern any shape.   After it got a ways into the sky it changed directions, either heading towards or away from us.  It dimmed quickly, brightened, dimmed again, brightened, then disappeared.  Very little to no wind, and I confirmed this by watching the clouds move in relation to the few visible stars.   My roommate said that he saw this exact object earlier in August, but I don't know when.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
10-15 yellow orange lights south of Bellingham.;2015-12-31 20:30:00;10-15 minutes;10-15 yellow orange lights south of Bellingham Observed from Canada by an airport control tower.   10-15 yellow orange lights slowly moving across the sky in trail and very loose formation.   Came into sight low over horizon distant south east of Bellingham and disappeared approximately over Whidbey Island at what seemed to be a high altitude.   Did not climb or descend, but just tracked across the southern sky from east to west until they disappeared, one or two at a time.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Light formations.;2016-05-27 21:54:00;10 minutes;Light Formations Was driving down from my home on San Juan Blvd. turned onto Puget to head down the hill to the 7-11 on lakeway... at the top of said hill you can see out across the bay toward Lummi Island and the Salish Sea.  I saw 20+ reddish orange objects take off from what looked like at least 8-13 miles out from the sea in a north easterly direction...   I took some video, then went to the store than left a good 5 minutes later, drove back up the hill towards my house when I stopped and looked back out off the hill they were still taking off.   There was no sound what so ever as you would expect from modern day military aircraft.. I've never known a airliner to fly in formation either...  9:54 pm pacific time.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

I just took my dog out for his last bathroom run, when I noticed a light that, at first, I thought it was a satellite.  It was much brighter than a satellite, and as I stared at it passing across the night sky in a mostly easterly direction, I realized the altitude was much lower than what a satellite would be at.  It also seemed it wasn't maintaining a constant speed, sort of slowing a bit and then resuming an otherwise constant speed.   I found it so unusual, I ran out to the end of our dock on Lake Whatcom and watched it eventually disappear over the distant mountains.  Never seen anything like it before. Wondering if anyone else noticed this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Multiple orbs/crafts with lights of purple, blue, green and red flying in weird patterns and creating multiple formations.;2017-05-13 22:49:00;30 minutes;Multiple orbs/crafts with lights of purple, blue, green and red flying in weird patterns and creating multiple formations. Last night, at 10:49p.m, me and 5 other witnesses all saw the same thing last night with the UFO Sightings.  It first started with two friends calling for us to come outside to see if what they were seeing was actually happening.   There were four orbs first 3 green, one was blue and the other red flying with a movement that did not resemble a shooting star, jet, airplane or satellite in a square like formation.  They created a diamond shape formation as pictured below with the two of the greens being capture in the photo and the blue directly in the middle of the two simultaneously flashing.   A few minutes later, a set of eight lights cane from the east creating multiple formations that can't be described, but again the all had the same colors as the others green, blue, red and some white.   Then continued to the same location where the others traveled and stopped in the same area the diamond formation stated earlier was created, still simultaneously flashing in a distinct! pattern.  theb moments later two more sets of the exact same color maybe a total of 16 8 in each group came from the east again flying in the strangest pattern and formation ever witnessed.   I tried my best explains in the both videos what they were doing as far as movement, I know that this seems unreal but what we saw last night again was REAL there were no airplanes, shooting stars, jets, or helicopters in sight.   The formations that these lights created in the sky and the maneuvering of them is beyond hard to explain in writing.  So I hope my videos do me and my friends some justice on what we seen and someone can explain what they were. Thank you!;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Connected three lights converge and disappear;2019-05-10 01:30:00;3-4 seconds;Connected three lights converge and disappear Three lights come together and disappear. 05/10/2019 01:30  am Sudden Valley, (Bellingham)  Wa.  98229  Compass reading  (260 degree W.)  about 30 degree Altitude. 48,42,44 N  /  122,19.44W  At 1:30 am early morning I went on my deck to get fresh air.  Looking up in the western clear sky. Little dipper appeared to the right. As I looked down and to the left, above the treeline yet higher in the sky, but not too high, appeared three lights, connected together.  They looked as if they could be attached to each other?  Just a brief, possibly 3-4 seconds and then it appeared to have closed into themselves, but no single light, it just disappeared, lights just turned off.   Like turning on a light then turning a light off that quick. These were bright white lights, no color.  Sudden valley is very quiet, there was no sounds heard.  All three lights, together about the size of little finger nail at arm's length.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

numerous pinpricks of light following each other evenly spaced;2021-05-16 23:00:00;20 min;numerous pinpricks of light following each other evenly spaced I was looking at the night sky SW of my home. I noticed a pinprick of light moving through the sky. I have seen these before which I believe were jets flying 30,000 to 40,000 mi up and only one. The pinpricks of light I saw this time were followed by six others with the same distance apart. A moment of time past, and these six were than replaced by 40 pinpricks of light slightly further west and going east like the first six and evenly spaced like the first six. I saw a brighter light to my right coming closer to where I was. It was bright white with a yellow center. It went right over my house going east.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
