UFO caused earthquakes?;1980-12-12 20:40:00;Unknown;UFO caused earthquakes? Earthquakes shake Puget Sound area on December 7 and 12, 1880. On December 7 and 12, 1880, two earthquakes strike the Puget Sound region.  Frightened residents rush out of buildings. They are felt in Portland, Oregon, in Port Townsend, in Seattle, at the coal mines at Newcastle, and in the Stuck and Puyallup valleys in south King County.  Shortly before the December 12 earthquake, an apparent meteorite is sighted crashing into the Chuckanut Mountains just south of Bellingham.  Over the next three months a number of aftershocks follow. December 7th Earthquake  On December 7, 1880 at about 5:45 p.m., the earthquake was felt throughout the Puget Sound region. Seattle, Bainbridge Island, Tacoma, Puyallup, Olympia, and Port Townsend reported shaking.  At Seattle, People rushed into the streets from stores, restaurants and saloons.  (Seattle Post-Intelligencer, December 8, 1880). People in the Chinese district were most frightened and it was one or two hours before they calmed down.  A Mr. Atkinson, who was in Newcastle at the time of the quake, came to Seattle a few days after the earthquake that occurred later in the week and reported that the December 7 quake was stronger than the one on December 12.  At Seattle the shock waves were felt traveling from the southeast to northwest and at Bainbridge Island they were felt traveling from north to south. December 12th Earthquake  On Sunday December 12, 1880 at about 8:40 p.m., the second Puget Sound earthquake of the week was felt strongly in Seattle.  It was more severe than the December 7 quake.  A witness of the 1880 earthquake, a Seattle resident, wrote in 1904 to the Seattle Post Intelligencer:  It was so sharp that it caused people who were on the streets to stagger.  It was a Sabbath evening and quite a large congregation was at church on Third Avenue   The shock alarmed the worshippers and they arose en masse.  One lady fainted and a panic was narrowly averted by the minister and one cool-headed man who stood near the door (Seattle Post-Intelligencer, March 20, 1904, p. 1). In Seattle, “Dogs in the street howled and horses endeavored to escape from their stalls” added the December 16, 1880 Port Townsend Democratic Press. The quake caused lamps hung from a 16-foot high ceiling at a house located at the northwest corner of 2nd Avenue and James Street to swing six to eight feet. At another dwelling, a chimney fell. At the south end of King County, residents along the Stuck and Puyallup valleys stated that the quake moved the earth like ocean swells. A Meteorite?  Just before the December 12 earthquake, a Seattle resident reported witnessing what “seemed to be two very large balls of fire that appeared in the clear sky a short distance apart and hung as in balance an instant, and then darted down and toward each other until they crashed and disappeared. A moment afterwards came the shock” (The Seattle Weekly Post, December 17, 1880). A Whatcom County paper reported witnessing a meteorite that descended into the Chuckanut Mountains. It is unknown whether this strange event was the cause of the quake. The December 12 earthquake was felt from Portland to Port Townsend, where it lasted about 11 seconds. It was not felt at Victoria, British Columbia, or at Neah Bay near Cape Flattery, the northwest point of Washington. During the following three months, a Bainbridge Island resident reported three more aftershocks in December, five aftershocks in January 1881, two aftershocks in February 1881, and a single aftershock on March 14, 1881.

Meteor lands in Whatcom County.;2005-02-23 20:09:00;<1.5 sec.;Meteor lands in Whatcom County. This was definitely a meteor, but I am unable to find any reports of it the next day.  It was the most brilliant, whitest object by far I have ever seen in the night sky in all my 65 years.  Had a very short tail.  It came down at a 40 degree angle and disappeared behind some low hills at the horizon about 2 mi. away.  I viewed it from near the south shore of Bellingham Bay looking east.  The sky was very clear.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Amber lights on trail.;2005-08-15 03:00:00;15 minutes;Amber lights on trail . In the woods along a trail in Bellingham, WA (connecting to Alabama St). I was almost to Alabama st, coming from the direction of Haggen on  the trail.  It started with a bright ORANGE (amber) light (like a fire ball) way down the trail.  This was about three am back in August of 2005. I thought  what I was seeing was another person or(two to three people -I thought) with head lamps on their heads (looked like a ball of fire or orb of  light 6 wide -from way down the trail).  I was by myself and thought -I'll walk towards the lights, they were @ the same level as a person  walking on the trail... but way down about a 1/4 mile from me.  I walked towards the lights and they became blurred -the closer I got, the more  they became one light. The lights were gone when I got to where I thought they'd be -couldn't find them on the trail.  I went to the left of the trail, over a slight  levee like hill that runs along the trail and there it was in the middle of a field. What I saw was a beam of plasma lights in a column (went every other beam was yellow and then orange -yellow, then orange)  The column  was 1 1/2ft wide and 30ft from the ground to the sky (vertical in shape) and it went every other beam, ea. beam about 1 1/2 inches wide and  30ft long -all condensed (fit tightly together) -no spaces between the beams of plasma or lasers. -orange and yellow plasma beams of light all bound up in a tight column reaching 30ft into the sky and touching the earth  (the column was  about 1 1/2 ft wide -I believe it was plasma beams of light, yet I don't know -I was afraid to go near it or touch it) I think it was scanning the ground. The whole column of light(s) was slowly rotating clockwise.  {About fifteen ft up (some of the beams) while still attached in the middle would fan out about 3 ft from the base of the light (as if scanning).} I could not see where the lights were emanating from as if that part were not visible to my eyes but I feel there was something more. What I don't know was WHY or HOW I had even been up at that hour or how I had even been walking on that trail that night. Whatever it was I was seeing frightened me.  I as far as I know only watched the lights for about 45 seconds... then crept backwards to the trail, and walked very quickly home. (Home was about 2 miles from the incident -@ that time I lived at the top of Alabama hill) I kept looking back -and even up to make sure whatever it was?   Was not after me. I told one person, my bf what happened when I got home my bf was asleep, to this day I don't know if he believes me. I remember it like yesterday.  I strangely, remember NOTHING before it happened or why I was there -in the middle of the night.  For some reason -I was walking down the trail and I don't know why -I should have been asleep (I was dressed in a shirt and shorts and had a backpack w/me). I reported this before somewhere on line (may have been here) but feel this is a more complete account of the occurrence.  There may be more that happened.  Perhaps one day I will recall the whole incident.  I no longer live in Bellingham.  One other odd thing is that sometimes I feel as thought if I were to go there to the site where I saw the incident that it could happen again.  I've been told I talk loudly in my sleep and have nightmares which I've never recalled.  I think I'm fine and am not scared of anything (so far).  I don't mind being contacted by an investigator.  I don't need to prove it to anyone -I know it was real.  I could submit a illustration of what I saw if requested.  I did draw a picture of it a while back (can re draw it).

Hovering red lights over Bellingham, WA bay;2012-06-29 21:45:00;3 minutes;Hovering red lights over Bellingham, WA bay Glowing red craft seen travelling from sw to north. 3 bright glowing red objects in the front 2 behind.  Over Bellingham bay the first 3 hovered waiting for the other 2 to reach them. Objects hovered for a period and then ascended into the clouds with no trace of their light left behind or reappearing below the clouds.   Two of us witnessed the lights ascending and hovering before disappearing. Due to the bright red lights, slower motion and hovering, I am not convinced that this was an ordinary flying object.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Drones or UFO?;2013-02-16 18:45:00;~3 minutes (?);Drones or UFO? My 2 yr old son was w his grandpa & spotted it or them?  It was 6 or so bright orange lights that did not blink and they were silently flying in a v formation but would move so it did not appear to be one object.  They seemed higher than helicopters fly (we are near hospital) but much lower than planes  (we are close to a small airport).  It was cloudy so we werent able to see much other than the lighs.  When I called a local radio station today to see if anyone reported it, he said not that he knew of but he has seen the same thing before and said it was drones.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Four fire like orbs appeared individually, gliding through the sky  all traveling in the same direction at a low  altitude.;2013-03-20 20:45:00;20 minutes;Four fire like orbs appeared individually, gliding through the sky  all traveling in the same direction at a low  altitude. Four orange glowing orbs appeared individually over a 20 minute period.  They just appeared in the sky. Each came from the South West, traveling North and then turned North West. They were 2-3 minutes apart.  They were flying about the same elevation, low, quickly and there was no sound.  They just glided through the air until they were out of sight.  These were nothing like the lights from the airplanes we could see and hear in the sky.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
3 red orange balls over Bellingham in a triangle formation.;2015-11-26 19:50:00;2 minutes;3 red orange balls over Bellingham in a triangle formation. Was driving along Interstate 5, northbound, when noticed 3 red/orange glowing balls to the west of me.  They were in a triangular formation, with two of the balls close together and the third a longer distance away.  It appeared to be stationary.  They were too big to be stars, and they weren't moving, so I concluded they were not planes.   I watched this object for maybe two minutes while trying to drive, then lost view of it behind trees and houses.   After I lost track of it, I noticed there were no large red/orange stars visible anywhere, nor did any of the planes in the sky have solid non-blinking lights.  Plus, the plane lights were smaller.  I don't know what it could have been.  But it was in a triangle formation and just sitting there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

2 bright orange UFOs moving north over Portage Island & south Lummi Island.;2016-05-13 10:03:00;About 5 minutes;2 bright orange UFOs moving north over Portage Island & south Lummi Island. My husband was out the back door having a cigarette, he came quickly through the house to the front door and said there were 2 UFOs moving north, we both were on the front deck looking south watching 2 bright orange UFOs.  We over look Bellingham Bay, we face the City of Bellingham.   One was slightly ahead of the 2nd one, moving in sync slowly north, we couldn't hear them.  They were over Portage Island, & south Lummi Island, I grabbed my sons camera off the table, checked to see if the flash was off, and took 2 pictures while on the front deck.   I moved while taking both pictures cause the aperture was slow taking a night picture & trying to focus.  After the 2nd picture they both quickly disappeared heading southward. The pictures do show how bright they were in the sky.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
