Vibrating yet silent Left Red Robin restraunt around 12:30 am.  It was a extremely cold and very clear star filled sky.  Looked up in the parking lot and observed a egg shaped clear yet irridecent bubble.  It moved slowly upward while at the same time vibrating as if something was spinning around inside the bubble causing it to wobble as if off balance.  It made no noise and was completely clear except for the appearance of a bubble... having multicolored yet clear walls. Stars could be seen through the object.  It moved from a SSE to a NNW location in the sky while slowly moving upward and quietly wobbling. When I began to observe it it was about 100 to 200 feet above me. Several people came out of the restraunt and saw me looking up so they took the time to watch with me.  We all talked about it while it happend and tried to determine what it was.  It was definitely not a balloon or any craft that I have ever seen before.  When the object obtained a height too high for us to observe it any longer we all talked about wether or not to report it.  All present decided not to report it to the local press or air traffic because we felt they would think we are crazy.  We all parted and went home to bed.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Silent orb moving forward in pulses;2003-08-21 13:00:00;5 minutes;Silent orb moving forward in pulses There was on object that appeared to be egg shaped or maybe football shaped (but more rounded on the ends). It moved silently and fast from west to east. Forward motion seemed to be in pulses.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
