UFO sighting in Bellingham, WA;2007-04-17 23:00:00;15-20 minutes;UFO sighting in Bellingham, WA Tonight I was looking up at the stars in my backyard and saw a very bright star. When I looked more closely at it I noticed several green beams coming out of the bottom of this star. I stared at it for about 5 minutes and relized this wasnt a star. I then woke up my husband to look at it with me. The UFO was far away but was moving a bit back and forth. At one time it started to move forwards towards us and we got scared and went into the house. I could still see it from my window and the green beams were moving and blinking from the UFO. I watched it until it started to almost blink off and on and moved farther away. Then after a few more blinks it just disappeared. I looked for it again all over the sky, but didn't see it, so it was just gone. I'm a normal person 37 years old with a husband and 2 children and never thought twice about UFOs. I am a bit scared to tell you the truth and thought I should tell someone. Thank you;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

A bright green orb seen streaking over Bellingham Washington in a night sky.;2012-11-14 20:00:00;5 seconds;A bright green orb seen streaking over Bellingham Washington in a night sky. A large, bright green orb was observed streaking across the Sky from approximately East Southeast to Northwest over the city of Bellingham.  It was observed for about 5 seconds before it disappeared behind a hill to the north of the city.  It appeared to be between 1000' and 1500' in altitude.

A bright orange/white light traveled across sky, then was gone.  IT WAS NOT A PLANE!;2013-03-07 21:00:00;1.00 minute;A bright orange/white light traveled across sky, then was gone. IT WAS NOT A PLANE! Circle light object below cloud line. traveled west to south west across the sky. I know whaat I saw it wasn't a plane, because it was  a solid orange/white light with no blinking or any other color.  It didn't fade away or go out of sight, it just fanished.  looking at same area after ward there is no other visible lights.  It is above south end of Lake Whatacom which has verry little population.  I have seen similar  lights in this area before, but have never taken action or reported it before.  I cant explain what it was.  It gave me goose pumps.  By the time I told someone else to come look at it, it was gone!;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Silent orange orb floating above trees in Bellingham WA (Fairhaven exit 250/Freeway area) at 12:57am, 03/31/14;2014-03-31 00:57:00;1-3 minutes;Silent orange orb floating above trees in Bellingham WA (Fairhaven exit 250/Freeway area) at 12:57am, 03/31/14 Sighting for: Monday, March 31, 2014, at 12:57am   At 12:57am on the southbound I-5 freeway, about 500 feet before exit 250 in Bellingham WA, there was one medium-sized orange/partial red orb that was floating/hovering above a group of trees that were next to the freeway. The object made no sound. The object made a floating and hovering movement above the trees, probably 50 feet above ground level---so, right above the trees.  This happened for a minute and a half. After the horizontal hovering above the trees, the object turned upwards towards the sky and elevated straight into the sky at a slow pace for about 40-50 seconds.  As the object turned upwards to face the sky, it appeared to look like a triangle for a brief moment (this was nighttime, so it was hard to tell), complete with a reddish light towards the back. I only managed to get one picture of the object. It took me over a minute to get my digital camera set up in my car, and by the time I took the picture, the object was at least 20,000 feet into the mostly cloudy night sky. In the picture, the object looked exactly like a circular orange orb with a slight blur on one side because the object continued to do that very subtle back-and-forth hover that it did when it was hovering horizontally/parallel to the trees. After looking at the picture itself, it’s safe to confirm that it definitely wasn't a satellite, search and rescue helicopter, jet, plane, Chinese lantern, flare, or any other “logical explanation”.  It was a UFO. The object was intriguing, which led me to pull off to the side of the road on the northbound lane to stare at it and send this report a few days later.  The reason I was in the northbound lane was because that was the direction I was headed in my car.  I rolled my window down, gathered my digital camera and tried to set it up as fast as I could to start taking pictures.  It took me about 60-90 seconds to get my camera out and set it up for nighttime flash.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
White circle dot w/markings above a black helicopter.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare.  PD));2015-07-27 13:00:00;unknown;White circle dot w/markings above a black helicopter. My son and I were on a walk and paused on a walking overpass on Alabama Hill.  While we paused to enjoy the view, a black helicopter appeared and we took photos of it.   When we got home and looked at my sons photos, we noticed a bright round dot in the sky above and to the left of the helicopter.   Upon closer inspection, the bright round object has five, maybe six dots on it.  Maybe it’s nothing, but just in case it is an actual ufo, I wanted to submit it. ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare.

I was outside looking at the stars when I saw an extremely bright (like LED light bright) white orb fly across the sky a few hundred feet up with a eastward and downward trajectory.  It was completely silent and it was extremely fast.  Much faster then an airplane or satellite.  I actually braced myself for an impact, which never came.   Did anyone else see this!;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

Multiple aircraft at different heights and distances appear, travel, then disappear.;2017-06-25 21:05:00;10 minutes;multiple aircraft at different heights and distances appear, travel, then disappear. We witnessed one object, a dark circle slowly moving west over the city, then noticed a second at a much higher altitude.  They stopped and hovered for quite some time.  One of the objects lowered toward the others altitude, but was still seemingly much higher in the sky.   Suddenly further distant, 4 other objects came into focus and looked like pinpoints being so far away.  A third closer object appeared and had a blinking light flashing an orangish color.  This object quickly disappeared within a minute, the far distant objects then disappeared from sight as well.   The 2 original objects slowly moved east at this point in a parallel positioning.  Eventually they hovered again for a minute, then slowly seemed to rise up until they were no longer visible.   They were not likely balloons, definitely not planes or helicopters, and outside the range and size of any known drone, to my knowledge.   Very strange experience to witness.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

We were sitting on the deck just after midnight.  Very clear skies, observing stars.  Spotted what appeared to be a satellite, very high up, moving from south to northeast.  Observed for several seconds.   Object suddenly lit up very brightly, a yellow white light, lasted for several seconds then went back to the pale light it was when first sighted and took a sharp turn west and disappeared.   Neither of us have ever seen anything like it.   No we weren't drunk or stoned.   If I didn't think it was quite remarkable,  I wouldn't have bothered to find this website and write this report.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

In fact, it was in approximately the same place in the sky that I saw a similar craft in December of 2013, though this one appeared to be at a higher altitude (or was smaller).  It was alternately hovering, then moving very slowly to the north.  After about 2 minutes, it began to gradually fade in brightness, disappearing within another minute.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
