Three people observe strange light in night sky;2000-07-29 23:30:00;1-2 minutes;Three people observe strange light in night sky It started about 11:30 pm on Saturday July 27th, 2000.  There were 3 of us standing outside on the deck when my husband pointed to the sky and said, LOOK!  We all looked to the sky and saw a pink/red/white light attached to a very faint boomerang shaped object.  The object was hard to see, but the light was very bight.  The object was traveling at a fair pace, faster than an airplane and way faster than a bird and it seemed very high up in the sky (my thumb could cover the entire object).  It traveled straight west, It was moving quickly so I stepped off the deck and followed the object, then the object took a very pin point turn to the north, travel a few seconds in that direction, then another pin point turn the the east.  I followed the object back the east, the object went behind a tree and we never saw it reappear.  All of the witnesses are very upstanding citizens.  Actually, don't think I am crazy, but this is probably the 5th or 6th strange siting my husband and I have seen.  We have moved twice in the past 2 years, and they seem to follow us or something.  We live directly accross from an airport, so we all know this was not an airplane.  There was no noise, no flashing landing lights or anything. We ruled out a bird, because we did not see any flapping of wings.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

My roommate and I were sitting on the porch stargazing (two 20 year-old females).  It was a perfectly clear night.  We were out there for about 40 minutes when suddenly she pointed to an object that came into view.   My first thought was that it was a cloud or a haze of smoke -- looking closer, I realized it was composed of individual objects, maybe 50 or so.  They were dark grey in color, just light enough to be seen against the night sky.  I don't believe they gave off their own light, but rather were reflecting it.  It was flying at about the height and speed of an airplane.   We kept staring at it, trying to figure out what it was -- she suggested a flock of birds, which seemed to fit for a moment, but the longer we looked the more we realized it was definitely not birds.   The objects weren’t moving independently, but as a perfect cohesive unit.  It was flying in a formation, but the objects remained perfectly spaced from one another, to the point where it looked like a grid or a net in the sky.   Then, the objects began to shift and change positions.  It gave the appearance of a morphing, shifting net.   It was 3-dimensional in the way that it moved, and very geometric.  It drifted directly overhead and then slowly out of sight. We didn’t take our eyes off it the entire time.  I have no idea how to properly describe what I saw, the movement was so strange and foreign. Not sure if this is related or not, but about 2 minutes after we saw the object a very loud plane flew by in the same direction.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Bellingham, WA, 3 unknown flying crafts appeared at approximately 6:30 PM Pacific Time. They were red/orange colored.;2015-12-25 06:45:00;3 minutes;Bellingham WA, 3 unknown flying crafts appeared at approximately 6:30 PM Pacific Time. They were red/orange colored. Last night December, 25th, 2015.  I was outside waiting for a cab, and I noticed some strange lights in the sky.  I'm not into the UFO investigating, but there were three of them lined up, by the time I got my phone out two of them just shot away.  No way it's a plane because one went backward. I'm an experienced Paranormal Investigator (Ghost Hunting), but I never investigated UFO's,  I have two pictures which I would be happy to send you.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
