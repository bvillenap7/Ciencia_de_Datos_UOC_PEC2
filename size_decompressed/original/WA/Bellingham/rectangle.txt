I was standing out on the porch having a smoke looking out over the water to the west.  Its a clear night so i can see the stars. Straight out in front of me I saw 3 stars that almost make a strait horisontal line if you conect them and then they vanished. When they came back into view i noticed the starts over my head do the same and i could make out a large rectangle about the size of a football field about 500 feet up or so moving south and was lost over the local terrains hills after about 15 seconds.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
It appeared to be a rectangular docking station seen in Washington State;2012-11-18 21:30:00;3-5 minutes;It appeared to be a rectangular docking station seen in Washington State UFO Sighting - 11/18/2012 - Bellingham, WA - 9:30pm - Top of Yew Street Road Hill Description:  Retangular in shape, 2 columns of three white lights-not blinking-moving in  unison across sky.  The object moved sideways very slowly in a Northwest direction.  It seemed to be gliding the way a balloon would glide.  Then all six white lights got very bright (like high-beams on a car)  and a little red light appeared from the south and approached the object.  The red light seemed to 'dock' inside of the bottom white light on the right hand column.  The object went back to low-beams just before the red light docked and it continued in a northwest direction. Size:  fold a dollar bill in half and hold it at arms length in front of you.   That's how big it appeared to be in the sky.  (very big)  Was about 30 degrees off horizon. Duration: about 3 to 5 minutes before it disappeared behind the trees.  Only my dog and I were present. odd note:  wind had been blowing really hard just before it appeared, then wind was calm.   After it left, the wind blew really hard again.   The object made no noise at all.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
