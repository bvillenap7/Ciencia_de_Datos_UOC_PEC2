sphere? with connected orbiting strobe which changed colors. No sound;1984-08-10 04:30:00;20 seconds;sphere? with connected orbiting strobe which changed colors. No sound Shape was unknown, for I could not see the body of it.  I beleive it was round like a ball.  It had one light, which was connected to this body (which I couldn't see) which orbited around the body in no apparent pattern, and changed colors each time it orbited the body.  The object itself was slowly moving from south-west to northwest, stopped and sort of hovered in one place for about three seconds, then at a very high rate of speed darted in a z shaped pattern-first to the east, then to the southwest (while darting way up in altitude), then west while darting out of sight towards space to the west of my position.  If you can picture a sphere, with a connecting yet orbiting light that changed colors and flashing frequency (the orbiting light part) thats the closest way I can describe it.  When this thing darted, it was un-beleivably fast!  No sound at all either. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Three orange streaks the time of the lunar eclipes.;2003-11-08 18:52:00;a few seconds;Three orange streaks the time of the lunar eclipes. On Nov. 8th, 2003 I went outside to take digital photos of the Lunar eclipes. I first took one photo and reviewed the picture on my camera to see how it looked.  When I saw the photo I thought it was a bad photo, all it showed was this orange streak thru the the sky ( which I didn't see while taking the photo). So I proceed and took three more pictures. In those three last photos I took, the first two had the same orange streaks in them.  But there was three object that appeared to be moving downwards.( again I didn't notice this while taking the photos.)The last photo just shows the eclipes.I noticed that another person made a similar discription the same night,so thats why I checked my photos again and sent this in. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not UFO's.  We suspect photos of street lamps, while the camera is being moved rapidly.  PD));48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

I RAN OUTSIDE TO SEE IF WAS A HELICOPTER, OR SOME OTHER CRAFT. THE AIR WAS SILENT. I WENT BACK INSIDE THEN I HEARD A SONIC BOOM SOUND. A FEW MINUTES LATER THE OWLS ACROSS THE LAKE WERE GOING CRAZY.  SOUNDS LIKE I HAVE NEVER HEARD. I AM NOT A BELIEVER IN UFO'S UNTIL TONIGHT.  MAYBE SOMETHNG GOVERNMENT. ODD. I FELT STRANGE AFTER THE LIGHT EFFECT. ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor.

Three white lights following me on my way home from work at night...;2008-12-10 22:30:00;5 minutes;Three white lights following me on my way home from work at night... I was driving to pick up my daughter after work at night.  She stays very close to the airport, so I am completely used to seeing airplanes flying close overhead and am quite familiar with what an airplane looks like, how they fly, how fast, etc.  I was driving along a road called Airport Dr. where planes normally fly over the road to land on the landing strip nearby. I saw what at first I assumed to be a plane about to land considering it was quite low to the ground.  At first I was worried, because although it still had a good stretch to go before landing, it was lower to the ground than the planes I normally see preparing to land.  I watched it as I drove along, waiting for it to fly overhead to it's assumed destination (the landing strip).  However, it never flew overhead.  There were still a couple other cars on the road at that time.  Then as I continued to drive, eventually I was alone on the roadway, which is when I began to panic, because that's when I realized that the craft seemed to be following me (although not completely obviously).  It was dark, so I couldn't see anything but it's lights, which where 3 white lights in what looked like a triangular formation.  I started to freak out when I realized that the way it was flying was not anything a plane could be capable of.  It was following alongside the road, too close overhead to be a plane but not close enough to get a really good look.   It was also slightly behind me and to the left, so I had to keep turning my head back to see it, than to the road again.  I turned on to Marine Dr. where it continued to follow me.   At this point, I was scared ((deleted)) and going at least 20-30 mph over the speed limit, nearly vearing off the road several times. Finally after what seemed like forever, but considering the distance I will guess was probably around 5 minutes or less, the lights/craft seemed to separate slighty as it sped off very quickly.  As it did this I noticed at least one, possibly more, red light(s) as a glanced as it sped off. Basically the most frightening experience I have ever had, and I never want anything like that to happen to me ever again.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Huge, low flying craft, nearly hits car apparently attempting to land on county road, 5 huge lights;2011-04-18 22:00:00;30 seconds;Huge, low flying craft, nearly hits car apparently attempting to land on county road, 5 huge lights A huge object with 5 super bright lights nearly hit head on while driving.  Object had 3 lights in a row on top, two in a row below this.  Almost appeared to be using road as a landing strip.  Had to pull off the road abruptly thinking it would hit our vehicle.  Stopped to watch, put windows down, no sound. Object appeared to see us watching and disappeared.   We were too shocked to even snap a photo with 2 cell phones on hand.  A friend asked the next day if we saw something weird last night and when we said yes, why?  She reported to us seeing a large low flying object with 5 large, bright lights on it.  The friend was about 3 roads away from where we encountered the object.  It was very frightening especially due to the fact that we thought it was going to fly into the car similar to when a low flying airplane can seem like it can hit a car when driving near an airport.  We were not near an airport and have not seen anything like this before. For a week before and after this incident we have seen massive numbers of strange objects in the night sky that we have not seen before.  Photographs reveal rainbow colors but to the naked eye they vary from white with blinking red/green lights, to amber shades on some others.  They are definitely not stars, some move faster than any aircraft could, some hover but moving slightly, some zigzagging, some left and right, some up and down.  Almost too many to describe.  We took over 500 pictures over 4 days and cannot make sense of any of it.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
While driving, my daugter and I witnessed a brightly lit object move accross the sky in vertical/horizontal movements .;2011-11-29 06:50:00;3 minutes;While driving, my daugter and I witnessed a brightly lit object move accross the sky in vertical/horizontal movements . I was driving my daughter to work at 6:50 am on 11/29/11. My daughter (19 years old) and I (54 years old) were initially drawn to lights in the sky.  The lights were strange because they were exceptionally bright and looked different than normal aircraft lights. It appeared to be a bright light with smaller lights below it, I thought I could see a very small tail, like an aircraft, but the entire shape looked more round, however I could not clearly make out the shape, only the lights were very clear. Of course, I initially thought it was an aircraft just playing tricks with my eyes, but it then started rapidly moving in a horizontal direction and stop, then rapidly in a vertical direction and then stop. I don’t believe, nor have I ever believed in UFO’s, but I was completely baffled, (and a little freaked out) so I turned my vehicle in a way I could keep watching this object. It moved 6-8 times in these incredibly quick vertical/horizontal movements covering a distance that no aircraft could cover and then seem to stop in an instant. Both my daughter and I witnessed this. I eventually had to go by a very large building and when I came out from the building I could not find the object again. All I can say is that I can’t explain what I saw but it is something I won’t soon forget. ((name deleted));48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

I looked West and saw that the object where still coming.  This lasted for a half hour straight, all where going the same way heading East if Bellingham WA.  The objects where too high for me to see shape and size.  I though I saw a satellite at first but I realised  that there was to many going over head and they just kept coming;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
