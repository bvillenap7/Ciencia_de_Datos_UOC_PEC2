I was looking at the sky and saw the Constellation shaped life a W (Cassiopia?)... then I looked to the Southeast and noticed another smaller W in the sky... this surprised me since my last name starts with W I have always taken notice of such patterns... It appeared to have some movement near it, which I assumed was the cloud cover moving... the bottom three of the five stars began to move away from the two top stars... I watched as they slowly moved toward the horizon and then slowly disappeared fading out...;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Drove up to Triangle craft hovering in front/above farmhouse next to county road, at one point was above our car.;2000-07-01 19:00:00;unknown;Drove up to Triangle craft hovering in front/above farmhouse next to county road, at one point was above our car. My memories are fragmented. Best guess it was the summer of 2001 my mother in law was driving my wife and I on a country road. We came around a corner to a clearing where I could see out the right backseat passenger window a triangle craft in front of and above a small farmhouse. I could see spotlights emanating from the craft to the ground. The road curves to the right and we are now driving towards the house, which is still on my right. Next thing I remember is looking up/out the back window and seeing the craft above the car. Each of the corners of the craft was full of multiple changing colors of light. The next thing I remember is yelling to turn the car around which we did. My mother in law, wife and I followed and watched the craft leisurely ascend to the clouds at a 30 degree angle. I was the only one who remembers seeing the craft the entire time. My wife and mother in law were in the front seat talking from what I remember and I never made a sound during the event until the time when I yelled to turn the car around. Up until the time I yelled turn the car around it was evening and dark out.  When we were following/watching the craft ascend it was light out felt like 4pm. This is not the only event that has happened in my life.  As a boy I remember seeing a head looking in my window on several occasions. I remember seeing a glowing light following our car when we were driving back from Eugene, OR to North Bend, OR where I grew up.  The light eventually flew towards and over the car. Again I never mentioned this to anyone until now. This passed 4th of July my wife and I observed several large glowing objects that were intelligently being controlled.  They were visible when the clouds broke. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

It moved across the sky, and pivoted as it moved.  It almost seemed that it went on end with one point pointed up towards the stars and then it disappeared from view. The witnesses were a Warehouse supervisor and a Librarian.  Neither of whom have ever sighted any other unexplainable phenomenon.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Black triangular object moving erratically in sky.;2001-01-10 17:15:00;2-3 mintues;Black triangular object moving erratically in sky. My mother and I were in the car when I noticed a bizarre object moving erratically in the sky. It seemed to have lights at each tip indicating a possible triangular shape-- however, we weren't underneath it so it was hard to tell. What caught our attention though was how it moved: It seemed to be moving faster than a normal airplane. It made large circles in the sky for some odd reason, then it headed northwards and crossed Bellingham Bay, rather fast I might mention, and then we noticed that there was another light up there with it-- by this time though they were pretty far away. That's it. Also, when it was closest to us it appeared to by quite long, and dark black too, it seemed to be larger than a plane should be from that distance.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
V shaped object, 9-11 points (faintly glowing), no sound, fairly low to ground, fast moving.;2002-05-11 21:58:00;15 seconds;V shaped object, 9-11 points (faintly glowing), no sound, fairly low to ground, fast moving. My wife and I were outside at about 9:30 pm enjoying the evening sky ..... looking at stars and watching planes (airliners) pass overhead when my wife spotted something flashing to the west of us about halfway up the sky.  She could not understand why she could not see if anymore and she showed me where she had seen it by the position of 2 bright start to the west. I looked where she had seen the flashing and suddenly saw what I thought could be a satelite ..... suddenly I could see that it was in a triangle shape or v shape like a flock of geese ...... we could see about nine points in a v formation and believe it to be one object because of the way it moved as one. There were no lights no sound. It appeared large and fairly low down and seemed to be picking up light from the city lights or had a faint glow on those points. The points stayed in a rigid formation and moved in a northeasterly direction ..... it was also moving rapidly (faster than birds can fly.) There was no wind of any kind at this time and no thermals. It stayed in a straight line of flight and was gone from our sight in about 10-15 seconds from the first that we had seen it. My wife looked at me and said what the hell was that? ..... I replied, I have no idea. I am a hunter and outdoors person and look in the evening sky on most nights. I have seen meteorites, satelites, planes, but nothing like this. I have watched geese and ducks in formation and have hunted both and again this was nothing like that. One thing ... besides seeing what we saw .... was a total lack of sound as it went over our heads, the rigidness of the formation and the constant speed of the object. The sighting was at around 10 pm Pacific daylight savings time and the night was clear. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be seemingly quite serious-minded and credible.

We were looking for sattelites that nite, using heavens-above as a source for regular sightings.  The sattelite we were looking for was not to appear for a few moments, when all of the sudden do you see that outline.  It was totally black v or triangular, with no visible lighting, exhaust trail or sound moving at very high speed in what appeared to be an orbit.  It was like looking at the iss passing overhead with similar speed and orbit, but huge in size and very stealthy.  My impression was a millitary aircraft at super high altitude but passing over as though it was in low space orbit?  I have seen alot of weird stuff , but never anything like this.   Never would have spotted it if I had not been looking for sats at time.  It looked like a v shaped millitary stealth spacecraft. ??   Never seen it since.  Could only make out entire outline when directly ovrhead for about 4 seconds.  Total sighting time was about 15 seconds.  It would have to be 5 times bigger than iss at that orbit.............no I am not lying or crazy.......... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Near bellis fair. 3 ports on each side. Craft was darker than the night sky. Was standing on the back porch smoking a cigarette, I live 3 stories up.  I was looking out at the stars, and my eyes locked on a moving triangular craft. Darker than the night sky. 3 ports on the side, 3 on the back, and I'm assuming 3 on the side. There was a very very dim orange glow coming from the ports. They where half moon shaped, and concaved. The event took place between 10:20 pm and 10:30. It made no sound, wasn't anymore than 100 feet off the ground, and cruising smoothly along.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Triangular blinking object, low on the horizon, north of Bellingham.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));2011-08-25 22:30:00;30+ minutes;Triangular blinking object, low on the horizon, north of Bellingham. I recently downloaded an app to my phone which tells us when the International Space Station is going to be traveling over our house, so we (me and two teenage sons) were out on the deck watching the ISS to the west when I noticed this bright, blinking light almost directly to the north.   At first we were certain it was an airplane or a helicopter, and stopped watching it to follow the ISS across the sky.  But after the ISS disappeared, we looked again to the north and this object was still there.  It was about 15-20 degrees off the horizon, and completely stationary for the 30-40 minutes that we watched it.  It appeared to be triangular in shape, and there were at least 3-4 lights blinking erratically - red, green, and blue.   I went inside to get my camera (your basic Canon point-and-shoot) and set it to video mode, and ended up getting a pretty good video of it.  In the video it appears to have multiple lights, of different sizes, and possibly some smaller! lights blinking nearby.  My son has a high-def video camera that we tried to use, too, but we couldn't get a good shot of it.   After watching it for about 15 minutes I went inside and woke up my husband, who is a pilot (and who is very skeptical about UFO's).  He came out and took a look through the binoculars, and watched my video.  After watching for several minutes said he had no idea what it was but was sure it was not a star.

12 strobing white lights, moving south to north, that stopped and got smaller until it appeared to be a constellation.;2013-07-12 23:45:00;15 minutes;12 strobing white lights, moving south to north, that stopped and got smaller until it appeared to be a constellation. Around 2345, I walked outside and saw flashing white lights, like a halogen strobe light, going from the south towards the north at a pretty good rate of speed.  The lights appeared to be attached to a triangle shape.  It was hard to gauge their height and size, but they appeared to be pretty high in the sky.  The first batch of 10 moved to the north, then stopped in a formation, and appeared to get smaller, as if they were going straight up the lights were still strobing.  Several moments later, a single light followed and went past the original group, and one more followed after that, disappearing to the north.  The original group of 10 got progressively smaller and eventually just looked like a constellation of stars.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427

My fiance' and myself were just leaving from a friends' place.  We were traveling south at about 10 MPH, as there are speed bumps throughout the complex.  She pointed southeast up into the sky, saying look at those lights!  It took me a few seconds to focus my eyes and see what she was referring to.   There were three red lights in a triangular shape, behind a bunch of very large cedar trees.  It appeared to be extremely large, traveling West.  It was disappearing behind the trees, we tried to speed up to get to a clearing to have a better view but by the time we got past all those trees, it was gone.   We live right near the beach and islands, so I believe while we were looking west but more southwest, it may have been traveling more northwest...  It was unbelievably surreal!!!;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
