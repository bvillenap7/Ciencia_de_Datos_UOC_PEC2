Consistent with behavior of object burning on re-entry;1997-11-14 22:25:00;90 seconds;Summary : consistent with behavior of object burning on re-entry I had a 90 second view of the 14 November phenomena from Bellingham Washington.  From my perspective, it was consistent with the theory of space junk burning on re-entry.  I say this because about 100 initial lights gradualy faded out until only the few brightest remained, and they too faded. Some other observations: * I saw point-lights only, without 2 dimensional shape * Multiple colors, blues, reds, golds, and whites * Two major clusters, the larger one above the smaller * Parallel, straight line path, of all lights, no relative lateral motion between the lights, but some traveled faster than others. My advice to folks who want to label this an object of extraterrestrial origin:  Better make sure your theory holds that the object burned up.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
One bright light similar to shooting star seen going in a S pattern across the sky and then looped around and disappeared.  Aprox 15 mi;1999-06-14 23:45:00;15 minutes;One bright light similar to shooting star seen going in a S pattern across the sky and then looped around and disappeared.  Aprox 15 min later, 3 bright lights race from E to W in V formation but arching (circling) around each other before disappearing. The first siting was seen shooting across the sky from W to E in an S pattern - very bright like a shooting star, but without a tail and much faster than a satellite.  Aprox 15 minutes later, 3 objects of the same intensity shot across the sky from E to W in a V formation right through the big dipper.  The 3 objects were initially traveling in an consistant pattern, then the objects arched around each other - almost making circles around each other, but still going straight W.  They were traveling much too fast to be commercial aircraft at a speed seemingly half that of a shooting star, but with movements much more sophistocated than a shooting star.  Both the events were witnessed by  two of us for several seconds before they disappeared - quickly fading out. Both observers were sober, and both observe the stars on  a regular basis.   We stayed outside for another hour hoping to see a recurrance, or another event.  We did see numerous shooting stars and satellites also that night.  One observer is a flight attendant for a private airline.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
cluster of peanut-brittle colored balls flying in loose formation;2001-11-18 04:30:00;1-2 minutes;cluster of peanut-brittle colored balls flying in loose formation I've delayed reporting this, but if others have seen a similar object, I hope this can be of help. I wrote down the details the day after the sighting, so nothing is lost due to time passed. I opened my sliding glass door to my back porch on the night/morning (11/18/2001) of the Leonid meteor shower at approximately 4:30-4:45 AM. The porch faces south. I was standing in the doorway looking up, catching 3-4 good meteor trails, when I noticed a faint, brownish-amber object (closely resembling the illustration on your site of the May 13, 2001 sighting of a dimly lit craft over Bangalore India) moving NE-SW at a slow rate of speed. It looked like an arrowhead-shaped clump of approx. two dozen or so peanut-brittle colored balls, not 100% solidly in formation, loose, but definitely organized. No sound. Whatever it was, it wasn't self-illuminated, rather it seemed to be dimly reflecting light from the town below. My best guess is that I was looking at a flock of migratory birds flying at night -- is this common this time of year in the Northwest? However, two things prompted me to make this report to you: (1) the object *did* strongly remind me of the object seen over India and (2) I just read on the NUFORC site that someone reported seeing a (what I interpreted as a strikingly) similar object in Seattle (about 90 miles due south of me) the same night, albeit earlier.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Approx. 20:27 hours, under a clear sky and the moon out, I noticed something moving across the sky. It caught my attention in the south;2001-12-23 20:27:00;15-20 seconds;Approx. 20:27 hours, under a clear sky and the moon out, I noticed something moving across the sky. It caught my attention in the southeast, and traveled northward and faded away before it reached the horizon. There were two lights, that eminated rectangular shaped glows, and moved as though they were part of one object. They flew silently across the sky, and had no flashing navigation lights. They appeared to be traveling at about half the distance that satelites orbit the planet, and were very fast.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
series of flare-like fireballs;2002-11-28 06:00:00;1 minute;series of flare-like fireballs A series or formation of fireballs trailing glowing 'embers', moving in a straight line from northwest to southeast. Two leading fireballs, with two outer trailing fireballs and two inner trailing fireballs moving along the line of flight behind the leading fireballs, with a series of approximately eight progressively diminishing fireballs behind them. Probably not higher than 1000 ft. Witness watched the event from the back door facing northwest, and moved into the driveway to watch it disappear in the southeast.

Glowing Objects hovered over Bellingham Washington, then vanished in to the sky;2012-08-11 23:30:00;30 minutes;Glowing Objects hovered over Bellingham Washington, then vanished in to the sky I was looking for meteor showers when I spotted 7 yellow to orange colored orbs glowing just across Bellingham Bay.  I went and got a camera and attempted to take photos of them.  They moved and scattered.  Then they would just vanish into the air.   Then several came up as if out of Canada or the Water in pairs and all hovered just at the north end of Bellingham Bay two of them joined together and the others slowly went out in different directions.  Some would vanish faster than others.   The final one came far east very slowly then just faded away, like a light going out.  This lasted for nearly 30 minutes and went just past midnight.  Very obvious and more unusual than anything I have seen in the sky.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
Bellingam 5 Craft Amber Formation 2000ft est. elevation, no noise.;2013-05-18 20:10:00;30 seconds;Bellingam 5 Craft Amber Formation 2000ft est. elevation, no noise. Stepped out onto back deck of my home in city of Bellihgham.  Noticed the Moon to south.  Turned to East and saw a slow moving amber light(possibly flickering but mostly solid) craft headed in North-South orientation.  I mean slow like a single prop Cessna that is just taking off from the ground, pretty slow. But these craft were fairly high up.  I began to see another craft of a similar character emerge from the heavy cloud layers, just behind the other one, maybe like a 2-3 second count behind the first one.  Then another one, and another one.  All told I counted 5-6 craft, in an F-shaped formation (with the first craft solo), all traveling at the same speed and with no noise whatsoever.  This is why I felt these craft were unusual as the cloud layer is not that high, estimated lower than 2000 feet.  I am basing this elevation on how these clouds were at or near the height of local Chuckanut Mountain (about 1600 feet) which I am familiar with.  Also, the f! light pattern is not a local flight pattern at all, and the military jets that do come into Bellingham are quite loud.  These craft were entirely unique and stealthy.  -C;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
At about 8:30-8:45pm on Christmas Night, I stepped out into my back yard and looked at the western sky.  Through the tall trees.;2015-12-25 20:30:00;2 hours+;At about 8:30pm - 8:45pm on Christmas Night, I stepped out into my back yard and looked at the western sky.  Through the tall trees in our backyard I could see a bright orange orb in the sky.  I went out to the middle of the back yard to get a better view of the sky, unobstructed by trees, and noticed two more bright orange orbs that matched it.  Together they formed a scalene triangle formation - the two lights to the left were basically one above the other, and the one to the right was further away and sort of centered between the other two.  They were not blinking or moving, they were stationary and glowing the exact same color and were brighter than anything else in the sky.  I called for my husband to come out and look at them.  Clouds were coming in, but he was able to witness one of them for a minute or two before it disappeared behind the clouds. I went back in with my family and started talking about what I had seen, and my Mom said she had seen them about two hours earlier when she was coming over to my home.  She lives on a hill about 1.5 miles away, and had clearly seen them, unobstructed, as she drove down the hill on the way to our home.  She described the exact same three stationary orange glowing objects in the exact same place and in the same triangular position in the western sky. I initially thought the objects may have been lanterns, but there is no way they were if she had seen the exact same objects two hours prior to me seeing them. I also wondered if they were planets, but they were the same size, same color and glowing, not twinkling.;48.758048028674;-122.463991039427
