Viewing the eastern sky on a very clear night (9/11/2015) in eastern Lewis County, WA, I observed a bright ball of light about the size of a planet (viewed with the naked eye) with a magnitude of something similar to Venus appear move down about 3° toward the horizon, then disappear.  Five minutes later I observed an illuminated object, which had a yellow pulsing light (no other lights), flying at an across the sky southeast in the direction of where the ball of light disappeared.  The object was silent and I couldn’t hear any engine after it passed over.  The object seemed to be at approximately 20,000 feet altitude.  When the object passed where the ball of light disappeared, another flash caught my peripheral in the southeastern sky approximately 5° below and in front of the object traveling southeast.  I looked southeast in the direction of where the first flash caught my peripheral, and one second later another brighter flash or beam quickly darted past ! the object and looked like it came straight from space towards the ground.  The illuminated pulsing object kept traveling southeast in the direction of Mt. Adams.  I watched it until the mountains blocked my view of it.  It was definitely not a conventional aircraft of any kind, and too low and slow to be a satellite.  The disappearing ball of light was a calming feeling, and the flashes of light shooting towards the object made my hair stand on my arms.  It was a bit of a sinister feeling when the flashes came down from the sky.  The object stayed on course and it never deviated from its southeast direction of travel.  The flying illuminated object did not give me shivers like when those flashes came down.;46.5581;-122.2496
