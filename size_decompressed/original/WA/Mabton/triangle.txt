The two objects flew very slowly and came towards us at SW direction. As it came closer we saw 4 lights on each object. 2 lights in the center closer together and 2 on the edges. It made a very low and quiet rumble as it came closer. After about 10 minutes it turned to a NE direction and saw 3 green lights on the back of both objects and had a flashing light on the right side.;46.2104;-120.0174
