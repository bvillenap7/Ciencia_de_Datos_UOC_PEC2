It disappeared for a fraction of a second and then reappeared on the same path, only to vanish again with bright flash of white light.   I then noticed a fainter, dimmer and less sharp white to red light in the same area as the earlier meteor.  This time it was staying in an almost fixed postition, but moving rapidly back and forth in a space as big as a half moon.  This lasted approximately 15 seconds.   I was driving to Napavine, WA from Kelso, WA to work at 7:00 AM.  The sun was almost up, so the sky was pretty bright.  I was a few hundred yards north of exit 49 on Interstate 5.  Others hit the brakes when the initial meteor like event happened.  Several other cars were parked one the shoulder, with the lights on.   I am a 34 year old male, and a heavy equipment operator on underground utilities projects.;46.2783;-122.9139
