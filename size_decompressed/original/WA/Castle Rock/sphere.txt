As the object flew in front of the Moon I wonder if the lights were a reflection of the Moon, but the objects light quickly faded and I could then see the reflection of the Moon on it.  It appeared to be round and the color looked like un-polished stainless steel.   We live on I-5 and the normal flight path for aircraft is north/south.  The object seemed to be between 3000-5000 ft high, no navigation lights and no sound.   This is also the third strange sighting in a month. ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS was visible from Castle Rock, WA, at 2045 hrs. (local), but it was visible in the extreme western sky, and only for 48 seconds.  PD));46.2783;-122.9139
