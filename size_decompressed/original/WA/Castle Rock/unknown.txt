Late on the night of the 14th of March, I heard a helicopter make several passes over my home.  Something that's not very common where I live in rural WA.  Being a bit of a sky watcher, I go outside each time I hear the helicopter fly overhead.  I can't see anything out of the ordinary with the helicopter, and being that it's night I can't see what model of helicopter it is.  Just the usual distinctive sound of it's rotors and white and red flashing indicator lights.  On the third pass overheard I am able to see that the helicopter seems to be chasing a dim shape.  I can't be certain of the exact shape, but it may have been triangular and it was about the same size or maybe a little bigger than the helicopter.  The only illumination I can see coming from the object is dim white lights at each end.  The lights do not flash like a conventional aircraft's markers, they are constant.  The entire time I can hear the constant sound of as single rotor helicopter, but I can not heard anything distinctive from the object it was chasing.  One final note I can't be sure of the altitude of either craft, but given the sound and relative distances I'm think both the helicopter and the object were no more than about 500 feet or so up.  Probably closer to 300 to 400.  Pretty dang low to the deck, as these things go.  I can't gauge speed but not exceptionally fast.  60 MPH perhaps, probably a bit faster.;46.2783;-122.9139
