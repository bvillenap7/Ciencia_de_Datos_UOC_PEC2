Mt. Rainier appearing & disappearing silverish object/ jet activity;2010-11-03 09:00:00;45 seconds;Mt. Rainier appearing & disappearing silverish object/ jet activity At approximately 9:00 AM on November 3, 2010 I was sitting on my deck enjoying my morning  cigarette.  It was sunny with no clouds.  I was facing Mount Rainier and my home is north of it. I noticed a silvery white object to the east of Mount Rainier.  As it was sunny, with no clouds, I noticed that it was the only thing in the sky.  As I looked at it I noticed that it had a shape somewhat rectangular, though I could not see a clear outline.  It’s possible that it was oval. It was too far away to discern the outline. As I watched, it disappeared for 5 or so seconds and then reappeared a little lower in the sky.  I thought it might be some sort of flat mylar balloon that could not be seen from my vantage point if it turned with the wind. I saw it for another 5 or so seconds before it disappeared a second time.  I watched for another 15 seconds or so and did not see it again, however, I noted a plume from a jet which was traveling west to east at high speed  above and slightly south of Mt. Rainier on a path that looked as though it was headed toward the area of the object I saw. I am submitting this in hopes that it might verify any reports that others might make concerning the object.  I was too far away to see it clearly or provide any detailed descriptions. I don’t think I would have noticed it if there had been a single other cloud in the sky, but cloudless days are unusual in this area and it made it noticeable. I am retired, female, grandmother.  The only other time I have seen anything strange in the skies was when I was around 7 years old  (1958) when I saw a low cigar shaped object!;47.2666;-122.0342
