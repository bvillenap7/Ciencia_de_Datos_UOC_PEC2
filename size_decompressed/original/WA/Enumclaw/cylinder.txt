A break-up in the sky;2002-11-29 06:16:00;6 seconds;A break-up in the sky Hi again, I sent a report yesterday but I have another one today. This morning about 6:16 a.m. I saw a FAST moving object overhead that I thought at first may be a very fast military jet, only it glowed more orange/white and had a small trail behind it.  While I observed it I saw it separate into two pieces and them fizzle out. This object was moving from the northwest to the southeast. It was coming more from the eastern mode than northern and going more to the east than south. Then this a.m. after telling my husband about this mornings sighting he told me that he had heard that the sighting I had YESTERDAY was being dismissed as space debris! He said, this one you had this morning sounds more like space debris than the one you had yesterday.  I AGREE The one from yesterday was toooooooo slow for this kind of explanation and the way it appeared was entirely different than the one this morning! I hope you don't discount yesterday's for that reason! I believe the one from this morning could be more accurately explained as space debris but not the one from yesterday morning!!!;47.2666;-122.0342
