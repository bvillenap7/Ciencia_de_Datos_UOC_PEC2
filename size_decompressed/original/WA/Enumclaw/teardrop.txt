I was driving to my friend's house down a back road in my hometown. The speed limit was 35 Mph and I was getting angry at the driver ahead of me as he slowed down, slower and slower. As he came to a near complete stop, I stopped as well and it caught me eye. It was a craft flying quite low. (Around 1,000 ft) It had two orange lights, one near the top and one near the bottom. It was not quite a teardrop shape. The best I can describe it, (without drawing a picture) is the top of the craft was rounded and it got wider towards the bottom where it appeared to have a more boxed form. One light was at the top and the other was at the bottom. I realized thats what the motorist before me was looking at. The object moved side to side slowely and then began to pick up great speed as it flew to the West. It then streaked off into the distance moving up and Westward. When I say streaked, thats what it really did. The light trail followed it.;47.2666;-122.0342
