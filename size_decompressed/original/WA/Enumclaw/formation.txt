Orange lights sighted hovering in formation and moving slightly above Enumclaw.;2012-08-11 21:45:00;About 10 minutes;Orange lights sighted hovering in formation and moving slightly above Enumclaw. Family was on the way home from a movie, traveling northbound on 264th Avenue when I spotted about twenty orange glowing lights in the sky at about 15-20 degrees from the horizon. I pointed them out in exclamation to the others, and we stopped in a driveway.  There was a woman in the driveway who was walking her dog.  She informed us that the lights had been present for almost five minutes. She theorized that they could have been some sort of parachuting rockets or fireworks over lake Tapps or farther, as the lights were southwest of us.  The lights appeared to be moving upward and away and then dimming one by one.  We turned south onto 264th and then west on 416th St. Strangely enough, we seemed to be actually approaching the formation of lights. I remarked with excitement that we were within a few miles of them.  As we approached their location, however, they seemed to disappear one by one.  By the time we reached the intersection of SE 416th and 244th, the ligh! ts had gone completely, but there were several cars in the vicinity as if the drivers had also attempted to get a better look.  We pulled over where we thought the lights had been above, but nothing remained, and there was no noise.  When we returned to the spot the next day, there was no evidence whatsoever.;47.2666;-122.0342
The front one on left made a 90 degree turn into clouds while others went straight.;2017-11-15 19:00:00;3 minutes;The front one on left made a 90 degree turn into clouds while others went straight. It was raining that night and I was at A 4 way stop behind some cars.  Looked around an saw like seven lights in clearing of clouds.  I went to park car so could take pictures seen four then.  As I watched the first two the one on the left suddenly made A 90 degree turn in to the clouds.  I got some pictures showing four lights white in color nothing blinking like planes have.On the way home I kept looking for them but did see them any more because of rain.;47.2666;-122.0342
