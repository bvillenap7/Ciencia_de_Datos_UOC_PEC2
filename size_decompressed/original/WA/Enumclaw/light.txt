Orange light, approaching Seattle SEATAC airport, no sound.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is commercial pilot.  PD));2014-08-23 22:45:00;3-5 minutes;Orange light, approaching Seattle SEATAC airport, no sound. Sitting in the hot tub as we do every night, we witnessed some unusual lights approaching us.  I am a commercial pilot, we live under the SE to Seatac approach corridor near Seattle WA.  We have commercial aircraft flying over us every night as we sit in our hot tub.   On Friday 8/23/14 at 10:45 p.m., we had just had an airliner fly over our location.  I observed approaching from the east an odd light that was a bit north of the normal approach path.  It passed our house and continued straight toward Seatac airport. The light was a bright orange color, no blinking strobes.  I am very familiar with aircraft lighting, I have been a commercial pilot for 30 years.  This aircraft had neither red nor green lights required on all aircraft, nor were there any strobes.  The altitude was difficult to judge, but I would guess it was similar to the commercial approach altitude of 10-15 thousand feet in our area.  The craft passed a mile or so north of our house, it made no noise.  Observed by both my wife and me.  I had to get out of the hot tub to follow the light towards Seatac.   Somewhere over the Auburn WA area as I was observing the light, it just went black.  Nothing...disappeared.   Total duration of the sighting was approximately 3-5 minutes.   Don’t know what this was, but I do know what it wasn’t, a commercial airliner…;47.2666;-122.0342
Many lights moving in a line across the night sky.  ((Spacelink satellites.));2019-12-25 17:30:00;30 seconds;Many lights moving in a line across the night sky. Multiple lights were seen traveling across the night sky around 17:30.  The lights appeared to be evenly spaced, and all moving in a straight line.  The lights were high in the sky and almost looked like stars, but they were moving.  None of the lights blinked or deviated from the line.;47.2666;-122.0342
