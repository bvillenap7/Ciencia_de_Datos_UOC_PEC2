07-04-12  Saw 5 orange round objects in the sky;2012-07-04 22:30:00;5 minutes;07-04-12  Saw 5 orange round objects in the sky I was standing in my kitchen around 10:30 pm, on July 4th 2012 watching the fireworks when I noticed what I thought were round fireworks moving slowly into the air and I thought they were going to explode into a beautiful light show but they did not.  There were a total of 5 round or circle objects that come up from the east like they were being launched from the ground in front of the full orange moon.  The objects were orange in color and they were in pairs, but there was only a single one in front like a leader, and they didnâ€™t match the firework display their coloring was not as bright like the fireworks.  They slowly drifted in the air like in an arch shape and I was very uneasy because I was not sure if they were coming towards me and what they were going to do.  The objects started to slowly move west above me and then I went outside for a clearer picture they then went south and slowly disappeared.  I was not under the influence of alcohol/ drugs.  I had! never witnessed anything like this ever, I believe what I saw were not to be airplanes because I have never seen them fly in pairs and that close to each other, I also know that the airplanes do not fly in that pattern or direction.;47.2666;-122.0342
