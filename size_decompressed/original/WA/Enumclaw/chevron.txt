I RECENTLY READ YOR ARTICLE IN THE NT.  I'VE SEEN UFO'S ON TWO SEPERATE OCCATIONS, DRIVING FROM LOS VEGAS TO LA AND AT MT RAINEER.;1997-11-11 21:00:00;???????;I RECENTLY READ YOR ARTICLE IN THE NT.  I'VE SEEN UFO'S ON TWO SEPERATE OCCATIONS, DRIVING FROM LOS VEGAS TO LA AND AT MT RAINEER. LOS VEGAS.......IT WAS ABOUT NINE PM AND I WAS TRAVELING WITH ONE OTHER FRIEND WHO WAS DRIVING.  HEADING TO WHAT I THINK WAS THE SOUTH I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT TO THE WEST OR RIGHT OF THE VEHICLE OVER THE MOUTAIN RANGE.  REMAINING STILL FOR A MOMENT THE LIGHT MOVED, PARELEL TO THE GROUND,  QUICKLY TO THE NORTH WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL MILES AND THEN TWICE THE DISTANCE TO THE SOUTH AFTER WHICH IT RETURNED TO WHAT SEEMED TO BE IT'S ORIGINAL LOCATION.  AFTER REMAINING STILL FOR ANOTHER MOMENT THE LIGHT SHOT STRAIGHT AWAY AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE DISTANCE. THE ENTIRE SIGHTING ONLY TOOK A FEW SECONDS.  I WAS SHOCKED, DUMBFOUNDED AND UNABLE TO SPEAK OR LOOK AWAY DURING THE INCIDENT, AFTERWHICH, I WAS ABLE TO MURMER TO THE DRIVER, I JUST SAW A UFO. MT. RAINEER.......A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER THE VEGAS SIGHTING TWO FRIENDS AND I WENT CAMPING AT HUCKLEBERRY CREEK NEAR WASHINGTONS MT. RAINEER NATIONAL PARK.  IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK IN NOVEMBER AND THE TRIP WAS SPONTAINIOUSLY PLANNED BY MY FRIEND ((name deleted)).  MY BEST FRIEND ((name deleted)) HAD AGREED TO JOIN US THOUGH HE WASN'T THE OUTDOOR TYPE.  WHILE I WAS TALKING TO ((name deleted)) ON THE PHONE,  WAITNG TO BE PICKED UP, A YOUNG MAN RODE BY ME IN FRONT OF MY APT.  HE TURNED AROUND,RODE BACK TO ME AND ASKED IF HE COULD USE MY PHONE EXPLAINING THAT HE HAD JUST ESCAPED FROM WESTERN STATE HOSPITAL. SURPRISED AND SLIGHTLY HUMORED, I COULD SEE THE FEAR AND HONESTY IN THE BOYS EYES AND I INVITED HIM IN. HE CALLED HIS MOTHER, WHOM I SPOKE WITH BREIFLY, AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT I WOULD BRING THE BOY TO HER AND SHE WOULD RETURN HIM TO THE HOSPITAL THE FOLLOWING MORNING.  MY FRIENDS ARRIVED TO PICK ME UP AND THE ((name deleted)) RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO TAKE THE BOY TO HIS HOUSE IN SPANAWAY WHICH WAS ON OUR WAY FROM LAKEWOOD TO THE MOUNTAIN.  WE DROPPED THE BOY OFF AND CONTINUED ON OUR WAY. AFTER LEAVING ENUMCLAW, WHICH IS THE LAST TOWN BEFORE YOU HEAD INTO THE FOOTHILLS,  THE ROAD WAS EMPTY. ATER DRIVING IN THE DARKNESS FOR SEVERAL MILES WE NOTICED A FORMATION OF LIGHTS ABOVE US AND MOVING WITH US.  THERE WAS NO SOUND AND THE LIGHTS,  WHICH SEEMED TO BE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US,  FORMED A SIMILAR PATTERN TO THE ONES SEEN IN PHEONIX AND CONTINUED TO TRAVEL ABOVE US.  I REMEMBER LOOKING UP TOWARD THE LIGHTS SEVERAL TIMES AFTERWHICH WE ALL EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF TIME AND MEMORY.  I START HAVING FOGGY MEMORIES AFTER WE HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE CAMP GROUND. I DON'T REMEMBER ARRIVING OR SETTING UP CAMP ONLY TAKING A COUPLE OF DRINKS OF LIQUER WE HAD BROUGHT WITH TO NUMB THE COLD WEATHER AND PASSING OUT.  THE NEXT MORNING WE ALL AWOKE AT THE CRACK OF DAWN.  WHILE LIGHTING THE CAMPFIRE, THREE ARMY HUMMERS STORMED INTO OUR CAMP GROUND AND CAME SKIDDING TO A HAULT. THE MILITARY PERSONEL INSIDE STARED AT US FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN THEY PEELE! D OUT OF THE CAMPGROUND AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAME AND CONTINUED UP THE ROCKY ROAD FOLLOWING HUCKLEBERRY CREEK. ONLY IN RETROSPECT DO I REALIZE THE TIME LOSS OR CONCEIVE WHAT POSSIBLY MIGHT HAVE OCCURED THAT COLD NOVEMBER NIGHT.  BEFORE THESE INCIDENTS I NEVER THOUGHT MUCH OF UFOS EXCEPT WHEN THEY WERE PORTRAYED ON TV OR IN THE MOVIES.  NOW, FIVE YEARS AFTER THE SECOND INCIDENT,  THE HAUNTING FEAR HAS TURNED INTO THE EXCEPANCE OF KNOWING I'VE BEEN BLESSED WITH THE SIGHT AND KNOWLEDE OF WHAT WAS AND WHAT IS TO COME. I AM FILLED WITH THE DESIRE TO ENLIGHTEN EVERYONE WITH THE TRUTH AND ANSWERS THAT HAVE BEEN DISORTED BY PROPAGANDA AND PROGRAMMING, CLOUDING EVERYONES PERCEPTION OF REALITY. PLEASE HELP ME GO PUBLIC AND UNVAIL THE ANSWERS TO THE WORLD!!!!!!! CONTACT ((e-mail address deleted));47.2666;-122.0342
