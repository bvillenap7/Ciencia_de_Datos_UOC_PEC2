There were also one or two other aircraft in the event. While driving North on highway 9 in Snohomish we spotted a light in the night sky somwhere I believe to be over Arlington or the Sound (hard to tell at night). The light pulsed between red and white in a cycle of about twice every second (two red and two white every second). The light also appeared to be centralized, as in it was deffinately not on a wing-tip, or fin. This was also the only light on the object. There was also at leaste one other vehicle in the vicinity, and possibly two. The primary object maintained a rather steady corse, changing direction about once every minute. The secondary vehicle(s) appeared to be following or chasing the primary object, but not maintaining as steady of a corse. The other vehicles had no lights on them except for what appeared to be an engine flame (white). I belive that the aircraft in pursuite were military because one of the engines appeared to fire an afterburner twice during the time that we could maintain visual contact with the objects. All objects appeared to be Northbound and about 10,000 to 20,000 feet up, although this is just a guess.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
Bright orange thing with beams coming out of it changing colors flying across the sky;2012-10-20 23:30:00;5 minutes;bright orange thing with beams coming out of it changing colors flying across the sky So me and my boyfriend were watching movies in his garage and he leaves to go down to his house and then all the sudden I hear, “oh my god! Come here, come here!” so I go down to the garage door where he was and then he points at this really bright orange thing in the sky changing from orange to pink and green, but mostly orange, with bright beams coming out of it. It was flying across the sky faster than a satellite and plane, but wasn't a meteor or star because it was moving fast and got from a point where we could see it and then in about 5 minutes, it went off in a different direction.  Couldn't really tell what the shape was, but it was clearly flying with beams coming out of it across the sky, and very big and bright.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
((HOAX??))  Airplane lighting up the clouds?;2018-05-18 03:00:00;2-3 seconds;Airplane lighting up the clouds? Heard jet/airplane sound then two lights came into view.  They were pretty bright yellow as it was in the clouds on cloudy night.  They were making the clouds light up brightly like a camera flash on and off quickly, and constantly.  The lights did disappear after a few seconds.  I thought holy ((one word deleted)), that's powerful when i saw it in the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source.  Possible hoax??  PD);47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
