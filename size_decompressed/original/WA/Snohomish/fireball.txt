Fireball hovered over downtown Snohomish.;2014-09-15 16:00:00;15 minutes;Fireball hovered over downtown Snohomish. It was a sunny day around four o'clock.  I was crossing the street to enter my vehicle, when I looked up and saw a hovering fireball about 250 feet in the air.   From my perspective, it appeared to be as large as a penny, and simply burned in one spot for about fifteen minutes.  It didn't move, or burn out.  The color was a reddish orange, like embers in a fire.  At that point, I started the car and left.  There were no clouds in the sky, the street was empty, and everything was quiet.   There was no explanation for what it could be, as directional mathematics would have placed it over the outskirts of town. ((NUFORC Note:  If the object was not the Sun, we have no idea what it could have been.  We have received no other reports of the alleged sighting.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
