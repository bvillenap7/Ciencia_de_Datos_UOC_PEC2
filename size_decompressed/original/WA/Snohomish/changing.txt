PD));2016-01-10 20:00:00;6 hours;This all started on the 10th of January, with 5 strange lights in the sky that changed colors and shapes and lasted all night.   The next sighting was on February 6, 2016, and the number of lights are several and move in all directions but can also stay in one place.   I have taken several pictures and now watch them ever night since.  They come out as soon as it get dark.  I am not sure when they leave, since I get cold and tired and go to bed.

Please see my video on YouTube (I can send original too if needed).;2021-07-12 00:53:00;2 min;Please see my video on YouTube (I can send original too if needed). The video is unedited. I don't monetize, but post for friends. It was silent, except for a quiet higher-pitched warble-whir, you can hear it, but it's not a rotor whir.  It was much larger than the video shows, and close less than 500 feet. It made the hair stand up on my arms. I was looking North and it was traveling W to E, at approximately 60 degrees, behind the trees, and moving slowly.  It was a bright golden-colored diamond shape at first, but it changed, got rounder and changed colors as it moved away.  I apologize for the shakiness as I'm not used to filming these things. I use an ISS tracker, a sat tracker and a plane tracker.  It was none of these and WAY too close to be a sat anyway, too silent for a plane, drone or helicopter, no flashing lights.  It was the third fly-by that night as I took my pooch out to go potty, and I caught it as it moved away.  I have a star and planet tracker that I use and it un-calibrated the compass on my phone as I tried to use the a! pp.  It was quite beautiful and much closer than the other two that came by first (from completely different directions).;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
