MY WIFE AND I WERE IN BED WHEN WE HEARD AT FIRST A SOUND LIKE A SEMI WAS DRIVING DOWN THE COUNTRY ROAD WE LIVE ON, THEN THE SOUND GOT LOUDER SO I THOUGHT IT MUST BE TWO SEMI'S, HOWEVER THE SOUND KEPT GETTING LOUDER AND AT ONE POINT I THOUGHT IT MUST BE SOME ARMY CONVOY OR SOMETHING, THE SOUND GOT LOUDER AND I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND I SAW NO HEADLIGHTS, THE SOUND GOT SO LOUD THAT I FELT THE HOUSE SHAKE.  THE SOUND WAS LIKE IT WAS THROBBING. IT TOOK MAYBE 40 SECONDS FOR THE SOUND TO COME TO IT'S LOUDEST PEAK LEVEL BUT ONLY 5 SECONDS FOR IT TO FADE OUT. MY WIFE THOUGHT IT WAS A HELICOPTER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.  WOULD A HELICOPTER FLY THAT LOW IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH NO LIGHTS AT 3AM?  WHATEVER IT WAS IT SOUNDED AS IF IT HOVERED OVER OUR HOUSE AND THEN LEFT.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
There was a bright flourescent green light in the northeastern sky with no definite shape that had streaks through the haze.;2000-10-05 00:05:00;15-20 minutes;There was a bright flourescent green light in the northeastern sky with no definite shape that had streaks through the haze. My friend and I were sitting on her back porch talking, we had just finished moving furniture around her house.   She is a single mom who works part time at a restaurant and I am a full time education student.  Looking to the northwest, we saw a flourescent green light that then slowly faded and appeared in the northeast and slowly moved in a westerly direction.  It then moved east again.  It was an extremely bright light, and there was a haze around the brightest part of the light with streaks going through it.  There was NO definite shape. It slowly faded again, then came back, but not as bright.   It's very difficult to describe what we saw in words!  It lasted about 15-20 minutes, and once it slowly faded out, it didn't come back again.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
tanto shaped long object with a matching smaller section at 2/3 rd the length on the bottom.;2006-09-01 21:00:00;1.5 to 2,5 seconds;tanto shaped long object with a matching smaller section at 2/3 rd the length on the bottom. I was using a my 114mm reflector telescope observing a nearly 1/2 moon at around 9:00 p.m. on Sept. 1st, 2006.  I was using a 3x barlow with a 25mm wide angle lens. The moon was very bright and the sky was totally clear.  As I was observing the moon a tanto shaped long object cruised across the field of vision!  I have no idea how big or long it was and also 2/3rds down the shape was an exact smaller tanto shaped part of the craft that appeared to be attached on the underside (my telescope shows objects actually upside down so the smaller section was on top, yet in reality was on the bottom side, hope this makes sense!).  I don't know if anyone else reported this, I don't know if this is a black project experimental craft, or UFO, but what struck me was the 45 degree angle of the front part of these two front sections, and a slightly rounded rear end. It was headed in a westerly direction.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
5 Orange/Red balls of light moved north to south over Snohomish WA then disappeared.;2013-07-04 22:30:00;10 minutes;5 Orange/Red balls of light moved north to south over Snohomish WA then disappeared. On July 4th 2013 at approximately 22:30 my wife two friends and I witnessed a total of 5 orange/red balls of light move across the sky. These lights appear to be similar to other reports on NUFORC, (6/15/2013, 6/29/2013). All of the lights seemed to originate from the north, the last, a little more to the northeast approximately 30deg overhead.  They moved in a southerly direction at a constant speed, one seemed to hover for a few seconds directly overhead then continued on.  The lights appeared to be traveling at different altitudes, the third one much lower than the others.  At first we thought they were helicopters but there was no sound.  They all disappeared in the same general area approximately 50deg overhead. Duration  ~10.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
