Over hours of continuous blinking light in the sky, occasionally moving rapidly, as if circling.;2003-01-09 21:00:00;9 hours;Over hours of continuous blinking light in the sky, occasionally moving rapidly, as if circling. I pointed out to my wife a strange light in the sky about 9:00 PM last night, roughly to the N-NW of my house, very high and distant. It was twinkling like a helicopter or an airplane at night, however it would move side to side, then up and down quite rapidly, and at other times was quite stationary. We dicided it must be a helicopter seen from a great distance, circling as if searching. At no time did it vary from the same general spot in the sky, it simply would change direction, noticably, therefore NOT a star. Must to my surprise, I went out again after sleeping until about 3:00 AM PST, and IT WAS STILL THERE, with the same behavior. It is now almost 6:00 AM, and it is still doing the same thing! It has not changed from the same general direction in the sky, which you would expect if it was a star, (over time with the Earth revolving) but is still sometimes stationery and at other times, rapidly moving side to side, and occasionally slightly up and down. This has now been approximately 9 hours, which would be quite strange for a helicopter to be doing this for so long! I would like to know if others have noticed this strange behavior?;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
One large bright hovering twinkling light that separated into three dimmer lights that twinkle and then extinguished one by one.;2007-01-07 20:05:00;6 Minutes;One large bright hovering twinkling light that separated into three dimmer lights that twinkle and then extinguished one by one. I first saw one very bright slowly twinkling multicolored light as I was driving in my car.  It looked larger, brighter and slower than a jet airliner approaching.  I kept watching for it as I drove home.  By the time I got near home I could see that it had split into three unicolor lights hovering over the city staggered at varying elevations.  I pulled up to the house and ran in and got my wife to show her. The neighbor was also pulling up and she saw it as well. My young daughter may have seen them as well. At this point they were all amber colored lights with a slow rotating twinkle.  The three lights were hovering and slowing moving.  They were maybe 500 to 1000 feet in elevation, staggered at elevations maybe 200 feet apart.  The two higher lights were rising in elevation.  The top light started to fade and flutter out.  Then the middle light faded out and then the bottom light started to twinkle slightly more brightly and then started to flutter out finally dissapearing.  The air was quite cold at about 18 degrees F. The sky was fairly clear with stars being visible and there was a slight haze in the air.  The city light reflecting on the haze was enough that I think that I would have been able to see the shadow of an object once the lights went out, but the lights appeared to extinguish and then dissapear with no trace of an object.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
Bright object observed over wooded park area near Clearview, WA in early morning;2008-06-17 02:00:00;20 minutes;Bright object observed over wooded park area near Clearview, WA in early morning At approximately 02:00 hours on 06/17/2008 I observed a single-point light from my bedroom window at ((address deleted))  Snohomish, WA 98296. My second-story bedroom window faces directly south. The light was white and I estimated its position to be around latitude 47.862139 longitude -122.13522. The object was about 5 degrees above the treeline and I estimate itâ€™s altitude as 2000 or less. I opened my window and could hear no sound from the object and it was otherwise silent outside. The object climbed from east to west at a slow pace, then would abruptly change speed and direction. Object did not appear to move in a manner consistent with a fixed-wing or rotor aircraft. This lasted for about 20 minutes and I fell asleep before seeing what happened to the object.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
Two lights in formation over the Snohomish Valley.;2008-12-28 21:30:00;ongoing;Two lights in formation over the Snohomish Valley. My husband and I saw two objects that looked like bright lights, one flying above the other.  They were coming across the Snohomish Valley towards us (we live on the ridge above the valley).  They stopped.  And they hovered for about 5 minutes.  They went backwards, but stayed in formation.   Then a few minutes later, the large one on top went south and upward and the smaller one went north and downward.  They disappeared then reappeared again and again in various places in the sky. Their light grew bright and then it got dim and disappeared.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
Bright orange light hovered right over our house with no noise.;2009-07-04 21:30:00;2 minute;Bright orange light hovered right over our house with no noise. July 29, 2009. Seen in Snohomish Washington USA. Seen for about two minutes. Seen by my father and I.  Light. Very bright light. Orange light. Lasted about 2 minutes when it started to dim then went completely black then shot off in to space. Traveling much faster than any airplane. No noise whatsoever. It was about right above our house.  By Jimmy Holtz  The object was close enough to here a motor but there was no sound.  To describe the object is hard because the appearance was so strange that was unlike I have ever seen before.

very fast white light seen, no noise present;2011-02-19 19:30:00;5 secs;very fast white light seen, no noise present My husband and I went out to share a cigarette.  While my husband was playing with our dog, I looked up at the sky and noticed a bright light behind our house and thought, That looks odd, then suddenly it took off.  As it was flying away I was yelling at my husband Oh my god, are you seeing that?  He turned around and said, What? and it was gone.   It flew towards the ground and Southeast into Everett, Wa.  It was a large bright round light and made no noise.  It was extremely fast and it was not a shooting star, nor a standard aircraft.  We live near the small airport in Snohomish, WA, so we see and hear airplanes all the time.  A few minutes after seeing the bright light, a small aircraft flew over and was at a much higher altitude.  I was excited and slightly nervous after seeing this, as it was rather close to our home. On the same day, around 4:30pm in the afternoon we were driving from Bellingham, Wa.  As we were getting into Snohomish, Wa, near the Ebey Slough I noticed an object in the sky.  It was not moving and as I was telling my husband, Look!  I think there is a UFO in the sky and it blinked out.  He couldn't really stare at the sky as he was driving.  There were no clouds in the sky, so I kept looking as we were driving on the road, but saw nothing.. not even an aircraft.  Not sure if they're both related, but wanted to add this to see if anyone out there saw the same thing I did.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
Multiple Bright Orange High Altitude Lights Seen Moving in Incredible Ways in Early Morning Night Sky.;2013-10-07 06:30:00;15 minutes;Multiple Bright Orange High Altitude Lights Seen Moving in Incredible Ways in Early Morning Night Sky. 	At 6:30 am on Sunday October 6th, 2013, my Girlfriend and I had just returned home in Snohomish from visiting friends in Seattle, WA.  It was a beautiful and perfectly clear night sky just before sunrise and I took notice of the familiar constellations above me.   Within seconds, I noticed that a few of the lights were extra bright looking and even looked a bit orange in color.  I focused on the brightest one directly above me and I could see that it was moving very slowly and steadily across the sky.  I got my Girlfriend's attention and she started watching with me.  At this point I thought it could be a an airplane at high altitude or a satellite but I continued to follow it with my eyes.  Not a second later, it accelerated to at least ten times it's speed and shot across the sky.  Without slowing down, it then took a seemingly impossible right angle turn.  The glowing orange object then slowed down and returned back in the direction it came from and then took off! at vertical angle directly out into outer space.  We followed it for twenty seconds or so until its light faded completely.  	We then scanned the sky for other bright star-like lights and found that there were at least three more visible that were behaving in the same way.  They were moving about the sky in ways that were not possible by regular known aircraft and were moving at incredible speeds.  They were also accelerating and changing direction in ways that I have never seen. It was quite clear that they were guided by intelligence.  This went on for about twenty minutes until the Sun started rising and the lights faded into the blue morning sky.  All four of the observed UFOs were at seemingly high altitudes and were witnessed very clearly by both myself and my Girlfriend.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
Blue cloud like light with orb in it..;2017-04-01 20:30:00;Seconds;Blue cloud like light with orb in it.. Took the dog out to do her business, and there was a *very* bright phthalo/light blue light (very bright and iridescent) outside on the other side of the trees, just in front of the ridgeline.   At first I thought it was a close cloud, but it is very dark and full overcast out there tonight and it didn't move like a cloud.  It was moving very quickly from west to east, and it was undulating and swirling, as it went like it was wrapping itself up.  There was a bright white orb I could see inside of it for a short time.   You can see that my dog went up to the fence where the light is.  She was looking around. Not sure if she could sense it too or just saw it or what.  I guess that's the best way I can describe it.   The first time I saw something in the sky I could not identify in my life was August of last year.  I was so shocked, I didn't grab the camera.  This time I did grab it, even though it passed very quickly, so I have pics for you that I'm sending.  Taken with Samsung Note 5.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857

Two stationary dots in the vicinity of the moon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Planets, Venus and Jupiter??  PD));2019-01-30 07:10:00;10 minutes now;Two stationary dots in the vicinity of the moon. Hello Peter,  I've heard you on Rense several times. 7:10 AM, I am in Snohomish.  Looking at the waning crescent moon in the south-southeastern sky, at 1-1/2 fingerwidths out at the 7 o'clock position is a dim dot, I presume Venus.  Three fingers east of this dim dot is a much brighter dot, stationary now for at least 15 minutes.  Possibly an unusual planetary configuration...? --I tried taking a photo with my cellphone, and the bright dot is visible in it. There is also in the photo a chemtrail running near the bright dot and a second about equally bright dot near the first one, neither of which is visible to the naked eye. --7:19 now, and both dim Venus and the bright dot are still visible in the dawn light. --7:26, the bright dot is still visible.  Could it be that the bright dot is Venus and it just happens to be extraordinarily close and/or bright, and the dimmer visible dot is another planet which just happens to be by coincidence very close to ! the moon?

At least 45 single lights on the same flight path over WA state.

There were so many, we lost count. If we had only seen one light, we would have thought it was a satellite due to the height and speed.  They kept coming, following each other, for approximately 15 minutes.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
