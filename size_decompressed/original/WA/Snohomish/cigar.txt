Cigar and slowly spinning triangle in daylight.;2016-08-16 17:00:00;2 minutes;Cigar and Slowly spinning Triangle in daylight Travelling home from work.  Husband driving.  Saw cigar-shaped object silvery-white with two vertical red bands on each end.  Next to the cigar was a smaller white triangle slowly spinning, also white/silvery.  Too far to see details.   Watched as triangle continued to spin, got smaller and disappeared.  Cigar-shaped object went behind houses.  Not sure what they were.  This is the first time I've ever seen anything I couldn't identify.  It's the slowly spinning triangle that makes the least amount of sense.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
