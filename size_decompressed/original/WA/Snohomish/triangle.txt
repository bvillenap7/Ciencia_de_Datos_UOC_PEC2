Triangle of three lights in the night sky, stationary but rotating like a wheel.;1985-06-01 22:00:00;1 hour or so;Triangle of three lights in the night sky, stationary but rotating like a wheel. I heard you on 97.3 FM tonight and wanted to see pictures of the car with the dents on the passenger side.  I came across an image of another report of 3 lights in a triangle shape very high in the sky.  I immediately recognized these lights.  When I was young, I used to lay in my front yard and look at the sky at night.  Very often I would see these exact objects.  They remained stationary, but slowly rotated (like a wheel).  I used to go out and look at them and wonder what they were.  My wife grew up only a few blocks away and remembers seeing the same thing.

Triangle shaped object hovering above farmland;2000-01-12 18:20:00;2 minutes;Triangle shaped object hovering above farmland AS me and my friend were headed to youth group I looked out the passenger side I saw a triangle shaped object with three lights on each point and a bright red light in the middle.  It appeared to be hovering which could have just been because of the movement of the vehicle however there was no noise.  It appeared to change its position as we would only see 2 white lights then all of them then only 2 again as if it was turning. Because of the movement of the vehicle it soon dissapeared behind some trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted anonymously.

3 Triangular shaped crafts were seen hovering over the tree tops, under a 1st Phase Moon, then disappearing after 60 seconds.;2016-11-07 18:55:00;60 seconds;3 Triangular shaped crafts were seen hovering over the tree tops, under a 1st Phase Moon, then disappearing after 60 seconds. Date:  November 7, 2016.   Approximate Time:  Between 6:55 and 7:00 pm   Location: Snohomish, WA  Latitude and Longitude:  Will be submitted in hardcopy report  Night Sky:  Clear with a First Phase Moon    MY IMPRESSION: I was driving my grandchildren home on November 7, 2016, approximately 7:00 pm.  As I turned onto their street, I was mesmerized and held captive by what I saw and told the children to look up in the sky.  My 8 year old grandson exclaimed, “Nonna, what is that?”  I said it looks like some kind of UFO craft?   I slowed the car down and then stopped to view and it just seemed to drop or disappear below the tree line.   I quickly put the car in reverse to see if my position was the reason I could no longer see, but the objects were gone, no lights could be seen between the trees or in the night sky anywhere ~ they disappeared as quickly as they appeared.  As I pulled into my son’s driveway I told my grandson to go get his father while I unpacked the car all the while my 5 year old granddaughter was crying as she was frightened.  When my son came out of the house and we both heard and saw a very loud helicopter across the Valley in the vicinity of Harvey Air Field. It took a couple of days to process everything, but I did write everything down and attempted a crude drawing.  I knew I had to investigate further before submitting a report and contacted Harvey Air Field to have them check their Manifest to see if any helicopters were in the air around 7:00 pm on November 7th.  There were no helicopters at that time in the air - DEAD END. Later that day, I learned that there was in fact a helicopter in that vicinity and that they were doing Military Maneuvers. RECONSTRUCTING THE SIGHTING In an attempt now to reconstruct the shape and dimension of the crafts (I’ll  describe as objects for the time being), I first drew a large triangle and then at each of the three points I drew triangles - three equilateral as well as equidistant shaped triangles. Each triangular object was lit up with bright white lights that appeared to run along vertical lines moving upward to the top of the triangle which had pink or red lights at the base. The night sky was clear and the objects were illuminated by an unusually bright half moon.  Later, I looked up to see if there was in fact a half moon and learned it was a First Quarter Moon. There was no sound whatsoever and the objects seemed very close.  I don’t have the ability or science background to be able to report the exact size of the objects in relation to the planets and to the moon, but I know without a shadow of a doubt that what I saw were not planets or stars. When one sees planets and stars in the night sky they appear as tiny white dots, but what we saw were distinct objects ‘up close and personal’  as they say, clearly illuminated by the brightly lit moon. FINAL IMPRESSION:  The entire occurrence lasted no more than a minute, but something else occurred that has taken time for me to process as it defies logic.  As the objects seemed to drop below the tree line and disappear, it was at this point that I briefly took my eyes off the area to put my car in reverse and that is when I had a most unusual experience when I turned back around.  I will attempt to describe. I had the impression that the objects had not disappeared but were closer, or becoming larger, and passing overhead as I could see that the center area between the three triangular points was black, darker than the night sky, and all the lights were either dimmed or turned off ~ but I could see an outline.  It  was at this point that I knew that the triangular objects I saw were not three separate objects, but one large CRAFT.   It was gone with a blink of an eye, certainly a subjective experience and difficult to describe, but it was nonetheless my experience. ARTIST RENDERING I have an artist's drawing which I would like to submit, but I'm  unable to cut n' paste the digital picture into this document.  Please advise what formatting I should use.

The light formation quickly headed south east at a very high speed.  I would say the triangle was about the size of a baseball field.
