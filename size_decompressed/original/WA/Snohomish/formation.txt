Large object seen traveling northeast at a slow rate of speed approximately 300-500 feet above the ground and 250 to 300 yards from obs;1997-11-14 21:10:00;10 seconds;Summary : Large object seen traveling northeast at a slow rate of speed approximately 300-500 feet above the ground and 250 to 300 yards from observer.  Object was rectangular, and was about the size of a football field.  Appeared to be translucent with reddish/orange lights of different intensity surrounding the perimeter, however, the dark superstructure could be seen, outlined by the lights.  4 observers saw the object, 2 of which pursued in a car but could never regain sight.  3 observers later made schetches of the object without the others input.  All were strikenly similar. UFO sighting November 14th, 1997.  XXXXX 86th St. S.E. Snohomish,  Wa. 98290. 9:10 P.M. My wife ((deleted)) was in the hot tub outside at the time and my four sons and myself were inside the house.  My wife appeared at the front door very excited/frantic calling for us to come outside.  When I got outside she pointed to the northeast and sad in a load voice Whats that!!  I didn't answer her at the time because I was in awe of what I was seeing.  My 12 year old son ((Name deleted)) and my 16 year old son ((Name deleted)) had also come outside with me and were witness to this event as well.  My wife was viewing this object for about 1 to 2 minutes before she summond me.  During this time the object looked very different.  She described it a appearing as a white ball with flames or trails of sparks shouting out behind it.  When I first saw it the object was travelling northeast at a slow rate of speed approximately 300 to 500 feet above the ground.  The object was large (about the size of a football field) and appeared to be translucent.  Weather at the time was extremely clear with the tempe! rature between 35-40F.  Multiple lights surrounded the perimeter (reddish/orange) and varied in intensity.  The dark outline of the superstructure could be seen outlined by the lights.  Object was 200-250 yards from our position of observation.  No sound eminated from the object and there was no other noise (cars, planes, stereos, etc.) at the time.  It was very quiet.  Object was pursued in a vehicle but sighting was not regained.  Various news reports speculated that the sighting was due to Leonid Meteor shower or a Russion spacecraft reentering earths atmosphere.  Meteors do not fly subsonically in formation horizontally for 10 seconds.  It was not that.  While there was a Russian spacecraft that did reenter the earths atmosphere and was seen by many people on the west coast at about this time, the reckage supposedly ended up in the Pacific ocean.  The object we saw was traveling northeast,  had a very clear symmetry/structure and was close enough to us for us to  want to p! ursue it.  I have read many books on astronomy and the UFO phenomenon and have worked at The ((Name deleted)) Company for 18 years as a business analyst.  This sighting did not have anything to do with the Leonid meteor shower, Russian space junk or planes flying in formation!;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857

At least 35 single lights on the same staggered flight path over WA state (not a satellite link)  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-07 21:00:00;15 minutes;At least 35 single lights on the same staggered flight path over WA state (not a satellite link) We saw at least 35 lights pass over us on the same flight path. It was not a satellite link since some lights were staggered (not in a perfect line) and they were spaced too far apart! The passing of all the lights took 15-20 minutes.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
