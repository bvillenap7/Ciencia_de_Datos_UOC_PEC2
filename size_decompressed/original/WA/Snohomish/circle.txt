Tiny, white dots;2002-07-12 17:00:00;45 seconds to 1 minute;Tiny, white dots I was at my grandparents for the afternoon, waiting for my mother to come an pick me up. Today. It was a bright, and sunny day. The skies were blue, and beautiful. I was staring out the window, because I was bored. Like always.  As I stared out the window, I started to concentrate really, really hard on the sky. The more I concentrated on the blue skies, the clearer they became. I don't know if I was imagining it, but I saw hundreds, maybe thousands of these cirlular...well...dots. I don't know how else to explain what they looked like. But they were teeny, tiny, little white dots. They were wizzing around and going everywhere. I told my dad, and he gave me the link to this site to write to you.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857

Ther;2002-09-21 07:30:00;7 minutes;Driving down the road I pulled over because I was astonished of these three lighted orbs acting in a way I have never seen before. There were other witnesses, but people were so enthralled with what they saw I don't know if they took their own photos. I snapped two. I saw these objects at least 3 times this evening on 09-21-2020. not sure what they are or were, but obviously under intelligent control.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857

two witness large brilliant ring of lights over Snohomish Washington;2006-08-05 05:00:00;45 min;two witness large brilliant ring of lights over Snohomish Washington First noticed bright object in sky.  It was the only object visible, remainder of sky was a consistent morning grey.  I observed it move very slowly. It was extremely large.  I went and awakened wife.  Together we watched it move for several minutes, when it became obvious it was not a plane, far too large, or a planet, movement lateral and then vertical to line of vision we went and got binoculars.  What a shock.  It was a huge circular shape with lights evenly spaced aroung entire circle and appeared sky grey inside circle.  At one point on top of circle  was a brilliant light ( what we were observing with naked eye) that almost gave the appearance of a diamond ring with the light being the diamond.  We took turns observing this for over half an hour. Occasionally the huge light seemed to change position sweeping over the surface of the circle. We also got a compass and lined it up with the object it was just a hair east of the northeast marker at about 60 degrees. Toward the end of the sighting it appeared to either break into two like objects or be joined by another larger but lilke object approachin from behind the first. It vanished quickly moving away from our vision.  Most amazing was its size---it had to be incredibly large!!!!!!!!!!!!  There may hve been some magnetic disturbance, we had a very difficult time stabalizing our compass.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
