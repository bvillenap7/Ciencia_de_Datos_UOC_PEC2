White Sphere seen in sky, near soccer fields.;2009-07-18 15:00:00;5 min.;White Sphere seen in sky, near soccer fields. My family and I went to the Snohomish soccer fields to watch my Aunt play soccer. Everyone camps around the perimeter of the soccer fields because the games are a Three day event.We were sitting at our campsite, watching skydivers land in the next field. My Cousin noticed a white sphere far above the skydivers. All of us at our campsite watched this white sphere fall like it was a Skydiver, or a balloon. The white sphere at some point no longer was falling but was drifting away from us. Then The sphere suddenly shot up and out of site through a cloud.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
Bright ink-spot in the sky. such as other postings.;2009-07-29 22:30:00;1 minute;Bright ink-spot in the sky. such as other postings. July 29, 2009. Seen in Snohomish, Washington, USA.  Seen for about one minute. Seen by my father and I. Sphere shape. Very bright light.  Traveling much faster than any airplane.  Seen two times. We saw this one time on the 4th of July 2009.  Same exact thing one the 4th.  No noise whatsoever with both. Both times they were about right above our house.  After the one today (July 29, 2009) there were about five more airplanes chasing it.   By ((name #1 deleted))   The object was close enough to here a motor but there was no sound.  To describe the object is hard because the appearance was so strange that was unlike I have ever seen before.   By ((name #2 deleted));47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
5-6 Orange orbs NO noise/sound, flying in sync;2020-07-25 01:00:00;5-7 minutes;5-6 Orange orbs NO noise/sound, flying in sync While sitting in my car visiting with my sister, I looked up to the dark,clear, night sky and saw 2-3 large, BRIGHT Orange orbs, that initially I thought to be Chinese lanterns, but as I continued to stare, they were not behaving like lanterns or drones, and I pointed them out to my sister, and we got excited, and out of the car to get a better look, at which time she exclaimed-’GRAB our phones and take photos”, so we did. I took a few and then also a 2 minute video. WE were in AWE, as the way they behaved and looked, was of NOTHING of this world or technology. They were intensely orange and almost seemed to hover at first, and looked to be in a sort of formation/relation to each other, then went from hover to forward motion, in sync, maintaining perfect distance from each other. WE noticed NO NOISE or sound from them, and it was a VERY QUIET evening. One seemed to disappear, then THREE more appeared! We watched them fly from the north towards the south, in the Eastern view of the skyline, and then out of sight or disappeared, we couldn’t tell? This took probably a period of about 5-7 mins total, as my video was two minutes long etc...wishing of course, it was of BETTER quality, as I was so excited, and tried to zoom in on them a couple of times.;47.8860833333334;-122.074432142857
