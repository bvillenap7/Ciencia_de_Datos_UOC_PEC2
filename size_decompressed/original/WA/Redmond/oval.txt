I was driving south on Willows Road Toward Redmond/Bellevue when I saw a disk in the sky over what looked like Redmond.  It was a Blue/Chrome color. It was stationary for a minute then it seemed to either turn or change shape as it started to get darker, almost like a shadow going over it.   It then started fading and just disappeared.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
Bright Oval flying object seen in the distance, with the help of binoculars;2015-09-11 06:00:00;15 minutes;Bright Oval flying object seen in the distance, with the help of binoculars I went outside at about 6 am to take my dogs on emergency potty break.  We live in the woods, and it was still very dark. I looked up at the sky and saw one very bright “star”.  I realized that the sky was overcast and no other stars were visible,  I then wondered if perhaps it a planet.  I didn’t think it was an airplane because of its height and brightness, and the fact that it did not appear to be moving at all.  I observed it for a few moments, and then thought I detected a pulsing quality about it, which seemed odd.  I went inside to grab some binoculars, and when I returned it was still in the same spot.  I didn’t think that I would be able to see anything, but I was able to see that it was actually a disk or oval shaped flying object.  I felt like I was viewing the bottom part of it, and could see an inner ring of chasing lights, they were brightly colored.  I looked several times to make sure it was in the same spot.  I thought it would disappear, but I watched for about 5 minutes.  I then decided to wake up my husband and have him take a look.  He saw the same thing.  I watched for a little while longer, than noticed that it seemed to be moving slowly further away, and eventually the morning fog obscured it all together.  It was too dark and far to photograph. I would not have noticed it on a clearer night. I don’t know what to think.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
