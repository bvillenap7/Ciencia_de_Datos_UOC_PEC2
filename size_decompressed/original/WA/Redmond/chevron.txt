Chevron shaped object glowed a bright, shimmering gold color. Object moved from east to west at a very rapid rate before disappearing behind trees. Object did not emerge from trees. No noise was heard. Altitude is unknown. All three people saw the same thing, ie. gold shimmering shape moving very rapidly. Clear night sky with no fog, haze, etc.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
Large V-shaped craft seen cruising night sky in Redmond, WA.;2016-11-08 00:00:00;3-4 seconds;Large V shaped craft seen cruising night sky in Redmond WA I was working at the AT&T building in Redmond, WA, doing a demo job.  I and a colleague took debris outside to dump into the truck.  I had to reach up to move a piece of debris, when at that moment a huge V-shaped aircraft flew over my head.  The time was midnight and the sky was clear aside from light fog.  The aircraft was not flying too fast but was pretty low.  I could near no noise and could see either brown circular spots or lights on both sides of the craft though the spots or lights werent spaced evenly.  It was huge in size and its crazy but Im almost sure I could see through it.... as if it were slightly transparent.  I could see the fog moving as it cruised by.  It was almost as if it were gliding instead of flying.  It speed and direction were both constant and steady.  And just in matter of seconds vanished into the night sky.  This was the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  It was flying sooo low and I could see it so well.  Right over the buildings is the way it looked and it was big!;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
Shallow angle chevron wing ufo sighting;2019-10-19 22:15:00;2 Minutes;Shallow angle chevron wing ufo sighting Looking up in the sky we saw a shape silently moving north through the sky below the cloud cover. It seemed straight but there appeared to be a shallow angle to it at times so I would characterize it as a shallow chevron.  It was a uniform color and was dimly colored as though it was reflecting some moonlight, perhaps a mid to dark gray color.  It was utterly silent and moving at a consistent bearing and speed.  There were no lights on it whatsoever. It was very difficult to spot and we lost track of it after a bit over a minute.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
