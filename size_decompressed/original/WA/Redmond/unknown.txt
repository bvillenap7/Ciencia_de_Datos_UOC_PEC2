redmond washington sighting 1995;1995-08-16 23:30:00;5 minutes;redmond washington sighting 1995 in one evening in the summer of 1995, when i was living in redmond, washington i was in bed with my girlfriend and my dog was in the room in her basket, we were watching tv it was about half past 11 at night give or take 15 minutes. All of a sudden the dog started crying put its tail under her legs and hid, and then as if on cue this blinding red light came through the blinds and felt a humming in my body but could not hear anything, my girlfriend who was right next to me at the time felt exactly the same thing, we were both scared to death i have read a lot of books and seen a lot of documenterys on ufo's and aliens and this has convinced me and definately convinced my girlfriend who was not a beleiver in this.  we both tried to peer through the blinds but the light was just too blinding it was just hovering above our house and where we lived in redmond was on the top of a hill over a valley so there was absolutely no doubt that this is indeed genuine.  i now live in london and have done since early 1996 and i hope the zip code i gave you is correct because i do not have my u.s. license anymore and the zip im pretty sure is correct. this craft if i may call it that was incredibly bright and huge and would  be amazed if nobody else saw this craft, i cant stop thinking about this sighting it really has got me hooked on trying to find the truth behind all of these sightings and beleive me they do exist i just hope that a member of the public from redmond also saw this and could verify my story.â€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
