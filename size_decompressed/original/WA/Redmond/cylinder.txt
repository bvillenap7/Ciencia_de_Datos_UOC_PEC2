Needle shaped light, possible space debris, crossed slowly from horizon to horizon, due east over Seattle area.;2002-11-28 06:15:00;35-45 seconds;((NUFORC Note:  Reported to be re-entering space debris.  We are grateful to all of those who submitted reports.  PD)) Needle shaped light, possible space debris, crossed slowly from horizon to horizon, due east over Seattle area. A large needle shaped object, possibly space debris crossed the dark morning sky from horizon to horizon, travelling due east.  It was brightly illuminated, like a burning meteorite but it must have been quite large because it appeared to move slowly and remained in my field of view for at least 40 seconds.  The east and west horizons were obstructed due to trees and the office building where I work, but I was able to view at least 120 degrees of the night sky (sunrise not occurred yet).  Part of the object may have split off since a second brightly lit contrail appeared for about 5 to 7 seconds.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004

Stepped outside and I was looking into the sky and out of the corner of my eye I noticed some movement. At this time behind the trees across the freeway I noticed what looked like two long planes with no wings moving together at a very high rate of speed, faster than the planes that normaly fly in the area. This movement was different as it was moving North to South and traveling very fast. Most planes are coming from the South and then turn West over the freeway or just the opposite they are coming from the West and then head South. It appeared as if the planes moved in tandem and merged for a second and then disapeared out of view. Also the planes appeared to blend in with the sky as they were in a stealth mode, transpearent.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
