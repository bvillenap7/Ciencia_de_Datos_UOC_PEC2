April 13, 2005 I was driving in stop and go traffic slowly eastbound on Redmond Way in Redmond Washington at approximately 5:15/5:30pm and looked out of my drivers side window (north) and looked up to the middle of a Cumulonimbus cloud that was lurking over the northern Seattle area and noticed a black object hovering in front of the middle of the cloud. It started to swing back and forth like a pendulum in mid air and stopping mid-swing.  It moved in a non-linear fashion, sometimes slowly upwards or to the side. It rose up in front of the clouds in this manner as I watched it while driving. I watched it for about 5-7 minutes and it lost my site due to tall tree cover. I know it was not a plane or a helicopter or weather balloon. It was shaped in no manner to indicate such. It appeared to be like a disc from the side, it shifted in perspective from oval to a straight line. The actual size of the object is unknown because the distance from the car to the object was too far to determine. PS:My girlfriend was driving directly behind me and witnessed the event also. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with both witnesses via telephone, and they sounded to us to be exceptionally objective, rational, sober-minded witnesses.  We do not know what it was they witnessed, unless they might have been hot air balloons, which fly in they area near Seattle, but in a second conversation with the witness, he assures us that the objects were in no way similar to balloons.
