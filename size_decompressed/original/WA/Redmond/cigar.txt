orange blimp in night sky, redmond Wa;1987-04-23 20:30:00;5  minutes;orange blimp in night sky, redmond Wa i was thirteen yrs old walking home from a friends house just after dark.  I felt a strong energy like a magnetic pull.  I looked to the sky and just above the tree line about three football fields in length away, i witnessed a blimp shaped object hovering.  It made a very low pitched humm! and was bright orange and redish in color.  It had windows which appeard to be in the same location of that of a blimp would be.  I stared in disbelief for a few minutes it seemed then realizing what i was seeing I ran to the closest front door of a home.  I pounded on the front door. A woman answered the door,  I frantically tried to explain to her there was something in the sky outside and she needs to come see for herself.  She slammed the door shut immediately.  I ran back out to the spot i was before and it was still there.  I dont recolect how long i continued to stare up at this object but it had a strange aura and frequency that was very strong and pulling.  I don't remember going home i just woke up in my bed and have never forgotten this night. I am now thirty five years old and tell this story to people who seem to be openminded enought to maybe believe it was real.  thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
