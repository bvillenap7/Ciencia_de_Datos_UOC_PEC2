Orange/amber blurb of light swaying from left to right, changing in brightness;2001-08-15 23:30:00;45-50 minutes;Orange/amber blurb of light swaying from left to right, changing in brightness About an hour and a half ago, around 11:30, my brother pointed out an orangish glow in the sky about 30 degrees up in the sky. At first I questioned it to be Mars, but it began to slowly move to the rifht in shaky movements. The orange/amber object continued to move towards a a patch of trees in the foreground, though after watching it for about 30 minutes, it began swaying from side to side. Also when a normal airliner flew overhead, it made a sudden, quite agressive (about a 45 degree) turn to the left, away from the object. The object continued to move in this manner, often in almost a circular way until finally disapearing behind a large group of trees.  Also a witness, my brother's girlfriend. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date to August 15, which we assume was the correct date.  Also, we suspect Mars.  If a witness stares at a celestial body in the night sky for even a short period of time, the person generally will report that the object appears to be moving.  It is the result of the fact that the eyes move, giving the impression that the object is moving.  There may be other visual factors involved.  PD));47.6699220000002;-122.119004

First we thought it was a plane but then appeared on fire and as close as a couple miles away. It was white at first at the core, then turned red and then dissapeared into a black big circle and then dissapeared.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
