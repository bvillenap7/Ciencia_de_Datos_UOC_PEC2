Re: washington sighting 1995;1995-08-14 23:00:00;23:30;Re: washington sighting 1995 regarding:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32350.html   I recall seeing this as well, but I believe your witness has the date wrong by two days as well as what the origin of the light actually was--genuine yes, UFO, no. On 8/14/95 (remembered only because it was a friend's birthday), at roughly 11pm, some friends and I were on the Union Hill Road (right in front of what is now the Microsoft Xbox buildings).  We saw some truly spectacular lights up in the sky to the south east.  We pulled the car over, and watched for nearly a half hour.  It was clear that these lights were lightening up in some low-level clouds never striking the ground (maybe 1500 feet? 2000?).  It was a semi-cloudy evening, extremely dry air, and warm (68-70 degrees)--no rain. The colors lit up as red/pink, white, aqua, green and an ivory color.  After about 10 minutes of watching, (roughly 11:15) a Redmond Police officer pulled up and watched the remainder of the show with us.  Because of the odd lack of actual bolt lightening strikes and lack of audible thunder and the funky cloud cover, some of the lights actually looked oval or round, but it was clearly a reflection of the light off/in the clouds.  It was truly one of the most spectacular lightening shows I can ever remember seeing--especially in Washington.  The air literally felt and even smelled electric.   As you likely know, dry lightening storms are rare in Wa. The storm appeared to happen in a very localized area of the sky.  Very near Union Hill, but I'm sure it could have been seen by anyone on Novelty Hill and the Redmond Plateau (perhaps even Education Hill) as well and seemed to be contained to one group of very puffy, white, billowy clouds. For as long as I watched these lights, I have no doubt that it was just a very cool weather anomaly all friends and the Redmond Officer all agreed that is was lightening, albeit very strange lightening.  The color flashes would have been really wild if you were on top of one of those hills which are about 500-800ft in elevation.   As far as I know, the storm was never reported, which I thought was odd since it lasted for about a half hour and it was so vivid. I recall watching the news the following day to see if it would end up on the weather report, but if it did, I never caught it.  It may be worth noting that the officer got no calls on his radio while he stood with us on the shoulder of the road, and he was with us for 15-20 minutes. I don't recall him radioing anything in either.

All of a sudden the dog started crying put its tail under her legs and hid, and then as if on cue this blinding red light came through the blinds and felt a humming in my body but could not hear anything,  my girlfriend who was right next to me at the time felt exactly the same thing, we were both scared to death i have read a lot of books and seen a lot of documenterys on ufo's and aliens and this has convinced me and definately convinced my girlfriend who was not a beleiver in this. we both tried to peer through the blinds but the light was just too blinding it was just hovering above our house and where we lived in redmond was on the top of a hill over a valley so there was absolutely no doubt that this is indeed genuine.  i now live in london and have done since early 1996 and i hope the zip code i gave you is correct because i do not have my u.s. license anymore and the zip im pretty sure is correct.  this craft if i may call it that was incredibly bright and huge and would be amazed if nobody else saw this craft, i cant stop thinking about this sighting it really has got me hooked on trying to find the truth behind all of these sightings and beleive me they do exist i just hope that a member of the public from redmond also saw this and could verify my story.

bright light that did not move at all. 1 bright light turned to 3 distinguishable lights. dissappeared suddenly;1999-09-05 00:30:00;3 minutes;bright light that did not move at all. 1 bright light turned to 3 distinguishable lights. dissappeared suddenly Driving from work in downtown Redmond, WA at 12:25 am. Saw a bright light with a slight glow in the sky. Direction was SSE from my vantage point. I cannot judge the distance to the light. Thought initially it may have been a meteorite re-entering atmosphere. However, it did not move at all and there was no trail. As I drove, the light appeared to stay in same exact place. Thought could be small aircraft or helicopter, but there were no visible nav marker lights. LIght did not seem to be consistent with helicopter search lites. Light was yellow-orange. As I continued to drive home up a hill overlooking the valley, the light seemed to continue in the same spot. While hanging there, the one bright light rotated or otherwise seemed to become 3 distinguishable lights of the same color. Trying not to crash, I decided to turn around so I could drive back a few hundred yards to a spot where I could see the light(s) clearly. I pulled off onto a side street and turned around. When I! started back down the hill the light(s) were gone. As I drove around (including getting on the 520 highway), I noticed an inordinate amount of police cars(8)driving around rather quickly. I looked for another 15 minutes and did not see the lights again.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
Brilliant object -5 magnitude or brighter traveling WNW and disappearing with unusual rapidity.;2000-07-27 22:05:00;2 seconds;Brilliant object -5 magnitude or brighter traveling WNW and disappearing with unusual rapidity. Brilliant white object traveling WNW at about 45 degrees above the horizon traveling in a WNW direction (300 degrees).  Object was crystaline white and did not streak as much as simply vanish totally.  Far brighter white than any meteors I've seen in the past probably brighter than venus and did not seem to diminish in brightness before disappearing.  There were scattered clouds in that area of the sky.  Later the clouds parted and I estimate the location as just a little south of the tail of the big dipper.  It did not travel more than 5 degrees before vanishing.  Had in been a meteor, given the brillance (like a welders torch).  Had it been a meteor, I would  have expected it to continue on and reappear outside the area of scattered clouds and travelled several tens of degrees.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004

The three of us were on my back porch.  far up in the sky we saw a light similar to a star slowly travel across the sky.  After about two minutes we saw a second light fly up, than to the right, than back and forth several times, than dissapear.  We continued watching the main light.  As we watched it became blurry and faded in and out of sight.  finally it dissapeared.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004

I didn't think this was much more than a shooting star until I saw the report from Bellevue, WA on the same evening.  (Bellevue is south of my location)  At approximately 12:20am, I was taking my dog for a final walk before going to bed.  The night was extremely calm, and the sky was extremely clear. (both rare in the Seattle area)  I stood in one spot, waiting for him to do his business, and was scanning the sky for satellites, and constellations.  I finished scanning the north sky, and turned to scan the southern sky (towards Bellevue), and just as I turned, I saw a bright blue-white light, about 5mm wide in the sky (from my point of view) very quickly shoot from west to east with no trail, and disappeared completely after it had traveled about 4 inches (once again, from my point of view).  I took note of the time, becuase it struck me as odd, and seemed to be too large in the sky to be a normal shooting star that would disappear so quickly.  I live in a valley, so I cannot be sure how high it was, but it was to the south-south-east, and 65-75 degrees up.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004

The object was clearly following the space station.  After about 5 minutes of watching it from one end of the sky and clear across the other end it vanished from sight.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
I think I saw a UFO...it was a bright light that looked like a star that ascended into the heavens within five seconds.;2013-08-08 23:30:00;2 minutes;I think I saw a UFO...it was a bright light that looked like a star that ascended into the heavens within five seconds June 9, 2014   To whom it may concern,  I think I may have seen an unidentified flying object.  I am not crazy and at the time, I was totally within my senses.  I wasn’t drinking or doing drugs. I was totally alert and fully aware of my surroundings. I was pet-sitting for a friend and at approximately 11:30 pm, I was outside in the yard while the dogs were going to the bathroom and doing their thing. This particular night the sky was very clear.  The stars were so bright.  I started to gaze up – and just stood there looking at the stars for a couple of minutes. That’s when I saw it.  At first, I thought it was a shooting star.  Because it shot across the sky—fast.  I thought I was lucky witnessing a shooting star, so I got excited and continued to watch with fascination. The light I saw was very bright. Like a star.  It was high up in the sky too—just like a star.  Except this light moved fast—very fast.  The bright light then started to move upward.  Within a matter of seconds, (we are talking zero to five seconds later), this bright light ascended into the heavens and was out of sight. What I saw scared me.  I didn’t get a warm fuzzy feeling about it either.  I was anxious and a little frightened.  I immediately went back inside.  For the rest of the night, I was on edge.  I even had trouble sleeping. My friends think I’m crazy whenever I mention this.  Honestly though, whatever it was—totally and completely scared me so much, that to this day, I do not gaze up at the stars anymore. Maybe it was a re-fueling mission.  Maybe it was a satellite.  I don’t know. Whatever this light was, it traveled so fast that within a matter of seconds it was out of sight. Thank you.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004

I noticed the flying thing, had did a flash twice when it was like it was disappearing and reappearing next to where it disappeared, it was moving like ti was in a certain area it was like it was moving within a radius, it moved around the area but didn't ever leave the area, it looked like the others stars in the sky except it didn't stay still like they did, it moved around abruptly, it looked high up and appeared to have a very irrodecent light colored looking trail behind it when it moved with higher speed, it would stop then shoot over a little bit stop, go up a couple stops then do a circle , then stop, it just kept doing that, not sure what it is but the weather here was clear and no clouds , I was standing in a very dark area, so I could see the stars really well, let me know if there were ia any other sightings, it just looked like a light, and seemed to get di! m and go back and forth , but it only got really bright when i! t was sk ipping over from spot to spot, no moving but, it would suddenly disappear and reappear at the same time kinds of and when it moved from that spot it was really bright until it got to the next spot which is right next to its first location then it would remain bright for a while and move around , I am not what it was, but I saw it moving around and it did things no drone or plane I know of , its not a meteor , star, planet, space command module, it didn't have much consistency for its movement, and since it looked like the other stars it I was shocked to see it moving from place to place,it never fizzled out of brightness, the color almost looked light a blue, light blue, its hard to describe, but everyone else saw it moving to, and stopping then going again, it looked like it was not in the atmosphere, thanks;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
Brilliant white light traveling East to West very fast at a steep angle of descent over Redmond, Washington.;2015-02-15 16:30:00;3 seconds;Brilliant white light traveling East to West very fast at a steep angle of descent over Redmond, Washington. 2015-02-15 (Sunday 20:00 - 20:30) Clear Sky - No Clouds In passenger vehicle SEA-TAC Air Traffic Visible Overhead and in the Distance. While driving south on 166th AVE NE in Redmond, Washington my passenger and i BOTH saw a brilliant white light traveling EAST to WEST in an what seemed to be a descending flight path. The light was much brighter than the SEA-TAC air traffic. No debris/sparks/trailing fire were visible at or near the object. The object was traveling significantly faster than the commercial SEA-TAC aircraft traffic that were visible. The object was traveling EAST to WEST from approximately 10:00 (EAST) to 3:00 (WEST). SEA-TAC air traffic is a constant presence in the sky over our community. I've seen many different types of aircraft of varying types (private, commercial, and military fixed, rotary, and jets) in the sky over Redmond at different altitudes. Never have I seen any aircraft traveling at this speed.  Additionally the apparent angle of descent had me expecting a fireball in the  distance.  Nothing.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004

There was one bright light some distance ahead of the other five objects.  They were all traveling at the same speed.  The four bright lights trailing the lead object would quickly change position in the sky.  Much quicker than I would suspects an airplane could do.  The dark object underneath those four objects never changed position.  There was no noise associated with their movement through the sky.

long string of moving lights.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 21:30:00;20 minutes;long string of moving lights Last night (April 30) my wife and I observed a peculiar occurrence in the sky.  We live a few miles east of Redmond WA.  We decided to spend some time in our hot tub, and about 9:20 PM my wife went in first.  When I joined her about 5 minutes later, she said she was seeing something strange in the sky, namely a series of moving lights.  These were points of light about the brightness of a 3- or 4-magnitude star, moving one after another in a straight line from northwest to southeast, evenly spaced, moving at the same speed, and apparently quite high up.  From our position the line or track initially led directly toward the star Arcturus, but slowly shifted westward a few degrees.  From our deck we could see the track for about a quarter of the sky,  from the eave of our house directly overhead to some trees on the edge of our property.  An individual light took 30 or 40 seconds to traverse this interval, and a new one would appear before the previous one had disappeared.  My wife said she had already seen perhaps a dozen when I came out, and together we witnessed maybe 20 or 30 more.  After about 15 minutes, clouds moved in, lit by the quarter moon high in the west, and obscured our vision.  We frequently see aircraft while in the hot tub, most commonly flying east to west, at no great height, and showing some typical combination of white, red and green lights.  But the lights we saw last night were nothing like this. (In fact, we only saw one other aircraft during this interval, flying up from the south at moderate altitude and passing to the southeast.  Even it was a bit atypical, having only two bright yellowish-white lights like car headlights.) My first thought was that we were seeing some military transport, but the sheer number of lights seemingly makes this explanation unlikely. In summary, I have been watching the sky my whole life, and have never witnessed anything like this event. My wife was a bit unnerved. Any insight you can ! provide would be most appreciated.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
