Single White Flashes in the sky changing positions erratically every 3-10 seconds.;2005-07-04 00:50:00;2-3 minutes;Single White Flashes in the sky changing positions erratically every 3-10 seconds. I was looking east in the sky slightly left of the contstallation Casiopea, when I saw what looked like a magnitude 2-3 star flash.  It flashed once in the first position.  I then flashed again once, but as if it were headed north.  About 3 seconds later it flashed again, but back to it's original position.  It proceeded to flash once in a different position about 8 seconds later.  The next flash was dimmer (magnitude 5).  Then it disappeared for about 30 seconds.  Another single flash happened.  Then it disappeared.  This single flash was a white color, almost like a star, except there was no briliance to it.  As a pilot for 10 years, I can tell you, this was no general aviation strobe, nor a commercial strobe light.  My wife, who was star gazing at the time also saw this erratic flash of light, at first she thought it was a shooting star, but after it reappeared  a few times in the same position back an forth, it was clear this was not that either.  Immediately called my friend who was out at the same time as me from Sammamish an saw the same flash, but only once.  There was no shape or detail obsereved, only a single white flashes....and it was no flare, fireworks, or anything of the sort.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
