Bright white light seen by me in the sky southwest, thought it was a star, then a plane, then it was moving towards many miles away.  As it got closer, I stepped inside and called my daughter to see it too.  It was then right overhead about 1 mile up or higher, shaped triangular, and had underneath 3 lights, red and blue.  It made no sound, and then it passed till we couldn't see it thru the trees.  Went out front but couldn't see it, too cold to stay out.  We came inside and drew what we saw.  Full moon night.  1st sighting.  Never have seen anything like it.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
