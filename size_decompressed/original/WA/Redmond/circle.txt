It appeared to have a short tail. The object was about a quater of the size of the moon.  It was very luminescent and bright.  It appeared to be bright yellow or pale orange in color.  It had a short tail of a pale yellow color. It traveled very fast  from the south to the north and out of sight within 6 to 7 seconds. It traveled horizontally about 40 degrees above the horizon.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
The object moved slowly and flashed 5 colors.  I watched it for 30 minutes before going to bed.;1999-07-29 02:15:00;30 min.;The object moved slowly and flashed 5 colors.  I watched it for 30 minutes before going to bed. I went out to smoke a ciggarette at about 2:15 am and saw a bright light through the trees in my yard.  It was at about 35 to 40 degrees in the sky, and was twinkling brightly.  Soon it moved so that I could not see it, so I changed positions and there it was.  It moved again and again, but only slightly, and with no orderly direction.  It was emitting very bright white lights and flashing colors now and then, with no order or pattern.  The main colors were red, and yellow, with some aqua, and twice a purple blue color.  I moved to my neighbor's yard to watch it without the trees in the way, and it hovered for the whole 30 minutes I watched, with some movement.  A Plane approached once but then turned off, and the object stayed where it was.  I showed my husband the place where I had seen it, and he guessed it must have been about 2 miles high.  It was MUCH brighter than the stars, but not close enough that I could make out a shape, but the lights it gave off suggested a sphere shape.  I don't know for sure what it was, but I have no better guess than a space craft.  Although I could hear the plane that approached, I heard no sound from this object, however it could have been too far away for me to hear.  It appeared to be hovering over the Redmond Valley.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
11:25am - East of Redmond, WA. - white circular object moving in a zigzag manner. Moved North for a little while and then went East.;2004-08-08 11:25:00;1 minute;11:25am - East of Redmond, WA. - white circular object moving in a zigzag manner. Moved North for a little while and then went East. I was lying on my bed which is on the floor and looking into the sky when a circular object, white in color, was moving in the sky. I know that today there is some performance of some aircraft, so I got up to see if that was some aircraft. But to my surprise I noticed that it was not moving in a straight like and also saw that it didn't have a shape ... it was circular. It didn't leave any trail like the jet aircraft do. It was very high up in the sky. It's path was something like a graph ... couldn't be possible for any aircraft. Then I thought it could be a bird. But I closely observed it and found no wings or shape. That's when I started thinking ... Wow ... is that an UFO? I think it is.  It was at 40 degrees elevation on the east side. It was moving North for a while and then it changed direction towards East. Since there are a lot of long trees in my neighborhood, I couldn't see it after a minute when it went further east. It wasn't moving very fast, something like a bird, but it was moving at varying speeds.  My background: I am a 23 year old Asian Indian student interning in Microsoft this summer. I am glad to have sighted what I believe is an Unidentified Flying Object ... wow! I have keen interest in such things ... I have always believed that there must be UFOs ... afterall so many people in the world can't just be lying and the photographs can't be fake all the time! Now I more strongly belive that they are there. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed quite credible to us.  PD));47.6699220000002;-122.119004
Three intensely glowing orange spheres seen. After they past where I was standing, glowing stopped but outline of craft still visible.;2015-07-04 22:46:00;2-3 minutes;Three intensely glowing orange spheres seen.  After they past where I was standing, glowing stopped but outline of craft still visible. At 10:46 PM, my husband and I were driving home from watching fireworks.  We live in a quiet area, fairly well wooded, in a suburban/rural setting, 15 miles east of Seattle.  We live in an area called Union Hill which is 500 feet above sea level and is a hill top above the small city of Redmond, Washington.   We were almost home, a neighborhood with most homes on one acre plots. I was watching out the passenger side window of the car when I saw a large firework explode.  Beside it I saw an immensely, intense glowing orange light, spherical shape, almost like a fireball.  I told my husband to immediately stop the car and back-up.  He did and I jumped out of the car and clearly saw a bright, bright, bright orange ball.  They were off toward the eastern sky, not too far off as they appeared in the same proximity of where I had just seen the firework explode.  (They were not directly overhead.)  Followed close behind was a second orange sphere, identical to the first, and! following the driving line of the first ball.  Then, trailing just slightly further behind, was a third sphere.  All identical in color. The most unbelievable, intense glowing orange I have ever seen.   My husband was on the driver side and keep telling me to take  picture.  I wanted to but just felt that if I moved my eyes the objects would be gone before I could figure out how to get a photo.  I watched for maybe 30 seconds.  All three looked like they were glowing hot.  Once they passed us I could still see them flying but they no longer glowed.  I could see almost like an outline of the ball, faintly defined.  It was as if the glowing part was in the front of the object but the backs were dark.  And then they were gone. My husband says he never really saw them.  But it was like nothing I have ever seen before.  And clearly they were not fireworks. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness corrected the date to July 4th.  We have corrected it above, as of July 10th, 2015.

Ball of fire moving very slowly across the sky.;2015-12-26 18:00:00;1 minute;Looked like a ball of fire moving very slowly across the sky.  It was very visible, as the sky was clear and I am surprised no body has reported it so far.  It might have been a piece of some aircraft burning and falling down the sky.

Flying Object Viewed by Two Who Never Witnessed Anything Similar;2019-11-30 02:23:00;31;Flying Object Viewed by Two Who Never Witnessed Anything Similar Woke up looking out window with open blinds in Redmond toward S/SW direction appx 0220.  Very bright (appx 4x more than Venus) light emitting six to eleven rays (disputed between partners).  Object moving up and down despite head of first viewer lying stationary on mattress.  Woke up wife/ partner. Asked her to stand up and report what was seen outsode. Both viewed something never seen before. Both sober. Both viewed rays from object moving as if defying law pf gravity. Only white in color.  Only watched for appx 30 minutes.  Recorded with Iphone SE that fails to even observe branches in nearby trees at night.  While another object flew closer rathet than further toward the initial object, its trajectory would not lead to a convergence.  The latter (man made) object also appeared as closer to the viewers.  Called friend to view as 3rd witness and left him a voicemail. He did not reply/listen to voicemail until next day.  Recorded anyway.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
