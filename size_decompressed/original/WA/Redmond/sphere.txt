Greenish-white sphere seen heading North over I-405, Kirkland/Lynnwood area;2001-07-12 00:15:00;A few seconds;Greenish-white sphere seen heading North over I-405, Kirkland/Lynnwood area I was driving East on Hwy520, from Bellevue to Redmond past the 148th Exit, when I noticed a strange light to the North. When I looked up I noticed a large white/green light travelling North. It was circular with a greenish halo and trail. It's size looked about as large as a penny held out at arm's length. It looked to be fairly high up, maybe just below cloud level. I was only able to watch it for a few seconds as I was driving but the last I saw was when it appeared to burst into flames. It looked like a falling star except it was much closer. It appeared to be over the Kirkland area. My friend had left work at the same time, and was heading North on I-405. He saw the exact same object heading over almost directly overhead I-405 heading North.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
