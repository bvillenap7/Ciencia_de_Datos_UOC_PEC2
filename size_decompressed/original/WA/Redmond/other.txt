I looked out my bedroom window and saw a ferris wheel type shaped object hovering and glowing red, yellow and green.;2003-07-31 22:45:00;2-4 minutes;I looked out my bedroom window and saw a ferris wheel type shaped object hovering and glowing red, yellow and green. I was getting into bed and just happened to look out the window and I caught a glimpse of a glowing object in between the trees. I just thought that it was another airplane and was waiting for it to clear the trees so that I could get a better look at it.  When it finally did clear the trees, I saw this extra large glowing object that was round.  It had greenish, reddish, and yellowish glowing lights.  The only way I can really describe it is that it looked like a ferris wheel with the lights glowing and pulsing.  At first I didn't have my glasses on and I thought it was blurry so I put my glasses on and it was the same.  It looked like it was just hovering in the air, or moving very slowly in the north western direction.  Then all of a sudden it sped up and quickly took off to the west and I couldn't see it anymore.  It was making a sound that I could hear and it sounded kind of like a humming sound and it sounded like it was low to the ground.  My son was in the other room and when I went into the room to ask him if he saw or heard it, he said that he heard it and that it sounded like it was really low to the ground.  I was just amazed at the shape and the glowing lights of this thing in the air.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
Tumbling balloon-like object, very large and high, square angles, white.;2005-09-07 13:30:00;4 minutes +;Tumbling balloon-like object, very large and high, square angles, white. Walking with my toddler, he spotted something in the sky and pointed, saying Star.  (He knows Stars are in the sky, although it was daytime.)  That day there were clear blue skies - a minimum of haze.  We were walking in the vicinity of Marymoor park.  If he hadn't pointed it out to me, I would have never seen it.  At first I thought it was a normal child's white balloon.  When I focused on it, it seemed much larger and higher than a normal balloon, and was shaped along rectangular forms, something like a blocky chair.  It seemed to be tumbling quite freely, and lazily, like something in freefall.  This naturalistic motion was what caused me to first think of it as a balloon along with everday expectation.  But the tumbling didn't seem to fit with it being a balloon.  The size, tumbling, and shape all struck me as odd.  The tumbling is what stuck in my mind.  I lost sight of it after a few minutes.

I saw 2 slow moving lights (about 1/3 the speed of most satellites) in the sky moving in tandem (not planes).;2014-07-27 23:45:00;1 minute;I saw 2 slow moving lights (about 1/3 the speed of most satellites) in the sky moving in tandem (not planes). I saw 2 slow moving lights (about 1/3 the speed of most satellites) in the sky, brighter than stars (not planes, way too high in the sky).  There was no sound.   They were traveling in tandem in a straight line (from the ground looking up) about 1 inch apart.  They were traveling from the southwest to the northeast in direction.   I went inside the house to get binoculars and a second observer.  However because of various trees I was not able to require the objects again when I came back outside.   I stayed outside for another hour and saw two different satellites go by.  What I saw was much brighter than the two satellites and appeared to be lower in orbit.   In that time I also saw two airline jets and one air plane.  What I saw was definitely not jets, airliners or air planes.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
Meteor-like object seen over Redmond, Washington.;2014-08-24 20:15:00;~45 seconds;meteor like object seen over redmond washington Over Redmond/Issaquah, Washington, Sunday 8/24/14 @ 8:15pm. Husband and I saw what resembled a meteor.  A small dark spot followed by a thick short vapor.  Was unlike a jet in that there were no lights (and no jet)and it did not present like any contrail I've seen in my life time.   It was odd to us, so we felt compelled to share.  Difficult to judge the distance,  It looked close.  This continued till the trees blocked our view after about 45 secs.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
White orb that is 1/4 the size of the moon at around 1500 feet moving over the sound barrier ((anonymous report));2019-09-19 14:10:00;2.5 seconds;White orb that is 1/4 the size of the moon at around 1500 feet moving over the sound barrier instantly from a stand still. At around 1:45 me and my friend left work to go to his house and grab some things.  after about 22 minutes we arrived at the park and were parking to go smoke and chill as usual. We got out the car and started walking to the benches by the Tennis court.  My friend turned and faced me looking around the SW direction.  I was already facing North West moving my head looking around because we just arrived.  Then without expecting it a light I was seeing and made no second thought about moved out of sight behind trees to my right in 2.5 seconds.  When I first saw it moving I thought it was a shooting star but I soon realized it was below cloud cover, going straight, and had no tail made up of light.  There was no sound.  The light was a white orb shaped object.  The exact direction I was looking toward in the moment was 311 degrees North West.  From my vantage point the object started from a little to the left from where i was looking, but I remember seeing the light in a! stand still (I had no thoughts at the time about the light) I told my friend about it but he visibly didn't seem to believe me.  I am no expert on speeds or elevations or any of the sort but the object at least to me looked like it was going past the sound barrier at 1500 feet (The fastest I've seen anything move).  The orb was white and from where I was looking looked to be around 1/4 the size of the moon if you were looking at the moon from earth.  I checked for 30 minutes after the sighting and nothing re-appeared.  One thing to note is I have been experiencing strange coincidences lately that don't really make sense and should have never happened.;47.6699220000002;-122.119004
