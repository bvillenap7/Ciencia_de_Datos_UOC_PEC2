TRIANGLE VESSEL OVER WHIDBEY ISLAND, WASHINGTON.;2015-03-22 23:15:00;Seconds;TRIANGLE VESSEL OVER WHIDBEY ISLAND, WASHINGTON Earth Day welcomed an unexplainable visitor.  The star-speckled backdrop of the night sky was overshadowed by the presence of an unexpected craft.  A triangular shaped vessel greater in length than any aircraft carrier this submariner ever saw, passed stealthily over the tree canopy not more than 500’ to 700’.  With the exception of bow and stern light, there wasn’t a peep coming from this vessel, not even an engine roar.  Even the owls, coyotes, blue heron and frogs took note of its presence as all went silent.  The city lights were just enough to unveil the outline of the craft but not enough to identify any markings indicating origin.   As it passed overhead heading east towards Everett from Whidbey Island, I raced to an open meadow to witness this magnificent event with greater clarity.  I know what I saw.  I just don’t know who sent it. The next day I waited patiently for the subject to air on the radio and nothing would be said.  Even the naval air station that is just nine miles away as the crow flies from the event made no mention of it.  A couple of days would pass before the subject would appear on a local radio show a friend and I were listening to.   It appears that this is not the first time such a sighting had appeared in this region or around the country for that matter.  Not surprising though that this sighting didn’t make the radar of the federally controlled national media.;48.2217;-122.6838
