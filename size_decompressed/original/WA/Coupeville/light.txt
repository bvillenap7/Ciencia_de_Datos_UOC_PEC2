UFOS that will not take snap-shots.;2012-06-19 22:55:00;3 minutes;UFOS that will not take snap-shots. last night I was in my back yard, With my dog.  Before we went to Bed, I saw two UFOS flying north going by the NAVY Base on Whidbey. I been wathing them for years.  And been trying to get a good photo of them.with video or a camera but every time I get the film developed I get blank photos.  The third ufo fly by was going south,  Real slow real close and real bright.I snaped 10 shots of it.And thought I finaly got a good shot.  The next day I got the film developed,and every shot was blank. So now I don't know what I can do.  I know if I had infer-red I would get a good shot.  thank you.ps I will call back soon.;48.2217;-122.6838
