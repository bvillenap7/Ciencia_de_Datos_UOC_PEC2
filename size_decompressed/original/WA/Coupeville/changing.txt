Growing, organic light separates into individual gold lights;2012-09-22 20:15:00;15-20 minutes;Growing, organic light separates into individual gold lights I was sitting with a friend on a hill overlooking ebey's landing, facing south around 8:30 pm, 9/22/12, when I noticed a growing golden light on the horizon.  It was an ammorphose blob that grew upwards into the sky.  Hard to tell its size.   As it grew larger it expanded into hundreds of seperate lights.  They weren't in any formation, just moving upwards and spreading out.  A vehicle drove up to us and the gentlemen inside asked us if we're seeing this.  He said he thinks he's looking at his first ufo sighting.   We sat watching them spread out overhead.   We suspect it was a release of lanterns, but puzzled because there's a burn ban here.  Our forests are tinder dry.   It was pretty spectacular and I have seen no news about what it was.  Hoping someone will speak up.;48.2217;-122.6838
