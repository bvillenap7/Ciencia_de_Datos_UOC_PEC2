Looking east at approximately 6:00 PM on 2/05/10 I saw a triangle of colored lights stationary in the air, barely above the tree tops. I then saw another to the right, higher and farther away. The first one was close enough to make out the shape and colors of it quite clearly: A distinct triangle of blue, red, green and yellow lights. It looked very much like a Christmas decoration, and if it were in a position to possibly be atop something I wouldnâ€™t have questioned it. But when I saw the other, higher and farther away, also stationary, I was baffled. I went around to the front of our house to get a better angle above the tree tops and saw, to the west, two more triangles.  These were dancing in the air. Flitting about. Then they sped off. I went back to the back yard and the two triangles were still there but each higher in the sky and farther away.  So, not stationary, but I was unable to see them move because it was so gradual.  One hour later the two in the back were still visible but much farther away and higher in the sky. We live near an air force base and have witnessed Harrier jets come to complete stops in mid air.  I would love to have that be the answer.  I just question why they would be lit up like Christmas trees and stay floating high in the sky for hours.   Also the triangles were always facing me so if they were on the wings and the nose of a plane it would have to have spent all its time on its side to give that view.;48.0193;-122.4589
