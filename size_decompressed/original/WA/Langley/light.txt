It was a clear morning 8/22/20, quiet, and looking closer saw it was bigger and hovering, spinning.  It also changed colors and went to white.  It started left, right and back getting smaller.  Last I looked it was 4:23 AM, so a good 24 minutes viewed.  I took video with my iPhone.  Sending via email with date.;48.0193;-122.4589
