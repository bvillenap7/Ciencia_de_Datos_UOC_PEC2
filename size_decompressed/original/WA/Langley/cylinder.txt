Five witnesses observe long, slender, tubular obj. w/ pointed nose moving N to S in W sky. Descends, disappears behind Olympic Mtns.;1996-02-09 17:50:00;5 min.;Man reports witnessing, with four other people, a long, slender, tubular-shaped object, with a pointed nose, travelling from north to south in the western sky against the setting sun.  It was just above the Olympic Mountains, and they viewed it with a 30-power spotting scope.  It looked black, very long, shaped like a missle with a very pointed nose, and it was very prominent because it was giving off a large smoke plume trail.  They watched it for 5 minutes, when suddenly it dipped its nose down, descended, and disappeared behind the Olympic Mountains. NOTE:  Could the time of 1750 hrs. be wrong??  It should be 1850 hrs., to conform to the other sighting from Whidbey Island.  Check notes and tape recorded message.  (Written report from Albert Gabelein states that it was 1750-1800 hrs. that they saw the object.)  Ask both parties whether it was light or dark when they saw their respective objects of interest.;48.0193;-122.4589
