Shiny Boomerang shape flying over Langley;2013-01-02 01:30:00;2 minutes;Shiny Boomerang shape flying over Langley Looked like a rounded chevron or boomerang flying west.  It made no noise and looked as if it was reflecting light, not emitting light.  It was a clear night and if there had been any details on the object (landing gear, engine housings) they would have been easily visible, but there were none.;48.0193;-122.4589
