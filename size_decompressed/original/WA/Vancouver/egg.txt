White object on clear day;2000-09-14 08:10:00;1 1/2 min.;White object on clear day I never thought I would fill out one of these reports,however on the way to work this morning, I was going south over the Glen Jackson Bridge noticing how beautiful and clear the sky was, watching the planes land when I noticed out of the corner of my right eye a white roundish object high in the sky.  I grabed for my glasses to look closer as I was driving and it was not a balloon, plane or anything else I had ever seen. It appeared to be hovering about 10 miles away and I would say maybe 10,000 feet high.  This item did not move.  I watched it as I continued to go over the bridge thinking I would pull , I glanced down at the traffic, looked back up and it had completely disappeared. Very strange.

The craft slowly climbed and then vanished.;2003-07-04 20:30:00;2 minutes;The craft slowly climbed and then vanished. I was sitting in west Vancouver waiting to watch the fireworks that evening when I decided to take out the binoculars. I then thought to look at the moon(visible 24 hours a day). And I noticed a small object moving across my line of sight. When I first saw it I figured it was a weather baloon or, one released by a child. But then upon further examination it appeared to be mettalic and was slowly climbing. I told my dad, he didn't quite believe me(skeptic). And I continued to watch the object and then after I had only been watching it for a few more seconds, it vanished.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Bright white and blue light with red lights flashing around it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));2005-02-10 23:20:00;1 hour 10 minutes;Bright white and blue light with red lights flashing around it At 23:20 I went outside to take the dog to the bathroom, when I looked up into the sky above the Columbia River to look at the stars. Our house over looks the river and the West end of the Portland International Airport. When I looked up I saw a very bright light that was white and blue with red lights that flashed and moved around the object. I went back into the house and determined that it was at about 190 degrees on the compass dial from magnetic North. I turned on the television and watched tv for about 40 minutes, when I checked on the object again, it had moved approximately 2 degrees to the West. I went back to the tv and checked again 30 minutes later and it had moved approximately 15 degrees to the West. I fell asleep and when I awoke at 03:00, it was gone. When I was observing it, I never really saw it move, it seemed to hang in the sky with small gyrating motions. I know it was not an incoming airplane or helo because it was way above the normal flight patterns that come into PDX at that time of the night and it hung around too long. I always check the sky every night for anomalies during the last 1.5 weeks I have been here and this is the first time I have seen this object, as I report this on 2/11/04, it is not in the sky tonight (I checked before the clouds rolled in).  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  Sirius would be in the southern sky at the time indicated by the witness.  PD));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
