My friend and I were flying our RC airplanes, mid-morning, calm wind, clear skies.  We were both flying relaxing slow flying planes while sitting in lawn chairs.  We noticed an object directly overhead at an estimated altitude of about 200-300 feet.  It was cylindrical, roughly the proportions of a soda pop can, the surface appeared to be solid and metallic  (shimmering in the sunlight), and had no visible protrusions or markings.  It was COMPLETELY motionless:  no spin, no rotation, no drift .... and it made no sound.  It remained completely motionless for about 5 minutes, then my friend and I had to land our planes when the batteries in the planes ran out.   After landing our planes , we looked back up to see the object .... and it was completely gone . We scanned the sky to see if it had drifted off ( as a balloon would ) , but did not see it anywhere .;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Drones in Vancouver?;2020-05-03 23:30:00;30 minutes +;Drones in Vancouver? Im assuming they were large drones.  You could hear the closest one.  They would fly so far then circle back around.  It kept doing that as it kept moving forward...like they were monitoring or mapping.  The other next closest one was doing the same.  They all had the same lights on them as you would expect on a small aircraft. You could see the others in the distance spread out from each other. One response to my daughters post said they were star link satellites, but these were not those.  These were much lower and you could hear the whirring sound of the propellers from the one that was closest. Tried to find out any info or postings on it...but nothing. Just curious whoâ€™s drones they are and what the purpose was deploying them at that time of night. Not sure when they started. I just noticed them when I went outside around 11:15/11:30 last night.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

I noticed it against the darkening night sky, it had no lights and made no sound. I attempted to follow it in my car but lost sight of it after it disappeared over the houses. I have never seen anything like it before.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
