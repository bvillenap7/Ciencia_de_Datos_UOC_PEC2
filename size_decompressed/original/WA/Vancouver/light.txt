Theobject made strange movements,and flew away. At about 2:45am on 6-14-97, my sister,boyfriend and I were driving home from workon I-205 north bound. My sister was lookingout the window and noticed a strange light inthe skies above us. She said,I never seen anairplane like that before! I stopped the carand the three of us got out of the car to geta better  view. we used some binoculars,butcould not see any better. There was no noisefrom the thing we saw. It was just a singularwhite strobe light. Nothing like Ive seen onairplanes, helicopters,and such. We watchedthe object for about 5 mins moving off to thenorth making a circular movement, like it wasspiraling to the north. It shot off to thewest until it was about NNW from us and continued its north bound course. We watched ituntil we could no longer see the object;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

I was enjoying some raccoon company from the hot tub. The direction I was facing is southwest.  A very bright phosphorous green light attracted my attention as it appeared in the sky southwest of Vancouver, WA and came down to earth quickly in what I think was a northwest direction.  The light had a slight northern slant (almost vertical) to it and was visible for three to five seconds.I am not sure whether it just abruptly left my area of vision or whether the treetops obscured my view. The light was a very bright phosphorous green. I don't believe that it was a meteor because of its slow speed. My immediate thought was fireworks but it was too large and didn't go UP in my field of vision because I would have seen that, too.`;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Two lights moving at a high rate of speed and slowing down very fast, then turning faster than anything we've ever made.;2000-07-24 23:30:00;15 min;Two lights moving at a high rate of speed and slowing down very fast, then turning faster than anything we've ever made. Well we were laying on the ground in the back when I said Is that star moving?  My friend got up, looked at it and said Yeeeeah it's movin alright.  Then it stoped. But it started moving very fast toward the south.  We lost it after that point.  2nd one.  We then started looking at the sky more closely.  THen we were about to go inside and I spotted another one moving south very fast toward highway 14.  It slowed down faster than anything I have ever seen.  then procced east slow at first but then in a blink of an eye it was gone.  They were so high that the shape couldn't be determined.

Twinkling color changing lights seen from Vancouver Washington.;2000-09-15 22:50:00;10 plus minutes;Twinkling color changing lights seen from Vancouver Washington. While sitting on the front porch we saw  what we thought was a star.  It seemed like it was changing color from red to bluish white and possibly green.  We got out our binoculars to get a closer look. Through the binoculars it appeared as though there was a smaller light (bluish in color) moving up and down underneath the original light.  Both of the lights were twinkling and changing color. The original light hasn't moved but our son also saw another little bluish light at the 7o'clock position.  My boyfriend said that while I was filling out this form it appeared as though a very dim shooting star came out of the original light.  The shooting star moved down and to the right of the original light and looked kind of like a firework fizzled out.  There were a few aircraft in the sky but not near the light we saw. It is a very clear night tonight and we can see lots of stuff in the sky, stars etc. Addition to Vancouver lights After filling out my initial form I went to your homepage and the picture of the lights seen in Gilbert in July that look alot like what we saw. The only difference is that we saw more colors.  We have a poor set of binoculars and an even worse telescope but the shape is very similar to the photo you published.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

At approx. 9:50 pm witness #1 and #2 went outside. Witness #1 was looking at the sky and saw a solid light moving toward the East. the light was moving in a zigzaging pattern and at various speeds. He then said hey look at that and pointed to the object. Witness #2 looked up at the object and saw the erratic patterns. Witness #2 came in the house and told us to come out and look at the object in the sky. Witness #3 came out immediatly and saw the object which had then stated to fade to red then back to white several times. Witnesses #4 and #5 came out and saw the object continue its erratic Eastward bound trek. The object went behind a small wisp of clouds and disappeared.We watched a few more mins. waiting for the object to reappear. We saw a light reflection on the clouds about 4 or 5 times before it completely stopped. We never saw another trace of the object.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
observed 5 bright lights seen over Vancouver, WA;2001-09-10 22:25:00;4-6 seconds;observed 5 bright lights seen over Vancouver, WA I saw five lights travelling from the norh past the North Star and past Casiopia (sp?) heading south over Portland, OR.  The first three lights were in a semi-triangular shape.  The back two lights were changing positions back and forth.At the same time, they were  making sharp turns and returning back behind the first three lights without losing forward distance with the first three lights.  The lights travelled 75% of the sky in 4-6 seconds before disappearing into the blur of the Portland lights. The altitude seemed to be higher than a commercial aircraft and lower than a satellite. I am a carpenter and single parent of a 14 yr old.  I enjoy night skywatching and have seen the space shuttle and the space station numerous times.  I have seen countless satellites.  I have observed countless meteorites.  I have never seen anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and found him to be a seemingly quite credible witness.

It was difficult to judge the height of this light because I couldn't make out any object. Suddenly, the light dropped straight down out of the sky towards the ground where it disappeared (before actually reaching the ground). My mother was in a car in front of me. I called her when I got home asking if she saw anything on her way home. She described the same light to me. There was more detail in her description. She witnessed a cluster of lights that hung in the air, then suddenly fell towards the ground, whereupon they disappeared as well.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Moving and shifting star-like object seen over Vancouver WA in conjunction with strange cloud formations.;2006-06-05 11:45:00;15;Moving and shifting star-like object seen over Vancouver WA in conjunction with strange cloud formations. Around 11:45 PM on June 5th, 2006 I was sitting in my truck in the K-Mart parking lot in Vancouver WA waiting for my mom to buy something. I then noticed two thin but very distinct tornado-like tendrils extending from the cumulus clouds in the north. (skies were partly cloudy with puffy white clouds but sunny). These formations were not dark though like regular tornadoes but as white as the clouds themselves were. So, as I watched with facination these cloud ropes form and twist and then dissipate all in a matter of about 3 or 4 minutes, I said in my mind, If you are really out there somewhere (meaning the aliens or just the Other) then please let me see some evidence of your existence. I will help you in any way I can if I only knew you existed. I was really sincere in this telepathic SOS and continued watching the area where the cloud tendrils formed. To my utter surprise, no less than I'd say 20 or 30 seconds after I thought this, a bright starlike object came from over those clouds. At first I figured it must be a jet or something, yet it was very bright yellowish and heading in a south easterly direction towards me. But the light of it did not dim as it traveled and over the entire time I saw it it never flickered or flashed like it was reflecting the sunlight. It was just like a very bright star only during the daytime!       So after about 4 minutes it reached a position to the right of overhead me in the blue sky (about 2 o'clock) and then slowed down and stopped! That instantly ruled out jet or airplane or satellite for me! Then it started traveling to the west towards the 12 o'clock position directly above me. As it did so I watched huge patches of white mist underneath the cumulus clouds start moving rapidly together to the area of the sky underneath this object. Then the object went behind a big cloud directly overhead of me and I watched as parts of even this big cloud swirled in distinctly circular patterns at the edge. After a few more moments of watching I couldn't find it anymore and my mom then arrived and we left.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

An oval light object moved into my still frame photo then immediately disappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  PD));2007-04-20 21:05:00;4 sec;An oval light object moved into my still frame photo then immediately disappeared. An object moved into my still frame photo then immediately disappeared. I was setting up to take a series photos of the moon and Venus setting over the horizon from my deck.   I took about 20 shots with Canon EOS 5D digital SLR. Camera was set on tripod with shutter release attached. Camera settings were ISO 1600, aperture 4.0, and shutter speed 2 seconds. I took one picture every 3 minutes to document the moon and Venus setting over the tree line. On the 6th photo, as I opened the shutter, something flew into the frame moving  right to left. I immediately thought this was an airplane and it was going to ruin the shot. I decided I would wait until the object moved across the frame and immediately take another one. Unexpectedly, the object just disappeared. There was no evidence of it anywhere, the object only made it as far as what is seen in the photo and then nothing, I scanned the sky and no planes were visible anywhere in the vicinity. This should be an airplane, as this is close to the flight path from Seattle to Portland, normally flown by Horizon Air.   To verify, I set up the camera the next night, same weather conditions along with camera settings and took several photos of planes entering the frame.  There is a huge difference between a plane and what was captured on the night of April 20th.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
I awoke and looked out my bedroom window to see what looked like a very bright star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star.  PD));2008-09-04 05:30:00;1 hour +;I awoke and looked out my bedroom window to see what looked like a very bright star, but was moving in an irregular pattern. Very early Thursday morning, I awoke and looked eastward, out my bedroom window to see something that looked like a very large, bright star.  I could see no stars visible in the sky.  I wondered if it was an aircraft, as it appeared to be moving, somewhat like a helicopter.  The color of the light was very bright, like a star.  However, the movements were quite abrupt, quick, backward, forward, up and down.  Then, its shape changed and it appeared to be elongated.  It seemed to turn like this several times and continued to move.  Bright lights seemed to occasionally shoot from it, very rapidly, and the lights were colorful, reddish. I watched it for about half an hour.  After I had watched it for awhile, I thought I should check the time and it was about 5:40 am.  I’m not sure of the time I initially witnessed it.  It gradually moved up, down, back and forth, but was progressing in a southward direction until it became blocked by a tree.  I am not sure how long I watched it, probably about 45 minutes or a bit longer. I have thought I’d like to know if anyone else saw it and would like to compare notes. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star.

Saw four orange stationary lights in Southern sky about 15 degrees in elevation;2010-07-08 22:50:00;1 minute;Saw four orange stationary lights in Southern sky about 15 degrees in elevation I walked outside to get something out of my car (time 10:50 pm PST) and saw 4 orange lights in the Southern sky.  I could see them from my front walkway but not from where I was when I got near my car as my neighbor’s homes were in the way.  They were slightly to the East of due South.  I’d say they were at 15 degrees as far as elevation goes.   Since there were 4 of them and the color was different than the aircraft I see flying into PDX I decided to look at them a little closer. I held still, trying to discern any movement amongst any of the lights using the roof lines of my neighbor’s home as a reference.  I detected no movement and it crossed my mind that they could be stars.   Then I thought about it and looked for other stars in the sky and they were nowhere near the brightness or the color.  As far as brightness goes I would say maybe 10 times as bright as a normal star, and maybe half as bright as the lights I see on the commercial aircraft flying in and out of PDX.  Also they were smaller than the lights of the commercial aircraft appear.   So, I go to my car, which was closer to my neighbor’s and just make a note of it in my head in case I hear an explanation on the news. Coming out of my car, I heard/saw my neighbor’s garage door opening.  I was excited so I went to go tell him what I had seen.  But before I could I thought I’d better go back to were I could see them just to verify they were still there they were gone.  I decided to tell him anyway because he saw me and asked ‘why are you running’?  I then explained what I had just seen.  About 30 seconds later tow teen girls came walking down the sidewalk (east bound).  I asked them had they seen the lights and they said yes.  I asked them if they were freaked out and they said yes.  I told them my story and that I didn’t see what happened to them.  They said the 4 lights moved together into one.  I forget what they said about where they went. I talked to my neighbor a bit about it and then came in and called 911.  They had not heard of anyone else calling in but they gave me the UFO hotline number.  I called a 206 area code number and the gentlemen asked if he could call back in about 5 minutes.  I said yep and asked him if he was busy with the same thing I just saw.  He said yes.  I then called KGW Portland TV news, and asked if they had any reports yet.  They said no but they would contact dispatch to se if anything had been reported.  A few minutes later a gentleman from the National UFO Reporting Center called and said someone else had just called him also and they were filling out a report.   He then asked if I had internet access and I said I was right next to my PC.   He asked if I’d fill out a report and that’s what I’m doing now.

Four bright lights I assumed to be planes heading to a nearby international airport suddenly vanished and no planes landed.;2010-07-08 23:00:00;5 minutes;Four bright lights I assumed to be planes heading to a nearby international airport suddenly vanished and no planes landed. Thursday evening, July 8th, around 11 PM I was looking out my bedroom window to see if any planes were heading to PDX airport, and off to the east by southeast I saw a light through the trees so I moved to a different window and saw four bright lights coming toward the airport, I thought.  I can see planes around that time of night and when they have their headlights on they appear as only one light instead of two.  These were unusual in that I have never seen 4 lights (planes) that close together.  One was ahead and then two, one above the other, and then the fourth appeared to be behind the other 3.  They seemed to be moving fairly rapidly toward the airport and I figured that three of them would have to circle to await their turn to land. As I watched, the lights appeared to stop moving toward the west so I thought they had probably turned enough toward my viewpoint that their forward progress wouldn’t be visible to me.  Then, suddenly they all four went out.  I watched for awhile longer to see if those four planes landed and I saw at least one other plane go into the landing route and then a second but they were coming from the south and were not anywhere near where I had seen those other four lights. I thought it strange that those four planes had not landed and I didn’t see any other lights to indicate where they had gone and since my husband was asleep, I figured I’d tell him the next day.   Then Friday night on the 11 PM news the reporter told about some UFO’s sightings in the Vancouver area and the full story would be in Vancouver’s paper on Saturday.   That reminded me as I’d forgotten to tell my husband.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

They seemed to be pulsating slightly. not helicopters. not planes!  They don’t seem right!  There is no sound! Balloons?  Not with that glow! What could move like that?   Each disappeared one by one at the front end.  There were a few wispy clouds behind them so we figured they had to be about 3 to 4 miles away and over East Vancouver.  They seemed to be sort of floating (but not bobbing) in a loose formation - a C shape.   I ran back to grab my cell phone and managed to take 4 shots.  the things were all gone after two to three minutes!  I mailed the photos to my email and looked at them on the computer. The photos on the computer were disappointing because the lights looked so tiny and the sky was so black. They just looked like stars. I had not thought of shooting video at the moment. I was able to lighten the entire photo to show them up. I sent a text with photos to two local news stations - no answer this weekend. I googled unusual sightings. I noticed that there are a few videos and photos that seem like hoaxes, but many more looked and sounded exactly like ours. Words used in the videos we found were exactly in our conversation: what are they? this is weird no sound red lights pinkish lights orange lights floating moving slow formation blinked out disappeared one by one pulsating;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

This light was brighter then any other light in the sky at the time even the moon.  I watched for about 10 to 15 seconds to see if I could see any blinking lights like a aircraft would have.  During that time I observed it moving at a slow pace from south to north while dimming in brightness.  As I had to look down at the ground as I was walking to another position because of a bad ankle all of a second when I looked back at the same area it was gone.  I would say it was at a very high altitude traveling a little slower then a plane would travel as far as the dimming it was very bright when I first saw it then by the last time I saw it, it had dimmed to about as bright as a normal star in the city lights.  It  seems as if the dimming coincided maybe with the fact that it was gaining elevation now that I think about it as it did also get smaller.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

2 lights alternating from blue to red moving strangely for about 10 minutes in night sky.;2013-08-13 21:45:00;10 minutes;2 lights alternating from blue to red moving strangely for about 10 minutes in night sky At approximately 9:45 pm tonight (about 10 minutes ago), August 13, 2013 in east Vancouver WA this occurred.   I went outside to smoke and saw a bluish colored light in the distant sky moving at a high rate of speed north and then abruptly change direction 180 degrees, just above my neighbors house across the street between the trees.  So I ran out to the road and moved south down the road about 20 feet to get a better view of the light.  It was moving back and forth, at first I thought maybe it was a helicopter.   However, I then spotted a second red light just below it (about a ½ a hands width) and they were moving like they were sparing.  The two lights would occasionally change from blue to red and then back again.  Several times they would suddenly drop about one hand width (at arms length) then change color from red to blue and then go straight up one to two hand widths.  They continued this “dance” for several minutes.   My neighbor pulled up in his car and I yelled at him to come look at this.  He saw them also and didn’t know that they were.  At about 8 minutes from seeing the first one the second one that appeared (red initially) disappeared below the horizon (neighbors 1 story roof) and the second one moved north behind the trees.  The whole thing lasted approximately 10 minutes.  I have never seen anything like this. There were no sounds, they appeared to be several miles away and they were only blue and red, alternating at random times.  They moved with a combination of high speeds and low speeds in all directions.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Blue and red blinking light flying strangely in the sky.;2014-02-28 22:45:00;2 minutes;Blue and red blinking light flying strangely in the sky. At a distance, I noticed a rapidly blinking blue and red light in the sky.  I observed it for a couple of minutes before it went beyond the tree line.  Its motion was very fluid and it changed directions frequently and quickly.  It would blink very rapidly and alternately vanish/go dark for brief periods over and over.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Fleets of Star or Light Crafts Seen Flying Over Vancouver, WA, on 3/14/2014.;2014-03-15 00:00:00;~3 hours;Fleets of Star or Light Crafts Seen Flying Over Vancouver, WA, on 3/14/2014. Last night, I observed a bunch of UFO's over my house.  I'm really glad that I decided to write down what I saw last night as it was happening...  I couldn't get good pics or video & wanted to make sure I was actually seeing what I saw...  So, I just kind of started writing out what I was seeing & doing just to know I would remember this night!   Later, I tried talking myself out of what I saw throughout the night, & next morning, but I'm sure what I saw was real & when I read my description from last night, I realized that I can't talk myself out of it anymore...   So I'm submitting my notes from last night that describe the entire event.  It's mostly chronological so it's how it was unfolding.  I left it all in, even a few of my personal feelings about some of the things going on. I started writing about 5 minutes after I first saw the UFO's in the sky.  At about 12:15pm, yesterday on Friday night, March 14, 2014:  - Seeing a fleet of UFO's fly over my house right now!  Omg!  They look like seeing tiny stars or satellites.  Like when watching a satellite from space go thru the sky, except not blinking or twinkling, just solid.  There are WAY too many to be a satellite or even a group of satellites...even if somehow all these satellites could be up there at once.  But I've never seen anything like this before!  I was looking up at the sky tonight while walking my dog.  I walk my dog every night & I like to sky watch while I walk.  I was staring at what I think was Jupiter because I was thinking how big & red the Star looked, & when I realized it wasn't twinkling I figured it must be a planet...  Then I noticed that some of the stars were moving!  I had to do a double take & then said those are really moving!!  All white in color like a white star looks & they are all the same exact size of a small star & about as bright.  At first I saw about 5-7 & then more.  Then I'd see only a few, then 10-20 or so more staggered thru...  A lot of them are flying exactly parallel with another one (craft/light).  But not all of them do.  They are flying kind of slowly & are staying around the same pace, but not all in one group.  They are all over this section of sky near the moon, but not in other areas of the sky... I can see them through the clouds & above/below them as well.  I can also see them when there are no cloud in the sky bear the moon.  They are all flying across the sky near the moon going from what I think to be East - West but it looks like they are going towards the PDX airport which is South of Vancouver.  I will have to confirm the directions I am looking. They are going very slowly across the sky still.  They are flying with no trails of light, contrails or any other obvious features.  Since I couldn't get my husband to come & look (he was sleeping) I am desperate to have somebody witness what I am seeing!  First, I just called my mom to see if she could see what I was seeing, but she said she couldn't see anything, which I kind of figured because she's across town.  Then I decided to call 911... I felt kind of stupid after I started telling him about what I'm seeing!  Like I said sorry!  I'm not sure what I thought you could do for me!  Lol... At that point I asked, but he hadn't gotten any other calls about anything strange in the sky, but he did give me the State UFO hotline phone #, which was really nice of him & that made me feel better, lol... So I called & I left a message with the hotline he gave me & I also called MUFON... I didn't get anyone live, but it was 1am!  I don't really expect anyone waiting by the phone!  I guess I just really want to tell someone what I'm seeing!  It's frustrating to be seeing this alone!!  I've tried to take pictures & video but I can't see anything on the screens!  I think they are too small to see with my crappy camera...  I'll have to check later on my computer if any came out, but I only have my phone & an older camcorder that was dead, so I got an extension cord & drug it out the front window towards the front yard/driveway where I have been standing all night, so I could plug the camera in & try to film something.  I couldn't zoom in on anything because the lights were very tiny like stars & the moon was pretty full & bright & that's all my camera would focus on...  Argh!  This sucks!!  It's now 1:15am.  Been seeing them from around midnight till now, at least over an hour so far. Reminds me of the videos you see on Youtube that show little fleets of tiny crafts flying & zipping around the atmosphere, except these ones I see are much slower...  Kind of a cautious pace.  Not sure if each dot is singular or just visible lights on a larger ship that isn't completely visible....?  They keep coming pretty steadily...  By the end of this night I think there could be 50+ ships at the very least... I'm sure I can't even see them all.  Can't seem to get them on camera but have to check the pics/vid later to be sure... Can't get bobby to help me verify this... It really pisses me off!  How can you not want to come & look if your wife tells you they see weird lights in the sky that you think could be UFO's?!  He said I must be seeing stars!  Yeah... ok Copernicus!  Stars don't move like that!  These are definitely not stars.  Not like I've ever seen in my 31 years!  He's not really much into science or astronomy... things like that, but jeez! I love the night sky & I watch it nightly... I am familiar with normal activity, but this wasn't normal at all...!  Tomorrow I will take pics of my area during the day in case anyone is wondering.  This is pretty much the biggest thing that's ever happened as far as something like this goes & I really can't believe what I'm seeing...even though it's right in front of me!  I've always thought there was other life out there...  But seeing this is life changing! I've been out here for about 2 hours watching the sky... I can't imagine I'd stare @ the sky for 3 hours for no reason...  It's cold out here too! I'm chilled to the bone!  And I'm 10 feet from my house!  Duh!  Go inside, lol!!  Just now about 1:30am now, while watching the sky I see an extra bright one paired with the reg. dimmer version that I have seen the whole time with it...  Haven't seen one this bright...! Then the 2 seemed to stop. A plane was flying nearby with only reddish blinking lights & a small dissipating contrail.  It flew by (not sure of actual distance) the stopped star crafts & they didn't move...  At the same moment I started watching 3 others little reg. star crafts come in rather faster than normal.  One was even trying to catch up... then they seemed to stop as well...  Thats when the plane that kept flying by before, with the red lights, went by them just after they too had stopped - I thought maybe the crafts try & disguise themselves as stars? They were directly over head... 1:41am. So now I don't know what I'm seeing... It is really weird! None of them had stopped before.  I tried staring at the 3 that stopped for a long time to see if they would move so I could believe that my eyes were just messing with me...  But they didn't budge.  I know what I saw. I even saw the last of the 3 trying to catch up with the other 2 before they stopped.  Same with the bright one & the reg. one that I saw just before. I clearly saw them move from out in the distance & then stop.  But when I see them still there it's hard to say it was them, but maybe that's why they do it?  It's the only aspect of what I've seen tonight that is hard to explain...  Aside from seeing UFO's in general of course!!  This is what I've seen & it really makes me wonder where they came from & where they were headed.... (Completely sober tonight by the way...lol.)

Weird star like light heading west from east, possibly a second one.;2014-08-24 21:30:00;several hours;Weird star like light heading west from east, possibly a second one. I was sitting around a campfire with a neighbor, when we saw something moving across the sky heading west from east.  It had weird movements, as it would have semicircle movements at some points, straight line at others.  Once it got close to directly overhead, it had a habit of just staying in place.  It seemed like any of the stars, with nothing remarkable.  I tried to record it with my iPhone, but not even the campfire was showing on the trees(light from the campfire.  Trees were not on fire. Just making sure). We were dumbstruck on what it could be.  I tried to rationalize it every way I could.  I'm an avid amateur astronomer and a total fan of physics in all it's forms.  I could not find an explanation. I tried to think as it moved, if it could be a satellite.  But to my knowledge, a satellite does not have sudden stops in movement.  I then tried to think weather balloon.  But a weather balloon wouldn't be visible even at the maximum height it could achieve at that time of night.  I then figured maybe a weird hyper-velocity star.  But to no avail, I could not rationalize anything about it. I tried blurring my eyes to pin-point what kind of light source.  At one point, I could pick out a total of three light sources from the one source of light.  At one point, seemed as a light source came from it and faded away.  Then another light source(one west and one SSW[being the second one]) came into view.  Once the second one was visible, both came to a sort of full stop.  They made movements, but never left the spot.  They stayed there up until I grew tired of watching them (23:15), and are probably still there since I came inside.   The movements even when they were relatively in one spot just seemed weird.  It'd be weird semicircles and full circles, but not covering much distance.  Sometimes would move different directions, but same area. I've seen a couple of strange things in the past, but this is a new pattern I saw.  Usually they disappear after a certain point.  I've never seen anything move so fast and cover so much space, to just stay at one point.  I have no explanation for what I saw.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Orange orbs seen in southeast sky over Vancouver WA on New Years Eve at about 10:15pm;2014-12-31 22:15:00;15 minutes;Orange orbs seen in southeast sky over Vancouver WA on New Years Eve at about 10:15pm It was on New Year’s Eve 2014 at about 10:15pm.  I went outside in the back yard to walk next door.  My son was over at the neighbor.   It was a clear night and as I stepped out in the back yard, I looked up in the southeast sky and saw one orange orb like light that hardly moved.  I could only tell it was moving because of one bright star off to the left of the orange light.  It was not blinking there was no noise of a plane or other aircraft.   Then about 30 seconds the light disappeared.  Immediately after the first one disappeared another orange like orb formed slightly to the left and down from where I saw the first light.  This one moved in the same manner as the first but after about 40 seconds it too disappeared.  Then two more orange orbs appeared.  I was trying to get the attention of my neighbor and his girlfriend and my two boys.  Then the girlfriend came out and saw the two orbs and asked said, “What the heck is that?”  Then my two boys and neighbor all came out and we watched this go on orbs appearing and disappearing for about 2 more minutes.   Then 3 orbs appeared into a tangier shape, and moved from east to west. Then one orb went out leaving two which seemed to move faster than the others but not by much.  Then the other two disappeared.   Before all three disappeared, I had got my other neighbor to see what we were seeing and he was really not sure what to think.  Then another one showed up but more off to the right from the others.  This one seemed to be the same size but appeared to change colors like red, green and blue and kind of was spinning.   Then that went away and one last smaller orb showed up to the left of the colorful one and then went away. Then there was no more light or orbs.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Singular light followed by multiple surrounding lights and large shadows/sounds.  Focused over Vancouver Lake.;2015-03-24 01:30:00;ongoing;Singular light followed by multiple surrounding lights and large shadows/sounds.  Focused over Vancouver Lake. There are lights hovering over Vancouver Lake in Vancouver, WA.  Roughly 800 ft in the air.   I was thinking to myself when I looked out my window and noticed a large amount of fog.  But it was all focused on one major area, I focused as well as I could on that area, and noticed a slowly rising cluster of lights (as if it all belonged to one vessel), flashing around.  I then noticed multiple flashes of light around the singular cluster, as if it were firing upon something.   I then started to notice EXTREMELY large shadows in the dense fog around my house, and I am right now, hiding in my house, hearing large noises of unknown origin outside my window.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Flashing red light moving fast and erratic.;2015-09-27 20:00:00;5 minutes;Flashing red light moving fast and erratic. On September 27th at 8:00 pm my daughter was on our back deck looking west when she noticed a red ball of light moving in different directions and she yelled at me to come and see what she was watching.  When I went out, I witnessed a red flashing ball of light move upward in the sky rather quickly and then stop and stay in place briefly.  It then moved back down and moved to the right at a fast speed and again stopping for a moment. It then moved to the left but this time moving slower and the flashing red light then pulsated quicker about 6 times.  Also during this time a plane was flying towards it moving opposite direction than it was and at a  different altitude passing  each other.  Then, once again it paused and then moved right again moving quickly and then moving out of my site behind trees and not seen after that.  This was witnessed for about 5 minutes.  This was not a plane.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Red and Green lights zig-zag in East Vancouver on Oct. 23, 2015.;2015-10-23 20:02:00;1-2 minutes;Red and Green lights zig-zag in East Vancouver on Oct. 23, 2015 8:02 PM OCTOBER 23, 2015, Vancouver, Washington  I had just come home from an errand, and was standing at the end of my driveway.  I happened to look up at the moon, which was just above the roof of my house to the south.  It was about ¾ full, with a few wisps of clouds around it.  It was developing a ring around its perimeter. Just to the left of the moon, I noticed two lights - one green and one red - hovering high in the sky, about 10 degrees east of due south.  They were very bright and steady.  They almost looked like Christmas lights, but were too high in the sky to be that.  I initially thought they were from the jets landing at the Portland International Airport, because they were in that general direction, a little east from the airport.  But the lights weren’t moving.  They just hovered there for maybe a minute or so. They slowly started moving west, then suddenly, the lights zig-zagged right, then left very rapidly 2 or 3 times.  The object then turned and started coming toward me at a slower pace than it was when it was zig-zagging.  It seemed as if the object blinked and rotated at the same time, and the lights turned from red and green to white.  I couldn’t be sure, but I had the impression it was disc-shaped.  Suddenly, the light went straight down toward the ground, leaving a long, solid streak of yellowish-white light behind.  I lost sight of it as it disappeared behind the house.  I went out back, but could see nothing.  I did not hear any sounds during this incident. I watched for awhile, and saw several planes coming in and out of the airport.  They moved in a steady line toward and away from the airport, not in the crazy zig-zag way of the object.  I walked down the block where there was a less obstructed view of the southern sky, but could see nothing.  After coming in and looking up UFO sightings online, I found several stories from “The Columbian” newspaper in Vancouver.  It described sightings nights on Feb. 20 and 21 2011 when several residents in the Clear Meadows neighborhood of East Vancouver saw something very similar to what I saw.  There was some speculation that what they saw was a Chinese kite decked out with LED lights that was flown by a man named Mike.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

8/14/16 @ 1:56am.  Orange glowing ball disappears, re appeared and disappears again in Vancouver sky. Total time 1min.;2016-08-14 01:57:00;2× 1/2 min...60 sec total;8/14/16 @ 1:56am  Orange glowing ball disappears, re-appeared and disappears again in Vancouver sky.  Total time 1min. I was doing a late night stroll on 8/14/16.  I noticed off to my left an orange/red ball of light in the sky.  It was well above the tree and house lines on the opposite side of the street and there was nothing to obstruct my view.  It was 1:56am and I was looking in southern direction.  Towards Portland, Oregon, from Vancouver, Washington. Right away, I noticed something different about the light.  It was it's glow.  It was like a light orange at the center and grew a bit darker moving from center to outer edges.  Where it was more of a redish color.  There was also a blinking, or some kind of flashing.  It was rhythmic in sequence, but it was of the same color as the orb.  The light did not illuminate any distinguishable features.  The light was large.  Imagine holding a match head at arms length, that's about how big it looked to me.  I would roughly estimate it being 5 to 10 miles away. It was moving in a flat, arc like pattern.  From the west to east, then finally heading south. After it was heading what looked like south, for about 3 seconds.  It grew dim real fast then blinked out of existence.  For a moment, I thought it might be a plane. Because of its flight pattern and the fact that the Portland airport lies just south west from where I saw it.  Yet, there were no other light markers on it.  No green and white flashing lights.  No landing/takeoff lights or the tall tale pattern of said lights.  This glowin, orange ball had no defining mark or any light source. At 1:57 I texted my friend to see if he was awake....nope. At 1:59 it re appeared. This time I had phone in hand and got some video. During it's second run. The light just appeared out of nowhere.  It moved from east to west. Then quickly back in the easterly direction. Where it stopped in mid flight and mid air. It danced around a bit. It popped up, then down, then it jutted to the west and slowly moved back to its original spot.  At this time, it looked as though it was moving south again. Because after a couple of seconds it dimmed in brightness rather fast, then blinked 2 or 3 times like before and gone!  There was no chance of it being a helicopter.  Like the plane, there were no external light markers.  It moved to fast and too random for it to be a helicopter.  Not to mention the whole orange glow as well as it appearing out of nowhere. I have also given thought to its departures. With the whole light dimming, then blinking out. No plane or helicopter could move so fast that you would loose sight of it. Especially one as bright as the ball I witnessed. It would take minutes for it to gradually fade from sgh. This ball went from a big, bright, glowing orb to nothing in 3 seconds.....two times did this. Unfortunately, like all lowlight/nighttime video, it came out not showing much. You can see what looks like a star, a white dwarf. The camera could not pick up its orange glow and without it, it was considerably smaller. Yet, it was much larger and brighter than the North Star. But the camera was having a hard time focusing on it. Something else I noticed,  it was the difference in shape between what I saw with the naked eye and what the camera was able to detect. With the naked eye, the object (or shape of the glow if you will) was not necessarily round. It was more cylindrical, a shape more like a soda can. There was no source to the glow, nor did that glow cast anylight upon itself. That being said, any defining details like silhouette, shadows, outlines, etc were not present. I have no explanation for the shape it had with what I just said. It just had one. Now, looking through the eye of a camera, you see a perfectly round object. It was bright white in color. Not pure white, but a few shades off. It also flickered like a star. I can't be sure what was causing the flicker. Sometimes it looked like something on the object was pulsating. Sometimes it looked like it could be distortion caused by heat or gasses in the atmosphere. I have described this sighting the best I could. I have mulled over it for a bit , let it sink into my brain, chewed on it for a while and analyzed it from every angle.  I tend to believe nothing of what I hear and only half of what I see.  I have tried to debunk the video the best I could.  I have ruled out helicopters and any fixed wing aircraft.  A drone of sorts is possible, but unlikely. I hope this information is helpful.  Because I'm only a skeptic when it comes to finding the truth.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Brightly-lit bluish/white sphere, maneuvering at impossible speeds and in impossible angles to be an aircraft found on Earth..;2018-03-29 21:02:00;5 seconds;Brightly-lit bluish/white sphere, maneuvering at impossible speeds and in impossible angles to be an aircraft found on Earth.. Tonight [here] in Vancouver, Washington, we have an apparent full moon and a sporadic cloud-cover - where the stars are clear and highly visible in between the small puffy clouds lit up in the moonlight...   At approx. 9:00 am (for some reason) I stepped outside to look up into the evening sky towards the south -  which would be in the direction of East Portland, Oregon (located approx. 5-miles across the Columbia River from where we live)...  While gazing up into that direction (at an approx. 30 35-degrees above the horizon), I suddenly noticed a bright bluish/white sphere which appeared to swiftly leap over a small/isolated cloud in an up/over/and down type of arcing maneuver (while heading from a northerly position, and then towards the south, as if to hide from my view behind the cloud)...   Approximately 2 or 3 seconds later, and to my shock & amazement, the brightly-lit bluish/white sphere (again) suddenly reappeared from behind the same isolated cloud, and then it leapt back over it in the same exact arcing type maneuver as before, only this time heading towards my direction (to the north from its southerly position from behind the cloud)...   The sphere [then] winked out completely in an instant after retaining the initial position where it had first lit itself up from the north side of the small isolated cloud that was involved in this sighting...  The aerial maneuvers that this illuminating sphere had displayed to me were definitely not of any known earthly aircraft found in today's world...  I somehow got the feeling that the light had an intelligence inside of it which was controlling its maneuverability, and that when the sphere had suddenly reversed its direction towards me (in a swift/leaping upwards-then-downwards arc), that it knew that I had spotted it, and that it was merely showing-off its seemingly impossible capabilities to satisfy my lifelong fascination & curiosity for this type of phenomena.! ..   I am 60-years old now, and tonight's otherworldly aerial display chalks itself up to be my 4th UFO sighting thus to date.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

They were about the size of a street light as seen from a block away.  They  disappeared in a few minutes heading South East.

Still watching, it started to “what looked like” turn left very slowly and started moving upwards into the sky and then just vanished...
