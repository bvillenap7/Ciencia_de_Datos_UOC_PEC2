I was laying outside stargazing when I saw a triangular formation of light moving as one.;2003-07-28 23:32:00;5 Minutes;I was laying outside stargazing when I saw a triangular formation of light moving as one. I was laying outside stargazing when I saw what appeared to be three stars in a triangular formation moving to the southeast. It was difficult to judge the size, speed, and the alltitude of the craft. I then quickly ran upstairs tripping at the last step shouting to my mom and sister,A UFO!A UFO!. I then ran back outside by then my brother had waken up and went outside(my dad was away on business). I then spotted the craft moving at the same speed and in the same direction. The rest of my family was able to pick it out of the starry sky. Near the end of the siting I could actually see a small, faint outline beetween the three points of lights. We followed it until it was 3/4 of the way across the sky it then started to vanish. This was one truly AMAZING siting.

April 29, 2006: 3 black trangles observed flying slowly east over Vancouver, WA. Time 13:55-14:05.;2006-04-29 13:55:00;:10;April 29, 2006: 3 black trangles observed flying slowly east over Vancouver, WA. Time 13:55-14:05. Overview:  Shortly after finishing an outdoor lunch with my wife and son, my son noticed something in the sky and asked me what they were.  I looked up to the sky in the direction he was pointing.  What I saw were three triangle shaped black objects moving very slowly across the sky in a easterly direction.  I called out to my wife, who had taken a few dishes into the house, to hurry outside and take a look at these things.  My wife came outside, looked up to where my son and I were looking and also observed the three flying objects.  My son ran into the house and brought out our digital camera but said that he could not find the objects in the view-finder of the camera.  I then ran into the house to get our binoculars but could not find them so I returned outside, and together we observed the black triangles drift across the the sky untill they entered the clouds.  Facts:   We observed the objects for about ten minutes from 13:55 to 14:05 local time (PDT).  The objects were triangle in shape, and black in color with no lights observed.  They were moving in a kind of formation (two close together and the other one by itself).  We did not hear any sound coming from the at all.  Sky cover was completly overcast with a cumulo-stratus cloud layer at about 3000 to 3500 feet above ground level.  The objects were clearly visible against the clouded background.  I am 100% sure that these objects were not airplanes (unless top secret), they were not helicopters, ballons, kites, birds, or blimps.

UFO sighting Vancouver, WA December 5th, 2010.;2010-12-05 19:00:00;half hour;UFO sighting Vancouver, WA December 5th, 2010. My mother and I were driving East on SR 500, and we stopped at the light on Stapleton Avenue when we noticed several planes flying in very (very) close proximity to one another, which we both thought was odd. It was dusk, but there was still an inkling of light left in the sky.  I pointed out that they were very bright, and were traveling oddly slow, and I noticed a familiar formation I had seen in some UFO conspiracy videos. rying not to be immediately critical, we both concentrated on them for another moment when all of a sudden, another appeared as if a light had just been turned on in the sky. We were both so shocked by the way it appeared, we were screaming in the car. At the time, it was nearing the end of rush hour, but there was still a good amount of traffic. We looked around to see if anyone else had noticed, when the traffic light turned green. We drove home quickly and brought our friend out to see the lights in the sky. He agreed that, there was a lot of air traffic in such a small area of the sky. We had never seen airplanes fly this closely together, unless they were in a USO show. As most of them very slowly faded south/southwest, one or two of them came almost directly overhead of us, just about one or two miles north. From there we could make out five bright lights on the bottom side of one of them, one in the front, and two sets of two behind that, in an A or V shape. We also all noticed it made little or no noise, although it was somewhat blustery that day, so we didn't think it was TOO strange, but just a little. Either way, we were all very shocked by what we saw, and we still can't explain anything we saw that day, besides saying they were definitely NOT airplanes. Also, curious to see if there were any reports, we found a news report from that same day, just hours before in Nixa, Missouri, saying they also saw something strange in the background of a report that had been given.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXlJM9dOE4.  Their explanation at the very end is not convincing though.  We are still baffled.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

UFO in Vancouver, WA;2012-09-07 21:46:00;about 4 minutes;UFO in Vancouver, WA I was outside and saw a blue light in the sky.  It was off to the east and seemed to be coming towards me.  The light started turning colors (red, blue, white, green) and was very bright.  As it flew closer I could tell it was not an aircraft by the way it was moving.  It would fly north, come to a complete stop and go the opposite direction.  I ran inside to get my roommate so she could see it too.  When we got back outside the objest was directly overhead.  There were three round, yellow lights shaped like a triangle.  It had a beam of light coming out if it in a straight line that changed colors.  We watched the light for about another 2 minutes as it manouvered around the sky and changed shape and colors before it disappeared behind a tree.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Heavily populated area with incoming and outbound aircraft from the airport, UFO objects overhead, and visible to witnesses.;2012-11-15 17:30:00;1 minute;Heavily populated area with incoming and outbound aircraft from the airport, UFO objects overhead, and visible to witnesses. A friend and I were traveling 60 mph, going west on SR-500 in Vancouver.  1/4th of a mile before the I-5 on ramp going North.  We spotted objects that had several bright lights.  They were in the sky directly in front of us.  In the distance  at a glance they looked like aircraft, but not airplanes.  They were lined up too close and moving too slow to be incoming airplanes, they almost seemed to be hovering very low above downtown Vancouver, WA.   As we approached our freeway on ramp,the biggest craft went over the top of us and was literally less than 100 yards directly south of the Driver side window, we were able to watch as it passed over the front/ top of us and lowered almost to ground level.  It was very big triangle shaped, as it lowered it seemed to be slowly rotating, so we saw the underside of it.  It was grey, metallic looking almost liquid.    The light configuration was strange, there were several very bright lights that seemed to run along the bottom with brighter bigger lights on the corners of the bottom of the craft.   There were several other similar objects in the sky immediately in front of us, we were on the freeway and had to turn and head north and the sky is not visible from where we are in Vancouver.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

No sound, some wavering of both color and trajectory along its path.
