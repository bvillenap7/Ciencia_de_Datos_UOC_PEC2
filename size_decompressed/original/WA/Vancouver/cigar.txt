single white, cigar shaped object over west Vanouver, WA;2011-10-25 13:10:00;1 minute;single white, cigar shaped object over west Vanouver, WA 1 white cigar shaped object spotted over west Vancouver, WA.  Object was stationary against a clear blue sky.  It was too low, large and stationary to be an aircraft.  I was a passenger in a vehicle traveling north on I-5 near mile 2 and saw it in the western sky at approximately 1:10 pm PST.  I lost view of it after just a minute when an embankment blocked my view.  Just moments later, the view was clear and the object was gone.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Extraordinarily bright, metallic, cigar shaped object moving with unchanging speed and direction disappears into trees.;2020-07-31 16:00:00;20 seconds;Extraordinarily bright, metallic, cigar shaped object moving with unchanging speed and direction disappears into trees. My wife and I were driving East with traffic on SR-14 towards Camas, Washington.  During the sighting I noticed the truck behind me swerve onto the emergency lane, then re-enter traffic after the objects disappeared.  I assume he was seeing the same thing we were. I noticed two cigar shaped objects at the same moment.  One looked metallic, the other was metallic and extraordinarily bright.  One traveling North to South, and the bright object traveling South to North.  They were in almost the same location to begin with but when they separated, my eyes tracked the bright object until it was out of sight.  I then looked South for the metallic object, but it was gone. I alerted my wife to the bright object moving North, she did not see the metallic object moving South.  She was able to observe the bright object until what she described as the object disappearing as it entered the tops of the trees.  That area is a heavily wooded hillside.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Oblong white light travelling west to east slowly in northern sky's of Vancouver, Washington;2021-05-15 22:35:00;1-3 minutes;Oblong white light travelling west to east slowly in northern sky's of Vancouver, Washington Around 10:30pm my daughter, age 20 called me and had told me to come outside there was something weird in the sky. Once outside I had witnessed with Her a oblong white thing traveling at a fairly slow speed from the west to the east in the sky north of our position. It was fairly large, I would say it's length was about that of a dime held up at arm's length, fairly thin and was white against the night sky, not super bright. There were times it seemed to be a little brighter but not much so I am not certain if that was the case or it was just my eyes, it was not at any point bright enough to capture on a cell phone for a video. It was horizontal in the sky and we witnessed it until we could no longer see it because its view had been obstructed by trees, I had witnessed it for approximately a minute to a minute and a half and my daughter had witnessed it approximately two to three minutes.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
