The three crafts where heading from the south,very high altitude,towards Seattle,,Madigan. Lead aircraft had not lights,,,chase plane had white flashing lights. Thought you might be interested.

the craft seemed very large,and had simeltaneous flashing red lights,all in a straight line.;2002-09-18 20:07:00;5 min;the craft seemed very large,and had simeltaneous flashing red lights,all in a straight line. about 8:06 pm on sept 17,2002,i got a call from a friend telling me to go outside,she was kind of frantic.She said there was something in the sky to the northwest.as i looked up i saw a long,lighted craft,looking at the distance i was appeared to be about 4-5 inches,there was no sound.as i was on the phone w/her it began to break up and buzz.i called 911,and they gave me the number to the ufo hotline.I explained to the man i was speaking with,that it was oblong(from my veiw)and had a line of flashing red lights,and it was moving in an odd manner(not like a conventional aircraft)rather up and down.i and my daughter watched for about 5 minutes as it moved to the northwest,and dissapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and with her son, and both of them sounded quite credible.  We are awaiting illustrations from both witnesses.  Please see other report from Seattle for this date.  We believe the correct date for the sighting is September 18, 2002, the night they called our Center.  PD));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Odd shaped aircraft;2009-07-08 16:28:00;10 second;Odd shaped aircraft I stepped outside to shoot a few hoops and as I was walking down my driveway I noticed an oddly shaped craft up in the sky. At first I thought it was a plane since I live near PDX but i soon realized it was not a commercial plane. It was also just sitting there up in the air, and that wasn't right either. All of a sudden it just disappeared. The way it was shaped was there was a long rectangle. Down at the bottom of the rectangle there were two circles, one on each side. Then at the top there was a half circle.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Bright orb and strange craft flying over Vancouver, Wa;2012-10-03 17:15:00;20 minutes;Bright orb and strange craft flying over Vancouver, Wa My two teenage boys and I were sitting in living room watching tv and there was a bright, sporadic blinking white light (big) that flew low and above our house - I'm still shaking I'm so amazed, it flew away in a straight line then sideways then down, maybe a couple miles away where it hovered for about ten minutes.  Then it disappeared.   But before it did, we saw 3 more crafts that came after it am followed in that same direction.    At first glance they looked like planes but they flew so close we could see their pentagon type of shape and there was ZERO sound. Planes make sound, these were completely silent!!    I have never posted on a sight like this before.  I truly can't believe what just happened.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Took awhile for me to grab my camera as I was thinking “No Way”.;2015-06-27 13:20:00;15-30 minutes;took awhile for me to grab my camera as I was thinking “No Way”. fairly slow lumbering flight path east to west then finally west to east and I look away for just a bit then it was not in sight.  (went above clouds I presume) at one point when I noted the Very distant  V shape (as in that typed letter) it did a slow rotation or 2 while hovering in one spot.  Color:  good   question I saw it as black and or possibly orange/white – perhaps due to sun reflections on it??  Other witness when she finally came out side said black. it did a 2nd hovering after I believe it was when it went from west to east. when I first saw it I thought it was an airplane in the distance.    then possibly   drone, or hang glider or something..  that broke free and was floating around. but it went against the cloud direction when it went east to west. and it was too far away and too high up to start with from initial sighting to farthest west sighting to be a Civilian RC or drone.  its Sharp V shape would not be of Any benefit to the slow speed and hovering it did. there may be little more I can say or not   I did not grab my camera when it was in the position of best view.. then I put the first battery in it and it did not work..  (rechargeable and stored charged even)    Ignore the pictures timestamp I don’t keep batteries in my camera and seldom use it. time taken I can calculate it if needed but just hoping others reported the same thing.  or an explanation    -  Please fill me in. the picture does not look at all like what I saw.  I saw no lights or anything. when it hovered and rotated.  I simply saw a   “V”    just about like that one. cannon eos 40D 28-135  AF   IS. if needed please use my email to contact me   especially if there is an explanation or others that reported it. this is not a crack letter though I do expect there must be an explanation as I would liked to have seen something of this nature.  ( to Know ) and I am outside often looking up. Oh yea,   Vancouver Washington USA aprox 1-2 pm 6-27-2015  ( sober ) thanks;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

White Star Fell To Earth, Then Became A Golden Glowing Sphere;2018-09-05 01:00:00;1 minute;White Star &quotFell To Earth,&quot Then Became A Golden Glowing Sphere Was sometime around 1 in the morning, facing North . I was looking outside my window at some other strange objects in the distance, when I noticed what appeared to be one of the stars get closer, as if it was falling to earth.  There was a shooting star nearby it for a second.  Then, this object glowed into a golden entity that could possibly even have been some sort of a celestial being moved toward the East slowly, and then effortlessly glided across the sky.  Reality seemed to ripple around this object.  Even Stars appeared to get out of its way as it moved.  Felt good to watch it, as if I'd been waiting my whole life to see it.  Ran outside my house to chase after it, but by that point it was gone.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Huge flashes of color lighting up the sky almost like a nuke went off but no mushroom cloud and it was colorful.;2018-12-12 00:40:00;About 10 seconds;Huge flashes of color lighting up the sky almost like a nuke went off but no mushroom cloud and it was colorful. I did not see a UFO but a huge flash of blue that lit up most of the sky, like a bright baby blue, but it wasn't like a lighting flash it was more like a sunset in which the whole sky is lit up evenly, there seemed to be no source of the light, it looked as if the sky just changed colors. The flash lasted longer then lighting but was still fairly quick. After the first flash I paused my TV show and drew my full attention looking out the window. About 3-4 seconds after the first flash a second flash of orange lit up the sky. The third and final flash seemed to be a weird combination of orange and blue with a little purple, that is my closest description I am not sure it really didn't look like any color I have seen before. I dont know what the hell it was, the closet thing I could think of was that it looked like was a nuke went off just without the mushroom cloud and colorful. I know this website is for UFO sightings but I've scoured the internet for almost ! a year now and have found now similar reporting of this in my town and its starting to drive me a little crazy so if anyone else has seen this please let me know.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Craft moving silently across a cloudless night sky. Appeared almost like distortion in the sky.;2020-05-09 22:35:00;~20-30 seconds;Craft moving silently across a cloudless night sky. Appeared almost like distortion in the sky. My parents and I were sitting out on their patio enjoying the night.  My parents and I are all sound of mind and don't do any drugs and had not been drinking.  At one point I looked up to observe the stars above us and noticed a an object that appeared to be shaped like a Lima bean or V slowly moving across the cloudless night sky.  It seemed to be transparent or at least very similar color to the night sky.  I immediately said that there was something moving, my dad looked up and was able to point the general area of the object.  Which I take as confirmation that I was indeed seeing something.  (My mom also saw it after we pointed it out to her).  It was moving silently and had no lights, flashing or otherwise, it also had no tail like a comet would.  It just looked like a bit of distortion or haze in the sky, but the shape had to perfect of a shape to be gas or something of the like.  It was moving in a Southward direction at about the speed of a commer! cial airplane.  I don't recall if it passed in front of the view of any stars.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
