I when an got a pair of 7X50 and was just ajusting them whe off to the right of the Moon I saw this RED and WHITE strobing light. The light was jumping around and I figured that it was just me, so I when to my car that was in the driveway and used it for a stedy rest for the 7X50s.

The ligh was high up and bright in the 7X50s;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
