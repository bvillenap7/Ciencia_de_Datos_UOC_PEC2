I thought it was a star;1999-09-14 22:00:00;1 minute;I thought it was a star out on my deck looking at the stars, suddenly one started moving at a steady pace from south to north, no blinking lights, followed it until out of sight remained looking like a star,no colors.no twinkle. then it just disappeared,I thought maybe it was a sattalite,but not sure.We are in a flight path from PDX in Portland so am aware what airplanes look like. this was too high for an airplane, it remained as high as the stars look from the ground.I saw none of the characteristics you have listed. would it be possible to e-mail me at ((address deleted)) @aol.com. this is very puzzling to me. thank you, ((name deleted));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
2 diamond shaped craft, each with 6 glowing red lights on the bottom of the craft were viewed for approx. 20 seconds;2001-01-06 03:00:00;20 seconds;2 diamond shaped craft, each with 6 glowing red lights on the bottom of the craft were viewed for approx. 20 seconds The two caft were diamnod shaped and were flying in a northwesterly direction toward the ocen. They appearred to have six red lights or red glowing power sources on the bottom of the craft. Initially they flew in a horizontal pattern with the red glowing portion parallel to the ground similar to what one would see with a military aircraft with afterburners on. The craft then stopped abruptly and turned 90 degrees so the the afterburners were facing downward toward the ground. The craft were lost from view when the went behind a hill.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Diamond shaped object flying.;2017-05-21 19:44:00;<1 minute;Diamond shaped object flying. Diamond-like shaped object flying around 1500 ft. from North to South.  Sun reflected off the object.  Approximately fifty miles per hour.  It stopped at one point and hovered and then moved on in the same direction going south.

We saw 2 diamond shaped, low flying, stationary, soundless, bright white lights driving North on I5 from Vancouver.;2020-03-18 20:30:00;15 minutes;We saw 2 diamond shaped, low flying, stationary, soundless, bright white lights driving North on I-5 from Vancouver. My significant other and I were driving North on I5 from Vancouver when we saw a large, low flying, stationary, bright white light in the sky directly above us. The light was in a sort of diamond shape but soft, no sharp edges to the light. There was no sound coming from it like an airplane or helicopter would have even though we drove under it and passed it. There were no visible wings or propellers and no flashing lights. Then, about 10-15 miles later we saw another one right above us that looked exactly the same. Again, no sound coming from it. We saw what looked like an airplane fly close to the second one then pass it. I'm not sure if it was some sort of military practice but it didn't look like a flare or lantern or any sort of known aircraft.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
