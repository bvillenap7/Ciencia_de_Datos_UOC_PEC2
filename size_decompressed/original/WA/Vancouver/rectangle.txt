The objects appeared as a shadow in the sky and perhaps the size of a small plane but did have some allumination but not brightly lit. They seemed to be rectangular in shape but hard to say for sure because of the darkness. It appeared that we were looking at the underbelly of the craft as they headed in a north westerly direction. There was no sound of any kind. The most unusual observation was the manner in which they moved. They zig-zaged and criss-crossed in a way we had never seen any aircraft manover before. As they  moved further away into the distance they appeared as a bright light, continued to zig-zag then disappeared in the horizon.

We are both 50 years old and feel like what we saw was out of the ordinary and unexplainable.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
((HOAX??))  verticle rectangle with several bright lights.;2008-07-08 01:30:00;:20 min.;verticle rectangle with several bright lights. From Vancouver, WA, looking south, on July 8,2008, 1:30 am PDT from my dining room window, I saw a vertical rectangle with several bright lights, during a very clear night sky, about 200 times larger than any star I have seen.  I watched for twenty minutes.  During that time there was no movement, other than a slight shimmering.  I then went back to bed. This is no joke.  I was wide awake at the time.

7 or 8 bright reddish-orange lighted, squarish or cubic shaped objects, hovering above the tree tops in a random pattern.;2012-11-10 18:25:00;2+ minutes;7 or 8 bright reddish-orange lighted, squarish or cubic shaped objects, hovering above the tree tops in a random pattern. I was traveling north on I-205 at approximately 6:25 or 6:30 p.m.  I just passed over NE 66th St. where some big power lines are located.  Above those lines, on the right side of the freeway, I noticed 7 or 8 glowing shapes.  They were reddish-orange and were more of a cube shape than rounded.  They seemed to be bobbing gently up and down.  They were not connected to each other and not in a straight line.  They were only about 50 feet above the top of the power lines.  I thought they were some kind of lantern or glowing balloons but couldn’t make out how they were connected to the ground or to each other because they all seemed to be independent of each other.  Other people were looking at them too….one car had stopped on the side of the road.  I was late for church so I couldn’t stop and study it more.  I did notice that they were stationary enough that I saw them before me and was able to pass them and look back at them when I went by.  I rolled down the c! ar window and there was no noticeable sound.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
