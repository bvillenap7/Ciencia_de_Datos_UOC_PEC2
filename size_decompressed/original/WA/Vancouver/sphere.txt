A bright light out my window.;1998-04-20 09:00:00;1 second;A bright light out my window. I was laying in bed at about 9:00 PM on a dark night. It was very cloudy but was not raining. I was listening to the radio, and trying to get to sleep when all of a sudden the radio just shut off. I looked over at my alarm clock and it was out also. The filter on my fish tank which is in my bedroom shut off completly and the heater light in the fish tank turned off too. Then I had a strange urge to look out my window. And a few seconds later a saw a very bright light, shaped like an circle or oval flew by my window with incredible speed. It was so bright it lit up my entire bedroom and seemed almost as if something as bright as the sun just flew by my window. I made no sound what so ever. My house and my neighbor's house are only about 10 feet apart, and judging by how bright it was and how close it seemed, I'm sure it flew in between my house and my neighbor's house. I never did ask my neighbor if he saw anything, so as far I know, I am the only witness. Once the craft left I was about ready to leap out my window to see if I could see it again. But it happened so quickly I didn't know what to do. Moments later, my alarm clock turned back on but had to be reset. And my radio also turned on again. I beleave it was just a coincidence that I was listening to Sightings on the radio at the time it had happened. I wish to hear your imput and comments concerning this incident. Please e-mail me at: ((deleted))@usa.net Hope to hear form you and thank you for your time.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

We were out back sitting down star gazing,watching planes go by, when there was just a little light left in sky when ((name deleted)) hit me in my arm and asked me,DO YOU SEE THAT! I looked over and saw what I thought was a plane at first but it was a really bright white color and it look like it was landing on the other side off the hill at pearson feild when it shot straight up and left the atmosphere. Then we really started to watch and saw more hovering at a good distance where binoculars could only see a bluish fireball, and they left came back looked like they were just messing around having fun because one of them was heading towards a plain from one side and almost nailed him from looks, don't know how the guy in the plain didn't see that sucker coming.if I remember correctly they were drifting off to the east, couple left the atmosphere and thats all we saw. It was the most intense thing that has happened to me because I have never seen a UFO in person ya know so now that I have seen them I'll make sure to report them!!;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
2 floating white-ish orbs and 1 red spinning cube.;1999-09-02 13:00:00;00:20;2 floating white-ish orbs and 1 red spinning cube. About 12:30-1:30pm I was in my backyard taking pictures of cemtrails when I turned towards a crow that was screaming on top of a tree. And I saw floating towards me was 3 orbs.I was facing S,SW. And I thought they where baloons at first but they were floating E.-against the slight breeze and as I was watching them they formed a triangle.For a few seconds.Then 1 orb left the other 2-it went lower and the others stayed about the same height. I was still watching them through the telephoto lens(70-210mm) as they continued to move East.When I noticed that one was flashing and it looked red.It was paired with the other orb that stayed higher.As it got closer I could see it spinning and it was a cube.It had flat sides that were catching sunlight and making the flashes.And it was spinning on its diagonial-or point. I could`t tell if either orbs were spinning or not.And I kept watching them -the cube&orb seemed to be heading slowly away from me going S. The closer orb kept heading slowly E and it came up again in height but still lower than the other two. And then I hear a prop-plane coming towards me and between me and the objects. The plane was heading Westward and when it got about to the end of my backyard it turned around and seemed to want a closer look at the orbs/objects!!The plane never did come W again. I lost where it went because I was watching the orbs/objects until they faded out of sight- towards the South. I have some 35mm photos and negitives if you want them. I have a scanner but I haven`t learned how to send photos yet. And I wanted to see the photos before I made a report.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Blueberry Size Glowing Orange Object going East, above the Columbia River at 3500-4000 ft. and a speed of approximately 150mph +.;2010-07-04 20:47:00;2-3 mins.;Blueberry Size Glowing Orange Object going East, above the Columbia River at 3500-4000 ft. and a speed of approximately 150mph +. On the night of July 4th, around 20:47 an object came into view as two friends and I saw a glowing orange object cross the sky going above the Columbia River.  It appeared coming in from the South West at a very fast speed, than slowing to 150 mph or about the speed of a small plane.  Its altitude was approximately 3,500-4,000 feet.   The size of the object was approximately the size of a blueberry or the end of your small finger and was glowing orange with a plasma haze around it.   The object was consistent with its trajectory vector and color as it traversed across the sky.  Than it abruptly turned and accelerated in speed, going South East over Portland, OR, at a gradual increase in altitude until it was no longer seen.  The sighting lasted approximately 2-3 minutes.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Glowing fuzzy red ball sighted hovering over east Vancouver.;2011-02-20 19:00:00;10 min;Glowing fuzzy red ball sighted hovering over east Vancouver. I saw the ufo that appeared over Vancouver, WA, Sunday evening, on the 20th of Feb 2011, about 7:00 p.m..   I was in the Fred Meyer  (164th & McGilvery)  parking lot near the south entrance.  The ufo appeared in the sky  directly east of the store.  It appeared as a glowing fuzzy red ball  about the size of a pencil eraser.  I often see planes coming in from  that direction and altitude.   When they are coming straight at you, they  appear to hover just like the ufo did.  I assumed it was a helicopter.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Strange blinking red, blue, and green lights moving in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2011-07-18 22:00:00;5-10 min;Strange blinking red, blue, and green lights moving in the sky. At approximately 10:00 PM on July 18, 2011, my husband was closing the curtains before heading up to bed.  He noticed a multi-color blinking object in the sky to the west of us.   We (myself, my husband, and our son) went out our front door and continued to watch and take pictures/videos of the moving object.   It appeared to be a clear sky and we didn’t notice any stars in the sky.  This object had lights/blinking lights of green, blue, and red.  It appeared to be circular but in some angles of the video looks like a triangular/cone look to one side.   We only saw one object.  It appeared to be at least as high as a plane would be flying. The next morning after still not seeing anything reported on the news or online  I called the local law enforcement agency.  They connected me to a dispatcher and according to the records she saw no other reports of strange lights in the sky that night. I am not sure who else to contact to get answers of what this actually was that we saw.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Slow moving flaming fireball moving east to west SW Washington, 9/28/11 20:50;2011-09-28 20:55:00;2 1/2 to 3 minutes;Slow moving flaming fireball moving east to west SW Washington, 9/28/11 20:50 I was walking my dogs around my urban neighborhood heading due south. A completely clear night.   All the buildings within at least 5 blocks are 2 stories or less.  There were no trees or buildings obstructing my view.  At approximately 10 O‘clock in the sky at a 40 degree angle above me I observed an ember colored object appearing about ½ the size of a full moon which was slowly traveling East to West.  I watched it as it approached towards me and I turned the corner heading due west so I could follow the object.  It kept the same pace as me directly parallel and 12 O’clock above me heading west for about 90 seconds or a little more than ½ the length of the city block as I slowly walked while staring at it.  At that point it changed velocity.  The direction was then WSW and I watched it for another 30 seconds as I continued walking to the end of the block and it got smaller till it disappeared at about 2 O'clock.  It reminded me of a hot ash from a campfire! just fizzling out. The object appeared spherical but with what looked like an orange flame flickering around it.  It looked like it was flying very steady except the “flame” made it appear to jump around a bit, kind of like a small lighter only the light was bright orange/red like a fireplace ember.  There was no discernible noise from the object.  There was sparse local car traffic in the area and I could hear people talking a block away outside the local bar.   There were people coming or going from a yoga studio on the block as I passed by.  There was a large passenger airliner that passed in front of and just under it heading in a SE direction towards the local major airport.  There was a small prop plane passing overhead at 90 degrees but I was not paying much attention to it so I don’t remember its direction.  The entire sighting lasted between 2 and 3 minutes.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

They were bright orange and aligned. He ran into the house to get me. I ran out and saw 2 orange sphere's that were perfectly aligned.  They moved slowly and straight until they vanished. They did get smaller as they moved further away.  As they vanished, I did turn around and notice a plane in the sky. we knew it wasn't anything like that.  My husband thought it might have been a flare., but 2 of them? and both straight and perfect, slowly vanishing?  I thought it looked like a sphere of 3 orange units together.  My husband thought it was a solid unit. Its a mostly clear night.  It happen about 1045pm. no wind. no clouds in the direction it was heading.  And after it all. we notice it was aligned with Orion's Belt.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

approximately 40 + satellite objects but probably twice the size and half again brighter ((Starlink satellites?));2020-10-15 06:21:00;~1 minute;approximately 40 + satellite objects but probably twice the size and half again brighter moving at least 2 1/2 times as fast in pairs with a few single objects.  all moving in a straight line from west to east at about 20 to 30 degrees above the ground level. i could almost say they seemed to be flying in formation all with the same exact trajectory.  the objects appeared across the 2/3 of the night sky.  As a comparison i also saw a typical satellite going a southerly direction and these objects were much brighter and faster. also i saw your typical commercial airplane in the sky and these things weren't even close. I tried to video them with my phone but it wouldn't pick them up.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
