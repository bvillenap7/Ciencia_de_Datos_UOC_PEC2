When i came home i was in a wheel chair and i told the parents i wanted to sit outside as it was a long time since i was able to be in the sun.. Our neighbor was mowing his lawn >> he was a retired officer from the army. I was soaking in the rays when all of a sudden where i was looking over my parents tri level house was a object hovering just on the other side of there house. I looked at it for a second and i was going to screem out loud so that the neighbor would see what i was seeing but the moment i was going to say saomething he stoped his mower and staired at this object. I said do you see what im seeing ? he responded with yes . the object was about 100 feet in length. it was black in color and was silent. I tried to look for features and i saw tubes protrudeing from the side. i could see there was a sort of heat wave around it at least that was what it looked like. i dont remember any lights but it was as clear as a bell i couldnt have been more then a hundred feet from it.. all of a sudden i watched it go toward portland ore. an in a flash it was gone . No trail no nothing. I asked my neighbor can you please come into my parents house and describe what youve seen cause i didnt want them thinking the VA had given me anything for treatment and i was not seeing what ive just seen. Well thats what i saw and i havent told anyone else but close family im 48 years old now and im not in the best of health so i thought if iam to say anything now it should be soon . i hope this helps you . >>> ((name deleted));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
my mom and I  saw a  metallic object fly very quickly in a diagonal line downwards from left to right then a tree blocked our view;2000-08-03 12:25:00;45 seconds;my mom and I  saw a  metallic object fly very quickly in a diagonal line downwards from left to right then a tree blocked our view My mother and I were sitting at a stoplight, and over the treeline (we were right across the street from a park)we saw a small object with a metallic-like shine fly diagonally down from right to left at approx. a 60 degree angle from the ground. It flew quickly, and our view was blocked by one of the evergreens across the street. It looked like it was very far away. It seemed like the sunlight was reflecting off of a sort of rim along the side there was also above it that curved toward the shiny part which made us think that it was 3-d and circular. . .I hope that made sense! We see planes flying to and from the airport all the time, and we discussed that we have never seen one fly that quickly, or at such a strange angle.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
It slowly moved northbound low and slow over rooftops.;2002-08-07 23:20:00;00:25;It slowly moved northbound low and slow over rooftops. It was late at night I was in my backyard about to go to sleep. When I saw a bright light to the east heading northbound. It apeared to be a disk shape illuminated by 5 light on one side. The lights went out for about 5 seconds and then its light came back on and it exelerated like nothing on Earth. It made no sounds and it was a very breif but memorable encounter.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Camas, WA- multiple moving objects observed and filmed 4/19/05 (1:20-4:20a.m.).  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius.  PD));2005-04-19 01:00:00;3.5 hrs. +;Camas, WA- multiple moving objects observed and filmed 4/19/05 (1:20-4:20a.m.). The observers, a young married couple, mid-20's, witnessed a congregation of unknown craft, east of our home. Around 1:20 a.m. my wife noticed a star-like object swaying in the distance, through our bedroom window. It was extremely clear that evening and the moon was very bright (rare for Washington nights this time of year). We both got out of bed to get a closer look, when we noticed 3+ objects, all emitting what looked light red and green light. Not believing what we were seeing, several other craft came into view to the north of us. We witnessed strange and rapid movements, and light emissions. After 10 minutes, I grabbed our video camera and started filming. We switched off, capturing 20-30 minutes of footage. We filmed interaction between the craft and obscure individual movement of 2-3 of them. Viewing the objects through the video lens allowed us to see much greater detail and some great close-ups were captured.  One object was mainly filmed as it was the brightest and most prominent. My wife believes she saw this same bright object the following night.  However as she turned on the video camera and started to focus on it, the video camera shut off.  She tried a second time, and the video camera shut off again.  The bright object was in a different position in the sky, and this was an earlier time of night through a different window in the house.  This is the 3rd night since our first sighting, and the sky is cloudy so we cannot see anything. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at the star, Sirius, or perhaps some other twinkling star or celestial body.  We spoke with the witness, and he sounded quite sincere, but he witnessed the same object several days later.  He stated that he recently moved to Washington from Los Angeles, where the residents rarely see the night sky clearly.  PD));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

I looked up as an airliner was going over the usual landing path in our area went overhead.   Next to the airliner I saw an object. It was oval & dark, maybe dark due to the time of night.  I watched the airliner pass it.  Then I focused on the object. It was rocking back and forth, left to right.   I called to my daughter who was just inside the door. She came out and saw it too.  We watched it as it traveled towards the west, still rocking from side to side.   It went into a thin hazy cloud and my daughter said maybe it's a weather balloon. It was traveling slowly and I asked my daughter, why would a weather balloon be rocking from side to side?, then it came out from the thin hazy cloud, went a little bit further (I also need to mention that the whole time it was traveling slowly) then all of a sudden it made a sharp left turn into denser clouds and then it was gone.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Saucer like object with clear red & blue lights;2006-07-21 01:20:00;nearly an hour;Saucer like object with clear red & blue lights At around 1:20 a.m. we went out back of my house, which is facing dirrectly West.  We see a light in the distance but I quickly shrugged it off as an airplane because of the red and blue flashing lights.  We BS'd outside for a few more minutes before we realized that the object hadn't moved in the sky (or atleast not enough to be a plane).  We got our camera with a high powered lense, and were able to get a better view.  The object was undoubtably saucer shaped, with a red light that was traveling around the object, and a blue light that appeared to be stationary at top.  The red light was very prodominant every time it circled around the object.  The longer we watched the object, we realized it was starting to move West.  It moved West, a really really long ways for almost 45 minutes, to the point that it was getting a bit more difficult to see, but the strange thing is the red light was still very prominant.  You could tell it was a red light (looking like blinking now) but it was thousands of miles away at this point.  The object then changed course and started heading north.  It was obviously too far away to really see it moving from looking at it.  But we used landmarks (trees, other objects) to be able to tell when the object was staying still, or moving in a particular direction. I know of no aircraft that is known to the public that can produce the results that we saw tonight.  Hopefully someone else saw it !!!!  I believe the object was someone over our coast range when we first spoted it.  Then again I am not expert on telling how far away objects in the sky are.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

2 disc objects with circular haze around them, red, blue and white lights on them. 2ft diameter, hovering 50ft off ground.;2012-03-14 23:30:00;15-20mins;2 disc objects with circular haze around them, red, blue and white lights on them. 2ft diameter, hovering 50 ft off ground. I went out my front door at about 11:30pm to let my dog out. I was looking around while waiting for him to come in when I noticed an object hovering about 20ft above my cherry tree in my front yard. The tree is about 40ft from my house. I then noticed another object of same size and characteristics hovering over the house across from mine- about 80ft away. The first one flew over to the second one and I stood and observed the second one move quickly in four lateral directions randomly over my neighbor's house while the first slowly hovered around the second, no more that a couple feet away. The objects were small and appeared to be about 2ft in diameter, with a translucent haze around them and red, blue, and white lights on and inside them. They then moved on the the next house together, doing the same thing. I then went in the house to grab my camera and get my husband. He came with me outside and I noticed the objects above a house further (300-400ft) down! the street. I went to follow them with my camera but as soon as I got closer and tried to take a picture they seemed to react and moved quickly down the street out of sight.

There was no sound that accompanied the UFO. I shot several videos, best footage captured being just over four minutes long.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
