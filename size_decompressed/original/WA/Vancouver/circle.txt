I think I witnessed the same sighting as reported on this website by someone else.  I will never forget what happened, but as I was the only witness in my vehicle, I tried to dismiss it, but I can't, I marked down the date and time, so that if anything ever came out in the future, I would know I wasn't nuts. After watching a UFO show on TV, I decided it was time to do research and see if anyone else reported what I had seen. I know what time it was because I looked at my watch, so I would always know what time it happened. I had 3 sightings or encounters in that month, and nothing ever again. This was the first. I was driving  SE on highway 270 between the former Morse RD and 670 exits, on my way home from my mother's house, there were several other cars out at the time, as I was driving, something caught my eye up to my right at about 1 o clock.  It was a round cluster of lights, red blue green and white, from what  could see, I couldn't make out an object clearly just a cluster of lights in a circular pattern, what caught my eye was the movement pattern.  It was hovering in a spot and it would dart to one driection then another, like center, then  down right, then down left then back up to the hover point.  I have never seen any man made machine capable of such quick and precisely executed movements.  It looked like a pinball, being shot back and forth, though it hoved a bit at each ending point. I pulled over immediately to make sure I was seeing what i thought.  I sat there in awe, watching it dart back and forth so fast and in a way that defied normal flight, no helicopter etc could have moved that way, and it covered large distances in a so called flash. I looked at my watch to verify the time. I was terrified.  i saw 2 other vehicles pull over during that time, i assume they had seen what i saw, but i was scared so i pulled back on the freeway and drove on home.  I finally got the nerve to look online and see if anyone else saw this. A the next night , i was spending the night at my mothers in this same area, when something equally odd happened. I was in my little sisters room and we couldn't sleep, so we were talking.  suddenly the room started to shake as if vibrated by some huge motor and the room started to glow red-orange, brighter and brighter, like the light was coming through the window.  We heard a loud whirring metallic sound, like screeching metal that sounded like it had a pattern, almost like music. we were terriified, and it lasted for several minutes, the light kept changing, like it was in a search pattern, but the noise level remianed the same. my sister and i sat staring at one another, afraid to say anything, finally when the light went down a little i jumped up and looked out the window, i had to know what it was, i knew if i didn't look, someone could try to discount me. But after what i saw the night before, i had to know.  The glow was coming form directly over our house and also from the woods behind it, there was more than one source, i think the metallic music must have come from the one overhead, explaining why the volume never changed, but the light did. I am convined it wasn't a police helicopter or anytthing, i have seen them before. I have never seen one with orange light.  I never saw any craft of any sort, just the glow from above and the woods, obviously i couldn't see what was over the roof, i thought about popping the screen and sticking my head out her window but I was too scared.  It wasn't anyhting like the night before's sighting.  But my mom lives in the same area where i had seen the lights the night before.  i honestly believe the glow the following night came from government craft, possibly tracking or searching for the object from the night before in the woods behind her house. Strange radio frequency's can be picked up sometimes late at night out there, that have the same sound as i had heard that night, though never on the same channel twice in a row. And no it isn't static.  My sis and i heard somehting one night that sounded like German and spanish mixed together, being spoken too rapidly for anyone to understand, no music. I really don't know what else to say. I have no pics or anything, don't even know if this is usefull. I don't live there anymore, nor have i ever related this story before, but it feels good to get it out of my system. My sister saw and heard the same thing I did. I have never seen or heard anyhting else. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Same size orange glow was dropped? and left trail when falling then vanished. We saw no green/red/white marker lights and heard no sound.  We watched until it was too far away to see.  No pictures or video, Sorry. There is not much to add to our breif description.  There were trees in the way for part of the time so we lost sight for a few minutes.  The orange ball that dropped was the same size when it left the other ball but then looked sort of tear shaped as it dropped and left a trail of orange looking like hanging by a string for just a second or two.  I saw the object coming from the north and by the time the others saw it we were looking at it going south.  There were no marker lights of any kind from our view point.  We live near PDX flight path and the Evergreen Airport in Vanc. WA.  The object was too high to be landing at Evergreen and heading in the wrong direction to be going to PDX.  We just thought someone else may have seen the object also or that you folks know what it might be??  No drugs or alcohol involved!!;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

siting over vancouver, Wa.;2000-07-15 07:00:00;5 minutes;siting over vancouver, Wa. I woke up early on saturday to get a early start. Made my coffee and went out on my porch to drink coffee and smoke a morning cigarette. From my apartment I have a good open view. As I did a pan view I saw a dark grey object just to the right but a good distance in back of the closest tree. When I first saw it, I thought what the hell is that. I sat there and stared at the object seeing if it was moving. It might have been slightly but maybe not at all. I thought maybe I should grab my camera, But like a fool I figured maybe it is just a balloon from a carlot or something like that. So after 4 minutes I turned away and started pacing around (bad habit of mine)and looked again and it was gone!!!!;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Round shape flying across evening sky for about four minutes.   ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS overflight.  PD));2009-07-18 22:50:00;4 minutes;Round shape flying across evening sky for about four minutes. The shape of what was seen was round.  It appeared white to one of us, but the other thought it was orange, possibly from the sun reflection.  It was quite a bit above a jet plane that we watched come from the south and crossed above the plane’s path.  The plane was at about 25,000 feet that was flying in a northwest direction. The UFO was at about 50,000 feet and moved without any sign of white streaks from the engines.  The skies were clear and cloudless.  The jet plane left a white trail, and we watched this plane for two to three minutes.  Another plane was traveling perpendicular to the first plane, and also left a white trail. The time was approximately 19:50, when we watched an UFO coming from the north and moved southeast for about 45 seconds and then turned south for about minute.  It seemed to pause for about 20 to 30 seconds in one spot, and then it headed east for approximately one minute.  The UFO seemed to pause again and then continued east until we couldn’t see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS overflight.

Green/blue circle seen in Vancouver, Washington;2013-05-31 22:15:00;5 minutes;Green/blue circle seen in Vancouver, Washington At approximately 10:15 pm I noticed a ball of light in the sky northwest of where I was sitting on my patio near the corner of NE 136th and McGillivray.  The color of the light was green with a hint of blue.  The light was moving east and I could just glimpse it behind a group of trees.  Then the light reversed direction.  As I watched, the moved around in an irregular way, east to west and back again. I went back into my apartment and asked my husband to come outside and look. It took him only a few seconds to come outside but by then the light was gone.  We stood outside for about 30 seconds before he went back inside.  I came outside again about 1 minute later and the light was back. I called my husband out again and this time he also saw the light. We watched it move now not only east to west, west to east, but also north and south. As I watched I saw a man in a car parked across the street. He got out of his car and stood in the park and was filming it. I did not include this man in the data I provided as I did not speak to him.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Unknown object displaying unusual flight characteristics.;2014-07-04 23:35:00;2 minutes;Unknown object displaying unusual flight characteristics. At approximately 23:35 PST, I observed a small object at a relatively long distance, estimated at 3-5 miles, over the eastern section of Portland, OR.   This area is roughly due east of the major airport in the area. The object accelerated at an unusual rate and performed maneuvers inconsistent with any aircraft design I am aware of.  At times, it hovered in place, then proceeded to accelerate at a high rate in an east to west direction, then doing the same in reverse.  In addition, it also appeared to descend rapidly, then ascend again over the treeline into view in the same location. There was no change in the lighting that you would expect with a turning aircraft, as the object appeared to maintain the same aspect at all times.  At approximately 23:37 PST, it sank below the treeline and left my field of view.  Unknown if this was due to a descent in altitude or acceleration away from my position, as both would produce a similar effect.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

No sound from object and without slowing down made a sharp 90 degree turn south.;2017-12-13 21:00:00;13 seconds;No sound from object and without slowing down made a sharp 90 degree turn south. December 13, 2017.  At About 9:00 PM Pacific Time December 13, 2017 in Vancouver, Washington, I saw what I strongly believe to be a UFO.  I was outside to watch the meteor show when I saw an object moving from West to East.  I was looking north.  If you were to hold up a ruler at arm’s length it travel about 18 inches.  Without slowing down it then made a very sharp turn south maybe a 90 degree turn and if holding a ruler at arm’s length I could see it travel about 4.5 feet. If you held up a dime at arm’s length that would be about the size of the object, maybe slightly larger.  It appeared to be round but not sure if it were a true round object as I was watching this at about a 70 degree angle from the ground which would give it a slight appearance of being oval.  But I would say it was round. They were few clouds out that night and there were no clouds interfering with my view of the object. The best way I could describe the object is as follows.  Picture a perfectly round fried egg and hold it up at a 70 degree angle.  That round egg now looks slightly oval which is how I saw it.  The background that the object was seen against was night time black. The whole object was not bright but very faint as if there were clouds beneath it, but there were no clouds beneath it as the stars in the same area were brite.  The entire yoke part of the egg would look an orange/red color, but more orange than red and faint.  The entire white of the egg look like a translucent aura with the same color as the yoke but much more faint as it did appear to be translucent.  I could not see any dome or any other geometric shapes.  So there were no distinct individual lights just this faint glow. It travel in a perfect straight line going from west to east, and when it made that sharp turn to the south.  It also traveled in a straight line.  It did not move up or down, no other objects were seen with it.  There were no flashing lights and no other color then the color describe above. It made no noise of any kind.  Aircraft from nearby PDX could clearly be heard but no sound came from the object.  There were no other aircraft at that time that may have covered up any sound coming from the object I was observing. It was traveling at a speed I would say somewhat faster than aircraft landing or taking off from PDX.  If it was a UFO I would say that the speed it was traveling at was a good cruising speed for a UFO. Also when it turned south it would have been heading toward PDX or near PDX.  This object maintain the same altitude the whole time I observed it and it was not in any typical landing pattern for PDX. There were no trails of smoke or haze it maintain the shape of the egg and everything I observed about the object stayed within those perimeters. It was not somebody on the ground with some kind of light shining up into the sky.  There was no beam of light going up into the sky plus anyone on the ground would not have been able to shine a light for the distance that I saw this object travel.  A light coming from the ground would have been interrupted by houses and trees.  It also was not a weather balloon. There are four very distinct attributes about the object I observed.  1) Appearance was larger than any aircraft I have seen flying overhead.  2) It made no sound.  3) The aura that completely went around the object. 4) It made a very sharp turn.  All other aircraft I have seen have to make a curved turn, this was a sharp turn like the corner of a square. I will be 71 years old in February 2018 and in my life time I have never seen anything like what I saw, or anything closely resembling what I saw. Since this was in such close proximity to the PDX airport this object must have appeared on their radar.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Saw 'white orb swarm' of 10-20 during the day, near Columbia River in Vancouver,  WA on 4/30/20.;2020-04-30 17:00:00;5 minutes;Saw 'white orb swarm' of 10-20 during the day, near Columbia River in Vancouver,  WA on 4/30/20. Was walking along Columbia River Drive, along the Columbia River, in Vancouver,  WA. (Portland, OR is across the river)  Headed east, around 5:30pm today on 4/30/20. Noticed 4 hawks circling, also many planes from nearby PDX.  While looking at the hawks, I noticed 10-20 white, golf-ball like orbs zooming around each other in a swarm.  They looked small, but were about plane elevation, so they must be much bigger in actuality.  It was a mostly clear day, with only a few clouds. I asked my daughter to confirm what I saw, & she saw them as well.  It really freaked her out.  I tried to video, but they were too small to pick up on her phone. They were white, but very bright, possibly metallic. They did seem to shift from white to metallic. Like they were half & half? After a few minutes of watching, they all vanished a few at a time, or became invisible, until they were all gone. It lasted about 5 minutes all together. They seemed much too agile to be drones. Watched the skies for a long time afterwards, but they didn't reappear. I have seen what looks very similar captured on video after looking into this, but no definitive identification for them that I'm aware of.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Lights over Vancouver  ((Starlnk satellites??));2021-05-16 11:00:00;5-7 mins;Lights over Vancouver On May 16th I took my dog outside for bathroom at about 11:00pm. As soon as we got outside I looked up and saw a long line of bright white lights crossing the sky. The line of lights went as far north as I could see, (about half the night sky before the horizon was blocked by an apartment building) and as they moved over head they would just disappear one at a time in the same exact spot. The lights were moving relatively slow and were in a perfectly straight uniformed line, all the same distance from one another. I tried to film it with my IPhone 8, but nothing showed up so I ran inside, told my girlfriend to come out and grabbed her iPhone 11. I went back outside and tried to film with her phone, but it still didn’t show up so  I went back inside and Convinced my girlfriend to come out and she also saw the line of lights. About 10 or 15 seconds after she came out another much much larger bright light appeared and started to move across the sky at the same ! slow speed in a different direction. After about a minute and a half from when she came out the seemingly endless line of lights came to an end as we saw the last one pass over head and disappear. At that point my girlfriend went inside, but I stayed and watched the larger bright light until it went out of view over the horizon. It was literally just that, a large bright circular  light, nothing was blinking or had any color at all, and I didn’t even think to film it because I had already given up on filming before it appeared. In total I watched the lights for about 5 to 7 minutes and they were already in full swing when I first saw them. Also while I was filming the first time I watched a small farm plane fly right by the line of lights. I guarantee he got a great view of them, he may have even  been able to see where they were originating from idk. Here’s the thing Where I live is a very densely populated area near an airport so I’m amazed I couldn’t find a report from w! here I live that nigh (which is why I’m reporting this) so if ! anyone g ot a different  view please report, especially if anyone got it on film, that would be so cool!;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
