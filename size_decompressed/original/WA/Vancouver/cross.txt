Yellow, rotating, cross-like object in midnight sky.;2018-07-23 00:15:00;~20 minutes;Yellow, rotating, cross-like object in midnight sky. There was complete darkness outside as it was past midnight, and there was one object that seemed to be almost a yellow tinged color with a cross like shape.  Almost seemed to have beams out the sides and top and bottom.  It did seem to be rotating around horizontally, but in a stationary position in the sky.  When rotating, the object got brighter and the shape morphed a little more rounded.   It definitely was not an aircraft, as I have flown and studied them.  It was stationary in the sky with no altitude change during the duration I was watching.  It was too low to be a star/satellite.   There were aircraft flying during this 20 minute duration that exhibited no similarities to this object as they moved across the sky in a different color and flashing alternating lights.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
