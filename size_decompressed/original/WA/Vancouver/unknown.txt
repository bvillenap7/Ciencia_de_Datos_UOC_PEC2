Sighting near Vancouver, Washington/Portland Oregon in August of 1999;1999-08-15 18:50:00;10 min;Sighting near Vancouver, Washington/Portland Oregon in August of 1999 We were driving across the I-5 bridge from Vancouver, WA to Portland, OR when I noticed an object in the sky that didn't move at all. The sun was coming down and it didn't appear to have any lights on but was reflecting sunlight.   It was completely still in the sky. I showed my husband, who was also very confused by the object.  It was like nothing we've ever seen before.   I watched the object for several minutes before I saw it move very abruptly and FAST across the sky.  I located the object again and then saw a military plane come up and investigate the object and then the object disappeared very quickly.  This was very close to Pearson Airfield.  The object was very high in the sky so it's very hard to approximate the size. Years later we were watching a show about UFO's and saw a video of a UFO in Gulf Breeze, Florida that looked exactly like the object we saw.  Here is a picture I found online.  http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:ixgAW76BvG6KrM:http://www.paradigmresearchgroup.org/graphics/Video%2520Archive/Sighting_Gulf_Breeze-1995.jpg ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Fast flying lighted object from North to South, lights dimmed, then went out and object was then not perceivable.;1999-12-26 18:12:00;10 - 15 seconds;Fast flying lighted object from North to South, lights dimmed, then went out and object was then not perceivable. I went out of the front door of my house facing east.  I had just looked at the clock and it was between 18:10 and 18:13 in the evening.  It was dark and the sky was clear.  A lighted objected caught my eye.  It appeared to be low in the sky, traveling at a high rate of speed from north to south.  The light appeared to be incandescent (white/yellow). What caught my attention was that there was no red/green lights or a flashing on/off light that is common to airplanes.  In the short time that I saw the object, it appeared to have two compartments (all that I could perceive).  The lights in the rear compartment seemed to dim until they went out. After that the front compartment lights went out as if they were switched off.  When the lights were out, I couldn't see the object anymore. My estimated time of viewing was about 10 seconds.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
1 Min- High Pitch Noise;2000-03-17 03:15:00;1 min;1 Min- High Pitch Noise I just want to know if anyone else in this general area heard anything. Or saw/experienced anything like this.  This has happend before many times. (Different situations). A strange high pitch noise came from our computer room. Computer was on but I was not in the room. I often stay up late on my computer and have never heard this from that room before! Within seconds after it started and then a loud low flying fast (aircraft) went over.  But the strange thing is, the  high pitch noise shut off one minute later.  Like a switch.  I was not tired before this but suddenly afterword overwhelmed with exhaustion to where I could hardly write this down on paper. I often stay up alot later then this! But the (airplane) engine or humming sound one makes never ceased completly! I can still hear it an hour later, its not as loud but its still out there!;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Large, Flame like object  at daybreak in Columbia River Gorge  ((NUFORC Note:  It looks like a distant contrail to us.  PD));2004-10-03 07:25:00;15 Minutes;Large, Flame like object  at daybreak in Columbia River Gorge The bright object first caught my eye while driving on State Route 14 going east from Vancouver to Washougal, WA to walk my dog on a dike paralleling the Columbia River. It remained in the horizon about thirty degrees above [see attached photo] due north/west of Mt. Hood. It was a beautiful morning and the sun was just coming up. As I began walking my dog going east, I watched it coming towards me or so I thought because it was becoming brighter. I got concerned and called my husband on my cell phone. It then began retreating, and so I pulled out my tiny Nikon Coolpix 3700 camera and zoomed all the way to capture it before it got too far away. I would say it was in view for ten minutes while driving and five minutes while walking before it retreated slowly behind the hills in the Columbia Gorge. I didn't think much of it until I saw the EXACT same object on the news this morning [Fort Wayne] video taped by another observer. It was not a meteror--it moved too slowly and stayed in the same general location of the sky. As you can see in the photo it was quite large and very bright. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object is a contrail behind a distant high-altitude jet in the extreme distance..  PD));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
We all saw 6 different crafts with lights.  All were moving extremely slow.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling stars???  PD));2007-01-14 23:00:00;2 hours;We all saw 6 different crafts with lights.  All were moving extremely slow.  1 craft was lower than the others and the lights were brighter.  This craft had very bright lights that were blue, white and red.  The other craft's lights were not as bright and only red and white.  All were spaced great distances apart in the sky, but all moving slowly.  We observed several planes fly by the crafts over 2 hours, but got too cold so we went inside.  We called different people we knew and told them to go outside and look.  They all saw the crafts too.  I tried to report it to the news paper, but the guy didn't seem interested.  They are still out there now if you want to look. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling stars???

UFOs seen converging with fighter jets just after takeoff.;2007-08-11 10:00:00;1:00;UFOs seen converging with fighter jets just after takeoff. I turned my camera on at the sound of fighter jets taking off out of a nearby International airport. What I captured initially were just routine fighter jets, when I played back the video, I saw a white light in the upper right corner of the frame. As I played the video from the beginning frame by frame, I noticed a single dot entering the frame converging with the second jet. In the next frame it appeared to go through the fighter jet forming black dots in the next frame above and below the jet, in the next frame three black dots appear  perfectly triangulating in close proximity around the jet. In the next frame they seem to have scattered. In the next few frames a light appears in the upper right corner of the frame, camera then goes out of view of object, camera steadies and in the next few frames a white light is seen again in the upper right corner descending rapidly, it goes out of focus for some frames until it is seen again, as a black dot converging with the fourth fighter jet. Then as soon as it converges in the next few frames is seen rapidly fleeing away at an ascending angle, the final image capture shows black dot above a previously unseen unknown object. With my limited access to better technology to further view these images, this is what I have seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to view the video.  PD));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
3 objects not moving, and then all of a sudden 2 slowly moved, and then the 3rd took off till it disappeared, and the 2 other took off.;2008-06-20 10:26:00;1 minute;3 objects not moving, and then all of a sudden 2 slowly moved, and then the 3rd took off till it disappeared, and the 2 other took off. I was out taking care of my plants, and heard a strange noise.  Thinking it was a jet taking off or landing at PDX, I started looking for an aircraft.  I saw a couple of jet smoke, but no jet.  Then as I looked straight up in the sky, I saw 3 silver spots, just sitting above the city, it was quite high.  Then two started moving slowly and the third one was behind the two, just suddenly took off very fast, and disappeared, then the other two took off as well and as fast, till all 3 were gone.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Orange ball ufo muti witness 4th july vancouver WA;2011-07-04 20:00:00;3 mins;Orange ball ufo muti witness 4th july vancouver WA I was watching 4th of july fireworks with my family.  I noticed what i thought to be a plane  wich is normal because we live next to PDX and know all the planes in are air space and there light configs. but this was just a orange ball of light not flickering or any thing.  It was very bright.  I kept watching it as it flew from north to south.  It was to the east of me, and I was in east vancover at about 112th AVE 39thST.   I kept waiting for it to look familair to me but it stayed just the not perfectly round orange ball.  I kinda got the feeling like it might be pretty big and far away.   was no sound.  It was so bizzar looking that all 5 of us stoped watching the fireworks for 20 mins while we all tryed to make sence of what we seen.   The event lasted about 2 to 3 mins for the ground it covered it had to be moving pretty good. Ive seen people launch flares on the 4th before and this was not that.   It started on the northern horizen toward battle ground WA, and was heading toward east portland OR,  It got to about fisherslanding and turned off like faded out completely then flashed back on and faded backout, and then we seen nothing else.   I noticed the thing was not flickering like fire or a flame or a flare, but was very intence and solid no flicker till it plused on and off.  The people with me where my mom dad girlfriend brother and my cousin.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
7 flashing moving objects that drop off an object;2011-10-24 01:00:00;30 minutes;7 flashing moving objects that drop off an object I was taking the trash out when I had this gut feeling to look up, so I did. I saw what I figured was a plane because the red flashing lights and it was flying straight. I watched it for about 30 seconds and it stopped moving. The lights were still flashing, now from red, blue, green to yellowish. More morphing into each other than flashing. Then it started to move around and hover. I looked down to focus my eyes, notice the pattern the street lights were in, looked back up and saw the same pattern (5 stars). So I looked above that and saw a pentagon of which all had moved or I saw lights. Shape from where I was at if you lift your hands straight up and out, and have a two inch space between index and both thumbs, that’s roughly the size of the pentagon. I went back to the first one and it was slightly moving and lights still, fairly, going. I then focused and physically saw my vision make a tunnel to the “UFO” and I then immediately saw 1-3 shooting star looking lights fly between the two sets of  stars.  (My mind is kind of fuzzy, it was either one with 3 points that connected, or 3 different ones that mesh together) I, then again, look back at the first craft I saw and watched for another minute and then it had dropped something.  A very small, smaller than the stars around, object/s lofted off the craft.  I keep watching for awhile, they do nothing but slightly move and just hover.  I look back towards the first one and made a connection in my head that I had seen a UFO and then I saw another craft take off as if it’s a shooting star.  Then I start to go back inside, decide to take another look, walk back and look between the trees (where my first sighting was at a different location) and see another one flying.  Then it stops! directly in the center of the surrounding trees, hovers, lights are going, and it just stayed there.  Then it took my breath away, and I went back inside.  (My other report of the same craft different night is posted as 9/5/11)  Both times of which i could not record :(;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Very strange sound heard sounded as if it had a melody.;2014-04-28 22:00:00;20 minutes;Very strange sound heard sounded as if it had a melody. I was getting ready for bed at approximately 10:00 pm, when I started hearing a very odd sound coming from the sky.  It was definitely not any plane or helicopter I've ever heard it sounded like a plane descending kind of humming whistle but it was constant and almost sounded as if it had a melody to it.  Doing what any one would do if they heard something strange like that I walked outside to investigate I couldn't see anything but I could still hear the sound it sounded as if it was coming from everywhere at once.   I tried recording the sound but when I played it back you couldn't hear the sound (the recording device has bad audio).   Around ten minutes after trying to record it with no luck I went inside to get online and see if anyone else had heard the sound and my internet froze just completely stopped working. It wouldn't come back on until the next day I usually don't have internet problems so that happening is very uncommon.  At around 10:25-10:30 pm, I heard at least 4 helicopters flying over the area they hovered over the area for at least 15 minutes before dispatching.  I walked into my living room and  asked my sister if she had heard the sound she told me she muted the TV because she thought she heard a really weird melody coming from outside but didn't think much of it... she is not as in to the  UFO scene as I am. Although I didn't see anything that would say UFO, I definitely heard something very strange and simultaneously lost connection to the internet which is in my mind definitely proof of something.   I've had a couple experiences with UFO's in my life, but none as strange as this this sound was not from any mainstream aircraft.  It could of been a HAARP test but I don't know I am mainly posting this to see if anyone else has heard something similar.

Red and green lights flashing, while hovering and moving, then stopping.;2015-07-04 22:00:00;30 minutes;Red and green lights flashing, while hovering and moving, then stopping. We were watching fireworks and I noticed high in the sky bright green lights flashing in a row then bright red lights flashing in a row.  The craft was just hovering for quite some time, then it moved and then just stopped and hovered again.  We seen a plane and a helicopter flying in a different direction which we were able to clearly make out, but we could not make out the shape of the craft because of the lights.  It hovered and moved a couple of times and it looked strange the way it could just stop and make no movement instantly.  After a while it just seemed to drop then take off.  No sound was heard from the craft.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Odd blinking high in western sky over what would be towards the oregon coast from Portland;2017-09-11 21:19:00;ongoing;Odd blinking high in western sky over what would be towards the oregon coast from Portland I was in my backyard getting my dogs in and looked up to the west and noticed a steady blinking red and white very high in the sky, I just kept watching it.  Then I noticed more than one helicopter fly past me heading in that direction.  Whatever it is, it's blinking, which caught my eye, looks like it has a tail of some sort.  Totally weird.   I thought it may be the ISS but that's over Great Britain right now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Bright blue and solid light traveling NNE over Vancouver, WA (98661) neighborhood with almost inaudible sound and no apparent shape.;2019-10-27 20:30:00;60-90 seconds;Bright blue and solid light traveling NNE over Vancouver, WA (98661) neighborhood with almost inaudible sound and no apparent shape. At approximately 2030 at the cross streets of Watson and 28th within the Fourth Plain Village neighborhood in the city of Vancouver, WA, my mother, daughter and I observed a solid blue light traveling NNE.  At first, as it was off in the distance about ½ Mile away and with very good visibility on a very clear evening, I thought it was moving due east until I noticed it getting larger. It was a larger light compared to common drone lighting but was only blue and bright until it got closer when it became a slightly whiter version of the same blue color.  It was low, at what I guessed would be about 300 feet but made no sound except a very low hissing noise. We observed it go right overhead about 200 feet east of our position of observation in my mother's driveway. The total time of observation was approximately 60-90 seconds.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
