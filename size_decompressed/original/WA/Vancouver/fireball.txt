A 5 second slow 60 degree arc of light slower & brighter greenish glow toward end of arc traveling east to west.;1998-09-23 21:10:00;5 seconds;A 5 second slow 60 degree arc of light slower & brighter greenish glow toward end of arc traveling east to west. My wife and I were sitting in our hot tub Wednesday evening as we often do.  We have spent many hours out there in the evenings observing the high altitude jets on their way to Seattle and counting satellites as they orbit and the occasional metorite.  I mention this only to indicate that we are very familar with the normal nighttime sky activity. At approximately 9:10PM, I interrupted our conversation, pointed at the sky and said WHOA!.....WHOA!......WHOA!......WHOA! as I tracked the light across the sky.  It is my exclamations that now help me estimate the time duration of the event.  In this time it traveled from the east to the west in about a 60 degree arc until it passed behind a tree.  I also estimate the angle from the horizon was about 60 degrees to the south of our location in Cascade Park, Vancouver, WA. Some things I noticed most unusual:  The speed slowed and became brighter toward the end of my vision, glowing a bright greenish blue.  The size of the fireball seemed larger at the end, about the size of  a baseball in the air at 30 feet.  Also, even from the beginning of the arc the speed of this object was much slower than and metorite I have ever  observed and we did enjoy the recent summer meteor showers.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

At 6:40 p.m. on10/26/98 I saw a big white and yellow ball of light flashing across the sky from south to north.  It took about eight to ten seconds to cross the sky.  I was at the barn working on my truck.  It is a clear night , no clouds, rain or fog, stars and planes going by.  Then I saw it go by, it went across the sky and over the trees.  I thought it was going to hit but I didn't hear a crash.  I thought I saw something earlier about 6:15 or so but I thought nothing of it.  I went up to the house and called 911.  1 hour later they called me back and I called you [Peter Davenport].;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Taking an evening walk facing west and saw a very bright, large orange fireball go overhead toward the west and then vanish.  What was ;2001-01-19 19:00:00;minute;Taking an evening walk facing west and saw a very bright, large orange fireball go overhead toward the west and then vanish.  What was interesting is the next day I flew to Maui for vacation.  When reading the Maui Sunday newspaper I came across  a small article about   a large orange fireball in the night sky moving east to west on Saturday night (Jan. 20th). The zetatalk website (which, regardless of who is supposed to be giving out the information) is a very thorough, and food for thought site to study. According to them the orange fireballs are part of the precursors to the approach of the so called l2th planet.  Apparently this l2th planet, or giant comet, or ball of redemption, or whatever one wishes to call it, can be viewed now by telescope in the night sky.  What are your views on this? ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC does record fireballs in its database, but we are not aware of a 12th planet.  As far as we know, there are only nine planets in the solar system.

i saw a very large slow moving golden fireball that split into several parts;2002-11-28 06:15:00;1 minute;((NUFORC Note:  Reported to be re-entering space debris.  We are grateful to all of those who submitted reports.  PD)) i saw a very large slow moving golden fireball that split into several parts while sitting at the computer a light caught my eye and although it has always been airplanes or some celestial body that was obscured by a branch i still tend to look in case it may be something interesting. upon closer observation i realized that it was a very large slow movin golden streak that was leaving a tail that was at least as long as two fingers width at arms length. i watched for a few seconds and then ran outside to get a better view. by the time i was outside it seemed to have mirved or split into three definite heads. it was in the northern sky and was travelling from west to east passing behind some large trees nearby. if i were to estimate a point of landing i would have to guess somewhere on the east side of the cascades. it was also moving very slowly especially for something so large. it may well have been orbital detritus dropping into the atmosphere. although i am no expert in any sciences i do know the difference between an airplane, a sattelite or a metorite. this was none of those threee things.

Huge fireball.  ((NUFORC Note:  Meteors are not visible for 10 minutes' duration.  PD));2010-07-28 22:00:00;10 min.;huge fireball My Boyfriend and I were sitting on our front porch and we saw a bright orange glow coming toward us at a very fast speed,  It began to get brighter so we went out into the street to observe it, then it looked like it was splitting in two but it was a piece of something falling from the fireball looking object,   It kept moving at a fast speed south of us towards the Portland International airport in which we live only 5 min. from the I-5 bridge that crosses into Oregon.   At first we thought it could have been a firecracker but it was too big and made no sound and kept moving accross the sky for a long period of time until we couldnt see it through the trees.   We tried calling our local news station to report it but no luck and we tried to call the airport but could not find a reporting number so I thought I would report it on you'r site in hopes to learn more about what we saw tonight.   My thought is that it was a metoer or something from space, so I plan on calling OMSI tomorrow to report as well and to find out what we saw..

2 fireballs hovering and possibly landing.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  We cannot reach the source of the report.  PD));2010-08-24 23:15:00;5 mins;2 fireballs hovering and possibly landing. Saw a fireball moving toward me along a path close to the PDX flight path.  The fire was trailing behind so it was obviously moving.  It the stopped, hovered in place (visible with no obstructions of any sort) for about 2-3 minutes while we observed it.   At this time, other witnesses pointed out a second orange light which appeared to be much higher up and much further away.  The nearby, hovering fire, then moved away from us and made a left turn I could then observe it traveling straight downward (observed through a tree) until it disappeared near the ground.   The farther light became dimmer, flickered, then disappeared (may have moved behind a different tree causing us to lose sight of it). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.

Red Fireball like objects hovering over a field in Vancouver, WA;2011-09-30 23:00:00;About 5 Mins long;Red Fireball like objects hovering over a field in Vancouver, WA My sister, Cousin, and I were Driving down Fourth Plain on our way home from getting taco bell, and we were stopped at a light when I looked up and saw 3 things in the sky.  At first I thought that they were just stars, but then I noticed that they were to close to be stars, so I thought they were planes, but after looking at them for a few seconds I noticed that they were not moving.   That’s when my cousin told me that they were UFO’s and its not the first time that she has seen them.  It is her second time.  They were in a perfect line.  They were red and like a fireball.   As we started to drive away we noticed that one shut up into the sky, then 2nd  seconds later the second one took off and then 2 seconds later the 3rd.   It was a very outrageous experience.  I never in my life thought I would ever see a UFO. It was a great thing to see.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

I was driving with my two friends from taco bell on fourth plain blvd. when my friend said what are those i looked up and seen 3 red glowing balls in a triangler form.  This was my second time seeing these. I seen the same type of UFO last year above ym house in July of 2010 around the same time too!  I was looking back which was hard because I was trying to drive and seen 1 by 1 within seconds dissapearing into the sky.  These could not be a plane or anything they were soundless and hovered. the 3 objects could not be connected.  Me and my friends became very frightened because it was so unreal like nothing we have ever seen before.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
2 then 1 fireball that changed from white to yellow, orange, red, & blue moving over battle ground to washougal and on to Mt.

My 2 daughters tried to get me to come look at what they described as 2 fireball like objects for about 6 or 7 minutes.   My wife and I finally went out back and saw 1 of these objects moving from north to south towards Mt. Hood.   As I tried to get my phone on video mode the object changed colors several times.  Yellow, orange, red, and a blueish color.  It also began to do what I can only describe as jumping back and forth at a very high rate of speed before moving further south and descend straight towards the ground and disappearing. Before my wife and I made it to the back yard my daughters have described them as 2 fireballs that would compare in size to a very large and bright star.  Both girls have said that the 2 were doing circles in coordination across from each other.  They also saw them change several colors as I described.  From the begining to the end I would say around 10 minutes and begining at the Mt. St. Helens area and ending in tue direction of Mt. Hood.   These fireballs were very fast and moved like nothing I have ever seen before.  I would really like to know what we are all seeing. I hope this was enough and that one day we will all know.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Fiery glowing object seen in Vancouver, WA.;2012-11-14 17:30:00;30 seconds;Fiery glowing object seen in Vancouver, WA. Me and my boyfriend were coming home from school, and were waiting at the bus stop.  All of a sudden, my boyfriend tells me to look up I do and see an almost meteorite object drifting quickly through the sky.  The object was traveling just as fast as a meteorite, only it lasted much to long, and was almost zooming by.  The object it's self seemed to be round in appearance, and was darker than the dusk sky.  My boyfriend says there were red bits peeling off and trailing behind it. A minute or so later, there was a numerous amount of planes circling the area, almost as if searching for the aircraft. I'm a strong believer in the paranormal, although my boyfriend is much more logical.  Even he can't come up with a logical explanation, and, although hesitantly, agreed it was a UFO.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Floating red orange objects.;2012-11-14 17:30:00;3 minutes;Floating red orange objects I was driving home from work around 5:15 p.m. or 5:30 p.m. and I saw several (maybe 50) objects about 40-50 feet up that looked a bit like a stream of luminarias floating over SR 500. I was driving east, they were moving from north to south over an area near the Vancouver Mall and the onramp to I-205 southbound. I'm a journalist with a science writing background.  I don't know what these objects were.  I had thought they were perhaps some sort of display from the mall, but sources there said there was nothing going on that night. We've had one other report via email to the paper of another person seeing them over I-205 maybe a half hour or so later.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

I have never seen anything like it and it totally freaked me out.  We tried to get a picture with a cell phone but could not get a clear one since we were driving. I know we were not the only ones who saw it, tons of cars on the road.  My 35 year old son and I were coming from his doctor appointment headed towards KFC for dinner.  I know we are both sane but as I said before it freaked me out and I wonder what they were, there were so many of them.

At approximately 20:50, myself and one other witnessed an orange orb shoot straight up over Portland, 10' west or Orion on a NW course.   Once it was out of site a second one appeared and took the same path.  Each one took approximately a minute or less to go out of view.   As the second orb was to go out of view, the second appeared with a red light as if to signal the second and then both were gone.   No sonic boom or FAA lights on either craft.
