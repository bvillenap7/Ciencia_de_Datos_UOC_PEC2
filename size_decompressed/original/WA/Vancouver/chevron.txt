V Shaped object moving westward at 23:43 pm on June 28, 2001 in Vancouver, Washington;2001-06-28 23:43:00;20 seconds;V Shaped object moving westward at 23:43 pm on June 28, 2001 in Vancouver, Washington 6/29/01 To:		    UFO center.com From:		((name deleted))   Vancouver, Washington At 11:43pm, June 28, 2001, I observed a pale, white, V-shaped line of light directly overhead and moving slowly westward.  There was no sound, and it seemed to be at high altitude.  The V formed a 90 degree angle, and was moving point first.  It was approximately the size of a quarter, held at armâ€™s length.  This object remained in view for about 10 seconds.  As soon as the first object faded from view, I noticed a single bright white point of light in the same area where the first one faded from view.  It moved slowly Southward and was over the SW horizon in about 10 seconds. The sky was clear with a half moon to the west. There were no aircraft in the area at that time. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found him to be seemingly quite serious and credible.  PD));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
