Three rotating lime green orbs emitting green light beams. What we witnessed in Vancouver Washington started with the sighting of the green orbs that appeared to pulse, and or, rotate. Then, approximately 10 minutes later the beams appeared to be connecting to each orb.  I was really surprised to find this other report that occurred the same night so similar to ours.  I was revisiting our old report today from 12 yrs ago to see if anyone had added anything over all the years and there was nothing new on your site , and then googled ufo sightings august 1999 and found the wisconsin incident.  This is fascinating to me because I´ve never heard of a sighting like ours before, but, these people experienced the same thing, only two hrs. before us, clear across the country.  Also, on August 13th 1999 at 22:15 in Montecello Iowa, someone reported  to your site a green ball streaking across the sky.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
No shape to craft since distance was too great.  From my location in east Vancouver.  Compass direction of aprx. 140 degrees. Elevation;2001-09-07 20:54:00;5 - 7 sec.;No shape to craft since distance was too great.  From my location in east Vancouver.  Compass direction of aprx. 140 degrees. Elevation was aproximately 70 degrees.  Direction of travel is estimated at 150 degrees moving from north to south. First noticed a faint light appearing to be a satelitte.  The light quickly grew to the size of a penny held at arms length.  The light was similar to the landing lights on a commercial airliner at aproximately 5 miles out and coming straight on.  The light diminished as quickly as it appeared to the point that it resembeled a high orbit satellite and disapeared from sight very quickly.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Three light orange oval objects moving across the sky eastward just south of Vancouver;2010-07-04 23:55:00;1 minute;Three light orange oval objects moving across the sky eastward just south of Vancouver After we ended our fireworks show, I turned to the south and noticed three light orange oval objects moving across the sky eastward.  They continued eastward across the horizon, until my sight was blocked by tall trees and houses.  My first thought was that these objects might be hot air balloons because they seemed to hover/drift like hot air balloons.  Then, I realized that didn't make sense--they moved much faster than hot air balloons.  Since they appeared to be a fair distance away, I then assumed they might be planes from Portland airport or the military base nearby.  Although, I didn't know how far away they were, they seemed to be too close together to be planes (I'm guessing 1-2 miles apart).  The color of these objects never changed, and no other lights or anomalies were seen.  Also, I never heard any sounds other than a few final fireworks going off or voices of our guests leaving. ((NUFORC Note:  Evening sighting.  We have amended the time above, to reflect that fact.  PD));45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Five red glowing oval lights hovering and slowly moving;2012-04-22 01:00:00;8 minutes;five red glowing oval lights hovering and slowly moving I stepped outside while I was at work, to have a cigarette. I looked into the sky to see if it was cloudy, because I was expecting to see clear weather. It was a little cloudy.  I looked to the south from where I stood, and saw an interesting red, glowing, oval shaped light hovering in place. At first I didn’t know what to make of it, then, two other unidentified flying objects appeared from the distance hovering not far from one another. It was like a light bulb slowly lighting into clear view. I walked into the house to get my camera phone as quickly as possible. When I returned back outside they were still there. I took a couple shots of them, and tried to get some video of these objects. After about a minute or two, another pair of theses interesting lights slowly illuminated at a further distance from the others, and one started slowly moving in random directions, but always returned to its original position. I took a couple more photos after the last t! wo arrived. The first three objects that appeared,  begins to veer off out of my sight till they were gone. The other two started slowly moving further above the first three, then, they dimmed away like a dyeing bulb. The pictures I took did not do any justice to what I saw. In the photos you can see one small red light along with two other lights that turned out white. In another one you can see the first three of them and they all are white. I am not sure why all but one turned out white, but what I saw was that they were all glowing red. The last ones I took with all five of them together didn’t turnout so great. The last two to show up did turn up in the pictures. I’m assuming it was because they were further away in the distance. As for the video, my hands were very shaky from the excitement of this event, and ended up with an 8 second video that was very shaky. About myself, I am a caregiver for develop mentally disabled adults.  I have been a caregiver for the past ten plus years.  As far as believing in the supernatural, I want to believe, and this is the first encounter I have ever experienced. I don’t know if there is any explanation for this or not, but I saw this and it was very incredible.  I’ll probably never see this kind of event again, so I took some subpar pictures to prove it.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Orange lights over Vancouver, WA.;2013-11-09 23:05:00;10-15 minutes;Orange lights over Vancouver, WA. Possible UFO sighting on November 9, 2013, at approximately 11:05 pm in Vancouver, WA.  My partner and I were traveling northbound on I-5 in Vancouver, WA, at 11:05 pm Saturday evening.  My partner noticed 6 orange lights in the sky (four in a diamond shape and two more off to the side). He asked me if noticed the lights, and if so, if I had any idea what they were.   As we continued to travel up I-5, I asked him to pull off the freeway so we could get a better look.  At this time, I looked up the number for the UFO sightings network. My partner got out of the car while I made the phone call.  The objects were glowing  an orange color with blue and white twinkling lights on the bottom.  The objects moved from east to west and seemed to go out of sight when they hit a certain point in the sky.  By the time we parked (approximately 5-7 minutes after the first sighting, there were only three objects present.  They did not seem to travel in any specific order or formation, but continued to “drop” lights or sparks from the bottom of the object. We watched the objects until we could not see them anymore.  We noticed other people watching the objects as well.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

Saw 2 shooting stars and sat down to look at stars.;2019-08-04 04:32:00;4 minutes;Saw 2 shooting stars and sat down to look at stars. What at first appeared to be bright star suddenly popped up.  It was oval shaped and had red and white and green fast moving lights, much much faster than a plane.  It wobbled in a very strange way and sort of seemed to drunkenly stagger around in its movements and then moved slowly away in the opposite direction.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
