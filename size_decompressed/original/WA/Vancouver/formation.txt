Two formations looked like fireballs in two lines moving very slow and slowly disappeared one and two at a time until none were seen. lasted 30 minutes.  Seen from Briarwood street looking into the NE sky above the Cascade movie cinemas.  The glowing was constant fire orange but not really bright because they seemed far away and higher than small planes but lower than big jets that land at PDX.  It looked like aliens wanted to watch our Fort Vancouver fireworks because it was at the same time. OMG it was amazing!  No sound was heard.  Way too high and big to be lanterns.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385

We come outside and look to the sky like always, just waiting to finally see something, since there has been rumors all around town of strange activity in the skies, just a lot of activity rather than strange.  While we are gazing, we notice something quite peculiar. What we first saw was what we thought was merely a formation of 3 commercial planes, but there was something strange about it.  They were completely horizontal and on the same plain. Also they were the exact same distance from eachother.  They looked liked 3 separate blinking red lights in the sky, off in the distance.  Then we all started to realize that it looked as if it was one huge craft, rather than 3 independent ones. Also it was relatively low to the ground and not going up or down, just staying level and moving forward.  A few strange details are that the nearby airplanes that use the Portland international airport did not have any changes in their flight patterns.  They didn't wait for it to leave or wait for possible clearance to land, which is strange because it was so close to the airport.  But it makes me think that it could have been under the radar. So only civilians saw it. On a last note, we are not the only witnesses in town to see this event.  We got onto a local reporters Facebook website and noticed that someone reported the exact same event as us.  There are many new reports coming out of Portland, Oregon.  So please watch the area:-)     PS : we had strange things happen to our satellite signal later that night.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Rotating glinting swarm at high altitude.;2014-08-09 19:51:00;5 minutes;Rotating glinting swarm at high altitude. Looking westward the first sighting was a black dot to the naked eye at appprox 60 degrees above ground level, almost as small a dot as the eye could see, blue sky with just some wispy cirrus clouds way up. Then a flash of reflected light off two solar panel type things as it rotated gave it a sense of being a satellite but then twenty to thirty more of the tiny tiny flashes of rotating panel type things in a swarm made us realize it was maybe low enough to be in the blowing wind, then maybe they were balloons? but they didn't move all in the same direction, though all were going geographically south. They seemed to school like fiish would. Based on the glint of light. Then, here were two more straight above us with yet that peculiar effect of almost leaving a dash of jet contail on their movement.  But moving away also south like drifting with the others. The distance south is what seemed to remove them from view though we could see 747's leaving contrail further south, so either they were tiny drone size in a lower swarm or way higher. Is it possible for a cross-section of the opposite night sky, say, New York City in the dark on the opposite coast, to projecti itself and satellites onto our sky our cirrus clouds in the west?  If you took a pin-hole camera of the eastern night sky view and projected it and every one of 30 satellites thru the pinhole onto our daylight sky that's what it could have been.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
Three bright lights in formation.;2015-03-09 21:00:00;20 minutes;Three bright lights in formation. Formation of 3 bright orbs seen from SE Portland. My wife, son and I observed what looked like bright aircraft lights over east Portland, in the vicinity of Rocky Butte. As we watched it, we saw that it was actually three lights, moving in various formations: triangular, horizontal, and almost vertical.  They was moving very slowly in the beginning.  Two of the lights departed to the east and were lost from view, while one appeared stationary to the west of Rocky Butte for several minutes before flying east as the others had done.  My son recorded the lights on his cell phone camera for several minutes. what we saw is very similar to a Portland sighting reported February 15, 2015.;45.6636952164009;-122.577728929385
