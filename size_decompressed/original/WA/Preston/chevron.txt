Blue and red double chevron seen over I 90, Washington State.;2015-02-12 23:40:00;1-2 minutes;Blue and red double chevron seen over I 90, WA. 2/12/15   11:40pm  Driving east on I-90 (70mph), approaching Preston, WA.       Visualization of lights in sky appearing to be somewhere over North Bend or Snoqualmie, WA heading west over I 90. Lights formed two chevrons-one above the other.  Each light =4x size of a star seen with naked eye.  Each chevron was composed of two blue lights for its right half, and two red lights for its left half.  Therefore, I saw 4 blue lights on right and 4 red lights on left heading toward my location.  They seemed to be flying at the altitude of the red warning beacon on one of the mountain tops, but each single light in this grouping was 3x size of a beacon. Color was remarkable.  Couldn’t figure out what it was.  Never seen anything in the sky that large with SUCH COLOR.  Deep, intense, cobalt blue lights formed the right half as it approached (which made it on the left as I looked at it).  Bright red lights formed its left half.  As it moved further west, the blue lights turned completely off and then on again.  Not at quick, even intervals as you’d see with a strobe light.  It was slower and random.  Before it passed over the left (north) side of my car, this blue-lights-off-then-on occurred probably 5 times. Co-worker saw similar lights while still in Issaquah, WA.  Worker said the lights were green, remained stationary, then moved off and away sideways (south?).;47.5383;-121.9299
