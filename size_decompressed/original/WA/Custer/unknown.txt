Partically delta-shaped object with two very bright forward lights.;2014-11-27 21:30:00;45 second;Partically delta-shaped object with two very bright forward lights. We were traveling south on Valley View Road at 9:30, right after Thanksgiving Dinner.  It was very rainy and overcast.  My passenger pointed out lights in the sky.   At first I thought it was a bright moon peeking through the clouds but then it became apparent that it was two very bright landing lights (the brightest I’ve ever seen) and we were at least 20 miles away from the nearest commercial airport.   It drifted down to my left and for its size (I would say it was at least 75 feet long) made absolutely no sound.  There were no other cars on the road at that moment and the only sound was the rain on the windshield.  It had some small lights on its belly.  It was somewhat delta-shaped but it appeared to have two sections carved out of its tail giving the impression of wings but it was still one solid object.   It followed the tree line, floating majestically over it, banked and then descended into a field on the other side of the tree line.  I doubled back to see if I could get another better glimpse of it, but it was gone. Since this sighting was so close to the Canadian border, is it possible that ICE has drones of that size that make absolutely no sound--like battery powered motors that don’t announce themselves when making drug busts?;48.9411;-122.6215
