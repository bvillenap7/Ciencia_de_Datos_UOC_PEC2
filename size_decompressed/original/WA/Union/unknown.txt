6 red lighted objects seen flying over Hood Canal near Alderbrook Resort in Union WA.;2012-06-24 23:00:00;4 minutes;6 red lighted objects seen flying over Hood Canal near Alderbrook Resort in Union WA. While traveling east, towards Belfair, on Hwy 106 near Union WA we spotted 4 bright, steady, red lighted objects in the sky flying across Hood Canal. The red lights seemed to be on the outside of the objects and it was difficult to tell the shape of them because of the distance away from us. These objects seemed to fly evenly spaced apart but not really in any sort of formation. We watched as we were traveling and then pulled off the road at Alderbrook Resort. We saw the 4 objects disappear into the sky and seem to become dim, white lights in the background. Within about 30 seconds 2 more objects appeared flying in the same direction as the others. One soon disappeared, becoming a dim, white light near where the other 4 were. The 6th object traveled further on away from the others heading north east. Within a minute or so it also disappeared into the sky appearing to be a dim, white light in the background. While our vehicle was stopped one of us got out and! was not able to hear any sounds coming from the objects. The entire event took approximately 4 minutes from the time we spotted the red lighted objects.;47.3378;-123.0688
