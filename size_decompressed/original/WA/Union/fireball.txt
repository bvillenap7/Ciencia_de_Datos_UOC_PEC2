Bright Green Fireball Above Hood Canal;2004-04-09 02:30:00;5 seconds;Bright Green Fireball Above Hood Canal I was sitting on the east facing deck of a house overlooking Calm Bay in Union, Hood Canal and coming from the moon south of me was a low bright green ( the color of a sprite bottle) with a bright yellow tail. The tails end was orange. The fireball was low ( about 1/4 mile up, I think), and travelled almost parallel to the ground and slowley decending toward Sisters Point to the EastSouthEast. It decended for about 5 seconds, then just disappeared. It looked like if it had continued its trajectory for a couple of more seconds, It would have hit Sisters Point. About 4 minutes later, the waves got larger like a boat had passed, but I could not see nor hear any boat.;47.3378;-123.0688
