The sky was blue, and open without cloud cover.  I was moving slow with traffic when I saw an extremely bright white light moving extremely fast across the sky from left to right, or East to West.  It was moving so fast I thought it was a meteor.  The light then changed from bright white to extremely bright green, and then disappeared.  It traveled over the mountain where I live, well above the horizon and in a horizontal line or possibly a slight decent.  The total time I saw it was about two seconds (2 seconds).  The shape appeared triangular.  There was no debris, no contral like a plane, and no flames.  The white light seemed to trail behind it momentarily then it turned bright green and disappeared.  I searched the sky and could not find anything at all, it was gone.;47.6484;-117.191
