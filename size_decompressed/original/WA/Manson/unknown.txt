Bright light over the horizon dropped and then disapeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2010-06-12 22:00:00;one hour;Bright light over the horizon dropped and then disapeared A friend and I were sitting in a hot tub on Lake Chelan...  We got in at around 9pm and out around 10pm.  When we first got in I asked her if she thought a very bright light over the horizon on the West side of the lake (we were staying on the north end of the lake directly across the water from the state park) was a planet or a plane... after watching it for about 10 minutes I realized it wasn't moving.  It was much bigger and brighter then a start.   About an hour later I realized the light had dropped to right above the horizon.  I asked my friend to quickly look.  She suggested it had dropped because the earth was moving.  I had to correct her and tell her that it dropped too fast for it to be the earth rotating.  Then 30 seconds later the light dropped completely behind the horizon and was gone.  It was like watching a really fast sunset.   I never saw the initial drop from the original position, I just noticed that it had moved and then quickly after that w! as gone.  I would not like to be contacted, I just thought this info might be helpful to someone. Thanks!
