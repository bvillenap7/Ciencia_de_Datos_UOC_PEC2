Unidentified object fades from sight above Lake Chelan near Manson WA;2011-07-04 21:40:00;6 seconds;unidentified object fades from sight above Lake Chelan near Manson WA On the evening of July 4, 2011,  my granddaughter took these pictures.  The first one had an object that was clearly not the crescent moon.  She was facing to the west from the deck of our second story condo.  She looked at the instant feedback on her Exilim Casio digital camera and noticed the white spot.  She immediately took a follow up picture that showed something fading in the same location.  She was simply taking a picture of the sky originally, not the object.  The photo was taken outside so there is no window glare.  There were no fireworks allowed on the resort so that should eliminate that possibility   I blew these up on my computer and noticed something of unusual shape inside it.  The second photo shows an object in that same position (6 seconds later) that appears to be fading.  Her time on the camera setting is obviously off when right clicking preferences but notice the time lapse between them.;47.8997;-120.1497
Very bright, round light appeared instantly and receded.;2013-08-16 22:20:00;15 seconds;Very bright, round light appeared instantly and receded. Was outside looking at stars. In the matter of a fraction of a second, a large very bright round light (if you were to hold a silver dollar at arms length), appeared in the East.   It stayed stationary for approximately 10 seconds or so.   Within the span of about 5 seconds, it receded, diminishing in size dramatically, until it was the size of a pin prick and then gone.  It did not move sideways, but rather backwards.;47.8997;-120.1497
