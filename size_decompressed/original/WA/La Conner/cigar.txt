This appeared to be lights in a single line between LaConner and Burlington.  They would be at around 500 feet from the ground.   I didn't count them but there were approximately 15 of them and they looked like windows in a very large flying object that was hovering.   My daughter just called and said the object was still in the same place.   In relation to a full moon it would take around 30 of these lights to obscure the moon.
