Four fishing vessels aprox. 50-60 miles off the west coast of Neah Bay Washington watched for aprox a half an hour.  What appeared to be a discuss shaped large object with very bright lights.  Mostly white lights but also red and green that seemed to be mimicking the vessels running lights for navigational purposes.  The object would move at extreme rates of speed back and forthe in a horizontal direction then ocasionaly at a high rate of speed straight up into the sky. The object seemed to hover above one of the vessels in particular.  The object went straight up into the sky and was gone.  I was told this by several of the eye witneses. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  If the events occurred as described, we do not know what the witnesses observed.
