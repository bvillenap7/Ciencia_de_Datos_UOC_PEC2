Two triangle shaped green and pink craft seen flying in a mist from east to west;2003-06-15 23:00:00;5 seconds;Two triangle shaped green and pink craft seen flying in a mist from east to west Two Crafts were seen flying from East To West over Douglas County Wa. While a family was laying out in their backyard. The objects were flying in military type order, side by side, with one slighty ahead of the other. The colors were green and slightly off red(pinkish). The colors were off because they looked like a mist or fog was moving with them covering each up. The speed of these crafts flying over must of been fast(between 3-5 seconds). Father estimated them at at between 1000-1500 mph(comparing them with jets that usually fly over from Seattle). The heighth of these objects was hard to estimate but we could tell they were below the stars out because it was perfectly clear out. The size of these crafts was estimated at being larger than a football field.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
Black triangle spotted over home after I heard loud lets fly by my house.;2010-04-14 02:30:00;5 min;Black triangle spotted over home after I heard loud lets fly by my house. Around 2:30 am I was awoken by what sounded like 2 or 3 military jets roaring by just outside my window. There is no base around Wenatchee so we rarely see military aircraft.  When I looked out the window I saw a the wavy distortion that you would expect from something extremely hot. Like a hot road distorting the scenery on the horizon.  But I saw no lights or planes in the darkness. I laid back down and stared up at the stars through my skylight, which is apprx. 8' x 8' in size. Around 10 min. later, I saw a classic black triangle floating silently above my house.  Perfectly framed in my skylight as if planned. I could see it blacking out the stars behind it more than I could actually see the craft, but it was a definite triangle.  Moving quite slowly. Nobody I have asked, around town, saw it. My girlfriend woke up to the jet sounds but nobody else seems to have heard it.  Which I find hard to believe because it was insanely loud. There was also a little spot plane circling the area of my house for about 30 min before the sighting and an hour after, which is very strange.  I never see or hear planes circling that late. And I live by a small airport. That's about it, really.  I have seen several ufos over the years but never the infamous triangle!  I feel like part of an exclusive club now.  It was creepy though.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
3 lights in a triangle shape that were different color from the stars.;2013-08-13 03:00:00;a few minutes;3 lights in a triangle shape that were different color from the stars. While watching for meteors, I  looked south toward the Colockum noticed a triangle of lights that were closer than stars and a different color.   Then one by one the lights turned off.   There was no sound.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
Bright blinking Christmas colored light from fixed position, triangular shaped object on western horizon.;2014-09-26 20:00:00;3+ hours;Bright blinking Christmas colored light from fixed position, triangular shaped object on western horizon. This summer our family noticed 2 unusual red dots at night on the southwestern horizon.  They were parallel and in a fixed position.   Tonight at about 8:00 p.m. we noticed an object on the western but slightly more northern position along the horizon looking from east wenatchee towards highway 2.  The object is fixed and visible with the naked eye.  It is blinking red, green, blue, yellow and orange and resembles the light emitted from a welder regarding intensity.  We viewed it through both binocs and our telescope and we're able to observe its triangular shape.  It looked like Christmas tree lights hanging out in mid-air.  Did not appear to move which is highly unusual for any object in the sky, aside from stars of course, and it appeared to be well within our atmosphere.  It lasted until about 10:15 p.m.. As our family was observing it, my wife said that she also observed something last year in the middle of the night, but was too frightened to talk abou! t it at the time.  She said that she was awakened by a powerful low frequency humming sound directly over the top of our house.  It lasted about 8-10 seconds then just disappeared.  She said it was definitely not a plane.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
