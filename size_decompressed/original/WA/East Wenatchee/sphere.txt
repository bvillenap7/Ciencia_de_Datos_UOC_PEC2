Black sphere moves and hesitates in sky before joining two others.;2004-06-24 20:00:00;20 Minutes;Black sphere moves and hesitates in sky before joining two others. First spotted one spherical object black in color above East Wenatchee, Washington. Object slowly rose higher in the sky, then moved right to left steadily. Object stopped high in sky and held position for approx. 10 minutes. At one point the object seemed to rotate or turn because the sun reflecting off it blinked. Object then moved steadily and fairly fast given it's height, this time from left to right. At that point 2 other objects which also appeared to be black spheres approached the first sphere from different points and took a triangle formation. The 3 objects moved slowly away from and then towards each other while still creating a triangle shape, then moved in their original formation steadily to the north and out of sight. The objects were very high in the sky, hard to find at times. Another witness (my friend) with better eyes then myself (I wear contacts) could see them more consistanly as they moved away. My 13 year old son also witnessed the event. There was no sound or contrails present.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
