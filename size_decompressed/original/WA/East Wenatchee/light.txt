When it passed overhead it broke in two and continued on, and broke into other pieces. The object which was a ball of light that had an orange center and a red haze around it, was approx. 4,000 ft. up because it just barely cleared the mountains (Cascades? Leavenworth area), as it was traveling from west to east, at a constant speed, little faster than a cessna.  As the object was overhead, it broke into 2 pieces.  The second piece broke away at a 90 degree angle and remained at a distance approx. 500 ft. from the first object and continued parallel through the sky.  Both objects sent smaller objects toward one another and continued east when we lost the object over badger mountain. The sky was clear, no clouds, it was night.  There was another aircraft in the vicinity but it was not chasing the object.  The object produced no noise, no tail and no sparks. The other witness, contacted the local airport and was informed that nothing was seen. I contacted McChord Airforce base in Tacoma, WA and was told to contact the local police.  I have also contacted MUFON and no answer has ever been given.  I can tell the difference between an object re-entering the earth, like a rocket or falling satelite, this object maintained this altitude, and there was no tail at all. I have an AAS degree, with a major in engineering and computer science. I would like an explanation of what we saw.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
Six glowing orbs hovered for 20 minutes above Columbia River at twilight.;2003-07-04 21:00:00;20 min.;Six glowing orbs hovered for 20 minutes above Columbia River at twilight. My husband and I live in East Wenatchee, WA, high up on a hill with a full view of the Columbia River and the other (Wenatchee) side, with the foothill mountains behind it.   On July 4, 2003, at twilight (approx. 9:00 pm), we looked outside to see if it was dark enough for the local fireworks show yet.  To our astonishment we saw six glowing orange orbs hovering about 1,000 feet above the middle of the river, with the mountains as a backdrop.   We stared at this for the twenty minutes this loose, uneven hanging string formation staying there.  They were hovering, not falling like flares.  They stayed at the same altitude, some of them moving left to right slightly.  The one at the bottom actually winked out, and came back a few moments later.   These lights became clearer as it got darker.  We wished we had a video camera.   Two next door neighbors saw the lights, exclaiming What are those lights!?, and running back inside.  We continued to watch from inside our house, when suddenly, after 20 or so minutes in the same spot, they suddenly all winked out, and disappeared.   We have never seen this again.   Please excuse the late reporting of this.  We finally got a computer!;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
Strange light over East Wenatchee Washington;2005-10-10 22:08:00;20 min;Strange light over East Wenatchee Washington At about 10:08PM I looked into the night sky and noticed a yellowish bright light,  This light was much brighter and a different color than other stars that I could see.   The light stayed in one place and appeared to hover around a little and changed brightness some.  The light dimmed out and made an erratic left and dissapeared.    As I am writing this my wife just said it reappeared, second sighting is at 10:40.  This time the light is to the south and just hovering around. through the binoculors it seems to be a bright white with some red.  I really doubt this is any type of plane because it isn't moving in any direction what so ever.   10:47pm light just dimmed and dissapeared with all the stars still visiable.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
Deep red light flying south due northeast with a paused flight pattern.;2013-10-31 22:13:00;4 minutes;Deep red light flying south due northeast with a paused flight pattern. On 10/31/2013 at precisely 22:13 my girlfriend went outside to smoke and she instantly called for me to come outside.   To the south of my position was a deeply red colored object flying northeastern bound.  The object's flight path was very stable but halfway through the event it paused for approximately 6-10 seconds then proceeded on its way at roughly the same amount of speed.   The light started to fade momentarily, illuminated back to original brightness and then vanished.   There was no noticeable noise from the object at any point of the event.   I look to the south and see a commercial or military aircraft approaching.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
Stationary orange light over ridge above Malaga, WA.;2014-12-25 19:35:00;2-3 minutes;Stationary orange light over ridge above Malaga, WA. Stepped out on my porch and saw what I first thought was a star low in the sky above the ridge across the Columbia River.  My first thought was Sirius because it was sort of blinking quickly like that star does, only it was staying the same orangish color.   It was about three times the size of Venus and a bit more orange than Mars, and it was stationary in the sky.   I called my daughter out to see and as we were looking at it, it slowly got smaller and disappeared.  This was in almost the same area as the two gold balls of light I reported on 2/25/14.  This area is where the big power lines come up from Rock Island Dam.   Duration of sighting:  about 2 minutes.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
Two gold balls of light above Malaga as seen from East Wenatchee;2014-12-25 22:10:00;30 seconds;Two gold balls of light above Malaga as seen from East Wenatchee. My porch has a good view of southeast.  A gold ball of light came up from behind the hills above Malaga, just about directly below Sirius.  It was about half again the size of Sirius from my perspective.  It floated straight up, then drifted off to the left a bit.  It was turning a darker red and fading out and then took off at an angle going up and to the right.   Not a minute later another gold ball floats up from the same area and then turns darker and makes a 90 degree angle to the left for about 4-5 seconds, and disappears.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
Orange pulsing light.;2019-03-01 19:12:00;10 seconds;Looking to the SSW saw an orange pulsing light moving upwards at an angle, then moved straight to the right then disappeared.  This is the third time I've seen something like this in this area in the last 4 or 5 years.  Roughly above the area of Malaga, WA, across the river.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
