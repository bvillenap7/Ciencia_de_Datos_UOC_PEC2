To whom this may concern:     RE: UFO sighting   I was standing outside in Wenatchee, WA, 98801 at 21:45 on 28 MAR 09, having a cigar with my friend, looking up in the sky.   All of a sudden I said look up and we both saw a tube like object 20' x 50' (foot) long in low part of the sky.  It had a blue ora of lights around the object with white light in the center.  It appeared that the object turned its lights on for about 2-3 seconds then it turned off.  It had to be traveling approximately mach 5.  All I can say it was incredible and if I would not have been looking up it would have never been noticed.   I am willing to take a polygragh or be interviewed by any UFO specialist in any language (I will need an interpeter).;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
