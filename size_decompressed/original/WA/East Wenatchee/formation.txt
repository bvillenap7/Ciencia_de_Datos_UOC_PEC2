She looked out the window toward the south and observed the truck, possibly a city or county vehicle, moving very slowly. Subsequently, she noticed a big round object suspended motionless above the house across the road, where the truck had just passed. The object emitted no light, but was visible in the ambient light of daybreak. It was brown in color. Estimate of its size was bigger than a washing machine but smaller than a car. She is unsure of the object's height, but it was certainly above streetlight height, and definitely not way up there.  In addition to this object, she noticed a string of flashing lights at the same apparent altitude as the big round object, extending in a line eastward. She sensed that these lights were somehow associated with the object. She's unsure of their number, but that there were multiple flashing, separate lights. They were about the same size as streetlights and were yellowish in color.  She observed these objects for approximately 5 minutes, and had no idea what they could be.There were no noticeable sounds associated with them. At no time did she see any of them move however, after a brief trip into the kitchen, when she returned and looked outside again, they had completely vanished!;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
