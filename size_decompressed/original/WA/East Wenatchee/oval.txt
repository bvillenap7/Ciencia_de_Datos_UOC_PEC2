Huge bright orange glowing ship in the sky last night.;2015-05-27 23:00:00;3 minutes;Huge bright orange glowing ship in the sky last night. Me and my friend were hanging out outside of my parents back yard. It was very clear sky's last night.  We stood up to check out some stars when we noticed something that wasn't a star it was glowing very bright orange it was moving slowly to the left in the sky, then it went vertical towards space, picked up speed and just cruised out to space very effortlessly.  The shape was almost oval but it had other parts attached to it.  You could see it clear as day it was some kind of huge space ship. It was incredible.   The other strange thing is right after the ship took off military helicopters showed up in the same area not even a minute later.  And when we looked towards the mountains, me and my friend noticed the big lit cross that sits on a hill had suddenly turned off.  It was all very strange.   Me and my friend both witnessed it.;47.4162000000001;-120.2719
