A silent small light moved from horizon to horizon really fast, in about 10 seconds time;1995-06-15 22:20:00;about 8 seconds;A silent small light moved from horizon to horizon really fast, in about 10 seconds time My wife, my nephew and myself watched a solid white light, about half to 3/4 the size of venus when it is low on the horizon as the evening star, at about 45 degrees up from the southern horizon, move from east to west at a rate which would take it from horizon to horizon in about 10 seconds.  There was no sound.  I took the time to write and submit this.  I would greatly appreciate closure to this baffeling sighting so would you please let me know if any aircraft or satelites you know of, could move that fast?  I imagine unknown military aircraft can fly silently but THAT fast?  I KNOW meteors.  It was not one.  I can add nothing more to this information so if you're willing to comply w/my request for info, you can leave it on my answering machine or mail it to me, snail or E. Thank you.  Sincerely, name withheld at your request ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));46.9572;-122.454
