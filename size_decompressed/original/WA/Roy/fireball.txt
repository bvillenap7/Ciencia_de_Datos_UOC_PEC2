There were about 25-30 people who all witnessed this event and also others that were staying at the lake. It seemed to have caught the attention of all that were outside. suddenly high in the sky a bright blue ball of light came streaking across the sky. It turned from blue to orange then green and left a trail of light like something burning in the sky. the trail of light seemed to have lasted for about ten to fifteen minutes. None of us of all ages have ever seen anything like it and left us all wondering what the heck it was. We all thought maybe a satelite burning up in the atmosphere. we all thought for sure we would hear something 0n the news or papers but nobody has heard anything as to what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness states that event occurred on Sunday morning, August 31, at between midnight and 01:00 hrs.;46.9572;-122.454
