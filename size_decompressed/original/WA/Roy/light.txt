On 7/18/17, I was driving on a clear night around 2230 in the rural town of Roy, WA.  I saw some small bright lights that made an elongated diamond shape and then they each blinked out, except for one, which then became brighter for a moment and seemed to expel out 3 smaller lights in an arch.    Then, they just seemed to fly around a bit at odd angles and one by one disappeared.  The last one, which had expelled the other 3 stayed for a bit longer without moving but sort of pulsing it’s light and then blinked out. Lastly, they made no sound.
