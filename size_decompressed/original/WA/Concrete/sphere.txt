When she came back in she told me to look out the window. I did and we saw a large object that was bright yellow with five or six white lights shining from it. It was North West from my house in Concrete Washington. I called my mom to look at it, but she couldn't see it from her house. It started really high and as we watched, it dropped below the trees. Suddenly it started flickering, it would completely go out and then get bright again. It did this for approx. ten minutes. It then got higher again and got really bright before completely disappearing. I have never seen anything like this before or since. I do not know what a star looks like when it goes out so it might have been something like that. I asked my dad and he said it could have been a super nova, but there have been no reports of this. I have checked. ((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, and invited her to explore whether she might have been looking at Venus.  PD));48.5322;-121.6625
