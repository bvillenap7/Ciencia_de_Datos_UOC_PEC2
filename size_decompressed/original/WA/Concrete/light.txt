Bright light moving at constant speed;2004-07-19 03:00:00;one minute;Bright light moving at constant speed I was looking at stars on a clear night when I spotted an object that was just a spec of light moving in a straight line from directly above to the Northwest.  It was not moving very fast, so I thought it was a satellite.  It did not blink or twinkle.  It suddenly began growing in magnitude and got so bright it left a retinal burn that lasted a little while, maybe 5 minutes.  It kept moving without sound, never picking up speed or stopping, but soon faded into the dark.  I have no way to tell how high it was, but suspect it to have been very high, possibly in space.  This experience was quite humbling.  I waited a while to see if there were any more, but there were not, and it did not return.;48.5322;-121.6625
