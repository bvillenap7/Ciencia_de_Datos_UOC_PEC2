We were around the fire and I looked up at the stars and I saw a linear formation of lights from behind the trees. Got up to look at it in a clearing, it was fairly close at this time and it appeared to be floating. It was not making any noise, at least not that I could hear. I could not make sense of it and called my three friends over, who all saw it and were just as taken back by it, with complete inability to explain what it could possibly be. It was fairly large at first and got smaller as it slowly moved away towards the mountains. It had approximately 10 small sqaure looking white lights on it far enough apart to be distinguished from one another, but too close together to possibly be multiple satellites.  The lights appeared to rotate. I managed to get a photo, but it was much further away at this point. It was approximately one minute of all four of us getting a good look at it closer up before it moved furthe! r over the mountains and was not as easily seen.;48.5322;-121.6625
