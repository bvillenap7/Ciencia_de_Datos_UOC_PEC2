One brilliant white,blue oval/diamond shaped craft.;2012-08-06 22:00:00;45 seconds;One brilliant white,blue oval/diamond shaped craft. At 10 pm two of my children called us outside as they were stargazing, because they saw a brilliant white,blue light.  There were seven of us who saw it. It was sort of oval, almost diamond shaped.  It was traveling toward the north at a moderately slow speed, and then it changed direction moving east.  There was no sound and its motion was very smooth but sort of moving up and down.  It seemed like it was rounded on top but the brilliant light seemed to flair which is why I described it as a diamond shape as well.  It lasted about 45 seconds to a minute at the most and gradually faded into the east.  There was no weather phenomena taking place, it was not windy, it was a perfectly clear night.  There is a hill right in front of my house so no vehicles could have made this light.;45.8627;-122.4309
