A blue hovering sphere late at night.;2011-03-20 01:00:00;2 minutes;A blue hovering sphere late at night. The event occurred between February and April of 2011 after midnight. I went outside late that night to have a smoke when suddenly a blue sphere appears hovering up on the main road.   It was only a few feet off the ground and was the size of a basketball at a distance of approximately 400ft. (My house sets back about that far from the main road).  It moved forward slowly, zigzagged up and down slightly, moved backward and then proceeded to move forward, still slowly.  As suddenly as it appeared it ascended diagonally and zipped off above the trees, leaving a blue streak that dissipated very quickly.  The weather was clear there were no cars on the road or anything else unusual.  The color of this sphere was a brilliant blue, a blue I have never seen before.  The closest color of blue is Lapis Lazuli. This sphere gave off no glow at all, no light radiated outside of the sphere and made no sound.
