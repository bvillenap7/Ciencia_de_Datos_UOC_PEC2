He worked for a major airplane manufacturer in washington, and was over visiting.  we saw a bright light approach from east.  It was trailing fire behind it.  As it came closer it turned north and accelerated out of sight.  We went in the house to tell others, and I heard on a radio (that had police channels) a report a policeman was making to a ufo center in omak or okanoggen ( I don't remember now).  he described the thing we had seen, and reported seeing it hover over a farm near Ritzville,scaring the animals and shining lights over the buildings.  the time he reported for the event was just minutes before we had seen the object, and the distance between ritzville and our house was close to 100 miles, so the object was really moving.  We tried to report the event to our local police.  The kept asking if we had seen a burning airplane.  My uncle told them that it was not any kind of plane he knew of, and it wasn't burning, it just had a tail of flame shooting out the back.  They never really got it.  The next day the paper had a story of a meteor that had lit up the night sky.  I never new meteors could change direction or accelerate.  Shows what I know. Thanks for listening, I usually don't tell anyone about this story.;47.9389;-118.9969
