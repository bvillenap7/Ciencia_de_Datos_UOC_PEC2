We were traveling on the highway Leaving electric city near banks lake  going to soap lake to do Christmas shopping when this bright green object came across the road from water side, no sound and went in front of us about a couple telephone poles high and then  went vertical up the cliff face and then flattened out.  Then 2 yrs later, my boyfriend, my daughter 13, saw it again between Reardan and Spokane.  This time a telephone pole high and just glided across and kept going.  Bright green and no sound.  This of all times was Halloween.  I am entering this report out of curiosity as to others that might have witnessed something similar. Also, in the summer of 1990â€™s, my daughter and myself were visiting my mother and father in Wilbur Washington and we saw along with my parents a weird object in the sky and then two jets come flying in and the thing went straight up and disappeared.;47.9389;-118.9969
