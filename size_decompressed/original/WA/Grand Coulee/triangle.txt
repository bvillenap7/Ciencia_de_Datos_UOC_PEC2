Could see red and blue lights and a bright white flashing light underneath, it then proceeded North and dropped behind the Hilltop.   Watch for several minutes did not appear again until maybe 15 minutes later and was taking straight up into the air.  Didn't seem to climb to a very high altitude could barely see if my binoculars, then it shot towards the North.   I have video, and have an US Air Force friend who witnessed this with me.
