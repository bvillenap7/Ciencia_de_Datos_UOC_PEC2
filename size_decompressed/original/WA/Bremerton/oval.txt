They were in twos and singly positioned and hovering right above firework height.  It seemed as though they were trying to be like blended with the firework light or they are the government security watching our town.  Until I started staring at the one whitish-yellow light craft behind me and up in the sky about 1000 yards.   I went directly in the wide open middle of my street alone because, neighbors were in their yards doing fireworks. I stared at craft intently for a few minutes, it then started to ascend up and up and up.. til it vanished or looked like a star.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
