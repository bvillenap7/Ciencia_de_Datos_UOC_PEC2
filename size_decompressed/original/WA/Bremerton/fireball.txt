This was no aircraft;2008-12-25 05:54:00;1minute;This was no aircraft I was standing on the front porch facing north. When I looked up in the sky and saw six fireball shaped objects. moving slowly in the south east direction. they had no true pattern. I yelled for my buddy to come out and look. To witness what I was observing. (He submitted his report also). They were a good 3 or 4 hundred yards apart from each other. I would say they were at 10 to 20thousand feet up in the sky.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
These were not man made objects!!!;2008-12-25 05:55:00;10seconds;These were not man made objects!!! I was facing north. and the objects were headed south east. They were positioned in a triangular formation. They were circular in shape and had a deep orange and red color to them. I only got about ten seconds of visibility until cloud cover came. With my arm extended above my head the objects were about the size of my pinky tip. I can only guess they were between 10 and 20 thousand feet high.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
Huge red/orange fireball craft, no sound Bremerton, WA 98310;2012-03-08 19:00:00;45 seconds;Huge red/orange fireball craft, no sound Bremerton, WA 98310 While standing on my deck looking west, we often see helicopters land and take off in an old junior high field near Wheaton Way and Sylvan in Bremerton, accrossed from the library or going to Harrison Hosptial.   On 3/7/2012, I first thought I was seeing another helicopter taking off from the field, which is about 1000 yards away.  However, as the craft rose and flew closer it was extremely bright like a huge flying fireball..dark orange/reddish color but bright like fire.   The craft flew directly over us (meaning my wife who I called out to come see this..hurry hurry and made no sound whatsoever.  There were no wings or lights..just looked like a huge ball of fire.   It travelled steady and to the north east, perhaps twice the speed of an jet aircraft.  We both watched as it simply disappeared.   I do not take drugs and was not drinking... this was very real and nothing we have ever seen before.  We made a 911 report.  I'm really hoping someone else saw the event.  It also appeared that a search of the area was made by helicoptor and small plans circling after the event.   Not for sure but was out of the norm.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
