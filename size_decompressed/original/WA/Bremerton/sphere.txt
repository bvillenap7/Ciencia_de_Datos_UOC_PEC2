miniature lightning bolts shooting out of this thing, coming out in all directions.;2002-10-15 03:00:00;20 minutes;miniature lightning bolts shooting out of this thing, coming out in all directions. I woke up in in bed and looked up at the night sky through my sliding glass door and started to observe what appeared to be a large bright star. It was very bright. As I continued to watch this object I noticed that it was moving. It moved slowly in the sky heading south of Bremerton, towards Port Orchard. I noticed while watching that there were what appeared to be miniature lightning bolts shooting out of this thing,coming out of it in all directions.                                                                    This object moved upward, downward, and to both sides.I continued to watch for a good 20 minutes, until it dissapeared behind the trees, heading southwest.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
I noticed Venus in the wrong place and it was moving!;2004-09-17 05:00:00;3-4 min.;I noticed Venus in the wrong place and it was moving! Hi,  First, I drive a taxi on nightshift and I get my dates and times confused on a routine basis. It WAS the middle of last week between 4:30 A.M. and 5:15 A.M. I got home from work and parked my car facing east. I climbed out facing north and noticed that somebody had moved Venus (the Morning Star) and I thought, how did they do that?, why did they do that?, who did that? I then looked where Venus was supposed to be, and lo, there it was! So I look back and it starts darting around as if the driver is getting a feel for the controls. It was between the ladle end of the Big Dipper and the horizon when it sped away quickly enough to SEEM to blink out, however, I did note a very faint light trail. My perspective suggested a diection slightly to the right and below the lower right star at that time.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
Two pulsating objects rapidly changing colors, hovering over Bremerton Naval Base!!;2004-09-21 20:40:00;approx 8 mins.;Two pulsating objects rapidly changing colors, hovering over Bremerton Naval Base!! Ok, I'm giving this report for my friend who called me as he was watching this event through a monocular.  I will give you his email address also but for some reason he hasn't reported this as of yet.  I'm urging him to and I'm sure he will, but for now here is the info I have.  He lives in view of the Bremerton ship yard approx. a mile north from the water.  He told me tonight that this was the 3rd time he's seen this in the last couple months.  What was described to me was two balls of light, one bigger than the other, both hovering over the water and changing colors rapidly from blue to red to green to white then staying white and pulsating, then going back to rapidly changing colors.  One would move slowly to the left and then come back.  The other stayed there, hovering and moving to the left then right then holding position. The bigger one finally moved off to the left then vanished instantly, the smaller one stayed there until finally moving off and getting smaller, then gone.  I was on the phone with him while he was describing this to me. What I wrote down was this: approx. 8:40 pm to 8:48 pm on Tues. night Sept. 21st, 2004.  One big, one small, both pulsating and changing colors from blue to red to green to white, one moving off to left etc. I'm repeating myself so I'll wrap it up there.  The first time he called me after seeing these same objects was a couple months ago and I can get the details of that sighting also.  Both previous sightings he ran into the house to get his binoculars or monocular and when he returned to the deck they were gone. Tonight he had the mono with him and watched the whole time through that. I could tell he was quite impressed with what he was seeing and kept saying god, what is that, I don't know but it's not helicopters or military planes, I'll tell you that much.  Then they were gone and our conversation basically ended a minute or so after that, I told him I would send a link to your website and also report the incident myself. He agreed.  So, since I have actually sent a picture of something in to you before, I decided to report this first, and then let you pursue an email conversation with him if you wish.  His name is ((name deleted))and just for the record does not drink alcohol or take any drugs etc. Sober guy and not likely to be making this kind of thing up. I've personally known ((name deleted)) for 20 years and will vouch for that. My name is ((name #2 deleted)), I live here in West Seattle. Anyway, his email address is ((deleted)). Thanks so much and hope you find this of some use.  My next mission is to buy him a pair of those binoculars that take digital pics so maybe he can get it on film next time:-) Regards, ((name deleted));47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

Bremerton Wa.  Bright red light.  14 min. 20-30 mph.  3/5/07;2007-03-05 19:05:00;15 min.;Bremerton Wa.  Bright red light.  14 min. 20-30 mph.  3/5/07 At 7:05 PM 3/05/07 I went onto my back deck (which faces west) but was looking up to the SSE at the stars.  I saw a bright red light apparent distance 5 to 10 miles SSE and about the same size as Venus is in the western sky, proceeding north bound.   At first I thought it was a helicopter and I got out a pair of 8 power binoculars and saw no other lights.  What got my attention the most was its speed (apparent 20 to 30 mph) and no other lights and as it got closer, no sound.  It took about 14 minutes to get to just east of my house where it just disappeared.   I am an ex Air traffic controller with over 20 years of experience. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite credible to us.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  Please see other reports of same phenomenon.

2 bright lights next to each other hovering for 20 plus minutes, then vanishing to the left.;2008-06-23 21:20:00;20 min;2 bright lights next to each other hovering for 20 plus minutes, then vanishing to the left. My wife and I were outside sitting in our front lawn looking off to PSNS and the night sky and witnessed 2 extremely bright lights hovering over the shipyard/manchester area. They changed colors and moved slowly to the left and eventually disappeared after 20 min. I have video footage of this event on my digital camera. It really sent chills down my spine seeing it. Please let me know if there is anyone else out there that witnessed this event!;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
