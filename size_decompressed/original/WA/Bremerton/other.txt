My attention was directed to sudden movement of a (star).  It zipped along, then stopped dead in the sky. Lights blinking.  I was late for a meeting and could not stay to watch it further.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
Comet-like geo-stationary objects in vicinity of Ursa Major;2000-12-28 03:00:00;2 Hr 15 Min;Comet-like geo-stationary objects in vicinity of Ursa Major Looking due N, I looked upward at approx. 85 degrees and noticed what at first appeared to be two comet tails, extending NW to SE, not parallel but diverging approx. 10 degrees. Lengths approx. width of one finger at arms length. Appearance was also like the landing lights of two airplanes at great altitude reflecting on haze or ice crystals. Several minutes of continuous observation showed no movement at all against the background stars. I noted the positions relative to Big Dipper (slightly W and S (or higher)). After one hour I observed that the two light sources had not moved relative to the ground but were stationary with Big Dipper rotating CCW. After 2 1/4 hours one of the sources appeared slightly S of and between the bottom-most two stars of the ladle of Big Dipper. They had not changed position relative to the ground nor to each other. At first, the sources seemed more coherent, as if a beam of light, brightest to the L (W) and fading to the R (E). It is possible that the rightmost source was more coherent, and may have had several pinpoints or flashes of light along its length, only several, and at random. This one also appeared to have a lobed width, 2-3 lobes being suggested, but just at the limit of my vision. Over time, the sources faded slightly, or dispersed slightly, but remained exactly as when first seen in all other respects. Absolutely no motion relative to the ground. (Geo-stationary objects? At this latitude I thought it not possible to remain fixed over a position directly below.) ((NUFORC Note:  We talked to this witness and found him to be exceptionally credible.  He sounds like a highly qualified observer.  PD));47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

Dissapearing Star?  ((NUFORC Note:  Flare from an Iridium satellite, we suspect.  PD));2006-04-23 21:30:00;1/2 second;Dissapearing Star? I don't think what I saw was a UFO, But I did see something I have never seen before in the night sky>  I was out side smoking a ciggarette inbetween 8-10 in the evening.  An like usual on a clear night i always look up and wish on a star and star gaze for a few moments and a star in my general direction  (If it was a star) got imensly bright and grew in size and then dissapeared.  I know I saw this and was not under the influence of anything besides nicotene. Is their any explanation for this and has this kind of thing been seen before and if so what the hell is it?

2 crescent shapes hovering over Bremerton, WA.;2013-10-06 21:10:00;5 minutes;2 crescent shapes hovering over Bremerton, WA. A light in the sky caught my eye as I was walking up to my house.  The light moved like a football player juking to evade defenders, I had never seen anything in the sky move like this.  The light then stopped and began hovering over Bremerton, I called my wife's attention to the light approximately 1 minute after my wife started watching, a second light appeared out of thin air.  The two lights had the shape of a crescent moon.  After a few seconds, the first light dimmed and went off in to the horizon while the other light remained hovering over Bremerton.  My wife says she saw green, red and blue lights but all I saw were white lights.  Eventually the second light went into the horizons well.  The whole encounter lasted between 5-10 minutes.
