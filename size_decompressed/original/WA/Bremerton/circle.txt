Circular craft approximately 500 feet in diameter clearly seen at approximately 1500 feet altitude.;1988-10-15 02:00:00;30 minutes;Circular craft approximately 500 feet in diameter clearly seen at approximately 1500 feet altitude. October 1988  Bremerton, WA.    Approximately 02:00 am  I had to get up to take my puppy out, it was a clear autumn night, very high clouds for the Pacific Northwest at that time of year.  At the time I was living across the street from the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, so the reflected light was always bright, precluding any interference such as night time shadows or darkness. As I came around the side of the house I had a clear view to the North and South, with an effective horizon laterally of approximately 15 miles - a high ridge of hill and forest to the southwest, west, and northwest blocked any distance viewing in those directions. I immediately saw a circular craft distance from me was approximately 400 feet altitude approximately 1,500 to 2,000 feet circumference approximately 500 feet height of sidewall approximately 200 feet.    Sidewall was at an angle from bottom of craft sloping outward towards the top at roughly 25 degrees.  Circumference of bottom of craft roughly 400 feet +, bottom was smooth without any features such as seams, markings or high relief. Craft was moving at a slow walking pace from North to South it took approximately 30 minutes from the time I saw it to travel out of sight around the bulge of the hill and forest approximately 400 feet to my Southwest. Craft was not low enough to see the top of the craft over the sidewall.  It was a uniform Naval Haze Gray color overall without any features such as seams, markings or high relief on the sidewall. As I mentioned before, reflected light from the Shipyard highlighted the craft clearly without any shadows or interference.  Craft was silent and the dog appeared not to notice it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We have changed the date above, to reflect a date in mid-October 1988.

I saw a large white circular object shoot across the sky in a south east direction. It lasted for only a few seconds.  I thought it might be an airplane but there were no other lights with it.  It looked much larger than any meteor showers I've seen before.  It was about 3-4 times larger than the stars in the background and much brighter.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

As we looked toward south Seattle, there was a single  bright white light moving in erratic patterns (small circles) and various speeds;2001-08-20 23:30:00;10-15 min;As we looked toward south Seattle, there was a single  bright white light moving in erratic patterns (small circles) and various speeds with a flash of red occassionally. The first one then started heading north north-east, still doing the herky jerky and dimmed out of sight. Within  a minute there was another one about the same size, but this one had a smaller one above it copying the larger ones every little herky jerky motion. I grabbed my scope to try and get a better look at the thing. Wow, it looked like a shere of bright flashing light with beautiful red flashes about its exterior. I wish could describe it better, but I have never seen any thing like it. They followed about the same path north north-east.

Silver Daylight Disk Seen within one Hour after Airforce #1 was in the area.;2004-06-18 14:00:00;minute;Silver Daylight Disk Seen within one Hour after Airforce #1 was in the area. First I leave work early on Fridays, so on my way home on the boat I was outside on the deck playing my guitar and another guy I’ve talked to before was waking around the deck for exercise, then he interrupted me and pointed out Air force #1 flying over you know the president was at Ft. Lewis in WA today. Well it was flying from Seattle over Bainbridge Island towards over top Bremerton so I saluted it.  But here is the weird part when I was in Bremerton I left the terminal and went to get a soft Taco came back as waited outside for the Park and Ride bus, then I saw a silver disk in the clear blue crossing overtop Bremerton at about 100 miles per hour, it was clear and visible and it went over town, then over the water out to Port Orchard and kept going. But when it was over Bremerton all these people were just sitting totally oblivious to the environment around them, reading or whatever, so I pointed it out to a guy just to see his reaction and he was looking and he said, Oh it’s something the Navy Yard is doing for Surveillance, I know he’s wrong, but I tell,  Ya, these times are getting exciting.  I can’t wait for what’s coming I think it’s a good thing. It is my fourth UFO sighting, minus the time my bedroom light like daylight for no reason..;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

Light from west to east that diminished and disappeared at about a 110 degree angle;2007-04-12 22:16:00;25 seconds;Light from west to east that diminished and disappeared at about a 110 degree angle. I was watching above the Olympic mountains and saw a star about a 1/4 the brightness of Venus come from west to east across the sky above our home. I thought it might have been a satellite as the speed was similar to low orbit satellites I've seen before ( but about half again as fast). As it passed me ( about 110 degrees vertical from us) it quickly dimmed and diminished in size (i.e. rising). There was no aircraft sound and satellites I've seen before can easily be tracked across the sky with minimal change in magintude. It was definitely different.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

A helicopter flew across it's path underneath it.

A non-military helicopter heading southwest flew near and past the object, but didn't seem to notice it,   We heard the helicopter, but no noise came from the black object after the helicopter was gone.   We watched the black object continue to move to the east and upwards until we lost sight of it.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
Two red glowing circles hovering in sky on July 4th.;2010-07-04 22:35:00;8-10 minutes;Two red glowing circles hovering in sky on July 4th. On the night of July 4th, 2010 my family was outside in the front yard of my brother’s house.  It was myself, a 31 year old female and my five year old daughter, my brother and his two children ages three and five, and my parents who are both in their fifties.  We all live next door to each other  in a very rural development at the base of Green Mountain which is known locally for UFO sightings.  It was about 10:35 PM and we had just finished lighting our fireworks.  The sky was clear and we were just catching one last glimpse of the fireworks being lit by the neighbors and getting ready to round up the kids and to say goodnight.  As we were watching the eastern sky we saw a round object very similar in shape to a balloon appear and it was heading in a westerly direction.  It was mostly red with a bright orange glow on the bottom third of the circle.  At first, we actually thought that it was a helium balloon that someone had lit on fire and set free.  But, ! the object was not acting like a balloon would.  It would speed up, slow down, hover for a bit, change directions slightly and then suddenly veer off.  We watched it for about three minutes over my brother’s house and then we noticed that coming in from the south was another one exactly like the first.  This one was moving very quickly and heading right for the first one.  When it was next to the first one they hovered silently together for about five minutes before they went straight up into the sky.  Needless to say we were very disturbed but frankly we weren’t sure if we had seen a UFO or some strange balloon trick by Fourth of July pranksters.  It wasn’t until last night when my brother was fooling around on the internet and found some reports of sights that we were sure of what we had seen.  I personally have not read any other accounts or seen any videos of similar sightings, but I will be looking at them once I get this report filed to see how similar other sighting ! were to ours.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
 I saw what looked like a very bright star.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star, possibly Sirius.

I pointed it out to him, remarking how bright it was and that it was possibly a planet. After watching it for a few minutes we noticed that it was moving very slowly and white lights seemed to flash from it.  I had figured it could be a plane of some sort, but we continued to watch as a plane went through the sky.  The object we had seen was moving to slowly in a triangular pattern and was significantly higher in the atmosphere.  We watched it slowly move and flash for twenty minutes before returned inside.  Later on, maybe an hour later when I returned it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Silverdale, WA: erratically moving white lights reflecting off clouds and moving at lightening speed.((NUFORC Note:  Ad lights?  PD));2012-01-14 21:05:00;one hour+;Silverdale, Washington: erratically moving white lights reflecting off clouds and moving at lightening speed for over one hour. Three to four white lights appeared in the sky ans moved across clouds in an erratic and circular manner and extremely fast. The circular lights reflected against clouds but disappeared in cloud breaks, suggesting they were beamed upward, possibly from some form of powerful laser light. My wife and I both witnessed the event and would wish to know whether the lights were from earth or elsewhere. This will highly influence our decision to barbeque outdoors in future. We can live with the bears but not with ETs, and if its a human with some Chinese made laser gadget, we would like to give the bears his address. We are former diplomats who spent thirty seven years abroad. I saw these lights once before in Kandahar, Afghanistan in 2004.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
Orange/Amber slow moving balls fly higher and zip away;2012-07-04 22:30:00;30 minutes;Orange/Amber slow moving balls fly higher and zip away On July 4, 2012 a friend and I were standing on her back patio in Bremerton, Washington listening to the fireworks and watching them in the distance.  My back was facing North and her back was facing South. As we were talking she got really quiet and said, Look at that low flying plane.  I turned around to see what she was talking about and saw a low flying, orange/amber colored round object.  It appeared in the Northeast, coming out of complete thin air and it was traveling South. It slowly floated across the sky ascending higher into the sky.  Once it reached a high altitude, it sped up, extremely fast, and then blip, it was gone.  This lasted for about 45 seconds. When trying to catch it on camera it showed as a bright white light.  After looking at the video it was clear that the camera, in fact, did not catch anything.  But, when watching as it was recording you could clearly see that something was there. My friend went inside to get her camera, which she checked was fully charged.  After about 5-7 minutes the same ritual happened.  My friend went to record it on her camera and the battery was instantly drained.  The camera went from a full charge to nothing.  The UFO we spotted made the same flight path four times all within a 30 minute duration.  I did manage to snap a picture of it, where it looks like a small, bright, white light.  But, when looking at it from the ground with the naked eye it looks like an amber colored ball.  The direction it was coming from was not shooting off fireworks, but it traveled in the direction towards where fireworks were being shot off at.  Once the finale for the fireworks happened, no more sightings occurred.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

It was orange/red and round.  The object then stopped, went to the right, stopped, went to the left, idled for approx. 20 seconds then went straight up into the atmosphere in about 5 seconds until it was out of sight.  The object retained its color of orange/red.  It was not a plane,helocoptier, or some form of fireworks.  I've seen this type of object about 5 times over the years and it's very frustrating in that it doesn't make sense.  If these objects are from somewhere external to the earth what do they want?

This time it was huge orange in the middle and a white i guess you can say a fluffy coat on the out side. There was no moon out so i know it was not the moon.These ships or space crafts came about 2 times with in a hour same spot did not move nor had no sound, just quite. I called the navy base as i am located in bremerton and they told me nothing was in the sky at that time, nor did they see anything. Do I believe then no.. I see these objects in the sky all the time in the sky i know what they are.This may sound strange but i have dreams like i am in a ship i see eartu from afar, i see what is going to happen to us and what i dreamt last year already happen.
