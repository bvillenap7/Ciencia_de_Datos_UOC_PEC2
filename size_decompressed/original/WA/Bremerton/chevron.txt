Chevron shaped craft seen flying over PSNS in Bremerton, WA;2003-02-25 19:30:00;5 minutes;Chevron shaped craft seen flying over PSNS in Bremerton, WA On February 25th 2003 at approx. 7:30pm My husband, returning to his vehicle after work in downtown Bremerton, looked up into the sky as he was walking towards his parking space and noticed a strange looking aircraft flying directly over The Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. As he describes, this craft was a triangle/chevron shape. It had one light at each point of the ship, for a total of three lights, which did not blink, as most aircraft running lights do. The craft was at an altitude of approx. 800 to 1,000 feet, and it was moving slowly to the north. This craft made no sound, which my husband found to be quite odd, considering it was flying so low. Another observation he made was the fact that there is a strict no-fly zone in effect over the entire shipyard and naval base. Did anyone else see this?;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
Triangular/chevron shaped craft flying low over the city of Bremerton, WA;2003-02-26 22:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular/chevron shaped craft flying low over the city of Bremerton, WA On February 26th 2003, Around 10pm my husband was at our residence, outside on our deck. As he looked out at our view of the city, he noticed an aircraft hovering over the tops of the trees in the downtown area of Bremerton. The craft was triangular/chevron shaped and had 3 lights at each point of the ship. This craft was unusually low, too low to be an airplane, and it's movements did not fit with any existing technology known today. The ship was heading south-bound at a stop-and-go pace. It made no sound. This object was observed for at least five minutes before it descended verticly-upward into the clouds from a standstill/hovering position. This report coincides with a previous report sent in by us describing an incident that happened just the day before, Feb 25th 2003 over the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, in Bremerton, WA. We are curious to find out if there were any other people who had seen this craft, or reported any other strange happenings in the skies on either of those dates.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
7 to 8 white lights, moving fairly quickly, no sound noticed;2007-08-28 02:30:00;5 seconds;7 to 8 white lights, moving fairly quickly, no sound noticed I was viewing the lunar eclipse in the southern and slightly western sky through the camera lense, which was zoomed in tight revealing only the moon and barely any of the night sky.  At one point, I stepped back away from the camera to view the sky through my own eyes when I caught movement. When I focused in on the source, I saw seven to eight white lights in the shape of a chevron, moving fairly quickly in the direction of south-west, in front of and below the moon.  Considering the direction that they were traveling, they must have been much closer to me while my vision was obscurred with the camera lens, but I never heard a sound.
