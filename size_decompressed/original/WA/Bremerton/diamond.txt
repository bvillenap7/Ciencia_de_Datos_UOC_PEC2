(West Hills), I happened to look out toward the Northwest, and seen a bright white light traveling at high speed at a slight downward angle (toward earth). This bright light left no firey trail what so ever. This light was traveling out of the north (it went right over the Bangor Sub Base) with a heading of due south (traveling north to south) I watched it for one minute until it disappeared behind Green Mtn. and Gold Mtn..This happened at 7:25 P.M. (19:25) it was a very cold night 29 degrees and very clear not a cloud in the night sky.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
Large object in a possibly diamond shape emitting bright orange-yellow lights on the horizon over Puget Sound.;2012-12-20 20:00:00;4 hours;Large object in a possibly diamond shape emitting bright orange-yellow lights on the horizon over Puget Sound. I watched this very bright light over Puget Sound on the horizon all night.  At 2330, it moved to about 11 o'clock in the sky, which it got considerably smaller and the color became more of a white light.  At this point, it looks more like a star.  Perhaps the light on the horizon went away, when I changed rooms?  I went back to the other room where I sat watching it, and it was no longer there at 2330. I watched the light earlier thinking it to be a helicopter, but it sat there all night.  I do see lots of airplanes coming off that horizon, but it stayed too stationary to be an airplane. I've watched a similar light in the direction of southeast of Mt Rainier over Puget Sound just on the horizon previously.  This light was there night after night after night a month or so ago.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
Diamond shaped light, disappears and emits blue flash.;2014-10-20 20:00:00;5 minutes;Diamond shaped light, dissapears and emits blue flash Object flew over residential area. The object appeared to be star or diamond shaped.  The object was very bright.  The light was white at first and as it vanished became amber.  It cruised much lower than an airplane, was completely silent, and was only one light. skies were very clear. It flew over in a slightly curved path and vanished before it met any tree line or horizon. It took about 2 seconds to turn from a white light, to an amber light, and then no light. When it completely vanished, a light blue flash cascaded over the treetops and houses, making the topside of everything slightly blue for about one whole second.  The light seemed to come from the object.  There was no sound of thunder.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
