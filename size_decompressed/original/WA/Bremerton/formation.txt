3 bright and colorfull objects hovering in formation over Sinclair Inlet (Bremerton WA);2007-01-14 18:30:00;2 minutes;3 bright and colorfull objects hovering in formation over Sinclair Inlet (Bremerton WA) Me and my girlfriend (im 22, she's 21) were driving to the movies from Gorst WA heading North on Highway 3. We both looked over to the North East over Sinclair Inlet and saw 3 objects all in formation above the water. They were in a row over the Navy shipyard in Bremerton. They were all standing still. They all had a white light coming from the top and what looked like a red and blue light on the bottom. They had a round/saucer shape. As we drove North to Silverdale, the trees finally were blocking our view.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
Large object,.unbalanced cluster of white/green illuminated globes slowly floating across night sky at low altitude & vanished.;2017-06-08 23:00:00;1 minutes;Large object,.unbalanced cluster of white/green illuminated globes slowly floating across night sky at low altitude & vanished. I am a 47 year old female.  I live in a military based town.   I was driving across town with my friend, following a Bingo session, approx 11:30 pm.  I was not at all tired, drunk or medicated at the time I witnessed this mysterious object.  My vision is good, I have no history of unusual mental behavior, and I am not yet senile.   My neighbor was my passenger at the time.  We both saw the same thing.  It was a large object or a cluster of objects floating across the night sky.  It traveled slowly towards us steady at a low level yet still a good distance above city power poles.  Its shape shifted continuously looking unbalanced.  My best description of what it looked like would be similar to a huge group of balloons tied together w/ each containing its own glowing light, glowing brightly of green/white.  No blinking lights or sound.   I continued to drive, losing site of it due to the trees.  A few minutes later I drove back to the area stopping at a gas station to look for the! object.  The object was not seen again.  It was a Strawberry Moon that night.  It was very large and bright.  There were clouds passing/hiding view of the moon off and on, no rain w/ slightly gusty winds.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
