Disc was flying about 50 yards off the wingtip of an airliner that had just left Seatac airport.;1988-04-15 14:00:00;~ 20 seconds;Disc was flying about 50 yards off the wingtip of an airliner that had just left Seatac airport. I had just come up out of a dry dock and was walking back to my reporting area, when I heard an airplane overhead.  I glanced up and saw the airliner that had just taken off from Seatac airport, as it was at a low altitude , about 2500 to 3000 feet.  I looked back down, watching where I was walking, but had noted something odd about the airliner.  Something was flying by it.  My first thought was that there were pigeons, or seagulls flying in the air.  I stoped walking and looked up again at the airliner.  Then I saw a round disc flying about 50 yards off the airliners port wing tip.  The pilot must have seen the disc about the same time, as the airliner made a sudden turn toward the starberd side, changing its course to a north direction.  It had been flying in a westerly direction.  A moment after the airliner turned, the disc also turned in the same direction.  However, as the disc made its turn the rear of the disc dipped down and for a moment I could see the dome in the middle of the disc.  After finishing its turn the disc leveled out and cought up to the airliner.  Both continued flying in a northerely direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

VLF radio waves forms fast moving circular disk clouds.;2020-05-01 01:00:00;20 seconds;VLF radio waves forms fast moving circular disk clouds. For your information Fast moving circular clouds (caused by moist air being compressed by very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic radio waves emitted from land based naval radio stations to submarines at sea) are sometimes mistaken as UFOs.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
