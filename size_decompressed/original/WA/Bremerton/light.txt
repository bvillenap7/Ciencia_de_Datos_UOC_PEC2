3 to 7 red lights in the night sky, moving independantly of eachother. Many miles away at a 60 degree angle from horizon.;1995-07-04 00:00:00;5 minutes;3 to 7 red lights in the night sky, moving independantly of eachother. Many miles away at a 60 degree angle from horizon. It has been several years since the event so my memory of the specifics, such as date, time, and number of objects, is not clear. I was up in the Bremerton, Wa. area on a crystal clear night. It is not a big city area so there aren't many city lights to detract from the view of the sky. I was on the balcony of my apartment with my girlfriend just enjoying the evening and chatting when we both noticed several solid red lights in the sky about the size of 4 or 5 intense stars put together.  They were very far away in the sky. I would say many miles away. They were far up in the sky, probably 60 degrees off the horizon.  I do not remember the direction. And do not want to guess as it would be just that. They were, at times, in formation where they would be close together and then in a split second they would shoot off in different directions of no certain pattern or common distance.  They moved with amazing speed, with no tail, and stopped on a dime and then would change direction effortlessly. It seemed they were covering great distances because they seemed so far away and would cover 10 t0 30 degrees of sky in a matter of a few seconds. Then as quickly as they'd separated they would one by one, in no certain order, come back together (not touching) again as if to huddle. They did not pulsate. They did not change shape or color. They did not seem to move any closer in our direction but for the most part seemed to travel on a constant plain of distance.  They did however seem to move both longitudenally and latitudenally. Meaning that if someone a hundred miles away from my position was directly under them they may have appeared to have a change in depth perception. My first impression, as I mentioned to my girlfriend, was that we were witnessing and extra-terrestrial event. We were obviously surprised and in awe but not frightened. I am very much a pesemist when it comes to this sort of thing and tried in every way possible to figure a logical explanation (planes, helicopters, lasers,...etc.) but nothing I! 'd ever whitnessed made sense. I've only mentioned this to maybe 2 or 3 people and never reported it or followed up because I figured it was pointless. But I have never forgotten it. I've often wondered if there were any other whitnesses and only report it now because when I typed in UFOs Washington last week and found your site and saw the story about the mother and daughter and the red fireball it blew my mind.  I felt like I should let you guys know. I don't know what you will do with this information but I hope it helps.  I also wonder how you are able to determine if someone writing to you is telling the truth or fabricating a story. Please take this as the truth. I work in mainstream society and am very busy (I don't have time to write fairy tales on the internet). I would not share this with my associates as they would probably think I was nuts. I only do this now because it has always been stored in my memory since then and I never forget it and also because of the account I read in your site. I don't know if they're related but if they aren't it is a hell of a coinsedence.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
10-year old sites ufo above Bremerton.  She explains it as a fire in the sky.  The object moved extremyly slow.;1998-01-10 17:00:00;aproximately 5-minutes;Summary : 10-year old sites ufo above Bremerton.  She explains it as a fire in the sky.  The object moved extremyly slow. Approximately @ 5:00pm, Two 10-year old Bremerton girls explained to their mother that there was fire in the sky.  The mother replied with out looking that it was the sun setting.  They kept insisting no.  So I and my signifigant other ran to the window to see a bright light in the sky.  In the south direction.  Possibly over the Lions Park or PSNS base.  I ran back to my bedroom and grabed my binoculars.  I ran out front and looked up into the sky.  I seen to bright yellowish-orangish lights.  They did not appear to be conneceted, but decseding together.  My first thought was meters, but they traveled in unison and extremly slow.  I then tried to get an even better view and at this time they just disappeared.  I have waited to hear of the sighting on the news, but no claims have been made.  Here in Bremerton wondering?! What?!  Although my signifagant other thinks it was meters.  Then why haven't they been reported??;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

I SAW A STARSHIP!  It was July 9, 2004.  I had just pulled into my driveway, facing East, between 3:30 and 4 AM!  It was still dark and Venus was 15 to 20 degrees above the Eastern horizon, in a clear sky. I climbed out of my car, I was facing North, and saw the Big Dipper sitting maybe 30 degrees above the horizon.  There was a very bright object hovering below the Dipper and it looked just like Venus does to the naked eye!  It was also clearly outside of the atmosphere!  The light I saw was probably reflected sunlight.  I looked back East and confirmed that Venus hadn't moved and then looked back at the object.  It suddenly started darting back and forth....as if the operator was getting the feel for the controls. The object then LEFT......REALLY.....REALLY FAST!  It left a light trail reminiscent of the Starship Enterprise without the rainbows!  It did not 'blink' out of sight, it just sped away and its trajectory, from my perspective looked like it was headed for Marek, the lower right star in the Dipper.  This is the event that convinced me 100% that interstellar travel IS possible and IS occurring!  I have no way of knowing whether ET was driving or if Major Nelson was driving, but if I had any say-so, I would point the planet-hunting telescopes at that star or that section of night-sky;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

A red light traveling at a slow speed was visible for 20 mintes and was seen to hover four times.;2007-01-29 18:45:00;20 minutes;A red light traveling at a slow speed was visible for 20 mintes and was seen to hover four times. It was a clear  night with an almost full moon, cold, with a stagnant air/smog alert in effect. My co-worker and I, working outside in the dark, had earlier been commenting on the brilliance of Jupiter in the southwest sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  May be Venus in the SW sky.  PD)) There was the usual busy air traffic coming and going from McCord AFB, Sea-Tac Int., and Boeing Field which we were both very familiar with.  Each airplane in the normal traffic routinely displays white, red, and green lights, frequently to be seen blinking rapidly. My co-worker first noticed a bright fire engine red colored light moving at a slower speed than the average airplane, and was not following the normal traffic approach pattern.  There were no white or green lights or blinking associated with this object. It first appeared southeast of our location moving toward the southwest from over the ridge top behind Port Orchard, WA, moved out into the open, and then from our viewpoint appeared to stop and hover over that town.  My general feeling was that it was a much greater distance away, and was not actually over the town. During the 20 minute sighting the object stopped four times, the last time it stopped for almost ten minutes.  Then it simply blinked out and was gone.  It didn’t fade into the distance as it moved, it just went out and wasn’t there any more. The sighting happed from 18:45 to 19:05.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

I watched it for about 12 to 13 minutes, till it was just behind some tall thin trees. then all of a sudden it stopped for about 6 or 7 seconds then continued a little bit, paused again, then continued on a little ways, then it just disappeared. it didn't blink, it was one solid red light. I so badly wanted to dial 911 , just to find out if there were any other calls coming in about it. A few weeks later I decided to see if anybody had reported it to NUFORC. and there it was, not one or two, but five or six reports that described the same thing that I saw! I was so relieved!

bright red light over psns shipyard.;2007-03-05 19:15:00;10 min;Bright red light over psns shipyard. At 1915 from my front yard in bremerton i saw a solid red light directly above the smokestack at psns shipyard. the object did not blink or pulse, but moved very very slow compared to any normal air traffic that frequents this area. I watched the object slowly move north not traveling a very far distance over a 10 min. period. it was from my location 30 to 35 degree from the horizon. The object to my best guess, was 3/4 from the ground to the cloud deck, this is to give a relation to it's altitude. The object stopped for aprox. 3 min, then rapidly within 1 sec dimmed then got real bright then disappeared from the sky. there were no clouds visible anywhere close to the object when it disappeared. PLEASE REFER TO MY ADDRESS TO GET EXACT LOCATION OF MY VIEW POINT. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone on two occasions.  He sounded quite credible to us.

Fast moving bluish light gliding across sky.;2007-07-08 23:30:00;2 seconds;Fast moving bluish light gliding across sky. It was nighttime on July 8, 2007, I don’t have the exact time, but I believe it was sometime after 11:30 pm PST, because my wife had already gone to bed. I was outside looking east at the Manette Bridge and the Port Washington Narrows in Bremerton, Washington,  when suddenly I noticed a small blue light traveling east towards Seattle. The light resembled the light of a high flying aircraft, but it moved across the sky at an incredible speed, and disappeared over the horizon within a couple of seconds. There were no trails behind it, as one would expect shooting star or fireball to have. Instead the light remained constant as it skimmed across the sky. Its flight path was not straight, as it glided quickly across the sky, but rather it made a few slight curving maneuvers, moving like a hockey puck over uneven ice. The whole incident was quickly over. There was no sound accompanying the object. I felt an overwhelming sense of “Wow” after seeing it.  Over the years I’ve seen comets, shooting stars, fireballs, falling space debris as well as all matter of aircraft. This moved like nothing I had ever seen before in my life at a speed that was incomprehensible.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

Red Ball moving slowly across Bremerton...;2007-10-15 19:45:00;About 5-7 min.;Red Ball moving slowly across Bremerton... I am wondering if anyone else saw the red ball around 7:45PM tonight.  I live in downtown Bremerton by the 7-11.  I went outside to get a cigarette out of my friends car.  I looked up and I saw this red ball traveling very slowing from south to north.  It did not make any noise and moved very slowing sometimes stopping briefly.  At one moment my friend commented that it looked like a giant key. Also it would sometimes would fade in and out but it was definately not like the lights on an airplane.  It could have possibly been a helicopter but it made no noise at all.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

We stared a few moments and began walking again. I stopped to talk with the safety guy and we watched it for at least 10 min. Others noticed us and began watching. You could see the air traffic from Sea-Tac well below the light. Once back on the aircraft carrier some of the Stennis officers and sailors had noticed it also, a couple of men maybe piolets because of their clothing said theres no way thats a hovering chopper.I figure at about 7:40 pm it flickerd twice and was gone, just blinked out.

Two bright lights over Bremerton - Port Orchard.;2013-03-20 21:10:00;5 minutes;Two bright lights over Bremerton - Port Orchard my husband and I were closing the gate of the property we live on and taking the trash to the bin - I looked across the sky in the South East direction, which would be over in Bremerton - Port Orchard. I saw two very bright orange lights in the sky, they were not stars as they were moving - at first I thought they were planes but both my husband and I decided against that, they didn't have pulsing lights, they were stationary neither moving away from us or toward us.  The lights seemed parallel to each other, then one light seemed to move up higher than the other but keeping a similar distance apart - then the lower light seemed to get brighter then started to dim, as the light became less bright it moved at a faster speed, the moving further away to the east then disappeared.  The other light remained for a while longer then it too moved upwards all the while it's light also became less bright, I could just make out an orange dot then it vanished completely! -  I waited around for a while longer but the lights did not return.  I did see a plane, but these move at a faster pace so you can tell if they are planes flying in or out.  Judging by the clouds these lights were high up - they could have been helicopters I suppose but not sure they were very stationary.  Would be great if anyone else noticed these lights in Bremerton or Port Orchard.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
Red/orange lights over Kitsap County.;2013-07-04 23:30:00;10 minutes;Red/orange lights over Kitsap County The neighbors behind my house were lighting off fireworks and two red-orange lights caught my eye.  They were several miles away and I thought might be airplanes but they were very close together.  Thought they might be helicopters but they veered towards and away from each other.  There's no way (at least I'd hope not) that pilots would fly in such a pattern.  After about a minute, one headed north and the other towards me and they both disappeared. About another minute later, 2 more appeared at about the same place I saw the first ones.  Same red/orange color and similar flight pattern, however, they both headed northward (away from me) and disappeared at the same time. It might have been about 5 minutes after that I saw another one.  It traveled the same pattern but after about 30 seconds it went upward and disappeared. The night had scattered clouds but where I saw these things I also saw clear sky and stars. I grew up in Southern California near an Air Force Base and I am fairly confident in my ability to identify air craft and lights on air craft.  What I saw tonight was one solid light with no visible craft/attachments.  No discernable lights on wings or different colors. They were too low to be satellites.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

Finally three of them were left and they were almost in a straight line across from each other, then one faded away and then the others.  I just happened to see them when I took my dogs outside.  There were no engine sounds like an airplane, they didn't have any sound.

Red glowing light flashing white and out maneuvering any known aircraft;2015-09-09 22:00:00;20 minutes;Red glowing light flashing white and out maneuvering any known aircraft On the evening of September 9th 2015 my husband and I witnessed what we both at first believed to be an airplane while outside having a cigarette on our deck. We saw a red glowing circular light (not blinking)and we assumed it to be an airplane in a holding pattern as we usually can see that type of air traffic frequently out of Sea-Tac.  The light was red & not changing but what caught our immediate attention was that it would flash a white light three times then turned back to glowing red every so often.  It came in from the east.  After several minutes trying to figure out what it might be it came to a dead stop in the sky, flashed white 3 times again then proceeded to do a straight drop decent behind the trees per our view of the horizon.  We were astonished and stayed to see if it would come back in to view and after a few minutes it came back in to our view and began moving sided to side (right/left & left/right) back & forth and flashing white every so ofte! n. It seemed to be searching for something and I witnessed several smaller glowing objects flying out & dropping down from the craft. This was watched by both of us for at least 20minutes if not longer. It was in the path of airplane traffic that night & must have come up on radar somewhere. We figured it was out towards Manchester or Blake Island/over the Puget Sound or in that general area. We watched it descend out of view again and waited another 5-10min before going back inside. This morning, today being 9-11-15 I woke up with pain in my back and have a welt with a circular scoop mark on my back and a big scratch there is no way I could have done to myself. I'm not sure if they are related but I believe I've been having these types of encounters all my life. My mother & sister have reported to this agency before over a major happening back in 2001 & Robert Fairfax came to interview them however my mom was too afraid to face it at the time as that wasn't her 1st encount! er. I'm hoping to get some help for our family to try & unders! tand all of this! Thanks for reading & hope we weren't the only ones who saw this :-);47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
