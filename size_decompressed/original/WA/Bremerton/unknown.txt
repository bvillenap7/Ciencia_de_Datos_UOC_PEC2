At about 7:24 PM Pacific Standard time, we observed a bright white flash on the moon in the upper/mid Mare Serenitatis region, west of Crater Posidonus. Perceived as larger than how Venus appears. It was a quick flash  like white, intense lightning. I'm not sure how to report degrees of arc but if the face we see is 90, and we start from the east then the flash occurred about 225 arc seconds to the west. This was observed by the naked eye, with clear skies between us and the moon.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073

Long strip of flashing red lights in a row  climbing up  through the clouds.;2007-04-01 03:30:00;1 minute;Long strip of flashing red lights in a row  climbing up  through the clouds. I was on my way to work and was turn at the intersection when these red lights caught my   attention  to the right of my car when I was making the turn to the left. It was very large with red lights blinking in a straight line, but all I could see was the back end of the object because it was still very dark out and very cloudy and it was there for only a few second before it disappeared in the clouds .It was very quick and I didn't hear anything .;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
It was white and  moving around, back and fourth;2012-05-25 12:40:00;10 minutes;It was white and  moving around, back and fourth I saw to the North a white ball in the sky, with a tail moving around in the air back and forth for about 10 minutes before disappearing.  I would like an investigator to investigate the area in general in regards to UFO'sightints.  Regardless of whether I had a witness to seeing the UFO or not, which was definetly visible, giving the weather was sunny outside.

Heard a very loud craft noise hovering outside my bedroom window in the backyard that took off seconds later.;2012-11-11 04:40:00;10-20 seconds;Heard a very loud craft noise hovering outside my bedroom window in the backyard that took off seconds later. I was awakened this morning to a very loud machine type noise at approximately 4:40 am coming from the other side of our bedroom wall in the back yard.   It remained there for approximately 10-20 seconds and then flew away very quickly but I could still here it in the distance.  It was pretty far in a matter of seconds but then sounded like it started to head back our direction as the sound got a little closer again but still very distant.   Then it was completely gone.  Unfortunately I did not look out as I was too afraid of what I might see or that they (whoever) might see me.;47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
White and red strobing lights gliding silently, changing directions, then appearing as three distinct solid white lights in a row.;2013-05-04 02:45:00;20-30 minutes;White and red strobing lights gliding silently, changing directions, then appearing as three distinct solid white lights in a row. As I was driving an early AM paper route this morning, I noticed in the Eastern sky a large, bright silver-white light strobing in an alternating pattern with a single red light.  The red light, oriented to the South of the craft, would flash first, followed about Â¼ second later by the white light.  The red light was flashing about once per second.  The craft at first was moving in a Northward direction, then after a few minutes, it began to move southward. I noted that there was no sound, and the craft seemed very low in the sky, maybe 3,000- 5,000 ft.   I am not a good judge of altitude, but it occurred to me that had it been a plane, it would have been making a landing approach to be that low or close.  Also, had it been a helicopter, I would most definitely have heard the chopping propeller sound since it was so close.  There was never any jet or chopper noise, and I had my window rolled down completely in the vehicle. As I proceeded southward along my route, moving from the Keyport region, into Brownsville/Illahee, I was able to periodically track the motion of the object at certain points where the view to the East allowed.  It continued gliding slowly in both directions (North for a few minutes, then South, always remaining to my East out over the Puget Sound.)  At one point during the sighting, I noticed that it appeared to have changed orientation and I could see three solid bright white/silver lights in a line, (maybe facing toward me, rather than parallel to me.)  I thought that it might be a triangular shape and that the three lights denoted the tips.  The middle light seemed to be a little brighter or larger, maybe due to being closer from my perspective.   The entire sighting took place over a period of 20-30 minutes between about 2:45 AM and 3:15 AM. I eventually lost my line of sight due to natural obstructions (a heavily wooded area.);47.5924902439025;-122.657557317073
