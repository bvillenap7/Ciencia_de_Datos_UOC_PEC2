White saucer shaped craft, with black tinted windows, and with no noise.;2016-08-08 01:30:00;1 minute;White saucer shaped craft, with black tinted windows, and with no noise. 	On August 08, 2016, at 1:30 am, I witnessed a white saucer shaped craft, with a continuous row of square black windows that ran the circumference of the craft.  At the closest point of my viewing field the vehicle, was only about 150 yards of my location, and 200-250 feet above ground, clearing a large group of trees and a cell phone tower to my West.   I would put this craft as being 70-90 feet across.  The craft approached my position with a moderate rate of speed, from the WNW, to within 150 yards of my location.  At that point, it turned abruptly South and flew away at a high rate speed over a factory and across the Columbia River into Oregon.   During this entire encounter there was no sound whatsoever from the craft or from the atmosphere being disturbed by its arrival or departure. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and eloquent.  However, his telephone now does not accepte calls, which is a warning sign as to the authenticity of the original report, we believe.  PD));46.1478000000001;-122.9711
