Shiny metal egg over Trojan Nuclear Plant in Oregon.;2007-07-15 13:30:00;5 Minutes;Shiny metal egg over Trojan Nuclear Plant in Oregon. I was driving from Longview, WA to Kalama WA, which is a 15 minute drive. I looked over across the Columbia river to the old Trojan Nuclear power plant which has been decomission and is being torn down. Hovering above it probably about 1000 feet was a shiny metal egg shaper thing. I tried to watch it as long as i could but I was on Interstate 5 and the traffic was heavy. I watched it until some trees got in my way and when I came out the other side of the trees it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
