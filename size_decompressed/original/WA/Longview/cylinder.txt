Two cylinder shaped objects that flew parallel in the sky.;2014-12-11 18:30:00;10 seconds;Two cylinder-shaped objects that flew parallel in the sky. The power went out in our neighborhood around 4:00 p.m.  My fiance and I decided to leave our house to go get some candles and other things we would need for the outage.  We stepped outside and I looked to the sky and thought to myself how brilliant the stars looked.  Immediately, I noticed two long cylinder-shaped objects in the sky.  I pointed them out to my fiance and he gasped.  We watched the objects for about 10 seconds. They were parallel to each other and moving in a NE direction.  They were brightly lit and white almost silverish in color and identical.  Moving at high speeds, they suddenly began to criss-cross with each other.  Kind of zig zagging and began to lower altitude until they vanished behind some pollution clouds from the nearby factory. This was unlike anything I ever witnessed in my entire life.  My fiance saw it as well and we were both amazed.  There is no possible way they could have been known human crafts. Not a shooting star, meteor or comet.  Not weather balloons, or commonly human made objects.  I am positive that they were intelligently maneuvered.  There is no doubt in my mind that I saw something truly magnificent tonight.;46.1478000000001;-122.9711
Object that looked like a string of pearls in the sky.;2021-05-15 22:36:00;5 minutes;Object that looked like a string of pearls in the sky. What was seen at first was a single constant light moving towards the north sky from a southern position without sound and next to it a bright light came on next to it asmif it were another craft of some sort, and then a few seconds later the light went out, and the object continued north until out of sight. Then a few minutes later a long craft was seen moving from our west to northeast.  This craft looked like a string of pearls in a row. The craft was very long and looked big as if it were in the upper atmosphere. It moved at the pace of a satellite in orbit until it was out of sight in the same direction as the other object. I took video of the object although the video is not very clear unfortunately. I will still be happy to share it.;46.1478000000001;-122.9711
