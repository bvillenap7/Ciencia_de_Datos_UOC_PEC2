Entire sky lit up with two seperate flashes near Longview Washington.;2004-01-01 17:38:00;30 seconds;Entire sky lit up with two seperate flashes near Longview Washington. It was very snowy roads and foggy in the area. We were driving south on Interstate 5 when the entire sky lit up with a flash of light that I thought was blue, and my step-daughter thought was green. I was starting to use the phone but was so startled by the light I put it down immediately. The flash only lasted about a half of a second. About thirty seconds later, the sky lit up again with a flash the same duration and the same color. We could see nothing in the sky between the flashes or after the last one.;46.1478000000001;-122.9711
