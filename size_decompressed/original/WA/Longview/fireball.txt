Fireball streaks slowly across northern sky.;2002-11-29 06:15:00;3 minutes;Fireball streaks slowly across northern sky. A long fireball was streaking slowly across the northern sky until it disappeared behind the hills.  It was too fast to have been an aircraft and too slow to have been a comet.  It was unlike anything we have ever seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness is alluding to the re-entry event of space debris on 28NO02.   However,  please see second report for this date from Enumclaw, WA.  PD));46.1478000000001;-122.9711
3 Red lights that looked like fireballs fly through the sky in Longview, WA;2011-07-03 22:00:00;4 mins;3 Red lights that looked like fireballs fly through the sky in Longview, WA MY SON AND I WERE LYING DOWN ACCROSS THE STREET FROM OUR HOUSE IN THE SCHOOL FEILD WATCHING FIREWORKS WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE SAYS TO ME WOW MOM LOOK AT THOES!, WHAT ARE THEY?   AT FIRST WHEN I SEEN THEM I THOUGHT IT WAS PART OF A FIREWORK FALLING, BUT WHEN I REALIZED IT WASNT FADING OUT WE BOTH WERE SPEACHLESSâ€¦ WE STOOD UP WATCHING THESE 3 BRIGHT RED COLORED SOUNDLESS OBJECTS FLY FAIRLY LOW FOR AN AIRPLANE I THOUGHT. IT GOT BRIGHTER AS IT CAME TOWARDS US,  THEN SLOWLY TURNED OFF AND STARTED TO FADE AWAY,  WE KEPT OUR EYES ON THEM UNTIL THEY DISSAPEARED OUT OF SIGHT.   AFTER THAT WE CONTINED TO LAY DOWN WATCHING FOR FIREWORKS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE HAD JUST SEEN?   WE THOUGHT IT WAS A METEOR OR SOMETHING, UNTIL WE STARTED LOOKING UP ON THE INTERNET AND DECIDED THAT WASNT WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AT ALL.  THATS WHEN WE FOUND A LINK TO THIS SIGHT AND I COULDNT BELIEVE HOW EXACT THE DESCRIPTION WAS THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAD SAW JUST LIKE WHAT WE HAD SEEN!;46.1478000000001;-122.9711

Was pacing an Amtrak train and looked to make sure I was still pacing the train when I saw a bright, low object over the Columbia River that looked to break into two pieces then dissapear.  There was no trail like a meteor would leave.  Seemed too low and too fast to be a plane.   I posted to facebook right away to see if anyone else saw it cause it was just to weird.;46.1478000000001;-122.9711

Af;2014-01-27 17:35:00;2-3 minutes;Driving home just after sundown I drove around a corner to see a number of lights (9-12), red-orange in color, ascending to the sky.  After about 15 seconds I realized I was almost stopped in the road and drove to a parking lot maybe a quarter mile up the road, exited my vehicle and took a picture and short video.  Only being a few blocks from home in jumped back in my truck and raced home to show my wife.  When we went outside, the ascending lights were no longer there, only three white lights in the shape of a triangle traveling away from us.  I never heard a sound, and it seemed the ascending objects were moving very slow like a ballon, but in the 90 seconds it took my to drive home and grab my wife, the objects were no longer many, but one.;46.1478000000001;-122.9711
