Glowing lantern or drone? passes overhead during 4th of July firework displays in Longview, WA..;2015-07-04 22:00:00;10 minutes;Glowing lantern or drone? passes overhead during 4th of July firework displays in Longview, WA.. On July 4th of 2015, my husband and I were sitting on our back porch watching fireworks in the Longview area.  Our property sits up on a hill about 600 ft. above sea level, so it is easy to see many of the fireworks displays.   While we were watching the large fireworks displays on our porch, both of us noticed what we first thought was a large burning ember from one of the commercial fireworks display, drifting from west to east about 200 ft. above our home.  We both were concerned, as the weather had been very hot and dry, and our home sits on 2 acres about half of which is wooded.   I ran to get the binoculars and had the chance to see what looked like a glowing silently moving lantern.  I gave the binoculars to my husband, and he could not identify what it was.   I suggested it might be a drone.  But, there was no sound and it seemed to be glowing like a candle flame turning slightly as if to monitor it continued on eastward over our hill until out of sight.  Very strange, indeed.;46.1478000000001;-122.9711
