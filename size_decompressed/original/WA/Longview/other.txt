Then slowly moved off to the east out of sight from my window.  No sounds heard. Was asleep in townhouse second floor bedroom with blinds open.  Awoke facing  window saw dark grey object in the air not moving (maybe 50> feet up...difficult to tell).  Object or objects appeared hexagonal-shaped.  Could have been 5-6  objects clustered into one unit or just one object.  May have had something hanging down from it (rope-like) but I was looking through open blinds that, of course, have cords that run vertically connecting them so hard to tell.  Sat up to look more closely, and object slowly moved past upper left corner of window out of sight.  Today I heard about comets or space debris seen in sky here around 2115  last night.  No one in paper reported this non-glowing dark object appearing at around 0215 this AM.                                                                  I am 45 yrs old, Registered Nurse, female, living in condo overlooking golf course.  Christian , and am not looking for little green men and space ships just don't know the ide! ntity of what I saw out there.;46.1478000000001;-122.9711
Amber glowing orb appeared in night sky of Longview, WA, witnessed by many during Go 4th Celebration.;2012-07-04 22:30:00;approx. 5 minutes;Amber glowing orb appeared in night sky of Longview, WA, witnessed by many during Go 4th Celebration. During our city fireworks display, a amber glowing orb appeared over tree tops and seemed to float, eventually becoming smaller as if it had gone higher.  I was with my adult children, sitting in a group of thousands of people and you could see people in the crowd noticing and pointing to the object.  Initially, is resembled a firework fall out but it never dimmed like a burning object would of.  About an hour later, at my home 3 blocks from park where first sighting took place, I was watching neighborhood fireworks and suddenly the same type of glowing orb appeared in the sky.  Once again, it just floated as if it was riding an air current.  It floated around this area for about 15 mins until it got high enough or far enough that it looked smaller. It didn't flash or strobe.  The light was not bright it looked liked the amber glow of a flame.  There was not any noise associated with it.  The night sky was clear and star filled.  There was enou! gh pause between fireworks that the sky was not smoke filled.  When I spoke to my friend this morning, the first words out of her mouth was did you see the UFO?  Her family witnessed the same glowing orbs that I did, at the same times and saw an additional one around 01:00.;46.1478000000001;-122.9711
