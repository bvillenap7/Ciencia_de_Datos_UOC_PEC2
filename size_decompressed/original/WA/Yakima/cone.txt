Huge search light beam from 4 miles high in the sky illuminating a one mile diameter circle on the ground.;1974-10-07 19:50:00;40 minutes;Huge search light beam from 4 miles high in the sky illuminating a one mile diameter circle on the ground. Passenger asked pilot what was a light in the sky overhead. Flight was direct from Pendleton Oregon to Seatac at 10500' msl.  The light source seemed  to be sourced at about 20,000' msl like a huge landing light or search light that illuminated the ground below about 1 mile in diameter.   The source was not visible as though a wing light were blocked by the fuselage, but the cone of light got brighter and ATC denied any traffic in the area.   At this point Pilot elected to change course and fly around rather than through the light beam area. Air to air queries to other pilots affirmed that the anomoly was visible to others that night.   At this point Deep Throat advised to can the chatter if you want to keep flying.   The beam was visible until descending into Seatac.   The next day a Seattle radio station reported that some hunters in Winthrop, WA, called in to report seeing the same light to the south and wondering what it was.
