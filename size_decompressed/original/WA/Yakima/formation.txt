3 very bright lights in a V formation, no sound and flying very slowly;2004-03-17 20:30:00;10 or 15 minutes;3 very bright lights in a V formation, no sound and flying very slowly On March 17, 2004, around 8:30pm, I was taking my daughter to the hospital because she was having a flare up of her Crohn's Disease. When she was going around to the passenger side of the car she saw 3 bright lights to the north of us and said mom, what is that? I came out and looked, and saw 2 very bright white lights and one smaller one in kind of a triangular formation, but closer than any planes I've ever seen. They didn't seem to be moving and looked fairly close to the ground. I ran in and got my daughters' digital camera, and told my son to come out and look at them too. When I came back, they were still in the same spot. She took a picture & they started moving toward us, so she took another picture. They turned SSE of us, moving toward Ahtanum Ridge slowly. We could see lights flashing, so at first I thought it might be planes, but they didn't make a sound. We watched them go south over the ridge towards Wapato, then they were gone. My daughter called the newspaper the next morning to see if anyone else had reported it & they said no. She also called the FAA tower at the airport to see if they saw them, but the guy she talked to said none of them were on duty the night before. He also jokingly asked someone in the room with him if he could tell her it was ufos, and they said No. I found this site tonight because I was still thinking about what we saw, and when i read the reports from Ellensburg & Yakima on the same date, i had to file my report too.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Eight bright silent pulsating UFOs move over Yakima WA neighborhood and hover for 10  minutes then disappear.;2011-12-23 00:30:00;ten minutes;Eight bright silent pulsating UFOs move over Yakima WA neighborhood and hover for 10  minutes then disappear. UFO sighting in Yakima, WA on Dec 23 2011 at 12:30am.  My partner was letting the dogs out into the backyard and as he exited the house he right away noticed lights in the sky moving from NW to SE.  He took an image with his cell phone of the five objects in a formation.  He then looked up and saw 2 more objects move in fast (from the NW) to join the first five.  He re-entered the house to alert me to come out and look.  We went out the front door and to the front yard where we looked to the SW and saw the objects hovering in formation low in the sky.   The 6th and 7th object were hovering to the low right of the first five.  Some of the first five objects (or lights on one object) now started fading/ disappearing.  An 8th object came (from the NW) and slowly moved along the area where the others were now fading/ disappearing.  Then it too disappeared.  I took one 30 second cell phone video and my partner took 3 of them.  One of his shows the 7 objects and o! ne of his shows the final 8th object.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Looked to the SW watched a triangle of 3 flashing lights that held postion for 30 minutes. then proceeded slowly to SW.;2012-08-06 22:00:00;30 minutes;Looked to the SW watched a triangle of 3 flashing lights that held postion for 30 minutes. then proceeded slowly to SW. I watched 3 bright lights in the sky to the SW of Yakima, Washington for over 30 minutes. I am a private pilot and am used to seeing the stars and aircraft in the sky. The objects did changed color similair to an aircraft light system. but not quite the same. I saw what to my eye were green, red, white, and orange flashing lights. I did see an aircraft moving near the upper most light. It appeared to have a standard red nav lighting.Its postion would have put it north of the top light and it moved back and forth and appeared to be circling.  I did watch for about 20 minutes thru binoculars.  I called my 2 college age children and after some good natured ribbing we drove to a high point and watched as the lights disappeared to the SW. When I say disappear I mean they got dimmer and appeared to drop slightly on the horizon but not below, until we could no longer see them. They still maintained the triangle shape.  They appeared to be several miles apart and at differant altitudes. I do know the military was scheduled to fly Chinook helicopter night flights but those would have been in the opposite direction to these lights 35 miles to the SE. The gentleman on the phone asked in relation to the stars I could see how large where these lights. I would say 3-4 times brighter and larger than the other star we could see.Visiblity was good with no cloud cover or moon. Tempature was 81 degrees.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
