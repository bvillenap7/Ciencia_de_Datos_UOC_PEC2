Triangle shaped object seen over Yakima valley traveling from west to east, it changed its path of travel three times.;2003-08-10 18:55:00;10 to 15 seconds;Triangle shaped object seen over Yakima valley traveling from west to east, it changed its path of travel three times. I was sitting out at my patio table enjoying a Sunday evening and caught a glimpse of a very fast moving object out of the corner of my eye.  I took a second look to make sure that what I was looking at wasn't a reflection.  I was startled and excited at what I saw.  The object was moving from West to East across the Yakima valley.  The object traveled very quickly and changed its trajectory three separate times.  The shape of the object was a triangle.  It appeared to be solid in shape, it was about the size of a star at night and was white in color, and did not have a vapor trail. I watched it for as long as it stayed visible, which was about ten to fifeteen seconds.  The object went behind cloud cover and that was the last I saw of this object.  This was my first sighting of a UFO and I feel very fortunate to have seen one.  My wife was outside with me during my sighting, but unfortunately was unable to see the object. I think she was looking just a little below the object. I am a male in my 30's and this is my first UFO sighting.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
St. Paddy's Day UFOs over Yakima, Washington;2004-03-17 20:28:00;5 minutes;St. Paddy's Day UFOs over Yakima, Washington I first saw them while sitting in the car with my mother in the driveway. I happened to glance NW of my position and pointed at three large, bright lights in the sky. They seemed to be motionless, and almost looked like airplanes, but were too close together and in a triangular shape. My mom ran inside the house to get my digital camera while I stared at them to see if they were moving, but they appeared to be either at a stand-still or moving directly towards me. My brother came outside and looked at them and said they were probably airplanes, but I mentioned that they made absolutely no sound at all, and were close enough that they should have been rather noisy. He shrugged, watched for a second and walked back inside. I took four pictures of the lights, but only 3 showed anything other than colored pixels. After the first flash of the camera, the objects began to move slowly southward, toward Ahtanum Ridge. There was a large, distinctly triangular object in front, moving extremely slowly, and a smaller craft following closely behind it, blinking red, white and blue. If it had made noise, or moved in a different direction, it could have easily been an airplane. But it didn't, and as far as I'm concerned, it wasn't. There was a third one, the same size as the one in the front, following a little farther behind the smaller craft in the center. They were all traveling exactly the same speed, which was also why I decided they weren't airplanes. When you live in the same place since you were born, you know the air traffic and where it moves. Airplanes don't fly over Ahtanum ridge unless there's an emergency or touch-and-go training. Another reason I don't believe they were airplanes is because of their speed. All the planes I see, flying that closely (I couldn't give an accurate estimate as to the distance between myself and the three craft.) would make at least a tiny bit of noise. Considering the size of the outer two objects, unless they were stealth bombers, they would make quite a bit of noise. The smaller one, if it hadn't have been following the others, I would have easily dismissed it as an airplane at a much farther distance. Then they turned left at a slight curve and vanished over the ridge, heading towards Wapato, Washington. Mom and I got back into the car and headed north, and upon reaching the stop sign at a T-intersection, heard a car alarm sounding, coming from the left towards the fire station. All of the lights at the fire station were on, as well. The only reason the car alarm took us by surprise is because we live in the boonies and I had no idea anyone out here even had a car alarm. If they did, we've never heard it before and we've lived here for 18 years.  The reason I'm not attaching the pictures I took is because my mother sent them already in a previous report. She didn't know I had filled one out the night it happened, so she sent her own description of the events.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Trianglular craft spotted over Yakima.;2005-06-08 23:30:00;2 Seconds;Trianglular craft spotted over Yakima. Craft silently sped from the west over my house. Craft was a triangle and had a reflective white light around the edges. The light was similar to the color of the stars in the sky, did not seem to be navigational in purpose. Extremely fast and did not trail any smoke or contrails. Aurora? Seemed to be at least at ten thousand feet but not more that about 30 thousand. Trying to guess at the size is tough, but I would say bigger than our B-1 but not as large as a football field.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375

The object made no noise.  I had previously observed an object with the same description it my have been the same a few weeks before this event. 1st I saw 3 passenger jets one in the south one, in approx. Above my location and the 3rd north the were traveling diagonal from south east to north west towards seattle, and all of a suuden a triangular object, very huge, flew in just 3-4 secs from the north west to south east location. This distance took the jets 3-4 mins rather then secs to cover that distanc ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

I was going south down the Freeway by the Mill in Yakima Washington,on March 16th 2007 about 1:30 pm, when I first noticed the 2 objects in the air,it was going up and down in the air about(tree line height) and I, my Husband and are 3 children,and other driver's on freeway noticed the crafts watching them, We kept watching them while we we're driving down the freeway, doing 60 mph and they were keeping up pace with us going up and down above the house's and tree's and doing flips & turns, it was very low towards the house's, when it did flips to the side it was very thin almost disappearing it looked like it was about 12-15 feet long and 5 feet wide, they were a gray color, triangle shape they had no propellers or visible engine ,We watched it for about 3 minutes before it disappeared.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Large, low flying triangle shaped aircraft over night skies in Yakima, WA;2008-03-27 23:40:00;10-15 min;Large, low flying triangle shaped aircraft over night skies in Yakima, WA. Could well be an experimental aircraft of some kind. This one puzzles me due to the size, low altitude, and the fact that another aircraft (plane/helicopter?) joined it to the southeast (toward Union Gap), where it appeared to stall or hover for a short while (+/- 5 min). Shorty thereafter, it was out of view (by the time I scaled my roof-top).  I was letting the dog in around 11:40 PM when I spotted a large (originally thought to be an) aircraft flying directly over Yakima, WA in a S-SE fashion. It was way off any normal flight paths known or typically observed in the area. Not to mention the low altitude, estimated at 4,000-6,000 feet! The craft was extremely loud which obviously points to a plane of some sort. However, when it was directly above my neighborhood (central portion of the city), a strange triangle shape was clearly observed, and the lights were plentiful. Looked like a 747 (on steroids) in the shape of a triangle with blinking lights (white) all over the craft.  Was just curious if you received any other reports from the area on this date (evening of 3/27/08)? And if so, what the heck was this Peter? I wasn't under the impression that Central WA is much of a test area for military aircraft.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Triangular aircraft seen from Divide Ridge;2009-07-18 20:00:00;5 min;Triangular aircraft seen from Divide Ridge A friend and I were camped at the far western end of Divide Ridge. (Western end of NFR 1020.) 46° 33' 25.95 N 121° 11' 47.53 W   This is the former site of a fire lookout tower and has an unobstructed view facing west.   Elevation of the site is about 6500 feet. This is accessible by 4 wheel drive or ATV from Tampico Washington about twenty miles to the east. (Yakima is 30 miles to the east)   We had seen occasional air traffic throught the day, the latest being a C-17 overflying the area from west to east at approximately 1900. I was  preparing dinner around when my friend asked me to identify an “airplane” he was watching.  He pointed out a dark colored triangular flying wing with a span of about 25 feet and a depth of around 6 feet.  When it was pointed out to me it was coming toward us from the west (traveling west to east)  at more or less our altitude. It approached our position eventually overflying us at an altitude of about 500 feet AGL and made a rather leisurely turn to the north and continued along the ridge line eventually moving out of sight in the general direction of Rimrock lake which we could just barley see about ten miles to our north.  Through the whole encounter its speed remained quite low.  I estimate it was moving about 50mph.   My impression was of more or less highway speed.  If I'm correct this is most likely too slow for aerodynamic lift. We passed the night uneventfully and returned home the next day. I at first assumed this was an unmanned aircraft but it had no marking or visible control surfaces. When it turned it did not visibly bank.  Even from directly underneath it was completely silent and its surface showed no visible details of any kind, no jet exhaust, no intakes, no landing gear doors.  When it was approaching I got a decent look at it through binoculars and saw no obvious intakes anywhere. In my opinion it exceeds the state of the art, and I have no idea what would posses anyone to operate such a craft in that time and place unless they are trying to be seen.  thus my decision to report it here. Description: Dark colored triangle. L: about 15 feet W: about 25 feet H: about 6 feet Speed about 50mph  Thicker at the front than at the back (airfoil shaped) No marking or visible means of propulsion. No sound. No sign of control surfaces.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375

Four different lights, shining like if they were wildfire, appeared soundless, somewhat, over Yakima City (Which was Northeast from my location).  The lights where all in a diagonal line pointing south.  I would say that in about 20 seconds of viewing the lights.  The third light down slowly dimmed, but then to appear first of the line.   All of the lights seemed to shift except for one, the brightest light of the four. While the lights where shifting, I grabbed my binoculars, mine are not for night vision, and for a split second the object came into light.  I was able to see a triangular shape but without its point at the end. That appearance lasted six minutes, the next one was at 11:14 to 11:16 with the duration of two minutes.  The next one to follow was a 11:56 for about 15 seconds.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
While stopped at a traffic light my kids and I saw 3 strips of reddish orange lights in the sky not moving for about 30 seconds;2011-10-25 20:00:00;1 minute;While stopped at a traffic light my kids and I saw 3 strips of reddish orange lights in the sky not moving for about 30 seconds While waiting at a traffic light, I observed 3 strips of lights in the sky in a triangle shape.  Each light had 3 reddish orange lights on it.  It was approximately 100-150 feet in the sky and did not move for about 30 seconds.  There was no sound either.  It then slowly moved toward the southern sky.  My 2 kids and I witnessed it and also people stopped at the light were all staring at it too.  I have contacted the newspaper and local news and they will not return my calls.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Very fast and massive triangle shaped lights, non blinking, observed for 7-8 minutes;2020-10-14 06:00:00;7 minutes;Very fast and massive triangle shaped lights, non blinking, observed for 7-8 minutes Yakima Wa approximately 6:07am. Clear, no clouds still dark outside. I could see many stars. I was on my front porch and noticed an aircraft slowly ascending into the sky. Airport is close to my house. Just above this plane I saw what I that was another plane, but it wasn’t like anything I’ve ever seen before. Hundreds if not thousands of lights traveling very fast in unison. As I walked to the south of my yard I could see the other side of this craft. It was massive. All white non-blinking lights. Triangle shaped. Silent, and moving faster than any airplane I’ve ever seen. My iPhone could not detect a picture or video because of the lights on my property. I could clearly see this with the naked eyes. I watched this for more than 7 minutes straight. The pilot that was leaving from our airport had to have witnessed the same thing. As fast as this was moving, and how long I witnessed it, this craft had to be miles long. Since I couldn’t get pics or a video, I ! came inside and drew what I saw and everything I could remember about this event. I took a pic of my drawing and then texted it to myself so there would be a time stamp and date on my report. I went on Yakima scan to see if anything was reported and I saw nothing. I posted a short note saying, “did anyone else see the lights above the airport from the West heading East”? I didn’t want to give a full description because I wanted to be able to confirm the details I saw without leading others . I know what I saw and witnessed. I’d like to know if anyone else has reported this as well. I decided not to include the picture and details I drew out because only my husband was notified of what I saw, and if I see that there’s other reports, it will prove my drawing was correct. Please feel free to contact me. Please!!;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
