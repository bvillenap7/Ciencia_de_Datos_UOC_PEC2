Silver tear drop craft lost time, confusion;2012-04-26 03:00:00;30 seconds;Silver tear drop craft lost time, confusion   My coworker and I had just gotten off our graveyard shift at a local casino.  We carpool because my car broke down a couple days ago.  We don’t know each other every well but we experienced something amazing.  Our shift ended around 2:30 am and both of us living in a suburb of Yakima it took us about 30 minutes to drive home. 20 or so minutes into our drive my friend’s car mysteriously shut off. Being two women and it being dark and late we got nervous.  That’s when we heard it.  It was quiet at first a little buzzing noise and I thought I was just hearing things.  But when my friend pointed it out as well I knew it wasn’t just me.   We got out of the car and walked around trying to see where the noise was coming from.  Then in the sky we spotted two teardrop shaped figures, they were silver and moving very quickly.  It was odd as if they were jumping from one place into the other but instantaneously. It freaked us out. For a moment we both felt as if we had left o! ur bodies and were looking down and watching the scene unfold from above.  Then black!  And when we awoke we found ourselves in the car and it was running again.  Only now it was 6:00 am. Neither my friend nor I can account for the lost time and is as if it was all a very really dream.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
