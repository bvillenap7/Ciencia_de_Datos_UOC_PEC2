Two round orbs of light shifting in area;2011-04-23 23:27:00;38 minutes;Two round orbs of light shifting in area Tonight I saw three orb of light turn into one.  This light that is now known to me, would decrease and increase in brightness.  After five minutes the light dimmed, but was still visible, and a second orb appeared next to the original light.   The pair would decrease, increase brightness and would move further or closer to each other.  The objects would change direction, or formation.  There was no noise to the craft but I did hear helicopter not too far away.   When I used my binoculars I did see something emitting the light.   I donâ€™t know what it was but I saw something.  At 00:05, the two lights turned into one and dimmed.  Then I heard the sounds of helicopters about 30 seconds later.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375

The color was mostly white and orange this appeared right before a very fast large orange object flashed over yakima headed in the Mt. Adams direction I have seen the diamound shape craft before around Mt. Adams they are impressive to witness.   I myself in the last 3 years have seen at least 25 good UFO sightings in and around Yakima;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
