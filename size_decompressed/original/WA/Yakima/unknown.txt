mysterious 3 sets of 3 lights saw no clue what is was then a big flash pls read;2003-09-12 20:50:00;5-10 sec;mysterious 3 sets of 3 lights saw no clue what is was then a big flash pls read Well im consider myself a computer gamer and was taking a break from a long brake i was getting a drink of water and looked out the window but first i dont really consider myself a ufo biliver until now any ways i was looking out my window inwhich i live south of the airport and i am very good at notify all types of aircraft this was about a 850 pm pt i saw just above some trees three lights that were kind of  in a trianlge formation but they turned on but it was like they were doing a touch and go but when they got close to the runway they tured on and then about when they got about 500 ft they turned off but that lasted about 3 seconds then again the same thing happend and but this time there was a big glow like at night when there is a county fair the whole sky was lit up around it then it did the same thing as the other and went off and then a 3rd one came also like a trianlge with 1 head light 1 on the left and one on the right. as the first one i saw i figurd it was  a big cargo plane but then i saw the 2nd with the big light and the 3rd one like the first one and the lights on them were big not like the lights on a normal plane/jet they were big. so i thought to myself what the heck planes dont have their lights off and turn then on when they get close to the airport and turn them off again and fly in that close in formation and they were completly silent no noise at all. and plus they were about once the lights on one went off about1/2 sec later the other came so i got scared being a 17 yr old male in which im usally not scared of much but this did me in so i tried calling my dad on cell no answere so i called my uncle and he got over to my house about in 5 min and then i was talkin to my mom about it then she told me to talk to my step dad and while i was talkin to him no more then 10 seconds into telling him i saw it again the first one was like the first one on the first one and same with the second one also had a big bright glow like the 1st time and there wasnt a 3rd one thi! s time they came about 2 seconds after each other and also no sound so then i aunt said go to the air port and go ask some people i live in a town about 80-100 thousand not a big airport but it was empty and we looked around me and my uncle, and we saw a security guard and he said it was probly a comercial jet or a military jet but i said it had the lights off but when it got low it had the lights on and then turned off agin and no red or green lights for left and right sides i told him it was silent and lights turned off well thats basically my story all 100% true i saw the 3 sets of 3 lights then i also saw 2 sets of 3 lights then i asked a friend on the internet and he said he saw some weird lights but didnt know what they were well i hope u belive this cus its 100% true i wasnt a beliver in ufo or anything like that well know im pretty sure it was a ufo or a top secret jet , i live my a training center where there is some top secret stuff well i hope u enjoy this story thanx o and it was pitch black over the airport and it was kinda i guess triangle shaped cus when i first saw it i thought the lights were kinda in a stealth bomber wing shaped area 1 in front and 2 on the wings i guess all i know of is i saw overall 15 lights and/or 5 craft or 15 1 per light;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Amazing moving BRIGHT white light;2004-07-01 22:15:00;1.5 minutes;Amazing moving BRIGHT white light Oddly enough we didn't think to look at the time, but we think it was between 10:15 and 10:30 PM.  We were camping above Clear Lake Washington.  121* 2' West 46* 35' North and viewed very high NNE.  (One of us -- not me, I'm a social worker -- is a geographer).  I spotted what I thought was a satellite very high where satellites belong, and moving south to north (no sound).  I told my partner to look and it flew along for a few seconds and then got INCREDIBLY bright... really white bright... we thought it had blown up, but stayed its course.  Then it became VERY dim... went on for a few mor seconds dim, and then vanished.  Both of us know how satellites behave, and this was NOT typical!!!;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375

I was justing wanting to know if anyone else might have seen this too.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
strange looking metalic objects  above yakima wa, spinning, then split up into different directions. big lower foating object vanished;2008-10-13 14:00:00;several minutes;strange looking metalic objects  above yakima wa, spinning, then split up into different directions. big lower foating object vanished Between the times of 3:40 pm to 4:20 pm, i was driving east on Nob Hill blvd in Yakima, Wa. that runs close by my home, i was stoped at an intersection that runs thru a college area, first one at the intersection in the inside lane, i leaned forward and looked up at these metalic looking objects, possibly party ballons. Im estimating the distance from my location to be around two to three miles. It looked like they came from the area of Wapato, Wa. It looked like they twsiting and wobbeling. They were scattered horizontally behind the light signals, it looked like they were above Union Gap, Wa. a suburb of Yakima city. It looked like there was four but i could be wrong, one or two of them were fading in and out like mirrors twisting. The light turned green and i proceeded east on Nob Hill blvd until i got to the college parking lot areas turned off in a north direction and stoped, got out of my vehicle, looked up and then noticed there were more above. I then got on to stewart, it is the first street that runs along side Nob Hill blvd on the north side it. I then went to my place which isnt very far from both those locations, after parking i got out then looked straight up, i then seen something that was much bigger and non metalic. It was odd shaped, looked sort of like a bunch of objects connected in a mass. I hurried into my place and found one of my sets of binoculars, by the time i got side and back to that same location, i couldnt find it, so im thinking it was lower then i thought i seen. There are trees in this area all over, its hard to say what it did. I then looked for the other ones that i had seen before, on my way home. I did observe two of these metalic ones, to the north. They were very far away, and it looked like they were changing there direction back to the east, towards Selah, Wa. which is another suburb of Yakima, Wa. After several minutes of trying to identify these, they just disappeared, it was like they had split up and went up higher in oposite directions. The lower bigger one that was non metalic, im not sure where that one went. I was wearing sun glasses, up until that last few minutes, then i couldnt see them anymore. It seemed like these sun glasses helped me to see them better then with the naked eye. This could have something to do with the light spectrum, it seemed like they were more shiny with the sun glasses on, when i took them off and looked i found it harder to respot them. This could be a hoax, even thou the lower jet stream usually goes in the opposite direction. One of these looked like it could have been a transparent weather ballon with an instrument hanging under it, another one almost looked like it was a parachute out of control. Three of these objects i cant explain, the big one disappeared, the other two that were metalic, they looked like smaller connected clusters making it look like one object. There could have been as much as six or seven objects, all doing different things. Its hard to say exactly what the sizes of these things where, i was able to spot them better, then a jet liner. I dont want to be contacted, i know you can find out who i am. Everything that i witnessed and reported about today is true and correct to the best of my ability.

Two Completely Silent Illuminations Slow and Low;2009-04-17 21:30:00;6-7 minutes;Two Completely Silent Illuminations Slow and Low On or about the date reported, my son and I were camping in our RV just off South Fork Ahtanum Ridge about 10 miles west of Tampico. While sitting outside by the fire and watching the sky I notice two lights moving from west to east. Initially I believed these were aircraft. As a few minutes passed and the objects came closer, my first thought was why no flashing marking lights? Dismissing the thought due to possible observation angles and possibly seeing only the front I waited until they came directly in front of us and then began to seriously consider something wasn’t right. The objects were far too close to each other and secondly didn’t make a sound. The ridge above us was around an elevation of 6500 ft, the objects were no more than 200 to 300 feet about the ridge line. (Less than 1000 feet above our location) Never at any angle was there a sound or any flash of strobes. The proximity of the two objects defies any commercial control and the speed was t! oo slow for any military AC to my knowledge. Everything about the sighting felt wrong and the senses continued to confirm it. The lights moved behind a tree line out of sight to the east.

Small object flying above jetliner;2010-08-08 18:00:00;3 min;Small object flying above jetliner As a jet airliner was passing over Yakima, WA, the sun had just set and the jet was reflecting the sunlight, I also noticed an object above the jetliner approx 2 inches (using my fingers to measure it) going in the same direction and the same speed as the jetliner.  It was much smaller than the jetliner, though I couldn't tell if it was a smaller jet or not, couldn't see wings on it. This lasted until both were not seen, approx 3 minutes.  I have never witnessed such an occurrence before while watching jetliners going over Yakima, WA heading toward SeaTac Airport.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Big bright star moving east over yakama indian reservation.;2011-02-10 05:55:00;1 minute;Big bright star moving east over yakama indian reservation. AT around 5:30 AM i wokeup and was starting to prepare my breakfast, i look out the window at around 5:55 AM and seen a big bright star moving east slowly. This lasted for about a minute, this was in the area above the yakama indian reservation. I could not tell what elevation it was at because it looks like a star. There was four to five flickers grouped together that lasted just a few seconds, it mite of been caused by the tip of a near by tree.  This would be the second time i have seen this here in the morning, the last time i went outside and watched where it disappeard, towards the low valley.  I dont believe this is the ISS because at that time it was traveling over the pacific ocean due south then turned east at the southern tip of south america.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
One of two hoverring vehicles suddenly left the other plane and spead across the night sky at a rapid rate and with no sound.;2011-12-17 22:00:00;90 sec;One of two hoverring vehicles suddenly left the other plane and spead across the night sky at a rapid rate and with no sound. Upon my return home from my girlfriends (under no influence of alcohol but pain medication Fentanyl ) I observed two plane type aircraft above an area known to be a military bombing base outside Yakima County. Suddenly, one of the two groups of lights came toward me but stayed high in the sky. It went so fast I felt very uneasy. I could see it moving but knew no plane goes that fast!  I had trouble adjusting to what I had just seen.I questioned the sighting but knew it was the real thing. There was no sound emanating from the vehicle. I looked back to where the two vehicles had been (hovering?) and only the one remained. So, I am sure I saw two of these UFOs. Although I suspect the remaining vehicle was a recognized U.S. Air Craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Far off object moving east to west in north yakima county between the yakima training center and the yakima river rec area.;2012-10-11 14:06:00;10;Far off object moving east to west in north yakima county between the yakima training center and the yakima river rec area.  Object i seen while working outside my place looked like white then fading in and out, then it seemed to do a reflective metalic with light mixed then went back to lite white.  I hurried to go into my place and get my camera, when i came back out to focus onto this it was gone.  I looked for this object for a few mins, couldnt find it.

Brilliant flash of light followed by a sonic boom;2016-07-28 01:00:00;2-3 seconds;Brilliant flash of light followed by a sonic boom Witnessed at around 1 am on July 28th, 2016, in Yakima, Washington.  As I work nights, I walk my German Shepherd on my nights off, and we usually go for a 5-mile walk. The night is clear, the stars are out and the moon is just rising. We were walking on a section of the road that curves up around a church and housing area and is higher than the surrounding area, which gives a good partial view of the surrounding city, of which in the day time also gives a great view of Mount Adams. My GSD stopped to sniff the air when there was a sudden and very bright flash of light to the South West of us. For a brief second, I could actually see Mount Adams in the distance. Then it was gone. Right after that, there was a very loud boom sound, not the sound of thunder, but more a sonic boom. I stood there for a couple of minutes watching the area where the light flash had happened but saw nothing else other than the stars in the sky. It was most certainly not heat lighting, of which I am very familiar with in that it happens a great deal in the area in the summer time, and I have spent a great many hours outside at night watching it flash along the surrounding mountains.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
