Disc seen in pic after dowloading pic to computer over military base;2009-05-24 15:00:00;seconds;Disc seen in pic after dowloading pic to computer over military base I was randomly taking pictures over a ridge in Yakima (actually just outside the city). I had just left my mom's to go back to Seattle. In this area, there is a Military Base as you ascend I-82 that seems completely invisible. There is never any activity going to and from the freeway exit to this base - you never see people, military aircraft or any vehicles. This area is highly suspicious for UFO sightings and is considered a hotspot. I was taking pictures of my boyfriend's white truck ahead of me (both of us drove separate to and from Yakima that weekend) and for some reason, I decided to take pictures as we went over this ridge, but just past the military sign. I was not thinking of anything in particular as I had my boyfriend's son with me in the car and we were just messing around with the camera. This UFO was not visible until after the picture was taken and I was viewing pictures later that evening. The first picture was taken from inside my car through the windshield and the 2nd was taken outside of my sunroof. This UFO is right above the military base area.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
In total five objects in flight four small possibly air plain size other one large seemed to hover with flashing lights;2012-08-21 23:00:00;30 -40 seconds;In total five objects in flight four small possibly air plain size other one large seemed to hover with flashing lights My husband and I sat down outside pointing south toward the sky I was out for my night cigarette , after about a minute of sitting out there and smoking and talking some lights in the sky had caught my attention granted in that direction is the Yakima airport I had reason to be scepticle of what I saw when I looked at the lights they appeared to disperse from one single point two flying southward into the horizon and competely went out of sight i diddnt see those two again and then two stayed in my general eyesight one flying east/se and then the other flew in a circle that went from south to west to east to north ending up to where it was to begin with and then followed the other one in the se pattern when they were flying together I realized that there in the further east there was a mass that had 6 lights total that we're flashing three were flashing  on the what looked the top and then 3 lights were flashing simotainiously towards the bottom ( this craf! t seemed to me to be sort of slanted in a vertical way) the lights were flashing a red and orange color and a blue and green it was blending in a patern like way I was in complete disbelief of what I was seeing I was compelled to keep looking because my mind was searching for a logical answer or explanation of some sort!  And  the two lights traveling in the eastern paterrn toward the mass seemed to disappear like they were  flying into it And then my husband exclaimed , &quot the lights are flashing around it now!&quot as I yelled out  &quot what the stuff are we seeing!&quot &quot what the stuff is that!&quot as the words were coming out of my mouth The lights seemed to shut off in a patern one by one all around it several times and it seemed to float slowly south to southeastern direction it seemed like it started off slow than suddenly it was gone like it was never there I'm really freaked out I have always believed in things like this but to actually see it has r! eally frightened me I'm still moling it over (note) the size h! ad to ha ve been at least the size of a city block,.
