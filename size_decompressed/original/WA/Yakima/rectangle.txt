spinning box;2001-11-15 16:30:00;3 minuetes;spinning box i was walking to work sometime in the late afternoon in the laate autumn of 2001, i looked up to take in the panorama of the sky and i saw whaat i first thought was a box kite floating in the sky but then i took a closer look and noticed there was no apparent string attached to this object, then i noticed the box was actually spinning in a very perfect spin, and spinning continueisly, in was also makeing a circular obit of rotation in the sky that appeared to be a few hundred feet or less, in this orbit was perfect , the  box was gray in its was standing on one corner, and as it spun , on side of the  box appeared to reflect light more the the other sides , wish were a grayish black color.  as i walked along a tall house obscured my view of the sky i was looking toward for a few seconds, when i could look back toward the part of the sky the box was in , it was gone.  i was also upset there weere no other witnesses, although many people were doiing activities around me, none of them were looking up, several were hispanic and i speak very little spanish.  there was a couple of cuacasian men working on a truck but i was afraid that the object would decide to fly away just as im trying to get the attention of these strangers, also this was a very low income area of the city, people dont approach each other easilly.  i know this report probably sounds very uninformeing, but what amazed me personally is the shape the object had. i would never have imageing a square shape as being something designed to fly thru the sky, how un aeodynamic could a square be. and the spinning, what pupose could spinning be for a craft. im ssorry i didnt file this report sooner. i didnt feel it was importand enough to be late for my job,  to phone the report in immediately, and after work i felt i was to late in reporting it as far as the purposes of a possible reconoscience by the air force;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
