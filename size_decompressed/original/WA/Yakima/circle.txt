I can’t say exactly why I waited so long to seek feedback except that it was nearly 30yrs ago, there weren’t near the resources then, if there were, I wasn’t aware of them and this isn’t a subject I felt I could talk to just anyone about without feeling I’d be thought of as a lunatic. I was 20yrs old at the time and lived off the North fork in Tampico, WA. I worked the swing shift 20+ miles from my home in Tampico. I made the long drive every single night at the same time (between 11:30 and 1am) and had never experienced anything like this prior to or since. In case you aren’t familiar with the area, there used to be a stop sign off of Ahtanum road when you arrive in Tampico. There was/is a little convenience store almost directly in front of the stop sign, maybe to the left a slight bit. At the stop sign, you can turn left, to go up the South fork, or turn right to go up the North fork. This particular evening as I began slowing down and pulled up to the stop sign, I looked to my left to see if any cars were coming, I didn’t see a single car on the road but what I did see instantly overwhelmed me with fear like I had never felt before. I felt like I was seeing something that I absolutely wasn’t supposed to see. There were 3 very large, approximately 15ft tall, round objects. All blocking the road to the south fork. I’m pretty sure I would not have been able to drive up the South fork if I needed to. Needless to say, I didn’t stop at the stop sign that night. I slowly continued on my way and took a slight right and drove up the North fork to my home. I didn’t see any lights on/in/around these objects. I didn’t see any humans or other lifeforms around the objects. They were all 3 different colors, but I don’t remember now what colors they were. There was absolutely nothing going on around them that I could see, just dark and silent. I remember thinking I shou! ld go home and wake my Mom and bring her back with me to get a better look but it was only a passing thought. I was too afraid something would happen to her. The next morning I had to fill in for someone so had to be back to work first thing in the morning. I was afraid to drive back by the area but it was light out by this time so I was a little more at ease. I anxiously wanted to see the objects in the light but when I drove back by the area around 5/6AM, they were gone. There was no sign of anything strange ever being there. I wish I had more info to provide. It wasn’t until years later that I realized these objects had to of somehow flown in there. I’m  not sure how that would be possible but they were so large that there’s no other way they could have gotten there, or left in such a short amount of time. I don’t remember the rest of my drive home after seeing these things. This is all I remember, unfortunately. My Mom did tell me that I woke her up when I got home and told her about what I had seen. If there’s anything you can tell me that might possibly help me to comprehend what I saw that night, I will be forever grateful. Thank you for your time.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
A strong light, a blue object, no noise, traveling south to north.;1998-04-22 21:30:00;2-3 seconds;A strong light, a blue object, no noise, traveling south to north. After hearing Mr. Davenport on the Art Bell program I thought I should pass this on.  On or about 4-22-98 but definitely around 2130 hours, something illuminated my backyard as well as the entire area.  It was much like lightening but of shorter duration.  I looked to the east and saw a round, blue object which instantly changed to red.  The object was traveling south to north at a high rate of speed with an altitude estimated to be 1500-3000 feet.  The downward descent angle I would estimate at 25-35 degrees.  There was no noise and the entire incident lasted 2-3 seconds.   I have not found another person who witnessed this incident.   The night was clear and no storms nearby.   Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a member of law enforcement.  We have spoken with him via telephone, and we consider him to be exceptionally reliable.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke again with this witness on Sunday, June 16, 2013, and his recollection of the sighting on that date was remarkably accurate.  He reported that he was at his home, at the time of the sighting, and that he was looking to the east.  The object was coursing from his left to right, descending at an estimated angle of descent of 30 degrees (as described above), and that the object's color changed instantly from robin egg blue to bright red, during the very short time that he observed it.

UFO event I witnessed with my husband 03/07/2011;2011-03-07 21:00:00;15 Min;UFO event I witnessed with my husband 03/07/2011 03-07-2011  Last night, Monday March 7, 2011, at about 9:00 p.m. my husband called me at the residence I was working at on Nth 60th Ave. In Yakima, WA. He was very excited and said step outside and look at the sky towards West Valley.  I stepped out and looked up and there were several bright orange lights flying in formation. I thought at first that they were helicopters because of the altitude they were flying and at the speed they were going.  They were flying in a way that made them look like they were floating.  I carefully listened but could hear no noises I would normally hear from a plane or from a helicopter.  One started to veer to their left as they were flying eastward looking as if they were going to fly over the location I was.  It immediately got back into formation.   It was very spooky no knowing for sure what they were or what they were doing. I ran back inside the house and waited for my husband to arrive, which was only a few moments since he was only a block away. Thank You,   ((name deleted));46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
March 7, 2011.  Yakima, WA West Valley UFO Sighting;2011-03-07 21:05:00;15 min;March 7, 2011 Yakima, WA  West Valley UFO Sighting RE: Questionable-UFO SIGHTING I am a 59 year old male.  Mentally and physically stable and retired.   On March 7, 2011 at @ 9:05 p.m. I was proceeding in a WESTERLY direction on TIETON DR.  I got to 60th AVE and turned right.  After making my turn, about ½ block, I stopped my car and called my wife who works 1 block away, on 60th Ave.  The evening sky was clear and the stars were clearly visable. As I looked up in a SOUTH-WESTERLY direction I saw some amber lights coming in my  direction. There were 9 Circular Amber Lights coming towards me.   At first sight they were coming at a sloping down-ward direction in a uniformed manner.  There was one at the front and 4 rows of two in each row.  They were moving in a SOUTH-EASTERN DIRECTION toward Ahatanum Ridge and toward the lower Yakima Valley.  They seem to be on a landing position in a down-ward direction, as if a plane was about to land at our airport.  It was just in front of me when they leveled out and all began to fly, in unison, straight towards Ahtanum Ridge.  The one thing I took note of was the fact that I could hear NO sound.  I have heard a lot of Jets fly over and a lot of helicopters, since we are so close to the Yakima Pomona Military Firing Center.  I did not hear the roar of jets or the rotor sound of a helicopter.  It was silent with no noise before, during or after seeing them. The end object (looking at the formation to the right rear of my sight) veered off slightly and came in my direction. It veered off for no more than to the count of 5 when it resumed its position of the formation.  The formation then continued straight toward Ahtanum Ridge.  As it got past the ridge the formation, in unison, began to move in an upward direction and in a matter of seconds they, one by one, began to disappear.  They all maintained speed and direction in unison.   I was trying to approximate their size and distance and thought them to be over the lower valley  before they disappeared from my sight.  I held my fist up to them, as they were in front of me at the initial sighting.   With my arm extended and  my fist in a ball they all disappeared, as they did with each appendage.  As I put up the small pinky finger it barely covered the front object allowing me to see the rest of the formation, a trick I learned in the Army. I contacted my wife, by cell, and she saw the whole scenario. I tried to get my new cell phone activated to shoot a picture or movie but was unable to do so before it disappeared. I got into my car and it was about 09:15  ((sic.  21:15 hrs.)). I called 911 and they said there were no other reported sightings called in and they advised me to call the UFO CENTER. I called the local paper, the Yakima Herald Republic, and was told that there were no other reports, like mine, and that they found it Not News Worthy.

Two bright circular objects in the sky, appearing every night for five weeks now.  ((NUFORC Note:  Planets in E sky.  PD));2012-05-24 03:00:00;2-3 hours;two bright circular objects in the sky, appearing every night for five weeks now. Appears around 3:10am around yakima training center direction, it lasts till around 4am, and can sometimes also see it during the morning in broad daylight (first seen on june 3, 12 - current).  One will start to rise over the mountain top into view and come up, and continue going up, along with the second brightest one about 15-20 minutes later (also there was only one in sky for the first 3 days). The second one is very odd because it's for one the brightest, and it appears to be just hovering over the hill top or just past it. They're both bright and circular in shape. They have also been appearing for about 4-5 weeks now. I've never seen it before until I saw it rise one day, and where I'm living, i've been here for a couple months now and have never seen it before. (along with several other witness' who agree.) I've called the yakima training center and of course have gotten no response. It freaked me out so bad the day I saw it, I actually called the police lol.  They said a police office was enroute to check things out but they never showed. I have a couple video's of it from the night I first saw it, and have sent them to the new's station for a possible explanation but no response either.  In total there has been 5 witness', and we all don't have any idea of what it could be.  They also never seem to go down, I know it might sound like stars (by god, I hope so) but it's so in your face.  I've been alive for a while and have never seen anything like this before.

Two Circular Uniformly Sized White Objects Travelling Parallel To The Horizon NNE of Yakima Washington;2015-10-27 19:05:00;2 seconds;Two Circular Uniformly Sized White Objects Travelling Parallel To The Horizon NNE of Yakima Washington Here is what I saw:  At 7:05 P.M.on 10-27-15,  I  was sitting outside on my patio in Yakima Washington.  It was dark outside.  The sky conditions were mostly cloudy and the nearly full moon had not yet arisen.   I saw two distinct white round objects about 30 degrees above the horizon in the NNW part ofthe sky.  They were of the same light intensity and size.  They moved for about two seconds almost parallel to the horizon in a ENE direction.  One object moved in a somewhat skewed trajectory from the trajectory of the other.  They were about the size in diameter 10 times the size of the average distant star.  Their speed was about 10 times that of a big plane you would see going overhead.  They traveled about 10 degrees across the sky in the two seconds.   There was no streaming breakup of material as a falling meteorite would show before it disintegrated.  This sighting was certainly not two planes, and if it were meteors, they were travelling at the wrong angle to the earth (almost parallel) and were the most uniform equally sized circular meteorites I have ever seen.   I hope someone else witnessed this. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite serious and sober-minded.  He described the event in a very eloquent, factual manner, and emphasized how bizarre the event looked to be.  PD));46.5955503124993;-120.548972375

Yakima, WA, downtown area...Monday 1-22-2018 330 am multiple witnesses..multiple objects lights..and one large craft!!;2018-01-22 03:30:00;15 minutes;Yakima WA  downtown area .. Monday 1-22-2018 330 am multiple witnesses..multiple objects lights..and one large craft!! Three lights in the sky blinking as if two on the side and on in the middle.  The sky was clear and no cloud cover.  Three of us watched these Lights blink off and on as they did not move.  Then suddenly three smaller craft arrived.  They showed up out of nowhere!  Two moved slow to the right and one began to climb at an incredible rate higher then the other objects and it was very bright.  As we watch this the largest object began to turn to it's right and I know because the way the lights moved.  As it turned, now this object had been sitting perfectly still for 10 minutes, and now it's moving and I can see that it's disk-shaped, and it's huge!   Then suddenly the area it was in seemed to magically have a cloud for it to vanish behind..it was as if it made it's own camo, and it was gone..sat and watched the other lights move away..about 13 minutes passed now...and now it's back!!!!  The largest is roated it's light back to it's original postion.  No cloud!!  Two of us decided to get in the car and go towards it.  As we headed towards the direction I saw what must have been five police cars some with there lights on no sirens some grouped together and other cutting up and down streets.  Then as I turned my vehicle away I saw a large..what I can only describe as ambulance type vehicle but twice as long white, no markings or plates??..with flashing red and orange lights .. When I got home I googled if anyone had seen anything..crazy cuz all these plates are suppose to be visible and then NASA even has a statement about being able to see the international space station tonight..now I don't recall anything in the paper about this, and I'm sure just like the eclipse we had everyone would of been outside to watch that..this was no space station..this was a large round craft with smaller craft in the same facility.  And the way it made it's own cloud!  I'm a complete skeptic but these wasnt what NASA said..this wasn't planets sattiles ...planets...it wasnt airplanes or helicopters..the planes would have been to close together and be able to hover at complete stand still.  And I'm aware helicopters can hover but the way it turned it was one large vechicle and vanished only to reappear..and the way the other smaller ones appeared out of thin air!!?!  And the bright one cutting be straight up.. commercial aircraft don't movie like that...  Yes the climb but the move towards a direction as they do.this cut throught the sky lime a razor higher and higher..fast!  then stopped...and as the large object made its first turn..the smaller bright craft was just gone, as if it bolted out of the atmosphere.  Also, the lights were not the same as a plane..very strange stuff. ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to contact by telephone the source of the report, but have not been successful in reaching him.  A Yakima newspaper, at NUFORC's suggestion, has attempted to find corroborating information about the alleged sighting, but has been unable to find any other reports related to the event.
