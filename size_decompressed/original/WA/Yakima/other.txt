Object disappears, car lights go off and on. I need to point out that the following event  was forgotten for several years.  And the other person in the car at the time still doesn't remember it taking place at all.  But I do remember during a trip from Pasco Washington to Yakima Washington.My friend ((Name deleted))and I were heading to Yakima in order to get another load, I was moving to Pasco.  It was late at night and we were going a little over the speed limit.  When I noticed a object flying in front of me, just off the road.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, then I noted that it wasn't making any sound and the lights on the aircraft were unconventional in that they rotated around the craft instead of flashing in place.  There were three colors of lights, I remember blue and green with either red or white lights.  They were rotating from my left to my right on the vehicle, which appeared as a dark shadow against the night sky.  The object was within a hundred yards of me and was cigar shaped, roughtly 20 feet wide and 8 feet with no wings or any appendages.  It was flying about 20 feet off the ground  In an attempt to get closer I speeded up to 90 miles an hour and the craft stayed in relative position to me.  Suddenly, the ship instantly speeded off to the nort!h and disappeared over a hill.  It moved with incredible speed.Suddenly my head lights went out.  I took my foot off the gas pedal and started breaking my vehicle.  I pressed the pedal a few times when the headlights came on again.  I was going to excelerate when they went off again.  I continued to break and the lights came on again.  They came on again and I noticed a  field access road off the highway and not wanting to break down on the road turned into it.  ((Name deleted)) and I got out of the car and relieved ourselves by the car.As I said before, I forgot this whole event for a matter of several years.   It was only after a discussion on UFO's that I remembered the event.  This is the first time that I have reported it to anyone other then close friends and work associates.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Three star-like objects were spotted heading north from 9:30-9:32 and 11:00-11:05 at night.;2003-08-06 21:30:00;21:30-21:32 and 23:00-23:;Three star-like objects were spotted heading north from 9:30-9:32 and 11:00-11:05 at night. At 9:30 at nigh, while my friend and I were ooking at the stars, we spotted a star-like object moving norhtwest. At first we thought it was a satellite, but it was moving much faster.After about 30 seconds it dissapeared. Then, right after that, another of these objects appeared (moving northeast) and after about 2 minutes it took off in the blink of an eye. Lastly, at his house, another of my friends spotted another of these objects moving north at 11:00 at night. He kept watching it untill it took off in the blink of an eye at 11:05 During the 9:30-932 sighting there were around three airplanes flying around, but they didn't seem to follow or even notice the objects because the objects were much higher and looked like ordinary stars. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have observed the three satellites, which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite surveillance system.  One of three reports from the same witness.  PD));46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
ship over Hospital in Yakima, Wa. on September 29,2006;2006-09-29 08:45:00;5 min.;ship over Hospital in Yakima, Wa. on September 29,2006 I was going to Yakima Providence Hospital at 110 s 9 ave. in Yakima, WA.  I had to be there at 9:00am, so it was somewhere between 8:45 and 8:55.  We parked (My Mom) and we were walking towards the entrance when for some reason I looked up and saw this ship right above the hospital just sitting there.  I said What's that? and my mom said I don't know  It looked like two ships on their sides hooked in the middle, like two dinner plate bottom to bottom, with something in the middle.  We looked at them for a good 5 min. and all these people were walking by and no one would look up, so my mom finally stopped a lady and asked her what it was, she looked and said I don't know and walked away, it was funny.  I was running late, so we went into the hospital.  I was hoping while we were watching it, would zip away or something, but no!   My Mom left me in the hospital and came back out about 10 minutes later and it was gone.   I went back about 2 weeks later and looked, nothing, that could of been it either.  Has anyone else reported seeing one on that date in Yakima?;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375

I got in my truck and left the rest area and started to gain speed and then one buzzed my truck from behind with no lite this time but just as fast and alot closer. this is my fourth encounter with ufo's in washington state .;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Bright orange light hovered over Yakima, WA.;2014-03-07 21:05:00;10 minutes;Bright orange light hovered over Yakima, WA. Bright orange light, in the shape of a spiral Christmas tree ornament, hung in the southern sky over Yakima, WA, at about 45 degrees from the earth.   The object/light hovered and slowly rotated then disappeared (not moving away) within 10 minutes of spotting it.   We were attracted to the light because of its contrast with the white starlight.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Three lights two red , one white light moving every direction in the middle.;2014-05-20 22:05:00;1 minute;Three lights two red, one white light moving every direction in the middle. I was looking out my window at around 10:05 at night, when I looked south and i saw three lights.  The two outer lights were flashing red, but flashing every 3 seconds and at the same time.  The middle light was white and moving in all directions, it looked like it was a UFO being followed by two other UFO's guarding it, so I ran downstairs to my brother, so we went outside to check it out.    The UFO was about 1 mile wide and moving south east at about the same rate or faster than a regular aircraft.  We tried to call my brothers girlfriend because she has seen UFO's that look like this one but the call wouldn't go through the servers, after it was moving north east towards Spokane, Washington, I saw another small one but with out the white light in the middle.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Extremely loud sound accompanied by vibrations (5-7 min duration) occurred twice in 10-day period in Yakima County, WA in early AM.;2019-11-10 02:00:00;5-7 minutes;Extremely loud sound accompanied by vibrations (5-7 min duration) occurred twice in 10-day period in Yakima County, WA in early AM. Approximately 2am in the morning, I and others I know awoke to a very large mechanical sound with vibrations coming from the sky.  The vibrations were so powerful, the house was shaking similar to minor earthquake.  Both myself, my wife, and others that I have spoken to also witnessed (heard) the event.  The event lasted 5-7 minutes.  After going outside to see what the sound was, there was nothing visible creating the sound and vibrations.  I have spoken to several others that witnessed (heard) the event at several locations in the Upper and Lower Yakima Valley.  I am an aircraft pilot and have flown and been in many types of planes, and this sound was not from any piston, turbine or jet engine.  People described the sound as if standing next to the launch pad of a rocket.  I have spoken to others that stated similar event occurred 10 days earlier on 11/1/2019.  In an attempt to record a future event, video cameras (on hillside overlooking valley and pointed to sky) have been set to start recording upon loud sound and will hopefully record any future event.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
