I was searching for photo opportunities one evening when I spotted an unusual object moving south to north on the western horizon during sunset. I snapped a photo,and then another clearly showing movement of the object. It was descending when it went out of sight behind some bushes. This was not a man-made object nor was it a weather anomaly. Then roughly three months later I captured 7 more photos of the same object at the same height also travelling north, and also descending. Only this time I captured the object on the eastern horizon during sunrise on December 1st 2006.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
