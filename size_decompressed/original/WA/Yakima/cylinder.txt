It didnt appear to have wings and it looked the same on both ends;2011-09-23 13:19:00;5;I went outside at about 13:14 to pick some vegitables in my back yard, after doing tomatoes i went to pick some straw berries.  While at my strawberries i looked up in the sky towards the north and noticed what looked like a jet liner, the only thing is that it didnt appear to have wings and it looked the same on both ends.  Both ends appeard to be some what square and there was something in the middle of it.  It was clear and sunny, i didnt hear any noise coming from it like the other jet liners that fly that route.  As it disappeared to the east it started shining from the sun, i think it was polished metallic metal. It seem to be powered by some type of levitation because of the way it was moving, it seem to be floating because it was moving very slow. Ive never seen anything like this before.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
