Strange Yellow White Light in the sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Flare from Iridium satellite.  PD));2004-08-19 10:29:00;5-8 seconds;Strange Yellow White Light in the sky 8/19/04 10:29 PST My husband and I were sitting outside talking and happened to look up to the North East when we saw what we thought was a sattelite.  The strange thing was that it suddenly got very bright, brighter than any star in the sky, yellow/white light, for maybe a second then it dimmed and continued for a brief couple of seconds then disappeared.  I know what you're thinking, and it was not a shooting star.  I have never seen a shooting star dim then get really bright then dim and disappear.  ((NUFORC Note:  Flare from Iridium satellite.
