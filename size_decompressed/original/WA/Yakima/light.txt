Hovering, Darting Lights Over Tampico, Washington State;1978-08-01 21:00:00;5 min. approx;Hovering, Darting Lights Over Tampico, Washington State During the summer of 1978 (or 1979), I was camping with my family, cousins, aunt & uncle at “Tree Phones”, which is located in the Tampico area, east of Darlene Mtn. in Yakima County, Washington state. We were sitting around the campfire & saw a UFO that was traveling from  the west to the east. The lights were high in the air & we would have thought it was an airplane if it didn’t hover & dart in a zig-zag direction. The UFO continued to travel in this manner, hovering briefly & then darting in a zig-zag fashion. It continued in this manner, until it was out of sight. It also had multi-colored lights.

Four very bright yellow stationary  lights in a 20 degree arc, fading out then popping up in a different position.;2000-06-20 01:25:00;10 minutes;Four very bright yellow stationary  lights in a 20 degree arc, fading out then popping up in a different position. I looked out of the window towards the north-east and saw four very bright stationary yellow lights. They were slightly above the hills in a clear sky. As I watched, the lights alternated fading out and then popping on again in a different position.  The  original formation was about a 20 degree arc. I grabbed my binoculars and ran out on the porch, focused on them and they seemed to be partial circles of light with one straight line  coming out of each. But far away, even with magnification still about the size of a pencil eraser. As they each faded, it was like they got  farther away, very rapidly. Seemed to be some faint vapor  trails drifting off of them, but not like any plane I've ever seen.  Finally it was just two, then one, then that one receded. I'm loading up the video camera tonight so this time I'll be ready!;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Just a light;2001-06-05 00:01:00;8 minutes;Just a light I went out onto my back porch to smoke a cigarette after SportsCenter, I was just looking to the NW when a light started to appear like a flashlight having a cover of some type being pulled up from in front of it, the bottom? of the light appeared first. It got about as bright as a streetlight, and at first I though that was what it was.  It was to low and silent to be an aircraft. As I kept watching it it seemed to sort of slowly and almost imperceptibly bob, for a couple moments I was wondering if it was me rather than the light that was moving, then it moved to my left behind some trees and I lost sight of it. It was just the one light, like a streetlight no craft that I saw. I am a college student and fulltime cook and have never seen anything tnat I would call a UFO before.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Very fast moving and maneuvering light in sky above Washington State......;2003-08-08 03:00:00;1.5 minutes;Very fast moving and maneuvering light in sky above Washington State...... I was driving my truck when I looked in my rear view mirror to see if anyone was following me and there it was.  It rose from behind a hill like maybe it was warming up it's engine or something, and then, WHOOSH (no sound)it took off at warp speed.  I got video footage of it on my super 8.  Man was it cool.  No government on this Earth has anything in their defense inventory that could move like that at that speed, and nowhere near as fast.  On some following nights, I took more footage of more of them.  I got about 4-5 minutes maybe.  It was just a white light with maybe a slight yellowish tint to it.  I tried to give it to George Noory but he doesn't want it.  He doesn't return any emails.  I can send you guys the videotape if you want. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the video.  PD));46.5955503124993;-120.548972375

Light....duration 10-15 minutes;2006-04-24 23:15:00;10 minutes;Light....duration 10-15 minutes As I was looking due north, observed a non-blinking light coming from the Western horizon heading due East at about 25 degrees below the zenith, at about same velocity as a jetliner (getting brighter until it reached halfway across the sky...brighter than Venus). But just before it got halfway across the sky it slowly began to turn N.E. and continued going N.E. and slowly got dimmer and dimmer until it reached about 10 degrees above the horizon and went out!

Fast, white, solid light.  ;2007-06-21 21:30:00;10 seconds;Fast, white, solid light I'm usually skeptical about these, but I saw a curious light this evening around 9:30pm.  My wife saw it and said probably a plane.   But I had watched 4 other aircraft fly overhead and this object was different.  It was about a third as bright as Venus and maybe about 2/3 the size.  It looked like a star, definitely had an altitude greater than any of the aircraft I'd seen.  Just a bright, white light. What was odd to me was that it moved at a much greater speed than any of the aircraft.  I saw it coming from the southern horizon, moving smooth and fast, it disappeared over the northern horizon only 10 seconds later. I've never seen anything that high cover that much ground in such a short amount of time.  I thought possibly satellite, but south to north?  Weird.   The other weird thing is that every plane I've ever seen had at least some sort of blinking lights, even if only one. This was a single, solid white light. ((NUFORC Note: ISS??

BRIGHT LIGHT IN SKY TURNS INTO SMALL LIGHT IN A BLINK OF THE EYE AND FLYS NORTH UPWARD INTO THE SKY;2008-06-30 23:30:00;20 SECONDS;BRIGHT LIGHT IN SKY TURNS INTO SMALL LIGHT IN A BLINK OF THE EYE AND FLYS NORTH UPWARD INTO THE SKY Around 11:30 or 12 at night on June 30th of 2008, me and 2 female friends were up on the canal located in Terrace Heights looking toward Mount Adams. I happened to look up threw my moon roof of my car and noticed a bright white light toward Mount Adams which was at a south west direction from our location, but it seemed to be right over Yakima. At first I thought it was a airplane but it had no flashing lights like an airplane. I also observed an airplane fly by this object, the airplane was heading towards Seattle. When I realized the object was not a airplane I told my female friends “what is that”. My friend in the passenger seat tried to look at it threw the moon roof but didn’t see it, so she looked out the window, as she did that the light just in a blink of the eye turned very small like a star in the sky. Me and her observed the object fly north in a upward direction until it vanished into space. I have talked to another female friend of mine who also said her and another friend had seen this light at the same time for about 20 minutes, they were on Mead and 13th ave looking south west when they observed the light. I was wondering if anyone else has seen this light and also see it fly away.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375

Do not know how long it had been there. Since there are no stars in that part of the sky at that time of the morning I waited to see if it would move...but it did not. After about 5 minutes I went to go back in and again looked in the same direction, but alas it was gone!!!! ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I sent a report earlier re: twinkling light. The other night, a plane was coming in for a landing at the local airport and was exhibiting the same characteristics.  But this time I witnessed it turning.

The same thing happened the next night, and in the same position as before. After that, the sky was cloudy for several nights. When it did clear up, they were gone...and have not appeared since.

I immediately saw a very bright star-like object directly in front of me, to the right (east) of the Big Dipper, below the bottom right star in the dipper part.  It was moving quickly, but not flashing like an airplane light.   I could not hear a sound from it, which I would have if it were an airplane, because this is a rural area, and it was very quiet out at the time.   It was about as high as a small plane would be flying also, so I definitely would have heard the engine.   The light moved to the east, and went behind my poplar trees, so I lost track of it after a few seconds.   I kept looking for it to come out from behind the trees, but never did see it.  It was brighter than any satellites I have ever seen, so I doubt it could have been one.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
