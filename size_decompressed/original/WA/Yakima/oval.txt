Butterly shaped rainbow UFO;2003-07-01 02:00:00;5 MINUTES;Butterly shaped rainbow UFO I saw an oval shaped object in the Northern sky around the height of the surrounding hills.  At first I thought it was coming from the Yakima Firing Center but after watching for about 30 seconds, started doubting that idea.  It was oval in shape and pulsated rainbow colors around the oval shape.  It moved straight to the right, than straight down, back to the left, back straight up and than ro the right again.  What was unique about this was when the object moved, the rainbow colors that were pulsating around the oval shape, extended into what I can best describe as butterfly wings on both sides of the object.  It was very pretty to watch.  I could only see the rainbow colors in the butterfly wings when it moved, not when it was stationary.  I was watching my puppy who got me up and went back inside for a few minutes.  When I came back out it was gone.  The next morning I looked in the vicinity that I saw this object, wondering if one of the surrounding hills was there.  There were no hills, just blue sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

multi-color objects in the sky, one soared above our heads.;2011-04-18 21:20:00;1 hour;multi-color objects in the sky, one soared above our heads. At first it looked like a flickering star, then I noticed it was very bright and was flickering blue, green, white, yellow and red...kind of like a plane.  But it just sat there in the same spot.  I was looking around thinking maybe it was just my eyes, when I noticed there were about 4 others just like it but further away.  After a while the first bright one we saw started moving towards us and slowly illuminated turning into a pale yellow color and got extremely bright!  It looked like a huge light almost an oval shape (imagine a headlight in the dark with a halo around it)   As it sped up and moved across the sky above us (not as fast as a shooting star, but much faster than an airplane) and got further away it slowly turned red and soon got so far away it was out of sight.  The other 4 objects remained in the same spot as they were when we first saw them.  Soon, we went inside and that was the last we saw of the flickering objects.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
