Three delta shaped objects flying in a v formation passed over Yakima, Wash. at22:10 on 07/20/01;2001-07-20 22:10:00;4-5 SECS.;Three delta shaped objects flying in a v formation passed over Yakima, Wash. at22:10 on 07/20/01 I was in my hot tub watching airliners traveling generally on a s.east to n.west course when I saw three object traveling in a v formation on the same general heading but at a much lower altitude.  These objects were difficult to see against the dark night sky, but were more visible when they passed below scattered clouds.  They gave off no light,made no sound and could be mistaken for night flying birds if they were nit so fast.  The two outboard objects came close together and then return to their original posions.  The object did not seem to oscillate ,flap or vibrate.  My best guess as to the altitude was 3000-4000 feet. ((NUFORC Note:  Three reports of these objects, seen on this night, and also several nights later.  We do not know what they are, but they seem to fly like transport a/c.  They may be large military aircraft practicing low-level flight at night.  PD));46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Chevron shape of pale white/yellow lights flying overhead with no sound.;2010-09-28 22:00:00;5 seconds;Chevron shape of pale white/yellow lights flying overhead with no sound. Happened to be looking up at the right time.   It was warm and clear, maybe hi 60's and we (husband and I, (I'm a homemaker) were showing our son the big dipper constellation.  We were all looking up in that general direction for about one minute, when I saw it. I'd like to note that there is a sort of lighthouse style arm or ray of light, very faint that rotates over the apartment complex that we live in.  I'm not sure of its source.  But it's always there night after night, probably/maybe from a local building.  The arm of light is such that if the cloud cover is low, the light seems to skim the bottom of the clouds.  The light makes a full rotation about every 7 seconds.  I just went outside (it's now 23:20) to time it and it wasn't on.  So not sure what that is about.  I'm not outside this late very often. I was looking up and following the faint pale search light with my eyes as it was skimming the sky (right above my head, I was looking straight up)  when in the lights path was a chevron shape of lights ( it reminded me of those black military stealth bomber planes in the shape of it.)  The sighting lasted about 5 seconds and it seemed to be smoothly flying across the sky heading from east to west.  The lights were tiny and a faint yellow/white color.  The stars making up the big dipper were brighter and bolder.  It's hard to recall but maybe there were 10 or fewer lights.  As it traveled away from me it was even harder to keep my eyes on it (the lights bordering the shape got less intense as it flew away)  and about 5 seconds later it seemed to disapear into the blackness of the night sky.  I couldn't follow it as far as I could follow an airplane in the night sky.  I'd like to note that it made NO SOUND.  I was excitely trying to direct my husband to see it, but, like I sa! id the event was so quick and had my eye been still looking at the big dipper itself, I'm pretty sure I would have never caught a glimpse of it .;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
Bright crescent shaped craft quickly flying across the sky.;2012-11-04 00:00:00;5 seconds;Bright crescent shaped craft quickly flying across the sky. This was a sighting that occurred between midnight of November 3rd and 4th and the sight was seen within my car at a stoplight.  Both me and the passenger looked out the window to see an intense bright crescent shape beem across the sky within a matter of seconds with a small trail of light following the shape.  The craft vanished as quickly as it appeared and there was nothing left to be seen afterwards.  Was very large in respect to viewing from the car, about the size of a quarter when held away at arms length.
