It was hard to see with the naked eye so I got out my binoculars which helped , but it was still rather small . We watched it stay in one spot for about five minutes and then it moved 20 degrees to the NW and hoovered there for 2-3 more minutes when it was joined by #2 craft. We watched a round , silver or white object hoovering between Yakima and Ellensburg Wa. It was hard to see with the naked eye so I got out my binoculars which helped , but it was still rather small . We watched it stay in one spot for about five minutes and then it moved 20 degrees to the NW and hoovered there for 2-3 more minutes when it was joined by #2 craft.It stationed itself 20 degrees to the east . When observed with the binocs we precieved movement or rotation . At that time I was focused on #2 for thirty seconds with the binocs when it started to move to the south and I lost it when it got over the roofline of my house . At that time my neighbor was wathing #1 which moved while he was tring to look for #2. We beleive this all took place over a 10 to 15 minute period when my neighbor first sighted and then notified me. They seemed to be at a very high altitude as we noted commuter air traffic but teree was no way to judge this. Please note that the next day I got a glimpse of a simular object for 2 seconds or less , it was at a lower altitude.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375

Four lights on the Fourth;2012-07-04 22:15:00;5 minutes;Four lights on the Fourth We were in the parking lot at 24th Ave. & Nob Hill Blvd. to watch the fireworks show from the fairgrounds.  The fireworks show was almost at its end.  Then, something caught my eye near the full moon.  The moon was about 30 degrees up from the horizon and mostly to the south of us. There were four orange spheres moving away from the sight of the moon.  These four lights were in a straight line and appeared to be moving towards us. The line that they were traveling looked like they were coming up from the SE direction.  This is a used flight pattern from Pendleton, OR to Seattle, WA. These lights were moving slowly along the sight of the full moon.  One person, who was also distracted from the fireworks show, asked us what those light were.  It was at that time that the lights began to fade out.  One by one, the light slowly faded as they past over the line sight of the moon. We wait for some time later to see if they were just high flying planes.  If they were, they would have flew over a short time later.  We waiting for about another 20 minutes.  There was no sign of anything in the night sky. Where did they go? Another cool mystery.;46.5955503124993;-120.548972375
