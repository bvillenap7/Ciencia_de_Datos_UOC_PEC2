Black triangular craft vibrates me out of sleep, blocks out sky.

Heard you want past reports, so here you go. Before I'd ever heard of Art Bell or triangular craft, I had an experience that shook me - literally. I was deep asleep one night when something stirred me. In that dreamy consciousness you get I remember feeling like I was vibrating. I thought I heard a noise and remember thinking, What is a jumbo jet doing flying over Ocean Shores? The noise got louder over several minutes until I thought to myself this thing is going to crash right on the beach. I sat up, fully awake. The noise was gone and I realized I hadn't actually heard it audibly, that it was more like a sub-sonic vibration. I ran outside and looked up into the sky and saw a formation of seven red lights overhead. At first I thought it was a very slow moving formation of helicopters. But then I back and got my glasses. When I returned I could see that it was instead a single, triangular shape. I could judge this because the it was a partially overcast night and I could see the orange glow of the town's streetlights (about half-mile away) everywhere except between the small red lights. I stood stunned as the craft passed overhead slowly, moving from south to north along the coastline. I estimate it was only a couple of hundred feet above and travelling about 10 mph. I can't estimate the width, but see the following diagram: craft \---------------/ \             / \           / \         / \       / \     / approx. 60 degree angle ------ me -------- Next morning I was ready to write the whole story off and convinced myself that it had actually been a squad of helicopters. Later that afternoon I was in one of the local shops talking to the owner when a friend of her's came in and said he had seen something exciting. I had never met this man before, or told anyone about my experience, but he went on to describe what he called the mother ship exactly as I had seen it. He added that this was not the first time he had seen craft of this type in the North Beach area. When I asked, the man said that his sighting had been in the Copalis Beach area, about 10 miles north of Ocean Shores.

Saw three objects flying in triangular formation over the Ocean, OR it was one large craft. Monday, March 6th, 4:30am;2000-03-06 04:30:00;2 minutes;Saw three objects flying in triangular formation over the Ocean, OR it was one large craft. Monday, March 6th, 4:30am My girlfriend and I went to Ocean Shores, Washington over the weekend. We stayed at a hotel right next to the Ocean. At 4:30am on Monday, March 6th, I was out on the deck looking at the stars, and trying to hear what the drunk neighbors were yelling about.. Anyway, I went back to looking up at the sky, and at approximately 2-o-clock my position (NorthWest), out over the Ocean I saw what appeared to be a slow moving star or satellite...Cool. No big deal I thought. You see satellites all the time in the night sky. But what made this sighting take on a whole new dimension was that there was another one slightly cocked at an angle trailing it, but at a fixed position. So I thought, 2 satellites travelling together? Do they do that? Then, I noticed yet ANOTHER satellite, this one trailing both the first two, but at the SAME moving, fixed position. So all of a sudden I realized I was now looking at either: A) Three craft or satellite, moving together in perfect triangular formation -or- B) ONE very large craft, shaped like a backwards triangle... This is what I saw... W -----> N First seen satellite +< Third seen satellite +< Second seen Satellite +< The thing I need to find out now is if satellites do travel in fixed formation relative to one another. If so, then that's what I saw. If NOT, well then...;46.9718;-124.157
