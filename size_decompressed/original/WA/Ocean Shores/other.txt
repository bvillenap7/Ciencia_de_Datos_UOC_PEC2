Extremely high rate of speed fuzzy large red ball.;2015-12-30 19:10:00;30 seconds;Extremely high rate of speed fuzzy large red ball Our family rents a house every year which is located near the southern end of Ocean Shores, Washington.   My son and I were outside down by the channel, enjoying the night sky.  He was laying down on a bench, looking up at the stars and I was looking out towards the east over the canal.  He noticed a red, blurry light, which was moving quickly from the west to the east.  Since he wears contacts he thought it was just something to do with his contacts, so he said nothing.   A few seconds later I saw a large, red, fuzzy ball, moving at extreme speed, coming from the north, headed southbound.  It made a extremely sharp right hand turn and flew south of our position, but parallel to us headed west out to sea.   We both looked at each other in disbelief for a few moments couldn't say anything.   I can tell you that the amount of see that it took in the turn would've certainly cause the human out from the g forces.;46.9718;-124.157
