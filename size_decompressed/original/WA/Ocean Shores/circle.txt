((name deleted))  Date of encounter:  October 11, 2016.  Location: Ocean Shores Wa. Time: 1:35 PM   We had just passed the Quinault Casino and state park on the main road to the Town of Ocean Shores when my wife noticed a object in the sky.  The sky was clear with no clouds in the sky.  The object was white and had a strange tail but the way this thing was positioned in the sky the tail was going almost straight up which should have had the object going down but it seemed to be going south from us, and not losing any altitude, just moving away from us and getting smaller and smaller until it just disappeared.   I am a Air Force vet and my job was airborne radar and this was no airplane or balloon.  You could clearly see that the object was round with this funny tail.  The outline of the object was very clear with no lights or identifying marks on it.  The sighting lasted about 1 Â½ minutes until is was gone.  It did not disappeared over the horizon it just got smaller until it was gone remaining high in the sky. Thank You;46.9718;-124.157
