It then started to move away slowly and then quickly disappeared in just a few seconds.  After that quick move I felt compelled to send this report.

Bright light moving upwards between Serius and Orions Belt.;2014-02-28 09:35:00;~10 seconds;Bright light moving upwards between Serius and Orions Belt I had just walked out on the deck and was looking up at the night sky in a S/SW direction and saw a gold light moving from Sirius to Orion's Belt at a high rate of speed.  It looked similar to a shooting star but did not seem quite as fast and was moving upward.  It blinked out just below the left star of Orion's belt and I didn't see anything further.;46.9718;-124.157

Noticed a star moving at 90 degree turns quickly and eraticly changing directions faster than anything I've witnessed before.  It did this for about 3 to 4 minutes.  No sound. Basically a star on some joyride.  I know what I saw.;46.9718;-124.157

I returned to bed and on my way to bed, I could see a particularly bright red pulsing light stationary towards the west over the ocean. I watched it for a minute through our window over the bed and my wife awaken and I told her she has to see this.   She popped up and instantly saw what at first to me had looked like a very bright Mars but by the time she got up and was observing it it had doubled in magnitude.  You could see all the other stars in the sky around it which had there normal bluish color but this was orange red and it began pulsing.  We both were in amazement as to what it was.  It remained stationary.  After several minutes of it getting progressively brighter, all of a sudden it got very bright then completely just vanished.  It did not fly away but just went out.   I am a retired school teacher and my wife a real estate agent and are rational people but this was as clear as it could be.  We have not seen! anything like it before over the ocean at night here at our beach home.  Unexplainable both of us felt as if it knew we were watching it and disappeared, but then again we do believe in life on other planets but this took us by surprise.  And all the facts of the visual observation are facts but the feeling part we understand is subjective however it was very strange feeling watching it just disappear when all the backdrop of stars remain plenty bright.  Thank you;46.9718;-124.157

10 to 15 lights moving slowly over my beach house in a moving group.;2021-05-15 18:00:00;90 seconds;10 to 15 lights moving slowly over my beach house in a moving group. It was late in the evening but still light out. From my front deck I looked up at the sky and saw 10 to 15 lights or maybe orbs. The sky was mostly clear with a light blue background. I live on the beach and was shocked to see all of those lights together but each was one was slowly moving on its own and all were coming over my house heading SW in like a group. I watched them slowly move SW maybe towards Portland. I am 78 years old and and they sure got my attention!;46.9718;-124.157
