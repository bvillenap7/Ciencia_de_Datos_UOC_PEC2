We were watching the waves walking on the beach as I noticed a bright light a ways out into the ocean moving very fast.  After pointing it out, it disappeared.  But then appeared again at one point in the horizon and then moved very quickly across the horizon to another point to where it disappeared again.  It did this for around 15 minutes repeating the same route.  I tried to catch it on video on my phone but it was too far out to pick up on video.  We noticed many other people on the beach pointing at it.   I did manage to take some pics on my phone and when I zoomed in on the pics when I got home, I noticed some odd results.   There was some other odd occurrences also around this time.  A huge ship that was close to the beach all the sudden was gone, which was off because they don't move that fast, a small prop plane was flying around and then all the sudden was gone and there was a commercial looking airplane flying over around that time and just seemed to be gone.   Those things didn't seem to be too weird at the time but with the UFO sighting, it was a very eerie moment.  It was like  Wait, what?, What the heck is going on right now?! kind of moment.;46.9718;-124.157
