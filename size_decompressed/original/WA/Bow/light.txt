I excited out of Bow going south on I-5, I kept glancing at the moon which was at my right side windshield, then all of a sudden I saw what appeared to be a star falling down from the sky, no angles or nothing just straight down, perpendicular in relation to ground, it came down straight as an arrow, it was a little to the left of the moon, and I saw it fell for about two seconds then it disappeared behind the pine trees. “What he heck was that!” those are my exact words and repeated it two more times. I was stunned. The time would be around 0315, and I think I was between the Bow and Cook rd exit. At first I thought, ok, it’s just a satellite or a reflection on my windshield, but it came down with no angles, it fell straight I mean straight, which was really strange.
