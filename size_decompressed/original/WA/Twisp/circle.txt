My husband went outside last night to get our big dog and bring her inside for the night.  He came in and told me that there was a strange light above Twisp.  I went out with him and saw in the eastern sky a bright light that was similar to a rising planet but was maybe 5 times larger and GREEN!  The object was incredibly glittery and after getting the binoculars I could see a red light inside it that seemed to be pulsing around the object.  While it was there I looked up in the sky and saw a soft golden light traveling over head.  This object could have been a plane, but there were no other lights on it and it seemed to be floating in a different way.  As we watched it it slowly faded away into nothingness.  This object seemed to closer to us.  Meanwhile the green light was still in the sky.  My husband went inside to call his brother to see if he could see it and I sat with the binoculars watching it.  I confirmed that though it was low in the sky, it was not on the mountain, because I could see stars below it.  As I was watching it disappeared by rapidly extinguishing.  It just went out.  After that there seemed to be no more activity.  I don't know why I didn't grab my camera, but I didn't. Also notable is that the green glittering object did not move around the sky at all. We are a couple in our forties with three children 9-11.  We work as woodworker/real estate investor and ceramic artist.  We have lived in Twisp for 19  years.;48.3669;-120.1327
