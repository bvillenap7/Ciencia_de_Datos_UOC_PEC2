bright amber-colored light drifts silently across the evening sky;2011-08-25 20:45:00;20 sec;bright amber-colored light drifts silently across the evening sky I was on a hill taking evening photos with my camera and tripod when I felt something watching me so I looked at the northern sky and happened to look right at this glowing object.  My 1st thought was Venus because it was the same size and brightness of Venus.  I continued taking photos of the sunset when I felt compelled to look at the object again and that's when I quickly remembered Venus is located further south and is a different color I also noticed this bright, amber colored light was drifting near me and then it arched slowly and drifted off on a southerly direction. This is the 6th time to see this in a year.  I always think it's Venus at first for some reason!  I was able to point my camera towards this object and take a time exposure of it as it glided across the sky away from me.  It's low in the sky, though it appear to be high up in the photograph.  I live in a military fly-zone so I'm pretty sure this is not a civilian craft. I have one other photo of this image that I took back in June of this year...I will gladly post it too....;48.3669;-120.1327
