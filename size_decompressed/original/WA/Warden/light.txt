Lights in the sky over Washington State;1976-06-18 21:00:00;15 min.;Lights in the sky over Washington State It was in the mid-70's that this siteing happened. I was around 9 or 10 years old. It was a very dark night, with no moon in the sky, so the stars were very clear. I was living in the Eastern part of Washington state, which is largely farm land. I remember being called out of the house to come and see something. What I saw was several lights, about 7 or 8, moving around in the Eastern sky. They looked no different than the stars, except that they were moving. They floated around each other for awhile, then one or two of them would streak off and vanish, only to appear in the opposite direction from where it went. Sometimes the objects would merge, then spread out from each other. This went on for about 15 to 20 minutes, it could have been more. My father, who is a farmer, along with my mother, brother, and sister all saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));46.9772;-119.0577
Star-like lights moving across sky and re-occurring.;2014-08-15 21:38:00;3 minutes;star like lights moving across sky and re accuring Hello, I would like to start off by saying this is no hoax or joke, what my cousin and I saw is real and im 99.9% shure its not a military craft.  what we saw and continue to see every night around the same time is a light that moves across the sky very quick and not in one general direction either, sometimes they disappear and reappear, we have seen airplanes flying and the light are completely different and the speed is very slow compared to the light we see.  this event occurs every night between 8 and 12, tonight ill try to get video to send in to you.  this literally happens every night we look for it.  I would really like to get someone else to see this that can maybe tell if its a plane of somesort or really a ufo.  The color of these are white they look exactly like a moving star, sqame brightness and color but they move quick.   please contact me I have called the hotline and left my number so I look forward to hearing from you soon.  thank you;46.9772;-119.0577
