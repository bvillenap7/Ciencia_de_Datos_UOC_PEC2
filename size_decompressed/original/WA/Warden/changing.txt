We continue to watch it for about 10 mins, until it started to come closer.  It stopped as it started getting closer, and flashed bright lights.   Then it shape shifted into a aircraft.  When it flew over we heard nothing.  Also, two satellite looking things came out from underneath it.   Tried take a video but it didn't even show up or wanted to work and I have a brand new phone too.  Weird.  Got a photo though thankfully of its bright light.;46.9772;-119.0577
