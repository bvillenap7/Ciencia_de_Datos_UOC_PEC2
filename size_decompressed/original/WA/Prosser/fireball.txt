A burning object with long tail, falling out of the sky towards the ground.;2014-09-12 20:19:00;5 seconds;A burning object with long tail, falling out of the sky towards the ground. On Friday evening, September 12th, at 8:19 pm, I saw a very bright light that appeared as a burning object falling out of the sky.   I live in Prosser, Washington, and I was facing approximately 290deg azimuth or a little North of due West.  It lasted about 5 seconds and from my viewpoint it appeared to moving vertically directly towards the ground. It was big enough and slow enough that I definitely had the impression it would impact the ground and I would see an impact flash.  However it either appeared to burnout before impact or traveled below my horizon which is the Cascade Range (approx 75 miles away), though it appeared closer than that to me.  More like 40 to 50 miles away. If I had to describe its appearance, I would say it looked like the sparkling white/gold spark remnants of a very large fireworks shell as it drifts to the ground after exploding if you were sitting in the immediate vicinity of the launch area.  The speed was similar to that type of occurrence as well. To be clear though, there was no explosion, noise or flash preceding its appearance. Just the appearance of a sparkling trail of burning material that started very high in the horizon and came straight down.
