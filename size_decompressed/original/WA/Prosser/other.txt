A cloud UFO releases an object near Prosser Washington;2020-12-16 13:27:00;00:00:45;A cloud UFO releases an object near Prosser Washington I was with my wife, driving from Kennewick to Seattle. We were having a conversation about a movie we watched the night before. While I looked over to her, I saw an object that was being covered by a cloud. I have never seen a cloud that big and that close to the ground. I pointed it out to my wife and she initially only noticed the cloud. She didn’t think much of it because she’s seen a single cloud like that before. We looked again and a black funnel came from the back end of the cloud. It looked like a tornado or something that was heading towards the ground. But in the funnel, an object came from within it, like it’s hiding. It reminded me of a scene from the Movie, War of the Worlds, when the aliens traveled through the lighting. The object looked like an aircraft. There wasn’t an explosion or fire and we never actually saw it hit the ground, it was too far away to see while driving away from the scene. Once the cloud released the object, the funnel ret! urned to the cloud and the black portion traveled to the front in and the cloud disappeared.;46.2213;-119.7729
