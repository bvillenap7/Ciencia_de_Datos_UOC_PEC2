Light in the sky moving from south to north with weird up and down movements. Watch it for about 45 min..  ((anonymous report));2019-07-06 02:00:00;45 minutes;Light in the sky moving from south to north with weird up and down movements.  Watch it for about 45 min & then light faded away. I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn’t fall back asleep so I was just staring out my window.  There was what I thought was a plane that was very far away or a star because when I first saw it it was blinking kind of like a plane or a distant star would.  But I realized that it was moving but it wasn’t moving like a plane at all which is what caused me to continue watching it.  Eventually the light stopped blinking and just stayed lit.  The movements seemed to be very random.  The best way I can describe it is that it was moving very slowly from the south to the north and it would randomly make sudden up and down movements.  Then after watching it for about 45 minutes the objects light all of a sudden faded very fast and it was gone.;47.6959;-117.1078

I noticed there were 4 to 5 stars next to the moon that were brighter than the others, they began to move around very fast causing my vision to feel blurred. I asked my brother and boyfriend if they saw the moving lights, they both agreed they were seeing them also.  Then more bright lights came from the right side of the moon and our property line and joined the other lights, they all moved into a straight line, evenly spaced apart and began moving quickly towards our house, I began recording with my phone and counting the lights. I counted 10 moving lights, then they faded away into nothing. My recording shows lights but not like they were in person.  About 20 minutes later 3 more bright lights in a different part of the sky showed up out of nowhere over our horse pasture. They moved into a line evenly spaced apart like the others and flew into a different direction and faded away.  Maybe 15 to 20 minutes after that one more bright like came into the sky out of nowhere and moved towards our house again, a star was in the way and the bright moving light moved around the star then back on its straight course.  The cloud cover was very thick last night but only around our property and the surround areas. The bright moving lights looked just like stars but much brighter and moved at a fast rate. After all 3 events took place we heard a large helicopter in the area.;47.6959;-117.1078
