On Saturday October 5th 2007 I was sitting on my outdoor porch which faces north listening to my radio while exercising. All of a sudden all the power went off in my house and in the surrounding area. This happens once or twice a year in this area called the Wenas Valley which is just north of Selah, Washington. I continued what I was doing for about another 10-15 minutes until I noticed a really bright shinning object came straight down out of the clouds. It was about a mile away from me just below the mountain range. It stopped and hovered silently for about 60 seconds and then moved west about ¼ of a mile and stopped again and just hovered. Then it came towards me about ¼ of a mile and stopped again. It stayed there about 30 seconds and then shot straight up back into the clouds. This all happened around 2PM in the afternoon on a overcast day where it had been raining about an hour I called 911 to report this and to also see if anyone else had turned in a similar report. Know one had, but the operator said she would call me back if anyone else did. After that I called the power company to report the outage and know one had reported it yet. About 15 minutes later my power came back on. I told a few people about this and they advised me to say no more. I haven’t for about 4 months now and due to watching all the reports about others seeing similar things around the country I decided to report mine here.;46.6763999999999;-120.5351
