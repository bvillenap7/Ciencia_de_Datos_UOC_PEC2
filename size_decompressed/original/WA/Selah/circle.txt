stars on parade?;2006-11-04 22:30:00;20 min;stars on parade? On Saturday evening my daughter asked me to come out of the house and look at the sky.  She pointed out what looked like stars.  Looking closely I noticed they were in formation.  A line of 5 across and behind each one was a long and seemingly endless trail of lights. They were spaced out evenly. They were using the clouds to hide behind.  On occasion one would break out of formation, fly in a circle around another one and then return to its original place. Some would fly and join in a triangular formation. As far as I know we did not have a meteor shower and stars do not behave this way. There were two that were stationary and waited for the end of the group. They left thier position and joined the group as they finished flying over.  I think they were like guides or escorts. I have no idea what all of this was.  It was very disturbing to me as well as my children.;46.6763999999999;-120.5351
