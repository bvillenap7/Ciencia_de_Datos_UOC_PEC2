ORANGE LIGHT OVER FIRING CENTER RD, APPEARED TWICE;2017-04-22 23:33:00;90 seconds;ORANGE LIGHT OVER FIRING CENTER RD, APPEARED TWICE Saw a bright orange light once on the way to Selah while on the freeway, and then when we came home we saw what we thought to be the same light, in the same general spot (direction was NE, not too far from the Training Base) and we watched it for about a minute and a half before it disappeared after remaining stationary.  It was too bright and too high up to be a street light, and we noticed that a nearby dog began to bark when it appeared, then ceased barking around the same time it disappeared.;46.6763999999999;-120.5351
