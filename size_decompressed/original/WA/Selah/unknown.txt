On Sunday June 10th at approximately 9:30 p.m. I saw six large lights in the sky.  I was heading northbound on I-82, about 5 miles outside of Selah, WA in Yakima County.  The lights were too large to be from a plane, and they were not moving at all.  They appeared to be up too high to be attached to the ground.  These lights were pretty close together which also ruled out the possiblity of them being planes as well.  They were stationary the entire time that I saw them.  The color was a white-yellow color very similar to normal car headlights.  I did not notice any particular shape that these lights formed. They were very brigt for about 2 minutes, and one by one they began to fade out without moving during this process.  After a few seconds from the time they began fading, they were completely gone.  I know that the other cars on I-82 at this location and time couldn't have missed noticing these lights.  They were much too bright, and were basically in the middle of nowhere.;46.6763999999999;-120.5351
Bluish-green light with smaller red light makes a zigzagging pattern over Selah, WA, stopping entirely a few times.;2013-07-30 21:30:00;10 minutes;Bluish-green light with smaller red light makes a zigzagging pattern over Selah, WA, stopping entirely a few times. I was dropping my husband off at work when we saw a greenish-blue light with a smaller red light rise fairly fast from the horizon, at first my husband insisted it was a plane coming toward us and that it appeared to be going straight up because of that, however, soon the thing stopped entirely and changed direction.  The lighted object first went left for a while, stopped again, then turned right, stopped again, and eventually went right over the top of us.  From there it stopped again, and there was no additional noise even though it appeared to be fairly close, it then went away from us in that same odd pattern, going one way, stopping, then going another way. It wasnâ€™t long before it just decided to take off I guess, and went off slowly away from Selah and disappeared behind some trees going away from Yakima/Selah area.  I tried to follow it but it was just gone.  The whole thing lasted around ten minutes or so.;46.6763999999999;-120.5351
