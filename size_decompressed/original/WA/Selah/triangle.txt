Four UFO's spotted driving I-90, they were fast moving and above the clouds.   When coming through the Selah gap I saw a white light that seemed to be strobing.  It stayed in the same place as far as I could see.  When I began my drive up Fremont ave. the craft was only about 100 feet above the road and began to move counterclockwise, as it traveled to the south east relatively slowly at about 150 mph.  And I lost sight of it as it went back over the Selah gap.;46.6763999999999;-120.5351

On 7-15-15 my girlfriend and I saw a triangular craft flying across the sky in Selah, WA.  I noticed it but didn't think anything of it until I heard tonight's episode of Coast To Coast AM and one of the news guests in the first segment mentioned a strange craft was noticed over Yakima, Washington 2 days ago.  I was a witness to that sighting.;46.6763999999999;-120.5351
