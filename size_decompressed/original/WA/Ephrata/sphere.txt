Brilliant White Orb of Light, Dim Red/Orange Orb seen on edge of electrical storm;2007-06-04 20:00:00;4-5sec/1min;Brilliant White Orb of Light, Dim Red/Orange Orb seen on edge of electrical storm I was camping near a creek in the desert of Washington, sitting near my small fire facing roughly east, while an intense electrical storm provided a light show to the north-northeast.  With darkness nearing, the storm was slowly drifting my way. I suddenly caught a movement to my left, and looked just as an extremely bright white orb came cruising in from the SW, approaching the storm.  It moved fast, but began to slow down as it approached the storm.  As soon as I thought it had stopped, it moved north along the western edge of the storm IN AN ARC, taking about two or three seconds to cover at least 5 miles.  Then, as soon as it looked like it had stopped, it moved away at an extremely high rate of speed.  It stunned me because of how the brightness was so much more intense than any plane lighting I’ve seen before, then stunned me by how it moved.  Wow.  But that wasn’t all. While I could still see stars overhead of me (the storm hadn’t blocked them out yet), a smaller, dim orange/red orb just appeared beneath the high crest of the creeping cel.  It was like a light had just come on.  The thing was, it just hovered there for a good minute, motionless, maybe a couple thousand feet up and a mile to my NE.  The storm moved over and around it, so I finally lost sight of it. Incidentally, a lot of planes appeared in the area immediately after I lost sight of the last object, and I could later see a chopper flying around shining a spotlight up into the clouds!  Quite an unexpected treat.  The first light in particular, though, made me feel very uncomfortable.  It was only a little closer and lower than the second one, and it didn’t move, nor look, like anything I’ve seen before.;47.2771;-119.5336
