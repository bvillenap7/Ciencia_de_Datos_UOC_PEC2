Five bright orange, round UFO east of Oak Harbor, WA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Case solved by local investigator.  Chinese lanterns.  PD));2011-05-27 22:20:00;10 minutes;Five bright orange, round UFO east of Oak Harbor, Washinton I stepped outside about 10:30 PM pacific daylight time to see if there were any auroras, which potentially should have been in the area per spaceweather,com.  I immediately I saw the first object when I stepped out my door. I called my neighbor when I first saw the object to confirm what I was seeing, but as we were on the phone, it reached a spot in the sky almost directly east of me, hesitated, blinked a couple times and faded away.  (The sky was cloudy, but it did not seem like the disappearance was due to clouds.)   As we were on the phone, as I was expressing my disappointment that the neighbor missed it, another came over the horizon and did exactly the same thing, disappearing at the same spot after blinking a couple times.  My neighbor did see this one, and all later objects.  In all, when we were on the phone, my neighbor saw four, I saw five total, spaced about two to three minutes apart.   Each came from the north, heading south south east.  Each one was round, and very bright orange.  There was no flashing.  They were approximately 40 degrees above the horizon to the east.  Each was identical, and about four to five times brighter than a planet, if not more.  When I first spotted each, it was moving very fast, but slowed down as it reached the exact same spot where each blinked and disappeared.    Each object had the same trajectory and speed before fading away.  I could attribute the slowing and disappearance to turning and heading directly east, but I thought it odd that each disappeared in exactly the same way despite being seen over at least 10 minutes when the cloud cover would have changed.  I did grab my binoculars to look at each one and could see no distinguishing features, just large, round,and bright orange.  Unfortunately I had loaned my neighbor's kid my camera for a photography class so I could get no images.;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
Bright light coming from sky in Oak Harbor with loud rumbling sound that shook my bed.;2017-01-17 17:26:00;20 seconds;Bright light coming from sky in Oak Harbor with loud rumbling sound that shook my bed. It was about 17:26 and I was laying on my bed playing my virtual reality, when I heard a loud rumbling sound (sounded a lot like bass) that shook my bed.   I looked outside to see a bright light about the size of a car.  It was emitting a bright light and a haze around the circular object.  Then it disappeared over the trees. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, I am sincerely sorry for such the late response. For some reason this email ended up in my junk mail. No, I did not get a photo of it, but I did see it pretty clearly for about 3 or so seconds, before it moved over the treeline.  All I could see though, I put in the form.  It was about the size of a car. This is a serious report, not a hoax. Also, I accidentally said I saw it on the 13th, but I actually saw it on the 17th.
