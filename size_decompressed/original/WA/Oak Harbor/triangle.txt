No noise, very low flying, and a triangular shape.;2018-02-13 20:30:00;5 minutes;No noise, very low flying, and a triangular shape. I was driving north on I-20 at about 8:30-9pm. When i noticed a large Triangular craft that seemed to make no noise while flying through the sky.  Theres a naval base on Whidbey Island, so crafts are not unusual although it was flying much lower than anything I have seen before. There were two almost spot light looking lights coming off the bottom.  I only saw it for about 2 minutes, and it didnt make any extremely strange maneuver while i watched it.;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
