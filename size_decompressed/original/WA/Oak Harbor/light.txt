I saw a red light that seemed some distance from me to the east making very strange (impossible for known aircraft) movements.;1999-08-22 01:00:00;3 hours;I saw a red light that seemed some distance from me to the east making very strange (impossible for known aircraft) movements. Me and my girlfreind were sitting on the east beach of Deception Pass state park. While we were sitting their I noticed a red light above the hills on the other side of the water. (the other side is probably 1/2 - 3/4 of a mile  away) I couldn't give a descent distance reading, but It looked to be a ways of (5-10 miles). I was looking at it at probably a 20 degree angle so it would have been pretty high above the ground (1000 feet?) I would have thought it was some natural occurance (radio antenna light, plane, etc) except for that it was moving back and forth and making some very random movements (small loops, stopping quickly and then going the other way.) If it was as far away as a felt it was it would have been moving at least a mile back and forth in these movements. It would have done this in about 3-4 seconds. I never saw the object disappear and it was their when I left at about 3:40 in the morning. For all I know it could be something natural and I wouldn't have reported it except for the odd movements. If you happen to have any investigators up in oak harbor here's some precise information to my location. I was on the east shoreline (the beach you can see from the bridge) of the beach, about a hundred yards down from some large rock formations. Right below where the object was their was a flashing light/lighthouse (or something similar) something on the hill across from where we were. If you were to sit in the spot and look at the lighthouse then look up above the hill a degree or two that's were the object was.;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
Lights on Whidbey Island;2001-08-25 23:59:00;30 minutes;Lights on Whidbey Island Upon returning home from the movies around midnight I got out of the car and saw approximately 10 or so lights blinking at different rates of speed one at a time.  Then a light from the bottom circled around the other lights leaving a trail of somesort and returning to its original position.  My boyfriend and I woke up his family and we all watched this go on for about 30 minutes.  We turned on the radio to see if anybody else might be watching it too.  Just curious if anybody had any ideas as to what this might have been. ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain whether the incident occurred on the night of 25AU01, or 24AU01.

Object fading out of sky, traveling south;2006-07-11 02:40:00;15 seconds;Object fading out of sky, traveling south I was taking out my garbage just now when it happened.  It's a full moon tonight and I was looking at the sky when I noticed a really bright star, seemed out of place. I watched it and I could tell it was moving, so I thought it might be an aircraft, maybe an EA-6B or a P-3, but I realized there was no noise.  Then it got really bright and and faded away into nothing.  Scared me pretty bad.  Object was heading  south when it went out.

Fast moving object flying over Oak Harbor, WA;2011-07-16 23:30:00;1-2 MINUTES;Fast moving object flying over Oak Harbor WA I was outside at 2330 on Saturday 16 JUL 2011.  I was just sky watching.   I noticed a few small palnes in the area and they were all flying under the clouds and their srobe light were flashing.  Then I noticed a light traveling from SW to NE at a high rate of speed.  I cannot say what the altitude was, but it was flying above the clouds.  It continued on the same path until it I could not see it anymore because of the clouds.  I have seen satellites before and it did not look like a satellite.  It was not a meteor either.  It was not reflecting the sun. The light was coming from the craft.  It was a solid white light.  There were not flashing lights.  This sighting was near NAS Whidbey Island.  There were no military aircraft in the air that night.  I will continue to observe the smae area. I had a similar sighting north of Washington DC in 1996 or 97.;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
Lights possibly in orbit entering the atmosphere;2021-08-11 22:10:00;45 seconds;Lights possibly in orbit entering the atmosphere Two bright lights appeared at an extremely high altitude at about 20 degrees above the horizon south of my position and moved in a northern direction in line with each other for approximately 30 seconds. There were no strobes or anti collision lights that would indicate an aircraft. After a few seconds the lead light began to fade followed by the trailing light. A moment after they vanished there was a bright flash about three degrees below where the lights had been.;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
