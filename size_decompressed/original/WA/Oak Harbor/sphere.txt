Ball of light shadowing an airliner;2011-06-16 17:00:00;30 sec;Ball of light shadowing an airliner Myself and neighbor were looking to the east and saw, what appeared to be a civilian airliner flying in a southerly direction.  Just above the vertical stabilizer was a small ball of light.  At first, I thought maybe there was a special device attached to the tail.  It then fell in behind the aircraft, then went under the middle of the fuselage, went above the middle fuselage.  Just before the aircraft went behind the trees, the little ball of light went above,and just forward of the aircraft.  Being a 24 year veteran of Naval Aviation, I found this very strange.  I reported the sighting to the Operations Duty officer at NAS Whidbey Island, which is only a mile or so from the house.;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
