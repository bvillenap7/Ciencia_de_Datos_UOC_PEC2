30 Semi  bright lights in early morning sky flying in trail formation from west to east.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-08-13 03:55:00;45-60 seconds;30 Semi  bright lights in early morning sky flying in trail formation from west to east. 30 oval lights flying in 2 abreast trail formation.  Objects observed flying at a speed and altitude similar to what would be seen watching the ISS flying at 45 degrees above the horizon. Observation was pure luck. I had been watching the meteorite shower for maybe 25 minutes when I started following a dull bright satellite across the sky from the south to the north, it flew almost directly overhead my location, as I watched it descending in the northern sky it was intersected by the path of the other objects flying from west to east;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
