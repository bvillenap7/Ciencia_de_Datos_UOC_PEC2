I was standing in my back yard looking toward the ground.  Heard a familiar sound like a deep hollow thrust of a propane torch-down torch. Looked up at approximately 1 to 1.5 miles away and saw a black cylinder approximately 15 to 20+ feet long with dome, flying lower than the tree line (ridge) in the background.  It was heading east slow moving guessing travel 10 to 15 mph.  Then as it was slowly turning north I saw reflective silver edge... like window facing downward toward earth.  Looking at the back end was glowing flame at outer edge with center being dark, it began climbing.  As I continued hearing thrust sound I ran into the house to get my camera.  That took 40 seconds. I ran to the end of my property and began video.  By this time it was approximately 3 miles away and could see thrust still... then fading.  On my digital camera it appears tiny and focused.  With a magnifying glass you can see flame as it upturned then slowly the thrust died down.   The cylinder pointed upward and floated drifting with a wobble at the base, like a swaying motion.  Disappeared into the clouds.  I drew a picture and made a model of it just to make sense of it.;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
