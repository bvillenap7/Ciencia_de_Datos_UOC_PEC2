alien in the woods;1973-06-01 03:00:00;30 seconds;alien in the woods I was seven years old. Lived on Whidbey  Island.  My brother and I used to play in the woods right behind the elementary school (Oak Harbor Elementary). On this particular day it was hot and  as we were playing army I lost sight of my brother. So I started running while looking for him. I remember as I was running I felt like an electrical charge, all of my hair was standing up on my arms and my ears felt funny.  Almost like when you are up high in altitude. I looked to my left and I saw a 12 to 13 inch high humanoid running beside me on a log keeping up, and it turned its head and looked at me. The most horrifying thing was when it smiled. It had a really big mouth with a lot of teeth. It might have been small but I will never forget the terror I felt. I immediately stopped and turned to run in the opposite direction when I felt something extremely cold, Large, square, hit my back and sent me flying about 10 feet through the air. It knocked me out. When I woke up, I went home and complained to my dad about my back. I was bruised with a black and blue square mark about half the size of my back. I never told my dad how I got the bruise, but it was so traumatic that to this day I will not go to far into the woods by myself. I always have to be able to see a clear path to my car. I have never gone back to those woods on Whidbey Island. I hope this helps in your quest for knowledge. I do believe something is there. Thank you for your time.

Bright light over bay (Oak Harbor, WA);2006-08-12 21:50:00;10 min;Bright light over bay (Oak Harbor, WA) It appeared first as a large, bright, yellowish light hovering over the bay.  It seemed to be fairly close (10 miles or so).  I went in to get my wife who was impressed immediately.  We watched for a few minutes and then what we both described as a shooting star passed over our heads.  We then went in to get our son and when we came back outside the large bright light was further away and moving!  It traveled ESE and then pretty much due east until it left our eyesight.;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
