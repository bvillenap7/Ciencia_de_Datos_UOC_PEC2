Possible military test craft in Oak Harbor, Washington.;1986-09-01 15:00:00;15 seconds;Possible military test craft in Oak Harbor, Washington. I was driving and saw and oddly shaped aircraft.  It left no trail.  I could not tell whether it made any noise because I was driving a very noisy car at the time.  If you looked at the craft from the bottom, it appeared to be shaped a bit like a chevron.  As it flew away and I saw it from behind, its appeared to be curved.  It was one solid body, somewhat like the Stealth, except the wings (if you can call them that) were curved downward.  I doubt it was an alien craft because it was flying very low and there was a military base close by.  But it was certainly unlike anything I'd seen before or since.

It appeared to have atleast 3 lights. Blue and Red and Green light was clearly seen from the naked eye.  I used a telescope to examine and 4 lights were clear to seperate maybe more that were unseperated clearly. The lights seemed to go off in a circular pattern.  Purple, Green, Red, Blue. in what order of the colors i cannot say. !0 minutes later it seemed that it had leveled flat and a row of lights could be seen through the telescope.  After that i witnessed it looking as if it was doing ariel flips but not moving in any direction.  If it is a satalight i have never seen one this clearly that i can see purple and greens or the red light so clearly from the naked eye.
