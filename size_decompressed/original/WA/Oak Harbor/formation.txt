Slow moving formation of lights.  Looked like a combination between a massive freight train and a comet.  ((Falcon 9 re-entry??));2021-03-25 21:00:00;1 min;Slow moving formation of lights.  Looked like a combination between a massive freight train and a comet. It looked like a combination of a very slow moving comet and a long freight train with dotted windows lit up. It moved through the sky from west to east and crossed over Heller Road around 9pm.  The front was the brightest and had the most lit up objects but there were other bright lights scattered in the middle and towards the back.  The light trailed off behind each bright light.  My son thought it was a one of the big navy carrier planes, but it didnâ€™t make any sound and was a lot bigger/longer and looked way different to him when his eyes adjusted to the image.  He saw it more as a formation of bright, round lights. I also thought it was a navy carrier plane since they fly overhead here all the time but when I lifted his window shades I could tell that it was something very different.  It was massive and slow moving.  I have never seen anything like that before.  A truck driving down Heller Road slowed to a stop as it passed over head.  We assume he or s! he saw it too.;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
