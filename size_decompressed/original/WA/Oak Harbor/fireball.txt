balls of light over Puget  Sound;2009-12-28 18:00:00;5 mins;balls of light over Puget  Sound Looking out of the harbor towards South Whidbey Island I first saw 1 ball of light on the horizon.  I watched for a a min. to see if it was a plane.  It would grow brighter and then almost go away. It would flicker red and white and different colors.  After the first one I started seeing more along the horizon. same characteristics same size. lasted about 5 mins and they went away.   Being close to a naval station I know the differences in planes.   This was odd but maybe just flares. I just wanted to share and find an answer thank you;48.3160339622643;-122.64096509434
