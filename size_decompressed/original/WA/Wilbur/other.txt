A string of lights in the sky moving in the same direction at about the same distance apart.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-26 20:30:00;10;A string of lights in the sky moving in the same direction at about the same distance apart While looking at the night sky, I noticed a small light moving across the sky followed by about nine more lights moving at what appeared to be at the same speed and keeping the same distance from one another. They weren’t blinking or brighter than the next one. I watched them all move in a northeastern direction from where I was located. (SpaceX satellites?) I tried to get a picture from my phone but it wasn’t powerful enough to capture any of the lights.;47.7421;-118.7097
