I saw a blue streak moving across the sky.;2017-04-07 22:25:00;2 seconds;I saw a blue streak moving across the sky. I live approximately 15 miles North of Omak, Washington (State), and about 25 minutes south of the Canadian border.  At precisely 10:25 p.m. on April 7, 2017 - 13 miles north of Riverside, Washington, I was driving home (north) on Hwy. 97 when a blue streak of light went across the sky from right to left (east to west or NE to SW).   It moved from 360 degrees north to approximately 300 degrees in two seconds.  It would have been approximately 1/16 or smaller of the size of the moon.  The head of the streak was round with the blue streak following and being parallel & connected to the round ball - example (lollipop).  It was very low within the earth atmosphere and could have been just inside the border of British Columbia, Canada.   Two of Okanogan County sheriff vehicles just passed me seconds before the streak appeared and so I am not sure if they noticed what my wife and I witnessed.   If others saw what we saw, I would appreciate them filling out a report thereby, verifying this event. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the individual who submitted this report, and we found him to be both eloquent, and serious-minded, in his description of his sighting.  We suspect he is a very good, and very reliable, witness.  PD));48.4876;-119.5803
