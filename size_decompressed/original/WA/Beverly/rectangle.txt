Two square flat lights/Beverly, Washington;2011-03-18 00:40:00;3-4 min;Two square flat lights/Beverly, Washington I saw two stationary square shaped flat bright lights about 30-50 feet apart and approximately 500 feet above the ground over the columbia river.  The lights I spotted were near Beverly, Washington just south of the Wanapum Dam a mile or so.  The time of the sighting was 12:40 am, on March 18,2011.  I watched the lights for 3 minutes or so and then the lights appeared to just fade out one at a time.  Did anyone else see this?;46.8499;-119.9175
