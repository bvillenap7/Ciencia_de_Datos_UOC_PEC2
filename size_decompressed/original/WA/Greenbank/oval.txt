I was driving home and spotted a really bright (star?) in the sky. Pretty dark out and no city lights around.  The shape got longer until it looked like a stretched long oval shape.  I kept driving and then saw that there were now red lights (3) extending off of the right of the light and then 2 small blue lights formed behind the red lights.;48.1016;-122.569
