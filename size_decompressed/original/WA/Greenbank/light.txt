bright white light moving horizontally and vertically over Puget Sound;2011-02-01 20:00:00;5 minutes;bright white light moving horizontally and vertically over Puget Sound Last night, February 1, 2011, I was standing outside my Greenbank, WA, home and looking out over puget sound.   What at first appeared to be just a motionless star began moving vertically and horizontally in a very rapid motion.  Quite erratic - there was no discernible method to its movements.  It was around 8pm and I watched it for about five minutes.  The bright light eventually came to a stop for a minute, once again resembling a star, so I returned inside.;48.1016;-122.569
