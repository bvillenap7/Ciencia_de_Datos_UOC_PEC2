6/3/03 northern Washington, erratic circular light moving across the sky;2003-06-03 23:00:00;2 minutes;6/3/03 northern Washington, erratic circular light moving across the sky I was at Lake Chopaka on a fishing trip.  There were no man made lights except some distant campers.  A circular colored light ( I am red-green color blind and the color is hard for me to discern, but it was not white, more a faint red or green), came over the horizon moving in a wobbly fashion but basically in a linear trachectory.  It was about 15 to 20 times bigger than a star. The unusual aspects were the size and the unusual movement.  The amplitude of the movement was probably 2 to 3 times the diameter of the object, but it had no discernable regular frequency.It moved from west to east.  There was no noise of an aircraft.  Before crossing the next horizon the light got smaller then disappeared in about a 5 second span.  I cannot think of anything that moves in this manner.  I suppose if it was high enough it could have been reflecting light from the sun as I was far enough north that it had only been completely dark for about 30 minutes.;48.3481;-119.601
