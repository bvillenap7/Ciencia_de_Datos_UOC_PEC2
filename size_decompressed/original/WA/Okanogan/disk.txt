Silver disk sighted hovering &  moving slowly 0.5-1.0 mile above the ground in the area of Okanogan, WA.;1991-06-25 12:30:00;2-3 Minutes;Silver disk sighted hovering &  moving slowly 0.5-1.0 mile above the ground in the area of Okanogan, WA. Witness advises he was 13 YOA at the time of the sighting and was in the company of a friend named Dale of the same age. They were working in an orchard above Okanogan, WA on a sunny, cloudless day around the end of July in 1991 and had just stopped for lunch when they observed a silver object hovering silently in the sky above the hills that border Okanogan city to the east. The witness states the silver object shined brightly in reflected sunlight and appeared to be hovering at a height of between a half a mile and a mile above the ground at a distance of about a mile or so from them.  At that distance, it appeared about a half an inch in diameter to the observers.   He says that the object seemed to shimmer in the sun like a mirage in the desert and that it was spinning on an axis like a coin one might spin on a table top.  Because of this movement, it was difficult to tell if the outline of the object was a disk or triangle.  After 2-3 minutes, the object moved north and then shot straight up very quickly and disappeared from sight. END OF REPORT.
