My daughter stepped outside onto our back deck to smoke a cigarette at approximately 1720 hours on August 31, 2012.  She called to me and said, Mom, what is that?  Come here! I ran out back and looked up.  In between the tall fir trees, there was a glowing orange rectangular object moving through the sky heading north.   It started heading out over our house, so we both ran through the house to the front yard.  It had now changed direction and was heading east.  I told my daughter to go get her brother, and just as they came out of the house, the object just evaporated.   There were only a few clouds  it was clear where it had been.   Also, the moon was unusually large and was in the same direction that the object was travelling.;46.921;-122.5938
