Saw this flickering light moving around the moon.  cannot say the shape of it but the lights were changing colors.  Yellow, red, blue.  it moved quickly...jumping around left right up down...with no sound.  I watched it for about 30 minutes and then went inside to get my camera.  Came back out side and took some video.  Went back inside and woke my husband up to look at it.  Neither of use could figure out what it was.  kept going outside every once in awhile and it was still there.  My son came home from work about 2300 approx and he too came outside to watch it.  After awhile we went inside.  not sure how long it was there but we observed it for approx 3 hours.;46.921;-122.5938

As it got closer, it stopped, did a zig-zag move, and then continued Northbound for a minute, growing more clear yet so far away.  Sudden stop and sharp right turn, west-northwest.  I shined a strong flashlight to see if it was a drone, but it was too far.;46.921;-122.5938
