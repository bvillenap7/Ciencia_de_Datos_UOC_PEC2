There are no street lights and the road is surrounded by forest. On a side note half of yelm (the forest) is owned by the military.. Fort Lewis. So nathan and I were rocking out to the music and all of sudden I see this aircraft hoovering above the trees right beside the highway. The aircraft was traingular and had two square lights at the bottom and there was no cockpit in sight. It was thick and it had a light at every corner. We were driving by it slowly but some dumbass was on our ass looking at the thing too, we almost get in a car accident. We manage to recover and just drive away. I kept looking at the aircraft trying to see if I could find any of resemblance to our aircrafts. The oddest thing was that it hoovered and there was no sound.;46.921;-122.5938
silver triangle shape sighting in Yelm WA;2009-08-05 14:05:00;35 sec;silver triangle shape sighting in Yelm WA The craft was triangle and silver in color and was the size of dime in the sky at first.  Then it proceeded to get larger and larger until it was the size of maybe an orange relative to the sun.  It made no noise.  It did not spin around it just stayed in its original shape and came perpendicular to the earths surface very fast.  It took off straight up just as it had come down.  It was gone from eye sight within about a second.  I was able to see it for maybe 35 sec. from the start to finish of the sighting.  The sighting took place in Yelm, WA Thurston county.  Looking toward the northeast sky.  I have never seen anything like it, it was very interesting but at the same time scary.

Shape, speed, level movement, No sound. and disapeared.;2010-10-29 21:11:00;15 seconds;Shape, speed, level movement,  No sound. and disapeared. I've always admired the stars especially in Washington State during these raining seasons, it was partly cloudy and going about back for a cigarett, looking southwest from my stoop, a dimly lit, silent, craft in the shape of a triangle, but had several lights in between moving along farely fast about 700-1000 feet off the ground, traveling south to southeast.  The lights seem to be round in shape, white to light silver in color but definatley outlined the shap of a triangle. I said to myself three times, What the heck is that?   After seingin it disappear, I opened the door and asked my wife, what time is it?   I then came in after a few minutes, probably 12-15, of trying to see if the craft was going to return on a another path, but it did not.   I then told my wife and two boys my experience.;46.921;-122.5938
4 Triangular craft, lit up by lights, seen in sky, remained stationary and I never saw them depart.;2015-07-18 23:00:00;Ongoing;4 Triangular craft, lit up by lights, seen in sky, remained stationary and I never saw them depart. I looked into the sky, and immediately I noticed blinking lights.  There is a direct flight path for commercial jets and for military aircraft over my house, so I am always careful to be sure of what I am seeing.   Tonight I stared and rubbed my eyes, and I looked around, and I KNOW what I saw was not normal.  I saw, at first, two. I looked around and saw another and one more!  They were stationary and triangular shaped.  The triangular form was highlighted by the lights that were all around it.  To top it off, there seemed to be a brighter, straight line of lights going from the point of the triangle, down one side, and through the bottom straight edge of it.  I stared for awhile, then went to Facebook to see if anyone else saw it.  Most people were off FB for the night, but one coworker was still there, so she decided to look, too.  She couldn't believe it.  She saw what I saw and she saw just as many!   We still do not know what they are, and they are still there as I! go to bed.;46.921;-122.5938
