I observed what appeared to be a large disk 500'above treetop level. White round lights around craft shining down. Strange blue ring of lights below. I observed this for what seemed like forver. Another car stopped and two other people about a quarter of a mile down the road stopped and watched this. I saw it pass quietly over some trees and a road. It was traveling about 20mph. It was very quiet. I never talked to other witnesses and don't have any pictures.;46.921;-122.5938
