APPEARED;2002-09-13 09:40:00;@ 10 MINS;A TOTAL OF FIVE OBJECTS SPREAD OUT (THOUGH NOT EQUALLY SPACED) IN A STAGGERED LINE MOVING VERY SLOWLY FROM THE NORTH TO SOUTH. APPEARED TO BE VERY HIGH UP SO WE COULDN'T DISTINGUISH THE SHAPE, TWO OF THE FIVE SEEMED TO HAVE A RED-ORANGE COLOR, THE REST SILVER. WHILE THE OBJECTS MOVED ACROSS THE SKY, TWO MILITARY JETS FLEW OVERHEAD FROM @ SOUTH-EAST TO NORTH-WEST, ONE BEHIND THE OTHER. THESE OBJECTS SEEMED TO BE HIGHER THEN THE JETS, WHICH OF COURSE WOULD MAKE THEM LARGER THAN A PARTY BALLOON. SURE WISH I COULD HAVE SEEN THEM THROUGH BINOCULARS!

The object;2006-10-11 11:29:00;a few minutes;I noticed a very white tail behind an object traveling north in the southern sky. It appeared to be very high and far away. The object I could not make out, but the white tail showed up clearly against the blue sky and was perhaps 5 times as long as it was wide. The most notable feature was that the white tail did not trail out into a vapor cloud like a contrail behind a plane. It ended sharply, without a residual mark in the sky. After watching it for a couple of minutes, the white tail disappeared. For a few more seconds, I could see a tiny bright dot with the same path that looked like sunlight reflecting off of metal, then I could not see anything there at all. A student on campus saw it at the same time I did.  I would like to know just what it was.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Teeny tiny bright light seen zig zagging across night sky;2008-12-10 18:00:00;5 minutes;Teeny tiny bright light seen zig zagging across night sky Teeny tiny bright light....a star perhaps?   BUT it glided across the sky as if it were a star, then it zig zagged back up and across where it originated and beyond.   I stopped watching when it slowed down and I had a crook in my neck from gazing upward for so long.   Unidentified...... what?;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
small fire ball moving at very slow speed;2011-01-28 22:16:00;45sec;small fire ball moving at very slow speed On 10/28/2011 at 10.15 pm my wife and I were walking our dogs and we heard a low flying jet move east to west at high speed.  This caused us to gaze up towards the sky  Within 5 seconds we saw what seemed like a fireball moving in the same direction.   We were looking at the object which seemed to be approximately 50 yards to our left and less than 1000 feet elevation.  The object was moving very slow and inconsistent in the direction.  It remained in our sight for about 25 seconds and then got dimmer and higher and then quickly disappeared  It was not a helicopter and not a normal flying aircraft because it moved so slow.  I thought I might be a parachute flare.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929

Single amber light, at first thought to be Mars but in the wrong position.  Shone very brightly then winked out over several seconds.

Pig screams and noises?;2021-02-04 03:30:00;2 hours;Pig screams and noises? Hello I had a very disturbing experience last night. I was laying in my bed trying to fall asleep, but then I suddenly heard this big scream like something was dying. At first I thought it was nothing, but then I went into the bathroom and started to hear pig noises that were scratching and digging at something. I got a recording of the noises, I'll send them over to you. It sounded like a pig can out of no where and was walking around as I could hear breaking branches. Give it a listen? None of my neighbors have farm animals. I really don't know what that thing was. ((NUFOC Note:  We hear nothin in the clip.  PD));47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
