Life's storys the way i kinda remember it.;1970-06-01 23:30:00;20 minutes;life's storys the way i kinda remember it back in 1970's not sure the date I had gotten off of work 11 pm I was going to see my great aunt  she was in old folks hospital.  It was closed, so I started to go home in Shoreline, WA. I pulled out of parking lot I saw across hwy. 99 above a Gulf gas station at a angle above the roof about 10 ft. above a round disk with 4= people like about 4 ft. tall, 3 in blue, one in white I am guessing the boss the 3 were working on the deck of ship I watched for about 15 minutes or so than went to Owl tav.  had a beer told bar tender about it a few years later almost the same spot above McCaliater motor cycle shop, I saw another disk fly over cycle shop & go in to the woods after that I lost it I saw that one for about 30 seconds  I don't know the time don't know why I was there also back in 1964 about 5 miles north of there at Lake Stickny it was common to see ufo's almost every day I was in hi school a lot of kids would go there  to look for them.  I only went there once I took a picture of it with a polaroid camera I had the picture of it for years.  years later I fell in to the water it got wet it wrecked the picture I think I tossed it after it dryed out so I seen a total of 3 ufo's in my life time.  the first time I went to air force was going to tell them about it a guy there said I would not do that they will send some one out to you make you fill out your lifes history than call you a nut. So I did not do anything. years after that I think they would come in to my room take me away some place put me in with so young girl with long hair blonde kind of looked like Norway girl I am not quite sure but I think we had sex things would get a little fuzzy I would find myself back at home in bed I thought I had a dream  that would happen about every 3 years. guessing.  that's why I thought it mite be a dream I don't know if I could call it a ufo incounter or not it stopped happing after I got married I don't remember any. I am to old for them to want me any more. any way that's my story's;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Two lights moving rapidly, changing distance from each other and one disappearing & reappearing.;2003-07-29 22:45:00;2-3 minutes;Two lights moving rapidly, changing distance from each other and one disappearing & reappearing. As I sat on my deck I saw what I thought were 2 lights on an airplane, they were accross from each other flying accross the sky. They were not shooting stars. One kept disappearing then reappearing. As I watched, one went behind the other then their distance doubled. They were steady lights, white in color. Except for the one that continued to disappear and re-appear. The were as though one chasing the other. I lost sight as they went past the building. They looked the size of the stars visible in the sky but moved faster than an airplane does. I later saw an airplane and realized that they flew much higher and that a plane has blinking and solid lights. This was definately an anomali I have never witnessed before. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed satellites moving across the night sky.  The intermittent light may have been a rocket shell, tumbling as it moved in orbit around the Earth.

Black orb dissapeared into clouds heading north along HWY 99 Lynnwood WA;2005-11-06 22:30:00;10 seconds;Black orb dissapeared into clouds heading north along HWY 99 Lynnwood, WA I just stepped out of my car and as always I look to the sky and analyze the weather but I happened to see a black orb quickly flying below the clouds and it entered the clouds after about 10 seconds.  It could be seen a little through the clouds but just dissapeared.  The object was heading north along Aurora Avenue/HWY 99.  I had heard a type of sound as if blowing air over the top of an empty bottle but it dissapeared when the object was above the clouds.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Red circle shape- high up hovering around- turned black then took off fast!;2010-07-04 22:00:00;1 min 20 sec;Red circle shape- high up hovering around- turned black then took off fast!   Watching fireworks, seen a red light in the shape of a circle in the sky- WAY HIGH UP. Very red- havered for about 45 seconds then it started flying.  Once it started flying it became black but you could still see it.  We ran to follow it and watched as it moved away going higher up in the air flying away fast.  It then stopped again hovered for about 5 seconds, made a sharp left turn and took off. About 30 minutes later it happened again and did the exact same thing!;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Red light over Lynnwood, Washington during Perseid meteor shower.;2010-08-13 03:30:00;1 minute;Red light over Lynnwood, Washington during Perseid meteor shower. The night was clear, affording optimal viewing for the Perseid meteor shower, so I took advantage and watched for them. At about 3:30 a.m., I noticed a red dot moving roughly from west to east across the night sky.   It seemed to be quite high in the sky, was moving at an incredible rate of speed, and was completely silent. It crossed my field of visibility in less than a minute's time. This was no airplane and it certainly was not a meteor.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Bright white light over Lynnwood, WA, hovers for about 10 minutes, before slowly moving East.;2010-10-04 10:00:00;15 minutes;Bright white light over Lynnwood, WA, hovers for about 10 minutes, before slowly moving East. Somewhere around 10:00am on October 4, 2010, looking West from I-5 in Lynnwood. A fellow employee noticed a super bright white light in the sky west of lynnwood through his office window and asked if I saw it.  The skies were mostly clear with the upper clouds moving east and the lower clouds moving to the north.  I would guess the object was between the cloud layers. The object sat stationary for about 10 minutes.  It seemed to get smaller, and then back to its original size when we first saw it.  All 5 of us were speculating as to what it may be but nothing made much sense to me.  The brightness never changed during the entire event, even when it appeared smaller or slowly flew directly overhead to the east.  Just a very bright white light. At one point it looked like a triangular shape, at another point it looked like a baloon shape - could not really tell from the naked eye.  I don't know what it was, but a jet cannot hover, I think a weather balloon would have been influenced by the winds and would not have moved east at a faster pace than the clouds, and a reflection of the sun off a metallic object would have changed as it flew directly overhead and been more yellow in color. One person believed he saw a halo shape above it. I am not sure what it was.  It was too far to see a definate shape or hear any noise from it.  Probably a rational explanation, but perhaps other have seen it or may know what it was.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Two High balls of Orange light southwest of Seattle on 4th of July about 10:30pm.;2014-07-04 22:30:00;15 minutes;Two High balls of Orange light southwest of Seattle on 4th of July about 10:30pm Letting  off fireworks in the neighborhood I noticed 2 balls of orange light high in the sky....roughly southwest of downtown Seattle.  They were  a decent size, not moving very fast. I kept glancing up thinking they would sooner or later get closer but then 1 disappeared.  They were too high to be a lantern and probably 5 or 6 times larger than a planet.   I sort of discounted it and didn't even mention it to friends/neighbors.  I just assumed it was a helicopter or something.  But....very consistent glow and shape without a lot of movement.  After 15 minutes or so, they were both gone.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
I saw a bright light in the sky, and it wasn't a plane because there were no flashing lights, then it disappeared. ((anonymous report));2017-06-07 19:00:00;1-5 minute;I saw a bright light in the sky, and it wasn't a plane because there were no flashing lights, then it disappeared right before my eyes. When my sister and I were playing volleyball outside, I saw a bright light.  As a space fanatic, I thought it was a UFO.  My sister disagreed and said it was a plane, and we continued to play.   I looked back at it seconds later, and the light weren't flashing like planes do.  My sister then started to believe me.  I stared at it for a couple of seconds, and right before my eyes, it was slowly moving, and disappeared.  I was in complete awe.
