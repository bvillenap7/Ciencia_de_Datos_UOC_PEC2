A bright red light hovers in the sky and then disappears.;1993-07-01 01:00:00;several minutes;SUMMARY:  A bright red light hovers in the sky and then disappears. One night in July 1993, while lying in bed, I spotted through my mini-blinds a jewel-toned, red light hovering in the air where normally there would be none. I peeked through my blinds and saw a red light through the trees.  I went to my deck where I could see unobstructed and the red light was about 100 yards high.  It was a light that looked like a ruby with light coming through it.  It moved 2-3 degrees left and then right and then it disappeared.  The observer is a suburban housewife with a background in journalism and advertising.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Interesting aerial phenomena just after darkfall;2002-09-04 21:24:00;2 minutes;Interesting aerial phenomena just after darkfall I was outside letting the dogs have their moment, before going inside to catch something interesting on the TV.  The sighting took place at almost exactly 2124, according to my cable box before I went outside (I was watching Junkyard Wars got an addiction to it).  The angle of view that I have from the backyard is small.  I was facing due East, and looking up to see Cassiopea (just to be sure I could still locate it, I was an amateur astronomer in my teens).  I noticed a very bright light, travelling at about the same speed as a satellite.  It travelled from north out of Cassiopea to the south in almost direct North to South direction.  Once it left the constellation of Cassiopea, it headed towards a large fir tree that I was standing almost under.  It slowly began to fade out, to a dot, then to nothing.  The trees that caused the narrowness of my observation are in a line on the property line between our neighbors and our house.  I stepped back and went around under the tree to see if the light would brighten again and reappear (again, too much high end cable I thought of the solar panels discarded by the astronauts from the space shuttle, that never really re-entered..).  Needless to say, it didn't.  I returned to my original position, and looked back up to make a sighting of the area that I saw this interesting phenomenon, and saw it happen again!  Exactly in the same manner!  Again I retreated under the tree, and looked to see if it reappeared.  It didn't.  During the first observation, I noticed a standard jet liner (Paine Field and SeaTac both have planes visible in holding/landing patterns in this area) flying under the object...  Very obviously under the object, with sound and all the attendant lights.  After observing this, I realized that total darkness had happened somewhere around 2050 to 2110 pm.  Whatever it was I saw, I firmly believe was of terrestrial origin.  Both of these objects had an interval of about 1 minute between sightings, and followed the exact same trajectory, and brig! htness t o disappearance ratio during the time of visibility.  I think that whatever it was was either, a) a set of high flying aircraft, that had no paint (i.e. aluminum skin or some other reflective surface), or b) a set LEO (low earth orbit) satellites that caught the suns' rays at just the right place and just the right time, before travelling out of the sun's light and into shadow.  There were absolutely no trails from the objects, and both were exactly the same in appearance and disappearance.  I wish I knew what they really were!  I'd like to note, after making a selection below this text box, that there were aircraft in the sky, but they were NOT chasing the objects I viewed, they just made the idea that they were LEO much more attractive. For the investigators: If an investigator would like to contact me I work odd hours, please leave a message on my voice mail system if you don't reach me immediately.  I would be glad to call you back and further discuss/investigate this interesting phenomenon.  I also do not check this email address but once every few days (work email is faster, but I wouldn't commit this through a corporately controlled system, thanks ), so phone contact is best....;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Amber light formation in sky above Lynnwood, WA at 19:07 on 3/13/10;2010-03-13 19:07:00;1 Minute;Amber light formation in sky above Lynnwood, WA at 19:07 on 3/13/10 While driving north on SR 99  (Aurora Ave N) I had just crossed into Edmonds, WA, when I noticed a formation of amber colored lights in a N/NE direction.  The location would be approximately Lynnwood, WA.  There appeared to be a diamond pattern of lights somewhat close together and then two single lights, one off to the right of the diamond and one off to the left.   I called a friend's cell phone to see if they could see it from their location so I do have a phone record of the occurence.  After a short time period of maybe 30 seconds, the lights began to disappear one by one but all were gone within 10 seconds.  I was on my way to a small party at the home of friends and told the host about the sighting as soon as I arrived.  I must say the event was strikingly similar to those I have seen on TV shows or websites.  I am not a UFO chaser or even believer but this certainly did appear to be real to me.  I am hoping someone could corroborate my story. I did call the Lyn! nwood Police Dept to see if anyone else had reported seeing it but the person who answered the phone hadn't heard any other reports.I also scanned the local news on the chance that someone called the TV stations but didn't find anything.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Amber light heading west over Lynnwood, Washington.;2010-07-04 23:40:00;1 min;Amber light heading west over Lynnwood Washington. A amber light came into view traveling very fast along the tree horizon.  From a east direction heading westerly.  It traveled in a 20 degree upward angle for aprox.  3 miles, then slowed down headed in a southerly direction and proceeded out of sight.  The object was in view long enough for me to go and get my binoculars and run back outside, however all I could see was an amber light, for another 15 to 20 seconds.  This was not a flare or a firework.  It was traveling as fast as an F18 but made no noise and was approximately 5 to 8 miles away.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Dot of light moving quickly across the sky NNE to SSE and back a few minutes later S to NNE dir..  ((NUFORC Note:   NotSatellite?  PD));2010-08-14 23:45:00;5 minutes;Dot of light moving quickly across the sky N-NE to S-SE and back a few minutes later S to N-NE direction We were just enjoying the summer night, looking at the stars and hoping for a chance to see a meteor. Instead we see a high flying object, a dot of light traveling in a North-northeast to south-southeast direction.   As a single dot of light mixed with the stars, it continued south at high rate of speed.  We continued to observe the stars and look for meteors but to our surprise the dot of light came back on a similar path south to north-east direction.  It disappeared as light contamination prevented tracking any further. ((NUFORC Note:   NotSatellite?  PD));47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Bright white light moving downwards fast.;2018-10-02 22:50:00;1-2 seconds;Bright white light moving downwards fast. I was on my balcony when I saw movement to the north/northwest.  I looked over and saw a bright white light moving straight down several miles away, starting at about position angle 30 or so from my position. I only saw it for about a second before it was below the treeline. I have worked maritime search and rescue before so I know it was not a flare or firework as it's descent was too fast and did not seem to be burning, and it was also too fast for a plane or helicopter...I saw no additional lights that those craft would have on wings or tail, just the white light, though it would have been in the rough direction of Paine Field. It looked as though it was intentionally moving down in a straight line, not crashing or falling.  It also seemed much too bright to be light reflecting from a bird or bat, and there was nothing else in the sky that I saw that it could have fallen from.  I continued to watch that direction for about 10 minutes and did not see it again.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
2 lights zig zagging across the sky with super bright lights and then the light would get dim and fade away.
