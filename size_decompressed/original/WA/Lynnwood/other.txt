Noticed object low and far in Western sky just north of setting sun. Object was round and did not move.;1997-08-08 21:06:00;16 minutes;Summary : Noticed object low and far in Western sky just north of setting sun. Object was round and did not move. Driving West Bound on 164th St SW (6th Ave W cross street)in Martha Lake area of Lynnwood, WA and noticed a bright round object in the setting sun light.  It looked far off in the distance like out over the Pacific Ocean.  It looked large.  It seemed odd that it was large enough to block enough of the setting sun light to be visible and to aparently twinkle (emit its own light).  Intreagued I watched it intently.  It did not move relative to the horizon or the setting sun.  I then turned south on 13th Ave W past ELDEC (Crane) Electronics and lost sight of the object behind trees.  I then kept driving and eventually got to the Target store at Alderwood Mall (184th and Alderwood Mall Blvd in Lynnwood) and the object was still there and had not moved in the sky and still looked the same in terms of the light being emitted and the ability of the object to be seen through the brightness of the setting sun.  I got out of my truck and observed the object for approximately 2 minutes! and said wow it just isn't moving.  I went into the Target Store at 9:22 pm and the object was still there.  I came back out around 9:45 pm and it was gone from the sky.  I was the only one to witness this-I was alone.  My background-Local person grew up here. ((Deleted)) Engineering degree from UW.  Worked in Construction Management for 6 years, as a engineer for a ((deleted)) company for a year and I am now a ((deleted)) engineer at ((Company and projects deleted)).  I have a lot of aerospace background from a general interest and my current employment.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
All witnessed the sighting through the telescope.  ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the object was seen on two nights, we suspect Venus. PD));2009-01-02 18:00:00;1 hour;At the start time of this sighting, my husband and son noticed a bright light in the far distant sky from my son's bedroom window.  We documented seeing the same bright light, same location 1 month ago with eyes and binocular's. This time, my husband moved our telescope to his room and took 10 minutes or so to focus in on the bright round light.  He compared it to the moon focus which could not totally fit in the scope but when focusing on the bright light it became clearly centered in the middle of the scope and was distinctly a link of round lights making up two seperate rings. In the middle of the inner ring, it appears to be straight lights/beams of light toward the center of the circle.  Kinda of like wedges formed in the center of the ring.  At one point, three lights equally became brighter than the rest. We all witnessed the sighting through the telescope and at first I would say it was the bottom of a huge space craft but not sure if the beams were lights all towards the center of the ring like a gateway. Additionally, for a breif moment towards the end of the sighting, small white dots appeared to be darting to and from the main object. Clouds started to obscure the sighting and I saw a blue flash behind the clouds and when then the object was gone. Tonight, returning from dinner, the bright light was seen from the front of our home and when we went to use our telescope, the clouds blocked the vision again.  During our ride towards the home, the clouds did not appear to be the same thickness  ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the object was seen on two nights, we suspect Venus.

I came out to my balcony to smoke a cigarette I was just about to light it when for some reason i turned around, keep in mind im on the second floor when over the roof of my apartments from a distance i saw wat it appeared to be a pyramid shaped object resembling the pyramids of egypt it wasnt as big but i can say it was as big as a two story house but obviously in the shape of a pyramid.  Wat blew my mind tho was the fact that it was a shinning golden pyramid, I could clearly see the lines that outlined each block massive blocks of gold and at the bottom of the pyramid i could see wat was 3 circles positioned as a triangle where fire was coming out of them.  The same thing you see when you look at a back of a fighter jet.   And at the same time it was flying it was spining inot to fast not to slow and it flew at a steady pace, I managed to see it as it was coming when it past right over me thats how! i could see the fire coming out the bottom and still saw as it kept going out of my sight of view i can say the object wast about 3 or 4 stories above me. I would also like to put down that im not trying to get anything out of this no fame no money im just trying to describe wat i saw. It will help me from not going crazy since i really cant tell nobody else thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

1/3 sky being lit by changing colored lights, behind dense low clouds;2011-07-18 03:15:00;10 minutes;1/3 sky being lit by changing colored lights, behind dense low clouds 7/18/2011 – Lynnwood Washington 3:15 Am.  Low dense clouds surround area, I saw a flash of white light to my left (lit up the sky like lightening) the flash moved across sky and began really lighting up the sky to my right.  I waited for the sound of thunder or a plane (some sort of noise) I heard nothing.   The right side of the sky began to lightly strobe changing colors.  The strobe began to turn red to orange, orange to green, green to blue and repeat over and over, lighting up 1/3 of the sky behind low moving dense clouds.   I watched for at least 10 minutes.  The light show continued as I went in to get ready for work.     I Left the house 15 minutes later and the sky was totally clear.

Bluish glowing 3 foot pillar shaped object at tree level beeps and flies away at extremely fast speed.;2012-11-10 22:00:00;4 seconds;bluish glowing 3 foot pillar shaped object at tree level beeps and flies away at extremely fast speed. I am very near sighted and cannot see the stars without glasses, so I had just gotten home from grocery shopping and I decided to try on my glasses to see the stars because my mom said the sky was very clear that night. It was around 10pm.   As I step outside and look up I see many stars and I’m awestruck by how beautiful they were and I’m just gazing at all the night sky trying to find constellations, and as I look behind me I see a bluish glowing light in between the trees and I try to focus more on it and it reacts as if it noticed I had spotted it so it sort of jerked up and made a beeping noise and the twinkling lights on the bottom flashed and it descended into the air and it was a pillar shape about 3 feet in length.   At that moment my brother was coming towards me to tell me something and I told him to look up, and at that moment it zipped away 100 feet in about a second. It was impossibly fast, and at the edge of the sky it seemed to flash and disappear.  I immediately asked my brother if he had also seen what I had just seen and we were both very confused to what we had just seen.  So we went inside and tried to figure it out but eventually concluded it was an unidentified flying object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
