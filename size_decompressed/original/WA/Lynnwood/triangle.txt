It had lights placed in a sporadic fashion on the bottom and made no sound as it moved toward us. It banked to the right and was gone in a few seconds going toward the Olympic Mountain Range over the Puget Sound. We spoke to the Police Officers that witnessed it shortly after at the Police Station. We were advised by the Police Department to report the sighting to the Natl. UFO Hotline which we did. It began when we heard the Officer on a Police Scanner call in about a very bright light in the sky above his car in a area that was at the time being developed. We left and went into tne vicinity and witnessed it from about a mile from his locatin. He was joined by another officer. I am writing in response to hearing other sightings recently that seem to be very close to what we witnessed. AROUND July 1978 WE WERE AT MY PARENTS HOUSE AND HAPPENED TO HEAR ON A POLICE SCANNER THAT A POLICE OFFICE IN LYNNWOOD WA. WAS REPORTING SEEING A VERY, VERY BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY. HE WAS ABOUT A MILE FROM DOWNTOWN LYNNWOOD WHEN HE SAW A LIGHT THAT BEGAN TO DESCEND FROM THE SKY. HE CALLED TO REPORT IT AND THEN REQUESTED ANOTHER OFFICER JOIN HIM. AT THE TIME WE WERE IN EDMONDS AND LEFT TO GO TO THE VICINITY THEY WERE. DRIVING INTO DOWNTOWN WE DECIDED TO GO UP ON A HILL THAT IS ACROSS TOWN (MAYBE A MILE) FROM WHERE THE OFFICERS WERE. WE SAW A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS STATIONARY IN THE SKY AND WATCHED IT UNTIL IT BEGAN TO MOVE ACROSS THE SKY TOWARD THE DIRECTION WE WERE OBSERVING FROM. THE LIGHT THEN BECAME A VERY LARGE TRIANGULAR OBJECT THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ALMOST SOMEWHAT ROUNDED SIDES TO IT. IT CONTINUED OUR DIRECTION, IT APPEARED TO BE AT LEAST AS LARGE AS A FOOTBALL FIELD. IT MADE NO NOISE AND HAD LIGHTS THAT WERE POSITIONED IN AN ODD WAY.  DO NOT RECALL THE LIGHTS AS HAVING COLOR. IT QUICKLY BANKED TO THE RIGHT AND WITHIN A FEW 2-3 SECONDS IT DISSAPEARED OUT OVER THE PUGET SOUND TOWARD THE OLYMPIC MOUNTAIN RANGE. WE SPOKE BRIEFLY WITH THE OFFICERS THE THE LYNNWODD POLICE STATION AFTERWARD AND THEN WE WERE ADVISED TO CALL THE UFO HOTLINE AND MAKE A REPORT WHICH WE DID. I AM WRITING TO YOU TONIGHT AFTER HEARING YOUR SHOW TODAY ON KIRO RADIO AND HEARING WHAT WAS SO CLOSE TO SOMETHING I WILL NEVER FORGET. YOU MAY EMAIL ME IF YOU WOULD LIKE ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Small black oblongish flattened triangle traveling N to W near North Seattle at elevation 30 degrees.;2000-06-12 17:20:00;35 seconds;Small black oblongish flattened triangle traveling N to W near North Seattle at elevation 30 degrees. North Seattle (Lynwood/Mill Creek), 5:20 PM. One small dull black object went from north (nearest to me) to west(farthest point from me) in 35 seconds. It was at an elevation of 30 degrees to the ground and remained at that as it traversed a 70 degree span of sky. It crossed below large white cumulous clouds. The clouds were moving NW. The object appeared as a peculiar balloon (roundish and blobbly) for the 1st 4 seconds and then as a flattened triangle. It's trajectory was absolutely straight with no variation in speed. From my point of view, it was moving very fast and methodically. It disappeared into the distance (became so faint you could no longer view it). I drove 5 blocks away and watched the sky in it's direction-4 crows harrassing an eagle-nothing about the birds resembled the black object-not shape or flight characteristics. The object was between an eigth to a qaurter of an inch at arms length when I first spotted it. There were no wings or protusions of any kind, a smooth oblongish triangle with rounded edges. More like a triangular oval flying in the direction of it's flat side. I don't know what this object was, maybe it was a bird with a mission, I wrote this report in case someone else got a better look. ((NUFORC Note:  We know the person who submitted the report, and consider her to be highly reliable.  The object's angular velocity across the sky seems to exceed what would be possible for an aircraft.  It seems to have been a very unusual sighting.  PD));47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
dark silent triangular object 500 ft above Lynnwood on cloudy night;2001-11-05 23:30:00;<1 minute;dark silent triangular object 500 ft above Lynnwood on cloudy night Was outside in parking lot of apartment complex trying to see the northern lights through the clouds. I saw something move out of the corner of my eye up in the sky to my right (north). I looked and at first thought it was a large bird. But I watched it and realized it was definitely not a bird. My guess (very hard to estimate something you see briefly in the dark) was that it was a metallic (dark metal...like stealth material) triangular object maybe the size of a helicopter or small plane. It glided quickly and silently (no noise AT ALL) about 500 feet (??) above the buildings in a south direction. I could see the bottom of it enough to make out something like landing gear or lights or something on the bottom, but it was dark. There were no lights at all. The only reason I saw it at all was because I happened to be looking at the sky in the middle of a city and well-lit apartment complex by a major street. I could make out the shape and bottom of the object because of the city lights just bright enough to allow me to see something...although just barely. I could easily have missed a dark object floating across a dark cloudy sky! I only saw it for maybe 10-15 seconds, as it was quickly out of my view and across the street.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
triangle craft overhead, Big, Washington state 03';2003-01-20 18:20:00;20 seconds;triangle craft overhead, Big, Washington state 03' My brother and I witnessed a slow steady white light turning of then on many times, he thought it was a radio tower, but after about 30 seconds the light stopped the (SOS) type flashes and steadily moved to the right and out of view.  I figured It was probably a news helicopter because of rush hour traffic logicaly Still I have never seen a plane or heli. do a steady SLOW beat, like a large search light going off and on. I got to my house In lynnwood washington, and saw two close yellow lights just over the trees behind our house, looked like a 747 when they are faced at you flying twards you so at that time it wasnt to odd to see because of our location airports ect. , but the craft never crested over those trees, it actually went down like either moving away or dropping in alt. Soo.. after I changed to go play HALO at a friends house I witnessed the last part of the sighting.  My brother was with me and I was about to get into my car when I saw the same two yellowish white lights coming from the right of the trees this time I watched it for about 10 seconds then noticed no sound and told my brother to get out of the car and look at this, he did and by the time he got out of the car it was over head and had three yellowish white lights in a perfect triangle , as it went over head I couldnt hear anything, but as it was past us to the North we started to hear what sounded like a low frequancy jet type sound but very quite and very low.I was exstatic because I have witnessed a triangle craft that to me was a UFO.  After we calmed down we started to drive the two miles to our friends house and on the way about halfway, we both witnessed another strobe search lite craft, I was alot closer this time it and thought it might have been the tail guy saying OK your through everything back to normal in the sky?? After I started thinking about it for a day I got to thinking the first strobe object we saw might have been the clear craft to clear the way for this huge triangle craft and the last strobe craft was to close the line so to speak or bring up the rear. Kind of like an over sized load on the freeway with the start car and the back car maybe, now if that is true then what we saw was probably human craft but MAN was it kewl and ill tell you alot kewler then the old stealth bombers!! ohh one last thing I forget to say at the time the triangle craft was over our heads my cat jumped into my car and refused to come out of the back, I was starting to get weirded out because I had to drag him from the back and hold him, he was shaking and apeared scared? maybe someone has some insite on what is REALLY going on contact me at ((e-address deleted));47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Three lights.  They one in front corrected itself by moving right and backwards to form a triangle.;2003-04-27 22:30:00;15 seconds;Three lights.  They one in front corrected itself by moving right and backwards to form a triangle. Three yellow lights in the form of a triangle.  The front light was to the right of the formation and as it was flying (east to west)it moved in front of the formation and backwards to get into an a perfect triangle.  Flew about 200 to 300 feet high (as an airplane) but very swiftly and there was no motor sounds.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
