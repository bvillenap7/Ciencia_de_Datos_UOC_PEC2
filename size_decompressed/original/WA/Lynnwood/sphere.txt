9 objects reddish orange in formation  east of lynnwood;2001-02-24 16:00:00;4min;9 objects reddish orange in formation  east of lynnwood looking eastward towards the cascades-at first only about four bright spherical objects were noticed.They appeared to be in formation (almost constellation like-or as my wife observed an an absolute value formation. Each object was reddish-orange and seemed to shift colors.As we observed we noticed more objects joining thegroup.the new ones seemed clear at first then gained colors as they came into view. we had enough time to capture the tail end of the episode on video-a must see. uppon exit objects traveld east and south of our position. when fist observed they were above tree-line..as they left I adjusted my position to a street nearby that gave a better long distant veiw of their direction of travel but they were gone and I saw nothing else... mundane or otherwise .I might also mention they were definatley not hot air baloons(give me a break) ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous, so we are unable to contact the witness for more details.

Observed 3 spherical shaped objects in the sky above our heads. One moved slowly away to the south.;2005-06-25 19:00:00;10 minutes;Observed 3 spherical shaped objects in the sky above our heads. One moved slowly away to the south. Saturday I was outside looking at the clouds and beautiful sky and had seen a Bald eagle flying up with some light clouds moving to the east.  I went back inside for a 30 minutes and then went back out to see a clear sky. All the clouds had blown over to the Cascade mountains. In a split second I looked adjacent to a Hemlock tree top. Very high in the sky was an object that appeared spherical, due to the shading of the object. It was the size of a small womens ball type earing. It appeared stationary. Immediately I called for my friend who came out of the house and I showed it to her. She said, what could that be? I said, I don't know but it stayed there for a while so I wanted someone else to see it. She has 20/20 vision and immediately clearly noticed another one more toward the east of the larger one first sighted. I then saw another one further north and approximately 10 to 15 degrees away from the other but it was smaller and more toward the Cascade mountains. We observed a total of three, only one, the first was larger. The larger one started moving in a relative southern direction or to our right. I called her son out and he observed the one larger one as well. We stood and observed and then her and the son went in. I looked away for a moment and the large spherical object disappeared and then the others. No images were taken. To provide a reference I would say they were at least a foot appart from the visual perspective but not aligned in a straight line with each other .;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
light blue sphear followed by dark helicopter in may of 2009 (Washington State);2009-05-21 20:45:00;approx. 50 seconds;light blue sphere followed by dark helicopter in may of 2009  (Washington State)   on the evening in question last summer my girlfriend and I where walking home from the grocery store and decided to take a trail through a wooded area behind some buildings. all the buildings we passed where business that where closed for the night.. a couple of those business had windows facing the wooded area. We noticed what appeared to be an elderly woman (70's 80's) in a robe in one of the windows? she looked terrified, as though she had seen a ghost and she was standing in the window with her arms outstretched from her sides. I was curious as to what she was even doing in this building which we new was vacant by this time every night, but more importantly what was she staring at? so I looked up to the portion of the sky that the woman appeared to be hypnotized by.. there was the object.. a solid light blue sphere. The object appeared over our head at about 8:50 pm. and seemed to be wobbling slightly up and down as it passed almost directly over our heads about 1200 - 1500 feet above the ground.  The object appeared to be traveling at a steady 250 to 350 miles an hour and was void of any sound.  We watched the object for about 45 seconds unti! l it left our field of view it was followed by an dark helicopter at the same general altitude (with sound) and and then a commercial jet flew over in a different direction (also with sound) about 30 seconds after that at a regular altitude of about 35,000 ft. I can trust my own judgment of this event due to the fact that I am very familiar with commercial and military aircraft due to a former profession (precision machinist & aviation mechanic) this object was NOT a regular AIRCRAFT and it definitely DID NOT employ the use of any conventional propulsion unit. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Two lights gold and blue distinctly separate, low.;2011-03-07 19:00:00;3-4 min;Two lights gold and blue distinctly separate, low. The time was between 7 to 7:30pm. I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette facing west. The moon was in a cresent shape that's what drew my attention, I observed two bright spheres heading east. One of the lights was an amber/gold in color the other bright blue but half the size of the other. They were at what appeared to be the average altitude that i've seen most helicopters in this area flying at, just much faster. It's hard to say how far apart they were but the kept a perfect distance from each other, in a semi arc toward the south east. It's fairly dark and quiet where I live and they made no discernible sound.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Fast red/orange light over western Washinton		.;2014-11-12 19:00:00;5 seconds;Fast red/orange light over western Washinton		 I was taking out the garbage at about 19:00, I and paused to enjoy the stars. I was looking to the northeast.  I suddenly saw a small red/orange round light make a very tight and fast clockwise circle in the sky.  I lost sight of it for a moment, but then it reappeared for a moment, and then shot either straight up or toward me at an angle.  From my perspective, it was well above treetop level, higher than usual fireworks seen during celebrations.  I let out a couple of yelps of, “hey hey,” to see if any of my other neighbors were out so that I could draw their attention to what I was watching so that I was not the only witness.  I received no response from my neighbors, but stayed out to see if I could spot the light again, but saw nothing.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Shape-shifting multi-colored spheres above Seattle.;2015-07-12 17:30:00;3 minutes;Shapeshifting multi-colored spheres above Seattle. On July 12th, at approximately 6:30p.m., I noticed an unrecognizable shape in the sky.  I grabbed my camera called to my wife to come see and started shooting.   I watched as this grouping of multicolored spheres started to change shape and seemingly get larger, then smaller.  At times they would stretch out a little while changing to another configuration.  Sometime the largest sphere would become detached.  There was an almost rainbow shimmer effect on the surface.   After just a couple minutes, it was gone as suddenly as it showed up.   I reviewed the images right away and zoomed in for a better look.  I still cannot identify them.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Bright yellow-orange glowing orb hovers over Lynnwood, WA, neighborhood;2020-08-17 00:31:00;3 hours;Bright yellow-orange glowing orb hovers over Lynnwood, WA, neighborhood I am 61 yrs old when this occurred. I have an M.S. in Information Systems Management and I work as an IT Project Manager for a large local employer, where I have worked for many years.  Report – Occurrence on Aug 17, 2020 Lynnwood, Washington  On the morning of Aug 17, 2020, at 12:31 am, I was awakened in my home in Lynnwood, WA, by a bright yellow-orange light shining into my upstairs bedroom window.  The source of the light was spherical, self-illuminated, approximately 10-20% smaller than a full moon, but much, much brighter.  It seemed like it was shining into my eyes – but it didn’t make me want to blink as it didn’t hurt my eyes.  I stared at the object for about 8 seconds before it blinked out. The window faces west. The orb was stationary, at approximately 175-225 ft in the air depending on how far away it was. (I am estimating its elevation in comparison to the height of some tall conifer trees. It was near the top of one of those very tall trees. If the orb was farther away, then my elevation estimate is probably wrong. I kept looking out the window in case something else happened. A minute or two after the orb blinked out, my window was illuminated with a bright white light. I had blinds pulled down but angled open between each blind so that some light from the sky could come in, and I could see stars on a clear night.  The bright white light illuminated the window for 10-12 seconds before it went out.  I thought it might be someone’s (or even my own) motion-activated light.  But the next day I realized that couldn’t be right because my motion-activated light is not nearly as bright and is set to stay on for 10 minutes.  This light stayed on for 10-12 seconds, then went out, then came back on 4 or 5 minutes later, stayed on for 10-12 seconds again, then went out, then came on a third time, stayed on the same length of time, then went out again.  When the window would light up, it looked like a glowing-white rectangle against a black background—almost like looking at a film negative.  I kept watc! hing the window but the light didn’t come on again while I was watching.  I didn’t get up to look out the window.  I was a bit scared to do that as I didn’t want to attract any attention to myself.  This time period where my window was being illuminated lasted about 20 minutes. I tried to go back to sleep but I tossed and turned and slept fitfully after this. There was a dog outside barking, coming from the same direction as where I saw the orb. It would bark for a while, go quiet, bark some more, and this intermittent barking kept waking me up. I felt like I finally went to sleep and then I was awakened by the dog barking crazily…more intense than before. I opened my eyes and there was that same orange-yellow orb again, in a slightly different position…a little bit north but still shining into my window. I was only able to look at it for about 1 second before it winked out. The way it winked out, it looked like it collapsed inward from the two vertical-ish (  ) sides, so that for a half-second I could see a vertical orange line before it went all the way out. I thought it was strange that as soon as I opened my eyes, there was that orb again, but only for a second. As if to say “Bu-bye!” I looked at my clock again and it was around 3:30-3:35 am.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
