1 slow but steady-moving 'cruise ship sized' object w/lights moving from WEST to EAST, & NOT toward Pac. Ocean;1997-11-14 20:00:00;5-6 minutes;1 slow but steady-moving 'cruise ship sized' object w/lights moving from WEST to EAST, & NOT toward Pac. Ocean You don't even have to print this, (just for the files).........it's just a follow-up Wanting to support/back up info to a VERY old sighting (1997?)that has bothered us for years. We only knew it was the later 90's, in our former residence, now I literally stumbled on to this site. Always thought I/we were hallucinating even tho we are NOT superstitious, own tinfoil hats etc etc. Now I read where numerous other people saw the same thing, (11-14-1997) NOT what the local WA state media reported, laughing it off as Russian space junk headed for the Pacific Ocean & a watery grave. Horsey-puck. Others, we now know, watched it go from West TO East, like us.  The Pacific Ocean is/was to our LEFT while facing North.  (still is)  That would be West.  We all watched it go TOWARD the Cascade Mt. Range & small communities in the foothills like Duvall, WA. Very giant 'looking' like a cruise ship, VERY faint but dull hum (not unlike the Goodyear Blimp during Seafair.)  Hum could very well have been from something else.  Moved smoothly(methodically?) right along, steady speed, did NOT shoot across the sky as a fireball. It was a clear night, looking North, about 20:00 (8 pm?) seemed low in the sky, no obstacles between us, even trees.  Husband headed in to see if he could find the video camera, but it was pretty dark for our cheapo equipment. Can't understand why the local condescending media told me they had a news reporter headed for the Carnation/Duvall area of the Cascade foothills (NOT toward Puget Sound/Pacific Ocean). I've NEVER bothered with reporting strange happenings, no biggie, but NOW I know it really happened as we remember (we'll never forget).  Just wanted to add our two cents worth & add to the reports. And the media wonders why people don't give them much credibility for accurate reporting. Thanks!!  March of 2015;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Near Seattle, east to west siting, full stop, and then lit large object;2004-07-24 23:00:00;3 seconds;Near Seattle, east to west siting, full stop, and then lit large object July 24, 2004  11:17 pm Driving on I-5 southbound, 405 interchange, before Lynnwood  I was a passenger in a car traveling southbound on I-5 when something caught my eye in the night sky. I saw a disturbance in the atmosphere, a streak of thin light appeared at approximately the 11 o’clock position moving east to west in a straight line to the 1 o’clock position at great speeds before it came to a full stop, and it then lit up briefly in a giant symmetrical walnut shape before disappearing.  The best way to describe the intensity of this object when lit, was like a car headlight using its high beams. Very bright, and I got a good look at it. It lit up in a stopped position for about a second and a half and then disappeared.  The entire episode took about 3 seconds.  The driver of the car saw nothing, but was quite disturbed by my reaction to what I saw.  I am a project manager, the driver of the car is an engineer. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be an exceptionally credible witness.  He description of the event was quite factual and objective.  We suspect that her report is quite accurate.  PD));47.832124852071;-122.270775147929

Still in awe over what I had just seen, another orb with the same description flew over head. this time at a higher altitude but still traveling in the same direction.
