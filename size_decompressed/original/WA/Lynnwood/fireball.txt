Large fireball sighting;2002-10-01 05:45:00;5 seconds;Large fireball sighting At 5:45 a.m.(PST), I was traveling northbound on I-5 when I witnessed a large, bright yellow fireball, with blue edges, shooting across the sky. I was unable to distinguish its distance from me because it appeared out of nowhere and vanished within about 5 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor.  Many other reports.

Red Fiery Circular Craft;2012-07-04 22:45:00;2 hours;Red Fiery Circular Craft July 4th 2012 Around 9:45 till around 11:30 pm Lynnwood, Washington. I was outside with my Daughter watching the local Fireworks and as we were watching we saw what  Looked to be a Red Orange Circular Object that was glowing and moving from left to right in the  Southern sky. The object was caught on video from me quite a few times throughout those times.  It looked as  though it was in and out of focus even though I had my camera on it the whole time.  We are close to  Paine Field and are constantly seeing aircraft and know the difference between the two.  I either had a  satellite or a Star as a reference point and the Star or Sattelite was stationary. I am not quite sure of the altitude of this glowing object but I do know that it was much higher than  an airplane.  This object I have never seen before and am not quite sure what it was?;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
Red ball of fire seen over Lynnwood.;2013-07-04 23:00:00;3 minutes;Red ball of fire seen over Lynnwood. We were watching the fireworks  from our yard.   As I was watching I looked a little farther up and saw what I thought looked like a fireball in the sky.  At first I thought it was just some weird firework, but it kept traveling towards us.  I thought this can't be a firework, maybe fireworks had hit a low flying plane and it was on fire.   I called to my friend and said, look at this!  Do you know what that is?  She had no clue.  It kept coming closer, and as it did, it did look a little triangle shaped, but hard to tell because it looked like flames burning all over.   As it came more directly overhead I saw a red light coming from the front that came out into a fan shape. We kept watching it as it traveled farther south and then it was gone.  Neither one of us could explan that.   Been watching the news, other people had to see and maybe someone else has an explanation.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929

Large Orange ball apeared in sky above houses and trees, then slowly fell below tree line, mimicking a falling star;2014-04-02 20:45:00;10 seconds;Large Orange ball apeared in sky above houses and trees, then slowly fell below tree line, mimicking a falling star It was a mostly clear night with very little clouds or fog.  While locking my front door as I left my house, I quickly glanced up in the sky northward.  Above the trees and houses about 4-6 blocks north of my house, an orange ball of light appeared and then fell slowly, almost like a shooting star but without the tail.  The ball of light was much larger than any stars in the sky, had an amber color, and made no sound.  I realized the orange glowing ball wasnâ€™t a shooting star, or plane, because the object fell below the tree lines and was much larger and brighter than any stars I have experienced previously.  I called my friend, and told her I saw something strange without giving her any details.  She told me she saw an orange ball of light too (She was 3-4 miles west) and explained exactly what I saw but from another angle.;47.832124852071;-122.270775147929
