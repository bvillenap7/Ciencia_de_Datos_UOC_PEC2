craft hovers silently changing shape. possible abduction.;2010-11-15 13:05:00;20 minutes;craft hovers silently changing shape. possible abduction. Me and 2 buddies of mine were sitting on the deck smoking a cigarette when I happened to look up and see some sort of craft approximately 600ft away fly left to right in an arc.  The craft moved very slowly and there were red and green lights that seemed to be rotating on the bottom.  The object also seemed fluid like and constantly changing shape.  I know what I saw. We may have been tripping on acid a little but I know what I saw was real.  There was a light that came out of the bottom and it looked like there was a cow being lifted into the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  The date of the sighting is unclear to us, and we have assigned an arbitrary date in November 2010.
