3 colored lights that changed direction;2016-07-19 22:00:00;10 seconds;3 colored lights that changed direction It was exactly 10 p.m. I saw 3 glowing lights red and green color it went down and then shot up and to the left and then straight out and disappeared like it hit warp speed. So basically the red and green lights went down and then when it went to the left and out it hit  warp speed and made a bright white light It lasted about 10-15 seconds.  I was standing on my back porch letting my dog out who before I let him out was acting oddly.  And I look up and noticed that the sky looked oddly light blue, and that's when I saw it. I know it wasn't a satellite and I know it wasn't an airplane I've never seen anything like that before.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
Multiple colored triangle comes and flies directly over me at tree top level very slowly;2019-02-28 04:00:00;15 minutes;Multiple colored triangle comes and flies directly over me at tree top level very slowly. So it's 539 a. m.,  approximately 1 hour ago I was outside with my dog taking him potty and I'm a huge astronomy, paranormal, multiple dimensions fan, as long as science is involved.  I go outside every single night with binoculars and watch the sky,  I live near a base, and there's trees everywhere around me and before tonight I've seen this light hovering behind a certain patch of trees, slowly bobbing in the same space and after so long I felt it was watching me. Well tonight is a crystal clear night, hardly any aircraft out right now and I see that same light hovering behind the trees, so I watch it with my binoculars and it slowly starts moving out from the trees and its orange, blinking quickly.  Suddenly once I had full view it started blinking a weird pattern of green and red, and moved to the east of me behind a building.  5 minutes later with no view of it I see a very bright light approaching me super slowly at tree top level, it flew right above me as slow as an aircraft can go I assume, and it was a triangle.  It had a red and green flashing light, and then a light at each corner and it almost looked Transparent, if all lights were off you wouldn't be able to see it. It flew right above me directly and made no sound,  it was the same one I saw hovering behind trees. I've seen this thing before watching me as well as various other odd aircraft.  I see airplanes daily and I know what military aircraft look like, I've never seen anything like this before but I got a warm feeling from it, no fear.  Welcome our visitors with love, don't be afraid.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
