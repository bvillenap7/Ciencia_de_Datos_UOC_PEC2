Approximately 11pm.  I noticed 2 orange lights came from the west (in a normally traveled commercial airline route). The 2 lights stoped side by side.  Split into 4 orange lights all arranged in the way that you would see the number 4 on a dise. It stayed that way a few minutes then the top left light went into the bottom right and the top right light went to the bottom left becoming 2 lights again. they stayed like that for 2 to 3 minutes then 1 shot up @45Â° angle and gone while the remaining orange light slowly headed west and over the over the horizon. Seconds later 2 jets took off out of McChord Air Force Base of Joint Base Lewis, off in that direction. All this was within a 20 min time span.   Commercial aircraft could then be seen at its normal intervals of 20 minutes or so. Peac;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898

They were silent and appeared to be roughy 5000ft AGL.   The two lights became stationary and their light became dim and switched to a bluish tint before disappearing.   Very strange.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898

Looked like it was coming from my under my bed. I heard a humming, zooming, sound.  I woke up my husband, but he just turned and fell back to sleep.  I turned the other way and fell back to sleep. Last time I saw this light, it was on Holiday Park on Mc Chord AFB, campsite 5 and 3, just last year in 2018.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
