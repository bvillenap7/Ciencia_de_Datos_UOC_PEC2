UFO Green chem light looking cylinder over Puget Sound.;2003-07-15 00:05:00;8 seconds;UFO Green chem light looking cylinder over Puget Sound. I was sitting in my living room facing my sliding glass door, which faces a wooded area over looking a bluff, at 12:05AM reading a book when I saw a bright flash in my peripheral vision. I then looked directly at a green glowing cylinder object that was moving Northwest over the Puget Sound appearing to descend at a constant rate of speed. The objects leading edge was at about a 15 degree dive the whole 8 seconds that I was able to view the object before it totally disappeared into the tree line. There was a high layer of clouds in the sky and this object was below the layer. I dialed 911 and was told that I was the fifth person to report the unexplained flying object. ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports about this incident.  Interestingly, reports were submitted only from the Seattle/Puget Sound area.  If the object had been a meteor, it should have been visible for hundreds or thousands of miles around.  PD));47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
