It took place back when I was 16, I am 34 now.  Dont know if it matters much.  I was pulling into a parking lot one night with a boyfriend.  He told me to look up, when I did a saw a huge fireball in the sky.  It suddenly stopped the had a blinking light and went behind some trees.  It was far away but is scared me so bad I went straight home to my mother and told her what I saw.  A few yrs ago it happened during the day.  I didnt see it but plenty of people had. It was on the news.  I dont care if anyone believes me or not.   I know what I saw and thats good enough for me.

Red fireball fading in and out, moving slowly through sky.;2010-07-04 22:00:00;30 minutes;Red fireball fading in and out, moving slowly through sky. What we saw was a bit startling, I'm sorry to be reporting so late, but I just found this site... we saw a bright red fireball, blinking on and off frequently.  It followed our car for quite some time, though when we stopped, it did keep moving, then it faded out until we started moving again, it would become illuminated again.  We were all scared and decided to head home.  I've never seen it again, but looking through this site, thousands of others saw this around the same date.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
3 orange fireballs heading west no sound and turned sw and ascended in a formation.;2013-03-30 20:57:00;5 minutes;3 orange fireballs heading west no sound and turned sw and ascended in a formation I was pulling out of a driveway and was making sure no traffic in either direction.  I looked to the east.  And then west and when looking back to east while pulling out 3 low flying bright orange appeares moving towards me and no sound was heard. I immediately put truck in park and got out to see what was going on and was very shocked and panicky. I was able to grab my cell phone from within truck and by the time I was able to get pictures the objects had shifted directions and were heading south.  They formed somewhat of a formation and were travelling at high speed with no noise.  No flashing and they appeared to be to look more saucer shaped from my pictures. I took 2 in regular mode and 2.in night mode.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
What is this?;2014-11-14 00:00:00;20;Laser test in the clouds,  son got this laser it was cool to light up clouds, only if it was dark enough.  Did for 5 minutes,  went back inside,  thought nothing.   5 minutes came back out with my bike, going to ride around the lake before bed.  When I jumped on bike going north, happen to look up saw 3 red balls, like glow balls pretty close over head.  Looked like getting closer.   Went in to get son asap and camera.  When my son came out, I was still looking for my phone. When I came back out they were gone but, my son was really excited and said he got them on his phone.  But, when I looked they were not red but white and only two.  I asked and he said he saw three the two.  They moved too weird for plane.  One direction than another in blink, then gone.   But, that's not all.  For days been seeing red balls, not really fire more like glowing red, small and very fast to change direction, than they  leave.  Very close, looks like over the lake even closer at times.  What is this?;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898

Red fireball/orb in night over Lakewood JBLM 9/13/16;2016-09-13 21:30:00;4 minutes;red fireball/orb in night over Lakewood JBLM 9/13/16 Saw a fireball/orb type in the sky. It was dark.  Always check on the stars right before I go to bed.  It was flying over Lakewood, JBLM.  Pretty slow, but not too slow.  Then it made a right angle turn (a v shape) and flew direction opposite, turned almost white then fizzled out. The atmosphere smelled like burning chemicals.  It was bizarre.  Not a plane (used to those in the flight path at JBLM), not a copter;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
