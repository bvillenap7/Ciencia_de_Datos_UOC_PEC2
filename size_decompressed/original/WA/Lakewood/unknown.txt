Bright red objects falling from the sky at a high rate of speed.;2011-06-23 22:30:00;40 seconds total;Bright red objects falling from the sky at a high rate of speed. Me and my wife were coming home from the Seattle Sounders soccer game last night and around 10:30pm when we were passing the Lakewood area, I saw red lights dropping from the sky no more than 500 feet off the ground.   I asked my wife if she saw it too and when I pointed out the direction (over Joint Base Lewis McChord), I saw 2 more lights and my wife saw 3 more lights dropping from the same location.  We continued driving discussing what we thought it was and when we were passing the Ft. Lewis/North Fort exit we saw 2 more.  This time it was really close, no more than a mile away and still from what seemed like the same altitude.  I was driving at the time so I told my wife to look up and see if there were any planes or helicopters in the area above us and she saw nothing. We got home and told our story, and my brother in law and nephew saw the same thing except from the driveway of our house, but in the direction of JBLM.  They said they saw between 8 and 11 lights dropping from the same general area. I know for a fact that these weren’t flares because I’ve seen flares being dropped before.  It seriously looked like red shooting stars that only lit up a few hundred feet off the ground before hitting the ground.  It’s really hard to describe these lights but the only way I really describe it is like red traffic lights, lighting up a few hundred feet off the ground already travelling at a high rate of speed downwards before hitting the ground.  No smoke trail and no reflecting light off the landscape where these objects fell. In all honesty, I don’t think these were anything “out of this world”, but these were really strange and I’m posting only because I know it wasn’t only us that saw these lights and hopefully somebody else who saw them reads this with an answer to what these were.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
Faint noise and pressure change.;2012-02-10 03:15:00;30 minutes;Faint noise and pressure change Occasionally I have a restless night as happened on Thursday, February 9, 2012.  I woke up several times that night and it was Friday morning about 3:15 a.m. when I looked at my clock.  I turned over to get comfortable again and settled in when I heard a very faint noise.   At first I thought it might be my own breathing so I held my breath then heard it again.  As I listened it appeared to get louder which is when I realized it was getting closer.  The noise was always whisper quiet and almost sounded like heat going into a hot air balloon but not as harsh.  It was consistent but not rhythmic and not fast.   I turned my head and could not see any light around the edge of the window curtains and heard no noise from the wind chime on my front porch.  At the loudest point (which was not very loud) the house groaned as the air pressure seemed to change like something was passing overhead.   Then noise began to get softer again as it seemed to move away until I cou! ldn’t hear it any more.  When I looked at the clock again it was about 3:45 a.m.   I live in Lakewood, Washington, which is close to JBLM.  Could it have been a military craft or something else?   I’m hesitant to say it was a UFO because I didn’t see anything, but I’ve never heard or experienced anything like it.   Have you heard of any similar experiences?;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
Blueish-green light flying erratically/then was blinking very fast red and went back the other way.;2015-08-19 21:53:00;10 minutes;Blueish-green light flying erratically/then was blinking very fast red and went back the other way My husband and I witnessed an object flying across the sky very quickly with blueish-green lights.  At first I thought it was a drone, but it was too high in the sky and moving way too fast.  It made no sound as it got half way into our view of the sky.  It then stopped for a few seconds, and continued towards us.   It then got to about right above us and stopped again.  Then it moved up and down, and making very erratic movements.   It then started blinking very fast a reddish color and flew very fast back the direction it came from, and off into the distance dropped out of the sky at an alarming rate.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
