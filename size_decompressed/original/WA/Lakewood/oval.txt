White oval objects that chang color from white orange fire back to white also had green haze around them;2012-03-24 16:00:00;15-20 min;white oval objects that chang color from white orange fire back to white also had green haze around them I seen two Oval shaped spheres white in color maybe silver. both had a faint green haze around them both craft turned a orange fire color then returning to original color of white or silver before they burst forward. Before the change in color they almost seemed to be going so slow a plane would have fallen out of the sky if they where planes. First I thought one was a balloon then a seconded one appeared   And I realized they was traveling sideways instead of up and both was on the same flight path. I did get a photograph of one of the objects and I did notice the camera phone did not pick up the green haze around the craft if you would like a copy of the picture you may contact me.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
