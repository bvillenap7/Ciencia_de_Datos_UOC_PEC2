Cone shaped vertical flight path.;2014-01-04 01:00:00;45 seconds;cone shaped vertical flight path Early in the AM of this day (1/4/14) A recent back injury was making it hard for me to sleep, so I was just sitting on the side of my bed staring out of the large sliding glass doors in my room.  For no particular reason I had been looking at this particular cloud for about 2 minutes when all the sudden an object cone shaped with what looked like red, silver and white colored ropes of light wrapped around it which lit up randomly and not any any constant pattern like you'd see on regular airplanes in flight.  Why I'm convinced this was not anything of earthly origin is because its flight path which wasn't vertical like all planes, it just went straight up into the night sky, I didn't hear anything or see any kind of emissions coming from it.  It was visible for a good 20 seconds before it had traveled too far up too see.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
