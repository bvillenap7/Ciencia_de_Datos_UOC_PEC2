I have seen numerous planes and aircraft that can be marked. On a dark, cloudy night, standing outside my open view back yard, I saw a bright flash appear for a moment in the clouds. A couple minutes after the first flash, there was a second flash in roughly the same position. I was not able to see any craft due to the cloudy night, but the flashes pierced through the veil of clouds enough to catch my attention twice. My German shepherd was quite tense during this time, whining and pacing like there was something disturbing them. They react to military scheduled drills like artillery training, and have grown accustomed to them. This event at night disturbed my dog suddenly.;47.1629979591837;-122.528412244898
