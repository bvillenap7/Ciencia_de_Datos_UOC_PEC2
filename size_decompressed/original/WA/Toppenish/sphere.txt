Glowing Orange Sphere over Toppenish, WA.;2012-07-04 21:45:00;35 minutes;Glowing Orange Sphere over Toppenish, WA. On July 4th, in Toppenish, WA my father, mother and I were waiting in our auto for the fireworks display to begin at the local casino.  To the west of us, about 20-degrees from the horizon appeared a large orange sphere glowing brightly, at 9:44pm.  The object may have been 20 miles away.  An aircraft was seen nearby with its flashing lights.  The large orange sphere appeared larger than the aircraft.  My father and I both spotted it.  My mother saw it as well. The large orange sphere just glowed and hovered in place, maybe moving slightly to the right, north-easterly direction.  After one minute it blinked out.  The nearby aircraft moved on to the south-east. 10-minutes later at 09:55pm, the orange sphere appeared again in roughly the same location in the western sky. It hovered for around 2 minutes then blinked out again. 20-minutes later, at 10:20pm, the orange sphere appeared again in roughly the same location.  After about one-minute, it quickly faded out.  There were no clouds in the sky that night. There were many cars around us also waiting for the fireworks, but we did not talk to any of the other people around. The orange sphere was very similar to the one I spotted in Seattle, the 4th of July 2009 over Lake Union.  The glowing orange spheres, globes, balls seem to be appearing quite regularly around Washington State.;46.3773;-120.3327
