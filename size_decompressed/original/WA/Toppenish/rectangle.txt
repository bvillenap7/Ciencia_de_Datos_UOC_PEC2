PD);2007-07-04 23:00:00;5 seconds;Driving south on very dark hwy 97 noticed a bright green rectangler object falling slowly straight down to my west Green rectangular shape fell straight down from sky until disappearing behind a hill. Waited for a flash or some sign it hit the ground but didnt see anything. Looking on a map later revealed a landing strip very near to where it would have hit the ground. Very remote area, very dark area. The object seemed to fall the speed of an aircraft in a flat spin. Not real fast, but definately happen. It was rectangler, horizontal in attitude, bright green, and falling straight down.

A very dark area when I observed suddenly a bright green object falling straight down until it went out of sight behind a hill. It was far to slow for a meteor. More the speed a airplane would be falling if so. Reference was not very good as it was very dark. So distance and size is unknown. It didnt change in size as if going away or towards me, thats how I knew it was falling straight down. Again, I was driving south and observed the object to my W.S.W. When I arrived home I plotted it on a map and have the approximate coordinates. Also saw there is a landind strip about where I observed the object. It sure has me curious. Approximate Location: Lat.46d 13'00 N and Long.- 120d 20'00 W.  Im a ameteur astronomer, I know things are not always as they appear. I also believe life is elsewhere from Earth, but am well aware of the extreme distances it would be from here. I dont think were being visited, Im more afraid it was an airplane that went down, and did report it to the authorities. But I saw something, and would like to know what it was, but probably never will.;46.3773;-120.3327
