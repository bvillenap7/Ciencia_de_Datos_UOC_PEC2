Daytime Sighting in Toppenish, WA;2002-08-12 13:15:00;15 minutes;Daytime Sighting in Toppenish, WA I was in my car listening to music and having a smoke when I heard the roar of jet fighters. I got out to try to see them. I scanned the clear sky and looked the the directions the sound was coming from. There sounded like there were two fighters, one to the east of me and one farther away to the west. I never saw them, however something did catch my eye. I quickly grabbed my Sony FD-95 and took this shot and movie. 8-12-02 12:15PM. This was taken in Toppenish, WA, just east of the Yakama Nation Reservation. This object was visible for about 10 minutes and was moving east. By the time it went out of sight we had at least 15 people watching it.;46.3773;-120.3327
