Three disk shaped objects in photo of Mt. Rainier;2006-07-29 07:07:00;1/640 second;Three disk shaped objects in photo of Mt. Rainier From my residence, I have a nearly unobstructed, other that neighboring apartments in the foreground, view of Mt. Rainier. I have taken many photos in the 11 years of being here. I saw the mountain this particular morning and it had a layer of clouds surrounding its flanks and the early day sun shining on the north side. So I grabbed my Canon 30D and mounted it's EF 75 - 300 mm f4 - 5.6 IS USM lens. I took a total of 4 shots, the first with just a UV filter, then added a polarized filter for the last 3. Then I scrolled through the 4 images on the camera monitor to pick the best one and deleted the other 3. I noticed in the one that I kept, 3 dark dots in the blue sky above the mountain. I have taken many images with birds or aircraft between the mountain and here and when you download into the computer, you can tell that is what they are - either birds or aircraft. Not in this case! These were certainly disk or cigar shaped. I snapped this particular image at 1/640 second and an aperture value of f9.0. The ISO was at 400, giving the 'grain' or 'noise' in the shot. My computer monitor is not that sharp, but I have viewed it on others that were. These also were not specks of dust on the imager, which I would have seen on the other shots. I have showed this to others, whom thought they looked rather odd. I did not physically see these - may not have been able to, given the shutter speed, but then again, it may not have caught my attention at that moment. Mt. Rainier is about 40 Miles away from Fife in a straight line - and these objects, by my guess, were about 20 miles or less from where I took this photo. I have no other explaination for what they are. I can not give a better desciption than this report, being I did not witness these with the naked eye, other than showing up on the camera imager.;47.2315;-122.3592
