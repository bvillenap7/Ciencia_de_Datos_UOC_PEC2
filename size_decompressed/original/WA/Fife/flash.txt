Green/Teal flashing lights seen from Interstate 5.;2016-02-03 19:00:00;15 seconds;Green/teal flashing lights seen from Interstate 5.   My wife, son and myself were driving to church at approximately 6:45 p.m and on I-5 south driving through Fife, WA.  My son who is 3 says, Daddy, they turned the lights on.  I asked what lights, then I looked out to my left and saw a beautiful light green/teal light completely blanket the clouds and sky (It was cloudy and rainy day).  This flash of light lasted for about 3 seconds and happened 3 times from what I saw.   What made it even more amazing is at church, 8 of my friends said they saw the same thing driving to service all from different parts of Pierce County.  Some in Puyallup, some in Spanaway and some in Graham.  Never before seen anything like it in my 33 years, simply amazing.  I'm sure there are more people who saw this as the area was huge.;47.2315;-122.3592
