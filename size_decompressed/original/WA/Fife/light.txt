I saw six bright orange lights in the sky over Fife, WA.;2015-07-11 23:00:00;4 minutes;I saw six bright orange lights in the sky over Fife, WA. In was driving home from work heading through the Puyallup/Fife Washington area by Sterino farms.  I was looking towards the North were I saw 6 Bright orange lights in the sky in an L shape about 3 miles away.   I stopped on the road and tried to take a picture with my cell phone, but it didn't turn out well.  I watched the lights as they moved up into the cloud cover (2800 FT) and disappeared.   I started to drive east bound again and then turned North towards Fife, when I saw another orange light in the sky to the West of me.  I went over the Puyallup River bridge onto Levee road and watch the single orange light circle around behind me before it moved up into the clouds and disappeared.  With my windows down there was no audible sound.   The way the objects moved they looked like drones flying around with a bright orange light on them.  They weren't super fast, just kind of a slow steady movement.  Maybe about 50 MPH.;47.2315;-122.3592
