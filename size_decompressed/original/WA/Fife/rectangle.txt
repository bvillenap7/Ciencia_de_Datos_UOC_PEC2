Black craft daylight sighting with video,;2019-05-18 20:04:00;3 minutes;Black craft daylight sighting with video, My girlfriend and I were driving through Fife, Washington on Saturday, May 18, 2019.  We saw an airplane traveling south to north.  The plane was a large transport type with no windows.  We both noticed something was wrong with the plane.  It didn’t make any noise, but that wasn’t the strangest part.  Neither one of us can say what the problem with it was, but something was off about it.  The plane disappeared over the trees heading north.  I turned my truck towards the south and we immediately spotted a black craft moving strangely.  It was shaped like a cell phone, kind of rectangular.  It was falling like a leaf, then shooting forward for a distance before coming to a stop and spinning.  When it would shoot forward, it would move very fast and come to a stop without noticeably braking.  Just an instant stop.  It would then fall like a leaf again, swaying side to side and slowly dropping, before shooting forward again.  While we were watching this, another ! object appeared.  A silver sphere.  The sphere is debatable.  It could have been a standard airplane light, but it is worth noting, as it is in the video.  I was filming from the side of the road and had to move the truck.  I turned the corner, parked again and could not see either object again.  I saw neither leave.;47.2315;-122.3592
