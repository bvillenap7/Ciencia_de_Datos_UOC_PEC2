My two friends and I were walking thru my hay field when at my 3'oclock I saw a big cigar shaped object. This object was emitting something from its tail (looked like exhaust or dust). I was fortunite enough to snap a picture of this thing with an instant I-zone camera. This thing had lights coming from it and a faint glow on the body of it, and as I said a dust/exhaust thing following it. I pulled out a pair of binoculars from my backpack and when I put them up to my eyes this thing darted across the sky toward the North. There's an Airforce survival school nearby.
