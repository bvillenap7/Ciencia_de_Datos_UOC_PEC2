20 to 25 very bright lights (UFOs) observed at the north end of Lake Washington near Seattle.;2014-04-27 21:00:00;15-20 minutes;20 to 25 very bright lights (UFOs) observed at the north end of Lake Washington near Seattle Orange spheres spotted over Lake Washington, Sunday, April 27th, 2014, at dusk. Five Neighbors gathered to watch a parade of brightly lit perfectly round balls of light float towards us on the north side of the lake.  They appeared singly, then in two and threes, out of the West, then turned to the south and rose up into a large grey cloud, vanishing. The whole event took place in a span of 15 to 20 minutes, finally ending when the traffic to Sea-Tac Airport began flying thru the area. Interestingly, the glowing balls seemed to float or fly up against the wind that we felt on the ground.  At one point they flew like a flock of birds but several stopped still and hovered before continuing up and out of sight.;47.7541;-122.2475
