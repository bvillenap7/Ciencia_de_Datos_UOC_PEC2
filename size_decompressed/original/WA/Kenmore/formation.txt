Kenmore, WA, at N end of Lk Washington near Seattle.  ((NUFORC Note:  Preliminary report from witness.  PD));2014-04-27 21:05:00;10 minutes;Kenmore, WA, at N end of Lk Washington near Seattle. Saw the first ones, around 6, in loose formation coming from the West not far above horizon.  They were VERY VERY bright red orange at first, pulsating and then as they slowly moved south east the became dimmer and turned more whitish. This began about ten min ago and now they are all gone.  Clouds impeding too but they were at first bright enough to glow thru the clouds. Feel free to phone me if u want. Sorry I didn't have a good camera.  There were two others with me who witnessed everything. ((name deleted)) ph 206 355-xxxx  Let me know if someone got them on camera. PS  I was just getting ready to send this when another lone one appeared almost directly overhead for another 5 min or so.  He either went into a cloud or he just totally disappeared...No noise from any of them. ((NUFORC Note:  This is a preliminary report from the witness.
