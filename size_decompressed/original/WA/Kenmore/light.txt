in 2007, I saw a small, white fireball slowly moving across the sky.;2007-07-21 17:00:00;3 minutes;in 2007, I saw a small, white fireball slowly moving across the sky. It was summer vacation, and I was looking out the window, when suddenly, I saw a ball of white light pulsing red about the size of a pea with a hazy aura around it slowly moving across the sky. It was in July, about the 21st, so even at 9:00, it was still light outside. Heck, even at 11:00, there would still be light. Anyways, I saw around 5:00, and the sky was bright blue. In the apartments I lived in, there were lots of trees in the way of the sky. It flew behind two of the trees, and came back out again. Still the same  shape. What in the heck was it?

Orange lights over Seattle.;2013-04-13 21:00:00;3 minutes;orange lights over seattle i saw three orange lights in the sky north of seattle, one on the left and two directly above each other to the right.  As i stepped back inside to grab my phone, i came back out to only the two lights on the right.  The lower light vanished and the last light shot up into the sky. These solid, street light colored lights looked higher than any airplane but way lower than any star.  I looked on youtube for something similar and found the same lights in illinois, I think fla, and also a post from 60 miles north of fresno.   A few weks later i found the exact same lights seen the same day in new zealand.;47.7541;-122.2475

Twenty (approx.) UFOs Observed Above Lake Washington, North East of Seattle, Washington.;2014-04-27 21:05:00;9:00;Twenty (apprx) UFOs  Observed Above Lake Washington, North East of Seattle, Washington. On Apr 28 ((sic.  April 27)), 2014, we observed about 20 UFOs near Lake Washington, Seattle, Washington. Beginning just after 9 pm PDT, we witnessed around  6 bright lights about 30 degrees above the horizon to the south west above the lake.  I live in Kenmore which is at the NE corner of the lake.  The first six were in very loose formation, three above and three below each other.  They started out to be a red orange - orange color and proceeded to move to the east - south east direction.  The further they moved, the whiter they became with less orangish color. After about a minute, several more appeared from the same point where  we observed the others came from.  Over a span of about 5 to 10 minutes, we saw at least 20 of them.  Three or four of them were very close to each other and almost touched at times but most were separated by at least two to five or 10 degrees. Their size was all the same, about 4 times brighter than the brightest star. A few made irregular moves but most just drifted along over about a 3 minute period until they disappeared into a low hanging cloud to the south and east. The last one we observed was around 9:15 pm, alone and at a much higher degree above the horizon, apprx 70 degrees from the South West, close to being over head. It also began extremely bright orange- red and turned white,  disappearing after 2 or 3 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  The sighting event occurred on Sunday night, April 27, 2014.  When this report was first posted, it indicated, in error, a date of April 28th.  We have corrected the error, and will re-post this report with the correct date.  PD));47.7541;-122.2475

On my way to a friend's house, I saw these strange lights on the horizon.  My friend was outside taking something out of his car trunk and I told him to look up at them. He said, Oh wow, look at that!  We kept watching as more of the strange yellow lights appeared from the west and then proceeded south.  There were about 25 to 30 total and the entire event lasted around 30 minutes at which time there was almost no air traffic. One last one showed up above us and then slowly disappeared.;47.7541;-122.2475
