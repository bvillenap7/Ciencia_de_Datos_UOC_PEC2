Oval shaped UFO seen in Kenmore Washington.;2020-07-30 19:10:00;5 minutes;Oval shaped UFO seen in Kenmore Washington. My wife and I were enjoying the view from the hot tub on our back deck.  It was a clear evening and blue skies with no clouds or wind.  Looking SE, I noticed a large shimmering white oval shape silently hovering in a vertical position approximately 400 yards from us at an altitude of around 300 feet.  Its size was about 50 feet tall and 30 feet wide.  I asked my wife to look and see if she saw what I was looking at she said yes. At first we thought it might be a balloon, but it was too big and the wrong shape.  As we observed this stationary object, it began to slowly rotate.  The rotating object appeared to have panels that changed to a darker shade.  I then jumped out of the tub and grabbed a pair of binoculars that were close by and focused on the unit.  Just then the object quickly dropped about 50 feet, and then shot back up to its original height.  This made me put the binoculars down. Just as I did this, I saw 3 or 4 small white lights flash approximately 50 y! ards to the left of the object and it just vanished.  No wind or any sounds were heard during this event.  3 minutes after the UFO left, a low flying military jet flew right over us which seemed odd and out of place with the usual aircraft we see.;47.7541;-122.2475
