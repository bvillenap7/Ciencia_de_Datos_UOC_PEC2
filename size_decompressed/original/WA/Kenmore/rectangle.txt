An enormous craft moved slowly across the sky from west to east.  It looked like a double decker ocean liner with two rows of compartment windows running down its entire length and a string of small lights across the bottom which ran past each other as some moving holiday lights appear to do.  At the time, official sources poo-pooed it as falling space junk, but the object was a unified and coherent field which moved in a straight line across the sky.  I described the object to an insomniac friend who a month or two later saw what I described on an early morning program.  It had been photographed moving across another state (Utah??) The official report this time was falling weather balloons.  I was in a car headed uphill with an unrestricted view of the night sky as it moved slowly across the sky.  We tried to follow it and encountered many others, especially in the kenmore school parking lot who were also watching it. There was radio discussion about it, but I didn't catch any TV or newspaper coverage at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report alludes to the event witness over Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta on Friday night, November 14, 1997.  We have entered that date here.  The event may have been precipitated by a re-entering  Russian Proton 2 rocket casing, but other data in our possession seem to militate against this possibility.  Please see other reports about this event.  PD));47.7541;-122.2475
