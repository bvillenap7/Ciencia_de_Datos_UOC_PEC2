UFO changing colors, shapes and pulsating - Kenmore,Wa 09/09/2011 Video Footage;2011-09-09 23:00:00;1.5 hours;UFO changing colors, shapes and pulsating - Kenmore, Wa 09/09/2011 Video Footage Sep 9, 2011, Kenmore,Wa i noticed a flashing light out my window and off in distance in the night sky as i was laying in bed. i went outside on my deck to get a better look and the object was pulsating and changing several different colors and not flying like a conventional aircraft. The object was to the north east in the night sky. i went and got my son to show him and we both determined this was a very unusual sighting and i should get my camera.  i was able to record the object for the full duration of 60 min dv tape. the object seemed to change shape several times as we watched.  i was video taping with a Canon GL2 DV Camcorder.  Most of the footage was in full zoom of the camera as the object was off in the distance.  I have rendered a 10 min portion of the video down to wmv 256kbps to be submitted for review.  i can submit a copy of the full dv tape at request.;47.7541;-122.2475
