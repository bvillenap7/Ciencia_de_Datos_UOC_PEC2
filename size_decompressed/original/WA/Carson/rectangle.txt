The first words uttered about the object were, Is that a train?. Moments later the bar of light moved out of the wooded treetops and into the sky (it had been in the sky all along, but was merely obscured by the trees). It was a horizontal flat line of light punctuated by several brighter circular points along the line. How distant the object was was difficult to discern, but seemed to be flying lower than the planes in the night sky, and was 5-8x the size in our field of view. It moved slowly from West to East across the sky. It wasn't long before it began to go from completely horizontal to being at a 45-60 degree angle, without changing its trajectory or movement pattern. It was at some point during this transition that I took the photo, wherein you can see the object at around 30 degrees from its horizontal pos! ition. The camera I used was on a new Samsung phone, which has a low light mode that leaves the shutter open for 3 seconds. The photo appears to show a dark outline, possibly illuminated by similar lights on the other side of the craft.;45.7512;-121.8401
