Bright blue ball with big blue flames trailing it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Lyrid meteor.  PD));2018-04-20 03:18:00;5-6 seconds;Bright blue ball with big blue flames trailing it Early Friday, April 20th, 2018, at around 3:15 am, I woke up and few minutes later realized I had left my phone/alarm clock in my car.  I stepped out my door and a couple seconds later noticed something traveling to the East of my home, at first I thought it was a shooting star traveling from N to S, but it turned blue and grew into large blue mass with huge bright blue flames trailing it.   I stood there watching as it descended and slowed waiting to hear the “boom” from it landing in the Cascade Mountains..but nothing.  Not sure what it was, and have not seen any other reports of it.  It was amazing to see.;45.7512;-121.8401
