Bright white ball of light;2012-08-06 23:30:00;2 minutes;Bright white ball of light 8/6/2012 23:30 camping between Mt. Saint Helens and Mt. Adams.  We saw a large bright white ball moving to the north very slow, no sound, no blinking lights.  The object made a 90 degree turn east and increased speed.   After being obscured by trees, two jets came, one from the north, one from south west.   At day light we heard a large helicopter, too low to see because of the trees.  The object was the size of a grape held at arm's length.;45.7512;-121.8401
