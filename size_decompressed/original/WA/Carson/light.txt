A large bright light moved at a constant,very high rate of speed and crossed the entire sky in less than one minute.;2001-05-19 00:01:00;approx 1 minute;A large bright light moved at a constant,very high rate of speed and crossed the entire sky in less than one minute. Two of my friends and I were camping at Falls Creek just outside of Carson, Wa and were watching the stars around midnight.  I noticed a light in the sky that was moving.  I assumed at first that it was a sattelite and pointed it out to my friends.  After watching it for a few seconds, we realized that it was brighter than any other light in the sky and moving at an incredible rate of speed.  It took less that a minute for the light to cross the entire sky and out of our sight.  We were all pretty confused as to what it could have been and tried explaining it, but everything we could come up with didn't seem to fit.  It moved at a constant speed, it didn't fade in and out or flicker, which a meteor would do, and moved far too fast to be a sattelite. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We are not certain whether the witness means the night of May 19, or the morning.  PD));45.7512;-121.8401
40-100 star sized white lights moving in strait line, evenly spaced, moving south to north.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-16 18:40:00;15 minutes;40-100 star sized white lights moving in strait line, evenly spaced, moving south to north. We observed a continuous moving, perfectly strait, line of star/satellite sized lights moving south to north a little slower than a commercial airliner flies.  They appeared out of sight behind a few trees, then traveled roughly 24 inches across the night sky, then disappeared suddenly into nothing. My girlfriend and I lost count after 40 of these lights, we estimate there were closer to 100. We were completely sober and lucid.  We were driving through Gifford Pinchot National Forest looking for new snow camping sights. The lights disappeared completely when a commercial airliner got close.;45.7512;-121.8401
