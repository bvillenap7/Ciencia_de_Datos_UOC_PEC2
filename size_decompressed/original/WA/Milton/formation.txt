A few of us saw a reguar jet heading into seatac airport, My hephew said no no t that and repointed us to the correct location. We saw about 15-25 white shapes in the sky. They were moving in a western direction from our standpoint, ne to nw to our perceptin. I would say starting about the direction Issaquah, WA to end well over the Wa peninsula in just 3 or 4 minutes. I stated they looked like the you tube video over mexico city. After losing sight of them we went into the house looked up the event on the computer and everyone stated YES! that is what we saw. Some of the people were in amazement of the same thing that they just saw being recorder in that you tube video.;47.2478;-122.3154
