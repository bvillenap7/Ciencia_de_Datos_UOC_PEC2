Object was significant size.  Can't remember if it was blinking or not.   Honked the horn at my sister who was driving her car in front of my car at a stop sign at the top  of the hill on the road that goes from Fife to Milton.  She drove off leaving myself alone with the Ufo.   I rolled my drivers side window down, but could not hear a sound.  I was fearful yet curious and stayed there until it completely passed over the trees.  I wish I would've known about this network at the time of the sighting.   I was sixteen years old.  On that day my family and I were moving from Shasta Lake CA and arrived at my sister's apartment which was the location of the sighting.  The most strangest thing I've ever seen in my lifetime.   I can't recall the date since it's been so long but I know for sure it was in June of 93 at about 2 am.   The reason I write now is to find out if anyone else had similiar sightings in the same time frame and maybe the same location? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
