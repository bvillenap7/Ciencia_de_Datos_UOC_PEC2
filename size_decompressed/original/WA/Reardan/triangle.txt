Large bright golden triangle moving rapidly from west to east near zenith then suddenly vanishes.  ((anonymous report));2016-07-29 22:35:00;2 seconds;Large bright golden triangle moving rapidly from west to east near zenith then suddenly vanishes About 10:35 pm, on the night of July 29, 2016, I stepped out into my yard with the dog.  I moved around the corner of the house into darkness to look at stars.   A few seconds after I began skygazing, a bright metallic golden wedge shape appeared from the west, moving very fast.  It struck me immediately how large and well defined the shape was, and how fast it was moving, at about the apparent speed of some faster meteors.   At about the time it reached due south of me, it winked totally out as if it were reflecting the sun which had set a couple of hours prior.  It seemed to be traveling due west to east and was 10 to 15 degrees below zenith.  When it winked out, it was gone - it apparently had no lights, and made no noise and was not on fire nor falling apart.   A jet was traveling to the  northwest at high altitude in the same area of the sky, its lights blinking regularly, but I couldn't see any sun reflecting from it.  The jet moved much much more slowly th! an did the UFO, on the order of 20 times more slowly. I am at 47.9 lat x 117.7 long. What was it?
