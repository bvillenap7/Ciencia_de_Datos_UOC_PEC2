White oval light in night sky then vanishes in Reardan WA.;2016-04-01 21:00:00;5-8 seconds;White oval light in night sky then vanishes in Reardan WA. April 1st around 9:00pm, my sister and I were driving on Highway 2, going west from Spokane, WA.  We reached the small town of Reardan, WA, and we were nearing Cedar Street on Highway 2, when we both noticed a white orb above, move or wobble across the night sky.  Reardan Grain Growers Elevators are located straight ahead of us on the right of Highway 2 and we were about 4 city blocks east of the elevators.  The white orb wobbled and seemed almost even with the silhouette of the elevators.  Then shot directly straight down and disappeared.   Startled at what we saw, we took a right and drove around the elevators near the railroad tracks and saw nor heard anything.  When we went back onto Highway 2 to continue west, we saw several cars pulled over on the side of the road.  The driver was talking to the other driver.  We wished we had pulled over and asked if they had seen what we saw but we were in such confusion that it was hard to wrap our brain around it. What was most unusual about this experience was the size of the white orb, how close it was to us, how fast it moved straight down and how silent the whole experience was.  If my sister had not seen the same thing I would probably have denied myself believing what I had seen. (NUFORC Note:  The source of the report is well known to NUFORC, and we hold her in very high regard.  We suspect that she is an exceptionally reliable witness, and that the sighting occurred as she describes above.  PD));47.7054;-117.8663
