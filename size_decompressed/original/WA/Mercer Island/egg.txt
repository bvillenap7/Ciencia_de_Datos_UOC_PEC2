PD));2012-11-29 23:00:00;10 minutes;Colorful object flying over Mercer Island I was driving home and the road was completely dark.  Suddenly a colorful flying object drew my attention.  It was an oval shape with green, red, blue lights flickering on.  It was flying very smoothly.  It was also faster than a plane.  I stopped and watched it for about 10 mins.
