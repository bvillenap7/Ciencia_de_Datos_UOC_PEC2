Huge Plane Hovering for Many Moments or More, Big As Football Field.;1995-06-01 21:00:00;Long;Huge Plane Hovering for Many Moments or More, Big As Football Field Driving west on I-90, I looked up at Mercer Island well before the tunnel.  To see Mercer, I looked across the other opposite lanes of traffic and up above a hill.  I saw a the hugest plane imaginable.  It seemed larger than a football field. What I noticed most was that it was actually hovering, stationary, for several moments while I drove. It seemed like a plane. It was not square like a football field, but more angular like a huge triange. I saw one.  Anyone on the freeway could have noticed it. The color just looked like a plane, some neutral off white, grey or silver I guess. It remained there the whole time I drove that strip of the freeway, which was many moments, and maybe a minute or more. I don't remember hearing any noise from it. I was in my 30's, with a Master's Degree in Information Science.  I was on my way to go two-stepping in Seattle.  I tried marijuana and hash in college a few times, over 10 years prior. No other drugs or addictions.  I should have turned around and gone back, but the person I loved was waiting for me in Seattle for a good night of clean fun.  I did not report it because I assumed hovercraft had been invented while I was cloistered in college and graduate school.  I assumed a plane that large was not unheard of.  It never occured to me that it could be UFO until I checked with my acquaintences who work at Boeing and they assured me they did not have planes like that.
