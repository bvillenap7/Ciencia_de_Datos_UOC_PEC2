We both saw a faded green oval descending from west to east. It moved slower than a shooting star, but faster then a plane. The green color was a faded green as if it were behind a cloud that never went away. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports.  If the object was a meteor, 8 seconds is a long time for a meteor to be in the atmosphere, although not impossible.  PD));47.5601;-122.2326
2 white ovals, 1 chasing the other above cloud level, odd flight patterns;2006-10-24 22:35:00;10-15 seconds;2 white ovals, 1 chasing the other above cloud level, odd flight patterns I parked at a local Walgreens:   (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=7707+Se+27th+St,+Mercer+Island,+WA&ie=UTF8&z=14&ll=47.58932,-122.234831&spn=0.025355,0.10849&t=h&om=1 ) at 22:35 on 10/24/2006  and as I was getting out of my car I noticed two completely lit white ovals moving through the sky, roughly southeast to northwest in the northern part of the sky.   One was kind of following the other, but I couldn't notice at the time whether the second was following exactly, or just very similarly.  At any rate, what struck me was two things - the height and the pattern of flight.  The height struck me because they definitely were above the cloud level.   I'm still trying to figure out what the could level was at that time, but it gave me the impression that if they were as high as they seemed, then they were pretty large.  I first saw them going in a straight line, then the first one curved around the left and came back just a bit, then continued left, then forward, then right back to the original path.  It then sort of seemed to wander in that direction until it disappeared over the clouds.  The second was doing basically the same thing, if not exactly the same thing, but about a second or two delayed after the first.  I left my car door open and ran towards them to try and get a cleared look, and shouted out, UFOs! in the north sky! a few times.  Frustratingly, no one was around until someone parked about 10 seconds after they went over the clouds.  They got out and I told them about it and they immediately got back in their car and headed to a park on the north side of the island to get a better view of the sky.  I also did this, but we didn't see anything at that point after about a half hour of looking up.  They must have already gone.  I'm sending a 5 minute MS Paint illustration - sorry, it's pretty ugly!
