Yellowish red lights over Lake Washington 6/14/2011;2011-06-14 21:30:00;10-15 min;Yellowish red lights over Lake Washington 6/14/2011 I was driving south on I-405 from Redmond to Puyallup and to the right of the freeway was over 10 yellowish red lights.   I took the next exit and saw 3 cars pulled over on the shoulder of the exit.  I tried to get to a spot with an open sky view and found one that was only slightly obscured by trees.  I watched them go behind the treeline and they didn't come out the other side.  They seemed stationary or moving very slowly.  It was hard to tell because the sun was setting.  I couldn't see the shapes of them but they all had the same steady yellowish-red light and made no sound.  When I got home, I tried to find something online to explain them but found nothing.;47.5601;-122.2326
Large saucer-shaped ball of light discharging orange sparks.;2016-06-10 04:30:00;3 seconds;Large saucer-shaped ball of light discharging orange sparks I am the opening guard at my pool.  I was pulling the pool cover outside when a large saucer-shaped light shot across the sky overhead, arched, then headed south after discharging orange sparks. It was so bright it lit up the sky at 4:30 am.  Like a shooting star, only very close to the ground.  Like 30 ft from the ground.  It was super fast too.  And was gone surging 2-3 seconds.   It made no sound during its flight.   Very spooky.;47.5601;-122.2326
2 moving objects in sky. 30 sec. apart from each other, suddenly stopped, moved around in a pattern and flash off. ((anonymous report));2018-07-17 12:45:00;30 minutes;2 moving objects in sky. 30 seconds apart from each other, suddenly stopped, moved around in a pattern and flash off into sky. At Luther Burbank park having a night swim, observed what we thought was a satellite traveling very quickly across the night sky.  It suddenly stopped, moved to an almost infinity pattern and then a huge flash of light like 10x of a normal stars brightness and was gone.  Not more than 30 seconds later I observed another UFO traveling West, but this was more of an erratic movement than the previous UFO.  It stopped suddenly, seemed to move up and down and flashed even brighter than the previous one and was gone from the naked eye.  My boyfriend and I were screaming, “What did we just see?“ over and over again.  We got quite. 10 minutes later we spot ANOTHER object in the sky moving at high distance, stopped between two stars and seemed to be moving up and down, almost like a ping pong ball and then just stop.  It stopped moving for 15 minutes and then would very slightly look like it was falling down and catch itself and move in the same star position as before! Very Very active over on Mercer Island this early morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.5601;-122.2326
