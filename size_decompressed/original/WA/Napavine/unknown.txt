There were a few people ahead of me and a few behind me, i wish i could know if they saw this too.  It was a very clear night out. So when i went to admire the beautiful night sky i thought i saw a shooting star.  I took a double glance and couldnt believe what i was seeing.  It was lower to the ground is what first caught my attention, then i noticed that the craft had slowed down to wear it was so slow it almost just disapeared and then took off really fast leaving an unblievable, luminous green trail behind it.  I have always been the type of person that did not believe in aliens or ufo's or whatever lable you would like to call them.. but after seeing what i saw, i now believe that there are others out there.;46.5756;-122.9012
