Blue/white light slowly fading and disapeared, resonant humming observed.;2008-02-03 18:58:00;30-45 seconds;Blue/white light slowly fading and disapeared, resonant humming observed. Object was Blue white in color, fairly bright in intensity. Heading from west to east flight path curving slowly varying north and south. The light faded slowly, may have appeared slightly red and then disappeared. While still in open sky , no cloud cover. Just faded out..... (as usual). Also observed was a low humming sound not unlike that of an airplane engine. The humming sound continued perhaps 20 to 30 seconds after object became invisible. The sound seemed to resonate in the air,ground and trees. While I am hesitant to compare the sound to a conventional aircraft I will include that information anyhow, be assured this was not just a Cessna with it's landing lights on, cessna's do not disappear in open sky. I have observed this type of light/object in the area before. Object was Somewhere north of Avery Road west. Possibly over Napavine. I would estimate altitude between 20 and 30 thousand feet if not higher. These types of object can be Observed in the area, relatively frequently.;46.5756;-122.9012

While she was speaking she was looking up she noticed a small blue light moving south to north. It was extremely high altitude. it traveled at a constant rate and direction , fading out into space over about a 10 second period. Another one was seen about 3 or four degrees farther west about 2 or 3 minutes later fading out similar to the first one. Small blue lights. extreme high altitude. scraping or leaving the high atmosphere.;46.5756;-122.9012
