Three lights between Waitsburg, WA and Burbank, WA.;2012-07-31 22:30:00;20 minutes;Three lights between Waitsburg, WA and Burbank, WA. I was driving from Waitsburg, WA toward Burbank, WA in the evening and saw three large lights in the sky off to my left.    There were two red and one that was white and blue flashing.  I could not see the shape of what the lights were on, but the tail end red light seemed to change distance from the other two lights.   All were very close together and did not seem to move quickly.   I cannot tell the distance because of the darkness and not being able to see the actual craft shape.   They were in my sight on and off for 30 minutes, disappearing out of sight right outside of Burbank off to my right.;46.2693;-118.1497
