I was looking east, the blue light lasted about 3 seconds. I thought it was a quiet helicopter (no sound) it only appeared to be about 1000 ft up. The night is clear and the stars appear higher. It traveled about 1000 feet and then disappeared. I step outside and could not see anything in the sky. Like I said, I thought at first it was a helicopter and then a shooting star and then it vanished. It was low, slow, blue and didn't go very far.;47.793;-117.3072
