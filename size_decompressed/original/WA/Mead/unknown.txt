30 satellite like objects flew over house in under 15 minutes.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-17 21:30:00;15 minutes;30 satellite like objects flew over house in under 15 minutes 13 miles north of Spokane WA in the village of Mead:  Between 9:30 PM and 9:45 PM my wife and I observed over 30 satellites or something that flew over our house from WWS to NNE.  It might have been a military flight but there were no marker lights and the speed and altitude seemed to be the same as other satellites we have seen over the years.  We could not discern any shape as they appeared to be bright shiny satellites.  Weâ€™ve never seen anything like that before.;47.793;-117.3072
