Huge triangle ship, with two smaller ships.;2017-05-19 17:49:00;15-20 minutes;Huge triangle ship, with two smaller ships. While camping at Ancient Lakes, we first saw what appeared to be a single flashing white orb moving erratically, with some sort of beam that circled around the orb with various colors.  After about 5 minutes two additional white lights appeared that created an extremely large triangle with the first. At that point, the original orb seemed to be shining spotlights at the two additional lights, eventually creating an outline of the entire ship.  Shortly after, two additional smaller triangle ships appeared to the north and east of the large ship. This remained in the sky for approximately 15 minutes.  During this time our cell phones did not have service, then the service came back before morning.;47.1988;-119.8426
