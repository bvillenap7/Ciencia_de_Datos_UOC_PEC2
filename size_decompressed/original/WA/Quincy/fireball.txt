White fireball.;2015-02-22 18:14:00;5 seconds;White fireball. At 6:14 tonight, I was driving south on highway 281 out of Quincy, Washington.  I noticed an extremely bright light plummeting toward earth at about a 30 degree angle.  Whilst driving I noticed that the object was white hot, or at least it seemed with a dark area in the middle of it.  It actually reminded me of the movie Empire Strikes Back when the probe droids are shot out of the Star Destroyer in the beginning of the movie.  I thought for sure there would be a huge impact, but at the last second, the object leveled out so that it was horizontal to the skyline and just above the mountain range.   It then seemed to glow brighter and brighter then shot off towards the SW in the direction of Mount Rainier.   There was quite a few people pulled over on the side of the road I'm sure wondering if they might witness it again.;47.1988;-119.8426
