Flashing oval object sighted in Fall city;2012-01-25 23:30:00;30 Minutes;Flashing oval object sighted in Fall city It was a perfect oval that would flash a white bright light every two, to three minutes.  Sometimes it would be a red/white flash.  Also when it flashed you could see 6 or 7 perfect circle lights, that made the oval shape when they flashed.  The object never moved out of its spot for the half an hour.  It was no where near any city limits, and even if it was it was way to high in the sky to be anything from a city. The fact that the object stayed in the exact same spot proves that it was not a plane.  The flash would happen so fast you would have to concentrate in order to see it.  There was sometimes when the light would flash extremely bright, and other times not as bright.  I found a video from someone recording a ufo sighting during the day, and the ufo would flash the exact same as what i saw.  Same time duration and same exact circle lights forming the oval shape.  Sinse it was dark for me, all i could see was the flashing lights.;47.5682;-121.8896
