yellow/orange fireball leaving debris trail;2006-10-01 20:18:00;2 seconds;yellow/orange fireball leaving debris trail I saw a yellow/orange fireball, about the size of a quarter moon. The fireball was traveling from west to east. There was a large trail and what looked like debris tumbling from it as it fell.  It was a clear night with a half moon visible.  I had just watched 2 satellites pass overhead within the previous 10 minutes.  There was a small private airplane in the immediate area as the object passed through. Total time of the observation was approx 2 seconds.  The object made no noise. I have seen fireballs in the past but never one that left a trail like this one.  The trail was so unique that my first thought when I saw the object was that an airplane was on fire and that pieces were falling from it. I am a former Army pilot with almost 1000 hours of flight time.;47.5682;-121.8896
