Possible abduction experience.  2 witnesses remember glimpses of inside of craft.;1975-03-01 08:00:00;6 hours;Possible abduction experience.  2 witnesses remember glimpses of inside of craft. This was reported to Peter Davenport late afternoon of this day. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to submit a more thorough, detailed report.  Date of alleged incident may be approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF ORIGINAL REPORT))  Hi Peter, I submitted a report to you some years ago about a possible family abduction in Fall City, and I wondered why I never saw the report online. I was scrolling through the old reports for Washington today and found this, and I think it's mine. http://wwwnuforc.org/webreports/042/S42459.html The date should have been 3/1/1995, not 1975 This is the experience my friend, my 2 youngest kids and I had.  It was the experience where we did not wake up until after 2:00 in the afternoon, all very disoriented.  I had remembered being in a craft going straight up through the clouds in the daytime.  I called you around 5:00 that evening, spoke with you for a while and you gave me the phone number for a lady, I don't remember who she was or what she was affiliated with, but she in turn gave me a phone number for a hypnotherapist who does regressions for abduction, her name was ((name deleted))and she lived in Woodinville. And then 2 days after this happened my 4 year old daughter told me about going up in a 'sky car' and seeing 'sharks'. So yeah, 1995 not 1975! Thank you!
