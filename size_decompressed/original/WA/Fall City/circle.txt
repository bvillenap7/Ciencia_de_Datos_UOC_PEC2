Orange fireball flying West in Washington State on July 4th.;2010-07-04 21:34:00;5 min or so;Orange fireball flying West in Washington State on July 4th. We witnessed a quarter size (from where we were standing) circular fireball that was orange in color.  It kept a steady straight pace.  It almost looked like a plane that was on fire, however, there were no noises (engines) and as it flew further away from us it dissipated.  It was flying west.  If I were to compare it to the moon, I would have to say it was about the same size.  There were four of us shooting off fireworks at the time.  It just disappeared after about 5 minutes or so;47.5682;-121.8896
