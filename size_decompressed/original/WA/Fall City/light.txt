Two lights brighter than Jupiter, one above the other, suddenly disappeared.;2004-03-28 19:45:00;10 seconds;Two lights brighter than Jupiter, one above the other, suddenly disappeared. While reviewing the more recent reports, I noticed a report of anomalous lights seen in Renton, WA, on 03/28/04.  My 16 year old daughter and I also observed these lights.  I was setting up my telescope in our front yard to observe Saturn when my daughter asked me to look at two stars behind us.  I turned around (facing NNE)and saw through the trees what I thought were two very bright stars, one above the other, very near to Polaris in the sky. The apparent magnitude of both was brighter than Jupiter.  I began to reposition my telescope away from the tree branches and when I turned both stars were gone.  My daughter reported that they both had just vanished.  I am a former Army aviator and these lights did not appear to be either flares or conventional aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the lights might have been landing lights on distant aircraft, although the witness, an aviator, seems to have ruled that out.  PD));47.5682;-121.8896
Extremely bright, steady  light moving across night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of ISS.  PD));2006-08-26 21:30:00;~ 10-15 seconds;Extremely bright, steady  light moving across night sky. My two sons and I plus our neighbor's son (7,5,6, respectively) planned to watch the sky for meteors on that Saturday night.  We live in Fall City, a small rural community about 25 miles east of Seattle in the Cascade foothills.   We set up a tent, got our sleeping bags, pads, snacks, etc., and waited for dark - we had planned this for the previous week or so.  The moon is dark and sky was beautifully clear.  We were having a great time - saw 2 satellites and at least two shooting stars.   At about 9:40 p.m., my 7 year old declared that he was tired and went into the house.  About 5 minutes later, my 5 year old yelled look at that light (not star.)  The neighbor boy and I looked to the Northeast and saw a large, intense, white light moving from NW to SE.  The light was far brighter than any stars in the sky and was moving at a very deliberate pace - it took the light about 10-15 seconds to cross about 2/3's of our field of vision i.e. from the time we saw it until it went behind some adjacent trees.  I could not tell how high it was, but it appeared to be quite high up.  There was no sound whatever and we live in a very quiet area.  At first I thought airplane.  But as I observed it, I came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane, certainly not any airplane I had ever seen before.   The light looked round and about the size of a BB if you hold it at arm's length.  It was a very clear, very steady white/blue color.  It did not blink, flicker, or attenuate in any way.  I was very impressed with the steadiness of the light.   It moved, as I noted above, very deliberately. That is the only way I can think to describe it.  The speed didn't appear to vary and it didn't appear to turn or change course in any way.  I know this must sound like a terrestrial aircraft of some sort, but I don't believe it was.   It was like a very large star moving through the sky, very bright, very intense, very very impressive.  It was not a meteor, at least not like one I've ever seen before.    I am a geologi! st and have spent a great deal of time in remote areas and have observed the night sky constantly.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I do not drink or take drugs, ever.   My son and his buddy saw the same thing and we compared notes afterward.  I looked at my watch just as it went out of sight so that I would have a time reference.   I am really interested to see if anyone else saw this object.   This was a cool experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of ISS.
