Eight very bright red orbs in Northeastern sky in verticle formation.;2012-08-18 21:00:00;10 minutes;Eight very bright red orbs in Northeastern sky in verticle formation. At about 21:00 I witnessed 8 red shinning orbs in the Northeastern sky.  They were verticle and appeared to be about 2 to 3 miles from my location.  They were from maybe 500 feet off the ground to about 1/2 mile in a line formation from top to bottom.   They moved just slightly to the left or right.  Then they started to dissappear, first 3 were gone instantly.  5 were left for a few more minutes then 3 more dissappeared which left the 2 lowest ones.  The sky had a few thin clouds nearer the ground and bright stars in the night sky covered the area.   This was in Eastern Washington near the town of Elk. The red light was very bright and large.  Had a camera but couldn't get the flash off so the pictures did not turn out. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this individual, and she sounded to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a skilled and reliable witness.
