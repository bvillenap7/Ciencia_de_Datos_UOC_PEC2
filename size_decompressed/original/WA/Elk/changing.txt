I bright light appeared to be hovering 500 feet above the ground.  we noticed it a bright white light at first and we could tell it was spinning. we notices random flashes of tiny light appear and disappear all around the craft. after a couple minute we would see it make slight movements to the right and left. we had the idea to shine a flash light at it. immediately after flashing the light the aircraft began changing color and stopped spinning. we all thought it was focusing on us. we notice it slightly coming closer to us foot at a time. we watched this hovering craft for an hour and a half before we couldn't bare the coldness anymore.  I have never seen anything like this is my life.  I've always heard stories about UFO sighting but I've never put much care into it... whatever we saw last night, saw us to. when the craft floated closer we felt a different presence in the air.  a heavier feeling.  A shop light on front of my friends garage flickered off for a few seconds and flickered back on when the craft started slowly getting farther away.  I was terrified but something about this thing in the sky had all of us drawn in. the horses in our field were acting up and getting scared. i think somebody needs to check this out;48.0186;-117.2924
