Two dark orange balls moving eastward over Sunnyside WA, Yakima County.;2010-04-13 22:15:00;15 seconds;Two dark orange balls moving eastward over Sunnyside WA, Yakima County. I saw two dark orange colored balls come from an area that was obscured by a tree and travel eastward.  At first one was behind the other, and then they moved to side by side. I initially thought it was one of those spotlight things like at a car dealership, but this is in the country, and there are no clouds.  It wasn't moving particularly fast, and I perceived them to be rather low.  I don't know if this was caused by what I saw, but there seemed to be some noise, as if from a glider. I'm not exactly a UFO believer, I just would like to know what just flew over my house.;46.3214999999996;-120.015599999999
