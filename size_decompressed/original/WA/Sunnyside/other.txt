I were in the car pulling up with my mom when she said there was a ufo in the sky.The ufo was northwest about 2-9 miles nw of sunnyside. It made no noise or movment. It had two triangles on it the bottom pointing up and the top pointing down each corner of the triangles had a light. There was a glitery chain inbeetween the triangles.It was sort of lit up and I could see metal is what the triangles were made of. I were scared and ran in the house and told my dad to take a picture but it was gone by then.

Weird white line seen in Sunnyside, WA.  Video taken. 8/22 at 20:05.  ((anonymous report));2017-08-22 20:05:00;5 minutes;Weird white line seen in Sunnyside, WA.  Video taken. 8/22 at 20:05. Driving on my night route as a medical courier, I took my exit to go into Sunnyside, WA, (exit 69).  I noticed a weird white line in the sky.   At first I thought it was a cloud break, but the more I kept looking at it I came to realize that it just didn't fit, it was a cloud break.  The sun was red (due to all of the smoke from recent fires) and was on the horizon.   When I got to my stop, I watched it, and realized it was moving slowly.  I then took a picture and video.   Youtube link:  https://youtu.be/uvi8jPMNKCg    The white line was indeed moving very slowly, and eventually faded away. Later on in the night around 10pm around Prosser, WA, I did see some flashing orbs, but can not confirm those because I was driving and could have been a reflection of my van's windows.  But it was in the same Northwestern sky.  Thank You. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));46.3214999999996;-120.015599999999
