Bright light over Yakima Valley in about 1978;1978-09-01 19:00:00;60 seconds;Bright light over Yakima Valley in about 1978 We were on the hill North East of the city of Sunnyside,Washington. There were four of us and I don't remember Who it was, But they looked up and said, hey! look at that falling star and we all looked up and it was a bright falling star, we thought heading right for us.  Then as it dropped closer to us it was actually a few miles to the south west at about the center of the city of Sunnyside. I thought it would hit and then it slowed down and stopped about a half mile above the city. it stayed there about 20 seconds to the best of my memory. We started to kid around and said things like, You see that?.....No, I didn't see anything...You...no not me  Then in the blink of an eye it was over Mabton, about 6 miles to the south of Sunnyside. The light still in Sunnyside then followed to Mabton. Almost like the flash of a sparkler when you Swing it around in the dark during the fourth of July as a kid. Same light anyway, then after another 20 seconds or so it shot toward Toppenish and arched up into the sky till is blended into the stars and was gone. One guy joined the Air Force later after High School and I have never talked to him about it, maybe some day. He did want to know more about what we seen that day. (This was a very bright round light, like a florecent only brighter) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));46.3214999999996;-120.015599999999
3 bright red lights clustered together,  at first thought airplane, no running lights or no sound, flew over Outlook Wa. and headed for;1997-06-20 00:35:00;5 min.;Summary : 3 bright red lights clustered together,  at first thought airplane, no running lights or no sound, flew over Outlook Wa. and headed for Hanford. I was driving my truck, going to Toppenish Wa. just passed Outlook Wa. and in the southwest I saw 3  bright red lights clustered together, for about 30 sec. I kept driving, I stop the truck, got out, I watch the 3 clustered lights as it headed northeast  and it started to gain altitude, I thought a first this was a airplane or helicopter, but it made no sound or no running lights, very little traffic at 12:35 am.  Speed was about 35 to 40 mph,  then, it started picking up speed, at about that time it was over Outlook Wa. About 80 sec. had passed, I watch it as it headed for  Hanford Wa. a total of about 5 min. had passed since I first saw the ufo, I was about to lose sight of it,  the lights started to pulsate, the lights were very bright now as they pulsated. then I lost sight of it. I'm guessing it was about 30 miles away.the radio and tv tower lights  near Yakima Wa. is about 25 miles and I could see them very  clearly;46.3214999999996;-120.015599999999

This was so strange to us we have never seen anything like this. it was a bright yellow light almost like a star shape (bethlehem shape) The lights would line up in a line and then at an angle it was so strange.  we called 911 to report and the had many calls and were checking into it.  We also called a local news station to report but we haven't heard anything back yet.  it is now 10:00 p.m. and we have seen the lights since 9:00 ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We do not understand why the witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate, given that she submitted the report on the same date as the alleged sighting.

I saw two orbs of light and they started moving and then one disappeared and then the other disappeared;2018-02-14 23:00:00;3 minutes;I saw two orbs of light and they started moving and then one disappeared and then the other disappeared I was driving and I thought it was only a light reflection and then the light started to move east but it looked nothing like an airplane and was way to low in the sky to be a shooting star.  The light was about 3,000 maybe 4,000 feet in the air I estimate.  One of the light disappeared and then one kept going for a while and then disappeared.;46.3214999999996;-120.015599999999
