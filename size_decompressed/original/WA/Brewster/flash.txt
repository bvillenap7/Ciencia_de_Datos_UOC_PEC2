Very Large Red Flash Object lasting 2 seconds;2004-10-25 10:45:00;2 seconds;Very Large Red Flash Object lasting 2 seconds UfoCenter, Seattle, Washington  Re: Description of Large Fireball Flash in Sky.  I was driving north on Highway 97 at Brewster, Washington when I observed a very large red flash in the sky which lasted about 2 seconds.  The observation was spectacular as the object exploded into a purplish red bright flash with bright yellow tail glow.  The object started from the south-southeast heading going to north-nothwest.  I called 911, at Okanogan, and reported it about 1 minute after my observation as I thought it noteworthy.  I have never seen anything at night from personal observation as spectacular. ((NUFORC Note:  We were first apprised of this alleged event by the 9-1-1 center in Okanogan, Washington.  The witness asserted that there were other vehicles on the road at the time of the event, whose occupants, almost certainly, would have been witness to the same event.  The Okanogan newspaper was apprised of the event.  PD));48.1225;-119.7692
