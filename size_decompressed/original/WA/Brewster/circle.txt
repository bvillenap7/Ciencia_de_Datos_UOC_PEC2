Appeared to be about the same height as an airplane, but looked much bigger and was traveling much faster.  Light got progressively dimmer as it appeared to travel away until fully out of sight before it had the chance to disappear over the horizon.;48.1225;-119.7692
Bright, white hot light or reflection off the sun, silent, not moving, old or circular shape.;2021-07-29 23:30:00;ongoing;Bright, white hot light or reflection off the sun, silent, not moving, old or circular shape. My wife came and two grandchildren sighted the object and after watching it for awhile came in to see if I could explain what it might be.  I went outside and observed a bright dot in the sky near the sun at around 11:30 am PST.  At first I thought it might be a drone, just hovering.  There was very little wind, if any.  Quite hazy as we are in the middle of a smoke out because of nearby forest fires.  The only conclusion I could make is that it might be a highly reflective balloon.  It hasn't moved in over a half an hour and that seems unusual.;48.1225;-119.7692
