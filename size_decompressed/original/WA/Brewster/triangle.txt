It made no noise or had any lights and vanished as it vanished as it passed my door  My dog actually growled at it as it passed by I swear to you this was not a figment of my imagination and is not a lie i was not seeing things and it could not be anything other than what i saw  i have never seen any other UFO in my 58 years of life;48.1225;-119.7692
