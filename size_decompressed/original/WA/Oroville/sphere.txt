Bright round saucer, stationary, red lights on right, over Oroville, WA;2010-10-02 17:00:00;2-3 HOURS;Bright round saucer, stationary, red lights on right, over Oroville, WA Saturday night, October 2, 2010, at 7:30 PM Ted and I saw another UFO in the SE sky, the first one since our first & only sighting three years ago.  The light was huge and artificial, compared to the 3 trillion stars in the CLEAR sky that Saturday night.  We watched the  BRIGHT light through our binoculars for 1.2 hours until we had to go to bed. The bright object was shaped like a saucer with a large bright dome on the top. When it rotated, it was shaped like a sausage. There were three red lights on the right side.  The UFO did not change location and did not make any noise for 1.2 hours. The bright object was not a plane, not a flare, not a helicopter, not a satellite, not the moon, nor a star. Ted and I both saw and agreed on what we saw.  We were both sober, of course. :-D  I took a photo just in case I could catch a shot with my little camera. The light does, indeed, show up on my computer with contrast enhancement.;48.9401;-119.403
