Saucer shaped object heading north over Oroville Wa.;2012-06-11 20:00:00;15 seconds;saucer shaped object heading north over Oroville Wa. I was laying outside looking up at the sky, when I noticed an object shaped like a saucer going across the sky.  I was looking to the east and it was traveling north.  I couldn't judge the size or the distance it was from me because there was nothing to compare it to.  It was silent and I was only able to see it about 15 seconds.  The shape was like a saucer with a ball in the middle.  The center was very shiny with the saucer shape being gray. (I don't do drugs and I don't drink0;48.9401;-119.403
