Went from very fast to full stop above us. Went silent then reved up and moved away slowly.UFO was 3 to 4 ft long and above me and my father about 15ft.  Came back one year later at near same time.  My brother was home alone and heard the chickens going crazy, looked out and saw a shadow circling on the ground.  He went outside with a 22 rifle to get what he thought was a Hawk.  Said he was on a hill and the hair stood up on his neck, he felt like he was being watched, he then looked up and saw it 4 to 5 ft away from him. It was never seen again ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));48.9401;-119.403
