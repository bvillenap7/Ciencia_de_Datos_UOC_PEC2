Bright Triangle Accompanied by 3 jets.;2004-01-11 21:15:00;10 minutes;Bright Triangle Accompanied by 3 jets. My husband and I witnessed a very large bright light (larger than Venus in am) moving moderately from North East to South West. It was accompanied by 3 blinking red lights which we decided were jets because we could hear their engines. The jets did not stay in any formation with it but moved around craft. When it was directly overhead we realized that it was a triangle shape.  After it reached a certain point South West of us it apparently turned (trees were in our way) and began to head in a West to East direction. At that time we lost sight of it.;48.9401;-119.403
