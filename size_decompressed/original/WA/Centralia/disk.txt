Missing time coinciding with eyewitness reports.;1990-10-12 00:00:00;36 hours;Missing time coinciding with eyewitness reports. I was home alone and completely sober on a Friday night in Oct. 1990.  I went to bed.  I woke up around noon, and my mom was doing laundry, something she usually did on Sundays.  I asked my mom why she was doing laundry on Saturday.  That's when she told me it was Sunday.  I couldn't understand how I could have slept 36 hours without once getting up to use the bathroom. I asked my mom if anybody saw me the day before.  She said that she thought that I was in my bedroom and wanted to be left alone and that my car was parked outside the whole time. I can't explain how, but my life took on a completely different path after that day.  I know things that, but i can't explain how I know these things.  Something happened, but I don't know what.  Our home was behind the hill next to the airport that Kenneth Arnold took off from on the day he encountered his flying saucers.;46.725;-122.9677
