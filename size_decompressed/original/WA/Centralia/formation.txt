V formation of 7-9 white orbs moving quickly beneath the moon;2021-03-25 21:00:00;5 seconds;V formation of 7-9 white orbs moving quickly beneath the moon In Centralia, WA around 9pm I was on my way outside and looked up at the sky. It was cloudy, but I distinctly saw 7-9 glowing starlike orbs traveling south to northeast dipping under the moon. They were in a v like formation with the center point leading like a flock of geese. It seemed to me that they were their own entities. I thought they may be shooting stars at first but they were traveling too slow for that. It lasted about 5 seconds. My friend who was on the other side of the yard also saw the same thing.;46.725;-122.9677
