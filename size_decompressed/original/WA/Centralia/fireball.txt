Silent flickering yellow orb that moved from the North and dissapeared into the East above the city of Centralia, WA at dusk 21:45 pm.;2012-07-18 21:45:00;1-2 minutes;Silent flickering yellow orb that moved from the North and dissapeared into the East above the city of Centralia, WA at dusk 21:45 pm. I was watching Ancient Aliens tonight (ironically) and went outside to get my kitty Sam.  I go outside at dusk every night to bring him inside.  Hes an old kitty so I usually hold him for a while and watch the sunset/rising stars before I go in for the night.  So tonight I looked up and about directly above me but a little lower in the sky, to the North, I saw a flickering yellow/golden orb.  It was moving in a sporadic, shifty manner towards the East.  Kind of flickering and bouncing as it went.  It seemed to have an aura to it that caused the flickering effect.   There was no sound and after about one to two minuets, it disappeared slowly, like a candle going out, into the eastern sky.  At arms length, it looked to be about the size of the tip of my thumb, a little smaller than a dime.  It dissipated silently into a pinpoint. Maybe it was a flare?  I just never saw a flare that went up into the eastern sky.  I'm excited, this was my first UFO sighting. Thanks for your time.;46.725;-122.9677
