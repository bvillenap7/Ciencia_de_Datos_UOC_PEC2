Glowing object flies west to east over I-5;2011-09-20 22:00:00;5 sec;glowing object flies west to east over I-5 walked onto balcony looking east toward I-5 , came from behind me headed east VERY fast, rectangular or cigar shaped Glowing a white color with tinge of blue/green like a fog around it, it had to been doing 1,000 mph and in complete silence only visible for about 2-3 seconds, i see planes fly all the time here but they always travel north-south with I-5 always. this thing flew from west to east, no blinking lights, I've seen meteor's before and definitely not a meteor, I'm no nut-so... I have always said I'm open minded about religion vs aliens and just awaiting proof from one or the other.... this was proof for me!;46.725;-122.9677
