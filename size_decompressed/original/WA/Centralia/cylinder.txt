Thought it was fireworks because of the holiday, but  it headed south in a straight line, then made a V-pattern to the east.  It went back to the original line it was traveling on, then stopped.  After stopping for a few moments, it continued and stopped again, and did this one more time.  It then made what seemed like a 90 degree turn, directly away from me, into the upper atmosphere and disappeared.;46.725;-122.9677
