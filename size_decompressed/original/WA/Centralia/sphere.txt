Magenta fog after Seattle Lights sighting;1997-11-14 21:12:00;3 minutes;Magenta fog after Seattle Lights sighting On November 14, 1997, as I was driving on I5 North toward Seattle, I witnessed an unbelievable sight.  There were approx 16 lights/fireballs that were twisting and turning in 2 parallel lines that resembled a BI Plane.  The size was massive and as the lights spun around, they emitted a white flame with orange red smoke.  Some cars on the freeway pulled over but I was too mesmerized and stunned. They were slow moving and were visable for at least 3 minutes.  After they had passed, I drove through a magenta fog for approximately 1 mile.  It was beyond comprehension.  2 and half hours after the sighting, I experienced severe stomach cramps which resulted in projectile vomit of ten feet.  ((personal items deleted)) I have never told this information before except to a few very close friends.  Sorry for such a late observation but felt that no one had communicated such a personal observation. ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports of this incident, which the U. S. Space Command reported as a re-entering Russian booster.  PD));46.725;-122.9677
3 white orbs traveling southbound near I-5 come to complete stop than dash away - I noted the event on Twitter.;2010-07-08 22:50:00;10 seconds;3 white orbs traveling southbound near I-5 come to complete stop than dash away - I noted the event on Twitter. My roommate and I were traveling home on I-5 northbound and were somewhere between Centralia and Rochester, WA, Thursday evening, July 8, 2010.  At approximately 22:50, while in the car, I saw 3 glowing white orbs hovering just above the treeline very close to the freeway. The size of each orb was fairly large, I'd estimate them at between 10 and 20 feet in diameter.  The three orbs all seemed to be similar in size.  They made no noise I could hear from the freeway. Each one glowed with pure white light. Within the span of seconds, the three orbs came streaking from seemingly out of nowhere across the sky, towards us from the north, then came to a complete stop, hovered momentarily just above the treeline, then dashed away very quickly towards the south. As soon as the orbs had sped away from us, my roommate, who was driving said, Wow, did you see that too?   We then had a conversation confirming that each of us had seen the event. I decided to submit this report after reading a local news article regarding the same event.  A unique thing about this sighting is that after getting home, I noted the sighting on twitter.com.
