Mysterious Red Light Seen Right Outside Bedroom Window;1996-12-20 03:26:00;30 seconds;Mysterious Red Light Seen Right Outside Bedroom Window Around 3:30 am a few friends and I were beginning to doze off after a long-gossip session in my bedroom.  We were arranged slumber-party style, with me and a friend in my bed, and two others on the floor in sleeping bags.   My bedroom is on the second floor.  My back was towards the large window, facing the expansive lawn of my rural home.   Suddenly one of my friends started shrieking, what the....!!!!  We all turned towards the window.  A pulsating, orangish-red light was shining into the window.  It wasn't exceedingly bright, however, it was exactly level with the second-story window.   I glanced back at my alarm clock for some reason, but there were no numerals displayed--the power was out.  The flashing light lasted for about 30 seconds.   We were screaming the whole time (as teenage girls do) so I'm not sure if any sound accompanied the light.  Unfortunately, as we were so frightened, we did not look out the window to locate the source of the light.   Finally, my father,  awoken from his sleep with our screaming, came to my bedroom.  We recounted the story.  He insisted it had something to do with the transformer that lies at the far edge of the lawn.  He went outside to investigate, and found nothing amiss with the transformer.   After this sighting, my friends and I experienced a few other similar sightings over the next few weeks, cultimating in a sighting (also late at night) where the lights appeared to be coming from the side of the house.  This time, they were so bright that a light that turns off at sunrise outside my house turned off.   Although we didn't see an object, I feel that these lights are so unexplanable, as to constitute a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));46.725;-122.9677
