I was just driving eastbound on I-90 just outside of Easton, WA, when cars in front of me started to break for some reason, then I saw why.  In front of me kind of on the right hand side hovering between the trees was a round object with really bright red and orange lights, I only saw it for a moment and even got a second look at it. I knew for a fact it wasnâ€™t a plane or helicopter or weather balloon in that case. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous provides e-mail address only.
