It turned color with the sunset, and did not move. Right before sunset, we were doing s'mores at a resort in Lake Chelan, WA and we noticed the first star.  I had my binoculars and noted it was was a white doughnut-shaped object.  I thought it might be a balloon, bit it remained perfectly still, not moving with thin clouds or the moon.  As the sun set, the color of the doughnut changed orange, then red (suggesting reflected light from the sun) I would have chalked it up to being a balloon, except for how still it remained for a rather long duration.  My whole family looked at the object through binoculars, and could see it with naked eye as a star, until the sun set, then it got dimmer, and could only be seen as it changed color with the sun's rays through binoculars.  At least 2 passenger jets passed by in the near vicinity, but I could not tell relative altitudes.;47.8438;-120.0335
