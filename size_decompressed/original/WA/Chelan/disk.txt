Pinkish/Grayish saucer shaped object over Lake Chelan, Washington;2012-01-21 21:35:00;1 min;Pinkish/Grayish saucer shaped object over Lake Chelan, Washington I was taking my dog outside to go to the bathroom and was looking up in the sky admiring how beautiful the nightsky is and I spotted a saucer shaped object that was grayish/pinkish in color gliding through the air.  It was huge, from where I was on the ground and judging how high it was in the sky I would say it was maybe the size of 3 city blocks big. It had no lights or anything that would normally draw your attention to it, it was more like a silhouette against the night sky. It made no noise and simply glided through overhead. I would never have noticed had I not been looking up right at it.   It was only partly cloudy this evening and the stars were out where you could observe them, the moon was nowhere to be seen.;47.8438;-120.0335
