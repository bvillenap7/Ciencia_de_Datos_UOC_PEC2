Sphere's moving slowly in formation;2001-08-11 19:30:00;35 min.;Sphere's moving slowly in formation First there were 5 Sphere's,3 white and 2 pink. When I first spotted them they were in pyrimad formation with the 3 white sphere's on top and the 2 pink on bottom. As I watched, the formation slowly drifited apart and more white sphere's appeared. At one time there were 10, all white except for the 2 pink. They were as close as they came while there were ten. They moved very slowly and moved up into the clouds. They would move in and out of the clouds as the clouds drifited by. They were so high airplanes would fly under and not be close. There numbers droped until I could only see 3. These last 3 moved slowly over my head until they left sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a contact telephone number that appears to be disconnected.

two spherical objects of differing physical features above mountlake terrace.;2014-09-01 13:00:00;20 min;two spherical objects of differing physical features above mountlake terrace We witnessed two spherical objects in the sky.   There were two hawks trying to scare them away, but gave up.  One sphere was very tiny compared to the hawk, and appeared to be just a black dot moving amidst the clouds.   The second sphere came about 10 min later, appeared to be metallic and reflective of light.  It was close enough to see it was completely round and was not a balloon with string.

((HOAX??))  Flying red and orange round lights in sky.;2016-02-22 20:00:00;10 minutes;Flying red and orange round lights in sky I was standing outside and looked up and saw a red and orange light that was lovely slowly.  I watched it for a few minutes than it disappeared by just hovering and then slowly the light was gone.  I immediately saw another round light moving sideways and then followed by another light shortly after.  I saw about 6 of the lights and watch a few disappear.  I recorded on my phone and took pics.  The photos do not do the real sighting justice at all.   I'm not sure what these things were but I've never seen anything like it ever.;47.7941;-122.3066
