Lynnwood  W.A.  spherical with lights;2001-07-09 22:30:00;10 seconds;Lynnwood  W.A.  spherical with lights I was coming home from work last night at about 10:30 P.M., had just come off the feeway and was headed down my street, when I looked up to my right and just above the treelines I saw what I first mistook as the Seattle Spaceneedle. It was spherical and had multi-colored lights along the base that were chasing each other, and it had a red ball on the top. The body was dark, and I didn't see the underside of it because of the treeline. I realized a split second later that it couldn't be the spaceneedle because that particular building is about 15 miles away, and this  sphere was between 1/4 and 1/2 mile away. I had my windows cracked open because it was a warm night, and I don't have a radio in my car, but I didn't hear anything that sounded mechanical or electrical. As I went down the road I lost track of it in the treeline. I didn't see it take off, but as this happened within a couple blocks of my house I went to go get my husband, and after I located him there was no sign of it. I would be very interested to know if there were any other reportings for that time and dates;47.7941;-122.3066
Large low hovering disc.;2017-10-27 08:45:00;1 minute;Large low hovering disc Very large circular flat disc with little greenish lights flashing hovering in one spot.  Looked hazy around the object.  No sound!  It was very low and very big!!!  I was driving, and we stopped to stare at it in the middle of the road.  This thing was huge!  We turned down the residential street to get closer and it was gone!  We drove around and around and nothing! Craziest thing Iâ€™ve ever experienced!  My friend and I could not believe it!;47.7941;-122.3066
