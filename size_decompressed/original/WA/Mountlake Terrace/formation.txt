Yellow/red strange lights in V shape.;2014-11-28 19:00:00;30 min;Yellow/red strange lights in V shape. Started as a line of 3 lights with a forth appearing to the right.  Lights shifted with some increasing in height.  At times shape appeared in a V, the a square.   Lights quickly disappeared then re-appeared on top and next to each other.  I obtained pictures and as a recording.  Most of the time there were three large ones with fainter lights then appears with 7 at most.  Lights would disappear immediately, most simply hovered, but would elevate and then drop back to the horizon.   I was able to get images that included aircraft versus lights and street lights, all clearly very different than the lights in question.  Not all lights would show on camera and video.  Upon zooming other lights I didn't see by eye did show, I believe these may have been aircraft in the distance approaching the lights.  Lights appeared to be toward Seattle area but not directly over the city which is 20 miles south of me.;47.7941;-122.3066
