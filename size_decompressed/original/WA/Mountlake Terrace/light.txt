White, still object several miles up, disappeared & reappeared 10 degrees east, disappeared again.;2006-06-29 10:30:00;5-10 minutes;White, still object several miles up, disappeared & reappeared 10 degrees east, disappeared again. It was a mostly sunny morning, high, thin clouds.  I was reclining on the back porch talking on the phone when I saw above the high clouds a white object.  It wasn't a lit up, but rather must've been a white surface.  It was not moving as fast as the clouds were, almost still.  It must've been several miles up, very far away, since I was not able to make out a shape at all.  I got off the phone and continued to watch it when it disappeared right in front of my eyes.  I was surprised at that.  Then, a few moments later, about 10 degrees east, it reappeared.  It stayed in that position for a few minutes.  I looked away for just a moment and looked back and it was gone.  I searched the same area of sky to make sure my eyes weren't just straining and it was definitely not there anymore.  After several minutes of searching the rest of the sky I was sure that it had gone, at least from my sight.  It was definitely not a weather balloon or traditional aircraft.  I was perfectly coherent and awake. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.7941;-122.3066
Bright Dot Hovering on Clear Day;2009-06-10 16:00:00;15 minutes;Bright Dot Hovering on Clear Day On June 10th, 2009 at approximately 4:00 p.m.  I was standing in the parking area of my condo complex in north Lynnwood, WA. I was looking east to the clouds starting to creep out of the mountains toward the lowlands. As I was looking at the clouds, I briefly the scanned the blue sky above them and noticed a bright object about 45 degrees up due east of where I was standing. The object seemed to change in brightness and had slight movement in its seeminly fixed position but I wasn’t sure if that was just a trick of the eyes. I proceeded to watch the object for any movement for about 10 minutes and noticed that it had slowly moved southward during that time. My neck was getting sore from staring at it so long so I went into my house to grab a towel so I could watch it from a grassy slope nearby. When I came out, I spotted the object again at about 80 degrees so it had moved westward. My stepson and neighborfriend arrived and I pointed it out to the both of them. When the neighbor’s father came out, I acknowledged him and told him what we were looking at but when I looked back up to find the object again, I was unable to locate it. I watched it for about 15 minutes but it appeared to be at a good enough distance to only be a bright dot in the blue sky. The skies were clear except for the clouds that were over the mountains and the temperature was in the mid 70s. The area it appeared above was Mount Lake Terrace. While it was fairly distant and hard to relocate when you took your eye off of it, I doubted anyone else would have seen it or reported but am curious if there are other reports of an object in that area yesterday.;47.7941;-122.3066
