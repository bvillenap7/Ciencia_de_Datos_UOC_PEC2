Green ball of light (10 to 20' in diameter) traveling west at about 200-mph, altitude 500', towards Edmonds.;2003-01-08 19:33:00;3 seconds;Green ball of light (10 to 20' in diameter) traveling west at about 200-mph, altitude 500', towards Edmonds. My nine year old son and I were traveling west in our car when both of us noticed a green ball of light traveling west, in a straight line, at about 200-MPH at an altitude of about 500', right above us.  We lost sight of it in only a few seconds because it went over a hill heading towards Edmonds.  It was a solid lime green light approximately 10' to 20' in diameter with no trailing light / tail.  What we saw had no structure, only a ball of light.;47.7941;-122.3066
