One very bright light in one location moving from slightly from side to side for about an hour then faded out;2004-01-30 19:30:00;approx60 minutes;One very bright light in one location moving from slightly from side to side for about an hour then faded out I walked outside my front door at 7:30 pm on friday night to get something from my car, I looked up and noticed a very bright star shaped object hovering in the western sky but this object was much too close to be a star, it seemd to be about 5 miles away at about a 45 degree angle. I watched it for about 1 minute to see if it would change locations it did not, but I did notice it move slightly from side to side then I went back inside my house and asked my 15 year old daughter to look at it and see if I was mistaken.She watched for 30 seconds and noticed it move, she was very frightened by it and went back inside to call her friend. At this point I had to call my friend to tell him because I new he would be verry interested. I told him what i was seeing and instantly he and his wife got in their car and drove down to the beach to get a close up view of the light. The area they drove to was west of my house and below the light. When they arrived at the beach they could see the same light I was watching. At this point my wife and 12 year old daughter returned home from picking up dinner she asked what was going on and I told her, they stopped and looked at it and also noticed its movements and agreed it was not a star. My 12 year old daughter ran inside the house frightened, my wife was speechless. The bright light did not change locations for 40 minutes. During this time we watched the light fade in and out as if it were traveling away from us and returning but after talking with my friend at the beach we agreed the light was revolving around the object, It soon faded out ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is very prominent in the western sky, currently.  NUFORC receives many reports about it.  PD));47.7941;-122.3066
