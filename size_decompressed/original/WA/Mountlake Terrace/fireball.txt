I saw through my window, looking north, an unusually bright white/blue light, trailing a red tail.  At first I thought it was falling and I would soon hear a crash.  I heard nothing and later realized it could have been high in the atmosphere, going north. It appeared to be the size of a quarter, if extended to arms length, with a red tail at least four times its diameter.  Very colorful.;47.7941;-122.3066
