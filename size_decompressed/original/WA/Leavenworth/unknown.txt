Leavenworth Wa. on Boundary Butte  UFO sighting;2012-08-11 22:25:00;40 minutes;Leavenworth Wa. on Boundary Butte  UFO sighting UFO sighting report Leavenworth WA. Saturday 11 August 2012 Between 22:25 and 23:10 We were at we were up at Boundary Butte which is Township 24 N by. Range 17 East.  This is a big viewing area because you’re up at 3,000 feet.  We were looking west up the Icicle drainage right at Mtn. Cashmere and then a light came on we both saw it.  Time on deck was 10:25 and like 30 seconds.   We kind of knew we were going to see something we just didn’t know what?   Along this road there were many other groups of people up there to view the Perseides comet show   I don’t know if any of them saw it but it was like you could not miss it.  I hope the other groups up there will add to my story or share their own. Ok when we both confirmed that we were both seeing what we were seeing.  We were both looking west by south west a little.  The light moved to the east right out in front of the Butte up a maybe two thousand feet away or so??  It flew to the end of the Butte or maybe a little further and made a U turn to the north came around to the West again and headed over to Icicle ridge and flew over the ridge top out of view.  Let’s get this straight there were no sounds of airplane or helicopter or identification markers for Port and starboard not sounds at all.  Just one light and with binoculars I could not see a shape. Then we were looking south about 11:02 ish, towards Mt. Stuart.  All of a sudden there was a light on in a black area of the sky so we both saw it.  Then it the light got a little brighter and switched or morphed  into a plane and headed east towards Wenatchee kid of in the flight pattern our commercial planes fly in the fly over sound was added in by them and it was more faint we feel.  We watched till flew out of sight which was like 2 or 3 min.  The lights and blinkers after I watched and thought about it the rate, at which the blinkers were flashing at, seemed faster and the light itself was sharper of a blink.    If that makes sense??   Sorry no pictures nothing really to take a picture of to black out..;47.6412;-120.6718
