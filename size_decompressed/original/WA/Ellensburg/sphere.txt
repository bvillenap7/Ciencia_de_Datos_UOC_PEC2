3 spheres circling around then moving to the west.  ((NUFORC Note:  Daylight sighting.  Not advertising lights.  PD));2013-07-13 17:00:00;5 minutes;3 spheres circling around then moving to the west Around 5PM I stepped out the back door onto an alley facing east, I was having a cigarette and looked up and saw three spherical objects moving around.   They were going around in a circle moving in and out from each other, they were faint in color almost becoming invisible then becoming solid again and glinting in the light.   This went on for a few minutes then they started to move off to the west in a line then into a loose V pattern.   I followed them as far as I could see them until they were lost in the sunlight.
