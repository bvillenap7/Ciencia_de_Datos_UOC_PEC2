It then suddenly took off to the east at extreme velocity. We went out to look at some real estate just east of town on a clear summer afternoon. My wife, brother-in-law and sister were there. We had just finished looking at this home and were outside looking up at a lot of gnats just twenty feet in the air, when my brother-in-law said look! I said yeah I see the gnats, but he said no, farther up in the sky. Then I focused my eyes much farther up and saw a small silver sphere which hovered in one spot. As we (my wife, brother-in-law and myself) were watching, this small sphere suddenly at break-neck speed moved in a staight line towards the east of the valley. It was as though as soon as we noticed this thing, it decided to leave! I am a medical technologist and also an Army reservist. My wife is a homemaker and my brother-in-law is a disabled veteran. We are all in our forties and have never witnessed anything like this before. There was no exhaust trail or flashing lights. We didn't see any other spheres or aircraft in the sky . There was no sound. I initially thought maybe it was a silver birthday balloon, but what I don't understand is why it stood directly overhead and didn't move, then all of a sudden moved at an extreme velocity in a straight line and was out of sight in about 3 seconds. We didn't report the sighting to authorities because we were still wondering about it. I did tell some of my co-workers friends and relatives about what we saw. We didn't have a camera or video camera at the time of the sighting.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068
