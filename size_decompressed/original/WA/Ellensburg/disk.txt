3 orange light with a fog around it and another with a  disc shape with the lights white.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-05 23:00:00;Night time;3  Orange light with a fog around it and another with a  disc shape with the lights white Was driving from Yakima wa to Seattle when I pass over the last hill seeing Selah, WA, is when I seen 3 big lights just hovering next to the highway.  The lights looks like to can make up one ufo, I could tell it was big base on the fact that I can  notice the  semi trucks  on the other side of the valley to compare it to, so I speed faster trying to see what was that, I know other people seen it too because they had pulled over.   As I pass the next hill I couldn’t see it till it came out of no where again next to the freeway, but the  opposite side where I last seen it but that’s where I can  see it more clearly of 3 lights (Orange  Color Like a  peach), that’s where other cars was starting to slow down from 70mph to about 25mph, but then it seems to have gone over the hill again, the light seems like there was a  heavy fog around the lights as if the fog was the ones making it light up.  as I gone once more over the last hill when u get the see the beautiful town of  Ellensburg.  I couldn’t spot it no more, and was trying to wrap my head around on what I just  witnessed.   As I kept driving and wondering the big question, I seen the ufo  no doubt, was a different light, a straight light  of lights (white) behind the trees, I  near crashed   And trying to keep my eyes on it, and slowed down again but lost it and then again as I stop, just gazing at it as if it was all true, the classic looking  disc shaped ufo, others I seen it too as I rush for the last time to the exit to thorp wa (the town after Ellensburg, WA), it was out of site.  On top of each hill where the lights come over, I notice 3 Cars stop as of they had lost power to there cars and the last hill I seen a  semi truck  With its hood open and power off ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
