Triangle/Boomerang shape over Ellensburg--University Way area;2007-03-07 22:15:00;30 seconds;Triangle/Boomerang shape over Ellensburg--University Way area I was sitting watching TV when something caught my eye outside in the sky through the window.  It was a large triangle/boomerang shape very low, with blinking white lights, and moving very strangely towards the southeast.   I watched until it passed over my house, then I ran outside and saw it continue slowly towards the southeast.  There was no sound at all.   Suddenly it dropped even lower and changed direction toward the north, and slowed down.  It seemed to hover or move very slowly, moving north until it was blocked from my sight by buildings and trees.   I called the police but no one had reported anything.  I can’t believe no one else saw it, since it was in town, flying right over streets.   I'm not good at determining altitude, but it was definitely flying too low, too slow, and too quietly for any type of plane or aircraft I know of.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068
A large, triangle shaped UFO spotted in Ellensburg, WA with three solid white lights and one flashing red light.;2012-03-12 19:45:00;approximately 10 minutes;A large, triangle shaped UFO spotted in Ellensburg, WA with three solid white lights and one flashing red light. I wish I reported this sooner, but I didn't wanna make a big deal out of it considering no one would believe me even if I told them. The date was Monday, March 12th, 2012 around 7:45 P.M. to 7:50 P.M.. The sun had set and it was dark out, but not quite pitch black. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and you could see the stars and the moon easily. It was one of the nicer evenings. I was driving down Robinson Canyon in Ellensburg, Washington, on my way back from my step sister's house headed home to my house about 3 miles from where I was. I was listening to the radio at the time, and remember checking my watch at around 7:45 P.M. to make sure I would be home by 8:00 P.M., when my mother wanted me home. I looked up from the watch, and looked up into the distance. There were 3 bright, white/yellow lights in a triangle formation above and to the left of the long, straight road I was driving on. It looked as if it was traveling towards me. I continued to drive a little further. As I approached the aircraft, I looked around and there were no other cars on the road, so I stopped my car, turned off the radio and got out of the vehicle to see if I could hear any noise from the aircraft, there was literally no noise at all.  No sound of a propeller, no sound of a jet engine..nothing.  The night was completely silent.  The only thing I heard was the noise from my car engine (which isn’t very loud anyway), and I figured that if it was something with an engine, I would be able to hear it over my car’s engine considering how low it was.  Judging from my experiences flying through the valley, it was probably at about 3,000, 3,500 feet AGL.  It was moving so slow that I could only tell that it was moving from references on the ground, but it was not hovering. I stood there on the road next to my car watching it for about 4 or 5 minutes, until it was directly under where I was stopped on the road. I looked up at it and could barely make out the shape of the aircraft. It was in a triangle shape. There was one red, flashing light underneath and in the center the aircraft, and 3 white/yellow lights on each tip. The white/yellow lights were not flashing. I sat there for another 2-3 minutes watching it, when a car started approaching me from the distance on the road. I decided to leave. I thought maybe it was just an aircraft from the local military base, doing a test flight of some sort, so I decided to not to think much of it.  I got back in the car and drove off, about thirty seconds after I started driving, I looked back in my rear view mirror to see if I could see it, and it wasn’t there.  I looked behind me, it was gone.  I stuck my head out the window to see if it was behind my car, and not in my line of sight, I still couldn’t see! anything. The night sky was completely clear. It literally had disappeared.  The lights were gone, (I thought maybe the operators turned off the lights because they knew I was watching or something) and I could not even see the shape of the aircraft anymore, I couldn’t see the aircraft at all.  I do not know what this thing was.  I assumed it came from the Yakima Training Center, most likely a test aircraft of some sort.  But I, being the believer that I am, strongly believe that it was something “not from this world”.  That night when I got home, I told my siblings and mom what I had saw.  Of course they didn’t believe me. I decided to just keep it to myself. Also, at the time the thought never occurred to me to take a picture.  After I got home that night, I deeply regretted that I didn't.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068
Bright yellow orbs in a triangular formation with blue and red lights flying close to the ground in Ellensburg, WA;2012-09-05 00:46:00;3 minutes;Bright yellow orbs in a triangular formation with blue and red lights flying close to the ground in Ellensburg, WA We were driving home and saw three very bright gold orbs in the sky that looked like a streetlight at first.  We pulled into a dark park and turned the car lights off and then saw the craft moving close to the ground (but above the trees) and moving very fast.  It had blue and red lights on the underside of it.  As it got closer, you could tell that it was some kind of craft and we knew that it was foreign as it flew over top of us.   Then we saw a second one going the opposite direction and a little bit faster and then it was nowhere to be found.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068
Large, silent, light-absorbing black triangle seen slowly propelling parallel to the ground in Ellensburg, WA.;2015-04-07 21:00:00;5 seconds;Large, silent, light-absorbing black triangle seen slowly propelling parallel to the ground in Ellensburg, WA. Tonight, April 7, 2015, at approximately 9:00 pm (PST), I was walking west down the street, when I happened to look up.  I saw a black isosceles-shaped object approximately 15 feet wide with 3 whitish/yellowish lights at the points.   The object was completely smooth, made no noise and seemed to not reflect light.  The object was approximately 20 feet in the air, slowly moving parallel to the ground towards the east.   Although I never took my eyes off of the object, it suddenly disappeared after close to 5 seconds of observation.   There were no nearby trees or buildings behind which the object could go. It just vanished.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068
