OVAL UFO IN KITTITAS VALLEY;2002-05-22 23:05:00;15 minutes;OVAL UFO IN KITTITAS VALLEY I was coming home from the store tonight. It is fairly light out tonight so there are not many stars in the sky. I was heading north on the road towards my home, when I noticed a light out of the corner of my eye. I turned and watched it accelerate greatly towards the north. Then it stopped instantly and just hovered. This object may have been up to 10 miles away or so. I watched it and continued to my home (It still just hovered). Then I called a friend out of the house to look at it. She thought it was odd as well so she got the binoculars. We both took turns looking at it for about 5 minutes, then it suddenly disappeared then reappeared at a high altitude. Then in slowly dimmed out. It was oval in shape and was giving off a red/orange/yellow pulsing tone. There was also aircraft activity in the area and we compared what they looked like from a distance and could not get a match. Also I would like to note that I have seen several other objects and have a weird one on tape as well.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068
Large oval metallic and shiny looking object in the sky Between Ellensburg and Yakima near the military training center in the morning.;2020-10-05 08:00:00;20 seconds;Large oval metallic and shiny looking object in the sky Between Ellensburg and Yakima near the military training center in the morning. I was driving to work early in the morning from Ellensburg to Yakima around 8:00am in th morning when coming down Manastash Ridge approaching the military training center east side of the freeway I82.  I looked up and sighted a large oval shaped metallic object in the distance in the air.  Suspended and not moving at all.  I was looking for chemtrails or smoke from exhaustion as if it was a plane and didn't look like a helicopter cause helicopters can't fly that high.  I watched it for several seconds then it just vanished into thin air.  I looked for it and could not sight it again.  There were no other vehicles near me while I was driving so Im assuming there were no other witnesses.  The weather was blue skies with no clouds at all.  I know I saw something but can't explain.  I went to work and told co workers and one said he had seen something also early in the morning, which tells me others have seen it and Im not going crazy.  thanks for listening and ! understanding.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068
