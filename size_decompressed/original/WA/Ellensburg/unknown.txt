Flashin-and-lights;2000-11-14 20:15:00;5 to 15 minutes;Flashin-and-lights I drive truck 4 times a week from Pasco Wa. to Seattle Wa. on NOV. 14th of 2000 a co- driver and myself were travling west on I-82 about 7 miles outside of yakima when we saw a bright and brillant flash of light in the sky to the N.E. We had both made a comment about the flash. Not thinking to much about it we drove on without saying to much more. We continued to drive until we hit I-90, at about exit 109(about 15 miles from where we saw the flash)my partner told me to look, do you see what i think i see! looking toward the direction he was pointing i saw very clearly 3 bright lights that seemed to be connected in some way hovering in the sky. While i continued driving he watch the lights in the sky. He then told me that there was 2 sets of lights, when i looked i saw both sets of 3 lights in the sky. Before looking back toward the road the set of lights that were to the bottom left of the original set had suddenly disapeared. As i drove on he said holly sh** the other one just went straight upward into the cloud cover. Thats the last we saw of either craft. One of the strange things about both the flash and the sets of lights we saw, is both the instances caused the C B in our truck to quit working.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068
