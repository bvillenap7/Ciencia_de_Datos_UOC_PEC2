10/10/1998  Bright white light moving very fast;1998-06-01 10:00:00;8 seconds;10/10/1998  Bright white light moving very fast I saw a large spherical very bright white light at low altitude 3-5 thousand feet moving very fast in a straight line at level altitude from the nw to the ne.  I began counting second out as soon as I saw it as it was moving so rapidly and counted eight seconds before it went out of view on the horizon.  I was just outside Ellensburg and estimate when I first spotted it, it was near Cle Elum heading toward me.  I counting immediately and got to eight when it was gone over the Columbia Basin past Vantage.  I estimate the distance I watched it travel to be at least 25 miles approaching and 25 miles going away from me.  It had no tail, just a very bright white light and totally silent.  It passed by me just a little to the north and east of where I was standing. I have been a passenger in small planes on several occasions here and live near the airport so have witnessed countless small planes over the years and know how to approximate their altitude.  This did not vary in altitude at all.  It was flying flat and level all the way. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Sighted one small bright light moving right and left quickly while ascending.;2001-11-15 23:25:00;3 minutes;Sighted one small bright light moving right and left quickly while ascending. There were 7 of us out hunting coyotes a good distance outside of Ellensburg. Up near the Manastash Canyon. On our way out of the canyon we stopped one last time to listen for coyotes when we noticed a bright light come up over the ridge. It was fairly small and moved slowly. We thought nothing of it until it started bouncing from left to right quickly. It would move right fast then pause then move left. As it moved side to side it was slowly rising up. After about 5 minutes (a guess) it just stopped, slowly sunk below the ridge again. We then proceeded to get out of the canyon as fast as possible! We will be going back on 11/16/01 to try and photograph the UFO if possible.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068
Three bright lights northeast of Ellensburg WA;2011-04-11 22:00:00;4 minutes;Three bright lights northeast of Ellensburg WA At about 10 p.m.,  April 11, 2011, a friend and I were driving east on Game Farm Road near Ellensburg.   We both noticed what appeared to be three bright horizontal lights low hovering above the road east of us.  The lights were like very bright car headlights. I was driving and when I turned onto Game Farm Road, the lights were there.  My passenger said, What is that?    Since the airport is about 2 miles away, at first I thought at first was a small plane coming to the airport.  But since it did not appear to be moving, I quickly ruled that idea out. The lights were there for at least 3 or 4 minutes (for the time it took for me to drive from Phenning Road to Wilson Creek Road).  We turned north on Wilson Creek Road and the lights were still low in the horizon to the east, appearing to be very near and low. The lights disappeared suddenly after a few seconds. I did not see the lights again, but have been thinking of them since wondering what I saw.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068

Orange to red immensely bright circular moving light.;2014-05-06 21:00:00;5 minutes;Orange to red immensely bright circular moving light. On Tuesday, May 6, 2014, my brother, nephew and I were headed thru the Ellensburg, Washington, hills to Yakima County.  It was approximately 8-9 PM. While traveling my brother whom was driving asked, do you guys see that, what's that light?  On the left side of the hills about a mile away was this massive orange, reddish almost circular light.  We couldn't take our eyes off of it.  The light was immensely bright and looked to be hovering very low.  A helicopter or plane was a suggestion but the lack of noise, light color, and also lack of movement were all wrong.  My nephew suggested a tower of some sort.  Seconds later the light looked as though it shifted into almost a sliver and quickly vanished to a tiny dim light and suddenly gone.  Nowhere in sight. Moments later it reappeared. This time it looked like it was descending but very slowly.  The light was so bright that there was an almost transparent beam going thru some of the few clouds that were above it, and again, seconds later it was gone.   At this point we started to travel around the hills. I was trying to look and turn to scope out the hills, but saw nothing. I looked in my review mirror and there it was.  At that very moment my brother was also looking in his mirrors and spotted it as well.   After we moved around a curve we lost sight of the light and saw nothing more.;47.0046000000002;-120.5068
