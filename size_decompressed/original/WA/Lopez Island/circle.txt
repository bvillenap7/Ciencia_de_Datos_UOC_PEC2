Moon shaped/size glowing object in straight trajectory;1975-08-01 12:00:00;4 seconds;Moon shaped/size glowing object in straight trajectory Daytime sighting during my childhood.   As I lay outside I saw an object that was the size of a full moon and about the same level of luminosity fly across the sky without sound.  It took two or three seconds to go from horizon to horizon.  It did not leave a trail.  It sounds similar to the description of Jimi Carter's UFO encounter.  Will never forget!!!
