Flashing comet shaped lights in the Western Sky;2001-08-25 00:15:00;15 min;Flashing comet shaped lights in the Western Sky We saw flashing white lights in the Western sky.  There were several that seemed to flash in sequence, but at various intervals.  They were confined to an area 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon.  The lights were shaped like comets, with the tails to the East.  At times at least two of the lights appeared more intense and green in color.  At first the lights would flash slowly and then progressively more rapidly until they went very fast, then would pause and start over again.  Near the end of the show an occasional light would streak accross the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing the laser-based advertising lights that were reported to the Victoria, B.C., police by many people there.  PD));48.5;-122.8703
