Six Objects in teh NW Sky;2019-05-22 23:45:00;4-5 minutes;Six Objects in teh NW Sky Last Wednesday I saw six objects in the NW sky.  They were sort of in a helix formation and appeared to be self illuminating.  They were stationary and made no sound. I am curious if anyone else in my area saw anything similar.;48.5;-122.8703
