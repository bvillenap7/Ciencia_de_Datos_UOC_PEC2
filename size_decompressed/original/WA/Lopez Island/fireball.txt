Four of us were playing cards in front of the window when my brother-in-law said Look, there's a shooting star.  My sister & I turned to look and it didn't look like a shooting star to us.  It was a beautiful green color and heading straight down in front of us.  We watched for just seconds, I'm sure, and it disappeared into the water.  It didn't seem like it was too far out from our location however, we heard no splash in the water.  The news is reporting it as a metior however, I thought I'd report it to you, as they are saying that it just burned up.  It was still very bright and glowing when it went into the water. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable dramatic meteor at 19:45 hrs. on this date.  We have amended the time above to the correct time of the incident.  Please see other reports.  PD));48.5;-122.8703
