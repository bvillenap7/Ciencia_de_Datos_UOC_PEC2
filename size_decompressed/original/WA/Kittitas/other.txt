Strange lights seen near Ellensburg Washington starting  to happen more often.;2010-04-01 01:45:00;20 seconds;Strange lights seen near Ellensburg Washington starting  to happen more often. On the early morning in question, I was returning home from work about 1:45 am. I had just pulled the car up infront of the house and parked it when I saw the strange light pass over head. The object was half the size of a golf ball, and was cresent in shape with the open end of the cresent virticle, and the round side pointed to the East away from me.  It was moving from North to South in the direction just right of Badger Gap, which is located on the Yakima Army Training Ground.  The object came from out of my view behind me several hundred yards to my East, but appeared to be at a very high alitude.  It was moving very fast through the sky and blinked out over the Army Training Ground. The color was the same as the full moon.  I have seen search lights, and have seen shooting stars comming through the sky, and this was not what I  saw, nor was it a human-made aircraft because the speed was greater then anything that we know of. This is the second sighting within this area that I know of.  The first happened a few months ago to a friend driving home one night from work.  He reported to me that he saw a very large, round, bright light in the early morning sky fly over his car. Seconds later, his car stalled out. In his panic he tried to restart his car but it wouldn't start. He stated that as the bright light flew off, he was able to re-start his car and drive home.;46.9818;-120.4115
