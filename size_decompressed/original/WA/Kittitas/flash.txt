Low flashing light traveling at high rate of speed.;2015-04-05 22:50:00;1 minute;Low flashing light traveling at high rate of speed. My girlfriend and I were on I-90 headed west when we both saw a low flashing light about 30-50 feet from the ground traveling at a high rate of speed flashing every second.   The object was traveling parallel to the freeway heading east.  It was about 100-150 feet away from us as it passed by.   I couldn't see a shape or any sign of a ship.  Just the flashing light and as it got close it was very dark behind the light.   When the flashing light passed us, I looked and to see how far it was going,  I was that it keep flashing at the same speed still heading east.  The speed that it was traveling  was more then 150 mph.  I really want to know what I saw tonight.;46.9818;-120.4115
