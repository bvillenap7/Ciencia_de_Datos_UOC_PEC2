Red white and blue circle among stars in Kittitas, Washington.;2019-07-25 02:01:00;25 minutes;Red white and blue circle among stars in Kittitas Washington. We were sitting outside stargazing when we saw a strange looking object among the stars. We noticed it began to flash red and blue as well as the white light.  It is stationary and has not moved, and itâ€™s too far and high to be a cell tower.  It has also grown in size throughout the duration of watching it.;46.9818;-120.4115
