Look up and see brilliant / bright orange/red object silently moving from North to south.  Perhaps a couple thousand feet in elevation.   Making no noise what so ever.  I ran inside and called my husband outside to see it.  The craft changed direction and moved westward behind a tree and was gone.  It looked similar to the brilliant orbs taped in Sumerlin Estates NV last year.  Much lower than a satellite, around the height of commercial aircraft seen in the area.   No flashing lights or indications it was any kind of terrestrial craft.  Too slow for a meteor,;47.8651;-122.2084
