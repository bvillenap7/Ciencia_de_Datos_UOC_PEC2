Flash of lights over Mill Creek;2007-05-14 23:00:00;1 minute;Flash of lights over Mill Creek I was in the backyard around 11:00pm smoking a cigarette before going to bed.  The night was clear so I was looking up at the stars.  Looking to the north of where I was standing  what I had thought to be a bright star, flashed very brightly and then disappeared.  Less then a second or two later another very bright flash took place and disappeared. this time it was to the left of where I saw the original flash.  At first I thought it may have been very bright lights from a plane, but I could not follow the lights beings it only flashed 2 times.  The flashes of light seemed much brighter than typical airplane lights.;47.8651;-122.2084
