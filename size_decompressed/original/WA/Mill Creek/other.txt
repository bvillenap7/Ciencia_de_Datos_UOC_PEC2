2 orange/red round balloon type objects with fire seen consecutively...10 minutes ? apart;2014-05-20 22:00:00;6 minutes X 2;2 orange/red round balloon type objects with fire seen consecutively...10 minutes ? apart On Friday, June 20,  My spouse and I were inside our home when I noticed what I thought was a red/orange balloon with a yellow burner coming from the west and moving to the southwest.  I grabbed my binoculars but it was difficult to focus on.  It moved steadily to the south/south east and was finally obscured behind evergreen's.    A few moments later another one appeared at the same elevation and moving the same speed and direction......I had my binoculars and tried to focus again,  it appeared that there were visible yellow flames at the bottom of the object through the binoc's but it was too difficult to tell what it really was.    We had been near SEA earlier in the evening and flights were landing to the south indicating there was a south wind.  These objects were moving steadily to the south and thus didn't appear to be balloons which should have gone northward in a south wind.  The time of 10 pm is an estimate......it could have been between 10 and 11 ! pm.  It was dark out............so readily visible in the night sky.;47.8651;-122.2084
