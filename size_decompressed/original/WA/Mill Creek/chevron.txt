A red boom-a-rang shape traveled from east to west for about 12 sec. slowly.  The front was like a red ball and the wings had a less red leading edge with a transparent wing shape.  It slowly faded away as i watched.  It could have been a meteor at high altitude with a low angle of deflection that burned up or went back out to space.  I do not know what it was for sure.;47.8651;-122.2084
