Over the last few months we have observed this objects four times. It stays in the same area, moves randomly, does not follow orbit, and a few hours later, will be in a different area of the sky.  It is usually a bright light, which changes between blue red and green, and is in a triangular shape.  The four images thing.jpg is P1010895.jpg, where the object is circled in red, thing2.jpg is P1010899.jpg, which has the object circled in red. the p101 jpg's are the original pictures i was able to take on a digital camera.;47.8651;-122.2084
Black Triangular object with red pulsating lights seen in Mill Creek, WA.;2016-02-08 18:50:00;8 minutes;Black Triangular object with red pulsating lights seen in Mill Creek, WA On way home from grocery store, saw strange lights hovering over my neighborhood, about 6:50pm, a few miles away.  Thought it far away possible helicopter.   Got home and noticed it was coming towards my house.  My son was helping me unload car, when we noticed it was actually a triangular object, pretty low and large (about size of 747), but with no noise and red pulsating lights on underside of object.  The lights pulsated inwards towards center of craft in alternating pattern about a second per light).   Sky was clear and you could also see all the stars.  We also noticed solid white light pass high in atmosphere 5 minutes after triangle was gone.   This gave me shivers and I left car door open and pulled my son inside it scared me so much.;47.8651;-122.2084
