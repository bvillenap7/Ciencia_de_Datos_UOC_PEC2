moving light in night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a twinkling star, perhaps Arcturus.  PD));2017-08-22 23:00:00;on going;moving light in night sky My wife and I go out on our West-facing deck.  She notices a light moving in the dark nighttime sky and points it out to me.  It was changing colors, red, green and headlight yellowish.   The movement of the light was about three fingers at arm's length, in all directions.   Very hard to guess distance, but i would say >5 miles.   We watched for about an hour and went in the house.  Will watch again on the following night for a possible repeat performance.;48.0379;-118.9419
