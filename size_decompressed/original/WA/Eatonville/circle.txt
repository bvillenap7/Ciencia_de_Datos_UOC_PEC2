PD));2019-05-26 22:32:00;4-5 minutes;silver, round balls of light flying together very fast and low on the horizon.  There was no sound. It was May 26th, 2019, at 10:32 pm in Eatonville, Washington.  I was out watching meteors, when I noticed 3 small round lights in the sky, low on the horizon.  I thought for a minute it was Orionâ€™s belt. But then I saw it was in the wrong place.  About that time they started to move very fast and together.  I was looking into the east.  They flew around changing spaces between them and changed the how high they were in the sky.  They flew around to the North and then were gone.  They were round and glowed. It all happened in about 4 to 5 min. and of course, my phone and camera was in the house.
