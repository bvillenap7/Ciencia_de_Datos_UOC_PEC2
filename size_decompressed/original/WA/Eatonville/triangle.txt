Observed this two times now aprox. 10:20 PM both times in area of Hwy 7.  First time at the top of Muck Creek hill myself traveling North, craft hovering aprox.500ft  completely still and NO noise.   Second time Northbound same area , craft coming towards me figured it was plane as lights came on.  But as I proceeded craft stayed in my windshield frame and realized it was descending right over me.  Again NO nois , sped up and crested the hill, it descended till out of sight towards the road.  Kept watching in rearview and truck passed and saw brake lights.  Looked online and it looked like TR-3B.;46.87;-122.2723
