We saw some very unusual flashes of light and in one case, a object leaving the area of the Flash.  The first one was inside the Big Dipper - it looked like a bright explosion!!  The second flash occured in the SW night sky, it was very high above the Earth's atmosphere and flashed 4 times. The third flash was in the SE sky and consisted of 5 flashes. A object (like a satellite) was observed leaving the area of these flashes.  We also observed many objects moving in irregular patterns, changing directions & dis-appearing. Anyone else in our area see anything?;47.5888;-122.8789
