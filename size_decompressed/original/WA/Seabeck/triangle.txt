Last night, I couldn’t sleep so I was looking for shooting stars.  This was about 3:00 am.   Along came a very low flying object  that looked like a plane.  It fascinated me though because all three points on the “plane” were so bright!   There was one point on the object that continued to blink every few seconds.  I continued to watch it fly.   Since it was so clear last night I watched if for miles and miles.  I could still see the blink probably 40-50 miles away.;47.5888;-122.8789
