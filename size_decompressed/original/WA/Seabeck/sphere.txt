They were in a single file line, with about a 10 foot space between each and they were approximately 40 to 50 ft. above our car. They had no markings, made no sounds, no lights, nothing protruding from them, no visable propulsion system or anything... just huge floating metal balls. When the sun hit them at one point, they shone with the reflection of the sun. This was witnessed for 10 minutes then we drove off out of fear.;47.5888;-122.8789
