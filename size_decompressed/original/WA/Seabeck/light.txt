colored lights rotate around in a orb, way brighter then a star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));2007-09-15 11:30:00;10-15 minutes;colored lights rotate around in a orb, way brighter then a star me and a friend were outside admiring the clearness of the night and looking at stars when we notices what appeared to be a much brighter star. it was slowly moving side to side or up and down and would sometimes completely stop. we got a telescope and when it was focused it appeared to be a circle of rotating light of several colors, red, green, yellow, and blue. the lights would go continuesly in a counterclockwise motion. about 5 to 10 minutes later a smaller dot dropped below it, i didnt see any lights on this one. it began moving  back and forth in the sky before shortly disapearing. we wondered if it could just be a plane or rescuse helicopter, but a plane or helicopter would have ran out of gas long before this object disapearred, not to mention the lights didnt look like that of any helicopter, plain, or satellite, i finally went inside and checked up on the object every now and then. each time it would be farther to one direction in the sky.

Video of bright light in sky near bangor sub base.;2011-06-02 22:00:00;1 minute;Video of bright light in sky near bangor sub base. I noticed a bright light moving in the sky obstructed by trees and had my cell phone in hand so I took video of the object. (approximately 40 seconds of video)  The object was changing color from white to amber and had almost a jellyfish shape to it.   The object moved sporadically then disappeared.  It was NE to my location in line with Bangor Nuclear submarine base.  An aircraft flew through the same path in the sky approximately 30 minutes later.;47.5888;-122.8789
