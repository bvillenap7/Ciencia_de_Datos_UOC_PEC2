Bright disk shaped light, it made no sound. The edges were sharp and clear.;1974-09-29 04:00:00;4:00;It was pitch dark when I pulled into the fishing spot next to the Kalama River in Washington State.  I had showed up to early for fishing, so I sat in the car drinking coffee waiting for daylight.   A light coming throughout the trees caught my attention toward the road.  It was a bright disk shaped light, it made no sound.  The edges were sharp and clear. It was moving slowly down the road about 60 feet above the road and stopped.  Then a car came and when the car was directly under the light the dish shape followed the car at the same speed but drop down as it moved at about 45 degree angle.  Then it would stop and moved back to its original position.   When the next car came it did the same thing.  It moved quickly and in sharp moves and did not hover.  After the last move it stop and started moving toward me slowly.  The size was twice  bigger then a car  at this point I had my window down and I almost started the car and leave but as it got closer it stopped.   At that point it moved up and away at 60 degree movement and stop again. It moved in quick small circular movements and stop and moved higher again then would stop and do quick small circular movements at this time it was becoming smaller like a small dot in the sky.   Till this day no one believes me.;46.0112;-122.8166
