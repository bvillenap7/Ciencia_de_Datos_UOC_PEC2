Two disc shaped objects moving from South to North along the I5 corridor in Cowlitz County.;2008-02-19 18:40:00;4 minutes;Two disc shaped objects moving from South to North along the I5 corridor in Cowlitz County. I was in our front yard with our dog.  I just happened to look up and saw two disc shaped items in the air moving from south to north along the I5 corridor.  When I realized it wasnâ€™t a plane or balloons, I called my husband and daughter outside and they witnessed this with me.  The two discs were a dark grey and stacked upon each other.  They separated where you can see sky between them.  Then they appeared to move like a clam shell opening and flew for a few seconds end on end and then leveled out as if following each other as they went out of sight. This object did not have any sound, no lights, it stayed the same color and shape and they kept a straight path with no erratic movements. There was not enough time to run into the house and get the camera, but I did render a drawing of what we saw.;46.0112;-122.8166
