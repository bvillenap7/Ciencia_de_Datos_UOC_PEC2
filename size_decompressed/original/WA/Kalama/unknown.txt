Objects seen on clear night sky 30 miles north of Portland, Oregon.;2010-09-05 01:45:00;10 secs;Objects seen on clear night sky 30 miles north of Portland, Oregon. It was a crystal clear evening with the stars shining brightly.  I saw a bright white light at approximate 15,000 ft agl about 5 miles to the north moving to the east.  No sound accompanied the light.  I watched it for about 10 seconds and then it just disappeared.  I went over to the east side of the house and could not find it. Again no sound.  This appreared strange to me as I sit outdside almost every night and watch the sky when it is clear and look for shooting stars.  This was not a shooting star and it was not an aircraft because it did not possess the green and red lights that usually accompany an aircraft. Another evening about 2 weeks prior at about 4am, I noticed a fast moving object moving about three times the speed of a commercial aircraft moving from south to north at about 39,000 ft.  Twice it emitted a white blast of smoke or exhaust from the rear. I am an uneployed Meteorlogist/Flight Operations Specialist is is well versed with all types of commerical and corporate aircraft having flight planned them and built their routes both in the United States and abroad.  This aircraft emitted no sound either and did not possess the green and red lights that accompany a commerial or private aircraft.;46.0112;-122.8166
