This object was too far away to see shape.. it just looked like the brightest star out there.. it was a clear nite and at first I thought it was a meteor.. but then it began to  make a large circle and zig zag then blink out and stop dead in the sky then blink back on and continue this large circle ove the tri cities.   .I first saw it in the east and it curved over to the north around to the west and south then back toward the east again before it blinked out the last time it had made a complete circle and I thought it was going to go around again. I went inside to tell friends what was happening but when we tried to find it again were unsucessful. this is actually the first time I've seen anything like this and am intrigued as to what it might be.. I'm hoping someone else may have seen it and could help me to understand what it was.There was no decernable sound and the whole thing lasted 10 min or less. there were no ru;46.2515000000002;-119.1034

Flying flashing lights every night. What are those things cause there's is alot of them.;2013-07-20 00:00:00;3 hours;Flying flashing lights every night.  What are those things cause there's is alot of them. First off I dont believe in UFO'S E.t but these past 2 or more weeks been seeing alot if red, green, orange and white flashing lights.  At first I thought they were stars untiln I seen them move around.  I know they were not planes for the fact I live by an airport and can hear planes really loud as they fly by.   I took vid of 1 and as I was filming one started to fly above me so I quickly turned towards it and kinda got freaked out cause it was close and quiet that on vid you can just hear cars passing.   Can someone tell me what the heck those things are.   I also have vids I took on different occasions but none got this close before.

Straight line of lights about 1/4 mile apart each.   ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-05 04:45:00;25 minutes;Straight line of lights about 1/4 mile apart each. I saw approximately 35 lights traveling in a straight line about a quarter mile apart each going from west to east. I couldn't tell how high up they were when I noticed them.  There were two closer together flying as well as three together later in the line of lights.  They weren't going especially fast nor could I hear anything.  I first noticed them when I stepped out for morning air at about 4:45 am and I watched them for about 25 min when there were no more.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
