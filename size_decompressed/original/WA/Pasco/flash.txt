It was traveling fast enough to cover a quarter of the sky in about 6 seconds. It was the fastest satelite I have ever seen, so it caught my interest and I immediately thought it may have been a missle.  It's path was nearly directly overhead about 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon to the west.  About 1 min after I lost visual contact with the object to the north, there was a bright star that appeared in the sky about 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon and about 5 degrees north from direct east. It appeared in the constelation south east of Cassiopea.  This Bright Star was 2-3 time brighter than anything in the sky, about the intesity of aircraft landing lights. It was so briliant that I immediately thought that a new supernova had just been seen, but the brightness faded and the star dissapeared after about 1 min.  Because of the coincedence of the events I surrmise that they were connected. My gut feeling is that the bright Flash may have been in response to the very quick satelite Moving from the south to the north.  A Star Wars defence mechanism or simmilar devise. It was the strangest thing I have seen in the sky for a long time, hopefully someone else can verify the existance of this bright flash object.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
Large green light seen descending over Pasco, WA.;2016-09-06 00:15:00;4-5 seconds;Large green light seen descending over Pasco, WA. On September 6th, 2016 at 00:15 I was driving home on the I-86 from Pasco, WA towards Prosser, WA. I was traveling about 60 mph and I noticed an exceptionally large green light with a white haze around it appear in the sky. If I held my arm out fully extended and compared my fingers to the size of this light in the sky, it would be about 3 or 4 fingers in size. It did not seem to be one solid shape but rather a reflection of part of a shape.  The floating green light sped downwards in the sky as soon as it appeared. It took four to five full seconds for it to disappear and it appeared to have descended into the city. It had no tail whatsoever. It did not appear anymore, and I was alone in my car at the moment of the sighting.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
