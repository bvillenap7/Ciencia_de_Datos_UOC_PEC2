Winged-shaped transparent , no sounds orange yellow glow.;2014-05-22 03:00:00;10 seconds;Winged-shaped transparent , no sounds orange yellow glow I was out side cooling off on a hot night and something above me caught my eye I glanced up at it thinking it was a shooting star but then I focused on it and realized it had a a odd wing like shape and was somewhat transparent looking.   It was surrounded by a faint orange yellow glow.   It glided across the sky with no sound and left a trail of light behind it.  Once it got to a certain point it vanished.
