The description of the UFO made me sit up straight out of bed and for a brief moment I relived my only UFO encounter. It was 1974 or 1975, can't remember for sure without doing some research, I was working on a dredging project  on the Snake River, just below Ice Harbor Dam, a few miles northeast of Richland, Washington, five miles from the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers. A large, disc shaped object, black on the bottom and silver grayish on the top, moved slowly across the Snake River, north to south, directly across my field of vision. I was sitting in an operator's cab about forty feet above the river and watched the object float silently across my field of vision. No noise, no lights, no erratic motion. Sixty to eighty feet long, fifteen feet high, moving at 10 mph, I got on my Motorola Radio and asked all vessels in the area did they see what I just saw, of course everyone that answered made fun of me. It wasn't a plane, it wasn't a blimp, it wasn't a helicopter. The Hanford Nuclear tank farms are about twenty miles south, huge electro transmission towers run down the east side of the river from Ice Harbor Dam. When I heard the UFO's description on the radio last night a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders, it was the same object I'd seen two and a half decades ago. Thank you very much, I'm not as crazy as I thought I was.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
