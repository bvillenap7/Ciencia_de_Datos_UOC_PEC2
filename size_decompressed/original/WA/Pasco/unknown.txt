Accelerating light;2011-10-30 05:22:00;3 seconds;Accelerating light On October 30, 2011 at 5:22 a.m., I witnessed an orange ball moving due west in a straight line over Pasco, WA.  It was approximately 3000 feet in the air.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed, much faster than an airplane, with no sound.  It appeared to accelerate and disappear leaving an orange trail retracting (yes, retracting) in the sky just as fast as it had accelerated.  There was no sound or visible shape.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
Large dark mass hovering near Pasco, WA airport.;2012-02-20 17:10:00;10 minutes;Large dark mass hovering near Pasco, WA airport. Object seen approximately 1 mile SW of the Pasco airport, altitude approximately 2000'. Size that could be seen would be equivalent to several jet aircraft.  No lights were seen. There was complete cloud cover and the object was hovering just in the cloud layer.  As the clouds moved past the object, different portions could be seen (photos attached).  What does not show on the photos since they were taken with cell phone, other dark masses of the same object or others, could be seen as the clouds moved.  It appears that most of the object was within the cloud layer. ((NUFORC Note:  We have known the witness who submitted this report for 55 years.  He has considerable technical training, he is naturally skeptical, and we suspect that he is an excellent and objective witness.  PD));46.2515000000002;-119.1034
UFO Near Lightning Storm;2012-07-11 23:00:00;3 minutes;UFO Near Lightning Storm It was a warm night out near Pasco, in the desert, and 5 friends and I were out stargazing. In the distance were thunderstorms, which were flashing every 5-10 seconds.  As we were sitting there near the car (which we had turned off the headlights to), what appeared to be a craft came out of nowhere, about a half mile to a mile away.   The object continued on a course straight to our right, and made slight movements up and down until at a point, it ceased to move.  The object then turned, shining towards us two D-shaped lights, one D as is typed and the other turned on axis.   Then the object turned 270 degrees counterclockwise and commenced towards Pasco.  We were silent and heard no rotors.  There were lights which blinked on the craft, similar to a helicopter, yet no sound was made.   My friend speculated it to be an Apache helicopter, yet this seemed unlikely because of its movements.   I later discovered that the area we were situated in was close to the area where! materials for and the atom bomb was created and tested.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
Three flying objects;2012-07-31 21:00:00;20 minutes;Three flying objects During this event I was located on 22nd N Ave in Pasco, WA.  I was looking north in between 9- 9:30 pm. I got off my car because it was a full moon Tuesday night.   The main object was in the very back and had two smaller objects in the front all gliding in a single file order.  All three crafts were precise when turning to trail one another.   The one in the back had three white lights on all used in high beams.  The two smaller crafts were trying to lead the bigger craft that was in the back as if it werenâ€™t trying to get spotted by the airport light tower.  The middle craft had two lights on both white colored and were low beamed.   The craft in the front had two lights on, one red one white while both were flickering.  Both lights were in low beams for the front craft.  There was no noise present.  They must have been 30-40 ft. apart from each other. They came in from the north maybe Spokane, WA and left going towards Yakima, Wa.  Photos were taken using a 2.0 mega pixel camera. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, to reflect an evening sighting.  The report was initially posted on August 05th, 2012, with the incorrect time.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
Bright white satellite looking object North Eastern sky rapid speeds vertical and horizontal object turns blue as it changes directions;2017-06-23 03:50:00;10 minutes;Bright white satellite looking object North Eastern sky rapid speeds vertical and horizontal object turns blue as it changes directions Out of the two videos I shot, you can see this satellite looking object zig zag through the sky turning a bright blue color over and over.  I was not able to tell the shape of the object by sight or in my god awful video I took of it.  I saw a bright white star looking object, looked like a satellite in the sky but much brighter.  This object appears, moves horizontally at about the speed of a small aircraft, then went vertical at a rapid speed.  This object then continued to move horizontally back and forth occasionally moving higher in the sky and seeming to turn a blue color as it changed it's direction instantly.  I tried to drive in the direction I saw it after I lost sight of it, but I couldn't find an answer to what it was.  I talked to a couple different police officers on duty near the airport, I called air traffic control and I am waiting for a call back. Today was my second sighting of this object flying through the early morning sky, same location and about the same time.  The first time I saw this object was 06/19/17 in the North Eastern sky while observing Venus between 3am and 4am PST.  I tried to wake my wife up that night to show her, and of course it was gone by the time she came out.  I went out and bought a Nikon p900 to get some close up shots of the moon, Jupiter and Saturn this week.  Early this morning I went around the same time as I did on the 19th in search of this object, and there it was.  I ran inside grabbed my camera that I don't have a clue how to operate and shot this footage.  I did a terrible job shooting the footage, but hopefully it's enough to show what I was looking at.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
