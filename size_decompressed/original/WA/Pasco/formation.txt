Woke up to check on dog which was barking constantly went into backyard where I saw a man in the alley walking away calmly it looke liked he had just jumped the my back fence when i came outside. I heard a strange buzz as soon as i walked outside and looked up and saw many diffrent colored balls oflight in a circular pattern just staying in place above what seemed to be my whole block within seconds the all the lights dimmed to where i could no longer see them. I checked the alley as soon as i renembred there was no one but a car alarm did go off down the street don't know if there is any connection between the guy and what i saw in the sky.I did not call the police as it seems that there was no attempt of robbery.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
