Riding in a car, I thought I saw a white helicopter coming our way-told the driver-she said it was a drone-I thought a plane-then we both watched it change form to real narrow-as a bright white light appeared as it took form of a space ship-the bright light changed to a narrow form and as it turned away heading away and to the right it disappeared.  It seemed to have changed three times different shapes.  It didn't go into any clouds-they were the other direction.  By the time I decided to take a picture it was long gone. This was during the day time. Sun still out. Never saw any thing like it before.  The night before a friend came over saying he just saw a UFO in the dark night hours.  So odd that I saw one that next day.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
