Gunmetal grey type aircraft with two bright lights and a red blinking light in the center over Pasco, WA.;2008-09-02 23:30:00;several minutes, I drove ;Gunmetal grey type aircraft with two bright lights and a red blinking light in the center over Pasco, WA. I was driving up Rd. 68 in Pasco, WA past Douglas Fruit Plant.  I believe it was somewhere between Douglas Fruit and Selph Landing.  I live out in the country in West Pasco and was heading home at 11:30 p.m. after visiting a friend's home. I looked to the left of my drivers side window and saw some sort of aircraft.  My mind was trying to rationalize what I was seeing into being a plane but it was very low, possibly only 100 feet up in the air and I could see a vague outline of it.  It wasn't black, more of a gunmetal grey color. There were two very bright white lights in the front I'm not sure if it was the front or not.  What I thought was weird was that there was a bright red blinking light in the center of the two white lights.   I rolled down my window as I drove slowly by and there was no noise. It was very close to the road but was over the cropland. It hovered moving very slowly.  My car was moving much faster. I started to veer off the road from looking at it and then straightened my car and continued on.  It was still there it seemed as I drove away.  I've tried to find similar things to what I saw on the internet and haven't seen any helicopters or planes like this.  I did see a Youtube clip of  triangle shaped lights someone taped in the air at night.  It also had a red blinking light.  But this perspective was from below and I could see more of the side of the aircraft.   Another car drove by not long after me and I wondered if he might have seen it too.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
5 orange lights in a perfectly still triangle shoots of in different directions like a comet.;2014-10-05 19:30:00;5 minutes;5 orange lights in a perfectly still triangle shoots of in different directions like a comet. I have lived in pasco wa my whole life.   I was leaving my parents' house and I looked to the left in the night sky towards king city WA.  I see a triangle shape in 5 Orange lights perfectly still.   I keep looking then I look more around those lights and I see the stars which are the same color and size as they always been.  I tell my gf what is that she looks and is surprised.  I tell her those aren't stars because they are bigger.   As I tell her this the top light shoots off to the left like a comet.  The light below the top light on the left shoots off to the right.   After being perfectly still it shoots off in opposite direction.  As im driving im seeing this.   So after 3 minutes I pull over where I can take a picture.  Then the 3rd light (bottom left of triangle) shoots off to the left.  I took a picture of the last 2 lights (middle right, bottom right of triangle) we have never seen anything likes this.I told my brother about it.  He works at a warehouse in the direction of where I saw the 5 Orange lights (orbs) he told me he also sees strange lights ot the two.;46.2515000000002;-119.1034
