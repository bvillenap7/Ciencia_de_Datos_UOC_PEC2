I had gone out to watch Betelgeuse whose scintillations are lovely at this time of year when it is close to the horizon.  My attention was drawn to a point of light, red in color and steady in brightness.  It appeared in the area between Betelgeuse and Castor and Pollux.  After a few moments, it was joined, one after another, by two identical points, the three forming a perfect triangle, two of which were separated by about the same distance as Castor and Pollux are from each other.  The base of the triangle was on the top with the third light underneath, closer to the horizon.   As I watched, the three became larger, but their configuration did not vary, still a triangle but a little more orange in color and much brighter, resembling an amber-colored street lamp, i.e., a sodium vapor light.  I dismissed the sighting initially, thinking they must have been artificial in nature however, their appearance was arresting, as they seemed to be moving toward me, growing! ever brighter in intensity.   I was transfixed, having some considerable familiarity with nature sky object, yet these were out of place, and I had no explanation for them.   I went out the following morning and confirmed that the area in which I saw the objects was open sky.;48.0304;-122.7683
