Tight ly grouped string of lights/object?;2021-05-16 01:50:00;One minute, approx.;Tight ly grouped string of lights/object? I let my dog out at 1:50a or so, maybe 1:45a. Clear skies, bright stars visible. I looked up to the east and saw a string of bright white lights slowly passing by. The length of this was about as long as my index finger, extended to arms length.  I had binoculars and my cell phone just inside the door, so I looked at the lights through the binoculars. Crystal clear lights, straight line, very close together.  They were as bright as the stars and made no sound. A few in the line were not turned on, making a break in the line, but there were about 35 all together.  As I was trying to turn on my cell phone camera, the lights had moved out of view, hidden by the fir trees in my backyard.  I saw on a youtube channel that a few other people within 50 miles of me saw this too. One man described it as The Empire State Building laying on it's side. He felt it was a solid object from his angle, and he used binoculars, too. I think of it as a string of lights.;48.0304;-122.7683
