Flashing object seen shooting northwest high over the Olympic Peninsula!  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible tumbling rocket booster??  PD));2005-05-26 22:58:00;5-8 seconds;Flashing object seen shooting northwest high over the Olympic Peninsula! I saw this object shooting across the sky over the Olympic Peninsula in a Northwestern direction. For a few seconds it was very dim, and for a few seconds it would be a bright flash, and back and forth until it was out of sight.  It was traveling very fast, and high. The flash looked almost like flame or an explosion. The flash also was round in shape, not trail like in shape as if it were out of the atmosphere, away from the effects of  the atmosphere. And no sound at all. Anyway, I was wondering if there were any other reports from that time and area? ((NUFORC Note:  Depending on the direction the object was moving, we believe that the witness might have been looking at a booster rocket, tumbling in orbit, would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.
