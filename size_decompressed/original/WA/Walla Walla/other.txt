I was out walking my dog at about 9:30pm it was just about fully dark out with a half moon to light up the sky.  I just happened to look up into the sky in time to see a dark object in the sky flying faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.  It had no lights and made no sound.  It was out of my viewing range in a matter of 5 seconds.  It was flying really low between 1500 and 1800 feet.  But it was too dark to see anything physical about it or any shape.  There is no military base near here and just the shear speed of it just really makes me wonder what I had just seen.
