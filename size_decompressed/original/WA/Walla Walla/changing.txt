My;2010-07-25 18:00:00;Aprox 10 sec;The sighting happened towards the latter part of July 2010.  While watching my son play I noticed  a large object in the distance.  My first thought was a hot air balloon since we have many in the area during the summer months.  It only took a second to realize that it was no hot air balloon.  Having worked in the aerospace field in the past I am a pretty good judge of flight characteristics of all aircraft both military and civilian.  The trees in the photograph though they look close are approximately 300 yards from the children in the foreground.  I am approximately 10 yards from the children.  The object is behind the group of trees.  The photo was taken with a Blackberry curve cell phone.  The direction is due east looking at the foothills of the Blue Mountains, Walla Walla Washington.  The time was approximately 6:15 pm.  The Sun is at my back.  This object had structure.  The color was dark with different shades of gray.  It seemed to be of a metallic! type substance but did not shine in the sunlight.  It had no visible lights.  After taking the first picture the object slowly rotated to a profile that measured approximately 20% of its circumference.  At this point the object either moved directly away from my line of sight or imploded out of sight, either way it happened faster than the blink of an eye.  I did not have enough time to take any more pictures or a video of the object.  The entire incident took approximately 10 seconds.
