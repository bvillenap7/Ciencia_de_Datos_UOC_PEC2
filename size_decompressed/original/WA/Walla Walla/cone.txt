Picture of cone shape object in evening light.;2007-06-03 20:00:00;?;Picture of cone shape object in evening light. This is not a report of a sighting but a possible picture of a UFO?  I was traveling home from Walla Walla, WA. To the Tri-Cites area on the evening of 6/3/07 approximately 8PM.  I was watching the sunset as my wife and I drove home.  It was getting dark and the sunset was very nice.  I had brought my camera along because there were a grove of trees that wanted to capture in the evening light.  I slowed the car, rolled the window down and took 3 pictures 10 to 12 seconds apart.  At this point I thought nothing of it and continued home.  It was too dark to capture the trees so I put the camera away.  This evening 6/4/07, I was looking at he pictures and noticed something on the last picture.  I think one of your experts could look and maybe have an opinion.  Iâ€™ve reviewed all the pictures thinking there may be something on the lens but nothing shows up.
