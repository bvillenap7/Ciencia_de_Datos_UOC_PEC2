Every jet flying moves accross the sky, we felt that this was on purpose During a air show in walla walla I was using pair of 7x35 binos to observe the air show.  I was watching the jets do there thing when I noticed overhead, a silver object that appeared to be cigar shape bright silver color. I used my eyes to get a idea about how high it was, I guess around 7 to 10 thousand feet. I watched the object for a few minutes and showed it to the people who were sitting next to us along with my wife. We did not notice at anytime that the object had fixed wings to make it appear to be a plane and we were very positve about the shape.  It appeard also to be blunt on the ends not pointed like a high flying plane.  The object stayed in one spot for about five minutes and then dissapeard.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
