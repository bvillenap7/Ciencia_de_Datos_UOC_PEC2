Three UFOs spotted over Walla Walla WA. on new years day by five witnesses.;2012-01-01 19:30:00;15 min;Three UFOs spotted over Walla Walla WA. on new years day by five witnesses. New Years day 2012, Walla Walla WA. At approximately 7:30 pm I was on my way home driving east making a right hand turn south and noticed a bright red light in the sky my girlfriend, 7 YO god daughter who were also in the front seat of the car saw the red light too (approx. 40 to 45 degrees from horizon looking south) my 49 YO friend and my girlfriends 9 YO niece who were in the back seat also saw the light. I told my girlfriend the light was a planet either Venus or Mars most likely mars because the light was red. She agreed it was a planet because the light was not blinking and the light was larger then all the stars. Anyways, I was excited because I had binoculars in my car and wanted to take a closure look at what I thought was a planet. So I pulled into the driveway got out of the car with my binoculars and the object was gone? We were all baffled, but my girlfriend said “no look its right there”, when I saw the light we realized it was at a different p! osition in the sky, approx. 30 degrees from horizon, I focused on the object through the binoculars and noticed it wasn’t a star or planet. The object was a red sphere split horizontally with a single very bright white light moving right to left (at the split) the object was stationary for maybe ten seconds then the object began to move almost vertical (5 degrees right to left) from 30 degrees to 45 degrees (this took about four  seconds), at the 45 degree position from horizon the object stopped and appeared to move away from us in the direction we were looking at it until the object completely vanished (approx. 8 sec. at the 45 degree position). Anyways we all went inside the house talking about what we had just saw, less than a minute later I decide to go back outside and take another look, and there in the same area just above the tree line, the same object appeared, my girlfriend, god daughter and I looked at the object through the binoculars and the object went throug! h the same maneuver as described above. I have gone back outsi! de to se arch for the object with no luck. I did call local police to report what I saw, and the said to call Pasco WA airport tower and make a report because the Walla Walla airport tower was not opened. Anyway, I am guessing that the object was approximately 15 to 20 miles away from the point where I saw it. The size of the object from where we saw it was about the size of a dime at 25 feet away. Well I just wanted to tell others what we all saw and attempt to describe the sighting to the best of my ability.  Regards,;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
Two orange orbs seen in daylight.;2013-07-03 21:15:00;25 seconds;two orange orbs seen in daylight i was sitting on my front porch when i noticed an orange orb above the tree tops. it flew right over my house, never changing altitude, speed or direction.  it flew basically west to east and took 12 seconds to pass over.  when the first one had disappeared a second one flew over.  same speed, altitude, and direction.   they were very low, just above the treetops and appeared to be only about 2-2 1/2 feet in diameter.  they were opaque, no flames and were orange with some kind of changing red color also.  there was no sound coming from them at all.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
