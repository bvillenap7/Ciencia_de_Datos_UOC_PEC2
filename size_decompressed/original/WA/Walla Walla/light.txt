A bright greenish white light hovered about 2000 feet high, then began moving & flew rapidly w/o sound over the Blue Mtns of NE Oregon;1975-08-07 21:30:00;Approx. 3 Minutes;A bright greenish white light hovered about 2000 feet high, then began moving & flew rapidly w/o sound over the Blue Mtns of NE Oregon [I was walking into my back yard (in Southeastern Washington) where I lived at that time enjoying the mid-summer night air and ambiance that the season brings.  I glanced up at the night sky since it was a very clear night following a very warm day that August in the mid-1970s.  I saw this bright full green circular light that at first, appeared to be a star.  However, it seemed really very close as if it was only a few thousand feet high.  I estimate it was between 1500 and 3000 feet high. I knew it was not a star, but couldn’t figure out what it was.  Momentarily, I began feeling kind of strange, almost as if I was being watched, however, I have no proof of this and realized it could have been my imagination.   There was no sound, except for the flowing creeks in the back yard.  The object was completely silent. Then, suddenly, it began to move very slowly toward the southeast.  It barely moved at first, and then it gradually increased in speed until it exponentially flew across the sky and over the Blue Mountains over NE Oregon, much faster than an airplane ever could.  There was never any sound.  It seemed to only take 3-4 seconds for it to fly past the horizon following its decision to move.   Then it was gone.   I have never seen anything like it before nor have I seen anything like it since then.]    (Note to Reviewer Only:  I thought the incident was recorded in my Significant Dates Log, but it is unfortunately, it is not listed.  It was either 8/7/1975 or 1973.  I’m going to check my journals in storage in Southern Oregon during late July 2011 to see if I recorded it there.  I learned of this by reviewing the Peter Jennings video report from the mid-90s and decided to take action on this).;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
Bright stationary light seen in NW sky.;2002-03-17 01:55:00;20-25 mins;Bright stationary light seen in NW sky. At approximately 0155 noticed a bright light located approx 30 degrees up from the horizon in the northwestern sector of the sky. Sky was cloudy and it was snowing off and on. The light remained in a fixed position for approximately 10-15 mins and then slowly began to drift in a northly direction. The brightness of the light remained the same throughout the sighting until it just vanished. It must be noted that the drift was at a extreme slow pace. I was a law enforcement officer for 14 years and for the past 10 years have been a boiler plant operator and work shifts, which has afforded me the opportunity to observe the night sky at all different times of the night. In my company at the time of the sighting was a federal law enforcement officer and both of us agree that it was to cloudy to be a star. It must be noted that Walla Walla is a small community and although there are occasions for airplane traffic in this area, there were no scheduled flights for this time of night.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
Bright aqua light seen hovering then moving at high speed not more than 100 feet above ground level.;2008-05-09 22:00:00;1.5 minutes;Bright aqua light seen hovering then moving at high speed not more than 100 feet above ground level. Extremely bright aqua-colored light appeared to hover over wheat fields 2.5 miles north of HWY12 and just west of Middle Waitsburg Rd in area where there are no buildings or roads. Thought possibly a helicopter, although no noise was heard. After about 1 minute the light disappeared then reappeared almost instantly about 1 mile over to the west by southwest. After hovering there for a moment, it moved south and out of view at extreme rate of speed, probably too fast for a helicopter although not too fast for fixed-wing aircraft.

Bright Green Light over Walla Walla, WA;2012-09-07 01:00:00;5 seconds;Bright Green Light over Walla Walla, WA I saw a strange solid bright green light on September 7th 2012 it was early Friday morning around 1 AM. I had just finished some school work (I’m a college student) and decided to sit down and relax for a bit before I went to bed. I was sitting in-front of my big picture window in my living room that faces the setting sun when I saw this incredibly bright solid green light that was round in shape and about 100 feet off the ground go flying above the tree line about two blocks down from my house. What was really strange is it made no noise and was moving at an incredible speed it was moving so fast that it actually streaked across the sky. The size from my perspective looked like it was about the size of car. The speed that it moved at was faster than any plane or helicopter that we have around here. It’s a rural community and although we have an airport there isn’t that much traffic and the light was moving horizontally, and if it was a plane it would have ! been moving vertically (over my house) because the airport is on the other side of town behind my house. So it wasn’t a plane. I went outside to see if I could see the path that it followed but it was gone, it’s trajectory was an upward angle so it would be odd if was a meteor. I honestly cannot say for a fact what I saw but it was the strangest thing I’ve ever seen living around here.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361

Bright light hovering over Walla Walla.;2017-07-08 02:35:00;1 hour;Bright light hovering over Walla Walla Driving home from North Bend and witnessed a non-moving light in the sky just outside of Pasco, WA.  The light was circular in shape and appeared to be staying still possibly spinning.  I attempted to video it with my iPhone and when I got it to videotape apple symbol appeared as if I had restarted my phone and stayed that way till I neared Walla Walla.   Past second street on highway 12 i got my camera to work again and I started filming the object which was over the airport not moving, just a really bright light. I shot video for 1 minute and exited on Wilbur and headed home.  The light then started to follow me.  Once home I noticed the light down my street and i pulled in my drive way and ran around the side of the house to see if it had come all the way and it was gone.   I went inside and got a flashlight and let my dog out and went into the back yard to see where the light was and it was gone. I saw what looked like the light but now a great distance away and appeared to be a weird shaped star.   Went to check the video today and it is gone.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
