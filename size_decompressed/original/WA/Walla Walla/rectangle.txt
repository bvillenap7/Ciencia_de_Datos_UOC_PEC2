The object began to get closer and closer and we realized it was not a meteor.  As the object came right over our home there was nooooo sound and it had four corners with lights underneath the craft.  It was moving very quickly!!  What I didn't understand is when it was flying over is it wasn't bright as it was when it was in the distance!!!;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
