Huge chevron shaped craft flies silently over park in middle of town!;2014-03-12 23:15:00;15 seconds;Huge chevron shaped craft flies silently over park in middle of town! I left my house on my motorcycle at right about 23:00 heading to my girlfriends house.  About halfway there, as I was driving along the south side of Pioneer Park on Whitman St., I looked up and saw a chevron shaped craft flying about fifty feet above the tops of the tallest trees in the park. The craft appeared to be about a football field in length with three visible lights on the bottom.  One light was on the underside of the leading tip of the craft and the other lights were on the underside tail of each wing forming a triangle pattern.  The ship was dark grey in color and although it was well after nightfall I was close enough to observe the entire vessel. I put the engine in neutral and hit the kill switch for the motor with my thumb.  I figured a craft that size must make noise but I was even more surprised when it wasn't making a sound. It was cruising from the Southwest corner to the Northeast at an impossibly slow speed of maybe 20 or 30 mph. A few seconds later I could no longer see the ship because the trees were blocking my line of site, so I dropped my bike into gear and popped the clutch,since I was still in motion, and hurried to my girlfriends house.  The entire sighting only lasted around 15 seconds. I searched the internet and local newspaper for any other mention or reported sightings but found none.  Months later I came across a video documenting the Lights Over Phoenix sighting from 1997.  A number of witnesses describe a very similar type of craft.  I would have made this report much sooner but I just came across this website this evening.   Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.
