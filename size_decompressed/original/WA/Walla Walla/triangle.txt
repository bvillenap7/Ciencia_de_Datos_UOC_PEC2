6+ships;1992-11-13 19:00:00;1-2 hours;6+ships That night we were listening to the police scanner when there was a report of strange lights.I called my sister whom lived by and headed out the door with 2 other people.I turned around to get my camcorder when the 2 young females came screaming and running through the door in total fear.They said they saw it to the west and it just shot straight up and it was huge.After calming them down several other friends and I went out and there were 2 crafts at first but then it was like they gave birth and 2 smaller crafts came from each the other larger crafts.They were going sideways and sitting hovering,disapearing and reapearing it was eeary I felt as if they knew what we were thinking and they knew we were watching them.My camcorder kept shutting off over and over and over.At some point one of the men in the group said OH my god look up and we saw a large round craft as big as a shopping mall all covered in small red lights hovering maybe 30 miles above our house.My daughter didnt sleep in her room for the next 6 years after wittnessing the incident.I thought if I ever seen one I was be amazed but we have never been so frightened in our lives.I dont care if people believe I KNOW,...;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
Large triangle over Walla Walla;2015-03-12 20:10:00;2 minutes;Large triangle over Walla Walla. As I was locking the back door to my work I noticed a bright white light with a pulsing red light just below it in the sky to the west. I pulled out my phone to record the lights because I knew they looked strange.  As it floated right over top of me I realize it's a triangle.   White light in front and 3 white lights behind in triangular formation with a red pulsing light in center.  I could see it clear as day.   West to east and no sound that I could tell. I got about 2 minutes video.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
Triangle craft Solid  white front light 2 solid lights in the rear 1 solid red light in the middle  extremely low.;2015-03-12 20:20:00;20 seconds;Traingle craft Solid  white front light 2 solid lights in the rear 1 solid red light in the middle  extremely low. I was coming home from getting pizza from dominos.  I was just about ten feet from entering my house, when I noticed how clear the sky and how bright the stars were.   I looked up briefly to look at the stars, and then I saw plain as day a craft of some  sort  flying in a straight line with 1 white light in the front 2 white lights in the back, forming a triangle and a red light in the middle.  I was literally looking almost straight  underneath this craft.  The strange thing was for how low it was  it was extremely quiet.  Not silent, but extremely quiet.   I ran the 10 feet to my sliding glass door and told my girlfriend to come outside right now.  I turned back around walked 3 to 5 steps as she approached  and pointed up to the object and said, Look at that do you see that?   She said, OH WOW.  What is that?   I am extremely  skeptical  of  say spacecraft.  But the words that came out of my mouth were, that cannot be a plane, can it?  She responded no way what is that. We have a very small airport nearby.  The airport is so small that a lot of the people that have lived in this town for some time know what time  flights  leave.  I am not saying all flights, some.  The reason I point this out is that I am accustom to seeing  plans that have recently taken off or are about to land at  this airport.  This  did not resemble any of those.   The light in the front was solid the 2 lights in the back were solid and the red light in the center was also solid they never blinked or turned off for the duration that I saw this craft.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
Slow moving triangle shaped craft with three red blinking lights in center.;2016-11-08 00:05:00;10 minutes;Slow moving triangle shaped craft with three red blinking lights in center I live in rural Walla Walla, Wa.  At about 12:05 AM on 11/08/2016 I was in my kitchen working on the computer.  I heard a very loud rumble flying over my house so I went outside to investigate.  A large triangular craft was flying over my property with three red flashing lights underneath in the center.  The lights were arranged in a triangle pattern and blinked on and off together at a pace of about one beat per second.  The edges of the craft were rounded and the points of the triangle were also rounded.  The underside of the craft was contoured and rolled underneath along each side and tapered out to the triangle points in a series of parallel rolls on each end. The blinking red lights appeared to be deeper set in a recess in the center of the craft.  The craft color appeared to be metallic silver.  The craft was lighted around the edges because I could see it so distinctly. The craft flew very slowly from the northwest and flew to the southeast toward the Blue Mountains.  It flew a distance of about 2 miles and was approaching the Blue Mountains when the craft appeared to be stopped in mid air for a short time and then flew on at such a slow speed it was difficult to see movement at a distance.  The blinking lights finally disappeared over the mountains.  The craft was so large that it was still very visible in the distance. The whole event took about 10  minutes.  Unfortunately my camera was in the house and I did not want to leave to go get it.  It was very dark out and no moon.  The two neighbor dogs barked while the craft was overhead.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
