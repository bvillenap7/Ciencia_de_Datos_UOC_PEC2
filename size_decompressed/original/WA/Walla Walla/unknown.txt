Low flying Orange glow object;2007-08-20 00:30:00;6 Seconds;Low flying Orange glow object This was about 3 years ago i was out walking my dog on a walking path near Fort Walla Walla at about 12:30am.  All the sudden this fairly large object flying about 1000 feet ahead of me and about 700 or 800 feet off the ground came into my view from behind some trees.  It was surrounded by a light orange glow and it made no sound.  I was watching it fly for about 5 or 6 seconds and then all of a sudden, I could hear like the sound of a electrical short circuit and a buzzing sound and then I saw white sparks fly and then the craft was just gone. no trace of it.  It was the strangest thing I have ever seen.   I was looking in the paper the next day for any report of downed aircraft but never heard anything about it.

UFO over Walla Walla WA.;2009-09-13 04:00:00;1 hour and 20 min;UFO over Walla Walla WA. On Sunday 09/13/2009 at about 04:00, I went out side for a smoke and looked up towards the south eastern sky and noticed a slow moving, flashing light.  I went and got my wife up to come out and see the craft which was flashing red, blue and white lights.  We could tell it was very high and far off.  This object was flying straight up, down, left and right, and in circles unlike any other known aircraft to me. I went in and got my binoculars, which have photo and video.  I took 30 to 40 pictures and several minutes of video of this object.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
