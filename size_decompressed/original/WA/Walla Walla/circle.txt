Make no sounds except when dropping stuff Was standing outside when I saw 3 objects in triangular formation.  I could not tell the altitude, but would guess it to be no more than 10,000 AGL.  Thought they might be planes or helicopters but there was no noise and no blinking.  They moved with such percision.  They moved in formation for a while and then took off to the West one by one at an unbelievable speed.  I could not tell what the shapes of the objects were but they put off enough light so we could see them.  We thought they had left and then suddenly they reappered in the same general location 10 minutes later.  This time only 2 were seen.  Both of the objects were  stationary while one of them suddenly flew away from the other at an incredible speed and then suddenly stopped all in the matter of seconds.  Then the object that distanced itself from the other flew very slowly to the north and then began dropping stuff.  It made a slight popping noise, almost looking like and sounding like a firecracker.  The stuff that it dropped seemed to disappear with in seconds after it released it. After this it hoverred for about 30 seconds then suddenly took off back to the West.  I lost sight of the stationary object also.   Have never seen anything like it, and it gave us all the chills.  Didn't believe in such a thing till now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects date to Sunday morning, April 30, 2006, at 00:15 hrs.  PD));46.0593999999995;-118.3361
Strange orange-red objects flying over Walla Walla, WA.;2007-06-12 23:30:00;6 min;Strange orange-red objects flying over Walla Walla, WA. In the SW part of the sky at 23:30 there were 30 round shaped objects that were bright orange-red in color and in a pattern similar to the large dipper.  As I realized they were not stars they started to gather in a linear formation.  I ran into the house and woke up a second witness to watch what was occuring.  The second witness went and got a video recorder to film the event taking place.  The objects then started to disappear backwards into the darkness of the night sky.  The objects colors didn't flicker or change color. The whole sighting lasted approx 6 minutes until 23:36. There was no sound that humans could but the area animals were reacting , no trailers from behind the objects.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
Red-orange orbs slow and low-flying over town.;2013-08-12 00:00:00;30 seconds;Red-orange orbs slow and low-flying over town My two friends and I were standing outside on Landen St (close to Wal-Mart and Myra road) and one of us looked up and noticed a strange orange-red ball of light moving across the sky.  It seemed to move in a wide arc above and behind the trees in the distance. It looked fairly close to the ground, maybe tree-height, and not too far away from where we were standing, either.  I estimate the balls to be roughly a couple feet wide.   The first ball traveled a bit and then started to fade, and as it did so, another one showed up where the first one had started (none of us saw it appear, we just noticed it out of the corner of our eyes while observing the first one), and followed the first orb's pathway and died out just the same.  They were silent and almost pulsating/fluctuating tones of color/rippling in shape.  We attempted to take video but we could not autofocus because it was too dark and the orbs disappeared when we tried to manual focus, but we do have a bit of blurry footage of one of the orbs.;46.0593999999995;-118.3361
