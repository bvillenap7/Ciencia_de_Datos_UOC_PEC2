I set my phone to video and slow motion.  I was on the back patio.  All the lights and the TV were off in the house.  I pointed my phone up in the sky and did a 26 second slow motion recording.  When I reviewed it, there appears to be a strange craft that I did not see when filming.  It is somewhat diamond shaped and has flashing white, blue and amber lights.  The fact that I did not see it makes no sense to me because it was pitch black out.  People think it may be a drone but it does not look like a drone to me.  Very strange. Thanks;48.0795;-117.6269
