She went out with the intention of barking at something but found nothing to bark at.   I looked up in the northeast sky and saw what looked like a helicopter moving slowly, headed north.  It had blinking lights of different colors: red, green, blue & white.  It stopped and held motionless.  I pulled out my telescope and sighted it in.  The blinking was irregular, and the colors were intense.  It appeared oval or round in shape and the lights seemed to form around its shape.   It moved slowly in different directions, but mostly stood still.  It was 6-7 miles away, and probably 3-4 miles off the ground.   I watched for about 1/2 hour until it became obscured by clouds.  It was located at about the midway point of Loon Lake, just over the northeast side of Highway 395.  It was not above the lake, but was about 1-2 miles off to the northeast side.;48.0795;-117.6269
