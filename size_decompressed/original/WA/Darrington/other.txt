Three  Super Load Sonic Booms;2000-12-05 15:27:00;seconds;Three  Super Load Sonic Booms On a great day hike in the Pacific North West!....... On are way back from the Boulder River Forest,((name deleted)) his Son ((name deleted)),and Me were coming down the trail which is covered by huge Trees and forest growth even in the winter times,We heard three Sonic booms that had shock sound waves that shook the ground really hard and US The sound was very loud and seemed low to the ground,We all looked up but could not see anything we faintly heard what we thought were planes?....But did not see anything!...Or hear any thing after like jets in the distance I thought this was very strange,I asked them what they heard or saw and we all heard the same thing but did not see anything I checked the Time on my watch I remember as we were heading up the trail we had seen huge Rock slides from what looked like recent Huge Boulders that slid down over the trail and toward the river!..... This is a very Hilly Area lot's of small Mountains as well and It's in a National Forest I dont think there is any low flying black projects jets are aloud to demonstrate any testing in this area I believe!... But not sure???? Anyways for what it's worth here it is Thanks Peter Have a Great Christmas and Look forward to talking with you in the Future as Well A Happy New Year (((Godspeed)));48.2387;-121.5888
