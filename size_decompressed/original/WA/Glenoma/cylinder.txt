At first we couldnt tell if it was light reflecting on a power line or logging operations because sometimes they start very early in the summer.  We pulled over off the side of hwy12 and got out of the vehicle not long after we got out the lights started moving across the the sky toward the east.another driver pulled over just in front of us and got out and started watching the object. I have no real logical explanation for what we saw it looked to be very high in the sky and massive. You could really tell the shape just a long string of close lights that were perfectly straight and moved steadily across the sky in a straight direction toward the east.we watched it until it went back behind! the hillside it was visible for a couple minutes.i tried to take videos of it but it didnt turn out my buddy got a video of it that isnt the best quality but you can see the lights. I've never seen anything like this before I dont know what it was except it was not a natural occurrence.;46.5283;-122.099
