Then it started to weave back and forth and move between stars.   There were no blinking lights on it, and it never moved in a straight line.  It just weaved around stars.  It made a circle around from north to south and then it weaved around three stars, it blinked and disappeared.  As it weaved around the last three stars, they blinked, as it passed.   I don't believe in aliens or UFO's, well, until now, but this definitely freaked me out. It was way too high, I think to be a drone.  Not sure what it was, but nothing like I had ever seen before.;46.2773;-119.4951
