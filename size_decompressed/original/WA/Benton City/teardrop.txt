bright blueish white fireball crossed the sky southward;2004-12-13 06:35:00;2-3 seconds?;bright blueish white fireball crossed the sky southward hi, not sure who to report this to or who to talk to to see if anyone else saw the same meteor. on 12/13/04 monday morning this week at about 635am as I was arriving at work and looking almost due south from benton city,wa. I saw a bright blueish white fireball that was traveling southward thru the sky. it seemed to travel low enough to pass under the scattered clouds in the early morning sky. I watched it briefly before it just vanished long before it would have passed from vision. (it was like it burned up)I hope that you can help me with this or refer me to someone who can. thank you ((name deleted));46.2773;-119.4951
