Bright orange and white lights low in the sky and then just disappeared.;2010-02-05 19:15:00;3-5 min;Bright orange and white lights low in the sky and then just disappeared. At about 7:15 pm on February 5, 2010, my step-son and his girlfriend were outside.  They called to the house to have my wife come out and look at these lights in the sky.  She went out on the back deck and then called me out.   When I looked to the south, there were 3 bright orange lights in a triangle formation low in the sky.  They moved off to the southwest and the lights got dimmer and then just disappeared. At the same time, several more of the bright orange lights came from the SE, low on the horizon.  They moved very slowly, but not in a straight line.  It was more of a jagged line.  It was not normal.  There was a commercial aircraft flying due south at the time that was definitely higher altitude than these lights.   The lights slowly moved from east to west then headed south and disappeared.  My wife got some pictures of them on her phone.  One group of 3 and one group of 2. It was very eerie.  There is absolutely no way these were any type of normal aircraft.  They were low in the sky, close to us and were completely silent.  The first thing I thought about was our proximity to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.  It kind of freaked me out a little.;46.2773;-119.4951
