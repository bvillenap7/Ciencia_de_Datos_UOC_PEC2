Green, gaseous streak or cylinder.;2013-11-20 05:45:00;1-2 seconds;Green, gaseous streak or cylinder. Location: Latitude 46.231674, longitude -119.665865 on westbound I-82. Elevation above horizon: &#877666 ° above horizon dropping to &#8776 30° over 1 second . Azimuth: 225° (SW} Angled at &#8776 75 – 80° from horizontal horizon Perspective size: 1/4” width at arms reach, 5” long at arms reach. Weather:  Mostly clear with light, very scattered, thin cirrus clouds.  Dark, very little twilight in eastern horizon. Description:  No autos following me or oncoming.  I was travelling west of Benton City, WA, east of Prosser, WA, on Interstate 82 westbound.   Pale, perhaps translucent and gaseous, fluorescent green streak or cylinder originated from above towards ground, with lower end squared off, with rounded corners, as though ended with gaseous cloud at its termination.   No actual object seen or right spot to indicate an object entering the atmosphere, appeared to be a vapor trail.  It was not bright as in a meteor event and lacking the “sparks” commonly seen departing from main meteor in its travels.  Never seen anything like this in my 53 years.;46.2773;-119.4951
