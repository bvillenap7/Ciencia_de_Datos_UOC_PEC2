very strange sighting;1995-06-01 22:30:00;2 minutes;very strange sighting I was coming home from a family function,in a t top convertable with a friend and I saw a light off to my left as I was heading east on a road nw 4 miles nw of benton city-I thought at first it was the nieghbors barn light but I relise it wasn't because we then passed by the barn--then I thought it was a hanford patrol helicopter with a spotlight on the front as it was moving along side my car-so i thought I'd show off to my friend. I sped up very rapidly to follow the light and it suddenly got extremely small and made a teardrop looping motion and came directly at us,it was so rapid that it was frightening and moved with unbeliveable quickness directly at my vehicle,I quickly turned around and came back down the road to my driveway and pulled in.We got out of the car frightend as a huge steel object silently and slowly moved over my house and shop directly above us it was so large that I could not see either side and it covered the entire view directly above-we quickly ran into the house and I got a rifle and just sat on the couch waiting to see what would happen next,finnally after about 30 minutes I went back outside and it was gone.I know this sounds rediculious but it really happened-------very Frightening----- ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
