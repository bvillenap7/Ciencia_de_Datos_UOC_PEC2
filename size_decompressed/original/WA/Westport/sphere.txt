WHILE ON VACATION IN WESTPORT WASHINGTON, MY SISTER AND I WERE WALKING ALONG THE BEACH AT NIGHT. THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND THE STARS WERE OUT. WE HAD NOTICED WHAT APPERED TO BE A SATELITE IN THE SKY. AS WE OBSERVED IT, IT HAD MAD SEVERE TURNS BACK AND FORTH FROM ONE END OF THE SKY TO THE OTHER. IT WAS MOVEING SO FAST IN EVERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION. EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE IT WOULD STOP IN MID FLIGHT, THAN CONTINUE WHAT IT HAD BEEN DOING. IT DID THIS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE IT COMPLETELY DISSAPERED.;46.8828;-124.1003
