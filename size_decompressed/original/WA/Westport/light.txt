Turned to level flight then it traveled at level flight to a point in the sky and stopped.  It then proceeded back along it's orginal flight path until we couldn't see it any more. We were on vacation just outside of Westport Washington  My son and I were sitting out late looking at the stars and any Shooting stars we could see.  I was looking up at the the Milky Way and all of a sudden I saw what I thought was a really big shooting star.  But it turned, Just as I said, what the hell!  My son said what is that?  It entered the atmosphere at a steep angle,  it was brighter then any of the stars in the sky and about the same color,  it then turned to the east in level flight were it appeared to cool down in brightness, to what looked like a sattelite.  We watched it travel halfway accross the sky and stop.  It sat still for about 10 seconds then started moving west back along its original flight path. We warched this thing for about 2 minutes in total.;46.8828;-124.1003
