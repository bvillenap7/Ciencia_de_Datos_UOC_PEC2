Fireballs flying across sky then burned out.;2019-07-04 22:00:00;5 minutes;Fireballs flying across sky then burned out. My fiance and myself went to the westport marina to watch the fireworks at approximately 10 pm on july 4th 2019 when we noticed a ball on fire floating across the sky, but spinning it would burn out after a few minutes but stay solid black flying like it had a purpose towards the ocean towards ocean shores then after it was almost out of view we noticed two more following the first one doing exactly the same thing making absolutely no noise. It wasn't fireworks I'm sure.  An older army vet next to us witnessed this too he said he never saw anything like that in his life he said it didn't look military or like a drone.;46.8828;-124.1003
