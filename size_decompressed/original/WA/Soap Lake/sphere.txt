re:  6/9/17 Boulder, CO, report!;2007-06-30 20:00:00;10 minutes;re: 6/9/17 Boulder, CO report! Summer 2007, I think it was, I had several sightings involving brilliant white orbs of light. One, the first, was so similar to the 6/9/17 Boulder, CO, report, that I have been moved to recount it here. In my original report, I described two types of orbs, one brilliant white that appeared as a metallic disc upon arcing miles away in a second or two, then pausing before disappearing straight away.  Another orb, deep reddish orange, smooth-surfaced, glowing darkly, appeared at the end of the event.  I now am thinking it may well have been the same craft!   After the initial sighting, with the object having arced away from a standstill corresponding to my fearful reaction, and while I was feeling bad for having only seen it so briefly, I think it came back, only this time it was moving slowly beneath the clouds erratically shining a beam up into the clouds along with a red pulsing light, still overwhelmingly brilliant white orb of light otherwise.  It disappeared into the clouds. Some moments later the reddish orange dark glowing orb appeared just hovering up in a pocket under cloudy outcropping  directly above me until the clouds enveloped it. Wish I knew what they were. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.3826;-119.482
