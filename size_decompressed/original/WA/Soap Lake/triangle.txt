Several white, noiseless, triangular objects, no lights,  sighted in North Central Washington State;2001-04-15 10:30:00;1 to 1-1/2 min;Several white, noiseless, triangular objects, no lights,  sighted in North Central Washington State I was watering roses and noticed something to my left moving above garage.  Looked up and saw 6 to 7 triangular white objects (no lights, no noise) moving south over property.  Objects appeared to be 6-12 ft wide and maybe 6 ft long.  It took about a minute for them to travel about 800 ft and out of sight behind a coulee (hill) on the property.  I was too scared to run into house and get a camera.  Property is isolated, on the lake, about 3 miles north of soap lake.  I was a Quality Manager at an electronics company in Moses Lake and did a saturday night oldies show on FM radio in Grand Coulee.  Several weeks later, a friend of mine (a court reporter) were outside the courthouse having a cigarette and I asked him if he had ever seen a UFO.  He said about a week ago, he couldn't sleep, went to his back porch for a cigarette about 2 am and saw several white, triangular objects in the sky.

The craft was a large triangle.;2004-08-20 10:15:00;5 Minutes;The craft was a large triangle. Highly credible individuals. I did not believe in UFO's until this event.  The object was a large triangle. We could not see the craft, only the lights. There was a bright white light on each corner of the craft. It had to be one unit as the lights stayed in the same formation as it moved from South to North, then, North to South across the night sky. I lost sight of it after about 5 minutes as it appeared to move to far into space to see.  It came back into sight again momentarily and then was gone.;47.3826;-119.482
