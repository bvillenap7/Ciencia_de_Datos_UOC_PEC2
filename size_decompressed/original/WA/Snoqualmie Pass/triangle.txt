Before noon on Sunday the 13 of april, my Aunt and I were traveling west on I-90 with Lake Ketchless on our left.   Out of the top of my driver's side window, I saw a craft come into view  and procede past and into full windshield view.  We both exclaimed, What the heck is that! at the same time.  Then another came into view behind the first and they proceded into the first valley on the right after the snowshed.  They were low enough to be seen clearly, flew very fast and were drone size.  I told her i thought they must be drones, but i'd never seen one.  We were baffled by the experience all the way to Canada...and still.   I have searched the web for pictures of drones and have NOT found a picture that IS what we saw.  It clearly had a nose out front but no wings sticking out the sides.  Sort of trianglular, but not.;47.4422;-121.4349
