Daylight.Hovering.15;1999-08-21 20:20:00;10 seconds;Viewed solid object, rectangular or diamond shape, 300-400 ft above ground from apprx. 1000 ft away while driving. Daylight.Hovering.15-20 feet long. At about 8:20 PM while driving westbound from Snoqualmie Pass on I-90 I looked out my driver's side window and noticed an object above and to the side of my vehicle. I estimate that it was about 300-400 feet above the terrain and I was no more than 1000 feet away. What I saw was a solid object which seemed to be a rectangular box-like configuration or maybe a diamond shape, I can't be to sure of the detail as I only was able to view it for about 10 seconds. It did not seem to be moving but I could not be sure, as I was going at highway speed in its direction. I would estimate its size to be 15-20 feet long and was a dark color with no lights although it was not black as some highlights were visible. It was not a simple rectangle but seemed to have some features on it. I watched it for a few seconds before I realized that it was not an aircraft and then I looked for overhanging power lines or cables or some means of suspension but there were none. At that point it became obvious to me that this was not anything like I had ever seen and it began to dawn on me that I was witnessing something quite out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, within 10 seconds I could not see it anymore as I had passed it by. I strained to see it in my rear view mirror but I could not see it again. I did not pull over because of heavy traffic. It took a few seconds to process what I saw because it was so hard to believe what I was seeing. It seemed so ordinary yet an object (a box, no less) just doesn't hover in mid air, but there it was. I tried to tell my wife what I was seeing but she could not see it from her side of the car. This was a daylight sighting, although the sun was already below the horizon there was still plenty of light. I am very familiar with aircraft and have never made a sighting like this before. I know what I saw but I don't know what I was looking at. I am at a loss to explain what this was. I don't have the slightest idea what I saw. I have never heard of UFO's in this configuration before. This is not a joke.;47.4422;-121.4349
