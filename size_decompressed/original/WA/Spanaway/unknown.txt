The Radio Station was being flooded with calls.  They said Deltas were sent to investigate the objects and the jets were appeared to be played with, by the 4 objects.  The radio station reported that KING 5 News was sending their News Reporters to the scene.  We have watched the local Seattle News today - nothing has been mentioned.

My neighbor was visiting, so I did not experience this alone. I am sitting inside, on my my recliner chair that faces north, my neighbor is sitting on the couch that faces east. We are simply in discussion of whatever subject and there's a flash of darkenss, such as when the power went out. The time was 'approximately' 6:30 pm, and it was full sunlight outside, there were NO lights (electricity) on within the house (nor was it needed). This flash of darkness happened within a flash - estimate of time at a layman's guess was only about a second (somewhat to 1-2 blinks of an eye). At that time, my neighbor and I both spoke alarm with this inicident. It was as though the sunshine simply blinked out! Facts: (1) I live within 12 miles east of McChord AFB - granted there is military aircaft that flys over/around on occasion, BUT there was NO forwarning of any sound, which is always typical! This flash of darkness happpened WITHOUT warning (no sound effect(s). (2) I was sitting in my recliner facing north to a wall with the fireplace with peripheal vision on my left to the outdoors (sliding glass door) and my neighbor was facing east towards a halfway wall with a skylight on the cathredal ceiling. I have a huge living room window to her backside covered by a window shade. At any rate, I was requested to state this in hopes to relate to anyone else that may have experienced the same 'incident', hopefully to those living in my area. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be unusually eloquent and credible.  She described the events in very objective, factual, and matter-of-fact fashion, and we suspect she is reporting quite accurately.  We have requested that the neighbor submit a report, as well.  We are baffled by this report, particularly because of the other reports from the west coast of Oregon, at approximately the same time.  PD));47.0773;-122.3921
