shooting star like object that gets really close and moves up and down then shoots off without a noise!;2011-06-25 23:00:00;5-10 seconds;shooting star like object that gets really close and moves up and down then shoots off without a noise! I was sitting on my back porch last night and something caught my eye which looked like a shooting star at first.  It started off dim and then got brighter but unlike a shooting star which fades fast it kept getting brighter and closer as close as a plane in the nights sky and then slowed down.  It had a reddish amber glow which emenated an aura around it.   It moved irradically up and down and diagonal then before I could call my wife out to see it, it shot across the horizon as fast as a shooting star and then disappeared without a noise.   I have never seen a plane move like that before and the direction and speed of travel was out of this world.   I was shocked so I sat outside to perhaps see it again and I did see a star which started to move like a sattelite but was much brighter.  It was super bright and moved very slow across the night sky from the point of the big dipper East towards the mountains.  This was different than what I had seen earlier but still pretty cool.   It seemed to get brighter and brighter filling the night sky and then dimmed fast and out of sight.  Not that It was past the horizon to where I couldnt see it any longer because when it had dimmed it was right above me.  Very strange.   I guess I need to focus on the stars more often because you can see crazy stuff.  I notice that more and more u.f.o sightings are happening more regularly I wonder if 2012 end of the world hooplah has something to do with more and more u.f.o sightings.  I guess I won't know until 2013.;47.0773;-122.3921
Two circular white lights observed moving across sky, side by side at roughly a 45 degree angle.;2014-04-10 22:45:00;30 seconds;Two circular white lights observed moving across sky, side by side at roughly a 45 degree angle. Two circular white lights were observed moving across the sky at a steady pace.   The lights traveled side by side, but were (roughly) at a 45 degree angle from each other.   I was able to watch them for roughly 30 seconds before they disappeared.   This event occurred roughly around 10:45 pm (22:45) Pacific time.;47.0773;-122.3921
Saw something weird in the sky..;2014-08-28 00:00:00;10-20 seconds;Saw something weird in the sky.. It appeared out of nowhere.  Four bright white lights.  I saw it from my bathroom window.  It looked like the lights of a huge jet that is getting ready to land except it was no where near the base to where it would land and it was too high up to land.  I called for my roommate and he froze when he saw it.  Then as if it knew we saw it and were watching it started to dim it's lights out as if to hide.  You could still see a dark shape... Big! Moving up just a little...  It was floating in place.it didn't move the whole time we were watching it except to dim its lights out.  It was a clear night sky only some clouds but it showed up right I between those clouds.  Midnight.;47.0773;-122.3921
Yellowish light moving at extremely hight rate of speed.;2014-09-14 20:15:00;15 seconds;Yellowish light moving at extremely hight rate of speed My son-in-law and I along with his two very young children were on the back deck of my home looking at stars before the children went to bed.  Suddenly, to the west, a circular light appeared, moved in a northerly direction for about 15 seconds, and disappeared.  The light moved at a phenomenal rate of speed, much faster than any jet, even military, which I have ever seen.  In all fairness, I will admit that there is an Air Force base to the west of us, but the light did not move all the way across the sky, just suddenly appearing and disappearing.  It did not fall from the sky light like a meteorite.  There was no sound associated with the event.  My son-in-law also saw the light and commented on the incredible rate of speed of the vessel.;47.0773;-122.3921
