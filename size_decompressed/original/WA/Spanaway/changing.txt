One evening Myself, my brother and my grandmother stepped out onto our back porch and noticed some odd black shapes in the sky about two or three miles behind our back yard above a tree line.  Using binoculars we were able to get a better view, I noticed they were all black, yet the outer rims seemed to wave all around the circular shape of the object.  IT was odd and it’s a bit hard to describe what it actually looked like, though if you look at the tail fin on a fish, and how it waves through the water, from top to bottom, that might help to get an idea of how it looked.  That’s the only thing I was able to imagine that looked like it.  Once we saw the few that had appeared first a few more just appeared out of no where, then they slowly started moving up into the sky towards the few clouds that were there and also left and right, then down a bit, then stopped in mid air and floated and a few more came, then moved up into the clouds and we didn’t see any others after that.  Not one of us can explain what they were, they were not planes, they were not balloons, they were not birds, we could see them with the binoculars and how they moved, it was...odd and unexplainable , for us at least.

Speedy balls of fire;2012-07-04 04:00:00;1 minute;speedy balls of fire This is the third time that I saw it in my CCTV monitor.  It always happens in the early morning, around 03:00 and to 4:00 am.   I have a 4 channel CCTV system that monitors my property at all sides.  One of the cameras became infused in white cloudy light and there was a round object hovering on top, really quite low because the camera is installed in the second floor level.   Then it left looking like a ball of fire because of the speed, and there were two of them, then disappeared from the screen monitor.;47.0773;-122.3921

We were driving on Mountain Hwy road and noticed what looked like a very bright multi- colored star, but seemed too close to be a star.  We decided to film it and noticed what looked like, a disk shaped ufo. Doing a frame by frame of the video, I was able to get ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.0773;-122.3921
Couldn't sleep so I went out to smoke looked up facing S and noticed a bright light that wasn't familiar.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius? PD));2017-11-27 01:30:00;30 minutes;I could not sleep so I went out to smoke looked up facing south and noticed a bright light that wasn't familiar.  I've lived there 17 years I know my sky.   So I went inside grabbed my binoculars saw it was odd then went back inside for my camera and new batteries. two pictures batteries die, replaced them took two more pictures and they die too.   After a half hour and 3 sets of batteries I got twelve pictures.  Very strange colors so bright and changing shape and subtle movements.  I have lived near my local military bases forever no plane or craft looked like this.  I watched it til it disappears around 2a.m. .;47.0773;-122.3921
A large bright stationary &quotstar&quot spit out several star looking objects which would then disperse in different directions.;2020-08-22 22:00:00;20 minutes;A large bright stationary &quotstar&quot spit out several star looking objects which would then disperse in different directions. A large bright stationary star spit out several star looking objects which would then disperse in different directions. The objects then moved across the sky in different directions while visibly dodging other objects in the sky. Some of these formed triangles following a single craft. The large bright stationary star then spit out 1 large RED CRAFT. These objects were high enough in the sky to have the appearance of stars. The red craft shot across the sky diagonally which crossed directly above me and my sister. The res craft was bright enough that we figured we could pick it up on camera. I started recording and my sister asked jokingly asked the ufo if the aliens were here to let us know they are here. Immediately the craft stopped propelling directly above us when she asked almost as if it knew we were staring at it. The craft then flashed BRIGHT lights down at us and descended towards us rapidly while continuing to flash at us. Each flash had a heatwave that came with it and our faces felt sunburned while our heads felt like we just had ct-scans. The craft then hovered above us at an estimated 500 feet above us. It went from clearly above 30,000ft to 500ft above us in a matter of seconds. As it flashed at us I felt magnetized to stare and almost stuck where I was. It started to get closer and my sister ran inside shouting RUN but I felt like I couldnt move. To be honest I don't know how long I stayed outside staring up at the bottom of this craft. When we went outside about 10 minutes later the craft was gone but you could smell melted tar from our roof. We then watched multiple crafts roam the sky the entire night. I do feel that if I had stayed outside longer when the red craft came down that I would have been taken. I am actually not sure if I lost time or actually was taken because the next thing I knew it was nearly midnight.;47.0773;-122.3921
