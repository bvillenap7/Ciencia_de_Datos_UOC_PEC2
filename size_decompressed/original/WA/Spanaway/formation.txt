We were observing from the East looking west.  A craft from the west was travelling north bound. The craft was travelling rapidly and changed direction at a swift and steady pace and then travelled heading to the east.  This craft hovered oddly in the horizon, and brightly lit amber colored 5 orbs, in order arose from the horizon one at a time and eventually formed in a formation that my daughter could only described as a Nike swoosh. The bottom one disappeared first and in order from bottom to top disappeared (appeared to head north) with the final top one lasting approximately 30 seconds longer before it disappeared too;47.0773;-122.3921
