Huge Bright Red Glowing  Sphere/Ball Falling out of the sky in Spanaway/Fredrickson area;2017-11-22 23:41:00;1 minute;Huge Bright Red Glowing  Sphere/Ball Falling out of the sky in Spanaway/Fredrickson area I was heading down 224th in Spanaway going from West to East at 11:41pm tonight, while talking on the phone to my husband.  Out of nowhere, a bit to the left, there was a huge red ball falling at a high rate of speed.  It looked like a huge red falling star, or a beyond huge flare.  It wasn't blinking, or changing color, just huge and bright red sphere/ball falling from the sky heading East.   It wasn't a plane, or helicopter, as there is a little airport close to where it was, but it was going beyond that and looked like it was going to land in the Classic Golf Course in Spanaway area, or a bit North of the golf course.   I have never seen anything like it.  It lit the sky like noting else I have ever seen.  The car in front of me slowed way down and I was yelling at my husband to hurry up and go outside to look at it.  Tried to find my phone, but couldn't in time.;47.0773;-122.3921
