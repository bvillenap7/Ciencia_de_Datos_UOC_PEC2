Several sightings over Spanaway, WA, of fireball objects with intentional direction of travel.;2011-07-04 20:30:00;3:00;Several sightings over Spanaway, WA of fireball objects with intentional direction of travel. First sighting was an odd almost flare looking item in the western sky heading east while there was still a bit of day light in the NW.  The item had what appeared to be a canopy or wing hanging over the fire ball and did not lose altitude while turning to the southern skys and cruised at a methodical speed until finally disapearing altogether.  Several more appeared from the east and took the same path with at one time, four were visible heading in the same direction before dissapearing a few seconds within one another.  Over the course of the night a few more appeared, however not as close in location and were off in the distance.;47.0773;-122.3921
Ball of fire in the sky twice in one night.;2012-07-04 21:45:00;2-3 minutes;Ball of fire in the sky twice in one night. We were getting ready to shoot off some small fireworks for the kids when my husband noticed a strange light in the sky.  Myself and my neighbor got up to look and it looked like an orange fireball.  There were no flashing lights as if it were a plane,  You could not see any shape to it to make us think it was a plane.  There is an air strip very close to our house so we see planes regularly.  It was just a ball of light high in the sky.  It went from East to West and then we lost sight of it.   Later that night about 10:30pm we saw it again from our back porch.  It was moving slower this time and almost hovering.  We went into get the camera but as we were trying to find a setting to take a decent picture in the dark it disappeared.;47.0773;-122.3921
23:00 (Pacific Time), two glowing spheres (like fire balls) were seen floating in the night sky.;2013-07-04 23:00:00;5 minutes;23:00 (pacific time), two glowing spheres (like fire balls) were seen floating in the night sky. On the evening of July 4th, 2013, I spotted two anomalies in the sky.  It was around 23:00 (pacific time), and I had just returned home from watching a fireworks display.   I got out of the car, opened up the back to retrieve some blankets, and for some reason or another felt compelled to look up at the sky. I first saw a single red/orange sphere (or fire ball is the best I can describe it)high up in the sky, slowly gliding from my left to the right.   The sphere first went at a relatively slow pace (hovering in place for a few seconds at a time then slowly gliding again).   Then, after about a minute, it suddenly became immensely bright (to the point that it almost hurt my eyes) and seemed to become bigger.   The sphere then flew from right to left to right again, and then zipped at an impressive speed across the night sky.   As the object was zipping across the sky, I suddenly noticed that there was a second (identical) red/orange sphere beside of it (though it seemed to be at a slightly lower altitude beneath the other light).  Shortly after I saw the second sphere, they both zipped across the sky and out of my view. I am not sure if the second sphere had been there during the entirety of my encounter with the spheres, as I was so taken with the first one that I spotted.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it.  So, I cannot say for sure if the second sphere appeared only when the first zipped across the sky, or if it had been hovering in that place the whole time. I would love to know what these objects were.;47.0773;-122.3921
Washington State 4th of July UFOS.;2014-07-04 22:20:00;3;Washington State 4th of July UFOS Just witnessed 7-8 bright orange craft to the west of my home.  Undeniably UFOS.  I have never seen anything like them in my life except for Youtube videos.  I wish someone else was here so I wouldn't feel crazy.;47.0773;-122.3921
