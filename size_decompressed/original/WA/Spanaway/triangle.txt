v shaped object near mcchord afb;2011-06-25 23:34:00;10 seconds;v shaped object near mcchord afb on this particular evening at the end of june at 11:34p.m. i looked north in the night sky. this would put pacific avenue to my right and mcchord afb to my left. looking up i saw a v shaped object with six red lights moving slowly almost directly above me. upon initial examination i could immediately tell that the space in the middle of the craft was empty because i could see stars in this space. the space between the lights was black. it moved silently from west to east. the craft wasn't big, just a little larger than a fight plane. it's elevation was no more 1,000 ft. i was born and raised in tacoma, having seen many military aircraft in the skies. none of the objects i have seen in my life have looked like this nor have any aircraft i have seen operated silently.

Low hovering craft;2020-08-14 23:30:00;45 seconds;Low hovering craft Me and a friend were headed to Arby’s on mountain Highway in Spanaway, WA as we are driving down 176th and approaching B st at the intersection there it’s a traffic light as well as we looked to the right we both screamed “Oh my god” we both saw what looked possibly like a mini stealth bomber or drone barely moving almost hovering  about 100 to 159 feet off the ground.  It was black really thin and had two or three lights on the bottom.  It was about about  500 to 800 feet across I think I’m not good with guessing that type of stuff, but we were freaking out we looked at each other in disbelieve then when we looked back it just had disappeared in the trees.  It was insane. I believe it was a military aircraft but what was it doing out there?;47.0773;-122.3921
