Continuous Fireworks in the sky near Arlington, WA;2003-07-29 23:00:00;5 Minutes;Continuous Fireworks in the sky near Arlington, WA All I can say is that when we first noticed it, it looked like fireworks. But what made us curious was that when you see fireworks, they go up explode, and then eventually burn out. Whatever this was went up, down, back up again, then back down again, with no discernable pattern, and changing colors and brilliance the whole time. We were on our way back to Bellingham, WA from Seattle after watching The Seattle Mariners. I am pretty confident about the date but the time could be off by an hour(later).  We were traveling on Interstate 5 and were just north of Marysville when we first noticed it. We watched in amazement for about 5 minutes before it went behind some trees, as we were traveling about 65 m.p.h. When we got to where we thought it would be visible again, we saw nothing.;48.183;-122.1136
Object emitted sparks like firewors and moved around sky erratically.;2004-07-09 21:58:00;>5 minutes;Object emitted sparks like firewors and moved around sky erratically. Single object moving erratically around the sky above treeline. Emitted multi colored sparks at first appearing to be fireworks but then moving in aerobatic patterns. Occurred along busy area of Interstate 5 at around mile post 215 (southbound) out to the east. Maybe 1500 - 2000 feet. At one point, two lights (not bright) appeared - separated like airplane engines. Object acted like remote controlled airplane but it was dark out and it didn't make sense how an RC plane could emmit brilliant fireworks in this way. Lasted at least 6-8 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  May have been aircraft with pyrotechnic generators mounted under the wings.  PD));48.183;-122.1136
3 dark spots in sky flying in formation, turned into 4 and dissappeared;2008-05-09 13:15:00;3 mins;3 dark spots in sky flying in formation, turned into 4 and dissappeared Driving south on I-5 just north of Arlington/Smokey point exit. Saw 3 dark spots against blue/partly cloudy sky maybe a half mile away. Couldn't make out tail or wings, flying in a formation heading what looked like southwest. 3 turned into 4, still flying in tight formation, ascended towards a cloud, flew into the cloud and I didn't see them again.;48.183;-122.1136
