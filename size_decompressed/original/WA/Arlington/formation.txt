3 pairs of glowing red/orange light formations New Years eve 2011 at midnight;2010-12-31 00:00:00;10 min;3 pairs of glowing red/orange light formations New Years eve 2011 at midnight About 5 minutes before new years three of us were on top of an rv getting ready to watch the fireworks, when in the sky to the south of us their appeared an orange light above the horizon. Thinking maybe it was a helicopter at first when another unblinking, slightly pulsating orange/amber light came behind the first following its flight pattern. When the first pair changed direction the second pair showed up behind the first, then the third pair appeared. All three pairs drifted through the same positions in the sky, from flying horizontal to vertically,( one above the other ). Then one pair after the other just kinda faded away. Minutes later we see an actual airplane flying from south to north, heading to Arlington airport. We then see one more of these orange lights fly parallel the the plane for a bit before hovering, and then drifting straight up and disappearing. Then a couple minutes later another two were moving to the north, further north then before. These were not airplanes or helicopters, no noise, no blinking lights.;48.183;-122.1136
