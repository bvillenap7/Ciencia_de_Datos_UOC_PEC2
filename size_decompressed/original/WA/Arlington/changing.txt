It changed shapes,ovals, triangles, diamond, and colors, blue, red, white, yellow. It lasted 20 minutes, then disappeared. At 3:20 a.m. I looked out the peephole in the door and saw a light outside. It looked far-away, it had trees in front of it. I had my brother look at it and he thought it was the moon. But I told him to watch it and he said it couldn't be since it was changing shape and color. I watched it and it kept getting smaller, then larger. When it got small it turned yellow and then it turned really dark outside. When it got big it started changing shapes an and colors, and outside got lit up. Then it disappeared. Then a couple minutes later, it came back and turned into a baseball field shape, there was a blue and red light coming off it. The middle was missing, like a ring. The object was white and lit up. Before it disappeard, it turned into a little tiny dot, then moved up out of my sight and disappeared. It hasn't been back since.;48.183;-122.1136
