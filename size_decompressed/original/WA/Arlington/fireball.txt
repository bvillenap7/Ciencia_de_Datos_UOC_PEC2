I saw lights over Mt. Baker;2001-03-15 16:31:00;10 to 15 Sec;I saw lights over Mt. Baker I am from Granite Falls, but happen to be in Arlington that day taking care of some business, and as I was comming home I was headed to highway 9 to come back to Granite Falls. When I glanced out my van window, and saw over the mountian one light than another. Yes I was by the airport, but this was not a plane. What I saw was one goldish floresent colored ball of light going down to the mountian it came from nowhere it was just there, the a second later another one, and it was over. I was driving so it made it hard to keep looking. It may of been flairs being sent up from the mountian out of the trees, but I don't know, and never will. I have saw other strange lights up in those mountians comming from the sky while camping, but always afraid people would say I was nuts, but I got brave this time fooy on what other peope think, I got brave this time, and will report anything I see from now on. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be serious-minded, and quite serious about her sighting.  PD));48.183;-122.1136
A green fireball going towards Granite Falls;2002-12-06 19:25:00;splt second;A green fireball going towards Granite Falls I had just moved to the outskirts of Arlington where I had rented a trailer on a friend's property. I had been in her home which is just next to the trailer. The property we are living on has a river running through it that is down below the home. Power wires go overhead. As I had just returned to my house that night when another one of her boarders hollered at me so I went back to the door and was talking to him. He asks me to wait a minute so I did. Out of boredom I looked over to the left through the trees when to my surprise a large blue green fireball streaked by and disappeared over the hill. It was only about a mile away to my estimation. I fully expected to hear an explosion or see a fire but there was nothing. I yelled for ((name deleted)) but it was too late, it all happened much to fast.;48.183;-122.1136

Fireball 11/21/19 6:30pm, observed from Arlington, WA, arcing across the sky to the north.;2019-11-21 18:30:00;3-5 seconds;Fireball 11/21/19 6:30pm, observed from Arlington, WA, arcing across the sky to the north. On 11/21/19 at about 6:30pm, I was driving north on I-5, just north of 236th exit 210, when a fireball shot across the sky moving east to west at about 40 degrees above the horizon. Yellowish orange in color, the fireball was much larger than a shooting star, it looked more like a close comet.  Visible longer than a shooting star, and lasting probably 3-5 seconds, with a much wider trail, the arc trail across the sky was probably 1/4 of the horizon! Brake lights appeared on several other vehicles on the freeway. There was no sound related to the event. This is the first fireball I have ever seen, though I enjoy stargazing and have viewed many shooting stars and satellites.;48.183;-122.1136
