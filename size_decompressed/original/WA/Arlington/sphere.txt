From where I live in Arlington, the UFO appeared over Darington, WA, ((to the northeast)) The craft moved very slow,  away from our perspective.  I ruled out a plane or chopper.  The craft moved quite slow.  Lights moved around the craft.   I got out the binoculars  and showed my wife and kids.  I may be wrong in understanding what it was we saw,  however,  it falls under the catagory of UFO as I understand it....  Maybe some kind of military OP. going on?

Orange orb light orange surrounding halo;2019-12-26 21:34:00;3 minutes;Orange orb light orange surrounding halo Object: At 21:34 PM, on December 26, 2019, I observed a large glowing orange orb surrounded by a light orange colored halo traveling in the night sky over land from Priest Point, Washington (just south of Tulalip Bay) north along the coastline to Warm Beach, Washington.  Originally I thought the object was an aircraft but after watching it for two minutes, I realized that I couldn’t see any navigational or landing/take-off lights.  I ran into my house, retrieved my binoculars, and was able to observe the object for at least five more seconds through the magnification of my 10X50 binoculars. The object was much closer by then to my location in the Seven Lakes area (Lake Goodwin).  I could now clearly see this was not any kind of civil aircraft. The orange orb without binoculars (seen with the naked eye) appeared to be the size of a dime.  Observed with the binoculars, the object was an orange ball encompassed with a lighter colored orange halo.  No discernable features of any type of aircraft were present, including wings, tail, fuselage, exhaust, or any type of lights.  The object was clearly not any type of civil aircraft.  The object didn’t appear to traveling at great speed.  It did appear to travel in a straight line at a constant moderate speed, with no discernable sound whatsoever.;48.183;-122.1136
