Told friend, got binocluars and looked at it through them, saw a round light, got up and went into house. Friend said she saw a face and body outline in window. Just went to bed, glanced out the window and saw a white/yellow light in the trees. Told my friend and got the binocluars to get a closer look, to make sure it wasn't the moon. Saw through the binoculars a round white/yellow light, partially blocked by the trees. My friend said she saw a face and body outline in the window. Not human looking. More she looked at it the more clear it looked. I have seen many UFO's around my  house. Believe to be possibly abducted. I have reported them through this network before. My friend has also seen UFO's before and believe to have been abducted. The light also had beams coming off it, like it would have to be bright, the area around the light, below, was lite up by it. There is a house right where this object was.;48.183;-122.1136

Rotating  white lights eminating from the sides with a red light in the middle;2001-08-17 21:30:00;2/3 min.;Rotating  white lights eminating from the sides with a red light in the middle I was at the Darrington classic rock festible with a friend, we were listening to one of the bands when I just happened to be looking up to the sky.  I noticed a small red light moving very slowly, at first I thought it was a plane until it stopped almost directly above where we were standing.  After about 30 seconds of staring at this object I made a comment to the person I was with, she in turn looked upward and saw said object.  This object seemed to have lights on both sides, 180 degrees apart, while it hovered above us it rotated back and forth so that these white lights made a sweeping motion in the sky.  After about 2 maybe three minutes said object moved straight up in the sky until it was barely visable and moved off towards the direction of the town of Darrington at a very slow speed until we could no longer see it.

Star-like light moving east from stationary position;2002-08-10 22:15:00;30 Seconds;Star-like light moving east from stationary position Me and a friend from Oregon were sitting out watching the stars when we noticed one of them move(after having observed said same for 10 minutes, indirectly).  It appeared as any other star, being in a line of 3 such lights.  Inclination was approximately 60 degrees to the eastern horizon, well clear of the hills to whichit disappeared behind. Visibility was excellant, with clear skies and no noticable cloud formations. Altitude seemed great, significantly beyond that of the aircraft travelling in standard routes over the area to the south and north from SeaTac, etc. No noise was heard from object, nor was it in what would be a normal flight path for a commercial a/c.  Other a/c were observed during this time and, unlike object in question, exhibited expected blinking and noise characteristics of known a/c. Object in question moved off to the east slowly but steadily.  If it were a normal a/c, I do not see how it could have maintained stationkeeping for ten minutes before moving off w/o noise.;48.183;-122.1136
-1MAG or brighter object low in north/northwestern sky moves downward about 2 to 3 deg growing fainter then disappears;2003-09-14 21:20:00;20 seconds;-1MAG or brighter object low in north/northwestern sky moves downward about 2 to 3 deg growing fainter then disappears Observed bright light (-1MAG or brighter) in north/northwest sky about 8-10deg above horizon. Instantly caught my attention because I was unaware of any star or celestial object approaching that illumination so far north of the ecliptic this time of year. Object was white to light blue in coloring and, initially, appeared to be stationary relative to landmarks and visible stars.  After several seconds of viewing noticed object (very) slowly drifting downward. Initially thought object was aircraft (Arlington Regional Airport is about 5 miles South of my location) as I often see approaching aircraft displaying landing lights. The object slowly moved roughly 2deg to 3deg downward toward the horizon rapidly becoming dimmer as it moved. After approximately 20 seconds it was too dim to be visible to the naked eye.  The object was not flashing, I could see no other lights of any color. The object did display a slight twinkle but it was not a prominent flicker. I could not discern a visible trail of any kind.;48.183;-122.1136

IT WAS TRAVELING EAST NORTH EAST,  AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AS A SATALITE,  FROM ABOUT 12 OCLOCK HIGH TO ABOUT 1 OCLOCK THEN SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED.

Two lights- no sound- being pursued by large military helicopter at low altidude;2007-02-22 19:45:00;30 seconds;Two lights- no sound- being pursued by large military helicopter at low altidude February 23, 2007 Arlington, Washington  I had gone to my back deck to have a smoke at 8:45 Pm last night. I heard what I thought was a lifeline (hospital), helicopter hovering over the nearby hospital. However the engines were too loud for a smaller search and rescue type helicopter. So my attention was drawn to see what was evidently on a path that would bring it very close to my house. As I looked to see what kind of helicopter it was, suddenly I noticed two bright lights traveling together in a straight path approximately a hundred feet apart. They were moving at least three hundred to four hundred miles an hour approximately a hundred and fifty feet in front of the helicopter. All three aircraft were traveling at only around three hundred feet in altitude. Directly in pursuit of the two lights was a very large, single rotor, obviously military helicopter with all of its flashing lights. The two lights made no noise, and had no other flashing or strobe lights- (proximity lights), just two star-like lights. I did not realize what I was watching until after the event. The two lights were traveling in a very straight path almost as if they were trying to elude the military helicopter, or possibly the helicopter was escorting them. The whole event only lasted for aproximately 30 seconds. It took three seconds for all aircraft to cross the night sky over my head. I could not make out any shape around each of the two unidentified lights I am not sure what I had just witnessed, but this was very unusual. I have been an Airworthiness Inspector for over twenty years and in aircraft for thirty, and I have never seen anything like this.

One star, in the Western sky, seemed brighter than all of the others.   As we were looking at it, we realized that it was moving very slowly.  At first, we thought it may be an airplane.  But we realized that it didn't have any red or blue lights, nor did it make any sound.  It was very bright steady light and larger than any stars we could see!   It continued on a straight path, heading East.  We watched until it disappeared behind some trees.  This had a very strange look to it and we all feel sure it was not an airplane.   Just not sure what it really was!   We captured it on a short video on my cell phone. But the quality is poor.;48.183;-122.1136

I was standing outside when I saw a glowing light moving across the sky.  There weren't any flashing lights like a plane would have so I was concerned.  As it neared the trees it slowed down almost to a stop and wobbled back and forth and proceeded to move forward and repeat this slowing and wobbling phenomenon until the trees blocked my view.

10-11 orange lights seen on 06 June, 2015, @ 10 PM, in Arlington, WA.;2015-06-06 22:00:00;20-30 seconds;10-11 orange lights seen on 06 June, 2015, @ 10 PM, in Arlington, WA. On June 6, 2015, at 10:00 PM, in Arlington, WA, I got out of my car to pump some gas at the Safeway gas pumps in Smokey Point.  As I turned north to walk behind my car, I saw several orange lights jump up into the sky very quickly, one after another.  Each one popped up within a second or less after the one before it.  I have photos of ten of them, but I think there was an 11th one that is not in the photo.  It seemed like there was a straggler. They stayed somewhat low above the horizon for about 30 seconds.  (You can get a good idea of this in the photos.)  I took a total of ten photos while they were in sight.  Then they suddenly turned to the east, (they had been heading south towards me, and I was slightly to the west of them) and flew out of sight pretty quickly.  There was no sound from them the entire time. These lights were much brighter and bigger than any star and much smaller than the Moon. You can get a sense of this in the photos.  I did not see any flashing lights, just steady, orange lights moving across the sky.  They did not have any of the lights that a typical airplane would have. I did consider the possibility that they could be Chinese lanterns.  However, they moved much too quickly and with too much control for that to be the case.  In my location, I wondered if they had taken off from the Arlington Airport, which is not a manned airport (it has automated landing).  That could have been approximately where they took off from, because they looked reasonably close.  However, they could also have taken off further north than that.  The lights were bright enough to be seen from a good distance. There was not a noticeable wind in the area at the time I saw this.  I think Chinese lanterns would have stayed around much longer, even if there had been a strong wind. When I expand the one photo of three lights, I can see the orange glow.  It’s not real clear.  I took the photos with my iPhone. However, you can get a sense of the color.

Infra red orb of light seen on security monitor moving strangely above the tree line.;2018-04-27 01:21:00;2 minutes;Infra red orb of light seen on security monitor moving strangely above the tree line. While monitoring my security cameras @ 1:21am 4/27/18, I noticed a strange orb of light moving strangely above the tree line looking east above Arlington, Wa.  I went out to the driveway and looked for it, but did not see it.  I went back and reviewed the video footage and the orb of light was in the exact area I was looking at.   Evidently, the IR night vision of the camera was picking up an infra red light source.  Just after I turned to come back inside, the light went straight up out of frame of the camera.  The light moved up, down, and sideways like a hobby drone.  It appeared to move over a large area and would have been hard to fly without visible lighting on it.  It was in view for about 2 minutes.;48.183;-122.1136

14 bright lights flying in trail.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-10 05:30:00;20 minutes;14 bright lights flying in trail I had stepped out on to my back deck at 0530 to smoke a cigarette, when I observed what at first I believed to be the ISS traveling from the NW to the SE in the pre-dawn sky. I then noticed another object of the same size and speed, in trail, of the first object and thought it must be a resupply module chasing the ISS in preparation for a rendezvous. I was somewhat startled to observe yet a third object trailing the first two, as I have never seen three satellite-like objects trail each other before. The roof of my house was obscuring the view to the NW, so I stepped farther out onto my deck and was shocked to see even more of these objects in trail of each other. Total of 14 objects, no sound, at satellite altitude, appeared to be satellites in trail. The first 6 or 7 seemed to be at an equal distance from each other, and the last 7 seemed to be somewhat staggered. These objects where just pinpoints of bright light, no navigation lighting observed, and moved across the sky at the constant speed of a satellite. I believe these objects were in orbit, and not high flying aircraft. I observed a total of 14 objects, but there may have been more before I went out on my deck.;48.183;-122.1136
