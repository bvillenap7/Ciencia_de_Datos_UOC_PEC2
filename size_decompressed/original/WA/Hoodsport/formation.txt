UFO'S OVER THE HOOD CANAL;2012-05-07 22:00:00;1 HOUR;UFO'S OVER THE HOOD CANAL At first we saw one bright colorful light.  It seemed to be the mother ship, because three white lights came from it.  They were going above the tree line back and forth on the other side of the Hood Canal. Then we noticed two white lights above our heads.  They were moving side by side.  I'm not really sure of exactly how many there were because they would disappear and reappear.  The one that was the brightest didn't go very far.  The smaller ones ventured out.  We have been watching for about one hour and my son and neighbors are still watching.  Its very exciting.;47.4264;-123.174
