It was traveling slowly with no typical aircraft navigation lights.  Within very few seconds another appeared behind it in the same flight path and then another until there were five.  Then it was as if they turned away one at a time and faded away.  Within seconds 3 more appeared  from the original location. They followed a simular path and then faded away as well.  My wife and 15 year old daughter saw them as well.  This continued for around fifteen to twenty minutes.  Through binoculars they looked like just orange fire balls reflected off what looked like a white sheet. We have seen this before several years ago in Mount Vernon Washington.  I believe it is a group of people with slow aircraft of some sort just giving a show but it is very strange.;48.2011;-122.378
