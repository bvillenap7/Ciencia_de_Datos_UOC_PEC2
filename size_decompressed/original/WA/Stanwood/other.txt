Low level, high speed flyby;1978-06-15 21:00:00;five seconds;Low level, high speed flyby A friend and I were driving down the West side of Camano Island on SW Camano Drive. Approximatly one mile South of the Elger Bay grocery store, an object crossed above the road at a height of no more than 50 feet above the treetops at a distance of about 300 yds in front of us. The object was low enough that I was only able to view it in profile. It had a wedge-shaped profile with a pointed nose. The object glowed with the luminous intensity of a fluorescent light. I was able to observe a glow on the trees and ground that helped me identify the distance as the object passed over. The object did not emit any sound that I detected. The size of the object appeared to be a wedge about 80 feet long and 20 feet high at the tail, viewed in profile. There was a small dark area about fifteen feet behind the pointed nose that may have been a window. As a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, I had developed the habit of taking a mental snapshot of an event, then analyzing it during the following moments, even while engaged in other activities. Due to this habit, I was able to compare its speed to my memory of a Phantom F-4 that I knew was flying at 600 knots at a similar range. Based on this comparison, I would estimate the speed of the object to be three times that of the F-4, or about 1800 knots. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to try to establish the exact date of the sighting.  PD));48.2011;-122.378
Hexagon image with 4 protruding spikes;2008-04-24 14:00:00;5 min.;Hexagon image with 4 protruding spikes I observed an object that appeared to be metallic and omitted no sound. It made what appeared to be horizontal and vertical movements. I took a picture of it and attached to this web site. When you expand the image you can clearly tell it has what looks like 4 points extending from it.;48.2011;-122.378
A knocking at the door, release of a warning of pending troubles ahead.;2009-07-16 19:00:00;1;A knocking at the door, release of a warning of pending troubles ahead. I've forwarded a sparate e-mail w/pitures of the event to you, maybe you should upgrade your information data registry to include pictures, if there are such to be had... just an idea. Take care, let me know what you think about the figure, you might even be able to discern a set of fingers on the long aspects of the arms being pulled into the upper portion of the photograph!
