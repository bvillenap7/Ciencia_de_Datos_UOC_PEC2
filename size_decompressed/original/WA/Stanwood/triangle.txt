I saw A large Triangle craft going from north to south from my living room window, it was the size of a aircraft carrier and looked to be traveling in and out of cloud cover, which I would guess at 12,000 feet with 3 white lights that looked the size of the moon. It was moving very slow with no noise. I was looking to see if it was going to appear from around my tree but it vanished in thin air. My dog did not bark and even the frogs kept up their noise.

triangular shape with lights on bottom hovered, then vanished in night;2003-10-31 18:10:00;5 seconds;triangular shape with lights on bottom hovered, then vanished in night Low flying, silent craft appeared to be hovering overhead in early dark sky.  triangular shape with lights on bottom with three lights running back, and one in middle.  As witnesses looked up overhead, it suddenly took off and disappeared, seemingly moving into the eastern sky (you could not see it go off into the distance, it just seemed to disappear).  Thought it might have been a craft from Whidbey Air Naval Base.;48.2011;-122.378
