very bright but contained light, unmoving;2002-08-11 23:00:00;1/2hr;very bright but contained light, unmoving My girlfreind and I were on our way home from the garlic festival in arlington and once we were east of stanwood, we saw a rather large light, we were traviling, so at first I thought it could be plane or something traveling at us since there were no blinking lights of any kind. but whene we pulled over and stopped we saw that it was not moving at all, if this thing were a helicopter, why was it staying so still and so high? and the light must have been 5 times the size of the copter, I,d never seen such a bright yet contained light. we also noted that there was no tower or any thing like that in the space this thing hoverd abouve ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

UFO spotted twice in one month (January 2006.)  Exactly like what was reported in 2003 in Snohomish.;2006-01-24 01:00:00;1.5 hours;UFO spotted twice in one month (January 2006.)  Exactly like what was reported in 2003 in Snohomish. First let me start by saying that another post that occured on 1/9/2003 is describing EXACT what we saw!  We have seen this object twice this month- 1/8/2006 and now most recently 1/24/2006. We saw it both times at S-SW from Stanwood..that would put it over north Everett or west Marysville (Snohomish County, WA).  It appears to be a bright light, making one think it's just a really bright star, but it was too bright.  Just when we are arguing w/ourselves, the object moved.  It would just hoover in the same spot and then would shoot off the to right, then come back to center and go to the left.  It had lights that were twinkling and they would get brighter as it was about to move in a direction.  Red blinking lights were spotted occasionally..but it was too far away to be clearly seen, we thought it resembled a V like shape. We thought- helicopter, but there was no noise on either occasion.  Then within 1/2 hour two planes passed the object and we watched totally fansinated because the object disappered.  No lights were seen when the planes approached the area of the object. After the planes passed the object reappeared and went about it's searching or scanning like manuevers.  Last night we noticed that the object made circular motions very quickly and that we had not noticed before, as well as little U shaped motions to the left and right.  The thing that is interesting is that this sigthing lasted (on BOTH occasions) for OVER 1 hour periods of time and relatively the same time and same location.  I just want the person who reported the first one over Snohomish in 2003- that we saw the same thing..TWICE now- several years later.  Not sure what it was..but we are sure of what it wasn't.;48.2011;-122.378
I notice a bright light like an airplane with its fog lights on.;2019-05-08 03:08:00;about 30 minutes;I want to send you this video. I work night shift.  So I am up at night.  At the time it was May so it was warm and I had my window open.  As I am watching videos online, I notice a bright light like an airplane with its fog lights on.  But it is fading randomly.  Like its loosing power or something.  It isn't making sound or getting any closer.  It is just there stationary in the sky.  So I go out in the front yard and film it.  And it is a white light like a bright star or high up plain coming head on.  But it's not going anywhere.  And it is just the one bright light.  But it is randomly fading in and out.  It doesn't have a pattern or other lights.  I have the video.  I want to know how to send it to you.  I watched it for 15 or 20 minutes before I went out into my front yard and made the 5 and some seconds video.;48.2011;-122.378

String of UFOs, 20+ points of light, one triangular formation, moving east. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-08-13 03:54:00;4 minutes;String of UFOs, 20+ points of light, one triangular formation, moving east. Primarily points of light, similar to stars, slightly brighter.  Roughly 20 of them in a line, spaced apart and staggered, with one triangular formation in the center. They were moving East at a gradual pace. I, the observer, had just arrived home from work, and I often look at the stars to appreciate their beauty.  I've seen plenty of satellites, shooting stars, and planes at night.  I've never seen a UFO.  And so I was surprised to see a new formation of stars in the sky, and even more surprised to see them moving. It had an unsettling effect on me, as the sight was so unusual and out of place.;48.2011;-122.378
