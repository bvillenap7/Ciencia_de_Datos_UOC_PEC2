Bright flash of light followed by a small egg shaped craft.;2014-09-28 20:30:00;4 minutes;Bright flash of light followed by a small egg shaped craft. My girlfriend and I were standing on our back patio watching a couple of planes go over and as it passed going north we noticed a flash of light in the sky and a egg shaped craft follow the airliner north then as the other plane passed the same thing happened then there was two more just alike all moving in a different direction, north, south, east, and west.  The reason we've been looking up is lately here in Washington every night it seems you can see something different.  I wonder what they are and what the bright flash of light is before they appear (a star gate maybe?) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
