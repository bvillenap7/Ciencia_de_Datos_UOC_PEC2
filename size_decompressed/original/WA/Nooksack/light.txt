Dancing light in the sky.;2020-05-14 03:30:00;5 minutes;Dancing light in the sky My son woke me up early this morning around 3:30 because he had wet the bed.  After I got him settled, the dog wanted out so I opened the door to our backyard to let her out.  I looked up to see the stars but there were none, except one in the northern sky. The object was blinking red, blue, and yellowish white.  I immediately thought it was odd that there was only one very bright star and then nearly immediately saw it glide to the left.  I continued watching it and as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I noticed that it was between the silhouettes of two nearby trees.  It continued to move side to side, up and down, dancing between the two trees.  There is no way a plane could dance in the sky the way this light did.  It continued dancing in the sky until it finally moved too far to the right behind one of the trees and I could no longer see it.;48.9264;-122.3158
