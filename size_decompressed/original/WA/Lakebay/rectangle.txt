Helicopter follows black rectangular craft near Tacoma WA;2021-06-28 22:50:00;15 to 20 seconds;Helicopter follows black rectangular craft near Tacoma WA I heard the rumble of a helicopter and waited for it to pass by my house. It was a clear but dark night. I noticed it pass my house from the west traveling east towards Tacoma, it was flying at about 2 to 300 ft , I noted the lights on the helicopter and a black mass about 4 times the size of the chopper. The black mass had no lights and appeared to be a rectangular craft. Since I live in a forested area, I could only view it for 15 to 20 seconds. I am use to seeing choppers from Lewis/McCord  but never have I seen one following a blackout object as tonight. If not for the helicopter, I don’t think it would have made a sound but I couldn’t be positive on that.;47.2875;-122.7741
