I opened the slider to let them outside, then noticed a strange cluster of lights in the sky, moving very slowly from northeast to southwest.  It appeared to be a singular object with multiple lights in a tight round cluster.  The lights were multicolored, bright blue, deep red, gold/orange/yellow and white, very vibrant and rapid twinkling with a bright intense pulse or flash of one of the red colored lights.   As I watched for about 5-10 seconds, it moved slowly to the south and the tree tops began to block my view.  I called for my husband to come see but when we both looked back it had moved out of sight. I have never seen an object like that before.  This was about 4 times the size and brightness of the largest star I’ve seen in the night sky.  I would guess its altitude to be about 2000-3000 feet, very difficult to tell.  It wasn’t low to the ground like the aircraft we typically see around here and it didn’t appear to be as high as the air traffic we see from SeaTac.  I don’t know what it was.;47.2875;-122.7741
