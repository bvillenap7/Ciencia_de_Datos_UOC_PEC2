A bright light orb, flies in a Z pattern.;1980-07-10 23:00:00;5 seconds;A bright light orb, flies in a Z pattern. I was laying in our back yard.  It was a clear night and I was looking at the stars. All of a sudden, this round light raced across the sky.  It appeared to be in our outer atmosphere.  The light was as bright as the stars, but the size, if I held a No. 2 pencil out, the size was the roundness of the eraser.  Measuring from where I was, it travelled a straight line about eight inches, and then stopped, and at an angle like a V, travelled another straight eight inches, and stopped, and a V again, travelled another eight inches, and then disappeared.  The pattern was a Z pattern. That is it.  I can not identify it.  It was way to fast for a helicopter, Jet, or even a rocket.  Plus it stopped for an instant and changed directions.  Twice.   So it was not a meteor, and it was not a satellite.;45.7855;-122.69

Our home sits along 3 rivers. We were sitting watching T.V. when my friend sat WOW!  I looked just in time to see a green ball fly through the sky and it looked like it landed in one of the rivers but can't be sure. The rivers: Columbia Lake Campbell.;45.7855;-122.69
