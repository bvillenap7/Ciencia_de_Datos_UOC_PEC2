A friend and I were driving to the corner store and noticed 3 reddish glowing lights in a perfect triangle formation.  They were approximately 500 to 600 square feet in size and were silently hovering just above the tree tops (cottonwood trees approximately 100 feet tall) on the west side of NE 29th Avenue as we were driving southbound, right before coming to the stop sign on NE 29th Avenue at NE 219th Street.   We had drove by it very slowly looking up towards it on the west side of NE 29th Ave and then continued on to the store, but in the short time of no more than 7 - 8 minutes they were gone when we drove back by the place we had just seen it.   We scanned the sky as we continued home a few blocks down from where we had seen it on NE 29th Avenue, but now we didn't see anything.  It was totally gone or was it just out of our eyesight? Where did it go in such a short time?   Oh and did I mention that there was not any engine type of sounds, that it was completely! silent when we first saw it and slowly drove past it with our pick up windows down.;45.7855;-122.69
