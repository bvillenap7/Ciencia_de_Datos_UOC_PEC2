Object flying next to full size airplane at same speed.;2018-04-26 16:40:00;20 seconds;Object flying next to full size airplane at same speed. On the evening of April 26, 2018, I was in our backyard, when I saw a airplane heading North from the Portland area when I noticed another object traveling at the same speed but was much smaller and trailing the aircraft. The smaller object had no visible angles or lines like the larger aircraft had and seemed strange to me since if it were a smaller plane it would have had some distinctive lines to the shape. I video taped it with my phone and when the video starts you can enlarge the picture to see this object which appears to be round in the video and not like a smaller plane.;45.7855;-122.69
