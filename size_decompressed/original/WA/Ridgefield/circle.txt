Object is orangish w/ a red light at the base, low, unmoving and it looks to have 4 shoots coming off the sides.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-22 11:30:00;15 minutes;The object is orangish w/ a red light at the base, low, unmoving and it looks to have 4 shoots coming off the sides. It is circular in shape with 4 shoots dangling out almost the shape of an abstract human like in hang man.  The color is an orangish yellow and it has been hanging in the sky(unmoving) for at least 15 minutes.  There is a red light at the base and every once in awhile it blinks. We know it is not a star as they are more white and much higher up.  I checked fb and other new sources but no one has mentioned it.
