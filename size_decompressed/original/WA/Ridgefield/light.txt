It was about twice this size of venus is this time of year. There was something very strange about it, I felt it knew I was watching it. I am located about 7 miles north of vancouver, washington at the fairgrounds exit to the east. Thankyou, ((personal data deleted)) About 9:35pm I took my dog outside to relieve himself when a BRIGHT object caught my eye--it was in the eastern sky, not very far away from me--seemed awfully close. At first I thought it was venus, then as I focused in on it I realized that it was much larger than venus, and much closer. As I focused on it, it quickly, faster than an airplane could, turned to the southeast, and as it did so, it's size became like a pin point. The strangest part of the experience was the feeling I got from it that it was fully aware of my presence. ((personal data deleted));45.7855;-122.69
Moving light in sky, flashes and causes sky to give the effect of rippling by Ridgefield, WA.;2004-06-30 19:00:00;30 seconds;Moving light in sky, flashes and causes sky to give the effect of rippling by Ridgefield, WA. The event occurred in 2004 when my father, my brother and I were driving from Vancouver, WA, to Woodland, WA.   It was dark, and a clear, starry night.  I glanced out the window, looking over the farmlands and Tri-Mountain Golfing Course to the east and began to watch a slow-moving light, not unlike an airplane, moving in the far distance.  Unexpectedly, a strange, horizontal light emanated from the light.  The sky gave the impression of rippling with the light.  After the event, the object vanished.
