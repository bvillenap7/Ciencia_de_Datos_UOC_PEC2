They reported it came from the west to the east across the sky.   We live in So. Richland, WA and they saw it out of the bedroom window.  They said it did not look like an airplane.   Anyone else see this?  The girls are adamant....  Who knows..... I believe them...  They both both said it was very strange;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
Large orange light over Franklin County WA;2012-07-31 21:00:00;10 minutes;Large orange light over Franklin County WA On the evening of Tuesday July 31, 2012, I saw a single large light floating light in the sky to the east from where I live in Richland WA.  It was between nine and ten pm and dark enough that I could not see the body of the object, just its lights against the dark sky.  The object was on the other side of the Columbia River over Franklin County. It moved very slowly and with no well-defined direction.  The shape and color of the light seemed to change but over all the color appeared to be orange. This was similar to the report included in the Tri-City Herald of August 2 except that I did not see individual lights.  What I thought distinguished it from an aircraft were its 1) very slow speed, 2) very large light, and 3) the color of the light, which was not a well-defined white or red.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825

Was woken up by my dogs barking and then heard the jets.  Did not go outside to look.   Not sure if it was some sort of military training or we were under attack and the jets were chasing something?;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
