July 11  Friday July 10th, 2020, my husband and I were outside setting up telescope.  We saw a very bright white light in our eastern skies.  Not very high in the sky.  It would move slowly and jerky.  The object moved behind trees.  We walked around looking for a better view.  Then we looked towards the west and saw a very bright white light, again.  We could make out 3 horizontal white lights.  This craft was not moving fast, nor did it have flashing, colored lights like planes have.  What did we see?;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
