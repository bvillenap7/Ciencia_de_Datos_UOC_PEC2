Twenty minute observation of a silver and black disk performing hawk-like maneuvers.;2003-07-27 11:00:00;20 min;Twenty minute observation of a silver and black disk performing hawk-like maneuvers. THIS IS AN UPDATE TO CORRECT SPELLING... As a spectator at the annual hydroplane races, several airshow performances were offered for Saturday and Sunday, July 27th and 28th.  On Sunday the 28th, at 11am a pair of trainer jets had just finished their demonstration and flew off to the West up-river and over Richland, WA.  I followed them with my binoculars (Pentax 8x42s) thinking that they may turn and make another run for the spectators.  They didn't.  Instead they turned south as if heading toward Oregon.  They were in level flight and apparently taking a direct route to wherever their destination was.  As I followed them in my binocs, a black shape passed through my field of view from south to north.  For a moment I thought it was a large bird, so I stopped tracking the jets and turned back to the object.  It couldn't have taken more than one or two seconds, at most, to find the object.  However, it had turned from black to a silver color, no black was visible.  The object maneuvered in a manner I have described as a hawk scanning a field looking for prey.  The hawk will glide and turn, tipping its wings such that the observer can see the back (topside) of the hawk for a moment, then turn the other way and expose the underside of the bird.  This was very similiar to the movements of this flying machine.  As I steadied my binocs as much as possible, I could make out more and more detail.  The object was a very distinct disk.  There were no bat-wing, delta-wing contours.  In fact it appeared to be a classic flying saucer shape.  That notwithstanding, I continued to observe.  When the bottom side was turned towards me, I could see that the disk was perfectly round and perfectly black with a very thin ring of silver or white around the edge of the disk.  The blackness of the bottom obscured whatever details might have been present (other than the ring).  When the disk turned on edge I could see the craft had some thickness.  And as it continued to rotate to the topside I could see a distinct transition from the edge to a raised ! middle section and a cockpit in the center of the disk.  The cockpit appeared to be of a teardrop shape - not symmetrically round as the rest of the craft appeared to be.  The pointed portion of the cockpit appeared to be the front, but that was more of an impression than anything else.  As the craft continued to maneuver, with the view transitioning from black to silver and back again, it generally drifted in an easterly direction.  When I first spotted the craft, I estimated it at about 240 degrees azimuth and maybe 25-30 degrees elevation.  By the time I lost sight of it, it was probably at about 210-220 degrees and maybe 30-35 degrees elevation.  When I first spotted the craft, I immediately thought that it was part of the airshow and was waiting off in the distance for its turn for a demonstration.  The pilot of the craft looked as though he was having fun.  Lazily sliding and gliding up and down an imaginary slope of some kind just enjoying the ride.  But as time wore on, I began to think it might have been some kind of super-secret military prototype that the pilot was putting through its paces - sort of just practicing.  Further, since I had no frame of reference from which to judge the crafts dimension, I could not absolutely determine its distance from my observation point.  The two other witnesses sitting near me looked at the craft both with the naked eye and with my binocs.  It was difficult to see the craft with the naked eye because of what appeared to be its great distance.  One witness after looking through the binocs and then observing directly commented - ...man, that thing is really up there....  Oserving with the naked eye was difficult.  The observer had to know where-to-look, but when we looked at the right spot, the black disk was easily discernable and the silver side would flash brightly when the sun hit it at the right angle.  It was an altogether amazing experience, and an amazing object.  Finally, after observing for so long, I began to feel fatigued, and put my binocs down to see if I could arrange a more comfortable and steady rest from which to observe.  I may have spent 5 minutes re-arranging things and when I returned to observe, the object was gone.  As I thought about what I had seen I tried to imagine the possibilities.  First, it could have been a UFO, I guess - whatever that actually means.  Secondly, I think the most likely explanation is a secret military plane of some kind.  And finally, I have to admit that it could have been some kind of a model or ballon - perhaps a hovercraft of some kind that could maneuver as it did.  The only thing that makes me hesitate to believe this possibility is that it appeared to be incredibly high for a model and it stayed in position for a very long time.  Also from my position and given the size of the Columbia river, the model would have to have been at least three miles away.  That seems very far to have been able to see what might be a 2-3 foot diameter model disk. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptional witness.  He was very objective about the sighting he reports above, and he has considerable training and experience as an engineer.  He was totally flabbergasted by the sighting, he reported to us.  We have encouraged him to try to locate other witnesses in the area.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness later corrected the date to July 27th.  We have amended the date above.

About 7PM, I walked out my garage side door and noticed 3 circular shaped objects with orange lights in a triangle formation.;2014-11-25 19:00:00;10 minutes;About 7PM, I walked out my garage side door and noticed 3 circular shaped objects with orange glowing lights in a triangle formation.  All three were moving from north to south.   There were high clouds at the time and all 3 craft were below them.  They crept across the sky very slowly and I was able to take a picture as well as have my wife watch as well.   The northwest craft went straight up throughs the clouds and disappeared but not before I snapped a picture.  The northeast craft disappeared about 45 seconds later in the same manner and the southern most craft waited an additional 2 minutes before ascending through the clouds.   I have never seen anything like this before and had to tell someone.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
Multiple craft, long duration event.;2016-01-01 00:04:00;15 minutes;Multiple craft, long duration event Right after going outside in my back year to watch fireworks with my wife, we both noticed what appeared to be a military style formation of initially 6 separate craft.  All craft were in an almost straight line and evenly spaced, except for the first craft, which was about 3 times further ahead then the rest of the craft were spaced.   More craft appeared when the lead craft went out of sight.  There was no noise present and the craft appeared to be at about 30,000 feet and flying north east from the south west.  From my vantage point, they were straight up from a hill, directly to the south of my home.   Every craft flew the exact same pattern and were extremely slow.  The last craft took 8 minutes to traverse the same path the previous traveled in less time.  All craft disappeared at the exact same location.   There was a low cloud bank but was only partially covering the skies.   The path the craft were flying through was not clouded and had very good visibility.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
bigger than 2 football fields, lightning white lights flashing all the way around and red lights flashing all around the white lights;2017-02-12 22:53:00;1 minute;Huge circular UFO hovering above neighborhood on the intersection of McMurray and Jadwin streets, bigger than 2 football fields, lightning white lights flashing all the way around and red lights flashing all around the white lights, myself and a Richland police officer slowed down to watch the craft and after about 1 minute the craft disappeared. There was no sound coming from the craft and it was hoving at approx. a 60 degree angle.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
3 events of multiple UFO’ a with 1/2 hour span;2021-05-16 23:10:00;.5 hour;3 events of multiple UFO’ a with 1/2 hour span Event 1) 23:00 hour around 50 or 60 UFO’s right behind each other but slightly scattered went north. Flying VERY close together. Not drone like flight they’re were constant distance and maybe a few off the “line formation” they then got too far to see 2) 23:15 (approx) around maybe 25 lights flying farther apart Coming from the SW but disappearing over our area. Lasted about a min 3) 23:20 UFO’s appears same as (2) but this time there were more than 40.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
