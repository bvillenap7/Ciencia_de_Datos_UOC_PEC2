I was driving to the store, heading east and the moon was half full, but just the underbelly of the moon, and I saw what I thought was a street lamp, but it was moving kinda side to side.  came to a stop past trees and what not, and just below the moon the object waivered side to side, then up and down and the just shot like a bullet out, it was like watching a tail of a comet, but it was split seconds.  nothing moves like that...I literally freaked out and pulled over and called my fianc√©e and said you have no Idea what I just saw.....I swear......nothing I know of moves that way, or can leave that fast....;46.2868607142855;-119.295825

They grew closer and closer to me, the more I drove, then within seconds were to the right of me.  I attempted to get my phone which had gone dead due to overheating (very odd) and nearly burnt my hand.  As I threw the phone down in pain the objects were then to the left of me.  A bright light shined in front of me like floodlights (it was day time yet still very very bright) and I threw up and had a headache for the next couple of hours.  After I left the event I noticed am odd symbol on the car resembling a cave and arrows surrounded by a circle.   My cat in the car who is normally docile went insane and the electrical gauges on the car stopped working as this all happened.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
