It was moving really slow, had windows in the center, and was a very shiny. (It stood out like a sore thumb in the gray clouds.)  We were just kind of in ah of it and stood in the water watching it go by. it was shaped between and ovel and egg like shape.  If I could draw it here for you I would.   Over the years my husband and I have seen quite a few over the handford reach area and over the columbia river. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
