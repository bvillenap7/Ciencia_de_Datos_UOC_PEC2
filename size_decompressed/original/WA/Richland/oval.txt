Then shot straight up into the air at a amazing speed, leaving a trail 10/27/07  To whom it may concern,    On September 26th 2007 we have witnessed two different unexplained UFO sightingâ€™s by two separate people.  One person has photos  and the other has video.   The video is astonishing and overwhelming.  It is not any sort of plane any of us have seen.  The speed and direction it moved in was nothing any of us have seen.  It appeared on a clear full moon evening.  It hovered directly in front of the full moon.  It was a bright blue round shaped object.  It hovered for some time and then shot straight up into the air.   Who should we contact to see the photos and the video?  We are very serious about this. Please advise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have requested copies of the photos and video.  PD));46.2868607142855;-119.295825
5 bright lights in the sky over the Columbia River.;2016-07-09 21:30:00;30 minutes;5 bright lights in the sky over the Columbia River Looking west from our backyard last night, there were anywhere between 2 to 5 oval shaped white lights going in various patterns above us in the sky.  One would go right, while 4 may go to the left.  Two would stay lower, while the other two would shoot up and join the singular one.  Sometimes some would blink off & on, while others stayed white.  At times they would go in a complete circle.  There was no noise with their presence.   The only thing we had to try and get a picture was, an IPad.  They did not come out well as there is no zoom lens on it.  The other person observing this went to get his LED flashlight that is very bright, to see if he could replicate the lights in the sky.  They could not.  What was in the sky was far beyond the capability of our flashlight.  But within 30 seconds of shining our light towards the sky, they came together, stopped all motion, and then vanished.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
