It was moving slowly and was not a shooting star or the lights on a plane.  It was about 10 times larger than the brightest star in the sky.  It was traveling horizontally and remained in sight about 8 - 10 seconds before it went out. I was on our deck about l0:00 pm leaning back in a lounge chair and looking up at the night sky.  A bright light suddenly apeared directly overhead travelling from the northwest towards the southeast.  It looked just like a bright flash of light that remained in sight much longer than a flash should is the best I can describe it. It was in my sight for about 8 - 10 seconds.  It was moving steadily and not very fast like a shooting star would travel.  It was one large light about the light density and size of 10 times the brightest star in the sky at the time. The distance that it travelled was equal to the distance from my index finger to my thumb held at arms length.  It appeared instantly, moving slowly, and then went out instantly. I live near a small airport and have seen airplanes fly over my house at night so my first thought was that it was a plane. I then realized I had never seen a light on a plane that was that big or that bright, or a light that turned on and then turned off like that.  It was travelling away from the airport and not towards the direction of the airport. I could not hear a plane and can hear the planes that take off and come in to land that pass over my house. We recently had 4th of July fireworks going off around town and it was not like a flare, rocket or fireworks--it did not go up and then down.  It appeared to be high, directly overhead and moved horizontally in a straight line before it disappeared.  It did not disappear from going out of sight into the distance but seemed to just turn off while still directly overhead.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
bright light, white, with hints of gold.;2004-04-10 22:25:00;20 mins;bright light, white, with hints of gold. This was a very bright light above, well above, the tree tops, possibly 1-5 miles distant.  I'd say it was about half the size of a dime held at arm's length.  Far too  bright to be a star, it caught my attention immediately as I was taking the dog out in the yard.  My exact reaction was What the hell?  I moved around the yard, watching it in relation to trees, poles, etc., and could see that it was bobbing and weaving gently (rocking motion).  I planted my feet firmly and studied it in relation to stars, and it was the only thing moving.  I finally went into the house and told my wife, I know you're not going to believe this, but there's a UFO out the back.  She said, Sure, Sure.  I asked her to come look, and she said, I cannot even believe I'm getting up for this.  But as we got out back, she watched it for a bit and admitted she couldn't really say what it was.  I went in and got a small digital camera and snapped a few pictures of it.  The best shows a round object with 'spiral arms' of light coming off it.  I also took a brief 'movie' but have not had a chance to put it on the computer.  On the camera, it appears blank.  About 15 mins later, my wife and I left to pick up our daughter from a dance.  I said, Well, if it IS a star or planet, it will be there when we get back.  If it's gone, we'll know it was something else.  We returned by 11:15 and it was no where in the sky.  I climbed the high back porch on our house and scanned the entire horizon and there was nothing.  If this had been a star or planet, it could not have 'gone down' in such a brief span of time.  I'm a meteorologist, and habitually study the sky.  I feel I'm a pretty good observer.  I couldn't call this a 'flying saucer' but it was certainly something airborne that was not identifiable as anything conventional. I will submit the pictures via email as soon as I can get them transferred to the computer.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
A small silvery object seen go 0-5000 mph in a blink of an eye, in Richland Washington.;2006-08-25 12:00:00;1 minute;A small silvery object seen go 0-5000 mph in a blink of an eye, in Richland, Washington. Walking in Howard Amon park with two friends around noon.  The sky was all blue and the sun was high above me.  Looking over towards the I-182 bridge I noticed a bright light in the sky.  Like a star and silver but within our atmosphere. I stopped in my tracks and waited for it to move thinking it might of been a plane reflecting light.  The object did not move for nearly 20 seconds as I watched. I walked over to my friend and tapped him on the arm and said hey do you see that.  As I pointed at the object the unbelievable happened.  RIght when my fingertip aligned with my eye and the object it sped away at a rate of speed I couldn't not guess. But, If I know a plane fly's at about 300-400 mph, the object I saw was going at about 5000 mph.  It sped away south.  Neither of my friends saw it.  I am the only witness. The owner of a restaurant near the park also has a sighting reported on here at a later date about 500 yards from where I saw mine.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
Strange light falls slowly in a spiral;2008-06-28 00:15:00;5 seconds;Strange light falls slowly in a spiral First off, I don't have word processor. Delete it if you want, I felt obligated to write this. first off, I dont believe in UFOs. I find it unfeasible and unreasonable for a craft to come here. At about 12:10 AM, I saw an odd siting. I was simply sitting on my couch playing a video game, trying to fall asleep, when I saw a light outside my window. I figured it was a star, but when I looked up, it appeared to be falling. I assumed it was a shooting star, so I tried to catch it fast. I then realised the light was fish tailing. It was falling down in a spiral fashion, not leaving a streak or anything behind it. It did not get dimmer, start to flicker, or do anything abnormal, other than spiral.  I do not know if the direction I am looking is north, but I do know that to the north of our city there is plutonium tanks that are submerged in the sand in one of the cities above us. Whether that has anything to do with it, I do not know.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
Orb light that just fades out and disapears;2010-07-11 00:00:00;1min;Orb light that just fades out and disapears There is something flying out here over our skies and you can almost see them nightly.  There are these orbs I have seen with other witness's that appear and get really bright and hover for a few seconds and then just fade away into the darkness of night?   I have seen it numerous times and I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this?;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
White orb speeding across the sky in eastern Washington.  ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports to news.  Meteor?  PD));2013-10-30 05:58:00;10 seconds;White orb speeding across the sky in eastern Washington. My girlfriend and I stepped out on the front porch to smoke.  We spotted a single glowing odd white light moving east to west at an incredible speed.  It maintained a single altitude and went from horizon to horizon in under 10 seconds.  It was completely silent. I estimated the altitude at 4-5,000 feet.  There was a tail behind the object.  It seemed to glow, and the event left us both in awe and shaken.  It was almost disturbing due to the unnatural nature of the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports to news media.  Possible meteor, we suspect.  PD));46.2868607142855;-119.295825

Peeked out of the shutter and saw exactly what was in the last video.  Got the binoculars.  It was brighter with almost a turquoise light wth red and white lights as well.  Too high to be on the mountain and it was still there when I looked again 20 minutes later.   Saw it again a few months later and again from the other side as I drove in from Portland about 3 am.  These videos all shot from different locations and submitted by others at different times.   I scoured Youtube looking for evidence of other sightings in Tri cities and this is the result.  Insomniac prankster with a drone and too many batteries in the garage?  You tell me.  I have no clue what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

Two soft yellow glows of light fly off into different directions and then disappear.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-01 00:05:00;2 minutes;Two soft yellow glows of light fly off into different directions and then disappear. Two lights flying next to each other slowly.  The lights were like a soft yellow glow but much darker yellow than the normal plane lights we see.  One of the lights zoomed off into a random direction and disappeared and the other one slowly faded away.  Then a few moments later they same light appeared but only one instead of two. Then it disappeared.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
Pattern of lights in the midnight sky.;2018-02-28 00:20:00;15;Pattern of lights in the midnight sky. I was out on my back patio smoking a cig.  I thought I saw our city helicopter lights then I stood there and watch a second air craft approach I told my boyfriend to look and then all of a sudden the lights on the aircraft start flashing in weird patterns.  my boyfriend said they probably refueling a plane, i said no not with those type of lights.   I got freaked out and continued to watch from the kitchen window.  Then all of a sudden they were gone.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
Lights in formation traveling rapidly across the sky.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-18 05:30:00;10 minutes;Lights in formation traveling rapidly across the sky Early on the morning of Mar. 18 (?), I went outside to see the crescent moon and a couple of planets aligned in the southeastern sky.  As I was waiting for the moon to make its appearance, I looked around and noticed a light about the same magnitude as the stars around it moving very rapidly across the sky.  Within a few seconds, I sighted several other lights traveling at the same speed and direction.  They were lined up across the sky, about distance between the pointer stars and the North Star apart, heading more or less southeast from the Big and Little Dipper toward the southeastern horizon.  As I was watching them, two lights seemed to be doing crisscrosses with each other.  These were the only two that were not in formation.  This continued for several minutes with new lights appearing as those near the horizon disappeared.  At first, I thought they were airplanes taking off from Seattle (SeaTac) but when I saw the crisscross, I thought that was unusu! al for airplanes.  So, I chalked it up to sunlight reflecting from the bottom of supersonic jets.  However, just a couple of days ago, I was walking the dog at about 9-10 pm and noticed several lights in the same formation traveling in the same direction.  Now I’m really wondering what they are!;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
