I was in shock at first, then thought if I ran back inside an grabed my sister it won't be just me seeing this... so I did, an she was awaken an came running out in time to see the tail end heading north west above the columbia river then north an out of eyesight. the size was hard to grasp an no sound it was amazing.  Then Sunday I heard that on the westside there had been some events...I'm wondering if it's our's [hard to beleive] on patrol or what?  I'm not up during the night or outside late to look at stars...I won't be the same now that this has happened;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
Triangle over Richland, WA;2005-12-05 17:25:00;30 seconds;Triangle over Richland, WA At about 17:25, I was catching a ride from the office with my co-worker.  As we pulled into a quiet neighbourhood where I live, I noticed two lights overhead, pretty bright but not blinding. They seemed like regular airplane lights.  However, as we continued driving, about 10 seconds later the object was right above and to the right of our car, giving me a perfect view.  It seemed huge. To be honest, I've never seen anything like that before. It was triangular-shaped, with 3 dim blue lights at each tip, with a steady-glowing red one in the center.   It slowly howered over the car at about 1,000 feet and gave me the strangest feeling.  Awe is a good word to describe it, I think.  This is the first time I've seen something I could not rationally explain. It made no sound whatsoever.  My friend, who saw it but couldn't observe it well enough due to the fact he was driving, suggested it was an airplane.  When we stopped not even 10 seconds later to get out of the car and have a better look at it, it has already vanished.  What puzzles me, is the fact that it was moving so slowly, that it should have been still right above us when we got out.  The skies were clear, and there are no big trees in the neightbourhood to obstruct the view. There is a pretty big Interstate highway junction (actually, currently under construction for expansion) half a mile away. The object reminded me of the famous Triangles seend in Belgium in the 90's.  To this moment I'm in a state of excitement, for this is the first time in my life I saw something I could not explain.  A true UFO encounter :);46.2868607142855;-119.295825

The triangle was very bright!  Red/orange in color.  Every square foot of the bottom of the craft looked like molten metal, like an acetylene torch heating up steel.  I watched the craft silently float on by for about 1 minute and travel about 20 miles until it was out of sight. I know this, because I drive that main direction to work and have lived in this area for over 40 years.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
Triangles in formation;2021-05-20 18:36:00;1 min;Triangles in formation I was sitting on my back patio which has a view northward over the Columbia River and into Franklin County, Washington and beyond. I spotted 5 objects flying in a formation in a sweeping motion in what I can best describe as a Blue Angels air show display. The objects were triangular shaped, without visible wings, nose, or tail, and reflected the sun each time they turned making them highly visible.  The weather was partial sun with clusters of low rain clouds.  The objects flew in complete unison, turning together at exactly the same time going side to side (east to west). I observed for approximately 10 seconds and asked my spouse if she could see them. She did. We watched for approximately another 10 seconds and I ran into the house to get our phones. She continued to watch for approximately 20 seconds as the objects continued to move in complete unison, turning together like a school of fish and they were much faster than an airplane covering a large dis! tance. The objects were many miles away, and moved quickly. There is an airport in the area and the objects did not behave like planes in the air. There are birds in the area and the objects did not behave like birds. When I returned with the phones approximately 20 seconds later I could not locate them on the phone screen as I attempted to record. My spouse looked down at her phone to begin recording and could not locate the objects again when she looked up. I have a flight tracker app on my phone and I checked it. The nearest plane to us at the time was above Sunnyside WA, approximately 40 miles west.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
