Feb 16, 8:30PM, Blue / Green fireball moving NW to SE over Southeastern Washington State;2003-02-16 20:27:00;10 sec;Feb 16, 8:30PM, Blue / Green fireball moving NW to SE over Southeastern Washington State While driving home around 8:30pm on Sunday 2/16/03 a flash caught my attention.  I observed a blue green fireball moving roughly from the NW toward the SE and possibly desending.  It was quite bright and had a firey tail.  It dimmed momentarily and then was bright again.  I lost sight of it behind a hill.  The reason I thought it may be desending is I never saw it reappear from behind the hill. After the sighting I took a better look at the sky.  The sky had a thin layer of clouds with some stars showing. In my opinion the object was below the cloud layer.  My two daughters were in the car with me.  They saw a bright flash which got their attention but did not have a clear view of the object. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I was looking toward the south.  It was moving from right to left.  I would say it's angle of descent was 30 to 40 degrees  ((name deleted)) ((END));46.2868607142855;-119.295825
4 orange orbs, fireballs over bridge;2012-09-07 21:45:00;5 minutes;4 orange orbs, fireballs over bridge My wife and I were just just starting to cross the 182A bridge going east between Richland and Pasco, Washington, at approx. 21:45 hours, when I spotted 4 orange glowing orbs in a row approx. 50 to 100 feet apart.  They looked to be around 100 to 200 feet above the bridge.  I pointed them out to my wife and she saw them to and said they are planes.  I said no, there are no red or white flashing lights and they are to close and they are staying still. I couldn't stop due to crossing bridge at 70 MPH. Once on other side we turned around on overpass and went back.  As we approached I watched the lights disappear liked the turned off a switch.  There is nothing above the bridge (wires, railing, power lines).  I then drove to access under the bridge and looked around and saw nothing.;46.2868607142855;-119.295825
