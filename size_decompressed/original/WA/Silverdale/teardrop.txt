My husband and I were driving home when we saw one tear shaped object. It was at a distance. I saw a bight blue/green light pause and then was gone in a second. There was no cloud coverage and I know that it was to large to be a comet or meator, plus it paused. I am a housemaker and my husband is in the U.S. Navy .;47.6621;-122.6981
