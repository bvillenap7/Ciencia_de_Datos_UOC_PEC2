A friend and I were walking around our neighborhood at night when we saw a strange looking object in the sky. At first, when it was coming towards us, it looked like a boomerang shape. When it was in this shape, the left side of the craft had several non-blinking lights that were blue. The right side was virtually the same except the lights were red. In the middle, there were several diamond shaped white lights that also did not blink. As it passed over our heads, it seemed to be moving more slowly than a regular aircraft. Also when it passed over head, instead of a boomerang shape, it appeared to be triangular. about a second after it passed over our head,the blue lights went out. it started to turn slowly vertically while it was moving. When it was almost completely vertical i thought it seemed to be diamond shaped. I am not entirely sure because it was dark. then as soon as it came near us, it seemed to be across the sky in about five or six seconds. At t! hat point, i realized the portable video game system in my pocket had a camera and I took it out and snapped a picture. I would send the picture but I do not have an SD card to transfer the photo to my computer. But in the picture i could make out a huge diamond shaped light and a small red blinking light in the front. I thought it was very strange that the object went through so many changes.;47.6621;-122.6981
