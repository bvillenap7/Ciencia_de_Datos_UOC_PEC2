Strange glowing objects and a fireball.;2000-07-17 20:50:00;21:15;Strange glowing objects and a fireball. At about 22:50 I went onto my patio to smoke, I noticed strange lights to the west of me over the Olympic mountains. There were 4 of them very bright orangish in color. As I continued to watch them I could tell they were moving down very slowly. When the second to last one was gone I saw a bright flash behind the mountain, like an explosion, about 15 minutes after the last light was gone. I saw a bright streaming orange fireball coming from the south to the north, I first saw it around the Mountain called The Brothers. This light had a tail on it, unlike a com trail though, it stayed directly behind the object as it moved and never decreased or increased in size and it was moving to slow ot be a meteor, As it moved to north and its altitude decreased it decsended behind the other mountain that the other lights were behind. At this time I noticed a helicopter in the area. At about 21:30 the helicopter flew away from the area and flew directly over my town at an altitude of about 500 feet. I could clearly see that it was not civilian but a blackhawk. I also took 12 pictures of both sightings and I will send them to the Reporting Center as soon as I get them developed.;47.6621;-122.6981
