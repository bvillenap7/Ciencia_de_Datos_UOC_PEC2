At 3:10 PM on Sunday (Fathers Day) my wife, my 30 year old son, and I witnessed a black rectangular shaped object fly in a straight line and constant speed from south to north almost directly over Silverdale. The rectangle was flying with the long sides leading and trailing. There was absolutely no sound, identifying features, or lights. Since it was just a black rectangle in silhouette it is extremely difficult to estimate the size of the object or the altitude. But I believe it was a large object that was quite high. I would estimate the speed as being roughly equivalent to that of a jet fighter cruising at about 10,000 feet. I am 66 years old, a former Air Force aircrew member, and I hold an FAA Flight Instructors rating. I am not a UFO nut. I have seen just about everything that has flown in our skies since the early 1940's and I can say with 100% confidence that this object was totally anomalous. My wife and son are totally rational, dependable people. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to be quite credible to us.  PD));47.6621;-122.6981
