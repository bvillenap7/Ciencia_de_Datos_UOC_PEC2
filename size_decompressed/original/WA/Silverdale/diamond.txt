Diamond shaped white and red lights over Bangor, WA.;2007-09-15 01:30:00;20 sec;Diamond shaped white and red lights over Bangor, WA. I am in the Navy and assigned to the security detatchment at Bangor submarine base in Silverdale, WA.  I was on post and was talking to two of my coworkers when the following happened.  I had gone to patrol a restricted area and was on my way out when I decided to stop and talk with the sentry.  I was facing a road leading up a hill and into a heavily wooded area when I saw a very large diamond shaped object with large white lights at the points and small red lights inbetween them.  It had a total of eight lights all together.  It rose above the tree line, turned, and dove back down.  It reminded me of a breaching whale. What struck me as strangest was that there was absolutely no sound.  For as large as it was I thought there should have been some noise from the engines.  I immediately turned to the person I was talking to to ask them if they had seen it, and he was still looking in the direction of the object.   I stayed and we talked about what we had seen for about a half an hour before continuing on with patrol.  I headed up the hill and decided to check out a construction site that was in the woods where they were building a new energy monitoring station, to see if there was anything to account for what we had seen.  When I arrived the first thing my partner and I noticed was that the huge stadium lights that were always on were out.  The next morning we learned that the lights had shorted out because of an unexplained spike of magnetic interference. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
