Spherical object travelling south, intermittently flashing/reflecting yellowish/whittish light in varying intensity.;2006-04-05 16:46:00;less than 1 min.;Spherical object travelling south, intermittently flashing/reflecting yellowish/whittish light in varying intensity. Metallic spherical object travelling south, close to zenith, in straight course then turned east. Intermittently flashing/reflecting yellowish/whittish light in varying intensity and luminousity. Too high to be an aircraft (fixed or rotary and no sound and contrail), too low to be a satellite (besides it's still daylight), too big to be a mylar balloon but going against prevailing winds? Cannot locate again after I change position.;47.6621;-122.6981
3 Red/Orange orbs that blinked out.;2014-10-04 23:03:00;3-4 minutes;3 Red/Orange orbs that blinked out I was out side smokeing looking to the Nw skies when a bright red/orange light I thought to my self that's to bright to be a plane when I walked into the road to get a better look I saw another object just as bright they were traveling side by side at lest 2-4 miles part flying in unison I then quickly got my dad my 2 brothers and my mom the objects were traviling in a SW direction then the left object blinked out and a few sec later the 2nd object blinked out  just as the 2nd object blinked out a 3 object came from the same direction as were I saw the 1st 2 objects the 3 rd object traveling twice as fast covered the same distance in just a few sec then blinked out I mind u that these objects were makeing absolutely no sound and moving to fast to be a plane or a helicopter.  Scared ((deleted)) me I'm still a little shaky writing this forgive the language I for got to add just prior to the sighting my mom tried to make a phone call when she made the call she got heavy interference on the phone...   Not sure if that helps any thought that was just an odd thing;47.6621;-122.6981
