Driving to 7/11 in Silverdale, I witnessed a circle of rotating lights that consisted of red, blue, and white flashing at a steady pace.  After I went in and made my purchase, I entered my vehicle to look back in the same direction and I sad a glowing orange circle in the same location I had seen the previous lights.  As I began to drive and sat at the light the object begin to move.  When I reached my residence I called my wife to see the orange object which was still there and she saw it but right before our eyes it turned a bright white brighter than all the stars.;47.6621;-122.6981
