Bright light west of Harrington hwy.;2019-11-01 20:15:00;2 minutes;Bright light west of Harrington hwy. Returning home to Harrington from Spokane passed milepost 122 and noticed a bright light to the west.  Thought it could be a planet because it was so bright but was too close for a planet.  Stayed in the same spot and then suddenly it was gone.  We looked around and it was nowhere to be seen.;47.4564;-118.2729
