Two adult males witness a large, fast-moving diamond-shaped craft in the morning sky.;2005-06-15 11:30:00;3 minutes;Two adult males witness a large, fast-moving diamond-shaped craft in the morning sky. I am writing to report the sighting of a UFO in Lincoln County, Washington, U.S.A. In the middle of June 2005, I forget the exact date, my father and I were driving home from a fishing trip at approx. 11:30 a.m. heading east on Coffeepot Rd., 5 miles west of Harrington, Washington. We had just crested a hill when off to the right in the sky to the southwest a flash like the reflection of the sun off a mirror caught my eye. I turned in my seat and saw an object moving from the southwest to the northeast, at slow speed. From my vantage point it appeared to be at about a 40 degree angle from the horizon. As it moved across the sky it passed over the highway in front of us. Its profile I can only describe as flat, like a pane of glass. As it passed by it rolled toward us and revealed its shape, which appeared as that of a diamond. It then rolled to its former profile, paused, then darted away. I saw something similar a week later, but havenâ€™t since. ((NUFORC Note:  The two witnesses in this case are well known to our Center, and we consider them both to be unusuall capable observers, and exceptionally reliable.  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));47.4564;-118.2729
