My roommate and I were sitting on the porch and saw two objects flying high in the western sky.  We noticed them because they were flying in perfect formation and at high altitude which is odd for aircraft.  We both watched with amazement, and after 5 seconds I started to doubt they were anything out of the ordinary until they both turned simultaneously toward outer-space and vanished.  I am still stunned at what I saw since we watch the planes and flight patterns on a nightly basis.  Just after all of this happened, I went to my room and a very loud (perhaps military) helicopter flew over my house and toward the UFO location, which was unusual as well.;47.6082561403509;-122.039670175439
