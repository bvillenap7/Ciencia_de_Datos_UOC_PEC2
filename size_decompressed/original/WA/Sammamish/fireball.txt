Bright ball of light falling from the ski in Sammamish looking East towards the mountians.;2005-01-04 18:30:00;2 seconds;Bright ball of light falling from the ski in Sammamish looking East towards the mountians. Me and my friend were driving home and going up a hill from E. Lake Sammamish up on NE 43rd Way towards the Sammamish Plateau.  Just as we crested the top of the hill we both sighted an object falling straight down from the dark stary ski.  This object was a huge ball of light with a green tint.  It was falling at a very fast rate straight down.  First thought it was a shooting star or meteor but it was to big, bright and falling straight down really fast.  It was hard to tell the exact location but definitely towards the East, but the distance from our location was hard to differentiate.  After it fell it was to low to tell what had happened it went behind the tree line.  I would expect am impact crator or explosion on impact from the size and rate it was falling.;47.6082561403509;-122.039670175439
