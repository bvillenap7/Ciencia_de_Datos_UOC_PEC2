The object was bright red.;2002-11-05 19:50:00;1 min. 15 sec.;The object was bright red. On November 15th at 7:50 p.m. we observed a bright red light to the east at 55 degrees and watched it for 45 degrees.  I would estimate the duration as being approximately a minute and a half.  As I watched through my binoculars, I saw a white light stream out in front of it that was about twelve times the lentgh of the red light.  Then it suddenly disappeared. It did not have any other colored lights and did not flash.  It moved at a steady pace and made no sound.  The light and the color did not vary at all as it passed.  It was much brighter red than the port light of a jet and was much brighter than any light I have ever seen from an aircraft.;47.6082561403509;-122.039670175439

The object was over the trees above the neighbor's house, about .3 of a mile away. It made no noises and almost didn't move, however it did change colors constantly. The colors were twinkling and were changing randomly. The object was much bigger than any of the stars present in the sky, and it twinkled much more than the stars.;47.6082561403509;-122.039670175439
