I live in an upper middle class neighborhood in the suburbs and am 43 years old, Caucasian.  I volunteer at the my daughterâ€™s school and co-lead her 2nd grade brownie troop.   I was walking down the street and heard a small plane.  I looked up and saw a bi-plane flying in circles. I noticed about a dozen or more small white objects floating in the sky either near or above the plane. They were somewhat round, although it was hard to be sure.  They were somewhat reflective either white or silver and glinted as if they were moving yet stayed stationary for the most part.   One of them seemed larger, possibly because it was nearer and had a sort of  parachute shape.  Some ladies saw me taking pictures and we all started looking at the objects trying to figure out what they were.   At first we thought they might be parachutes, but they were hovering in the same position for too long. We also guessed they might be balloons.   After about a minute or so of staying in a fairly stable pattern, they started to spread out and change positions.  They looked like star constellations.  In fact, one group was forming what looked like the big dipper.   As we stood watching, they began to  dissipate into the atmosphere as if they were floating upward and then they disappeared.;47.6082561403509;-122.039670175439
