bright orange light in a line in washington;2010-08-27 20:00:00;1 min;bright orange light in a line in washington I was outside putting away my goats.  When I was done I was laying on the ground watching the clouds.  Then I looked the opposite direction I saw this smallish orange line in the sky.  It was moving at a pretty slow speed.  As it moved further away it got smaller and kind of turned into this smallish circle thing.  Afterwards i heard a couple airplanes and a helicopter.
