Bright orange light.;2002-08-28 01:30:00;10-12 seconds;Bright orange light. I woke up about 1:30 A.M. and observed what I thought was an aircraft moving to the north. I went to open the window for a better view. The object had a bright orange light in back and 3 or 4 small orange lights where the wings would be. Using the spacing of the small lights where the wings would be, it was either very large or low flying. I observed the object for 10-12 seconds. No sound could be heard. There were no flashing anti collision lights that you would normally see on an an airplane at night. I have never seen an airplane at night with all orange lights. Did anyone else report anything like this?;46.1406;-122.8856
Bright single point of light;2005-03-10 17:55:00;5min;Bright single point of light My sister inlaw and I were outside on the front porch and the weather was clear and warm.  I was looking at the stars that were just starting to show because it wasnt totally dark yet.   As we were chatting I noticed a bright object come into view overhead travelling from west to east just slightly north of the constellation Orion.The object was at least mag 8 in brightness.At first I thought it was a plane then as we watched I noticed no running lights or flashing beacons that a airliner would normally use. As the object passed over head it maintained its brightness as it traveled to the east which ruled out navigation lights.So I figured it must have been the ISS 9International Space Station)passing overhead 200 miles up.However I checked for local viewing times to see what time the station was to be viewed but it wasnt to appear for another hour after the time we viewed this very bright object.So its a mystery to me as to what this was. ((NUFORC Note:  If the time of the time of the sighting, indicated by the witness, is correct, the object could not have been the ISS, the orbital schedule of which appears below: 09 Mar -0.5 19:58:01 10 WSW 20:00:51 71 WNW 20:00:51 71 WNW  10 Mar -0.4 18:51:06 10 SW  18:54:03 48 SE  18:56:50 11 ENE  10 Mar 1.4 20:26:42 10 W  20:28:34 28 WNW 20:28:34 28 WNW  11 Mar -0.5 19:19:22 10 WSW 19:22:27 64 NNW 19:24:25 19 NE;46.1406;-122.8856

We went down to go follow it, but it kept moving further away and when we walked back it followed us back home.;46.1406;-122.8856
Lights forming a unknown shape with four beams;2008-08-09 10:00:00;Current;Lights forming a unknown shape with four beams The lights were forming a unknown figure. We have followed the light to see what it was but when we kept following it, it just kept moving. Also when we were going back home it followed us, but at first we thought it was just light until it started following us all the way home. It has been here all night it seems like it wants something. It is hard to see though because the clouds are moving from our sight making it hard to see it.;46.1406;-122.8856

Bright Red & Orange light travelling north over Columbia River in SW Washington;2013-03-28 08:30:00;7-10 minutes;Bright Red & Orange light travelling north over Columbia River in SW Washington Sitting at the dining table, looking through windows directly south toward the Columbia River and the Oregon hills, I saw a large, very solid red light, surrounded by a distinct orange, partial surrounding (missing the orange at the bottom), moving at a fair clip in a trajectory roughly following the I-5 freeway.  Assuming this was a helicopter, I started watching more closely, wondering why a helicopter was coming so close to us, as we sit up on a hill, with a broad view.  The craft slowed and came to a stop, somewhere above the freeway, as it appeared to me.  It didn't turn, the lights didn't flash, it just stopped, for approximately 4 or 5 seconds, then moved to the north east, closer to us, then stopped again.  At this point, we scrambled to get up and go outside, cameras, etc.  It took us several seconds to do that.  We got out side and watched this light.  There was no sound, although if it had been a plane or helicopter of that size and location, we w! ould normally hear it.   It was large, appearing much larger than stars normally appear.  There was a light cloud cover beginning to move in, and ultimately, the stopped craft seemed to disappear behind the clouds as they closed in on it.  The clouds seemed rather opaque as they covered it, although it otherwise appeared to be very light cloud cover, that I would have assumed that you could have perhaps seen such a bright light through.  Interestingly, the camera would not focus in on whatever the object was, which was unusual, I frequently take pictures of the moon, bright stars, planes, etc.;46.1406;-122.8856
Red light slows down and strived white before it instantly began traveling back in the direction it came from.;2018-02-08 18:30:00;10 minutes;Red light slows down and strived white before it instantly began traveling back in the direction it came from. My husband and our friend and I were just smoking a cig outside, when our friend pointed out a red lifht in the sky and said “watch that light, it’s doing weird things.”  So all three of us watched as it continued kind of like a plane, but faster when it slowed down to stop and hovered for approximately 5 seconds then started traveling the opposite way.  Then it stopped again and just disappeared.  We were all yelling “whoa! It disappeared” and just then it reappeared and did the same thing again but this time it flashed white 2 or 3 times before it took off the other direction again.   We watched it until it disappeared again.  Waited for 5 minutes for it to reappear again but we are on the clock and had to get back to work. When it came to a stop it almost looked as though it bounced..like a ball in semi slow motion when you throw it against a wall.  My iPhone couldn’t see it to get a video.;46.1406;-122.8856
