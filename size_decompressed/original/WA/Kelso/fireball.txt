Three fireballs seen accross Kelso, WA.;2006-03-19 23:30:00;about 10 seconds;Three fireballs seen accross Kelso, WA. 3/19 11:30pm My husband first saw the object and called me out, him and one other saw the most, I caught the end. We saw an orange ball w/flames around it. It looked about 10 times bigger than a normal star would in the sky. It looked low in the atmosphere, could see the glow, like a comment coming through. It also had a blue like tail behind it. It traveld downwards and over like an arch. About 3 minutes later, one of the wittness then saw another similar object falling directly down, except it was smaller in size. This object vanished out of view after only a couple seconds.  3/20 12:15 am Husband was in the Safeway parking lot and saw a smiliar object as earlier. No tail was noticed. This fireball was about two times bigger than the first, but seemed further away. it traveled very quickly (unreal speed) across the sky, lasting only a few seconds, just enough time to notice it, then it disapeared.;46.1406;-122.8856
Saw a fireball flyover Longview WA from Kelso WA.;2014-01-26 17:15:00;2-3 minutes;Saw a fireball flyover Longview WA from Kelso WA. At about 1715 hours,  Me and a friend witnessed a streetlight colored fireball slowly flying from South to North over Longview WA, viewed from Kelso WA.  It continued on course until it faded under an observable star to the north, which star I have no idea, but it slowly faded away.  At the time we witnessed one plane to the south east, however it was too far away to of produced any flares, and it was on a descent course to Kelso Longview Regional Airport.;46.1406;-122.8856
Orange fireball with a tail traveling at fast speed in Kelso WA, changed direction abruptly, came by 3x this week;2015-07-15 00:00:00;1 minute;Orange fireball with a tail traveling at fast speed in Kelso, WA, changed direction abruptly, came by 3x this week 12:30-1:30am, July 15th. Standing on the front porch looking towards the South I saw an orange ball a quarter the size of the moon coming towards me like a bomb, very orange like a fire ball with a tail.  It was moving at an extremely fast speed, faster than a helicopter, I donâ€™t know how much faster than that it was.  It was very high up in the sky and hard to determine speed without anything near it to compare it to, because it was so high up. It did not look man made. It was coming towards me at a fast pace and then it did a very fast turned to the East.  It faded in brightness and dimmed to invisibility.  I watched it for about a minute.;46.1406;-122.8856
