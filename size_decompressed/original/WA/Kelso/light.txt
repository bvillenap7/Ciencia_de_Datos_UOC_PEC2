A bright white flash of light and a red then white light that vanished.;2009-02-11 22:30:00;20 sec;A bright white flash of light and a red then white light that vanished. Around 10:30pm, there was a large flash of white light, resembling a lightning flash.  My cousin and I were standing outside.  I was waiting to hear thunder and my cousin looked up a saw a distant red light that turned white and then it vanished.  He told me to look but I missed it.  He pointed out where he saw the light.  It was between the star Bellatrix, the west shoulder (on Orion), and the star (his hand) on the shield.  We realized that the flash couldn't have been lightning since there were no clouds in the sky nd no thunder was heard. It was a very bright but brief flash of white light from above.;46.1406;-122.8856

It was moving slowly south to north along I-5, was really bright, didn't have any red or green marker lights, and didn't make any sound.   I took a pic. and some video, but wasn't good enough to show any shape.
