Orange object approximate 2 minute sighting.;2011-07-04 22:15:00;2 minutes;Orange object approximate 2 minute sighting. On the evening of July 4th, my son and I were in the backyard, as he was letting off some fireworks.  I was sitting in a chair facing north a few feet from where he was at.  I was watching the fireworks that he let off, as well as some others in the neighborhood.  I was looking east up in the sky.  I saw a small light, thinking it was the remains of someone's fireworks.   As I kept watching, it moved and got bigger.  It was heading SW in the sky and was orange in color.  It appeared to be oval shaped but looked like there was a smaller area on the top also orange.  The light was solid and did not blink.  Due to all the fireworks around us, it was noisy, but in moments of silence I could not hear any noise coming from the object.  I kept watching until my view was obstructed by a tree, that was close by.  I jumped up to see if I could still see, it but it was gone.  It either disappeared, or went behind the tree where I could not see it any more.  My son saw it also, but was intent on his fireworks, so did not pay much attention.;46.1406;-122.8856

Looking at the stars I noticed what looked like a satellite moving across the dark sky, when it began to fade out.  Thinking it was going in to the earths shadow I looked away and noticed a shadow moving across the sky. The object is hard to describe. Imagine a brick with rounded edges and protrusions sticking out on both ends.  It was a little darker than the sky. It glided over the top of the building and disappeared.  If you followed the angle back to where I saw the light dim out, it matched. I told my co workers what I had seen and was thinking about reporting this, but decided not to.  Two days later which was today, a co worker told me about a radio program she was listening to that described an object, like the one that I had seen.;46.1406;-122.8856

Object had dim light running through center.  Looked like Blimp, but didn't have any noise from engines.  It was traveling North at higher speed than any Blimp I've seen.;46.1406;-122.8856
