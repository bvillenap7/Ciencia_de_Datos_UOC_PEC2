UFO's watch Kelso, Washington, fireworks.;2014-07-04 23:00:00;30 minutes;UFO's watch Kelso, Washington fireworks We were on our front porch watching fireworks in the city looking south.  We noticed two airplanes in the distance flying in formation, we thought they were watching the fireworks.   Then we noticed they didn't fly like planes and they were glowing orange instead of red/green.   About then there were three more coming out of the southwest.  The first two gained altitude and headed south and disappeared in the overcast.  We noticed them at about 600 to 1000 ft altitude they appeared to our best estimate 50 to 60ft in diameter.  My estimate of distance was about a mile to 2 miles out from the house.  We got out binoculars and a camera.  The video is pathetic but, captured.  We had one then come out of the west towards the house at about 500ft up.  I then took the binoculars and got a pretty good view of the saucer shape with an orange light of varying brightness on one side rotating on the axis of it.   After it joined up with the others to the south and disappea! red, either two came back or two more showed up at the south end of town.   The lights dimmed and disappeared.  Two strangers from the neighborhood walked by stated they had seen them also.;46.1406;-122.8856
