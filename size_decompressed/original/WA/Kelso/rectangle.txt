What I could see was it looked like a glowing read and orange lantern, turned sideways and that's the best that I can describe it and I kept saying what is that? There was no sound I felt like it knew I was watching it and when it got close to going over the house I ran to grab my cell phone to take a picture and ran out the back door figuring as slow as it was moving Id get a good picture. When I looked up it had turn at a 90 degree angle and was shooting straight up! I took several pictures but it was small by then, but I di get a picture of a perfect donut shaped exhaust it left. After this my son called and wan! ted me to pick him up from a place he was watching the firework display in Longview Wa and when I did and was telling him about my experience we saw another one with the same glowing, red lantern look and it was just hovering there like it was hanging in a tree, I told my son to hurry and take a picture with his phone and by the time he got it out and took a picture, it did the same thing and flattened out to like a cigar shape but he got that picture too as it was small at that time though.;46.1406;-122.8856
