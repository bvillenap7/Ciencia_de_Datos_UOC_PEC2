At first I thought it was an airplane but as I got closer I realized it was not.  It was silver in color and disk shaped.  It was huge, about the size of a football field and had white, red and green lights around the bottom edge.   There was another bright spotlight emitting from the center, shining down on the trees in the forrest.  As I drove past it, I realized the craft was not moving.  It was just hovering above the trees and made no sound at all.  I passed it (too afraid to stop) and looked back at it.  It was gone.  I couldn't see it anywhere.  Not in any of my rearview mirrors or when I turned my head to look.;47.4949;-117.5789
