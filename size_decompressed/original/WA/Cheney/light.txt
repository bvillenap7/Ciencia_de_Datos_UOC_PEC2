We then noticed that there was way more than just one, we observed approximately 20-30 of these lights traveling in a perfectly spaced distance from each other and going northeast.  This lasted for 3-4 minutes.  It ended by the last light traveling across and disappearing like the rest.;47.4949;-117.5789
