(don't know what it was but it was'nt a plane) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Probably a celestial body, we suspect.

White light that seemed to slowly fade as if it were slowing burning out.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Intl. Space Station.  PD));2012-04-12 21:20:00;4 minutes;The light appeared at first to look like an airplane light but there were no flashing lights and it was lower than the planes usually fly over this area.  It was moving east at a slower speed than most planes as well.  The odd part was it was a white light that seemed to slowly fade as if it were slowing burning out, like a flashlight when the battery is starting to die, it lit back up and then quickly went out.  No tail was visible. We are working professionals reporting this to see if anyone else saw the same thing. The night sky was clear and stars were visible.
