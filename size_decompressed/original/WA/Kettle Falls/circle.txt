Super bright ufo, northeastern Washington.;2017-06-20 02:30:00;5 minutes;Super bright ufo, northeastern Washington. At aproximately 02:30 am my son and i were out at night stargazing when we saw 2 circular illuminated glowing orbs moving across the sky.  The two objects seem to light up brighter and then dim down.  They were moving at a high rate of speed, possibly 2000 miles per hour!!  Then they just blinked out/gone.
