It was large and moving fast my daughter said it was moving toward us.  We couldn’t hear any sound we kept asking each other what the heck this thing was. When it got right in front of us it just disappeared in a blink of an eye.  It was so weird we watched to see if it would reappear but it didn’t, it was if it knew we were watching.  We stayed out looking and watching for about half an hour and only saw a few more meteors and a couple of satellites.;48.6364;-118.0548
