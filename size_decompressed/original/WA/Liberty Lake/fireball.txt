5 second big flaming ball in the night sky at an outdoor movie.;2012-08-25 22:00:00;5 seconds;5 sec big flaming ball in the night sky at an outdoor movie. We were at an outdoor movie when all of a sudden across the sky was a reddish, yellow, orange color. It looked like a fireball object that just disappeared on the other side of the sky.   It started on the north side of the sky and ended on the south.  It looked sort of like a shooting star but the color change is different and the size is much larger.   The object was very large and bright with bursting fire colors, it was going very fast and looked like a flaming space craft, but oddly shaped.   I didn't know what it was, I started wondering if it was a sign from other unknowing life on different planets or galaxies.  I want to know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date.
