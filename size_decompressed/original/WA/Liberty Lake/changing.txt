I also noticed other much smaller lights occasionally shooting off the light or flashing around it. This starlike light also appeared to randomly shift at times.  Usually very small but erratic movements.  The light also appeared to be pulsating erratically.  My wife and I watched for almost an hour.  It slowly shifted north on the horizon over the course of an hour.  The part that has me convinced it is not a typical star is the size and intensity of the bright light and the strange light phenomenon shooting off and around this bright orb.;47.6517;-117.0838
