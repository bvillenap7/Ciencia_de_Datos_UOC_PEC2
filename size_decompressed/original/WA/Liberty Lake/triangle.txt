Triangle shaped lights, white w/orange rim, moving in unison across night sky;2003-07-09 22:12:00;3 minutes;Triangle shaped lights, white w/orange rim, moving in unison across night sky Sitting outside looking into the sky, came across moving lights. The lights took the shape of a triangle and moved from west to the east directly above me. No sound was heard. The lights were extremely high in the air. At first looked like a satellite until I notice the other two light forming the triangle. The light held the triangle shape and moved in unison. The lights were white with an orange outer rim in color. They did not blink, just moved silently across the sky. Too high for airplanes, moved a little slower than a fast moving satellite. I was able to follow it from directly above me, across the sky, until it disappeared in the horizon.;47.6517;-117.0838

It cruised by a little before midnight.  Around 200 ft up  Moved slow and silent.   It had 3 bright lights making a triangle, underneath of it was light up with dimmer lights.  Reasonable guess military drone.   Before the incident I saw a few normal drones and jets.  More jets arrived afterwards.;47.6517;-117.0838
