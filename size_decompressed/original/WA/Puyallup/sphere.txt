2 possible crafts seen over Puyallup,WA;2004-06-17 11:30:00;20 minutes;2 possible crafts seen over Puyallup,WA both of the craft seemed to be white, and round, and very high up.  A Southwest airplane flew by while we were watching the crafts and the Crafts seemed to be alot higher then the commercial airliner.  It was a very creepy thing to watch.  The crafs were just staying in one spot, not moving at all, jus holding thier spot.  they kept almost exactly the same distance away from eachother the whole time .  We watched them untill they seemed to disapear into thin air.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
orange glowing object that drops smaller glowing ojects.;2004-12-12 02:45:00;5 Minutes;orange glowing object that drops smaller glowing ojects. I saw a orange object roughly East of my location at about 35 degrees from the horizon.  I watched as it travelled in a West/Southwest direction.  It moved slower than an aircraft, but faster than a blimp.  It did not have any flashing strobes that I can see.    I live in the flight path of nearby McChord AFB and have seen hundreds of aircraft follow this route.  This object appeared to be slightly higher than those aircraft approaching McChord AFB, and much lower than commercial aircraft for nearby Seatac International.  As the object moved by and was now to my South, I saw as it dropped several, 3-4, small objects that glowed and seemed to go out as they neared the ground.  I can only describe them as burning ember like, only they fell instead of rose.  The object continued West and made small, slow direction changes, at one point turning back east before going West again.  The object dropped a few more embers before it lost whatever illumination it had and disappeared.  I could hear a faint noise that I compare to mabye a blimp enjine, too quiet for a helicoptor.  I could hear the noise after the object was no longer visible.  The ojbect did not move over the horizon, but simply stopped illuminating.  I would guess this object was no more than a mile or two from my location and only a few thousand feet of altitude.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
September 1, 2007 clear morning sighting of three or four UFOs floating in the skies of Puyallup Wa - four witnesses on the scene;2007-09-01 11:00:00;several minutes;September 1, 2007 clear morning sighting of three or four UFOs floating in the skies of Puyallup Wa - four witnesses on the scene On the morning of September 1, 2007 at about 11:00am my girlfriend and I were sitting in her backyard playing a dice game and drinking coffee.  She escaped to a back room to do something so I was sitting alone. I looked through two standing trees in her yard and saw two silverish colored, clear balloon type objects in the distance - circular I suppose - in the clear sky.  I figured they must've been helium balloons that were escaping into the sky as they were moving as balloons at first. I continued to watch and yelled for my girlfriend to come from a back room - she then came and witnessed the UFOs with me.  After a few minutes of watching we were not able to identify them as balloons - they rose higher and continued to float at what I believe to be - thousands of feet - in the air - slowly - not exactly erratically, but not as though being propelled by the wind either. I became excited when I saw two neighbors outside in the front where I had moved after the ufo's floated over the treetops from the backyard to the front.  I saw THREE very clear unmistakable shapes - lights or light reflecting - as the sun from a balloon shape.  But as my neighbors and I gazed straight up overhead at the object - there were two others close to this object - same size and dimensions - we could not say if it were a weather balloon or not - it did not seem to move as a weather balloon might - although I don't know what a weather balloon looks like in the air. I feel this is a significant sighting as there were witnesses and we all saw the same thing for several minutes before the objects just continued to float out of sight.  They did not zip off into the sky. I don't know what I saw.  I would like answers as to how this lit object could appear so large in the sky - I have seen balloons before as I live near a place that has helium balloons escape all the time from it's premises (auto dealership) - and I have watched these balloons travel high into the sky before they just disappear. The objects we four witnessed were not balloons such as these - transluscent balloon shaped - well - lit objects. I felt they were intelligently manned but that is just a guess. Please advise.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131

A high flying and very slow and still ufo was soon followed by two f-16s.;2013-07-06 16:30:00;10 minutes;A high flying and very slow and still ufo was soon followed by two f-16s. UFO was seen higher than planes normally fly over our area.  It moved slowly across the sky.   Then shortly after fell out of sight, it, or one like it, then returned again at a significantly lower elevation and remained seemingly still.   After a couple minutes, I turned to speak to my wife and when I looked back up it was gone.   15 minutes later 2 F-16s flew over us northbound.

After like a minute it would shoot some sort of flares straight down.  For sure it didn't look like a plane.
