On a quiet warm summer night I pulled up to my parent's house where I still lived while finishing my second college year. Across the street there was a high school football field with an old wood grandstand on the opposite side that faces the field and across to our house. Getting out of the car I heard an intermittent buzzing sound which seemed to come from the field. I thought it might be new sprinklers but the sound was odd so my curiosity was aroused. As I attempted to focus on the sound it shifted from the left to the center of the field and it also echoed off the grandstand. Audibly I realized it was off the ground. I looked up attempting to identify the source of the sound and I saw an object with multicolored lights that were flickering in a sort of rotating pattern.It appeared to have followed my car and was maneuvering in a tightening circle thus shortening its trajectory directly at me, and it was descending. I was awestruck long enough to observe subtle lights of green, red, blue and white on the bottom of the object. I have piloted a plane, boated, and I understand navigation lights well and these were not regular navigation lights. My hair stood on end as I was aware that I was likely witnessing a greatly advanced mechanical object. Suddenly, in sheer animal panic, I ran to the back porch of the house. I was really shaking as I fumbled with the key to unlock the door and the buzzing got louder indicating that it was getting closer yet. I rushed in and yelled at my parents who had been in bed a little while. They came out to the kitchen by the porch but the sound dissipated and they didn't hear it. Reflecting back, the object seemed rather small, perhaps smaller than my car. I am a sane and logical person and I truly believe what I experienced was not of this world, or at least anything mankind has created. I have told very few people this and this is the first time I have reported it in this way. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

red ball streaks across the sky;2000-07-04 22:15:00;8-10 minutes;red ball streaks across the sky We were watching the fireworks on our back patio (looking west) and below and to the right of the moon I saw a bright red light.  It stayed in place and slow moved up/easterly?  I was pulsing 3-5 times then would stop.  It hooked slightly above the moon and still to the right.  Then it suddenly changed course and headed westerly at a high rate of speed pulsating furiously until it was out of site.  There was cloud cover so it had to be below the ceiling.  It seemed to disappear into the clouds so I am guessing that it was gaining altitude as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this time and date.  PD));47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
Orange object with other faster objects breaking away from it ...;2001-06-11 22:40:00;3 minutes;Orange object with other faster objects breaking away from it ... My 15 year old son and I (His mother age 40) were coming home from the store at approx. 10:30pm.  He was watching something out the back window and I assumed it was a plane since he is taking flight lessons and likes to watch them.  We got out of the car when arriving home and he said Mom, that isnt a plane.  I looked up and said what is it?  He said I dont know...  I saw an Orange colored round object above us that was moving slowly Southwest.  It had some type of an extension that seemed to circle the whole object continuousley as it moved... then it stopped and as it started again it headed more in a western direction then a bright orange object shot off of it very fast and went south and was gone.. then as it moved another bright very small object shot off of it only it went in the same direction as the main object then this happened several more times and then it all dissapeared. My son and I were just awestruck since I always thought that people were nuts when they spoke of UFO'S but we saw something strange with our own eyes... and now I believe it.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131

I looked at my 79 year old father in law and asked, How's your eyes?  He said fine. I said look at the Moon. He said what  the?  We looked at each other.  When we looked back it was gone.  I was pretty excited.  Him not so much.  Clearly something was up there.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
A large, dark, disk-shaped object plowed through clouds, was observed by couple in hot tub.;2017-10-10 21:15:00;10 seconds;A large, dark, disk-shaped object plowed through clouds, was observed by couple in hot tub. Spouse and I went into our hot tub around 21:00.  It was a pretty clear night with wispy clouds and fairly dark since the moon hadn’t begun to rise.  There were a lot of stars, so we were just chatting and enjoying the view.   Around 21:15, I saw a dark disk-shaped object fly north about 80 degrees from where we were sitting.  I shouted, “Look at that, look at that!” to my spouse, which he immediately did, and witnessed the same thing.  There were no lights, but you could see the shape of it as it passed, causing a bow wave as it passed through some wispy clouds.   I noticed a shadow on it that was in the shape of a “L”.  It also made no sound.   We’re used to planes going by with their flashing lights and noise, but this was eerily quiet.  We couldn’t tell how high it was, but relatively speaking, it appeared to be large.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
