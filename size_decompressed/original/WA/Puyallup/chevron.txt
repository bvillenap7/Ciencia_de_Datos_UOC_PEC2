February 20th, 2008 sighting during Lunar Eclipse in Puyallup, WA. 98375.  McCord Air Force base and Fort Lewis Army base are very near by.  Thun Field, a small plane airport, is within 2 miles. While typing an e-mail, I heard the 11 o'clock P.M. weather man remind us to go look at the stunning lunar eclipse.  I went out to the back porch to gaze at the moon, which was about half shadowed in its eclipse.  The night was clear and the moon was over the North/East section of my house.   I grabbed the binoculars off the workbench to get a better view.  As I raised them to my eyes and focused on the moon, I saw a shadow cross my view.  I pulled them away from my eyes thinking an owl must have flown by, since I heard no sound of a plane.  Nothing seen.  I put the binoculars back to my eyes and floating in front of the moon was a giant V shaped object.  Not as sharp as a V but not as curved as a boomerang.  It was slowly moving, more like floating toward the small Thun airfield to the north.  It was barely above the 75 foot evergreen trees on the west and north sides of my 1/4 acre and was directly over my house and barely moving.  The thing was giant.  I would guess 3 football field lengths per wing.  No body, no windows, no vapor trail, no noise at all.  Just a giant V with the faintest of white night lights all along the top of the V, in a straight line.  It was almost see through and nearly invisible to the naked eye.  I had to scan back and forth to see the whole thing until it got farther away. Transfixed I just stood there and watched. Several times I pulled the binoculars away and could only barely see it. I thought about getting the flashlight and flashing it at it but stood there and watched it float away towards the north. I just found this website on 10/13/09 and saw the Feb. 20th, 2008, account of a sighting in Fayetteville, North Carolina about the same time.  Never knew there was a place to report to. I need to get better binoculars!;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
2 orange v shaped objects with orange lights.;2013-07-04 22:30:00;15 minutes;2 orange v shaped objects with orange lights On July 4th about 10:30 pm, I was watching the neighborhood backyard fireworks, and noticed two UFOs in the sky.  They were boomerang shaped, and had orange lights along the bottom, with a bigger orange light at the “v” .  The lights rotated up and down the bottom of the craft.  They moved around slowly and with no sound at all.  They would blink on and travel, then blink off for a few seconds and then blink back on in a different spot.  They were AWESOME!;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
