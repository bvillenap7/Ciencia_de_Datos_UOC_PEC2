High in the west sky I was looking at stars from my deck in Puyallup, Washington, and then appeared a white light about the size and width of the moon that moved quickly downward about the length of 8 moonwidths or maybe 12 degrees then it dissappeared. There were no clouds at all in the sky and it scared me into the house and I did not go back on my deck.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
EXTREMELY LARGE WHITE FLASH OF LIGHT, traveling towards the moon on 06/10-Puyallup, WA.;2014-06-10 00:00:00;a few seconds;EXTREMELY LARGE WHITE FLASH OF LIGHT, traveling towards the moon on 06/10-Puyallup, WA. It was around midnight when I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  I looked up and saw a bright white light following along the same general route as a previous craft I reported earlier was traveling.  Almost looked like a shooting star but wasnâ€™t quite as fast and the light trail lasted longer than most shooting stars I've ever seen.   The object disappeared into the clouds, headed towards the moon.  No noise.  Seemed closer to earth than the stars in the sky did.  This shooting white orb, in comparison, was about as size of an eraser on the end of a pencil, if held up to the sky with eyes squinted.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
