Blue and yellow lights hitting the window, but not shining inside.;1995-10-25 23:00:00;3 minutes;Blue and yellow lights hitting the window, but not shining inside. I was downstairs on the couch watching television.  I had all the lights off and the couch was against the window.  I was sitting sideways to the window so that it was on my right.  Then there was a blue and yellow light against the window.  I mean that the light was not coming in the the window, but just hitting the window.  The room was not lighting up at all with these colors.  There was no sound coming from outside.  The blue and yellow light would alternate about every 10 seconds.  This window was facing our backyard.  There is a 7 foot fence that blocks any car lights from the street.  I did get up as soon as the light stopped to check the backyard for anyone in the yard playing a trick, but there was nothing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Made my husband pull over off the freeway (by south hill mall) and we watched them move from east to west until they were hidden by trees.  They were not in a n organized pattern.  They looked to be high up in the sky.  Were small points of light.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
Nighttime UFO sighting in east Pierce County, wa;2005-01-31 22:45:00;seven minutes;Nighttime UFO sighting in east Pierce County, wa At the above time and date my roomate and I were on our roof having a cigarette when he said he saw fireworks in the sky to the southeast of our home. When I looked to see what he saw he told me that they were just underneath the plane he was pointing at. The object that he said was a plane was orange in color and was moving very slowly toward the north. It had no blinking lights but just a steady orange glow and seemed to be fairly high up and far away. As I was waiting to see fireworks in that vicinity I saw a light fall directly down from the object. It was smaller than the large light but the same color and was falling straight down for about seven or eight seconds and then would disappear. My first thought was that it could be an airplane breaking up, but the larger light continued to move slowly then eventually looked like it stopped from our viewpoint. As it was stopped we saw the same balls of light fall from it four more times, each one disappearing after about five to ten seconds. The larger object then began to move again due east and appeared to be climbing in altitude, and another light dropped from beneath it. This fell straight downward until it disappeared. We watched as the large orange light continued east and got smaller until it vanished about 50 degrees up in the horizon. We live in an area with lots of commercial and military air traffic and I have never seen anything like this.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131

extreme bright light;2006-10-16 18:40:00;1:00;extreme bright light I dont know what that was, but usually aircraft are seen moving. My wife noticed it first and she said she watched it for maybe a minute then asked me what the light was we were sitting on our couch and I leaned over and saw it for myself.  The light was very bright seemed pertty low and with in seconds of me seeing it it moved and the light went dim and it was gone.  It was just odd, it did not look anything like a helicopter or airplane, becasue the ligth was so bright then it just dimmed out and it was gone and it really did not look like it moved, but it did move when the light went dim, it is really hard to explain and i can say it was not normal.   I dont know maybe it was just a aircraft. It looked to be over McChord AFB, but I have seen aircraft land and take off from there and they never have looked like that before.  Also we did notice a aircraft in the same area we had seen the lights and we could clearly identify it as a airplane, this was a few minutes after seeing the light.

Blue/White object seen flying/stopping/flying above Puyallup, WA, flying Northbound above the clouds.;2012-05-24 21:45:00;15 seconds;Blue/White object seen flying/stopping/flying above Puyallup, WA, flying Northbound above the clouds. My wife and I were sitting outside our house on the deck.  We were just admiring the night sky and the lights reflections on the clouds (We just moved here from the midwest 1 month ago).  As we were cloud/star gazing, of course we noticed airplane after airplane because of our close proximity to SeaTac and the joint military base.   All of a sudden we see an object that resembles a star, but is moving!  It stopped abruptly and then moved again.  The object was above the clouds as it disappeared and reappeared.  It had a blueish/whitish glow to it, but nothing extraordinarily bright.  I have never seen anything like it in my life.   I have spent many years active duty in the military and I am a mental healthcare provider for the government, so for all purposes considered, I have been around a lot of aircraft in my time. My wife is a public school teacher.  This object had to have had some sort of piloting or external control, it could not of been a shooting star! because of the abrupt stop and go and acceleration.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131

Puyallup wa.;2014-06-08 02:00:00;10-15 minutes;Two orange balls of light, in slow orbit across sky in the early morning of Sun. June 8th 2014. Puyallup wa. I couldn’t sleep no matter how hard I tried, although I am a psychic medium and suffer from frequent sensitivity related insomnia, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched/spoken to in ways I have never felt/heard.   I went outside around 2 am with my boyfriend, who I forcefully woke up to come with me as I smoked a cigarette when I witnessed 2 Reddish orbs slowly orbiting through the night sky about 10 minutes apart, in parallel areas of the sky.  No noise.  They weren’t like satellites or like shooting stars…I stared at them until they disappeared behind the clouds surrounding the moon.   They weren’t much larger in size than the normal bright white stars' they were moving around, stayed in one line of orbit-didn’t bounce around or make any turns.  No blinking, no light trail, no shift in apparent size.  When I say they were moving extremely slow I mean I watched each one go by for over 2 minutes each.   They both closely resembled mars in shape and color.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
3-6 lights seen over Puyallup Washington, then vanished.;2015-05-10 22:30:00;1-2 minutes;3-6 lights seen over Puyallup Washington, then vanished. My husband and I were visiting my mother in Puyallup, Washington, and had returned to our hotel, The Hampton Inn, to go to bed, as we were leaving the next morning.  It was around 10:30 p.m., maybe a little later, and I was lying in the bed farthest from the window.  I noticed in the sky, 3-6 lights in the sky.  At first I thought maybe it was a reflection, but even after moving around, the lights remained.  I told my husband and he confirmed what I was seeing.  His initial/instant reaction was to say that they were planes.  I told him that did not make sense because planes do not fly that close together and remain in one place.  He agreed and suggested helicopters.  But, then we both said that did not make sense either.   Before we could think much about it, all but one of the lights were just instantly gone.  My husband and I both looked at each other shocked and then the last light was gone.  We didn’t see any of them move, they were just gone.  We tried looking up sighting online but didn’t find anything.  I have looked a few times since to see if anything was reported, but I don’t really know where to look and the sites I was able to locate didn’t have that date listed.  So, I figured it might be good to report it in case others witnessed this also.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
Bright blue light in the southern sky of Puyallup, WA.;2015-06-10 23:30:00;30 seconds;Bright blue light in the southern sky of Puyallup, WA. I saw what looked like a meteor streak down across the southern sky.  It was extremely bright. A few seconds later I saw another, similar streak but this one seemed to burn out quickly and did not make it down to the horizon as the first one did. Then, I saw a bright blue light with a tiny glint of red light emerge slowly up from the horizon, traveling upward. At first I thought this might be fireworks or a drone but my window was open and the night was silent. The blue light appeared to be miles away and its altitude too high to be a hobby drone. The light continued slowly until it was out of view.  It was too bright to be an aircraft and it was absolutely silent.  I suppose it could be some phenomenon associated with a meteor shower, but I've never seen anything that bright moving slowly upward.   We do have McChord Air Force base nearby as well but this is the first time I've witnessed anything quite like what I saw.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131

The lights where real bright and at that altitude and the light intensity, it could not have been a quad-copter, or there something similar.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
Bright light shimmered and disappeared. ((anonymous report));2018-05-25 22:45:00;8 seconds;Bright light shimmered and dissappeared Bright light I’m the night sky.  Didn’t move or blink. After about 8 seconds it shimmered and disappeared.  No clouds around it. I was driving for work and noticed it.  I’m always looking up to try to catch something because I have been training in the field of remote viewing.  This is the first time seeing anything since a  sighting about 8 years ago.

Me and my wife were sitting on our back porch. I saw a bright light in the distance hovering over some trees.  After a few seconds it shot straight up and disappeared.  It was a clear night out as well, the whole thing was about 15 seconds.  Happened too fast to get pictures.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
