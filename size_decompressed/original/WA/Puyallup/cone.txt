Two balls of lighting zipping by in a fuselage formation over the field and then disappeared at low altitude;2012-02-08 22:00:00;2 seconds;Two balls of lighting zipping by in a fuselage formation over the field and then disappeared at low altitude Late in the evening around 10:00 PM, I was looking out my large kitchen window at the moon which was aglo and looked very eerie because it was so foggy that you could see the fog rolling under the motion light.   There was a very hazy sort of look and the moon was so bright it was beautiful.  I had glanced at the moon for just a second and I saw a very big, bright, and fast moving object in the eastern sky dart very quickly from South to North (right to left) at a 60 degree angle directly from the moon it could'nt have been far a way as it wall low flying and I could see it well.  It was shaped like the fuselage of an airplane with two bright orange glowing balls that were at the center but spaced together to make the shape of a cigar with a pointy nose.  It went so fast and was a soft dull glow, and then just disapeared in a matter of seconds.  It happended so fast but made such an impact on me that I will never forget it.  I thought, how could this be a met! ior when there were two seperate balls together forming a shape moving at an angle so fast that it reminded me of a jet airplane flying low at an air show.  Didn't look like one though it was very strange and the lights in the middle seemed to cast an outer ring around it that was a whitish green (I think this was a reflection off the fog)it literally gave me chills and would love some kind of explanation.
