I  was  driving  west  on  Meridian  and  looked  up  to  see  a  slowly  moving  red-orange  light  crossing  from  south  to  north  in  front  of  me.  It  was  slower  and  brighter  than  a left-wing  red  airplane  light.  I  pulled  over  and  got  the  binoculars  out  to  see  a  grouping  of five  red  ovals  looking  exactly  like  your  photo  from  Gilbert  Arizona (which  prompted  me  to  make  this  report).  Then, as  I  watched,  3  or  four  small  white  lights  dropped  out  of  the  bottom  of  the  thing  to  speed  off  laterally  and  disappear. Within  seconds,  it  then  faded  to  two  dim  white  ovals  and  then  blinked  out.  About  30  seconds  later  I  saw  one  of  the  white  lights  drop  vertically  to  the  horizon  at  meteoric  speed  at  what  appeared  to  be  at  least  five  miles  from  the  red  lights  from  which  it  may  have  come. I  am  a  former  member  of  MUFON  and  an  experienced  observer  of  aerial  phenomena.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131

It had to have been really big, but I blinked my eyes think iu by this can be real, but opened my eyes  it was still there then after about a min or so  it just disappeared.  I've seen the spacecraft with flashinglight hovering at night, but never during the day.  Hoping others saw it too!;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
