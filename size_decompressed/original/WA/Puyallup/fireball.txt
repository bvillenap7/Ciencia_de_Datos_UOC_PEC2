I saw a light shinning in the top right corner of my slider door it looked like a light that a search light from a helicopter would shine down.  I got up to see what it was and in the sky was a bright reddish orange object falling down out of the sky.  You could see smoke behind it. As it dropped it go significatly smaller to about the size of a dot and then went behind some trees and then all you could see was the smoke.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
Firey orb, moved slowly, silently, changed shape and emmitted strange glowing red balls, then disappeared.;2004-07-29 01:45:00;10 minutes;Firey orb, moved slowly, silently, changed shape and emmitted strange glowing red balls, then disappeared. Driving home from my friend's house on the early morning of July 29th, I saw a light in the sky. I thought that it might just be a planet that had come close to earth's orbit, since it was so big and colored kind of red like mars, but it was flickering. I slowed down to get a good look at it, but then I realized the object was moving! I really slowed down and pulled off to the side of the road where I sat and watched the object slowly float over me. I sat there trying to figure out what the object was exactly, as it really looked like someone lit a campfire and sent it into the air. The strange thing was that I could see something flapping in the wind on top of the fire. I really though that it might be a home-made hot air balloon(not one that anyone could travel in, more like the type where you get a large sack and light a fire under it and attach the fire in some sort of way. As the heat rises beneath the sack from the fire, the object begins to float and rises away), but the object was getting higher and higher and not running out of fuel. The object was about 1000 feet into the air when I first saw it. I got back in my car and drove home (less than 2 minutes away), but kept an eye on the object the whole way home. I pulled into my driveway and watched it. By this time, the object could have been 1500-2500 feet up. Here is the rather peculiar thing about the object though-- when it was extremely high, it sort of changed shape from being a firey orb to being a sort of elongated ember looking thing. You could tell the fire was dieing down because it changed from a yellow fire to looking like red burning embers, but very bright, but then it started shooting off red sparks/glowing balls. 2 of the glowing balls shot off even more smaller balls, and all of these glowing balls flew around rapidly. I ran into my house and upstairs to watch the object. By the time I made it upstairs, I looked at the main object and it was pulsing on and off. I ran back outside to see it again, and the object had disappeared.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
1 dark circular or oval shaped object, and  5+very bright fireball looking objects for 2 1/ 2hrs patrolling above and around my home;2012-07-04 21:44:00;almost 3 hours;1 dark circular or oval shaped object, and  5+very bright fireball looking objects for 2 1/ 2hrs patrolling above and around my home At around 9:30pm yesterday for the 4th of July myself, and the rest of my family were out in the front of our house lighting fireworks.  I had a camera in my hand to take some family photos.  I noticed what appeared to be a dark circular or oval shaped object moving from north to south above my home.  This object was not an airplane, did not emit any noise, and seemed to disappear as quickly as it came into sight. This happened just about the time when everyone was beginning their fireworks show. It was still somewhat daylight also.  I took as many photos as I could, my hands were so shaky after I saw this thing it was hard to stay stable.  I have witnessed objects before that I have never reported out of reluctance or fear to do so.  What was different this night is that more came as the night went on. Soon after the first one I noticed, I looked to the south of where I stood and I noticed a bright glowing object slowly moving in my direction.  Where I live I have! a ton of trees all around me so trying to photograph these things is difficult.  Behind and to the left of the first fireball looking object followed another one and another behind that one.  Then from behind the view of the trees one to the right of the first one appeared.  This is when I demanded attention from my 20 year old son who always blew me off as crazy, to witness this event with me.  I have to admit I was shaken up from this.  We continued to observe the objects and tried to take photos and videos.  They were moving across from right to left, left to right but I’d lose them because they would dim out or move out of view behind the trees.  Next thing I saw is a few of them coming from behind me again from north heading south (ish)  Because they’d dim out of view I couldn’t keep track of which one was doing what so I can’t tell you positively that there were any more in number than what I counted as being visible all at once which was 5.  There could have been more, or so! me of the five I saw that disappeared in my view could have be! en some of the same that came from behind me again.  It seemed as if they were on patrol. Moving over the area during the peak of the firework displays around the area I live in. They were all actively moving about as if floating and in no particular formation.  I saw one cross up and over in one direction while another one crossed its path in another direction while another one yet would come from out of nowhere on one of either side of me. I am a 40 yr. old mother of three children, currently attending college to get my AAS as a Paralegal.  I’ll be finished in December.  I was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol during this unforgettable experience.  But I sure needed a drink by the time I called it quits which was sometime between 11:45 (ish) and Midnight.  I have not yet gone through my pics to see if I captured anything good, but I’ll get them to you as soon as I am able to get to them.  Right now it’s 1:37am July 5th, and I’m still in shock, and stunned to say the least a! t what I witnessed tonight.  My son and I are willing to speak with anyone who’s interested.  Also I’ll be very surprised if no one else reports this.   Many people would have seen the same objects as my son and I. There’s no possible way they could not have.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
