Happen to turn to my right and facing upperward out of the side of my right eye I momentarly saw a black oblist triangular object hovering above me and it made no noise. We just moved into Puyallup: this was about 9 oclock at night in december. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
Oct 24, 2004 - slow moving triangle over Puyallup Washington.;2004-10-24 20:15:00;20 minutes;Oct 24, 2004 - slow moving triangle over Puyallup Washington. Walking outside, I looked up and saw a trianglge shapped object in the sky.  It was a long triangle shape with a light at the bottom. It was moving very slow and with no noise.  Bt the time I go to a camera, it was a little far away.  I used a digital camera . In the picture that was taken, in the middle is a small light.  when blown up, it looks like there are 2 lights, however when passing overhead, only one was visible.  It continued to move slowly for about 20-30 minutes until it just looked like a normal light in the sky.  I live next to an Air Force Base so it could have been a B@ bomber, however I cannot find any night pictures of one.  Many people in the apartments also saw it.  One suggested it could be a balloon, however it was on a steady course.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131

No sound traveling very slow Saw an object south.  Traveling slow turned and headed north and traveled directly over us. Was three white lights in triangle shape.   Had no sound, appeared to be very low 2-3,000 ft. Was the size of a 747 wing span.   Could not see any color just looked like the craft was invisible.   Traveled over us then turned west with a weird banking turn, not like a plane would turn.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
Very fast moving aircraft leaving contrails at right angles seen over Puyallup, WA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail against a blue sky.  PD));2015-01-20 15:33:00;~3 minutes;Very fast moving aircraft leaving contrails at right angles seen over Puyallup, WA. About 15:33 local time, saw an object far in the distance, ascending from the horizon at what appeared to be a very steep angle and leaving a smoke/vapor trail (reminded me of a rocket or missile launch).  Thought it looked a little unusual, until I observed it make a very sharp, practically right angle turn.  Looked to be travelling at a high rate of speed and not manoeuvering like a commercial aircraft. Object continued moving somewhat level until appearing to enter  another, more gentle turn while still climbing steeply (trail was more of an arc than another right angle).  Object was actually turning closer to me.  As it started to get closer, it became even more apparent that it was travelling extremely fast. The really curious part came as the aircraft travelled directly overhead.  It looked to be very high up, flying above the wispy cloud cover, and as it flew over, coincidentally, there was a commercial airliner passing underneath it.  Based on those observations, it looked to be too big to be a fighter.  As well, its shape (and coloring) did not really match any aircraft I am familiar with.  More flying wedge than plane with wings.  It looked more SpaceX than F-22 or F-35 (or any other active/inactive US military aircraft).  Most assuredly man made, but very unusual all the same. ((NUFORC Note:  Photos provided by witness, which appear to indicate contrails.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Hi, Here are a few images I took of the event in question.  I Wish now I had taken a video, but this is not the sort of thing I see every day and was wanting to watch it with my own eyes as much as possible. The blue area on the map picture shows the general line of sight where I was looking when first observing the craft (S/SE).  My vantage point is the dot at the apex of the traingular area. Again, I really wish I had recored a video, but would probably not have gotten anything usable as it passed overhead anyways due to the awkward angle of trying to blindly aim a camera almost straight up and out my window as it flew over.  I'm sure overall, this is a pretty pedestrain report (and not really alien), but some of he crafts movements didn't seem quite 'right', and it's shape was certainly unique. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Hey again, One thing I forgot to mention anywhere that is worth noting is the sound the craft made, which was none.  From the time I started watching it climb, until it came directly overhead, I didn't hear any sort of noise.  Also, I forgot to check the 'contact me' checkbox on the report.  If you need to contact me further with any other questions, feel free.   ((END ADDENDUM));47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
Triangular shape with single bright white light, no sound seen in the airspace south of Puyallup. Erratic flight characteristics.;2015-04-15 23:45:00;2-3 minutes;Triangular shape with single bright white light, no sound seen in the airspace south of Puyallup. Erratic flight characteristics. On April 15, 2015 11:45 P.M. 	I was working on building a new front porch on my home.  It was nearly midnight. I had to work late on my project because I had been exceptionally busy at work.  I was cleaning up my tools and debris and carrying them west towards my garage.  As I walked I glanced south and saw what I thought was the planet Jupiter.  I spend a time behind the telescope looking at Jupiter, Saturn, etc… and only because of that fact did I realize that something was out of place.  During that time of night and time of year, Jupiter has already passed the tree tops on the western edge of our property.  Realizing that something seemed out of place, I looked more closely at that the object that I had mistaken for a planet.  The size in the sky looked correct, also the brightness was comparable to Jupiter. 	At first the object seemed to be just hanging in place, I then wondered if I had mistaken it for another planet but then it started to move.  It kept a relative track of west to south east.  Suddenly, it made a very substantial, very abrupt turn due south, then another, equally sharp correction back to the east, then it began a sweeping arc back to the south. The movement seemed far too sharp for any aircraft that I have ever seen.   I ran in the house and grabbed my 8x binoculars that were sitting next to the door and returned to my front yard.  By the time I returned (roughly 15-20 seconds) the object had really picked up speed.  It was moving far faster than an aircraft.  I yelled for my wife but she didn’t hear me (as she was in the back of the house). 	I got the binoculars on it and could make out very little detail but this is what I saw. It appeared to be triangular in shape, it had one single, exceptionally bright white light that appeared to be centered in the object (it was so bright when viewed through the binoculars it did give the object a bit of an aura), and I couldn’t give a definitive size as I had nothing to compare it to, it had no landing lights, beacons, etc… just the one light and it made absolutely no sound.  The night was quiet, except for the frogs (which had gone quiet during the event, not necessarily because of the event, as they do that from time to time at night).  As the object began to move out of sight the white light seemed to take on an orange glow, like the moon seen through air pollution, then it just blipped out.  The whole event couldn’t have lasted more than 2-3 minutes.  The angle of my view must have dropped 15-25 degrees in elevation and 30 degrees from right to left as I tracked the object.  The night was completely clear, the temperature was 45-50 degrees.  It seemed very fast but, in fairness, not being able to judge the size or elevation of the object, I couldn’t say definitively, how fast it was actually traveling.  It seemed to move about as fast as a satellite, when you watch them pass over. 	The object would’ve had to cross over or very near the flight path of Joint Base Lewis/McCord. We lived in the base’s airspace for nearly 4 years now.  I have seen just about every type of aircraft come off that base, from Osprey, Chinook and Blackhawks to F-18’s, C-130’s etc…  I have never seen anything come off that base that resembled, in any way, what I saw that night.  The closest comparison that I could come up with was watching a satellite with the exception of possible size and flight characteristics. 	I did not report this to the authorities because I didn’t want people to think I was crazy. I know it sounds cliché but it’s the truth.  I have seen some strange things in my life but I’m sure they’ve all had logical explanations and this may very well have a simple, logical explanation but I couldn’t come up with one.  I found your site while searching the internet to see if anyone else might have reported something of this nature.  I did tell my wife, knowing that I am a very honest and pretty logical person, she believed that I did, indeed, see something but she still had to chuckle when I came in and told her about it.  It would be nice to know that I was not the only one to witness this phenomena. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
