Streak of green light with small head and long tail, like meteror;1998-09-23 22:49:00;2 seconds;Streak of green light with small head and long tail, like meteror Observed through windshield of my vehicle while heading north on Meridian towards Hwy. 512 It was bright green and appeared like a meteror streak, but seemed to be much closer, approximately 10-20 miles away. It appeared, from north-east to south-west and disappeared abruptly. I was listening to Art Bell at the time and had just heard about green fier balls and such appearing all around the country. At the exact moment that I heard the guest say that  it was important to try and get an exact time of sighting I saw the object in the sky through my windshield. I noted the time on my vehicles digital clock and have since compared it to other clocks. My vehicle clock is one minute slow, so the exact time of my sighting is 10:49 pm on Wednesday, 1998. The object appeared stright ahead of me at about 80 degrees and disappeared to the left at about 50 degrees above the horizion.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131

They were freaked out claiming that there was a bright flash of light like a camera flash that filled up all four of the kitchen windows which are on opposite walls.  I told them it was probably lightening or a transformer as it was rainy and a bit windy but no power was out and nothing seemed amiss when I looked around outside moments later. I asked them if they heard anything and my oldest daugher and her cousin whom are pre-teens said there was now way it was lightening and it didn't make a sound.  They were so scared and told me that you couldn't even see out the window it was so bright.  I still insisted it was probably a transformer or lightening and they kept saying, no...it was like a camera flash and then it happened again lots of times.  The other strange things were the animals, they could have been se! nsing the fear in the kids but they refused to go down the stairs and came running up the first time with the kids the cats were hiding upstairs...I don't know, but I still have chills and do not want to look outside my kitchen window at the field behind my home.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131

The triangle then started to expand & the one in the center just disappeared.   The other 3 started to change formation, into an isosceles triangle, still expanding when a 2nd one disappeared.  The 2 left, started to slowly get further away from each other and then a 3rd disappeared and then shortly after the 4th one disappeared.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
