Glowing, Egg-shaped object sighted over Puyallup, WA on March 2nd.;2001-03-02 20:24:00;10 seconds;Glowing, Egg-shaped object sighted over Puyallup, WA on March 2nd. I would like to start-out by saying that I am an expert on aircraft and flying, and can honestly saw that this object was not an aircraft, helicopter, or meteor, or any other man-made object.  The night went as follows:  My 2 friends and I were driving NNW on Highway 161 near Puyallup, WA when we saw an bronze-colored object fly overhead at an elevation of approx. 5500' above sea level. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed, around 700-750 mph, but showed no signs of it's propulsion system(i.e. afterburner flames,exhaust,etc.)  I could detect no noise being emitted from the object either.(Aircraft that fly that fast are most often VERY loud at low elevations.)  We followed it until it disappeared from sight approx.60-70 miles away.  It followed a straight path and did not change altitude or speed.  The object blinked-out at about 70 miles away.  One interesting piece of information is that it flew directly through the upwind leg of the landing pattern of Seatac Airport at a very dangerous altitude, violating FAA regulations.  Also, judging by its flight path, it most likely violated the airspace of McChord AFB also.  The AM radio in my car had slightly more static during the time when the object was overhead. I am more than willing to talk about it further.  Please call with any other questions.  Thank you for your services.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
