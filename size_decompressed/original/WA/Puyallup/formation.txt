((anonymous report));2017-11-18 21:30:00;3 minutes;On my drive home, going down 512 which is a freeway.  I noticed strange lights in the sky that I thought were planes.  I kept looking at them for the red and blue flashing lights that are on planes, but there were no flashing lights.  The 5 objects were bright lights.  Like balls of light.  They were first in a fish hook formation than the one of the bottom right went down and the others followed into a triangle position.  The bottom right vanished than the one on the bottom left vanished.  Leaving 3 lights remaining.  I kept going down 512 and could no long see the lights as I tried to keep looking over my shoulder to the left of me.  In my mirrors there was nothing left as I kept heading towards north.

5 craft seen, huge triangle of 3 move across sky in Puyallup, Wa. Helicopter heads toward it.;2019-08-24 21:35:00;7-10 minutes;5 craft seen, Huge triangle of 3 move across sky in Puyallup, Wa.  Helicopter heads toward it. 1.	  We were on a road driving west, when my son noticed 2 lights on the left (to the south of center in front of us) that were traveling an outdistance apart toward the North.  It was approximately 25-30 Degrees Further away, I would say 20 miles plus to the North was the front point of the triangle they formed.  This looked about 45-50 degrees  This thing was MASSIVE!  Iâ€™m not saying it was a solid object but the formation was massive.  None of these light were flashing.  Solid looking light. 2.	  An airplane, flashing, flew in front of the formation (on our side) and kept going.  It was about that time we heard and saw a HELICOPTER fly over us going toward the west toward the formation.  We could not tell the color of the chopper. 3.	  The lights kept traveling until the trees got in the way and we lost track of them.  The moved seemingly much slower than the airplane but could be because they were much further away. 4.  Two more craft (lights) arose over the horizon for a total of 5 now.  These two lights were just over the horizon started rising and took the same path of the others in formation. 5.	  WE DO HAVE VIDEO OF THE WHOLE THING!;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
3 lights hovering above horizon;2019-10-11 19:30:00;8-10 minutes;3 lights hovering above horizon Driving north on Meridian from Graham, we saw three lights in a triangle formation above the horizon (puyallup area). One was brighter and a bit bigger than the other two. We kept track of them as long as we could until they left our view. As far as we know they didnt move. The bigger of the three did suddenly change and get dimmer about 7 minutes in to us keeping track of it.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
