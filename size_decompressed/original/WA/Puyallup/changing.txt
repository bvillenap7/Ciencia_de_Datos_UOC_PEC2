Daylight sighting of shape-shifting UFO.;2013-01-31 12:00:00;5-10 minutes;Daylight sighting of shape-shifting UFO   On January 31, at 12:00pm, while my husband and I were driving North on Meridian in Puyallup, Washington, we noticed a small traffic helicopter traveling southbound above us at about 1000'.  What appeared to be another helicopter followed about a quarter of a mile behind it. While we were stopped in heavy traffic, the 2nd copter swayed erratically from side to side above the busy highway.  It stopped suddenly in mid-air, then turned sharply toward the east, all the while rapidly changing altitude.  It continued to sway from side to side and to bounce up and down. We could see it was not a helicopter, but was an extremely large cube or boxy silver object.  It morphed into an elongated box, then became a sphere and then a whole array of boxy shapes, as it hovered, and raised and lowered its altitude.  We saw no lights on it.  There were no vapors coming from it.  When it changed shape it would momentarily shine like a piece of reflective aluminum. Finally it just shot off to the northeast at a high rate of speed.  I was driving and had to focus on traffic, but my husband in the passenger seat watched the object until it disappeared completely.  The entire episode lasted approximately 5-10 minutes. It was high noon, the sky was a light grey, there was no rain, and no wind. Visibility was about five miles.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
Silent black shape-shifting UFO traveling towards moon along the horizon of setting sun. Puyallup wa, 06/09/14;2014-06-09 20:00:00;~1 hour;Silent black shape-shifting UFO traveling towards moon along the horizon of setting sun. Puyallup wa, 06/09/14 The sun was setting, the sky was blue and there were clouds speckled amongst it all.  I had been staring at a black object along the horizon for a few seconds, absent-mindedly, before asking my boyfriend “is that a plane or a bird?”  I still wasn’t really thinking anything though.  It was like it hadn’t hit me how unusual this object in the sky was, yet.  My boyfriend stated that it looked like a big balloon from one of the car dealerships nearby.   I thought about it for a second as I continued to stare but when I noticed that it was moving along the horizon at a steady, slow-paced, straight-lined course I began to think otherwise.  The UFO seemed to shape-shift from almost circular-looking to flat and triangular-kind of pyramid-esq.   The craft began to slowly ascend, I could see more of its energy field (which surrounding it in its entirety-the energy/light looked like a fan on high speed) the farther it traveled.  It took quite a while to begin looking smaller, but it disappeared about anywhere from 3-10 minutes after it appeared (or so it seemed, I hadn’t looked at the time).   My boyfriend went to grab some binoculars and told me to take some photos while he was gone, I took about 10 photos but the craft showed up in none of them even though it was still in plain sight/large enough to have shown up.  Through the binoculars there was a visible light source underneath the UFO.   Absolutely no noise what-so-ever.  Headed towards the moon.;47.1456971830985;-122.288996244131
