Light on Lewis River brighter than brightest star moved hundreds of miles very fast in non-linear fashion not a human craft.;2013-08-08 00:10:00;5 minutes;Light on Lewis River brighter than brightest star moved hundreds of miles very fast in non-linear fashion not a human craft. Me and 3 friends were nightfishing the Lewis River for summer steelhead and around midnight my friend spotted a light while looking for satellites.  The light looked like a star but brighter than the north star.   The night was clear and we did not mistake what we saw for something we had seen before.   It moved in lines that were not straight, at one point it moved in a right angle.  It stopped and started.   We watched it for 2-3 minutes and it stayed in a relatively small section of the sky.  Then it blinked out and reappeared very far away, hundreds of miles at least, and continued to fly in non straight lines until it blinked out for good.  The whole thing lasted about 5 minutes.
