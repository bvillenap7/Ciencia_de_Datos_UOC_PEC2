Cascading multi-colored lights in clouds.;2014-02-16 21:10:00;10 minutes;Cascading multi-colored lights in clouds. I was taking dog for a walk in a field.  The sky was overcast with ceilings around 2,000-3,000 feet.   At first I saw a flash that seemed like in-cloud lightning.  Being a trained weather observer and forecaster, this surprised me due to weather conditions not being favorable for lightning.   A few min later the clouds to the south lit up again, however this time the changed from white, to blue to red to green.   The light was cascading through the clouds and shifting in color from on to the next.  The lights went a way for a minute or two then started again.   After the lights faded there were no lights for about 5-6 min then I saw lights in the clouds much farther south closer to Portland.;45.9219;-122.7126
