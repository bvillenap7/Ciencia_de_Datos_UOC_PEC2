My first thought was that they recently changed the street lamps because it was SO much brighter than normal. After getting a better look, we realized it was hovering higher than the street lights in the distance. It looked about the size of a half dollar. After about 10 seconds, it started to zip away. Almost instantly, it disappeared. I mean, it literally looked like it traveled at warp speed, leaving a white trail behind it momentarily. This was the first of 2 UFOs I have ever seen, so we got back to my friend's house and ran inside screaming. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
