Saucer shaped craft at roof level just hovering, round windows along the side and dome in the middle.;1971-09-20 16:00:00;6 minutes;Saucer shaped craft at roof level just hovering, round windows along the side and dome in the middle. My roomate and I were riding on a greyhound bus on Interstate 5.  We were going home for a visit from college in Portland Oregon to Longview Washington.  Right before entering Woodland Washington we passed a huge freshly plowed field.  In the middle of this huge field was a two story farmhouse. I was just casually looking at the view when I saw a saucer shaped disc hovering at roof level of this home. It was brown, saucer shaped with a dome in the middle. It appeared to be as long as the roof of the house. Along the side of this craft there were windows, round ones and at one end of it a fin? or something slightly projecting upward like a tail or a shark fin.  It just hovered there at roof level and moved ever so slightly.  Underneath this craft there was some turbulence like the bushes appeared to be swaying bath and forth. I told my roomate about this and told her were to look and she took one long stare, turned to me and said....... If you tell anybody about this I will deny it! This scene lasted the entire time it took to pass from view. I never did tell anybody for years.  It still haunts me to this day so to tell someone who will listen is a cleansing moment for me.  I am truly not alone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));45.9219;-122.7126
