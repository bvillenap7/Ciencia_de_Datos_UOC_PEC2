They were flying very close too each other and one was bigger than the other.  They were both either white or reflective (hard to tell).  They were flying quite slow for about 90 seconds then speed up rapidly and I lost visual.  They also made a deep humming like noise that was far different from any airplane or helicopter I have heard before .  There was also a slight glow around object. Immediately after I lost visual of the 2 UFOs there was an unmarked plan that entered the area and I believe it was pursuing the 2 UFOs.;45.9219;-122.7126
