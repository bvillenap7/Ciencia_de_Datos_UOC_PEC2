I thought it was a transformer blowing up because the flash of light was so bright but as I continued driving east the flash of bright light continued.  It would flash and then go dark for about 30 seconds and then flash again, this was continuous.  It was not moving just flashing on and off.  I continued to drive east and was almost parallel to it but it was up above the hills.  I pulled over as did two other cars to see if we could tell what it was but it wasn't recognizable.  It was too high to be any sort of tower and it didn't seem to be any type of aircraft that was recognizable since it wasn't moving - just staying in the same spot up in the sky.  I left because I had to go to work but I witnessed this thing for about 15 minutes. I have driven this route every morning for 12 years and have never seen this ! before.;45.9219;-122.7126
