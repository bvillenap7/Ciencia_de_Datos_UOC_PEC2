Three very bright, extreamly fast globes of white light;1971-08-15 23:00:00;15 seconds;Three very bright, extreamly fast globes of white light Many family members had been visiting at my parents house in the country along the Lewis river east of Woodland.  We were leaving.  The sky was clear.  It was about 11 PM.  Several of us were walking down their drive way, we were facing east.  A very bright light, it looked more like a round glob of intense white light streaked from west to east over our heads.  There was no noise.  It went from above us to the horizon in a couple of seconds.  I asked what it was and just started up at the sky.  A few seconds later two objects indentcal to the first streaked overhead going the same direction.  I had spent four years in the Air Force were I had worked on the radar and weapons systems electronics.  Any plane I had seen could not have appeared to move that fast unless it had been on the deck and moving at least a couple hundred miles an hour.  In which case there would have been not silence but at very loud roar. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));45.9219;-122.7126
