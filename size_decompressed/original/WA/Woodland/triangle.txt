Approx. one-second intervals color would switch from red to orange,red, etc.  The craft hovered directly above our rural property, one teal light turned off.  The poultry, neighbors' horses, and dogs all stopped in their tracks.  One dog, Butch, sat down and stared up toward the craft. The craft flew straight up, paused for a moment then zipped away toward Mt. St. Helen's NW side. All animals resumed normal activities when craft was gone.;45.9219;-122.7126
Three lights over Woodland, WA.;2011-04-08 23:00:00;1 Minute;Three lights over Woodland, WA. I was outside with my wife looking at the moon through our telescope, when she was using and adjusting the telescope I was watching the sky north of us, towards Seattle.  I saw three white lights moving north simultaneously in a triangular shape, never straying away from each other.  No flashing lights or sound was present from the object. It moved north at a steady pace. This plane or whatever it was, looked to be very large from my perception maybe 100ft. to 150ft. wide.  I could not make out the length from the rear to the front of the object.  It kept moving north until the light pollution in the horizon was too bright to see anything it looked as if it disappeared.;45.9219;-122.7126
