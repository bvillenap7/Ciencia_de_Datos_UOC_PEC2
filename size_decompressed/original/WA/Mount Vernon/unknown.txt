Dark object with three lights on the bottom arranged in a triangle;2005-12-06 19:30:00;2 minutes;Dark object with three lights on the bottom arranged in a triangle I was driving north on I-5 at the Snohomish/Skagit county border, and right at the border line this thing flew across the freeway.  It seemed to be going very slowly, but extremely fast at the same time.  I don't know what the shape of the aircraft is, as it was pitch black out (Washington State=cloudy), but there were three somewhat dim lights on the bottom that shone straight down that were arranged in a triangle.  I nearly got in a wreck while I was watching-whatever it was, I have never seen one before-and I did not see any flashing lights on the sides (if there were sides, I am not sure), so I am almost sure it was not an airplane.  It flew from East to West, and it appeared to be headed for the refineries at Anacortes, which is in a Westerly direction from Mount Vernon.  However, there is an air force base on Whidbey Island, which is also West of Mt. Vernon, so perhaps this was some experimental stealth aircraft.  However, if it was, I would recommend that they turn their lights off next time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

High speed UFO possible sighting.;2008-08-02 23:02:00;2 min 15 sec;High speed UFO possible sighting. Retired military aviation specialist noted extremely bright steady white lighting at upper atmosphere level.  Traveled from southern horizon two thirds toward northern horizon. Traveled distance in less than one minute.  Sopped to hover at the northernmost juncture, reversed course approximately 120 degrees, then disappeared from view at an rapid pace almost vertically.  Expertise noted that object travelled at hypersonic speed with abrupt change of direction and azimuth not consistant with man-made object.  G-forces evident beyond human tolerance, and no exhaust trail or sound of sound barrier being broken.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907

During the 3rd week of November 09 ( I dont remember the exact day) my husband and I were watching a movie. We had rented Transformers and had it on REALLY loud. It was between 10-11pm (I think), during a very loud part of the movie, I thought I heard what sounded like thunder, but then I realized that that would have been some of the loudest thunder Ive ever heard in my life. I looked at my husband, he heard it too. We then paused our movie and listened. We both heard what I can only descibe as a huge jet way too close to our house and only getting louder, then for about half a second, silence and then a huge boom that shook our entire house! We thought for sure there was just a massive plane crash very near our house and ran outside. It of course being Washington, it was raining and we couldnt see anything. Within minutes, we heard 3 seperate helicopters coming from different areas. At that point, we were confident that we would definitly be hearing about this in the news the next morning. Morning came and there was nothing. I spent hours online searching for the smallest piece of report that we werent the only ones that heard and felt whatever this was. Nothing in the papers, online or of course on the news. Its as if it never happened. I just want to make very clear, that whatever this was, when it crashed our house shook like it was an earthquake. We live in Mount Vernon, WA. My husband has seen some strange things in the sky here in the same area before and we saw strange lights a few years ago out towards Deception Pass, we just cant simply think of anything else it could have been.
