Sorry Peter, I didn't see this form before e mailing you. The object made no sound, had no lights, no haze or beams, no trail like a piece of space debris (or another Russian booster!) and was only visible through 45 degrees of arc because of backscatter from ground light.  It was really moving as evident short time of visual lock and the amount of sky it covered, in my estimation made it supersonic. Thank you;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907
strange red lighted craft, wobbling right to left then shooting straight up;2000-01-14 06:30:00;15 seconds;strange red lighted craft, wobbling right to left then shooting straight up My eighteen year old son was waiting for the bus this morning at 6:30 a.m.in Mt.Vernon,Washington. Sky was still dark. He looked to the south of our house (we live in the open country),about 5 miles away he saw a red light about as big as a full moon, it looked as if it was coming straight for him, then it wobbled left to right like a falling leaf and shot straight up and disappeared. The red light wasn't blinking, it was shining steadily. At one point he said there was a beam of white light coming from the object. He came in running to tell me, he was excited and scared. He said it was very strange because if it had been an airplane he would have heard the motors, that's how close it was. But as it was there was no sound at all. He didn't hear anyone else talk about seeing it so he didn't bring the subject up.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907
