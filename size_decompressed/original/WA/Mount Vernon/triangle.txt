What is out there?;2001-06-25 00:00:00;2-3 minutes;What is out there? My friend and I were watching the stars in his front yard, when I noticed three stars in a triangle shape, slowly start to move.  I was speechless.  All I could do was tap my friend and point.  The UFO made a take off then shot across the sky where another UFO began to zig zag all over the sky.   My friend and I jumped up out of our sleeping bags, then ran around the house to follow the UFO's but they were nearly out of site headed over a Mountian.  The single UFO shot across the sky zig zaging at a crazy speed, shooting all over the sky, faster than any aircraft could, then eventually disapeared over the hill. My firend and I were high school seniors at the time.  I had forgoten all about it until a resent visit to his home.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907

At 2:00 a.m. on April 9, 2009, my two friends and I were leaving to pick up another friends when one of my friends noticed a weird formation of lights in the sky. He said that he had never seen them before and asked us if we had.  We said that we hadn't.  The 6 or 7 lights appeared to be moving slowly, but staying in the same general area.  We all took out our cell phones to videotape the lights, but they disappeared before we could get zoomed in.  The lights simply turned off. The lights were too high in the sky to be from a building or tower and they moved too much. For the next few days, I searched the internet for similar sightings and found this website where there was a video of the exact same formation of lights.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907
Large, silent, triangular craft moving very fast, stopping suddenly, then disappearing.;2012-08-11 23:10:00;10 seconds;Large, silent, triangular craft moving very fast, stopping suddenly, then disappearing. I was on my back porch, watching the Perseids meteor shower. I saw a triangular shaped, extremely fast moving object, gliding from north to south, directly overhead. It crossed about 2/3 of the sky in about 5 seconds, much faster than any aircraft could do. It was completely silent. It stopped dead in one spot in the southern half of the sky and stayed in place for a moment. I pointed at it and said, &quotI see you!&quot The triangle rotated in place, and then the lights faded out completely. This is the second time I have seen this type of craft -- the only UFO sightings in my life. The other one was in a different state, but it also appeared during the Perseids meteor shower and behaved almost exactly the same, except it faded away rather than stopping in one spot first. In both cases, there was a kind of shimmery appearance surrounding the object. I am not sure how big the craft was, but it had to be several times larger than any sort of airplane. It was difficult to tell how high its elevation was.  If it was flying where one would expect a plane to be (30-40,000 feet), I would have to guess that it was massive, maybe 300 feet across?  If it was higher than that, I have no idea how big it could have been.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907

Shimmering object gliding across the sky much faster than any aircraft.;2016-07-23 22:15:00;>1 minute;Shimmering object gliding across the sky much faster than any aircraft. I was sitting with my wife on our back porch, looking at stars and planets.  I was telling her about a triangle shaped craft I saw about two years ago.  I said, I was looking at a spot between some stars, when-- and at that moment, a shimmering craft appeared as two points of light and seemed to glide across the sky, much faster than any aircraft I know of.  I said, Do you see that?  She did not see it.  It very quickly moved toward the northeast, when I said, out loud, Wait, she doesn't see you, come back.  At that point, the craft stopped moving, shimmered again, and was not visible. This is nearly identical to the sighting I had two years ago, except the craft had three points of light then, moved toward the southeast, and did the same stop and vanish when I said I see you.  My wife was inside the house that time.  This time she was with me, but she did not see the craft.  It was probably only visible for 10 seconds or less. We stopped talking and looked up at the area where the craft had appeared.  It felt like about 5-10 minutes passed, and then I asked her why she thought it only appeared to me.  She was uncomfortable talking about it outside, so we went inside.  At that point we looked at the clock, and we had been outside for about 30 minutes.  We both experienced the time as roughly 15 minutes, maybe 20 at most, but 30 minutes had elapsed according to my cell phone and the clock inside.  Our dog reacted as if we had been outside for a long time, barking the way he does when we get home after being gone for awhile.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907
Very loud triangle  craft with lights that don't blink;2018-08-14 22:07:00;10 minutes;Very loud triangle  craft with lights that don't blink I was home watching TV alone when I heard what I thought was a big helicopter coming up the valley.  The noise became so loud that it shook the windows, so I got up to see expecting to see a sky crane or a couple of big chinook choppers because it was way too much noise to be just one.  I scanned the sky and identified the source of the sound.  The object appeared stationary with nothing else around it.  I noticed also it appeared to be slowly rotating and the sound was changing.  I decided to grab my camera and after many attempts got 1 decent photo.  The sound started to change and I would say sounded like a pulsing rocket engine.  I called my friend who lives north of me and asked him to go outside to see if he could hear it.  He could.  The craft turned and drifted slowly to the North about 20 miles an hour.  I told my friend it was coming his way but he could not see it.  It slowly turned to the west and drifted over the bay.  After the craft went out of site a single fighter jet came over the house in a broad turn on a similar course, but with a wide berth like it was flying in a much larger circle.  About a minute later 2 more fighters flew similar course. I would say the craft was less then a mile away and approximately 3500 feet up and the size was comparable to a B2 bomber. It moved with the point to the rear as it went buy but I think it was slowly  rotating.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907
Triangular lights, high in the night sky.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-28 20:00:00;&lt1min;Triangular lights, high in the night sky While stargazing with the assistance of a Gen.3 White Phosphor night vision device, I observed three lights which maintained a consistent triangle formation, very high up in the night sky.  The lights were first observed to the S/SW 30-40 degrees off the horizon, and passed high overhead, continuing to the north horizon in only about 30-45 seconds of time.  I don’t believe I would have seen it with the naked eye.  When the lights passed in front of other celestial objects, they were momentarily blocked, suggesting some shape/solidity/mass detween the three lights observed (so I believed it to be a triangular object).  The rear two lights seemed to move occasionally, relative to each other, in a manner I could only describe as ‘wagging wings’.  No sound was heard, or other lights observed.  This thing was high, and FAST. Just incredible!  I’ve seen shooting stars, satellites, the International Space Station... NEVER anything like this before.
