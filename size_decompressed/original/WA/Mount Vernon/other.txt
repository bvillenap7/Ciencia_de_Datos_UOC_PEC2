Gray, Jellyfish-shaped object with lights seen in photograph taken of clouds.;2010-04-28 12:53:00;moment;Gray, Jellyfish-shaped object with lights seen in photograph taken of clouds. My father and I were driving south on Interstate 5, and had just entered Mount Vernon, WA, just before the College Way exit, when I took the first of three pictures of the clouds on my cell phone for my boyfriend, who often remarks about the dramatic nature of Skagit Valley clouds. I emailed myself these pictures from my phone, and upon downloading them that evening, I noticed, in the first picture I had taken, an object in the sky that was not visible in the sky when I took the picture: a large, gray, jellyfish-shaped object with at least four distinct legs and three prominent lights and two lesser lights. I have a much more interesting picture to send my boyfriend than I anticipated! ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the object is either an insect, about to strike the windshield, or a crack in the windshield.  PD));48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907

Unknown lights over Mount Vernon, Washington.;2015-05-12 21:20:00;3 minutes;Unknown lights over Mount Vernon, Washington. I was going out to my car to put something in the trunk and I happened to look up in the sky. What I saw was this bright orange/red light slowly across the sky.  I first thought that it was either a plane or a helicopter but then I noticed that there was no engine sound at all.   The next thing that I noticed was that there were things dropping from it like sparks that drop from a sparkler.   All of a sudden it made a 90 degree left turn ( toward me ) and just hovered there.   All that time I still did not hear any engine sound at all.  After about two minutes, it seemed like, the thing started to go straight up and the light faded and pretty soon I could not see it at all. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We strongly suspect that the report is accurate.  PD));48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907
