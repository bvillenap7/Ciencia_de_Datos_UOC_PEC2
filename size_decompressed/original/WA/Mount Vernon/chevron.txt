Overhead passed a chevrolet tahoe that was black, but it was kind of foggy and hard to see. Red beams of light shot out of the headlight and my neighbors cat mysteriously disappeared that night. A man sat in the passenger seat that looked like George W. Bush and he peeled off some sort of maske and it looked like an extraterrestrial, but once again it was kind of hard to see because it was foggy. ((NUFORC Note:  Obvious hoax.
