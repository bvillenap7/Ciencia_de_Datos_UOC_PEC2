Multi color flashing lights in sky.;2011-01-09 19:00:00;30+ minutes;Multi color flashing lights in sky. It was at night of course and I was taking out the trash.  We had just weathered a snow storm but the sky had completely cleared up and you could see the starts.  So I stood outside in the freezing cold for a few minutes to admire, Orion was just becoming visible.   As I started to walk back inside I noticed a flicker in the sky.  At first I thought that it was just a bright star twinkling.  I stood for a minute looking with my naked eye and there appeared to be a red, green and bright white light flasing in the sky.  It kinda looked like the lights on top of a police car, how they spin around.   So I went inside to get the binos, and my husband to show him to see that Im not seeing things.  We both watched it for a bit, he went back inside and I stayed there watching through the binos.  After about 15 minutes of watching this thing, which had not moved at all, something shot out from the left of it. It was just a dim white light, it moved to the north for about 10 se! conds and disappeared.  My kids forced me inside but I stood outside long enough to freeze to the ground.  I managed to get a picture of it but you cant tell at all what it is nor does it look as clear as what I was seeing through the binos.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907
Ultra-bright flash seen in night sky over south Skagit Co. on 01/24/2012.;2012-01-24 22:30:00;Split-Second;Ultra-bright flash seen in night sky over south Skagit Co. on 01/24/2012. I live in south Mount Vernon, near the Snohomish/Skagit County border.   I am reporting because I saw the same split-second ultra-bright flash previously reported on by a resident of Bellingham, WA (Occurred 1/16/2012 3:30), though my sighting of such flash occurred the night of 1/24/2012.  I had stepped outside, sometime between 10 & 11pm, because my dogs were barking and I thought it might be coyotes near my house again.  About 2 min. passed and I suddenly saw a very rapid, ultra-bright flash in the sky to the immediate south of my house.  The flash did not appear to be lightning, but I waited for over half an hour for the sound of thunder, as would follow had it actually been, and never heard a thing.   I was going to keep this incident to myself until I realized I wasn't alone in such a sighting.  As I have no experience with such phenomena, is this typical of “winter lightning”, as questioned upon by the Bellingham poster?  I am itching with curiosity to know what it was.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907
