I did not see the craft itself, only continuous red lights in the night sky.  The lights were not flashing. The upper light was arched with the center higher than the ends. The lower light was arched in the opposite direction with the center lower than the ends.  When I first saw the lights they were at a distance from and moving away from me.  The two lights gave the appearance of being in the front and rear of an oval or a circular craft.  The right and left sides had no lights that were visible to me.  The visible lights could have each extended approximately one third the distance around the craft.  The craft moved toward the lights of the city and behind a tall tree that blocked my vision of the red lights.  There was no engine or propeller noise.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907
