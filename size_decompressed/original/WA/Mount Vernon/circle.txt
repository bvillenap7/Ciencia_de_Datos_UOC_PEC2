Red object seen high in sky over Western Washington;2007-11-05 19:00:00;8:00;Red object seen high in sky over Western Washington I was on my way to Mount Vernon from Sedro Woolley when looking to the South I saw a very bright red circular object very high in the sky.   I could not see the exact shape as it was among the clouds, however it was so bright it was as if on fire. The object did not seem to be moving but just hung there.  I was on the phone to my sister at the time and asked her to turn on her TV to see if there were any news reports about it but there were none.  I would guess it was in the direction of Seattle some where down in that area, it was hard for me to tell. It must have been big. I am a health care provider.;48.4275116279071;-122.195811627907
