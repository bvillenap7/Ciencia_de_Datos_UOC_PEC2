There could have been more but we had a bunch of cars behind us honking to go and we had to go.  So we drove about 1/4 mile down the street to a round-a-bout where we turned around to go back and observe. We got back just in time to see the last few exit the atmosphere.  They were definitely intelligently navigated and looked nothing like a plane nor a helicopter or any other man made flying craft ive ever seen.  As we drove the 20 miles home we saw another one coming towards us as we were heading toward the freeway to get home and again at Trosper road in Tumwater the craft flew over us again t! his time headed towards Olympia.  These two craft were cruising at a low altitude it seemed. I know I've seen other UFO's in my life, but never this many all at once.  Then when I got home I decided to search youtube to see if anybody video taped it and I found several videos of the exact same UFO's we saw.  I also found some similar videos from July 4th 2011.  I know what I saw and I know I'm not the only one seeing these.;47.024;-122.7827
