Yellow/Red Slow Moving Craft and Two Flashing Starlike Objects Over Lacey, WA;2004-07-25 22:07:00;5 minutes;Yellow/Red Slow Moving Craft and Two Flashing Starlike Objects Over Lacey, WA Traveling, by car, north on Ruddell Rd SE, starting at the junction of Ruddell and Yelm Hwy, I noticed a bright yellow light about 40 degrees above the horizon. The light appeared to be traveling slowly south-southwest. I initially thought it was a planet, but it was clearly moving. I then assumed it was an aircraft. However, I could see no other lights and no flashing on the craft. As I turned east onto Mullen Rd I noticed that the light had turned red and appeared elongated. This change prompted me to pull into a parking lot to get a better look. At the same moment I noticed two smaller starlike objects in the same area of the sky. They flashed like strobe lights, and appeared to jump up and down as they continued on their trajectories. There was also an easily identified airplane flying east of the objects, apparently at the same altitude. The objects eventually went behind some tall trees and I lost sight of them.  My conclusions: the red object may have been a blimp or some kind of personal craft. I suspect the craft had a yellow headlight or spotlight, which ceased to be visible as I traveled north and as the craft passed me moving south. The starlike objects could have been very high altitude jets passing over the region coincidentally. Because of the flashing of the starlike objects, it was hard to tell their flight paths. One or both of them may have changed direction, but I am not certain of this.  The main reason I'm reporting this incident is that others in the region may have seen it and may be able to provide more information.  Observer background: I am a hospital manager with an MBA and more than a passing interest in astronomy and the UFO phenomenon.;47.024;-122.7827
Early this Sunday, at approximately 12:05am, while meditating, I saw a very bright object in eastern sky over Lacey, Washington.  The o;2005-03-13 00:05:00;Ten minutes;Early this Sunday, at approximately 12:05am, while meditating, I saw a very bright object in eastern sky over Lacey, Washington.  The object had a slight purple color to it.  I would not have paid much attention to it, except that it was so bright and seemed to be falling/moving.  Perhaps more accurately, it appeared to be moving towards me.  This naturally made me think that it was an airplane.  However, I saw no red lights and the movement of the object was unlike that of any airplane.  The object would move a bit, then stop, and then would seem to move a bit more.  I watched the object for approximately 5 to 10 minutes.  I closed my eyes for a time, maybe another ten minutes.  When I looked again, the object had vanished.;47.024;-122.7827
We saw the moving star as well!!;2008-08-12 23:00:00;1+ hour;We saw the moving star as well!! I understand that reporting this so far from the date it occurred may discredit it, but I just couldn't help myself after seeing the sighting posting for 8/12/2008 at 23:30.   Around 11pm on that night my brother was taking the dog out to use the bathroom before going to bed.  What he described as happening was that out of the corner of his eye he caught what he thought was a meteor or a bright shooting star that just simply stopped above the house (so to speak).  He said that he looked at it for less than a minute trying to figure out what he just saw, when what appeared to be a star in the same area moved in a circle.  My brother then called me, so I went outside and looked but failed to see what he was (mind you I live only about a mile away from him).  At this point I drove over to his house and had him point out what I was looking for.  The star didn't move for about 5 minutes, and after ridiculing him for getting me out of bed, the star moved EXACTLY like he said, as well as what was described in the other report this is pertaining to. We watched it for roughly an hour just occasionally moving in a circle, side to side, or in that kind of hook shape that was mentioned in the other report.  It never even occurred to me to report the event because we all felt like we were a little crazy or just seeing things.  It honestly just looked like your average star.;47.024;-122.7827
A star-like object, moving in hooks, fast streams, and circles stayed above the house until I was tired and went inside.;2008-08-12 23:30:00;1.5+ hours;A star-like object, moving in hooks, fast streams, and circles stayed above the house until I was tired and went inside. At around 11:30 PM, I walked into my backyard so I could witness a meteor shower that was about to occur in 30 minutes. At this time, I was scanning the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of an early meteor. I didn’t see anything yet, however I did see a bright light in the sky the was obviously moving to the east, to my 10 o’clock position, and it looked like it was over my neighbors house. I at first thought it was a satellite, so I ignored it, however after 5 minutes, it was still there, moving ever so slowly. When I really watched it for a good 30 seconds, I realized this object was actually moving in circles, zigzags, quick lines from side to side, and small hooks. Confused at what I was seeing, I laid there staring at this thing. When I saw it move about 5 inches across the sky directly over my house in 2, VERY fast back to back streaks, I alerted others inside the house. Myself and 3 others continued to watch this star-like object move for as long as we could lay out there. I believe it’s still there, and it is now 12:35 AM. I doesn’t really change its quadrant of the sky, it just moves rapidly, in hooks, and side to side motions, gradually, then faster, then slower again as it ends its maneuver. It appears to just look like a star, but due to its obvious, rapid, in-human like movements, it is clearly not. I also saw a very dim star move towards it, then dissapear as it came next to it. It appeared to leave a faint red-ish trail a microfiber long.;47.024;-122.7827

On 12-12-11 at 8:11, I saws green light to the SE of Lacey.;2011-12-12 20:11:00;1-2 seconds;On 12-12-11 at 8:11, I saws green light to the SE of Lacey. On 12-12-11 I was headed northbound on I-5 at mile marker 108 (estimated)! I witnessed a green ball of light enter my field of vision on the right.  This light was headed towards the ground at a 75 degree angle.  The green light then disappeared into the treeline.  The light was moving so fast it was evident that it wasn't simply falling, in fact the light only took a fraction af a second to pass through my view. If I held my hand out at arms length and imagined the light was between my fingers, it would have been about the size of a pea. This took place at 20:11, I know this because I lost a phone call just seconds before seeing the light and the call was returned immediately as I was seeing the light. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere and objective.  A tragic helicopter crash occurred at Ft. Lewis Army Base, at approximately the time of the sighting.  We only mention this fact, which the witness commented about.  We have no reason to believe that there is any correlation between the sighting and the crash.  PD));47.024;-122.7827
Military helicopter chases white light object.;2012-01-11 23:25:00;8 Seconds;Military helicopter chases white light object. I was at the intersection of Martin Way and Carpenter Rd in Lacey/Olympia and viewed a military helicopter traveling Northwest in parallel with Martin Way in pursuit of a white light object in front of it about 50-100 yards moving at the exact same speed together heading north/northweast towards JBLM. Object looked like a distant star but was directly infront of the helicopter, size was about the size of a large beachball in comparison to the military helicopter with a white light emitting from it like a star.;47.024;-122.7827
