It occurred four times at uneven intervals over a one hour period, approximately 0130 - 0230 early morning 1/29/2012.  The first three flashes were approximately 5-10 minutes apart the last occurred about 30 minutes later.  Broken cloud cover and relatively low ceiling sky condition.  Flash effect (shadowing) and intensity (brightness) were similar to what would be expected of a camera flash discharging within about 50 feet of my bedroom window except appeared to originate from the sky, entering my window downward.  No aircraft could be heard - I listened carefully and looked for one.  No vehicle or pedestrian activity on my street at that time - again, I got up, listened, and looked.  No known thunder storm activity in the local vicinity.  No immediate explanation for this.  My oldest son witnessed it once before about a month ago during the holidays.  He was standing outside when it happened.  He claims it was brighte! r than I described.;47.024;-122.7827
