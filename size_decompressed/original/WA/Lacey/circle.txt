It seemed to change shape and look more like a circle.  It was moving slightly and came a little closer to us into a cloud.  It seemed that it should have disappered while in the cloud but we both could it see it brightly in the thick cloud.  It went backwards from the cloud and seemed to stay in one spot for a long time.  It always flashed the lights.  We got binoculars and could easily see red and green lights.  We tried to film it but was shaking badly but we did get it on our camcorder.  It was so far away like a star or an airplane in the sky however it was not an airplane or star that we have ever observed before.  I was so certain of its oddity that I phoned the Lacey police and reported the ufo and called my mom and asked her to look for it too.  It was to the left of what I think is venus.;47.024;-122.7827

Bright flashing orb spotted in broad daylight over Lacey, WA.;2015-06-25 10:30:00;15 minutes;Bright flashing orb spotted in broad daylight over Lacey, WA. I was outside on a break and a flash in the sky caught my eye.  This was at ~10:30am and sky conditions were clear.  It appeared to be a hovering orb at very high altitude.  I thought it could be a planet or star at first but it was a bright/sunny day.   I had 4 other co-workers come outside to confirm what I was seeing and they all confirmed it was something unknown.   We then noticed that the orb was moving to the west very slowly and still flashing white, red, and gold colors.  After about 5 mins of tracking it, it changed directions to the east and was directly over us (we were looking straight up).   Again, this orb was at a VERY high altitude.  We would lose site of it for a few moments only to have it flash back into view.;47.024;-122.7827
Bright reddish pulsing light, that floats around in the sky erratically.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Venus??  PD));2017-01-23 18:00:00;current;There is a bright reddish pulsing light, that floats around in the sky erratically.  On clear night I see it and it moves and other smaller lights appear near it and then disappear.  I have seen it zip, back and forth a faster than the eye lateral movement. I have been seeing this light in the sky for about 2 weeks.  It takes a similar path in the sky and when the sun sets and it is in different origin.  But a relatively near the same patch of sky.
