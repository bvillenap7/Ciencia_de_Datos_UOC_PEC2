Two flashes of light in the sky.;2006-03-15 01:00:00;short;Two flashes of light in the sky. I went outside saw a flash of light that looked like it could have been lighting but it was only in a section of the sky that was pretty small.  Then a second flash.  I waited to see if there was anymore but after about 3 mins went back inside.  I have never seen anything like this before and with the clouds couldn't see a craft of anything so it may not be a UFO but when I searched flash of light and covington this site was one of the first to pop up on google.  I sure would like to know what it was.  I have not seen a UFO since I was a kid.   I didn't hear any thunder either so that with the small area of the sky it occuipied leave me to believe it is something other than lightning.;47.3537;-122.1294
