My brother and I were in my backyard enjoying the great weather. My brother looked up and saw something. He told me and I looked as well. We saw 12 bright objects in the sky, moving.I grabbed my video recorder and stated taping them. They moved around as if the wind was moving them and also deliberatley in straight lines. Sometimes there would be a couple that were stationary and one would move away from them. My tape has also been viewed by a retired air force pilot and he said they are definately ufo's.They were appx. at 85 degrees up toward the north east above the cascade range. This is no joke.;47.3537;-122.1294
