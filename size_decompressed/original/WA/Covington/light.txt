Strange light in Covington, WA;1992-07-07 01:00:00;30 minutes;Strange light in Covington, WA I start this out with this is not a joke.   I was sitting outside and saw what at first I assumed was a plane coming over the horizon.   Then the object stopped and hovered while seeming to bounce around in the sky also making extremely rapid lateral movements.   This object resembled a twinkleing star but was about 3 times larger. I have no idea what this is, its quite a ways off but I should be able to hear if it was a motor driven unit.  Still visable by the way.  Just looked out the window.;47.3537;-122.1294
Extremely bright white light in the eastern sky from covington, wa, slow moving.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter sighting.  PD));2010-08-24 22:00:00;4 Hours;Extremely bright white light in the eastern sky from covington, wa, slow moving. I have been seeing an extremely, extrmely, bright white light in the sky for about the past month, at least ten times brighter than any start in the sky easily.  It appears at about 10pm pacific rising from the horizon to the east to about midway in the sky, then changes course and heads south for about an hour, then changes course again and heads west.  It travels very slowly, taking about 3-4 hours to cross the sky, but moves considerabley faster than any star in the sky. Each time it changes course it pauses for about ten or so minutes and looks to wobble slightly back and forth bfore continuing. Ive checked star maps and i can see nothign indicating a star or planet anywhere near this brightness in the sky in that direction. Its really creeping me out!   Before a month ago ive never seen it before and ive lived here for my whole life, and after the first sighting, it dissapeared for a full week (i scanned the sky every night for hours) and re appeared exactly one week later at almost the exact same time and has been out almost every day since, with the exception of it dissapearing a couple times and re appearing later.

Came down from sky fast then disappeared for 1 second, then reappeared a little higher, and went downwards quickly.
