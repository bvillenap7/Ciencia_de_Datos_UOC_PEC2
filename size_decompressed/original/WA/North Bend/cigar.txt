It was moving slowly but disappeared suddenly. I noticed this craft in the sky in the Cascade foothills while driving east this morning.  The elevation seemed to low for a commerical aircraft and it wasn't moving very fast.  It appeared to be heading west.   Anyway I thought it was strange because is appeared dark and was shaped like a pen or cigar.  It looked like this line ---- but thicker.  I was trying to watch it and drive.   Then some bright lights appeared on it and I thought maybe it was a plane with landing lights.  I lost sight of it while I passed some trees, I was going to pull over when I saw it again but it had completely disappeared!   I found that puzzeling because it was only out of my sight for a few seconds.  If it was a plane, where did it go?;47.4797;-121.7505
