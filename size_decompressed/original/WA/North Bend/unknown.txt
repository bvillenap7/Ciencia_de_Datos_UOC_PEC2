Unidentified object in Western Washington sky on a bright sunny morning.;2011-08-16 11:55:00;20 minutes;Unidentified object in Western Washington sky on a bright sunny morning. I witnessed an unknown object in the sky from my vantage point in North Bend, WA.  At 11:55 am I saw a metallic reflection in the Western sky.  The object was VERY distant.  It did not move.  It reflected the sunlight and when I looked at it with my naked eye, appeared to rotate.  I had my binoculars with me and the object was still to distant to discern any tell tale identifying characteristics.  Through the binoculars it appeared to shimmer different colors - red - blue and green.  My neighbor and his two grand kids saw it too.  I pointed it out to another gentleman who saw it as well.  I went into the store and came out and it was gone.  I watched the object for a total of fifteen minutes.;47.4797;-121.7505
