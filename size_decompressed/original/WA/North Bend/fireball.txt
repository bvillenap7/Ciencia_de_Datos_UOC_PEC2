Falling Fire Ball seen in North Bend area of Washinton State.;2001-10-15 20:45:00;3 seconds;Falling Fire Ball seen in North Bend area of Washinton State. On October 15th at approximately 8:45 PM I was heading west on I-90 approximately 2 miles west of the Denny Creek area, located in Washington State. I saw what looked like a flaming mass, about the size of a quarter at arms length, emitting blue and yellow/green flames as it traveled from east to west. It appeared out the drivers side window, (just to the south of my location) and traveled west at a very high rate of speed, (approximately 15 miles in 3 seconds). As it came into view through the front window, it appeared to go out or off just for an instant. The colors were very bright making it appear to be only about 2000 feet above my location. I heard no sounds. It had a downward heading of approximately 10 to 15 degrees leading me to think it was going to hit the ground in the Maple valley/Kent areas. It disappeared from my view when it fell behind the hills in the North Bend area. ((NUFORC Note:  Many witnesses to this event.   The subsiding, and reappearing of the light's brilliance, is confirmed by a sky camera, located in Courtenay, B.C..  PD));47.4797;-121.7505
