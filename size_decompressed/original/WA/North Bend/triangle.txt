Silent Triangle lights moving strangely around mount si(north bend);2019-09-17 05:00:00;45 minutes;Silent Triangle lights moving strangely around mount si(north bend) Taking my wife to work at 5am after dropping her off noticed a strange set of lights near Mount Si.  Decided to investigate.  Followed the lights up a road we called county line, it’s a dirt road goes very very deep into the woods all the way to Idaho iv been told..  The lights appeared to be in a triangle shape but would move and change position and altitude at times.  Couldn’t see the shape of the actual craft just that the lights were in a triangle shape maybe 40ft apart each.  At one moment one light went off and it was just two.  It was changing altitude rapidly and made no sound at all. I followed it maybe 30 minutes up county line before I lost sight of it.  Took a video but it just looks like all the other ufo videos of lights in the sky.;47.4797;-121.7505
