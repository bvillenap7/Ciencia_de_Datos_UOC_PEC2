My daughter was walking the family dog when the dog hair stood up and started barking fiercely. My daughter looked up and saw a small saucer shaped object with red and green lights blinking around it. The object was wobbling showing both top and bottom.  The object suddenly formed into an arrowhead shape with the lights also conforming to that shape. And shot off south over ridge.;47.4797;-121.7505
