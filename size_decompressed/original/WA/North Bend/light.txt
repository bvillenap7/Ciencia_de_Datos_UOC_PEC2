Bright white-bluish light moving in southwest direction turning into 4.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-11 21:00:00;15-20 seconds;Bright white-bluish light moving in southwest direction turning into 4 This was seen very clearly and was coming from the north, heading in a southwestern direction. What I saw was a very bright light moving, like if it was landing lights on an airliner, it was moving slow but bright, as I started to really look at it, it then started to move faster and started to change from 1 to 2 then 3 and finally 4 bright orbs or light's.  These light's then changed direction from the first and what I would describe as the first or main light, they moved in a downward and away to the right (my right, the left of the main orb) but then they started to move in an upward direction.  Unfortunately from my angle they flew behind a peak of a mountain range that is just north of my location.  I never saw them come out the other side.
