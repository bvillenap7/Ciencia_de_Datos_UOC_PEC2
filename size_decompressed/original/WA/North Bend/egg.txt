Red/White Flashing Craft scene multiple nights in the skies over North Bend, Wa;2012-08-21 20:30:00;2.5 hours;Red/White Flashing Craft scene multiple nights in the skies over North Bend, Wa The following is what I witnessed over the past month or so and specifically August 21, 2012 over the skies of North Bend, Wa: The last week of July I was out and noticed a star that seemed out of place. Upon further inspection and double checking my skyview and google sky to make sure I was not mistaken I noticed it growing brighter and flashing bright white and red light. The following night I went out to see if it was in the same place as I still wanted to rule out anything explainable. It was not. As I turned around to walk back to the house I saw what appeared to be the same thing now over the mountain near me. After watching it hover and then slowly descend behind the mountain I knew it really was a UFO. The following night I went out to look at the mountain at the same time, it was not there of course. This cemented my conviction that it had been the same or similiar type UFO both nights. I tried to capture it with my phone and camera but they were not powerful enough in the dark. Over the next two weeks I found this thing hovering in the sky but in different places nearly every night, just as if it was watching us. Often moving but the movement was so slow you would have to be watching it for a while to notice it. It seemed to be trying to appear as a star, and it would drift just as the sky appears to throughout the night. However, to a person that knows the stars and the night sky it's movement is not as it should be if it really was a star. A week ago I decided I just had to try to get one of these on film so I went out and purchased a new Nikon camera with a telephoto lense. Happily I finally  did a couple nights ago on August 21st as they came up right at dusk. During the past week there appears to be the main craft which is brighter and/or closer to earth along with two like it that seem either smaller or more distant. I did post a youtube video of the the pics I got. They aren't the best but I am going to try to get more. Hopefully I find others who are seeing this craft in the Washington skies as well.
