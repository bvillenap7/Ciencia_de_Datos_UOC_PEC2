I was standing out front of the Snoqualmie Eagles Club in Northbend Washington talking with three of my friends.  We are musicians and had just performed at a birthday party for a family from the area.  We were talking about the meteor shower that was to happen that evening.  Two of us were facing the West looking over a star lit night sky when we both noticed what we thought was a satellite.  It was a very small round speck of light, moving from the North to the South.  My friend took his eye off of the object for a split second and then back on it again. I had my eyes trained on it.  The object stopped and flashed a very large bluish white light, my friend saw the flash of light and then from the spot of the flash it seemed to move at a tremendous speed at about a thirty degree angle away from us and to the Southwest and disappeared.  My friend and I have never seen anything like that in our lives. It was! mind bending.;47.4797;-121.7505
