Bright glowing sphere sighted going into the top of a mountain.;2005-07-04 22:36:00;30 seconds;Bright glowing sphere sighted going into the top of a mountain. I was sitting on a bench with my friend on the fourth of July drinking root beers when a strange light was noticed out of the corner of my eye. We both looked up and saw a sphere with no blinking lights moving slowly toward the top of Mt. Si (our local mountain). The craft moved slower than any airplane I have ever seen. Once it got to the top of the mountian the light flickered, went out, went back on, then shot downward into the mountain.;47.4797;-121.7505
