Lights flashing out of sync. red,blue,green,yellow,white and other colors. Rotated and slowley moved south.+ On April 23 at 1:30am, a friend and I were camping in the woods in snoqualmie washington.I first noticed some lights high above us over and hill and commented that it looked like an airplane. He said it looked more like a helicopter.The clouds were fairly low and it was hard to tell so we forgot about it. A few moments later,we noticed that it was heading our direction. As it came down a hillside, we noticed that it had colors not consistant with regular aircraft.Red,blue,green,white, and yellow (there may have been other colors.) Lights were all over it flashing out of sync with each other. As it broke through the cloud cover, we saw air turbulence behind it. Not as an engine disturbing the clouds, but just as an object moving through it. It came to almost a hover aprox. 75 feet overhead and aprox 60 yards away. It made no sound and did not disturbe the trees it was very close to.Then a group of lights on the bottom rotated to the back and it rotated away from us. We noticed that we could see the color of the lights reflecting off the clouds overhead. The clouds were very low, almost a fog. It then headed south away from us.I have known my friend for 18 years, and he attends Western Washington University. I hesitated to submit this form, because everyone I have told has not believed. I hope that by telling, it will help in some small way.;47.5291;-121.8231
