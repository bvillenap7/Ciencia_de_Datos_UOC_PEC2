Appeared to be flying east from Seattle, going Mach 2+. What was weird was it seemed like a rocket with a long fire trail going extremely fast. It went from full exposiure to nothing in an instance. If it were a falling star, it would go from nothing to something. this was an oppisite event. Maybe 3 seconds later, I say what appeared to be the same object going in a NW direction for maybe 1 sec.;47.5291;-121.8231
