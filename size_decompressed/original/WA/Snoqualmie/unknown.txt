Snoqualmie satelite/ufo;2001-06-03 23:35:00;5 to 15 sec.;Snoqualmie satelite/ufo I observed what I thought was a satelite for a few seconds. It was the size of a small star in the western night sky. All of a sudden it became a bright ball larger than the brightest star in the sky. It seemed to stay that size for s split second when it shot upward in another direction. Could I have observed a satelite burning up?  I doubt that I was the only one to see this. There was also a plane in the northwestern sky at the same time of this sighting. It was going in a northernly direction and made no motion that appeared related to the ufo. ((NUFORC Note:  The description provided by the witness is somewhat consistent with the characteristic flash of an Iridium satellite, but we are not aware that Iridium satellites move in polar orbits.  We will check <www.heavens-above.com> to check for Iridium flashes over this location at this time on this date.  PD));47.5291;-121.8231
