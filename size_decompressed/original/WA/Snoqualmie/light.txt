One white light and two red, flying over Washington neighborhood on fourth of July;2011-07-04 19:30:00;20 minutes;One white light and two red, flying over Washington neighborhood on fourth of July I was outside on my porch with my digital camera, capturing fireworks displays from my neighbors.  I saw two reddish lights flying slowly and horizontally across the sky.  They were not planes.  They made no noise. The lights didnt flash. They moved across the sky very slowly and then vanished one after the other.   Another, single light appeared and did the same thing. This light was white and not red. I filmed both of them.   This is the second time in a month I have seen odd flying objects over my neighborhood.  The first one I havent reported since it was the first time I'd ever seen anything like it and needed to process it.   I will report that one separately from these. I will also email you the video I have. Thanks.;47.5291;-121.8231
Two distinctly separate, bright red-orange star-like, silent objects arced across the sky and seemed to dissipate.;2013-03-08 18:40:00;3 minutes;Two distinctly separate, bright red-orange star-like, silent objects arced across the sky and seemed to dissipate. This observation occurred in Snoqualmie, Washington on the clear evening of March 8, 2013.  Snoqualmie is located at the foot of the North Cascade Mountains.  An object that resembled an unusually bright star appeared in the sky.  It was distinctive in its vivid orange-red color.  It began to slowly, silently arc across the sky.  I then noticed a second, similar object, quite far away from the first, but also moving in the same direction.  Both objects seemed to dissipate as they moved eastward.;47.5291;-121.8231
