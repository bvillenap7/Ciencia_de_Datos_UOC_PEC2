Thought it was a shooting star, went really fast then slowed down.  Weirdest thing. My husband wanted to see the planets lined up and it was the last night for looking, or the second to last night. He thought he saw a shooting star,but then the star slowed down and started coming our way.  Then we thought it was an airplane but it was'nt making any noise.  It flew over our heads, it was bigger then the house when it went over.  no sound what so ever. He got scared because the next minute I'm out there all by myself watching this thing leave.  I ran in and asked how come he left me. He said it was to cold and besides, it must have been an owl. I laugh, because he has finally witnessed something strange that he can't explain.  I always see stuff.  Finally a witness!Helicopter flew around the next couple of days after the sighting.  Never saw so many helicopters in the area before.  I swear some of them looked like they were looking right in my window.  My husband thinks I'm nuts because I'm always having something like this happening to me.  I was so happy to have him with me that night. I checked the first characteristics down below, but my husband saw the light, then it winked out and from then on it was just a dark object.  No sound, that is the weirdest thing to me,  no sound.;48.8645;-122.5953
