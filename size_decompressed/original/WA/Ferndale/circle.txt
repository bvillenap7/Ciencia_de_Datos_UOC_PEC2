Quick white round ball heading in a east to west downward trend;2001-10-15 20:21:00;3 sec;Quick white round ball heading in a east to west downward trend I saw what a bright light fall from the sky .  I was looking south and it traveled in a a East to West direction.  It was white and approx as big as what a street light would appear.  I thought it was close and expected a crash when it hit the ground as thas it was heading down.  Quite fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Event occurred at 20:21::52 hrs.
