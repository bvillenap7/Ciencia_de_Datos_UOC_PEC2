I was sitting on a bench in Pioneer Park and I saw a saucer moving slowly across the sky.  It had a really bright orange light in the middle of it and a orange glow around the saucer.  I was watching it and all of a sudden it shot off into the sky and I could not see it any more.  About 5 mins later it flew over really slow and then shot off again.;48.8645;-122.5953
