Bright white ball traveling at fast speed crosses rural road in evening, 2 witnesses;2011-11-15 20:00:00;3-5 seconds;Bright white ball traveling at fast speed crosses rural road in evening, 2 witnesses Approximately between 8-8:30 pm on Wednesday evening 11/15/11, I was traveling in my car with my 14 year old son.  It was dark our speed was about 30 mph. coming down a hill.  Our location was 48.86 N and -122.64 W (Google map coordinates), in a very rural area with some houses scattered throughout the acreage.  I was on Olson Rd. in Ferndale, just south of Thornton Rd.  A small ball of light flew past our car, coming from the west and going east.  It was below street light level (if there were street lights, which there were not) and was similar looking to a falling star going sideways in front of us, with a slight glow following it.  It was hard to tell the size or the distance from our car and above the landscape.  It may have been 20-40 feet in front of us, moving quite fast and maybe the size of a softball?!   It happened so quickly that it almost didn’t register in my brain.  It didn’t occur to me to stop and watch it either.  After 3 or 4 seconds passed! , I asked my son, Did you just see that?   He said, Yeah. I said, What do you think that was?  He said, I don’t know.   I am posting this now, because I just learned about you and a friend sent me a posting someone made in 2001 that was almost the exact same location and description I experienced.  I may not have ever brought it up with anyone if there had not been another person with me that saw the same thing.  I probably would not have trusted what I saw.;48.8645;-122.5953
