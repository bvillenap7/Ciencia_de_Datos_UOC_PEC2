While walking my dogs, my eye was caught by a strobe flash from a passing plane traveling E to W.  An occasional flash seemed focused (towards me) rather than the non-focused variety usually seen.  The plane seemed to be passing a faint star which then moved in relation to other stars.  Simultaneously, there was a blue flash in the east that lighted up the whole horizon.  I do not believe any of the events were connected, but they may tie to a time line.  I doused my flashlight and watched the N traveling object until it disappeared over the N horizon.  It became more indistinct as it traveled N due to the lights from White Rock, B.C.  It moved rapidly in a zig-zag fashion for a brief period (2-3 seconds) then straightened out in a northerly route.  Could have been a polar route satellite except for the deviations in path.;48.8645;-122.5953

A;2002-09-03 23:00:00;10 seconds;I was watching the Northern Lights last night with my boyfriend.  He was looking at constellations through binoculars when I saw it.  At first we were looking at a red flashing light that was moving pretty fast for an airplane. My boyfriend said that through the binoculars you could tell it was an airplane.  Then, right where I had first seen the red light there was a bright light in the sky. At first it looked like a spotlight, then I notice it was shaped like a thick boomerang.  It was glowing yellowish green, and very bright, I could see it very clearly.  I started yelling to my boyfriend,What is that!. He caught a quick look at it through the binoculars, but didn't spot it until right before it disappeared. It was at least 50-100 times larger than a star.;48.8645;-122.5953
