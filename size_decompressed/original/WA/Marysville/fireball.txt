It appeared so close that she stopped the car to see if there was going to be a fire.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294

Three hovering separately lit objects  east of Marysville Washington;2010-12-04 20:21:00;continuous;Three hovering separately lit objects  east of Marysville Washington Round multi colored flashes of light eminating from these 2, possibly three objects.  They are due east of us, in the north Marysville area.  They are approx. 30-35 degrees above the horizon. one is directly east of us, one a bit north, and one further south.  They do not move at all after 30 minutes of observation, but they all give the same display.  No other stars look even close to the light patterns being given off by these.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
Bright orange object in the northern sky moved and was joined by another similar object both moved away after 3+ visits.;2011-12-31 18:30:00;3+ hours;Bright orange object in the northern sky moved and was joined by another similar object both moved away after 3+ visits. December 31st, 2011   During the early evening hours while standing on our deck at home in Marysville, WA, we observed a distant, bright orange glowing light in the northern sky that seemed to move from right to left across the dark sky.  It would remain in one spot for about 10 minutes then would disappear.  After 3 of these similar episodes over a short period of about 90+ minutes, another was seen to rise and move towards the other similarly colored object in the sky.  Both eventually disappeared as they individually moved away at a distance the made it seems as though they moved away at a fast speed. Our first thought was it was a helicopter hovering, but we could not hear any engine or noise.  It resembled a large object on fire at times. As I am writing this, my wife observed another object with a similar glowing color that moved across the northern sky from right to left, then disappeared after about 10 minutes.  The time now is 8:30pm PST just north Marysville, WA.   I will send 4 .jpg digital photo's from  ((e-mail address deleted));48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294

I was on my bus, heading to my bus stop, when I got to the intersection on Cedar Avenue and 4th Street.  The sky was super cloudy and there was a slight wind.  I had been looking at the clouds when our bus took a right turn onto 4th Street from Cedar Avenue.  I looked out of the left side of the bus, (even though I was on the right.)  Thatâ€™s when I saw a circle in the sky. You might be thinking I am thinking of the sun, but this was a CLEARLY FLAT CIRCLE.  It was red on the outside with slight curls, then a thick layer of green, then a layer of yellow, and finally a mix of orange.  The layers were not neat lines either they were kind of mixed at the edges.  It was just above the clouds, I could tell it was that close.  I could see it through a slight gap in the clouds.  I was the only witness since our bus was moving but a few people saw me as I pointed out the weird thing in the sky.  The time was 3:15 PM it was 4/13/17 and there was MASSIVE clouds over our area.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
