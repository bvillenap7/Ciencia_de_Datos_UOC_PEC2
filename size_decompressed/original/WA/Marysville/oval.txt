We were roasting some chickens on the grill when I spoted something shine in the sky , I ran and got my binocular's. (Bushnell 7x35, 420ft.at1000 yds.,14om at 1000m, field8) I searched and found the object , it hadn't moved it was very shiney and look to be wobbling in the one spot I watched this object for aleast 15 to 30 sec..  I then put my binocular's down to help my husband with the grill and then picked up them up again , when I went to look at it had change shape and looked like a column wobbling in the same spot . I turned to say something to my husband and looked back and it was gone from that spot where I was looking .  I then ran down the stairs to see if I could see it more from the direction to west and high in the sky , it was there for just a moment and it was gone ..  As I was looking at this object for the first time I said to my husband this has no wings so it can't be a airplane and it wasn't a helicopter. I know what they look like and this wasn't it ... All of this happen at about 3:20 or 3:30 pm this 1st day of July , Sunday .  There was no sound coming from this object , but it did look to me as if there was some sort of short beam coming from it in a downwards direction .. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone at length with this witness, and found her to be a serious-minded person.  Her description of how suddenly the object disappeared from her sight, combined with a similar report from Gresham, OR, approximately on hour later, suggests to us that she may have witnessed something unusual.

Bright reddish oval shape with orangish yellow dome;2013-03-17 00:00:00;15 minutes;bright reddish oval shape with orangish yellow dome I was driving home with my six year old stepson, heading south, the crafts were heading north, so two appeared to be heading right for me. I pulled to the shoulder of the road and begin taking video of the two, when suddenly I had a feeling something was above me.  I looked up and a larger one appeared above me. I got a quick shot of it before I jumped in my car because I was frightened.  I'm attaching one still closeup shot taken from the i-phone. I also have video.
