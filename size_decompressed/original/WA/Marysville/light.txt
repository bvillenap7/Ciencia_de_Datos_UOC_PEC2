It was about the size of the moon on a clear night, but this night was partly cloudy. As I watched it it stayed there for a few min. and then seemed to go off into the west and disappear. This was between 9:00-9:30 on the 19 of Feb. 1999. I have know idea what it was that I saw.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294

My wife, daughter, son-in-law and I were sitting in the back yard at 17:30 on the evening of Friday, September 14th.  I was facing north.  I glanced at the northern sky and saw 3 or 4 star like objects.  I told everyone to look up to see what they thought it was.  My daughter said oh, those are stars.  I said, in the daylight? Then looking a little harder, we were seeing more of them all the time.  The most we counted at one time was 14.  They were on the east and west side of the northern sky.  They seemed to be drifting toward the southeast.  They kept moving in all directions, and appeared to get larger and smaller, also.  This went on for about one half of an hour, then they were gone.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
what was this strange light in the sky;2004-07-13 22:00:00;6 min;what was this strange light in the sky My wife called me outside of our home around 10:00 pm on Tuesday 7/13/04 she was watching a light coming from the south and headed north. We watched it for about 7 minutes until it went out of sight. It looked like a star but it didn't have any tracers following it . It was just a bright light like the north star , it was way to high to be an airplane , and it was traveling to slow to be a falling star ., and to fast to be an airplane.  It did not ever fade or blink but at one point it seemed to swerve around for just a brief time then it continued along it's path. I have never seen anything like it . My 19 year old daughter my 11 year old son my daughters 20 year old friend  my 33 year old my and me (43 years old ) all seen what ever this was .we watched it until it was out of sight then we continued to watch for about 45 min. longer and did not see anything else that was like this strange object . We would just like for someone to explain what this thing was.  ((name deleted));48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
multiple lights moving across the sky north to south/southeast;2007-10-16 21:10:00;8 min;multiple lights moving across the sky north to south/southeast The evening became very warm and I went to our deck to check out the sky.  I could see multiple lights moving from north to south/southeast.  Thru binoculars, I could not see any connection or craft between clusters of lights, but they were moving across the sky.

Orange Orb in the eastern skies of Snohomish county;2009-07-16 22:50:00;1 minute;Orange Orb in the eastern skies of Snohomish County An airstrip in Arlington, Wa. is about 5 miles north of the sighting to refer of a small cessna flying over my head after take-off in southbound direction to catch my attention. Being an avid airplane fan I allways look up at the sound of an airplane. When I saw the small plane fly overhead I saw a strange light due east of the plane about 10 miles, at an estimated altitude of 8000-10000ft. Intrigued I watched the light proceed west in the direction of the small plane. I assumed it was a commercial plane on approch to SEA-TAC international. So I continued to track it until it started to flicker behind the trees. So I waited to see if it would continue on it's flight path to the west. It did not reveal itself so I ran to the street for a better view, to find this bright orange light (once the size of a pinky nail, then the size of a small orb) within seconds it had accended to breaking the atmosphere to exit east of the original sighting. At that time, the light shot out some sort of trail ahead of it's direction to exit earths atmosphere. The best way to desciribe it, is a small meteor with a tail but it wasn't coming, it was going, then gone. This whole experience took place within a matter of seconds and I had no time to get a witness or a video recording. So I hope my testimony is enough to explain this very strange happening. For the record, being an avid fan of airplanes, means I know what type of aircraft are in the skies these days including possible (top secret) activity so I know exactly what I see in the sky 100 percent of the time... until now.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
Bright Light - High Flyer moving at very high speed making W shaped turns without slowing.;2009-11-11 18:00:00;35 sec;Bright Light - High Flyer moving at very high speed making W shaped turns without slowing. My wife and I witnessed a bright light moving from SW to NE over the mountains to the east of us from our back yard. I am a 9 year Army Helicopter Crewchief Vet from the Persian gulf and have worked in aviation at Boeing for 15 yrs and grew up working at my cousins airfield so I feel I have been exposed to our capabilities and what we saw is outside of what I would consider possible with our technology. Never in combat nor training have I seen a craft move at this speed with the exception of our own space missions when visible from the ground. . It was approx 3 - 4 miles up moving at about mach 3 or greater. The thing that made me interested and know this was not a fighter nor NASA project was the fact that it started making zigzag's in a continuous perfect W form for about 30 seconds without slowing and then made a 90 degree turn to the east and shot straight up until the light became so small in size it was no longer visible. We heard absolutely no sound but at it's height I did not expect to hear anything.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
6 orange lights south of marysville, Wa.;2011-12-31 01:10:00;15 minutes;6 orange lights south of marysville, Wa. I saw 6 orange colored lights 1 after the other going up not in a straight line and disappearing what I am guessing was a thousand or more feet up.  5 of the 6 went nearly straight up.  Wiggling just a little.  The 1st went up at an eastward angle.  Wind was blowing north. high  Clouds were moving west.

I looked to the east and saw a light which I first thought was a plane but later thought could be a helicopter because it wasn't traveling in a specific direction very fast.  It soon became apparent that it was neither because it didn't have flashing lights like a plane or helicopter.  It sort of pulsed a red orange color.  I thought it was getting closer but I noticed soon after what I thought was a direction of flight was actually just the craft gaining altitude and it went higher and higher and then disappeared.  This object was in our atmosphere and it was close I would say within 10 miles when I first saw it and it went strait out and disappeared.  The strange thing was when I went outside after telling my girlfriend what I saw I saw another one and I called her out and we both witnessed another craft traveling in the exact path as the one before it.  I have been a skeptic my whole life but after what I witnessed tonight I am sure I saw something of an alien nature flying through the sky. It kind of just weaved back and forth as it flew.  It is probably the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed because I thought it was all untrue.  I know this was not a satellite you can track them passing over the earth in a direct line and altitude.  And what I thought was a aircraft traveling through our atmosphere was actually a craft gaining altitude at several thousand feet per second.  Hopefully it happens again I will get it on video.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
Light as bright as a normal star/satellite.  Appeared and disappeared as it travelled northward;2018-05-11 21:58:00;~1 minute;Light as bright as a normal star/satellite. Appeared and disappeared as it travelled northward Witnesses observed an object at high altitude procede from south to north +/- traveling at a speed similar to observed satelites this object appeared to vary its course from left to right and back.  It also went out and came back on as It traveled NW.  Perhaps a meteor skipping off the atmosphere?  There were no other lights on the object.  Thought it was a satellite at first except that it appeared to vary its course left and right and would go out and come back on later on its generally northward trajectory.  It went out at about a 35 degree azimuth to the north and did not reappear.  It originally appeared at about a 20 degree azimuth to the south.  It did not exhibit normal aircraft lighting characteristics.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
Extremely high altitude objects moving fast in tandem in the night sky until one stopped and its light dimmed.;2018-05-23 22:30:00;2 minutes;Extremely high altitude objects moving fast in tandem in the night sky until one stopped and its light dimmed. At nearly 10:30 pm on May 23, 2018, I observed a small, white light, high in the E/NE sky near Marysville, WA.  At first I thought it could be a satellite, (way up there,) but it slowly, gained speed. I then noticed a brighter and much bigger light, in front of the object.  They appeared to be moving in tandem, same heading, (East to North East,) same speed. I was at that time, gauging distance (Are these lights at as high of an altitude as I think?)  Then the two objects passed far above a very high, sparse cloud.  It was then that I was surprised as they gained speed, one following the other.  Their incredible speed was not consistent with my knowledge of military or civilian A/C capability.  Then the trailing object stopped and its light dimmed abruptly.  (I thought that it had disappeared, so my eyes followed the other object.)  The much brighter, larger object continued down the horizon. After following the path of the bigger light with my eyes, I looked back (up) at the area where the smaller object seemed to disappear.  I observed what appeared to be a star but was not the object then brightened and moved off in the same direction as before. I served in the USMC Air-Wing in the 1980's, and I am an avid aeronautics observer.  I have seen many things in the sky that I have brushed off but this was different,  I have no clue what this was or even what it could have been.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
Bright circular light shot past my window in the middle of our woods;2019-10-06 05:07:00;Two seconds;Bright circular light shot past my window in the middle of our woods While sitting on the couch, I glanced up and saw a bright circular light flash past the window about 100 ft away.  For a split second, I thought it was a plane, but it was too close and traveling too fast, and the light was not like an airplane light but like a ball of electricity.  Then I thought it must have been a meteor, but we live in the middle of the woods and I don’t have a clear view of the night sky in the area where this shot past. Whatever it was, it traveled through our woods.  I muted the tv because it was shooting so fast in a downward fashion that I fully expected to hear a crash—but heard no sound at all.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
