Large sphere shaped light swaying and bobbing over the Puget Sound.;2002-11-02 19:55:00;5 minutes;Large sphere shaped light swaying and bobbing over the Puget Sound. At approx. 7:55 pm My Brother-in-law called me outside. There was a super bright red-orange light that seemed to be between 5 - 10 miles to our southwest hovering in the air. It looked about 20 times bigger that an airplane light at the same distance. It was bobbing up and down and swaying east to west. I called my family outside to verify it. It hovered for about 5 minutes, and was spraying down a red vapor that turned to white. It moved slowly to the northwest upwards and then disappeared. At first we thought it could be a flare, but it didn't go down it hung in the air, and the size was way bigger than a flare. (being a boater we have shot off flares in the past) ((NUFORC Note:  2nd report from different witness to the same event.  PD));48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
Red-orange sphere hovering north of Seattle;2009-07-15 22:00:00;3 minutes;Red-orange sphere hovering north of Seattle My uncle lives two blocks from where I live.  I was outside working on my car and he called as he was on his way to work and told me to look up in the sky.  As I looked up, I saw a red-orange sphere hovering above my house. It was lower than any plane.  Living near Boeing, I witness a lot of planes flying over head.  I thought it might have been a stealth fighter jet at first, but then it just hovered and moved slowly south. I ran inside and told my parents to come out and look.  We all stood on the porch and watched the red-orange sphere move south.  It began to ascend into the sky and the light from the craft became smaller and smaller.  It went high into the air until it wasnt visible anymore. It was too dark to get photos on our phones and it was only in the sky for a short time.  I waited around to see if it would come back for about an hour, but no luck.  I was very skeptical of UFO sightings until I just witnessed this craft in the sky.  I have never witnessed anything like it and it was a very eerie feeling.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
Two red fiery objects fly over Marysville, WA multiple witnesses;2011-07-23 00:07:00;3-4 minutes;Two red fiery objects fly over Marysville, WA, multiple Witnesses Upon leaving the Quil Ceda Casino Saturday morning, I witnessed 2 red spherical objects going North to South (and directly over my head before they went straight up) over the Casino at 12:07 AM.  There was no sound coming from the objects. The sky was clear and the visibility was good, the temperature was around 60 degrees F. These objects were low, lower like that of an incoming airplane.  I have seen a number of unknown objects I can't explain, but these objects looked different than the ones I have seen before.  They were red, and silent and the shape wasn't uniform, but more ball like.  And They were an odd shade of red.  They were the largest most brilliant objects in the sky. One appeared larger in size than the other and closer to the ground (1/3 the size of a full moon).  There were two young men standing with me looking up.  I asked one of them what he thought, if he knew what it was.  He gave me the classic I am afraid and I don't know what that is before they both huffed into the casino.   My hands were trembling with excitement and I had a hard time manipulating my new iphone, but managed to take a poor picture of the second object before it went straight up into the sky it was going up and getting smaller.  They had a mechanical non airplane movement, but did move in a straight line before disappearing, and the red color seemed to glow and expand and contract.  I had a hard time focusing my eyes.   Based on the location I would guess these objects to be as big as 737 aircraft.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
