Orange metallic aircraft that distorted photos near Marysville.;2015-01-26 15:25:00;30 minutes;Orange metallic aircraft that distorted photos near Marysville. The aircraft was an orange, metallic, oval shaped cone.  It was hovering near Marysville, and heading toward a mountain.   During the experience the aircraft shined brightly and was now white and harder to see.  It was not in the shape of a plane.  It wasn't a plane because it was hovering and slightly angled itself to go lower than went straight again.   I will still send pictures but I couldn't see the aircraft in the photo and the photos were distorted in some ways.   I was in the car ask it could be a car reflection but I will send it anyways.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
