Satellite does zigzag and conecntric circle course changes, then disappears at high speed.;2005-08-15 21:30:00;several minutes;Satellite does zigzag and conecntric circle course changes, then disappears at high speed. There was a small family get together at my house.  My brother in law stepped onto the back deck to smoke a cigarette.  I went with him, just to talk.  While we were there, I noticed a satellite passing above, and asked him if he had ever seen a satellite.  He said no.  So, I pointed in the direction straight above us and we watched as the satellite moved from north to south and was soon out of sight. He was impressed that he had finally seen a satellite.  I told him there are a lot of them in this area and that another one should be visible within a few minutes.  Sure enough, there came another satellite heading from north to south.  It was not as bright as the first satellite, but we had no trouble seeing it. I handed my automatic adjusting binoculars to my brother in law, while I observed with my regular eyesight.  As we watched it approach slightly south of overhead, it stopped!  Both of us lost track of it within the background of stars.  However, we stayed focused on the general area.  Within about a minute, it moved again, very slowly. We watched as it gained speed to about the normal speed of a satellite.  Then, it stopped abruptly and went into a zigzag direction, east and west.  It repeated this several times, and then went into an expanding circular pattern and repeated that several times. It returned to the zigzag pattern several more times before it resumed a straight line southern direction, picked up speed to something extremely fast, (much faster than the speed of a normal satellite), and disappeared out of view to the south. I have never heard of a satellite that can stop or change direction, and mentioned that to my brother in law.  Whatever it was, the star-like object was flying high enough to reflect the sun’s light like a normal satellite.  We both knew what we had seen, and, both of us had not consumed any alcohol.

While driving my daughter and I saw a batwing shaped large hovering object flying over Marysville, Washington.;2008-12-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;While driving my daughter and I saw a batwing shaped large hovering object flying over Marysville, Washington. It was 10 pm and I was driving with my oldest daughter to my mother’s house in Marysville to pick up my youngest daughter, and all of a sudden we saw a flat surfaced object that was moving north to south. The object was large almost the same length as the moon, all black with a red light in the middle and evenly balanced wings with really bright white lights on each side. It looked like a bat wing. The night was clear with the Milky Way, little dipper, and big dipper in close proximity to each other. The object was diagonally south to the stars.   It hovered closely to the earth, a lot lower than a plane would fly. It looked like it had smoke or a haze following it. It moved up and down and within about 2 minutes it disappeared. I tried to follow it with my car because I couldn’t believe my eyes, I and wanted to make sure of what I was seeing. My daughter kept saying “mom, mom, do you see what I see? That’s huge!” We had never seen anything like it.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
