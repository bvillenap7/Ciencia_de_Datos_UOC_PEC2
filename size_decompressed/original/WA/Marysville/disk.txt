On Saturday evening at 18:00 my wife, two grandchildren and I noticed what looked like a star shining in the sky above our home.  We watched for several min.. After a few min. we noticed a second star.  First thought was they were balloons but they didn't react like balloons.  The objects stayed in the same area for about 45 min..  I started recording with my video camera.  Its hard to tell the exact shape.  Even on a tripod it was difficult to keep a steady shot.  Zooming in as close as I could the object appears to be saucer shape and sort of twinkled.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
