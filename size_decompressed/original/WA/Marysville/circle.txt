On Sunday, January 20, 2008, at 8:50pm in Southern Marysville, Washington , an aircraft appearing to be the shape of a saucer was flying in a northerly direction.  The aircraft had red, white, blue flashing lights moving like a strobe light from different sides intermittently at different angles very fast. First the aircraft moved rapidly, then slowly as it hovered over the area of Jennings Nature Park and the accompanying marshlands in southern Marysville.       The aircraft disappeared going north by 9pm. At 9:02 pm, an unidentified plane which was cruising over the marshlands between Marysville and Everett took a quick flight following the same direction that the aircraft disappeared towards.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
2 unidentified objects above highway 2 in marysville washington;2008-10-01 20:00:00;aprox 30 minutes;2 unidentified objects above highway 2 in marysville washington I was sitting inside my friends truck that was parked in my driveway when I saw what I thought might be the planet mars.  My friend and I were talking when I saw this object.  I looked away to continue the conversation, and when I looked back there was another object of the same size and color right next to the first object.  They were both a hazy red color and circular in shape.  The first object was stationary the whole thirty minutes I was watching, while the second object was clearly moving to the right away from the stationary object.   From the distance I was at it looked like the second object was about 6 inches to the right, when it reached that distance it started to move farther from me.  In about 6 seconds the moving object was out of sight.  The first object was in the same position that it was in when I first noticed it.  As soon as the second object was out of sight I continued my conversation and stopped looking for about 2 to 3 minutes at which time I checked to see if it was still there.  It was no where to be seen.  Neither object left any sort of trail that I could see.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
