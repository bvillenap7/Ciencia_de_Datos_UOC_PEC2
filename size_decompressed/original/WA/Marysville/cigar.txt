Driving to dinner heading west towards State Street in Marysville Washington. My wife noticed to long black objects out to the west over the Tulalip Indian Reservation. Both object long and cylinder in shape stayed fairly even with each other, but were in a vertical position for the first 5 to 8 minutes. After arriving at restaurant my wife preceded inside with my youngest son. I could not take my eyes off the objects along with my oldest son do to the fact they had not seemed to move for a good amount of time. I first thought they were balloons tied together, but a commericial aircraft (DC9 I think) actually flew between the ground and the objects at about 6:40 P.M. This gave a great visual reference to the actual size and altitude of the objects in question. As the aircraft had passed the objects actually changed from a vertical position to a horizontal position and stayed approximately the same distance away from each other. I actually stopped one family coming out of the restaurant to show them but they were not interested at all and looked at me like I was crazy. Two younger men in there early 20's were going in and I stopped them to ask if they also could see the objects and they trying to figure it out also. After about 2 to 3 minutes the object ascended in altitude and then you could no longer make them out do to darkness and altitude of the objects. As the aircraft passed you could tell they were not balloons and were at a much higher altitude then a commericial jet. One thing I cannot believe is that no one else in the city saw these objects and reported them.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
