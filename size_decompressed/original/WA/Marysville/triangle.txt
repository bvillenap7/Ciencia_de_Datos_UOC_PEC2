Young man sees large triangular ship w/ blue & white lights moving slowly in night sky. Streaks off to north.;1995-01-03 18:00:00;2 minutes;Telephoned Report:   At appoximately 1800 hrs., a man, headed east from Marysville and noticed a large triangular object on north side of road moving in a westerly direction.  He stopped his car and tried to follow the object on foot, but it accelerated slightly and he could not keep up with it.   He returned to his car and pursued the object to the west.  The object was totally silent.The object banked to its left, accelerated, and proceded south.  At 2145 hrs., the same observer was westbound from Lake Stevens on the trestle, and witnessed the same, or a similar, object.  He stopped his car and watched the object for approx. 4 minutes.   Finally, the object banked to the left, apparently accelerated, and departed to the west.  Again, no sound was detectable from the observer's vantage point.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
I TOOK ABOUT 30 SECONDS OF WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE EXCELLENT FOOTAGE OF A UFO.;1998-08-20 19:00:00;30 SECONDS;I TOOK ABOUT 30 SECONDS OF WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE EXCELLENT FOOTAGE OF A UFO. ON A CLOUDY AUGUST DAY I TOOK SOME GOOD FOOTAGE OF A CRAFT THE WAS HOVERING AT ABOUT 6000 FEET. THERE WAS ONLY ONE CRAFT. THE CRAFT SEEMED TO BE MORE OF A BOOMERANG SHAPE.I TOOK THE VIDEO WITH A SONY HANDI CAM WITH 72X ZOOM. I HAD THE ZOOM AT 72 WHILE GETTING THE BEST FOOTAGE. EXAMING THE VIDEO THERE SEEMS TO BE LIGHTS ON THE CRAFT. I GOT ABOUT 30 SECONDS OF FOOTAGE THEN THE CRAFT DISSAPERRED IN THE CLOUDS. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IF THIS VIDEO CAN BE CONFIRMED OF EXCELLENT NATURE WHAT KIND OF MONEY WOULD IT BE WORTH.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
low flying unfamiliar object just ahead in the sky;2004-09-16 20:10:00;2 minutes;low flying unfamiliar object just ahead in the sky Traveling South bound on 67th Ave (Armar Rd.) just at 132nd St NE. I noticed a set of white lights (3 to be exact) in the sky, just to the south east of where I was. I was on the cell phone speaking to a friend at the time, and kept her on the phone. I described everything to her as I saw it occur. Watching the road and glancing at it, I was coming closer to it. I noticed that it was stationary over a little farm house next to the road. This is a very dark area at night. And few cars travel it in the night time hours. I only noticed 2 other vehicles in my 9 minute drive from Arlington. Where I had been visiting my sister and Mother for Tea. Still on the phone with my friend, I soon was pretty much coming up underneath of this object. The color was very dark, a green, brown, possibly black color. I tried looking to get more detail, but didnt want to run off this country road.  However I noticed it had wings of a sort, but not positioned like any other plane I had seen before. And it was very disturbing that it had absolutely no sound at all. Scared me...nothing like I have seen before...you go figure? This object was near enough to the ground, I should have seen landing gear if this were a plane.. ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:  In answer to your question, The sighting  was at approximately 8:10 PM.  ((END));48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294

If I had not been looking at exact location, I would never have noticed it, as it was silent.  it was flying low, about as high as a helicopter.  What i could see was 3 dim red/orange lights, forming a triangle in shape, which were changing from a wide triangle to a skinny triangle and back to wide.  It was heading west.  I saw it at approximately 12:15 am.  It was low enough to be sure of what I saw.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294

Triangle-shaped trio of lights in sky disappeared into denser cloud cover;2017-10-22 22:50:00;3 minutes;Triangle shaped trio of lights in sky disappeared into denser cloud cover October 22 2017 at 22:55-ish  Â· I witnessed something funky in the sky tonight. It appeared to be a triangular shaped craft with 3 large white lights.  (These white lights were way larger than typical position marker, lights.)  The white lights were on all three points of the triangle.  One on the leading edge/nose of the craft and one on each other tip of the triangle.  These lights were all flashing in unison at a rate of roughly once every 1 to 1.5 seconds. The clouds were relatively low that night and the craft was just above the cloud line, but only about half to 2/3's high as the traditional aircraft that flew over about 5 minutes later, between approx 23:00 and 23:10.  (Give or take 10 minutes.)  (I had no trouble seeing the red and green position marker lights on the wing tips of the regular airplane, even though it was significantly higher in altitude.)  The sketchy part was that the triangular craft flew into these thicker clouds, and from my vantage point, disappeared as it went behind a large evergreen tree.  After waiting for about 30 seconds, I was astounded that it did NOT come out the other side of the denser clouds, (or the tree.)  I even walked to a different vantage point to change the angle I was viewing from, so that I could see beyond the tallest evergreen, and the craft didn't reappear.  I continued to watch for at least another 10 minutes, but the only other thing I saw was a standard airplane.  Since it was dark, I can't tell you what it was or even how many engines the standard plane had. The fact that the white lights that were flashing, were far larger (at least 10x bigger, and that's accounting for the difference in altitude too,) and flashing much more slowly than the airplane I saw with the red and green position lights. Kind of weird, huh?  Kind of bummed that I didn't get a peek at the craft itself, just the lights in the sky. Oh yes, the of the 3 lines that made up the triangle, the two that met at the nose were equal in length, the trailing edge of the triangle, that line was a little bit longer, making the craft not quite an equilateral triangle, but rather an isosceles triangle.  (Sorry, geometry is not my strong suit, nor are things like judging angles and altitude.  I am hoping that the low cloud cover and the aircraft that flew over afterwards will give you more to go on.)  I did locate an image that looks very similar to what I saw on google images and will send you the link if you would like.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
Very fast rising, brilliant bronze, white, polished aluminum, straight trajectory E, disappearing in far distance and ultra height.;2019-05-20 14:00:00;90 seconds;Very fast rising, brilliant bronze, white, polished aluminum, straight trajectory East, disappearing in far distance and ultra height c Odd, Very Fast Flying, Climbing, flashing Against Sun, Disappearing in Apparent 100,000 Ft+ clouds  During Aprox. 60-90 second Period  From my vantage point on the rise East of Marysville, with view of the South end of Whidbey Island, the ferries crossing between Clinton and Mukilteo and the middle Olympic Mountains West, South-West of Quilcene and Poulsbo, and facing East, the tops of Mt. Pikchuck and beyond, I spotted a very, very fast-rising, very brilliant flashing craft. The sun was high, aprox. at 2 PM.  During the rise, which started above the highest Olympic peak - I see all the highest peaks - I attributed the  flashes to sun reflections as the sky was lightly clouded with mostly wispy, very high cover with widely-scattered denser, small cloud groups to the East. This craft appeared at first to be on a collision trajectory with a large, twin engine Boeing, dusty blue fuselage, white wings apparently on the test range route, North, from Paine Field, at approx. 5000 Ft.  However this craft passed nearly directly above the Boeing plane, perhaps 3 - 7000 Ft higher. It continued in a straight trajectory East, rising very fast, flashing brilliant bronze, blinding white, and polished aluminum, as if a multi, flat-sided, spinning shape reflected sunlight, or its own powerful, pulsed light that apparently covered the entire structure. On an apparent constant straight climb angle, it was entering the group of denser clouds to the East over the Cascades, I estimate 60, 000 Ft+ altitude. Apperaing to pass through lower clouds, as the flashes and now very small-appearing craft disappeared-reappeared between clouds, the flashing and color continued.  At this point I was barely able to discern the craft, except the brilliant flashing continued. However high, it was still on the 35 - 45 degree climb trajectory as it became too small against the moderately blue sky to the East of the clouds it went through. It was happening so fast I didn't think to check my phone for time.  I estimate the E.T. to be aprox. 60 - 90 seconds. Served in the Navy and watching Navy Aircraft, as a speed reference, this craft was not particularly much faster than full throttle fighter planes.  However, I imagine they would be sorely taxed to catch or intercept, or reach ATA strike velocity. The most remarkable feature was the brilliant, multi metallic colored flashing that covered the entire craft every flash. As this event was a weekday and I'm retired, and I figured the very brief elapsed time and trajectory would likely preclude all, if anyone else observing this with a similar vantage,  I didn't search for any place to share my experience.  Therefore, all I recall about the date is mid-May. This morning I checked for any search record of this siting.  This site came up.  I was unaware it exists, and am sharing this now.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
