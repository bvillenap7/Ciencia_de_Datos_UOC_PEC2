A large formation of small pink UFO's.;2014-11-16 13:30:00;15 minutes;A large formation of small pink UFO's. To the West , we saw approximately 50 small UFO's floating.  It could have been balloons, but they appeared to be much too high.   They appeared to be at approx. 15,000 - 20,000 feet and were pink in color, probably from the reflection of the Sun.   They were floating North and in the formation of a type of star constellation.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
Lights grouped together.;2015-07-04 22:40:00;3 minutes;Driving home from Canada on South bound I-5 on the night of July 4th, 2015, myself and my passenger noticed 11-13 red/orange lights grouped together on the West side of I-5.   These object seemed to be suspended in air and just hovering over the area just south of the Marysville exit (again on the west side of I5).   This event went on from the time we drove up and passed the event.  Approximately 2-3 minutes.   One of the lower lights did how ever seem or appear to be moving.

Line of 10 lights 2 red 6 white 2 green, moving across the night sky…  ((anonymous report));2018-09-01 21:20:00;4 minutes;Line of 10 lights 2 red 6 white 2 green, moving across the night sky... My nephew said what is that as he pointed up.  I looked up and observed a straight line of lights heading towards us (north to south) in the sky as a plane would do.  It was moving fast like a plane would.  There was no fuselage.  It was a string of lights in the sky.  I viewed 10 lights in a straight line the first two were red, the next six were white, the last two were green.   As they approach us, over our head they started forming a “J “.  Then they kind of bunched up and continued on but in a scattered line.  I was trying to get anyone in my apartment complex to look up.  I’m a 57 male manufacturing manager.  My nephew is the one who noticed it first. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
