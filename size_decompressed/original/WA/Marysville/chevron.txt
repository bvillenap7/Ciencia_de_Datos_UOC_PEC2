Bright white boomerang shaped object over Marysville, WA;2008-07-11 22:20:00;About 5 minutes;Bright white boomerang shaped object over Marysville, WA My boyfriend and I were traveling along I-5 north from Seattle.  When we were near Marysville I noticed a bright white object the shape of a boomerang behind the trees on the right side of the road (east side).  At first we thought it was a firework, however it was moving up and down, like on a rollercoaster.  It had a tail, and it looked like it was emitting sparks.  We could see it move up and down for about a minute, then it disappeared.  It reappeared a few seconds later and again stayed for a few minutes.  After watching it for about 5 mintues total, it disappeared.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
