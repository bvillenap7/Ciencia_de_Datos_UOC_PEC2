7/85 2030 looking eastward bright silver object hi in atmosphere moved at incredible speed no contrails;1985-07-01 20:30:00;15sec;7/85 2030 looking eastward bright silver object hi in atmosphere moved at incredible speed no contrails I was looking to the east with my back to the sun I looked up from doing yard work into the eastern sky I was noticing how blue the sky was and has I kept looking up at almost75 degrees I noticed a bright silver looking object that was about maybe .5cm in length and slender. I kept looking at it and it began to move towards the south slowly and than it excelarated moving faster than I've ever seen a flying object move within a blink of my eyes it was gone.My eye contact lasted for roughly 15 sec. I knew it wasn't from this planet.It was so high I didn't see any contrails,it seemed on the edge of our atmosphere.I didn't have any mind altering substances in my body I have seen contrails of Boeings hypersonic plane alternating puffs of smoke with length of contrail in between puffs of smoke and this Boeing aircraft was high in the atmosphere and literally dropped from the sky north of Everett. I needed to tell this also.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
I saw a light in the sky that at first acted like a satelite, and then it  did not act like a satelite or anything else I've ever seen!;2003-08-13 22:00:00;2-3 mins;I saw a light in the sky that at first acted like a satelite, and then it  did not act like a satelite or anything else I've ever seen! I went outside, to see if I could see any meteors, as it was around that day when we were supposed to be able to see the meteor showers. Looking up in the sky, towards the east, up , way way up in the sky, I noticed a light moving across the sky. At first I thought it was a satelite, but then it suddenly changed direction, and started heading northeast, moving at a very very fast speed, and there were no flashing lights to be seen like on an airplane. It zipped even faster, and completely disappeared.  I stood there and wondered what the heck I had just seen. When I came back inside I spoke with my aunt on the phone and described what I had seen. She laughed and told me I had just seen my first UFO.  I about fell out of my seat, and sought a place to report it, just in case that was what it really was.;48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294

Observed orange light in night sky no other lights no sound no shape.;2016-03-09 19:05:00;3 minutes;Observed orange light in night sky no other lights no sound no shape. I was leaving my house on my way to work at 7:05 pm and looked up and noticed an orange light coming toward me from the south. I watched it as it got closer and noticed that it did not have any other type of lights on it.  No blinking lights, no green, red, or white lights. This was odd as I had heard that any type of normal aircraft did not have an orange light at all. As it passed over me there was no sound and no shape to it. Just an orange light. I watched it for about another 30 to 40 seconds as it disappeared to the north. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and he sounded to us to be very serious minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));48.0685282352941;-122.168848235294
