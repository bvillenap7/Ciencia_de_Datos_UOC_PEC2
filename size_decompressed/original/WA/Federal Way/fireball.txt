A ball of fire with a tail movng from north to south in the western ski;2001-10-05 07:05:00;10 minutes;A ball of fire with a tail movng from north to south in the western ski It was in the western skies, moving from north to south. A ball of fire with a long tail following it,I assume it was a metor.  But did not see any news reports on it. I pointed it out to one of the passenger.  Probably others heard me and looked also. ((NUFORC Note:  Similar reports and video tapes from other parts of the Seattle area.  They looked to us like contrails behind distant airliners.  PD));47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
Burning Ball in the sky in Federal Way Washington;2013-05-06 23:26:00;23:28;Burning Ball in the sky in Federal Way Washington I was outside smoking a cigarette when I noticed a firey ball appear in the sky. It was spherical in shape and orange in hue.  The object appeared to flash brighter and get very dim until it disappeared.  It was moving in a straightforward advance with no abnormal movement.  At its brightest it could only compare to a raging fire or almost an explosion although there were no clear thrusters or anything that could indicate it was being propelled by this explosive ball in the sky. The duration of the incident was all but two minutes, but as soon as I saw it I called to my girlfriend in the window and she came out to view it as well.  When she came outside that is when the object appeared to get brighter again, then it moved faster as the light just burned out into nothing.  The object did not appear again and we could not see it in the sky in any form any longer.  Also of note, as with any other aircraft I always hear a sound, this object made no sound whatsoever. For me this is my second UFO encounter in the last month and a half.  The first object, although the date escapes me, I saw was bulbous and lightless craft with no sound no wings and what appeared to be windows or possibly lights that were not on.  I have seen many aircraft living in close proximity to an airport and both of these encounters are completely unlike anything I have ever seen before.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
