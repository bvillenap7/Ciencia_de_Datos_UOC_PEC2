I saw the same thing without a telescope. I went out on the deck of my apartments to smoke and we didn't have much of a view but it ws a nice night out with lots of stars but one caught my attention.  I thought it was a satellite because it was moving slowly across the sky   then all the sudden it zig zagged at an unbelievable speed and then it was gone.  Date and time is approx but it was in mid June.  I've only told one person since I saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Zig-zagging star(?) over Seattle.;2004-07-20 00:45:00;30 sec.;Zig-zagging star(?) over Seattle. At approximately 0045 this AM, while taking a break from my patrol duties, I looked up and noticed, what I thought was a bright star... moving. Continuing to watch, I braced myself against my patrol car to get a more stable point of perspective. The object had the brightness of a larger, bright star, when compared to the other stars that were visible, and, using other stars for points of reference, it was, ever-so-slightly zig-zagging, or tumbling as it headed toward the north-northwest. As it jogged about, its brightness remained constant. I watched until it went behind the clouds that were moving in over Seattle. There were no other lights that I could see on the object, and no con-trail. This thing must have been at or above the normal flight altitude that I regularly see airplanes at, and covered about thirty degrees of arc from the time I first noticed it until it went behind the clouds. No aircraft were in the area, which I thought was unusual as well.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
Object with long green trail falling in Puget Sound Area.;2006-08-27 23:00:00;5 sec;Object with long green trail falling in Puget Sound Area. While driving north on Interstate 5, to Seattle, last night at approximately 11pm, my girlfriend and I witnessed an object fall from the sky in the distance.  We were near Federal Way before mile marker 149.  After looking at a map, I would say that the object fell noth / northwest of Federal Way.  As the object fell, it left a long green trail.  I would approximate the color green to that of a stoplight.  Due to the fact that we were driving on the freeway at the time, it was difficult to gauge the distance and location of the object, but I would say it was large and far away.  As there was also air traffic in the area, at first we thought something must have fallen from a plane, but ruled that out, as we both saw it as being much further away than the planes landing at SeaTac Airport.  At first we thought it was just a meteor or a shooting star, however, this object fell in a near vertical path, as we viewed it from the south looking north.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959

Zero Noise.  Flashing lights odd shape. No wings or helicopter blades.;2013-12-04 11:15:00;8 minutes;Zero Noise. Flashing lights odd shape. No wings or helicopter blades. One Object. Black in color with flashing bright lights (Orange and white).  Object drifting from north to south west very slowly at times it would be in one place for along time it seemed.  Lights flashed directly towards the people watching it.  Lights flashed in away that it could not be a reflection.  At times the bottom part of the object would light bright orange.  White light at top would blink/flash in no pattern.  Lower white lights (2) would flash with no pattern.  Orange bright flash on the bottom it wasn't a light it was maybe a beam that it would turn the area below the object glowing orange for a distance hard to say the distance.  The Orange light was very strange looking and in basic hard to explain no noise from object.   Watched it until it started to get smaller in size.  I was freezing cold.  I left seeing the object headed west and getting smaller. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
Small Blue streak of light over I-5.;2018-05-03 16:45:00;2-3 seconds;Small Blue streak of light over I-5. My wife and I were driving north bound on I-5 and a blue object darted out from right to left over the freeway very fast.  Lasted only about 2-3 seconds.   It was heading NW then vanished.  Too fast and small for a helicopter to low for a plane and to fast for a drone.   My wife thought it  was a shooting star, but again, it was too low. If anyone else saw it, please respond.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
I saw a strange red light traveling across the sky, it was star like and it dramatically changed directions, hovered and vanished..;2018-08-10 09:30:00;2-3 minutes;I saw a strange red light traveling across the sky, it was star like and it dramatically changed directions, hovered and vanished.. I was looking out of the window into the sky. I saw a red flashing light traveling across the sky, I thought it was a helicopter or plane at first but the way the red light was flashing/strobing was unusual. He travel across the sky and hovered for a couple seconds, then it curved to the right and hovered for a couple seconds and changed its direction and shot to the left and vanished. I saw what look like the same object again about 10 to 15 minutes later but I wasn't sure, I couldn't tell if it was a plane or not. I do live in a area where I see a lot of planes take off and land but it didn't look like a plane to me but I digress. But I definitely saw this object again about 20 minutes after seeing the first object, it flew over my head and was traveling faster than a plane or helicopter would, it had the red flashing light I saw on the first UFO, and it was star like, it banked to the left and the shape of it appeared to have changed as more lights on it appeared. I can't not say what the shape of this aircraft was because it was do dark and too high up for me to see, I tried looking for it through my telescope and was unable to point to the proper spot for me to see what it looked like. There was no sound coming from this object.  I am always out looking for UFOs and other strange things in the sky's of Washington State and this is by far the strangest things I have seen here so far.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
