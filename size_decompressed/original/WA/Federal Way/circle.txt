Large Round Aircraft seen in Federal Way, Washington Approximately 1976;1976-06-01 04:00:00;1 minute;Large Round Aircraft seen in Federal Way, Washington Approximately 1976 I am now 43 and I was 11 at the time this happened.  I will never forget the event and wish to this day I could draw because I can remember it like it was yesturday. My parents and I were sitting in our living room in Federal Way, Washington on Star Lake Road.  We had a house that had two huge windows.  When out of the blue a very large round object appeared right in front of our windows.  It was about the size of 1/2 of football field.  There were rectangular lights that flashed in a circular motion.  There were to windshields that were the same size as the lights.  It was grey in color and made no noise what so ever.  My dad said  Must be some new boeing project  It just sat there for at least a minute.  My mom said ya right, I have never seen anything that that.  In a instant it shot straight up into the air and took off heading South towards Portland.  We called my aunt and she was like, I see nothing.  The strangest thing of all is the next day at breakfast my parents remembered seeing something but they both said it was a dream.  THen said, how can we all have the same dream.  I try now to talk to my parents about it, my mom is eager to tell it but my dad is dead silent and wont say a word.  I wish I could see it again.

Close sighting, able to see bottom of craft well, hovered for at least 15 minutes just at the top of the poplar trees;1977-07-04 22:00:00;20 minutes;Close sighting, able to see bottom of craft well, hovered for at least 15 minutes just at the top of the poplar trees This was either 1976 or 1977, I can't remember exactly, I was quite young at the time. It was our annual neighborhood 4th of July party at the end of the dead end street. A forested area surrounded the end of the street. I was sitting in a lawn chair watching fireworks down on the street (the neighbors yard was up on a small hill), when I noticed something coming across the sky from the east. I knew it was far too high to be a firework, and the object was getting brighter as it got closer. It was coming what I perceived as slowly, so at first I thought it was some kind of air plane.  I was just surprised at how bright it was getting and close to be a small plane, since it was too close to be a commercial jet.  I don't really remember much sound either, no engine sounds for sure.  When it finally reached us, I saw it was a circular craft.  It hovered right above the poplar trees at the end of the street where we were all gathered!   Amazing, I was really amazed since my father watched Star Trek and being so young I was thinking it was something from the show....I could see the bottom of it, it hovered there with a very quiet sound, a quiet humming but not like any engine I had ever heard(boat,plane,car,tractor, ect).  It had different color lights on the edges on the bottom.  The lights circled around the perimeter of the bottom at equal distances. It hovered there for at least 15 minutes that I can remember.  It was close.  I'm not good at estimating size, but I have a Ford F250 now, and you could fit three of them in the diameter of this craft easily.  The most amazing thing was its departure.  This is when reality hit me that this was not something from TV, even though I was only 6 or 7 years old.  It started to ascend upward, somewhat slowly, but then suddenly it just shot extremely fast straight up above the earth, and became just visible like a small star within just a few seconds, and then I totally lost view of it.  I have never seen or heard of any mechanical thing moving this fast in my life ever since I saw that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Saw an extremely fast white dot (similar to a slow moving satalite but very fast) Zoom across the Puget Sound sky.North to South;1996-11-01 23:00:00;1-2 sec;Saw an extremely fast white dot (similar to a slow moving satalite but very fast) Zoom across the Puget Sound sky.North to South I just saw a cable show of yours and was compelled to explain what I and another person saw back in Winter of 1996. Location- Dumas Bay, Federal WAy, Wa on the Puget Sound. In your show you stated that several witnesses have seen streaking lights moving across the Sound Area. WEll back in 1996 Myself and a freind were looking up at the clear sky at night and I saw a small, possible white dot streak from North to South as fast as one can Imagine. I wasent sure if what I saw was real when my freind said Wow did you see that? I said yes and she said what the heck was that? THe object was not a shooting star, I know because Ive been involved with Astronomy for a long time. It appeared more than anything like a sattelite but amazingly fast. Also, It appeared to move across the sky Rather than coming down from an angle. We were both sure we saw Something that night that was out of this world or Radical technology not known to the public at this time.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
11 of us saw a glowing/orb that went from west to east in about a 3 1/2 minute time frame. I took pictures of it.;2009-07-04 22:00:00;3 1/2 minutes;11 of us saw a glowing/orb that went from west to east in about a 3 1/2 minute time frame. I took pictures of it. Sighting  July 4th 2009  10 p.m. st in about a 3 ½ minute period and moved in our line of vision above the moon and seemed to move more to a northerly direction at that time. 11 adults and 3 children saw this event in the sky 180 degrees up in a 360 degrees total with the full moon present to the right side of the event.  We were watching our fireworks display and the neighbors bigger display and their display was higher in the sky at this time than ours.  We watched their big displays go off and then coming from the left into our view was a glowing round orb moving across the sky from west to east and moving towards the direction of the full moon.  We watched it move smoothly across the night sky and it was lovely.  Reddish/orange ...looking like it was lighted within moving swiftly across.  I began to take pictures when someone said “Look, what IS that?” I watched and saw what I would describe as a fascinating ball of glowing orange/red color moving silently across the sky.  It would be hard to describe the size of the thing from where we were but it looked quite large. It moved from west to east;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959

We were sitting in the backyard around dusk when my husband looked up and noticed the objects flying in the sky.   My son also came out and we all watched as they seemed to form a triangle with one in the center.  They traveled out of view after about 5 minutes.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
