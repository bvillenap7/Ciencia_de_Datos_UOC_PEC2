The shape was a sleightly streached out 55 gallon drum. The size was about as big as a house. It had four legs attached to the mid section. They were wider at the top and tapered down and appeared to be solid. The west end was a bit higher in attitude. It was not safe to pull over so I slowed to observe. I turned onto first avenue, but trees obscured view. I doubled back but could not find it again.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
Cylindrical, or cigar-shaped, bright bronze object with bright orange appendage underneath stationary at 80 degrees in SE-SSE clear b;1999-09-14 16:30:00;30 seconds;Cylindrical, or cigar-shaped, bright bronze object with bright orange appendage underneath stationary at 80 degrees in SE-SSE clear blue sky seen through front windshield of moving automobile heading east between SW Campus Drive and 1st Ave. So. While driving my  car east between SW Campus Drive and 1st Avenue South in Federal Way, I saw a bright bronze, metallic-appearing cylindrical/cigar-shaped object with a bright orange oblong smaller appendage at about 80 degrees above SE-SSE horizon in clear blue sky.  It was seemingly stationary. I saw it for about 30 seconds, but briefly had to keep watching the roadway as well.  Remarkably noticeable, solid-appearing, sharply-outlined and apparently reflecting the sun's rays. The almost flourescent (day-glo) orange, oblong appendage underneath on its left side (or north side) was tight to the body of the object--not loose, or hanging.  I noticed no contrail, movement of any kind, nor saw the apparently reflective, metallic shine change or shift.  There was a stagnant air advisory on the ground at the time, so the wind was negligible, if at all.  I lost it in tall trees along 1st Ave. So., and could not see it about one or two  minutes later near 320th (main drag through Federal Way). The object was about 1/4 to 5/8-inch long at arm's length.  It appeared to be at very high altitude. A very vivid, startling sight and my only UFO sighting since way back in 1967!  I hope someone else saw this...;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
Concentric Cylinders Flat Silver Color with white light;2004-05-15 21:45:00;2 minutes;Concentric Cylinders Flat Silver Color with white light We were driving north on 1-5 and at about Federal Way I saw this huge bright light in the ski that did not appear to be moving.  I was the passenger and I told my friend to look at it.  It was a metal colored cylinder.  It looked like it was 3 cylinders inside if each other.  They were short cylinders and the objects were bigger around then they were tall.  It had a  flat silver metal color.  I don't know how long it lasted as we keep driving.  As we viewed it out the window it just kind of stayed in one place but we kept driving.  I was very clearly a set of round concentric circles. maybe 3 cylinders inside of each other. There is no way it was a plane.  I came here to see if anyone else reported it as there were a lot of cars out and it was close to a populated area.  Others had to of seen this.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
Bright stationary silver cylindrical object seen in clear sky over Federal Way;2006-02-09 15:30:00;2 minutes +;Bright stationary silver cylindrical object seen in clear sky over Federal Way Yesterday, Feb. 9, at about 3:30 PM, I was driving south on Southwest Campus Drive when I spotted a bright sharply-defined silver-colored cylindrical object sitting stationary, apparently at high altitude, towards the southeast, at approximately 70 degrees above horizon.  One end of the object appeared a bit larger than the other.  I watched the object from a stationary position inside the car, after pulling briefly into a center turn lane. The sky was perfectly clear, ground winds were from the North, and gusting (perhaps 20-25 mph).  I watched the object sporadically as I continued driving (in heavy traffic), but then apparently it vanished.  Estimated in sight for two minutes or better. It was about 1/4 in diameter at arm's length.  I've seen many helicopters, small private planes, and commercial and military.  It was markedly different from these conventional craft.  No exhaust smoke or condensation trail. Strangely, in Sept. 1999, I was in the same approximate location when I saw a bronze-colored cylindrical object (with an orange appendage) in a clear blue sky at nearly the same time of day.  It remained stationary, and then apparently vanished.  One other Federal Way resident confirmed the sighting on the NUFORC site.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
