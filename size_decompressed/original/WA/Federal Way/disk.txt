I can’t remember the exact date, but it was between 1977 and 1978, as I was about 5 or 6.  My entire family was in our VW bug, watching a black and white movie (i.e. nothing a young kid wanted to watch, as I remember).  During the movie, the screen went all fuzzy and everyone was honking, then just along the trees above the theater a large object was hovering above us.   As a child, it looked enormous and had lots of lights circling around it and there was no sound of engines or anything.  It was right above us, so there was no mistaking the massive object (i.e. not some small object far in the distance)!   It hovered for about 30 seconds, or so, and then it shot off instantaneously and was gone behind the row of trees.  After it left, the movie came back on clear and was no longer fuzzy. It was sorta like a scene out of the twilight zone, with the effect on the movie screen and all. My mom, dad and older brother all saw the same thing, so I know it wasn’t a kid’s imagination.  Even to this day, and despite being a young kid, the memory is ingrained in my mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Slow speed with no attempt to cloak their presence or any apparant concern of being noticed.;2001-08-01 12:00:00;90 seconds;Slow speed with no attempt to cloak their presence or any apparant concern of being noticed. Weather warm with light cloud cover.  Laying out by the apartment complex pool.  Saw two silver disks (basic, stereotypical craft with a slight dome on top) the size of a quarter held at arm's length flying parallel formation with a quarter sized gap between the two.  No sound. Altitude no more than 3,000 feet.  Clearly defined against the sky traveling southwest through the SeaTac landing/takeoff path over I-5 in the general direction of the Port of Tacoma/Bremerton. The most outstanding aspect was that they were ‘meandering’ at the same speed as a Cessna 172 with absolutely no apparent concern about being seen.  As if they were in their sky and those who saw them should consider them to be an ordinary, mundane event.  There was no indication of how they were propelled, who was inside or where they were going. I have been interested in the topic for over fifty years and my first response was ‘finally I saw some’ not ‘what were those?’  Being familiar with the subject I did a check down eliminating lanterns, floaters, small aircraft or any other object.  Now whenever anyone asks if I thought flying saucers were real, I can answer in the affirmative without any hesitation.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959

We were headed toward the Puget Sound on the one way road at Redondo when I noticed a bright line of light where Maury Island and the Puget Sound met.   I stopped the truck and grabbed my camera.  I took a picture with my Sony DSC 5m.  I looked at the preview of the picture and unfortunatly discarded it.  I snapped another one and upon checking it I turned off the camera and proceeded driving.   Later that night I had my camera out looking at my recent shots and I zoomed in on the white line below the island.  It came out very nice with the zoom and I started inching around the picture looking at things zoomed in.  I was astonished to see the cylinder shape there in the middle of the sky.  We didn't see it at the time I snapped the picture.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
