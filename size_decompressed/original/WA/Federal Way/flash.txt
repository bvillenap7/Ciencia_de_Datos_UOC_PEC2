Camera flash like object;2011-06-04 01:00:00;25 sec;Camera flash like object I just arrived to my parents house and was on the phone talking to my girlfriend.  I was sitting in the parking lot of their house (I talk to loud ) and I have a convertible top and had it down since it was a nice warm night (finally.)    Well, I first saw an object that sort of looked like this Iridium flaring satellite except for the fact that it completely disappeared and the night before I saw the same thing but different position, regardless of the object not more than 5 minutes later in a similar flight path I saw from the corner of my eye a bright flash (like from a camera) and so I focused my attention to the area in the sky and I saw it happen again. It was a very intense flash but no outline of an object nor plane...and it seemed to just flash once every 100yards or so.  While this was happening strange things were happening to my phone.   First my girlfriend cell phone was on mute some how, then soon after I lost signal for approximately ten minutes in a area where I usually get full bars and never an X (usually see x when I am in the back country)   The only thing I could possibly think of which still wouldn't make much sense if there was a spy plane taking photos or something, yet between each flash you could not see any indication of an object up there what so ever and again this flash was very intense...   I would like to find out more or if anyone has encountered anything like this?;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
Bright flash with no sound lighted up backyard.;2016-02-16 00:30:00;2 seconds;Bright flash with no sound lighted up backyard Neighbor next door reports a very bright white flash with no sound, that lighted up her entire backyard approx. 5 cleared acres next to I-5.  At time she thought it was heat lightning but determined that the air temperature was too low.  Neighbor has lived here 60 years and is as sharp as a tack.  I was asleep at the time and did not see or hear anything. ((ADDENDUM TO REPORT)) Addendum to original report Neighbor reports that house lights in three different (but grouped together on five acres) houses went out for 3-5 seconds during flash and then came back on immediately afterwards.  Street lights stayed on. ((END ADDENDUM));47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
