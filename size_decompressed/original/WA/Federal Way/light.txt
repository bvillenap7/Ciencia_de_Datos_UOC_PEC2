This is why I felt the need to report it.  Heading north on I-5 both times around 9:30pm saw a green light off to my left  It was in view for about 3 seconds until the tree tops blocked my  view.  It had a tail but I dont't remember what color it was.  It was traveling west to about north west.   Cannot give a speed but it was traveling fast and stayed in the direction it was heading.   The shape of the object was round.  The second event was about the same but I saw it when I was going down the hill on I-5 north towards south center but the object was heading west not changing direction.   I have lived in Tacoma washington all my life.  I'm 29 yrs. old.  I graduated from Stadium High School.  Worked in monument business for 7 years.  Then went to work for Vitamilk dairy in north seattle.  Member of the Teamsters local 66.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959

One large blue spherical light traveling across the sky in about ten seconds.;2007-03-16 22:00:00;10 seconds;One large blue spherical light traveling across the sky in about ten seconds. This is real, and I donâ€™t know for sure what exactly it is. I was watching t.v. in my living room and something caught my eye from the window. It was a bright blue light, spherical in shape, that traveled westward across the sky in about 10 seconds or less. I was (and still am) extremely puzzled on its nature, for it came with no sound. Looking up into the sky from my standpoint, it was about the size of the top of my thumb.  It moved too slowly and was too large to be a shooting star, and the same for any other form of air travel that I have ever seen. I am a student majoring in biology, and am very science oriented. So I am trying to view the situation with all possible explanations.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
Two lights following each other with a faster then normal speed.;2010-07-03 10:50:00;5 minutes;Two lights following each other with a faster then normal speed. My car was being towed to gregs auto repair my car quit.  The tow truck driver was busy writing me a reciept.  So I looked up at partialy clear sky.  I saw two lights.  One light was leading the way and another right behined following the first.  They were moving kinda fast but not to fast, pretty close also. I knew it was odd so I watched untill they went into a cloud and never came out the other side.  I wanted to tell the tow truck driver but, I could not keep my eyes off these objects.  When it was over and the objects were gone I did tell the the Tow truck driver.  He thought it was an air plane untill I said the lights were following each other with a faster then normal clip.  He thought that was strange.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959

Non-satellite object grows brighter in evening sky and then flies away.;2014-07-31 02:45:00;1 minute;Non-satellite object grows brighter in evening sky and then flies away. I was looking at the night's sky over the Tacoma area and watching what I thought was probably a satellite.  I was watching it traverse the sky and all of a sudden it started getting brighter and brighter. It got brighter to the point that it was like having a flash light shown right in my face. A very fine white light, but extremely bright.  Then, it suddenly changed direction and flew across the sky and out of my view literally within a second. The time was 2:45 a.m. on July 31st 2014.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
