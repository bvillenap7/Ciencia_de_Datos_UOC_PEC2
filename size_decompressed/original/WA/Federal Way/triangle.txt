It was a black triangle with three bright light (looked like there were more on the bottom) We thought it was a plane until we noticed it was moving backward it took two or three turns and then started rising and eventually moved out of sight.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
white lights that resemble the arizona sightings.;2011-04-14 21:39:00;2 minutes;white lights that resemble the arizona sightings. okay so i was on my way to the gym on pac highway with my dad, brother and i. i noticed that there were 3 very noticable lights in the sky and they formed a triangle shape. there were many street lamps in the backround but these lights were white and the street lamps were ornage but the white lights were up in the sky. after 2 minutes another light appeared on the bottom left of the triangle next to one of now 4 lights. same color. we took a left took and got to the gym but our vision was blocked due to trees. after 2 hours we got back outside and these lights had dissapeared. i have no idea what these lights were, not sure if they are ufo,s but these light resembled the ones from the arizona sightings but they were white orbs not orange orbs such as the ones in the arizona sightings annd formed the same shape. another thing is that there is an airport near and there were planes flying in the sky but not during the time of my sightings.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
Triangle hovering low next to highway near SeaTac airport;2019-08-09 00:45:00;5 minutes;Triangle hovering low next to highway near SeaTac airport I was driving southbound on I-5 a few miles south of SeaTac airport on Thursday night (Friday morning), around 12:45AM.  I travel this way several nights a week and always watch the air traffic around SeaTac and McChord Field.   Tonight, I saw an aircraft I first thought was an airliner on the SeaTac glideslope, but it was kind of odd.  It had one bright white light that strobed (like two blinks, pause, two blinks), a solid white light, and a fainter solid red light.  They didn't look particularly unusual for aircraft lights, just in a configuration I've never noticed before.  I can't even say that description of the lights is completely accurate - I was driving, and assuming it was just an airplane, not paying that close attention - but something along those lines. After a few minutes, I realized it wasn't an airliner, it was hovering at a few hundred feet just west of the highway.  I assumed it was a helicopter.  I glanced up at it as I passed, and nope, it was a perfect dark grey or black triangle, with the lights at the tips.  I'd say it was hovering at maybe 200-300ft and maybe about 40ft on a side, and I didn't notice any noise. I wasn't able to stop or go back, but I watched it in my rear-view mirror and it didn't seem to move much, if at all.  I drove around a bend out of sight after maybe half a minute. Even at 00:45, I-5 close to SeaTac is a fairly busy highway.  There should be plenty of other witnesses, if anyone bothered to look up.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
