I was driving southbound on I-5 with my 8 yr. old daughter, just past the Federal Way truck scales, when I noticed an unusual light that appeared to hover over the freeway median at about 75-100 ft.  As I traveled closer to it I saw a round white light in the center of the object and a silver sphere on either side.  I could barely see that these were fixed to an oval-shaped structure that was just longer than the width of the median.  I could not get my daughter's attention to look at the object. This did not look like an airplane or helicopter.  The round light was approximately 5 ft. in diameter, as were the silver spheres.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
Witnesses see six green glowing egg shaped objects overhead flying east followed by a flashing blue saucer!!;2003-08-17 00:30:00;3 Minutes;Witnesses see six green glowing egg shaped objects overhead flying east followed by a flashing blue saucer!! It was 12:30 AM this morning.  My brother was going home after he visited me and my family for the day.  I saw him to his car and talked to him for a couple of minutes.  We were then distracted by green lights overhead.  The vehicles were about 100 feet high.  These objects were moving east at a velocity of 10 mph.  There were six of these objects and were all traveling together.  Some of these objects were moving erratically left and right but were all staying pretty much in formation.  Two teenager ran towards us from the left in excitement screaming what the hell are those!!?!  My brother and I did not say anything for abut twenty seconds as we were in awe.  I then told them that they looked like green glowing eggs, and one of the kids said, they are definitely not airplanes, not helicopters, their not even making any noise.  A blonde girl around 22 joined us and began watching them as well.  She was speechless.  Then a car pulled up and a 30 year old woman asked what we were looking at, we said we have no idea.  Six green egg shaped objects just flew over our heads and you can still see them right next to the tree on the left.  She said, *I See them, and her son said I see them too!!!!  We stood there for another 3 or 4 minutes until they just disappeared.  Ten minutes later, my brother and I saw another object fly quickly over our heads but this one was flashing a blue light.  We saw its outline as it passed overhead between us and the white cumulus clouds above.  The object was black and shaped like a disk with a very bright blue flashing light underneath.  It continued towards the east for about 400 meters then made a sharp left turn and disappeared.  That is all I can say, that is what we perceived.  Can you tell me what it was?  Did the air force pick up anything on radar at this time?  Let me know!  Thank You ((name deleted));47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
