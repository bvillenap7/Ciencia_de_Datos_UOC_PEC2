Summer evening silver sphere;1974-07-11 22:00:00;5 seconds;Summer evening silver sphere I was with my father he was holding my hand to go tell my brothers it was time to come in because it was getting late..  I remember my dad gripping my hand and we stopped . A round silver sphere came straight down from the sky , made no sound hovered directly in front of my face and shot straight up into the sky. My dad grabbed me yelled to the boys to hurry he then turned and basically ran with me in his arms.  I just watched history channel Ancient Aliens when they spoke about Jerry Betz’s sphere and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing it is the exact same thing that I saw.. so I had to contact the UFO center.;47.3171853658537;-122.339295934959
