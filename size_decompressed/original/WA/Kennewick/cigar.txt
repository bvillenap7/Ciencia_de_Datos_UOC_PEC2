Sky opens, objects darts out, then disappears through another opening in the sky.;1993-08-20 19:00:00;1-2sec;Sky opens, objects darts out, then disappears through another opening in the sky. If you can, imagine this part of the sky opens, a metallic cigar shaped object darts out, stops, then exits at a tremendous speed through a opening in the sky across from it, disappearing. Thats the best way to explain it. It happened so fast that if my crewman and I hadn't been looking we would have missed it completly. We had just completed work on a light on the snake river and were traveling by boat to the boat ramp behind one of the dams (I can't remember which one) it was just the two of us on the river and we were trying to reach the ramp before it got to dark. We both looked up to our 10 o'clock posn at about posn angle 30 degrees and this object appeared. I can't say with any certainty the distance or how big the object was, but it was close enough to see that it was dark gray and elongated (like a fat short cigar). We just looked at each other and said, What the heck was that?. The trip back to Kennewick we tossed around ideas as to what it might be but ultimately failed to come up with anything. It was like the thing opened a hole in the sky, entered our realm, paused, then left through another opening. There were no lights, no sound, no trailing vapor, no other aircraft, nothing. In fact if I hadn't been looking right at it I would have dismissed it altogether. Sky conditions were clear, visibility was 10nm, seas were calm. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

White cigar shaped object seen moving from east to west;2013-08-21 14:15:00;1 minute;White cigar shaped object seen moving from east to west Looked up and saw a white Cigar shaped craft, moving in the sky.  I thought it was a plane, but it had no wings or tail or engines.  Just a White cylindrical object moving from east to west. Level flight.  After watching for a bit, I remembered my phone and filmed it, but I only got it for about 2 sec, then it went into the clouds, or behind, or in front as it blended with the white clouds.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
