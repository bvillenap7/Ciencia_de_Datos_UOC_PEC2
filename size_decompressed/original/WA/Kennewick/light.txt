Huge circular orbs of flaming red light flew above the river right in front of me one night while I was camping.;1977-10-15 23:00:00;5 minutes;Huge circular orbs of flaming red light flew above the river right in front of me one night while I was camping. In October of 1977 I was camping along the Snake River at Hood Park which is right outside of Pasco, Washington. My companion and I had been in town visiting friends that evening and since we were both driving our own vehicles, I headed back to the campsite in my own car ahead of him. When I got to the campsite, our two dogs were frantic because their ropes were all tangled around each other and they wanted to be loose, so I walked over to where they were tied up and set them free. I grabbed some soap and a washcloth from the tent and started walking towards a water faucet that was about 40 yards from our tent. The dogs started racing around me in endless circles which I thought was strange because they were extremely excited and unusually rambuncious, but I just figured in that moment that they were just glad that I had gotten home to set them free. However, they were annoying me because they were getting in my way and I yelled at them to go play somewhere else and they took off in a flash. At that point I looked to my right towards the river and up to the sky. It was a brilliantly clear night, no moon, with lots of shining stars all around. As soon as I looked towards the sky, I stopped dead in my tracks because I was staring at two huge orbs of light that were silently cruising right above the river in front of me. They were not very high in the sky at all and were flying right above the river, about as high as a crop duster plane might fly if it was getting ready to position itself for the next pass over a field. I knew immediately that they were not of this world and I dropped to my knees. My mind started racing.....I was not afraid.....in fact, I began to mentally send my thoughts skyward with a million questions......who are you? Where are you from? What are you doing here? Are you who I think you are? and so on and so forth. These orbs of light were as big and as round as a full moon can sometimes look as it is rising low upon the horizon. I'm talking huge here. They were definitley orbs of light, but as I stared at them I could see a slight outline behind the light that looked to me like an H shape, an H that was laying flat and flying. The light itself did not look like the kind of light that we are accustomed to. In other words, the light did not have a neon or artificial kind of quality to it. It seemed to have a life and energy of it's own. In fact, it reminded me of a burning coal....it had the same qualities and color and glow of a burning ember. The orbs of light also sparkled around the outer edges, similar to how a diamond sparkles when hit by rays of light, and they were exceedingly beautiful. So beautiful that my mind was overwhelmed by the greatness of their beauty and I just kept saying mentally you are so beautiful!!! These orbs of light (or celestial vehicles as I like to call them) were moving very slowly above the water, one in front of the other at exactly the same height in the sky. They made no sound, no sound at all. In fact, I was stunned at how quiet it was. They just flew by, right in front of my eyes, and then slowly made a 90 degree turn and headed towards the town of Pasco, the direction of which was going away from me, not towards me. As they continued to move away from me and away from the river, the orbs of light appeared to become one, but that was because one was right in front of the other and they were at the exact same height in the sky. At this point I was feeling extremely disappointed that they were leaving me behind because they had allowed me to see that they existed and I wanted to know much more about who and what they were. My mind began to cry out to them saying please don't leave me now that you have allowed me to see that you exist!....and then I started to pray, and I said to God, please Father, if these orbs of light are in some way connected to you, please give me a sign. Amazingly, as that thought and prayer left my mind, the two orbs of light, in unison, suddenly sprang into action and zipped through the night sky in an exact movement that left red tracers in the sky in the shape of a huge triangle. I burst into laughter at that point and said to God Oh Father!!! Is is too much for this tiny doubting soul to ask to see that one more time? and in immediate response to that request, the orbs of light zipped through the night sky again and left the red tracers of a huge triangle in the sky. At that point, they disappeared from view, and I rose up from my knees and started walking back towards my tent, but I swear to you that I did not feel the ground under my feet! I felt like I was walking on air. My companion had just gotten back to our campsite and his back was to me as I walked towards him, but he did not hear my approach, which I thought was strange since the night was quie! t and th ere were leaves all over the ground that should have been crunching as I walked, but even I did not hear the sound of my own footsteps. I walked right up to my companion and tapped him on his shoulder, and as he turned around, quite startled, I found myself trying to tell him what I had just witnessed, but my voice was barely a whisper as I felt as if I was under some kind of magical spell that I did not want to break. Unfortunately, my companion did not believe my story, and his disbelief made me decide to keep this experience to myself and I did not tell anyone about this event for another 10 years. I have only told my closest family members and friends about this and I admit, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would probably have a hard time accepting it as fact. But fact it was and is and even though I cannot prove that this ever happened, I know what I saw and experienced. This was not a vision or a hallucination.....this was a physical manifestation of something beyond this world and it was decidely celestial in origin. Since then I have continued to watch the night sky and have seen quite a bit of activity way up there where the satellites roam, but some of what I've seen leads me to question whether or not it's all just satellite action up there as I have seen 3 to 4 white lights flying side by side going in various directions a number of times. I believe that we are not alone and it remains to be seen how this is all going to turn out. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell my story. I've been carrying it around for a really long time. Take care and God bless....;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887

Saw same event yesterday 1/1/00 at western direction at approx 9 pm On 1/1/00 (approximately 9:00 pm)saw a bright light at a 45 degree angle from the ground.  Then it fizzeled out.  Conditions in atmosphere were clear.  Object went too fast to be a plane too large to be a meteorite.  Object was white in appearance. On 1/2/00 (approximately 7:34 pm)saw same object at a northerly 45 degree angle from the ground.  Object went straight down towards the ground and proceeded to zig zag and then continued straight down.  Conditions were clear.  Witnessed by my girlfriend and I.  Within minutes after the event the sky was filled with 3 objects obviously airplanes heading in a westerly direction with very minimal space between them.  Possibly military. We currently live 10 miles outsite the Hanford Nuclear Reservation which covers 450 square miles.  So if object was picked up on radar military aircraft would have been scrambled to verify object.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
Two objects viewed in the night sky moved at a very high rate of speed from instant stop to a very fast new direction.;2000-12-17 20:17:00;1 minute;Two objects viewed in the night sky moved at a very high rate of speed from instant stop to a very fast new direction. I, witnessed two rounded objects of a orange-pink color move around each other from stop to stop, left to right, up and down over a very large area of sky. This occured in the South East portion of the sky. These two objects moved at an incredable speed over a very large area of the sky and both did not have running lights on them like a normal aircraft would. What attracted me most, was the way they moved about. No airplane nor helicopter could ever move about like this. I took ground school and have done some flying to know better. I, am an ex-military Aviation Ordnanceman as well as an Electrical Engineer. The law of physics does not apply to the two objects viewed tonight. As I, ran for the camcorder to return and video these two objects, they were gone.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
Silent, orange ball of light seen crossing the night sky in Kennewick, WA.;2001-07-04 00:00:00;~ 1 minute;Silent, orange ball of light seen crossing the night sky in Kennewick, WA. I was looking out my window towards the north and  noticed a bright orange light appearing to be rising from several miles away, as it broke over the shadow. The object was first thought to be a large firework, but the object did not explode, nor did it stop rising after several  seconds. I then thought that it might be an airplane taking off, as the airport is in that general direction.  The object then appeared to stop rising and track horizontally and southward after it had risen approximately three finger widths at arms length.  At that point, the odd nature of the object instilled curiosity and a desire for further investigation.  I went outside, and through my binocularts tracked the object as it approached me at somewhat an obliwue angle.  My binocular power setting was high at first, and revealed what appeared to be two orange lights seperated by a small distance.  My hands were shakey, and at that power things were hard to focus, so my thought was that it was an airplane with wing-tipped landing/takeoff lights.  However, it struck me that the object was making no sound and the typical red and green marker lights were not seen. I then reduced the power on the binoculars, making it much easier to focus the object, and the thing I saw revealed itself.  The object had a large central orange ball of light, in which a smaller orange ball of light circled at approximately one orbit per second.  Several seconds later orange debree was seen falling from the object, and slowly fading in color, as though it were cooling, and disapperaed prior to reaching the level of the trees and houses across the way.  It was then that I thought the object might be burning material caught on an updraft and prevailing winds, but there were not winds sufficient enough to move the object across the sky as fast as it was travelling, nor did the object's shape and characteristic change after the falling debree.  I continued to track the object for several more seconds until it just vanished.  Through the entire incident no sound was heard, and no other color was seen other than the orange of the two balls of light.  Whether it was one object or two is not known to me.  I wonder if others have seen this same object and can confirm what I observed.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887

At 21:19 hours, a single small white light viewed in the southern portion of the sky, traveled from the N.W. towards the S.E. portion of the sky at elevation plus thirty degrees from the right of MARS maintaining 30 degrees until reaching due south and then slowly fading out,like a lantern out of fuel. This lasted for about one minute. The sky was clear with calm winds. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed, but satellites do fade from view as they course to the east.

Bright lights in eastern sky.;2009-09-08 21:25:00;10 seconds;Bright lights in eastern sky. Very bright white lights, brighter and larger than any other lights or stars in the sky. Moving together in a row, one behind the other, in the eastern sky.  They were moving too fast to be a plane or satellite that I have seen.  Lights were not flashing, too close for commercial flights, too far away to be one aircraft.  No vapor trail and no noise.  Lights shot up at tremendous speed distorting the lights into red streaks and disappearing.   Red streaks were not like a meteors or shooting stars.  These lights also again, shot straight up and out, very fast after moving very fast across the sky.  The white light appeared to distort and stretch like warp drive on star trek when shooting up and out.  The red streaks appeared motionless for a second before disappearing.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887

I just happened to be looking out at the sky when I observed 3 large white orbs stacked vertically in a tight formation.  They were travelling east to west at a very high rate of speed.  The lights were round and bright white in color. When I first saw them I was looking northeast and watched as they crossed in front of me, now looking north and watched as they headed northwest, disappearing out of sight looking west. I live in Kennewick, along the river, and from my viewpoint the angle of height was approximately 30 degrees.  From my viewpoint, looking east, where I first saw it, to looking west, where they disappeared.  Horizontally, the angle was approximately 100 degrees of view.  It took approximately 10 seconds from the time they first came into view until the time they disappeared.  I noted that the bright white lights never blinked like an aircraft would.  Nor were there any jet engine sounds. These objects appeared to be close to where my house is and appeared to be following the Columbia River at a low altitude and a very high rate of speed.  My view was unobstructed. I certify this to be true and correct under penalty of perjury.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
A very bright dot of moving red light, then a flash like an explosion far up in the western sky.;2011-08-02 00:26:00;1 minute;A very bright dot of moving red light, then a flash like an explosion far up in the western sky. Very far up, to the west, as high or higher than an airplane flies, was a very small and very bright red dot of light.  It was not flashing but was a steady light, moving very slowly.  It disappeared, perhaps behind a cloud.   I waited to to see it come out from behind the wispy cloud but it did not.  Instead, in the same general area, there was a flash of light as if something had exploded.  It, too, then vanished.   I am a 67 year-old writer with an AA degree.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
A continuous string of 20 to 30 fast blinking multi-colored lights that vanished after five minutes.;2011-09-19 20:30:00;5 minutes;A continuous string of 20 to 30 fast blinking multi-colored lights that vanished after five minutes. On Sept. 19, at about 8:30 pm, I saw a continuous string of quickly blinking lights in the western sky. These lights, consisting of  red, green, blue, yellow, and white, were all compacted closely together with no visible spaces between them. These lights, consisting of about twenty to thirty in number, did not blink in any pattern but each seemed to be flashing on and off independently. This craft was very slowly rising in a west by north-west direction. I watched it for about five minutes. As I was almost convinced it was some kind of airplane the craft either suddenly turned off all of its lights or, without making any sudden or quick movement, vanished. There were no clouds that it could have escaped into. Since that incident I have spent several hours on the Internet researching any known aircraft that contains this same configuration of  lights and found nothing even remotely that the craft resembled. No sound could be heard from the craft. Even at the! hight the craft was an airplane at the same could have been heard.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
White Fluorescent object movig extremely fast in multiple 90 deg turns due East of Kennewick WA.;2011-10-25 09:52:00;8 sec;White Fluorescent object movig extremely fast in multiple 90 deg turns due East of Kennewick, WA. I was driving eastbound on Hwy240 in Kennewick Wa. on my way to work (only here for two weeks on a business trip).  I was looking in the sky a little bit south east of the road because the moon was in an almost perfect crecent.   As I looked into the sky an object appeared just a bit to the lower right of the moon. (At this time in the morning it wasn't really dark out).  The object was like a fluorescent light in the sky (Extremely bright and white).  The shape wasn't very clear but the raident light kinda gave it a Seattle Space Needle outline look.  At first I was excited thinking that I was seeing a shooting star or some kind of satellite falling through the atmoshere.  But was intrigued that it had very little light trail (like a meter etc).  What happened next, will be remembered by me for the rest of my life.  It stopped and it took a 90 deg angle back the other way.  Then stopped again.  It then took another 90 deg across the sky, stopped once again and ! then shot directly outward almost as if it shot straight to the right of the moon and dissapeared. I've seen my share of air shows and military jets perform..etc.  I've never seen anything this fast nor maneuver the way that this object did.  The thing I most remember, is when it stopped and turned back the other direction, I remember telling myself to clear my mind and focus on what I was seeing.  I did so, and remember my hair standing up on the back of my neck.  This was a great experience for me ans will never be forgotten.  I'm an engineer, a video gamer, an athlete, a dog owner, an uncle, a brother..etc  ...  But definetly not a nut job.  I saw what I saw (alien craft, meteor, new military plane) whatever it was..and have no problem explaining to anyone.  But, like most it seems, my sighting was short and now is gone.  I keep replaying the scene in my head so that I don't forget the specifics and most importantly so that I don't skew any of the facts.  As I want to remember as accurate as possible forever. (we've all played the telep! hone gam e).  Thank you and good luck with this info. P. S.--The main reason I'm sending this in, is that a guy from my work referred you, Doug Dunlap.  He said he is a friend of yours.  I also mainly submitted this, to see if anyone else had seen what I saw.  There were plenty of other people on the highway at the same time as me.  I asked a fellow co worker on the Hwy just moments after me if he had noticed the crecent moon, and he replied oh yes definetly.  I kew he would because the size of the moon and the perfect shape was right over the highway and was a great view.  With the fact that the moon was hard to miss and everyone was most likely looking into the sky near it as I was, there had to be more people that saw this object as well.  I would love to know I wasn't the only one!!  Thank you for your time;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887

Reddish orange triangular pattern of lights.;2015-01-02 21:00:00;3 minutes;reddish orange triangular pattern of lights. At approximately 9:00 pm on January 2, 2015, I stepped out on my back porch to have a cigarette.  In the south eastern sky I saw a triangular pattern of lights.  The lights were reddish orange in color the brightest of the lights was at the top point of the triangle.   The two bottom points of the triangle were slightly dimmer.  There were dimmer lights along the connecting points of the triangle.   It took me a minute to comprehend what I was seeing, it was amazing.  As the lights were getting dimmer, I shouted to my sister in the house to hurry and come see this.   When I first saw this triangle there were approximately 10 lights.  By the time my sister saw them, there were only about 5, with the brighter points of the triangle still visible.   All of the lights got dimmer and faded away, some of the lights veered off from the triangular pattern.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
