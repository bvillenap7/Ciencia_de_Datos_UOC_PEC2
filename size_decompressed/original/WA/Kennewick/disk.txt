It was followed about 30 seconds apart form 6 other objects of light.   As they each got by the moom, one by one they turned a light yellow.  They traveled in front of the moon one at a time.  They were oval shaped and very black in color.  As they got passed the moon I could clearly see with my eyes very large and black disk shaped objects travel towards the hill.  The last ball of light that appeared in the sky was very bright red, then turned orange.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887

I saw them one at a time about 30 seconds apart turn a light yellow and disappear as they got to the moon.  Then they passed in fornt of the moon one by one and turn to a black large disk. They covered half the moon in passing.  I then went to get my binoculars and camera.  Me and 3 other people saw them as very black circular objects traveling through the sky, viisable to the eye.  Through the binoculars i saw a very large disk traveling towards Hermiston Oregon.  The last object i saw appeard left to the moon.  It was very bright red, and did the same as the others, but did a little zig zag motion. After it passed the moon, I looked through the binoculars again and was very amazed at how large and somewhat slow motion it was traveling.  The black disks were very visiable.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
