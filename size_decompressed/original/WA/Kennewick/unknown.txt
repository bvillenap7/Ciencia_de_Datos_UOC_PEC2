White lights moving sharply over the Kennewick sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2006-10-23 01:15:00;1 hour;White lights moving sharply over the Kennewick sky. I was looking up at the eastern sky at 0115am, and I noticed a light that was making sharp turns and moves.   I watched this light for about 15minutes then realized that there were about 8 other lights that were doing the same thing.   I then noticed a group of lights just to the south of them that were lateral, and were slowly moving horizontal.  I thought I was just still half asleep, but then realized I had been watching them for an hour.  I was going to get a camera or a camcoder, but I was hesitant to do so and never did.   To me it was erie and gave me a bad feeling.   Did anyone else see these lights??? ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
