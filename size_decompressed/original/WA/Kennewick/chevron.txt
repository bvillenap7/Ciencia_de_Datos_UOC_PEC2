We were in the hot tub, listening to dreamland and watching the stars.  It came zooming across somewhat in the northeast sky and heading east.  It had a faint orange light and was a crescent shape.  (My husband says he saw a light, but I don't remember that.)  I estimate the visual size as being about an inch across at arm's length.  (long arms)  The speed was much less than a shooting star, but much faster than any airplane.  There was no sound and no sonic boom of any kind.  This appeared sometime close to 8:15 or 8:20 Pacific Daylight Time.  So fast, my goodness.  Also, the object gave me the impression of flowing through water.  Like the stars seemed distorted by it.  Can't really describe very well.  That's about it.  Thanks.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
13 sightings of large, fast moving, silent, triangular/V-shaped objects/bright lights since March 2014;2014-10-03 23:25:00;Seconds;13 sightings of large, fast moving, silent, triangular/V-shaped objects/bright lights since March 2014 I have been seeing large, fast moving, silent, dark/transparent triangular, V-shaped objects and bright lights in the sky on clear nights since March of this year (13 sightings through October 3rd.  The sightings have become more and more frequent.  I am starting to see two on the same night.  I have entered only my latest above because the form only accommodates one sighting.   Here is my log:  I reported the first one I saw this year to MUFON (case #55584).  I saw it in the early morning hours of March 7.  I did not send the report until April because it took me that long to work through it in my head.  I had a similar sighting several years prior at my previous home ten miles to the east of my present location but did not know where to report it.  I have been keeping a log of the sightings since March (dates, time, shape and direction of travel) and just found your site.  Last night I saw two within 3 minute of each other and want to see if anyone else is reporting the same activity.  My husband saw one in August and is convinced that they are military drones. Here is my log.  Please note that each of sightings are silent, high altitude, and fast. By fast, I mean seconds to cross the sky.  March 7, 2014 12:45am – 1:15 am (Original report to MUFON case # 55584) I was facing south on a clear night with no moon, looking to the southeast when a very large, high altitude vessel blocked my view of the stars.  If I had not been looking where I was, I don’t think I would have seen it.  It was dark, no visible lights and almost seemed transparent or as if it was reflecting the starlight, almost invisible.  It was a large, triangular/boomerang shape that had rounded corners and the back was indented (not a typical straight lined triangle, but not a typical boomerang either).  It was completely silent and was moving faster than the high altitude planes I see all the time.  It passed just slightly to the east of me, moving south to north.  July 16, 2014 10:33 pm Very fast, dark, silent, V-shape moving W to E.  I could only see the leading edge of the UFO as if it was reflecting starlight.  I could not see rest of it.  August 3, 2014 10:10 pm Very fast, dark, silent, V-shape moving W to E. Again,  I could only see the leading edge of the UFO.  September 1, 2014 12:15am Very fast, dark, silent, V-shape moving S to N.  I could only see the leading edge.  September 3, 2014 10:54 pm 2 fast moving bright lights moving very close together coming from the SE to the NW split very wide apart in an outward motion but continued to travel at the same speed in the same direction until they were out of sight.  September 4, 2014 11:30 pm A bright flash in the same SE location as the lights seen the night before (Sep 4, 2014).  September 21, 2014 2:32 am Steady light traveling E to W about ¾ the speed of a shooting star.  Did not change speed, intensity, or direction.  September 21, 2014 10:19 pm 7 dim lights in very fast, dark, silent, V-shape moving NW to SE  September 25, 2014 11:34 pm Bright lights (1 or 2) moving very fast, E to W.  Did not change speed, intensity or direction.  *September 30, 2014 9:34pm and 9:43pm Faint V-shapes moving slower than previous sightings.  I could only see the leading edges.  The first at 9:34 was N to S.  The second at 9:43 was angled slightly NW to SE.  October 3, 2014 11:25pm and 11:28pm V-shape with 7-9 dim lights on front edge fast moving NE to SW.  I could only see the leading edges.  The second at 11:28, direction was angled slightly more WNW to SE but was a straight line angled SE to NW, not v-shaped.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
