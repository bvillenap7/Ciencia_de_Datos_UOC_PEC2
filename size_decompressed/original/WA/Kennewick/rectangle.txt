Rectangular object with four pulsing red lights at the corners, moving slowing and silently;2006-03-09 21:25:00;10min;Rectangular object with four pulsing red lights at the corners, moving slowing and silently Object had four lights in rectangular formation, two on top two on bottom. Also two small flashing lights near the front, one on top of the other.    Object moved from southeast to northwest at a slow pace.  There was no sound.  I thought it may have been a plane or helicopter equiped with lights to advertise something at first but there was no sound and it was pretty close.  About 1000 in the air, and 9-10 blocks to the east of me.  Two lights in the front flashed white, they were stacked one on top and one on bottom.  The Four red lights pulsed slowly, fading out and comming back on.  It did not fit any aircaft to which I am famillar because of the configuration of the lights and their pulsing nature.  The shape was rectangular or Square like a four cornered box flying across the sky. The craft was low and did not head in the direction of the airport in pasco but kept moving northwest.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887

Wife and I were driving to appointment at 10:00 am, when she noticed a rectangle object just floating in the sky (looked white and silver).   After few minutes it started to travel north west very slowly getting faster and faster.   Seen all black helicopter chasing it.   The object stopped suddenly letting the blacked out helicopter get somewhat close, then took off so fast it was instantly gone.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
