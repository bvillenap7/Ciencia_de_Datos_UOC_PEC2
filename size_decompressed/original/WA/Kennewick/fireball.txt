Three round orange objects traveliing in a row from north to south;2000-11-28 21:00:00;30min;Three round orange objects traveliing in a row from north to south Three fireballs or bright balls in a row seperated by about 1 minute flying north to south.  I look at one of them far off with my digital camera (no film) on the zoom and two of us saw it spining with some orange and dark spots.  But since they were far off and difficult to hold the camera still on the zoom it was hard to get a more precise description.  My guess is falling satillite that broke up into three pieces but I would like to know what it was.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
On the night of August 24th at 3:00 A.M. I observed to huge stationary fireballs in the sky over Kennewick, WA., to the east.;2010-08-14 03:00:00;10 seconds;On the night of August 24th at 3:00 A.M. I observed to huge stationary fireballs in the sky over Kennewick, WA., to the east. On the night of Aug. 13/14, at about 3:00 AM, from my back porch, I observed two huge brigt yellow fireballs low in the sky to the east. They were silent and holding still. They were placed one directly above the other and very close to each other. They were brighter than anything I have ever seen. I would estimate that they appeared to be some thousand times larger than Venus as she rises. I glanced away for a mere second to check what my dog was doing.  I then looked back to where the fireballs were but they were gone. I am a retired, educated person, and the author of one of the history books about Kennewick.  I also have over 600 historical articles publeshed at various websites on the Internet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A fireball, half the size of the sun and covered by a thin cloud, appeared in the eastern sky.;2010-08-27 07:00:00;2 minutes;A fireball, half the size of the sun and covered by a thin cloud, appeared in the eastern sky. I saw, halfway up in the eastern sky, a huge fireball.  It appeared to be half the size of the sun. However, a small thin cloud covered it which created a hazy appearance. I watched it for about two minutes. It suddenly disappeared and so did the cloud. At first I thought it was the sun, then realized the sun should be higher up in the sky.  After moving a few steps I could then see the sun as well.  The sun was higher than the fireball and to the left of it.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
3 large silent, slow moving fiery orbs moving across the sky in an arc, one after the other in a timely manner.;2016-07-13 21:50:00;10 minutes;3 large silent, slow moving fiery orbs moving across the sky in an arc, one after the other in a timely manner. 9:50 PM  After coming home from a walk, the two of us noticed an object in the sky.  There were 3 large, fireball-like orbs smoothly traveling their own curved routes, one after the other.  They were a bright, rich orange, colored and glowing like fire.  The first moved towards us, then turned in path and continued to the left of us (North), dimming increasingly but maintaining its size, pulsating, and controlled demeanor. About 3 minutes after we first spotted it, right as we were struggling to keep track of it in the distance, the second appeared from the same place the first had in the sky.  It seemed to move slightly closer towards us, turned at the same point as the first, and followed in the same direction but in a tighter arc. When what seemed to be the exact same amount of time in between the first and second sightings had passed, and it was just getting out of sight, the third appeared.  After turning, this one made the widest arc and came closest to us by doing so. Despite standing in the middle of a parking lot, staring up at the sky, commenting, and recording the encounter, it was as if all pedestrian traffic resumed minutes after the third had passed, and the one person who did walk right by us in the middle of the event didnâ€™t seem to notice either us or the sky.  There were no clouds and stars were out.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
