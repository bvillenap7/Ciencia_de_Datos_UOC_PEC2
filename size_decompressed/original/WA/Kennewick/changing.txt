Multi-colored liquid looking balls coming from a ball of light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of twinkling star??  PD));2009-04-20 21:00:00;2 hours;Multi-colored liquid looking balls coming from a ball of light. April 20, 2009 8:00PM  9:30PM Kennewick, Washington UFO sighting Still Photographs taken. In the back of our house looking at the stars I noticed a twinkling object west of our location. My husband went to get our camera, which had a telephoto lens. I looked through the lens, and saw red, green, and white lights twinkling. We decided it was not a star. It was not on top of a tower or a hill. It was not traveling (moving) like a plane. It was too bright to be a helicopter. We did determine after sitting in the same spot for about 12 minutes that the twinkling light was moving NW as it had drifted from our reference point between two trees  We grabbed our tri-pod, got in our vehicle, and headed in the general direction of this twinkling light. We decided it was above West Richland, Washington or Benton City, Washington. We went to the Union St. Library in Kennewick, which is about 3 miles or so west of our home. We got out of our car, walked to the darkest part of the field, set up the tri-pod, and began to snap photographs. The light changed shape. The light made perfect cylindrical clouds that were red, white and green in color. We snapped two photographs where it appears there is a HUGE unidentified (by us) flying object. Like to know what THAT is! In many of the photographs, there is what seems to be a multi-colored tail coming from the light. The light began to drift very quickly at the end heading in the direction of Yakima Washington. We focused the camera on light from a house at one point to show the object was moving, and changing shape. This can all be seen VERY CLEARLY from the still photos. There are also the stars to use as a reference. My husband and I would like to know what we were looking at. Yeah, we would really like to know. Will someone please IDENTIFY this UNIDENTIFIED flying object so we can sink back into our safety zone? We are not stupid so please make it something we can grasp with certainty. If you tell us they are hereâ€¦.we will understand.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887

As they passed infront of the moon, they blocked out half of the moon.   The last one was bright red and did zig zag motion once.  As I got binoculars, I clearly saw a very large circle shaped object black object.  The black objects were very visible without binoculars.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
