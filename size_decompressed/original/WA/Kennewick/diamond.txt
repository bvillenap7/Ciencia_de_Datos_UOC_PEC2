Six objects lighting one by one,then leaving from north to south as one.;1998-03-12 01:40:00;2-3 mins.;Six objects lighting one by one,then leaving from north to south as one. On march 12th at approx. 1:40 I stepped outside to check on my dog,something had upset him. While I was out I thought I could possably get a look at the commet. After observing the commet for a brief moment I turned a little to the north. I saw what looked to be a group of dim stars,at that moment they began to light up one at a time.I then called for my cousin to step outside and take a look. As he steped out all six lights left at once headed due south. All six objects were the same shape and moved as if they were all connected.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
