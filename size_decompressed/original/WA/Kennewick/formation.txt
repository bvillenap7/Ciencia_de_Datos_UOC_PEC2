At approximately 12:26 am pacific time, I stepped outside my home to check that my garage door had been closed before I went to bed.   I turned to step back inside and I noticed three bright orange lights in a triangle formation to the West.  I thought it was peculiar they were not moving very fast at all and seemed to be hovering (we have many aircraft flying over head to and from the commercial airport, but these lights were different).  Then after only a few seconds of observing them, it appeared that they began to rotate on one axis, then on another but remaining in triangular form and distance from each other.    As they began to rotate in unison, two other large orange lights emerged in my view, following closely behind and in the path of the first three lights.  I could now see five lights. I then ran inside, got my wife out of bed, and she then confirmed she could see what I was seeing.  She witnessed the three lights in triangular formation, and the two lights following closely behind.   I ran back inside, and woke up my visiting parents so they could also observe.  The four of us watched as the three lights in triangular formation separated from formation and slowly rose in altitude in to the clouds illuminated by their light.  As they rose we began to lose sight of them, two additional lights came in to view, and began to follow the first set of two lights.   All lights were moving in the same general path, rising in altitude above the clouds and out of view. Yes it was early New Years day - No, we were not under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
