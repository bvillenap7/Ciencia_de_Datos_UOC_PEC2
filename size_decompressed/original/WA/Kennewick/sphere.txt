two sightings/ #1 orange earthlights follow each other & #2 massive silver ball moves at high altitude across sky;1999-06-14 19:00:00;5 minutes;two sightings/ #1 orange earthlights follow each other & #2 massive silver ball moves at high altitude across sky I have had two really strange events happen to me.  I remember the events VIVIDELY and thou time has passed I feel I need to informe you.  I love the Art Bell shows when you are a guest. I first wrote this to an expert on EARTHLIGHTS and included the moon size ball story also.  I feel that it is well described and hope that you don't feel slighted because I am sending it on to your organization. FEEL FREE TO PASS IT ON TO ANY OTHER experts.  The BIG SILVER BALL insident was at approximately 7 to 8 pm on June 14, 1998 or 1999 ( I remember that it was about 2 days after my birthday- but I can't remember the exact year ).  I wish this could help maybe you received another report of this nature about June 14 or 15.  Maybe you could forward this to Art Bell and Coast to Coast as well.  Thank You and keep looking up ( I THINK IF MORE PEOPLE KEPT THEIR EYES TO THE SKIES< UFO SIGHTINGS WOULD BE EVEN MORE COMMON ).     >Subject: earthlight sighting and seperate massive silver ball sighting (high altitude)  >sighting #1 - Two beautiful silent orange lights >Hi, I live in Kennewick, Wa ( where the Columbia and Snake River Join >together).  This is also 30 miles from the Hanford Atomic Energy site that >produced the Plutonium used in Japan.  The coolant water from the reactors >passes directly below my home, one mile away (I mention the reactors only because I wonder if they are sometimes associated with sightings).

AT THIS TIME I WAS REALLY AMAZED AND THRILLED TO SEE ANOTHER silent ORANGE BALL OF LIGHT FOLLOW THE SAME IDENTICAL PATH AS IT'S PREDICESSOR. I NEVER MOVED AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE PATH WAS IDENTICAL >WITH THE 90 DEGREE TURN INCLUDED.    AFTER THE SECOND LIGHT HAD MADE IT'S >TURN IT FOLLOWED THE LEADING LIGHT BY 200-300 YARDS.  I continued to watch >the lights go to my right ( as if following highway 395 to Umatilla,Oregon) the event took at least 5 minutes and the second light blinked out but >the front light grew fainter as it continued South.  IN AFTERTHOUGHT I FELT >SO BAD THAT I HADN'T ATTEMPTED TO FOLLOW IT .  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU >FEEL THIS IS AN EARTHLIGHT SIGHTING OR UFO SIGHTING.  THIS EVENT WAS FROM >TWO YEARS AGO AND I REMEMBER IT LIKE YESTERDAY. sighting #2                                                From my yard I also saw, while watering my roses in the afternoon light, a perfectly round silver BALL it looked like a basketball up in the air high enough to be just the size of the moon in the sky.  I thought this thing may be close to me but as it moved to the east it passed in BACK of the WAVY little Cirrus Clouds that are close to 30,000 feet in altitude ( yes, I am bright enough that I thought of testing its hight with CLOUDS). Again no sound.  I DID NOT THINK IT WAS A WEATHER BALLOON/ EVEN IF ONE COULD SURVIVE BEING INFLATED TO THAT PERFECT ROUNDNESS. TO HAVE APPEARED >THAT LARGE AT 35,000 feet it would have had to be huge. Bigger than a Boeing 747 because when watched from the ground a boeing 747 does not appear to be the size of the moon until it is much lower, say 5000 feet or less.  To approach that much pressure the high altitude weather balloons would be much closer to 25 miles above the earth anyway and would not even be visible). Again I could have followed the object but did not. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Dates are approximate.  PD));46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
Standing outside saying goodby to family members and pointing to Chem-Trails;1999-10-10 12:40:00;45 secs;Standing outside saying goodby to family members and pointing to Chem-Trails My wife and I were outside our homes saying goodby to our daughter and son-inlaw, as we were watching them drive away, I showed my wife all the Chem-Trails that were in the sky including 4 planes flying overhead and spraying at that moment. I saw a round glowing object that I thought was a bright star at that moment but realized that it was only 40 minutes past noon and stars don't shine that bright in the daytime so I countinued to watch it to see what I could see. It was simply setting there in the sky over top of all the Chem-trails. I showed it to my wife as our kids pulled pack into the driveway as they forgot some things. I looked at them and then immediatly back to the object and the object was GONE.. I am guessing at arms leanth it was about the size of an ink pen point. But was very shiny as though the sun was shinning and reflecting off from it.  I know what I saw and it was not a star, nor was it one of the planes as this object was totaly setting there and not moving other then a small rocking motion.  It appeared to me as if it was simply setting there and watching all the planes spraying these chemicals all around, as the chem-trail are massive here today with approximately 30 to 40 of them at any one time floating down.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
5 silver/white/gold spheres over Kennewick, Washington;2006-08-15 13:30:00;10 minutes;5 silver/white/gold spheres over Kennewick, Washington Five (5) silver/white/gold shiny spheres slowly moving across the sky.  At first I thought they were balloons because they resembled those shiny baloons people buy for parties and they were going very slow across the sky like a balloon would float.  It wasn't until they lined up in a row and then shortly after created a v shape that I thought otherwise.  We watched them for at least 10 minutes they would go far away and then come back all the while shifting there positions from close together to far apart to lined up into different configurations.  It was weird! I really don't know what they were, but it peaked my curiosity! I don't believe in UFO's, but I don't know what the heck they were.  Thought the UFO community might be able to make sense of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
Silent Red pulsing sphere moved from the south toward us then moved west until view was blocked by a structure after two minutes.;2020-05-17 21:53:00;2 minutes;Silent Red pulsing sphere moved from the south toward us then moved west until view was blocked by a structure after two minutes. On Sunday May 17, 2020 at 9:53 pm, I saw a red sphere in the sky.  It was silent, and the red sphere light seemed to pulse.   It moved westerly and my visual ended when it went below the roofline of the shop in my neighbors’ backyard.  Initially I thought it was the planet Mars, just particularly brilliant.  But when I realized it was not stationary, I snapped a quick photo and then returned to the house to get my husband.  We both returned to the backyard and it was moving and seemed closer to us and moved westerly.  It appeared to have a whitish haze around the sphere that emanated about two times as wide (also circular habit seemed dimmer on the upper left side) as the red pulsing sphere and the aura lasted only a few seconds, then it returned to a solid pulsing red color (my husband saw it pulsing red and blue). I’m not even sure if I would call it solid.  It soon was starting to go behind the large silver maple tree in my neighbors’ backyard so I walked! about 40 feet south so I could continue to keep a visual on it.  I was able to capture several short videos on my iPhone and then it appeared to turn southerly and seemed to be moving away from us moving in a southwest direction and downward rather quickly.  This whole experience lasted  from  9:53-9:54 (21:53-21:54) before it moved out of my sight because a structure was blocking my view.  I believe it was about 50° off the ground when I initially saw it and when I lost sight of it, it was about 25° off the ground.  It appeared to be a bit larger than Mars is to the naked eye and I approximate it did appear to get a bit larger as it moved across the sky.  There were few clouds in the sky mostly toward the north (none in the area that the object traveled) and there was no wind.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
