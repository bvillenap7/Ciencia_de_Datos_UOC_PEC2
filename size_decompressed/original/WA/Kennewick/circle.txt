The object was as big a full moon in the sky. I was driving in Kennewick, Washington around 9:00-9:15pm and was heading east on Clearwater Ave. I was approaching Columbia Center Blvd. and saw a huge object in the sky. The object was round and looked like a giant fire ball. The object was bright red with fire coming off of the surface. I saw this fireball in the south eastern part of the sky and it seemed bigger than the moon in the sky that night(which was only a partial crescent moon). I would say it was as big as a full moon when comparing it to the objects in the sky. It definitely was the largest, unidentified object I have ever seen in my life. It was so large I expected to feel some type of impact after it disapeared beyond the outline of the buildings(which were in my way, so I could not see it land or crash).;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
Three bright, orange  objects moving across the sky.;2010-12-31 22:45:00;30 Min;Three bright, orange  objects moving across the sky. At 10 45 P.M on 12/31/10 I was standing outside with 3 friends.  As we were looking into the sky, I saw three extremely bright objects moving at a rapid pace across the sky.  I mentioned it to my other friends and we werenâ€™t sure what it was.  The three objects were at least 3 times brighter than any other star in the sky.  The objects moved in sync for the first few minutes but then started moving at random, seeming to weave in and out of flight pattern.  Two of the objects headed in an easterly direction while one stopped and hovered for 3 minutes.  The single object that hovered then took off in a southerly direction and faded out.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
Two objects chasing each other around night sky;2020-04-11 21:30:00;5 seconds;Two objects chasing each other around night sky Two star like objects quickly zipping across the sky. At first, they appeared to look like two shooting stars with no tails but they continue for several seconds.  They appeared to be chasing each other.  They quickly changed directions and almost disappeared but they then reappeared again, zipped around and finally were out of site.  Moments later a flashing light from the same vicinity flashed several times (5 seconds between flashes).  We thought maybe they were an airplane light but they didn't change locations. It flashed about 5 times and stopped. I am not an active follower of this page but wanted to report this as it was a peculiar incident.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
Military aircraft escorting glowing orb south of Kennewick, Washington.;2020-07-23 21:30:00;2 minutes;Military aircraft escorting glowing orb south of Kennewick Washington. My wife and I observed a military aircraft escorting a glowing orb south of Kennewick, ,Washington on a date and time given.  The military aircraft was following behind the object and continued the escort until it was out of sight.  It approached us from the south from the direction of the Boardman bombing Range in Oregon and headed in a north easterly direction.  The aircraft had clearly visible aircraft navigation lighting.  The glowing orb that it was escorting had no such lighting.  I am fairly certain it was a military aircraft because I could not find it on my phone app that tracks commercial aircraft.  Typically, military aircraft do not show up.  However, commercial aviation and general aviation aircraft do show up on that app.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
