Bright  flashing lights moving through night sky;2008-06-13 00:00:00;2 minutes;Bright  flashing lights moving through night sky A friend and I were walking to car around midnight in Kennewick Wa. when I noticed a VERY bright strobe light in the sky to which was so bright I was certain it was not an aircraft almost immediately.  Within seconds I realized the flashing was either rotating or coming from both ends and that the flashing was not consistent like the strobe on an aircraft.  There was no  lights or a strobe that would associate it with being an airplane and the way it was moving, very erradic, slow then fast, up , down, this was just not the way any aircraft that I am aware of can or would fly.  The brightness of these flashing lights would be comparable to what would be seen from arc welding at a distance.   We watched this for about 2 minutes and then it disappeared.  We were facing northwest which would have put whatever it was above the Hanford Nuclear Reservation or very close to it.  The sky was clear and there was considerable amount of moonlight.   If you can imagine what it would look like to see the bright flashing light that has NO consistency from several LARGE scaled arc welders flying through the night sky, that is what we were seeing.  This was NOT the strobe light from any aircraft, the way it was moving was unlike anything either one of us has ever seen and to recall this event has me goosebumped from head to toe.  I would really like to hear from others that must have seen this as there is no way you could have missed it.  Please inform me if there is any other reports of this.
