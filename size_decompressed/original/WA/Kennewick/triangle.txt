When;2000-11-02 21:30:00;15 minutes;Two objects which appeared to be very low and triangular with white light. They were spread apart and traveled from left to right. When I got the camera and zoomed in I could see red and greem lighted flickering triangle. The right one flickered and then just disappeared after about 10 minutes. The other one stayed another 5 minuntes or so and went above me and then just disappeared. There were no clouds or wind and they made absoultedly no noise. My daughter came running in and calling for her mom to come look. One of the kids said he saw them at first as two wheels connected .;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
Observed traingular object with dim off-white lights on underside of each corner. Traveled with no sound at all.;2001-06-01 22:04:00;Approx. 8 Sec.;Observed traingular object with dim off-white lights on underside of each corner. Traveled with no sound at all. Observed object traveling north to south from my front step. I was facing east when I saw the object. It caught my eye at about my 10 o'clock position (east/west axis) 1 o'clock (north/south axis). It continued South, to about my 2 o'clock position, where it faded in the haze.  I observed the object for approximately 8 seconds. My view was blocked for about 1 second by a tree in my yard. The object traveled at a steady rate of speed and appeared not to veer from its southern course. I could not determine its altitude. There was no sound during or after the object passed over my location. The object was the shape of an equilateral triangle, dark in color (slightly darker than the night sky), with what appeared to be dim off-white lights under each corner facing downward. The lights on each corner reminded me of the new round LED brake lights used on trucks and buses. The lights were steady in brightness and did not flicker or pulse. After the oject had passed, I wondered why an aircraft would have such lights mounted on the underside. Maybe they weren't lights. Perhaps this was the visible effects of propulsion.....I don't know. As a size reference, after the sighting, I cut out a Â½-triangle from a piece of paper. Holding the triangle at arm length gave a good size aspect of the object.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
Black Triangle  no sound  unbelievable speed.;2004-08-14 23:00:00;15 seconds;Black Triangle  no sound  unbelievable speed. My wife and i were watching a meteor shower in august 2004 when an object in triangle shape flew in no sound.it had 3 dim lights at what seem to be underneath tip of each point. we knew somthing was there as it past it blocked out the star light. As we watched the thing  i sat up and object seemed to have realized we were watching, as in a second it shot from what seemed to be 1000 ft above us to maybe 20,000 ft in an instant. My wife got scared and ran into the house, i stayed out the next two hours hoping to see it again. I was amazed the object made no sound. I am currently working with a friend that has some good night cameras. will contact if we see anything again. Thanks for all the reports. I read several reports almost identical to ours inspired me to report this event.   regards  ((name deleted));46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
triangle ufo with red lights on each end, round edges, carnival ride noise;2007-07-01 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;triangle ufo with red lights on each end, round edges, carnival ride noise I forgot the exact date, it's somewhere around the end of June 2007 and start of July 2007. I was over at my cousins house and it was around 9-10 p.m. when I was swimming in his pool. I started to hear a whooshing noise, kinda like a carnival ride. When I turned to where the noise was coming from I saw a big triangle shaped object hovering over the trailers. That's when I ran inside my cousin's trailer and called him out. By the time he came out the UFO was over his house. It was about 400 feet over his house and had red lights on each end, with round edges. We watched it for a couple seconds and it went away behind a tree, we didn't see it after that. It was a grayish black color. We called our parents out when I called my cousin, but they didn't want to see it because they thought we were lying and were watching TV. Me and my cousin never told anybody but our friends and family. Nobody believes us except for my brother. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Huge black triangle with 3-4 lights on the sides floating above my house.;2021-02-28 08:20:00;15 seconds;Huge black triangle with 3-4 lights on the sides floating above my house. I was on getting out of my car when I had a feeling to look up in the sky, I looked up and noticed an object I have never seen before. It was a huge black triangle with 3-4  lights on the side of the craft. It was moving very slow, I didn't take my eyes off of it but told my brother who was with me to get out of the car, as soon as I said that it started moving faster and disappeared. Like invisible , I could not follow it with my eyes anymore. I saw it for about 15 seconds, I should have recorded it butt I was astonished I was looking at a UFO. It was the size of a house just floating there. There was no way it was any aircraft I have ever seen. I will attach a picture that I drew immediately after I saw it.;46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
