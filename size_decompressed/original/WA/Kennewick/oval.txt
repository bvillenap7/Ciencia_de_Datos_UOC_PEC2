Object appeared in the early morning sky, was seen by more than one person, and affected the power in the immediate area.;2013-01-23 07:15:00;30 seconds;Object appeared in the early morning sky, was seen by more than one person, and affected the power in the immediate area. Witnesses were standing on a street in East Kennewick, at the noted date and time. Suddenly, the power went out for several city blocks. They looked up, and spotted a large oval shaped object, larger than the Sun in appearance, moving slowly across the city in a NE direction, toward the Columbia River. The object made no noise, nor did it lose any debris no unusual scents or animal movement known. After approximately 30 seconds, the object disappeared from sight. As to the craft itself, it was dark orange in the center, turning lighter shades toward its outer edges. Those edges were not clearly defined, but, rather, appeared blurry and may have pulsated. There were no ill effects on any witnesses, local media did not respond to my report of this event. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the father of the youthful witnesses, and we were impressed by the apparent sincerity of the witnesses.  We have encouraged the witnesses to contact the press, in order to try to find other witnesses.  PD));46.2247294023491;-119.17118537887
Orange color oval with light on top and many lights on the bottom very distant through a telescope.;2016-08-11 20:30:00;43 minutes;Orange color oval with light on top and many lights on the bottom very distant through a telescope. UFO report of sighting 8-11-16.   The purpose of this report is to identify objects that I have seen through my telescope, and not to claim a sighting of extraterrestrial aircraft. On August 11, 2016, at 8:10 pm I observed a bright spot in the sky with my naked eye that was obviously not a star as the stars were not visible this early in the evening.  After a few minutes I realized what I was seeing was not something I have seen before so I shot a picture and a short video with my cell phone and got my wife to come outside to have a look also. Using a 7x35 binocular I was able to resolve the object into a disc shape but no other detail was visible.  I set up my C-8 Celestron telescope to have a better look.  The object resolved into an orange color object that was oval shape, had a flashing light on top, was rimmed with what appeared to be many lights around the circumference of the bottom side that were dimmer than the light on top, and seemed translucent like a fabric. After a few minutes of observing, I attached a video camera to the telescope and recorded a few minutes of video in two recordings.  After bumping my telescope I was not able to find the object again as it was getting farther away and dimmer during the observation. The video capture settings, frame rate at .844 per sec. is to slow to stop movement so there is some motion blur in the images but enough detail to see structure of the object.  The orange color had faded to whitish purple by the time I got the video recording.  I do not see the lights that were around the bottom of the object in the video image that I saw through the eyepiece of the telescope. The sighting lasted from 8:10 pm to 8:53 pm about 43 minutes until I lost sight of it.  The direction of travel was southeast, and the object got smaller by about half and was viewed by me and my wife, before I went to video capture. My telescope was hastily set up and there were no stars to polar align the mount so the tracking is off a little with respect to the stars.  The tracking motor is running at sidereal rate and I used the manual slow motion controls to center the object when it ran out of the field of view.  I have been using this telescope for 18 years and this camera for only a few times.  I am experienced with deep sky astrophotography with several camera types and several telescope types for 17 years. Technical information:  Telescope, Celestron C-8 telescope, 200mm mirror f/10 with f/3.3 focal reducer.  Calculated focal length 686 mm. Camera, ZWO ASI 120 MC color video camera with 3.5 x 3.5 micron pixels, 1280x960 image size. Capture at .844 frames per second.  All technical data is available.  Approximately 420 frames of data available with object visible.  Two video files 903 MB and 893 MB.  Three still captures from video.
