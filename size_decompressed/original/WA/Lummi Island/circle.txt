Stationary moon like object near lummi Island ferry terminal.;2007-09-29 21:30:00;several hours?;Stationary moon like object near lummi Island ferry terminal. I observed and photographed a very strange object near the Lummi Island ferry landing.  It appeared perfectly circular, seemed to be stationary and emitted a soft fluorescent like light.   The size was nearly that of a full moon and seemed to be no more than several hundred yards distant.  The weather was clear and there was no confusing the object with the actual moon.   I managed to shoot one photograph with a sturdy tripod and excellent telephoto lens using high speed color negative film.  In the photo the object appears to have a double lobed oblong core surrounded, by an orange tinged halo.;48.7154;-122.6777
