Two groups of lights in formation;1999-12-01 20:00:00;about 5 minutes;Two groups of lights in formation Triangle One: Three white lights in a horizontal equilateral triangle about half the width of the moon. Point of triangle facing direction of travel. One red light in center of triangle.  Triangle Two: Same as first triangle except it had a cluster of blue lights instead of one red light. Blue lights seemed to be scattered throughout a spherical area in the center of the triangle. The blue lights repeatedly flashed in the same seemingly random sequence with a momentary hesitation between cycles. Length of cycle was about two seconds.  Distance between triangles was about the width of the moon. All lights remained in ridged formation which never varied. No physical structure or craft  connecting the lights was visible and no stars were obscured.  Elevation was approximately thirty degrees.  A faint engine noise could be heard. Two other people in separate houses under the apparent path of the lights reported hearing a rumbling sound from something passing overhead.  While standing in a street in Grandview, WA, the lights was first seen to the north traveling east. Over the next five minutes they traveled one complete circle around the town until reaching the point where first sighted. Apparent radius of route was maybe three miles. The lights then traveled north east toward the Hanford Nuclear Reservation until out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));46.2542;-119.9165
