Grand Coulee Damn sighting of fireball that turned in mid air while changing speeds intermitently.;2010-07-11 23:30:00;5 minutes approx;Grand Coulee Damn sighting of fireball that turned in mid air while changing speeds intermitently. On vacation at Grand Coulee Damn on Lake Roosevelt 9 people witnessed the following account.  There was a glowing orange ball moving steadily directly toward us from the East.  It was much bigger than a star, I thought it was a meteor going to hit the earth. Suddenly, it stopped moving.  Then it turned, sharply, to the North and continued at a slower pace, with short bursts of speed.  Then it got smaller and began to burn out.  It just looked like something that is running out of fuel, where it would glow brightly, then suddenly dim, then burn bright for a few more seconds until it finally went out. Had it not stopped in mid air and turned I would've sworn it was a meteor.  None of us had ever seen anything like it.
