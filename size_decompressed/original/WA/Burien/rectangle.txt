green, glowing rectilinear object streaking across night sky, E to W, in West Seattle;2003-09-05 23:30:00;2 sec;green, glowing rectilinear object streaking across night sky, E to W, in West Seattle My house is located at Seola Beach and overlooks Puget Sound, facing southwest.  I was watching television at 11:30 p.m. when I observed a glowing, emerald green object moving incredibly fast from east to west, before moving out of sight over Vashon Island.  The object was quite large, approximately the same size as a commercial jet.  It was rectilinear with a triangular point facing west and two oblong wings at each end of the rectangle.  Another curious fact is that there was no sound associated with the movement of the craft.;47.4514;-122.3437
