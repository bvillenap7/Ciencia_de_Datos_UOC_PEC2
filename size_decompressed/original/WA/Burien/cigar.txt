When My mom and I were driving to a soccer clinic i looked left and noticed a cigar shaped form stationary in the sky. we stopped at a red light when my view was blocked for about 10 seconds then i looked right again and notcied there was a cloud form around it when another building blocked my view then the cigar shaped object disapeared as well as the cloud form. The object remained stationary throughtout the sighting and the object was white with a black outline.;47.4514;-122.3437
