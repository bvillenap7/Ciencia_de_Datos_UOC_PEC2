Amber colored oval shape floating/hovering west of Burien.;2012-12-31 23:45:00;5 minutes;Amber colored oval shape floating/hoovering west of Burien, toward Puget Sound.  I and 2 others witness the unexplainable sight.  I referenced the appearence to be jellyfish like, but amber in color, with whiteish strings in the center area .  Also,it was odd that when trying to look at or focus on the ufo my eyes felt like they were going crosseyed.  Lastly, the 3 of us (working at restaurant) all agreed that we had never seen ANY thing like this,  EVER!;47.4514;-122.3437
