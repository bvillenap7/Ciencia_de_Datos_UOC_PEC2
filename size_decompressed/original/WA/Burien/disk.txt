On October 3rd driving south bound on Ambaum Blvd SW proceeded to stop at a 3-way traffic light on 144th St.   At 18:20:01, I snapped a picture with my Samsung Galaxy III camera phone.  I did not originally see the object until after I looked at the picture.  Above the first traffic light from the left, a saucer shaped object appears to be going north with 3 slightly curved tracers to the right of it.   I was attempting to snap a photo of the white cloud towards the bottom of the photo.;47.4514;-122.3437

((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be serious-minded.  He has both military, and aviation, background.  However, his photo strongly suggests to us that the object was a large, helium-filled balloon, in the shape of an oblate spheroid, with other objects suspended below it on some type of cord or cable.  However, the witness reports that the cluster suddenly accelerated, and climbed out of site very quickly, which one would not expect for a balloon.  PD));47.4514;-122.3437
