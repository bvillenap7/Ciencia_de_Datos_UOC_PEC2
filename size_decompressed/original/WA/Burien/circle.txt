Walking North on residential street and low on the horizon saw a red/orange small round object moving South toward me.  Very high, made no sound.  As it went over my head it faded away or went up into atmosphere and disappeared.  Looked North again, here comes another one.  Repeated five times with two objects pretty close to each other, one behind the other.  Went in to get my husband and of course they stopped.   Went out 15 minutes later but didn't see anymore.   At first thought it was fireworks but they were moving quickly south in a very straight line.  Then I thought about drones...they were coming from the direction of Boeing Field.;47.4514;-122.3437
