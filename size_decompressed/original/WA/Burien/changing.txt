The sky was fairly clear over my house but there was a light cloud cover that I noticed at sunset.   I spotted an orange object that I intially thought was a helicopter coming from the east traveling in a south western pattern.  Because I thought it looked strange so I took a photo with my smart phone camera.  I quickly magnified the image and it did not look like a helicopter.   After the first orange object faded from my view, another orange light traveling in the same pattern came into my view.  Both objects were cruising at a casual speed, probably as fast as a helicopter.   The objects were silent and the orange light appeared to be changing from small to bigger and then bigger to small.   Just as the second one faded out of my view, a third one came along traversing in the same pattern.  Then another after that one.  At this point after seeing 3-4 orange objects I started! shooting a video of the orange/orb lights passing by.  I got about 9 minutes of solid footage.  I was in shock as I witnessed the first 3, I have never seen anything like it.  It was either a group of top secret military helicopters or off-world extraterrestrial UFOs?  I feel it might be the ladder, but I can not be sure.   I saw about 10-12 orange/orb lights one after another flying in the same pattern between approximately 10:27pm -10:47pm Pacific Standard time.
