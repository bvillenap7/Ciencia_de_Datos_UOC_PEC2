Silver teardrop 40' above ground.;2004-06-13 11:30:00;12 seconds;Silver teardrop 40' above ground. Silver, metallic object approximately 5'-10' across, shaped like a teardrop on its side, moving about 40 feet off the ground above Highline Hospital. Appeared like a drop of mercury, moving in direction of wider end. Although overcast, the object looked like it was reflecting the sun, in that a bright light shown near the top of the object. It moved horizontally, slowly, occasionally making quick (1/2 second) vertical adjustments of 3-5 feet while maintaining a slow, steady northerly horizontal course, parallel to the ground. The quick vertical adjustments were not consistent with the wind nor with the dynamics of a balloon.  The object drifted behind a tree, where it was lost to view. The object made no sound, and didn't appear to frighten birds that were plentiful in the area. We are within 1 mile of SeaTac airport and turned on a scanner to see if ground control or approaching pilots could see the craft, but heard no strange reports or cautions regarding weather balloons.;47.4514;-122.3437
