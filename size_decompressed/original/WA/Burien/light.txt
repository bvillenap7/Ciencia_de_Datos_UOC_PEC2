I went in and viewed the object from our binoculars, which were set up in our kitchen window. The object filled the viewing from the binoculars to where I had to back off the distance. Once in focus A very bright obscure light with a trailing tail was visable. I followed it in a northerly direction, the object appeared to seperate into three different balls of light. I then went back out on my deck where mywife was still watching the object, I agin started to video the object.Approximately 15 min after first seeint the object it was no longer visable.;47.4514;-122.3437

Reddish light moving in a zig zag pattern;2018-04-19 01:30:00;5-6 minutes;Reddish light moving in a zig zag pattern In my driveway facing S-SE, looking up higher than the position of Jupiter, the brightest object at the time, looking almost overhead S, I saw a bright, almost reddish light moving, sometimes almost in a zig zag pattern as it appeared to move higher.  Up, to almost over the top of my head as I’m looking South. Kept “hopping” not in a smooth movement but almost jumpy.  Weather balloon?  Watched for 3-5 minutes. Looked away then up again and lost sight.  Possibly more at the top (zenith) but if it was what I saw, and the same object, then it was fainter as though moving beyond view.  Didn’t appear to move like normal aircraft and it was silent.;47.4514;-122.3437
3 Satellites cross overhead and pulse bright white;2020-05-19 22:46:00;90 seconds;3 Satellites cross overhead and pulse bright white I was just watching the stars through a 70% cloudy sky, and saw a satellite heading NW of normal brightness moving at normal speed, then it turned really bright for a second, like it was rotating the bright a light mounted on one side, and seemed to roll over the other side in a smooth motion.  Like the light on top of a Lighthouse, spinning around one time (as opposed to a regular lighthouse spinning repeatedly). It kept travelling at the same speed, and seconds later I saw another satellite coming from a different angle heading south, but the same speed.  Then a third appeared from its own angle going SW, and this one pulsed bright for a second just like the first one, all of them white moving dots.  They all crossed paths within 15 seconds of each other and kept going.  My phone camera couldn't capture the video, the whole event lasted about 90 seconds.
