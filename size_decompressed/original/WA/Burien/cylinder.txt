It was leaving a long trail of bright yellow and white and looked comet-like in a  way.I believe it was something burning up and heard some kids saw similar event in grays harbor so perhaps it was breaking up over large distance. It arched downward and vanished leaving two huge white trails going N by NW over Vashon Island and toward the olympic mountains ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports of this event.  We suspect a meteor.  PD));47.4514;-122.3437
