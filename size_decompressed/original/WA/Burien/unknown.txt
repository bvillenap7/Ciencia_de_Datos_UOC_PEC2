When the weather stopped the horrific loud airplane noises started at dark.  It's 1 am and they are still at it about every 5 min.  It's very disturbing and we are Not in the normal sea tac flight path.  They seem to be flying low because they sound very loud and are slow flying as they pass over low.  There seem to be many aircraft and they seem to want the secrecy of dark cloud cover! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
