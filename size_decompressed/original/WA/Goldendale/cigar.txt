Cigar-shaped craft seen in Goldendale, Washington.;2013-08-01 15:00:00;10 minutes;Cigar-shaped craft seen in Goldendale, Washington. In the summer of 2013, my children were playing outside in the middle of the afternoon. They came bursting inside the house and said they saw a UFO and wanted me to come and look.   I went outside, and to my amazement, there was a metal, cigar or blimp shaped craft hovering above the woods.  It was not directly above us, but aways off and hovering about as high as a low flying helicopter.  It looked about the size of a washing machine, from where we were, but cigar- or blimp-shaped.   The sighting lasted 10 minutes and it just dissolved away before our very eyes.  It made no noise, and it hovered in place the whole time.   The children and I saw this same craft about 3 more times this summer.   At the last sighting, my neighbor was over talking with me in my backyard.  The children who saw it first, pointed it out to us in the sky.  We all stood and watched it for about 10 minutes and it too dissolved and disappeared.
