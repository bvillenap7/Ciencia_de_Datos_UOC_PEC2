On the horizon off to our right - seemingly out of the Centerville Valley area a disk shape rose up from the earth with a huge triangular shaped fired jet blast coming out of it. The disk was dark but the jet blast was very very bright. It rose upward and westward then stopped - appeared to change to a 3-D view rather than flat fiew - then simply disappeared jet blast and all leaving a film of smoke in the sky. It took approximatley 5 minutes maybe less. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder if the witnesses observed the missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 1936 hrs. on Monday, October 14, 2002.  Many other reports from WA and OR.  We have changed the date here, based on our assumption.  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD));45.8354;-120.8035
