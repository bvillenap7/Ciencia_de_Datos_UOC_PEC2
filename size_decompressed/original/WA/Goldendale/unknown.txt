No noise, object partially tranparent, possibly metallic with a mirror type pollish effect.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-20 12:09:00;4 seconds;no noise object partially tranparent possibly metallic with a mirror type pollish effect. Went outside in the front of my place to dump trash bag, check for mail then tighten the mount for my flag, because of wind gusts.  After I got done putting my flag up I turned to the east and seen an partially transparent object moving oddly to the southeast.  I didn't hear any noise, it looked like it was floating and I could not make out what the shape of it was.  All I seen was reflections coming off of it, cloudy with the sun light blocked out of the sky.  It could of been metallic with a mirror type polish over it.  Object was about a mile away floating around between 1000 feet to 2000 feet above the ground.  My position was northwest of it, the area that it floated over is a high School.  By the time I had went in and got my binoculars and back out, it had disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.8354;-120.8035
