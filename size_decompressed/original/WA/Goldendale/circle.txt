Bright greenish light heading north-east;1999-09-25 19:30:00;3-5sec;Bright greenish light heading north-east I was heading out my grandma front door when I glanced to the east and caught a glance of a bright green ball.  It was just getting dark out, the craft was about 2 inches and it looked to be about thirty miles away.  It left a trail like a air plane, I saw it as it went between some trees. It was heading north-east towords Hanford and the Yakima Firing Center.;45.8354;-120.8035
