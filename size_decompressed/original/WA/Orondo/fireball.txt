Fireball sighting with apparent explosion;2008-08-03 00:10:00;2 secs max;Fireball sighting with apparent explosion Early August 3, 2008 right at 12:10 AM I was driving south from Chelan WA along the Columbia River heading to  East Wenatchee on Hiway 97 when I saw a brilliant fireball streaking apparently west to east it was visible for perhaps 2 seconds at most. What was unusual was that instead of the soft white light usually associated with meteorites this exhibited a brilliant white light with a slight golden hue and without the usual long streaking tail seen along with a typical meteor. Instead of a tail there were tongues of red flame flying out from behind. The fireball, to my left from my vantage point as I drove along, disappeared behind Badger Mountain and as it went behind the crest of the hill I could see the glow which then momentarily grew very intense and then collapsed which would indicate that it had exploded;47.6969;-120.1721
