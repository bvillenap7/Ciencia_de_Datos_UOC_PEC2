Strange moon shpaed object that continues to move from side to side ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));2004-05-04 12:00:00;45 minutes;Strange moon shpaed object that continues to move from side to side I have been watching this object that looks like the moon or a planet for over 45 minutes.  At first I thought it was an aircraft looking large from the fog or cloud cover. It is still there.  It keeps moving from side to side and then becomes still.  It looks just like the moon but is so much smaller.  It moves in strange ways.  Then bcomes completely still.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));47.9229172;-122.2143404
Bright white oval craft;2008-10-27 02:00:00;5-10 seconds;Bright white oval craft This event took place on 10/27/2008 at 2 am there were 4 of us sitting around a burn barrel doing some strike duty.  The night was clear not a cloud in the sky with the stars very visible in the sky, when all of a sudden this oval shaped bright white craft with a haze around it  appeared out of no where, shot at about a 45 degree angle towards the ground and then just disappeared the speed was very fast.  If I was to guess at the speed it had to have been well over 200 mph the event lasted only a couple of seconds. This in no way was a shooting star I saw one earlier that night, it was not an airplane nor any kind of other light source like a search light , I  have never witnessed anything like this nor my buddies we were talking about this for the next couple of hours.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Amber oval object in sky over Everett WA;2010-07-10 22:35:00;2 min;Amber oval object in sky over Everett, WA My husband and I saw an amber oval object in the southern sky over Everett, WA.   It was a clear evening with no clouds.  We watched it for a couple of minutes.  It was going slow, in a zig zag pattern, it looked like it came to a stop, then it backed up, then it ascended and went out of site.   None of the movements were fast, it wasn't in a hurry to leave.   When my husband was in the Phillipines in 1966, he saw something similar.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Bright red orb seen on July 4th;2011-07-04 22:30:00;approx. 2min;Bright red orb seen on July 4th My wife and were sitting on my front deck watching fireworks.  I was looking to the north and I saw a red orb at first I thought it was fireworks but the red orb continued to head in our direction.  The orb flew over head with no sound and it appeared to have a rotating red light.   Then approx. 25 min. later in the eastern sky we saw the same type of orb but this one kept appearing and disappearing eventually disappearing all together.   I was hesitant at first to write this down, but I saw that more people saw the same type of orb all over the country.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

When I went to shut it I looked up and saw strange lights in the sky.   At first I thought it might be a plane but it hovered and wobbled back and forth.  It was an oval shape object with two gold lights and one red light  ho I called my boyfriend who was outside to look, he saw them briefly then they went behind the clouds and the blinking stopped.

l think I just saw a UFO:   A bright orange red pulsing for about 8-10 seconds in the sky and it went east in a matter of two;2013-08-12 00:00:00;20;l think I just saw a UFO A bright orange red pulsing for about 8-10 seconds in the sky, and it went east in a matter of two l think I just saw a UFO  A bright orange red pulsing for about 8-10 seconds in the sky and it went east in a matter of two seconds, and then it disappeared.  This was in in North West Everett Washington in the historical area.  Minutes from the Navy Base.   Don't know much about military time so guessing it happened a little before 11:30, and my wife  saw it out the bathroom window again after I saw it vanish.   So we went out to film it and uploaded it to youtube.  We could see it with the naked eye but the video its real vague.  What I don't understand is being so close to the Navy base why nobody was alarmed as far as the police or military.  Better technology would be better to see it I'm sure.   The video is below.  Uploaded from my phone to youtube.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3VIrKQkeLk;47.9229172;-122.2143404
