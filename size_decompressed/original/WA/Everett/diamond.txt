Diamond Shaped Craft;2003-06-08 20:00:00;20 Minutes;Diamond Shaped Craft Me & 3 friends were camping out in the woods on south Broadway.  My 1 friend went to the store that was about 15 minutes away, so he just got back after it was over.  My other friend was with me, and he was the first one to spot the craft.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere and was hovering over a clearing that is now thick brush between Colby & Broadway.  It was illuminated and made no sound. I could see no propulsion of any kind.  It pulsed golden white light. It kept slowly swaying back and forth about 30 feet above the ground.  The entire time we watched 3 black unmarked helicopters were flying near it as though they were watching it.   It then turned into a golden streak of light and vanished.  Soon after the temperature in the woods dropped so low our teeth were chattering.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
