Two Objects in late afternoon, camouflaging themselves in the clouds, translucent, traveling east above 45th ave., then north, then rap;1977-09-01 16:00:00;10 minutes;Two Objects in late afternoon, camouflaging themselves in the clouds, translucent, traveling east above 45th ave., then north, then rapidly east toward mountains.  Could move in all directions in darting motions. When I was approximately 10 years old, my mother and I witnessed two objects traveling above us as we were driving on 45th ave. in Everett east toward I-5.  They were above us darting just under the clouds and traveling slightly faster than us.  I remember thinking that their shape was like the paper airplanes I used to make with pointed fronts, like elongated triangles, but they were translucent and the light reflected off them, though they looked like they were projecting cloud-like images on their surface. As we turned north onto I-5, they flew over the freeway, still just under the clouds and east, then turned north also and flew at about our same speed for about 5 minutes.  Then when we were between Everett and Marysville, they shot east toward the mountains at a highly accelerated rate.  It was so fast that it took only maybe 2 seconds for them to disappear from sight.  We never reported it because we had no proof, but after listening to a radio show about the UFO center I was encouraged to give my account.  We really aren't even sure of the year let alone the time and date.  I just remember that it was not very cold, a partially cloudy, partially sunny day.  Until I called the UFO center, I had never heard of anyone else seeing a UFO during the day.  These two could travel forward, backward, and side to side with the ease of a hummingbird.  My mother and I have talked about it through the years and told others, but never recorded it in writing until now.  The objects didn't really changed color so much as the patterns they projected seemed to vary as they passed under the clouds so as to blend in.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Triangular UFO with maroon lights over Everett Washington.;1994-08-09 23:00:00;15 minutes;Triangular UFO with maroon lights over Everett Washington I was outside with cousins when the oldest one pointed out a UFO straight up in the sky. It was a clear starry sky.  It seem really high up in the sky, if one was to hold up a quarter an arms length might have been even smaller say a nickel.  It was not round but rather an equilateral triangle.  There was a maroon light (the size of an average star) on each corner and one in between the corners (on two sides).   I feel like one side didn’t have a red light in the middle but there could have been.  The brightness of the maroon lights didn’t stand out too much from the stars probably same intensity only maroon colored. Its location was fixed in one spot (for 15 min).  The only movement it made was the rotation.  It was rotating clockwise very slowly at a constant speed, maybe one revolution per minute.  There was no sound coming from it.  We looked at it for about 10-15 minutes and then went inside to tell the adults but no one paid any attention to us.  We didn’t! go back outside.

Three Triangler shaped crafts flying in triangler formation. The crafts were flying faster than any aircraft I know about. There was little to no sound, except a quiet buzzing/whistling sound almost a hum The crafts were lighted with a solid color of white light. No flashing or blinking lights were seen. The crafts were flying from the South to North.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

I-5 Triangle UFO in Everett;2003-05-27 22:30:00;00:00:15;I-5 Triangle UFO in Everett I was driving north on I-5 at 10:30 at night and traffic came to a quick halt.  I almost hit the semi infront of me trying to get a look at this thing.  It was triangle shaped and on the bottom of the craft, I saw a white light a red light and a green light. One light at each corner of the craft.  The lights flashed one at a time in an orderly pattern.  It was flying very low and I rolled down the window to try to hear it, but it made no sound.  I watched it float across I-5 and into the trees, where it seemed to disappear.  I know other people on I-5 saw this thing because traffic stopped for the exact moment that it passed over the highway. I keep telling myself it was a plane, but I really can't say for sure!  I'm hoping someone will tell me that it was a plane.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
I saw a triangle ufo with four white lights moving quickly with no sound in Everett Wa.;2009-09-17 09:50:00;10 seconds;I saw a triangle ufo with four white lights moving quickly with no sound in Everett Wa. To whom it may concern,  I was smoking a cigarette outside my house at around 9:50 PM tonight and looking up at the night sky. It was pretty dark outside in my neighborhood as we live on the end of a dead end road.  The Navel station in Everett is to the Northwest of us.  All at once, I saw 4 lights moving in unison very low about 250ft off the ground over me and moving rapidly to the southwest.  I could see no edges but it was dead black almost like a rippling void or a nothingness except for the perfectly spaced solid white lights that made up the triangle and what looked to be a center light.  I could see no reflection or there was no color just lights that were dim and not bright at all as I have would expected from a ufo craft.  The thing that just still is giving me chills is the total lack of sound.  It made no noise not even a little.   The whole sighting lasted about 10 seconds maybe.  I am still shaken up as it scared me and gave me a fight or flight response and I'm a pretty cool character.  Anyway I felt like I needed to tell someone that might understand and I hope this helps if others saw it in my area.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted));47.9229172;-122.2143404
Swiftly moving triangle with brighter lights at all three corners, plus one in the center.;2012-04-22 21:36:00;4 seconds;Swiftly moving triangle with brighter lights at all three corners, plus one in the center. I was watching for, and had observed the listed ISS sightings as posted on the NASA website for sightings, as it was a clear mild night here in Everett, Snohomish, WA. Although I have never heard of “PROGRESS46P”, it was also included in the NASA listings, so I thought I would see what I could see of that, too. I didn’t really know what I was looking for, but it was a nice evening and decided to watch the sky for that.  Instead, what I saw was a thing shaped like a perfect triangle with all three points a bit brighter, plus another point of light in the center equally bright. There were “lines” connecting all 3 sides, but nothing to the center light. It moved swiftly across the sky, but slow enough for me to focus upon it. It moved much faster than the ISS I had just observed. It was a very pale amber color overall. It followed a path similar to what I was expecting from both the ISS and PROGRESS46P, as their times were similar, as follows:  [9:26PM--ISS tonight viewing duration was supposed to be for 3 minutes, 87 degrees maximum elevation, with an approach of 36 degrees WNW, and a departure of 23 degrees ESE.] A few minutes later, PROGRESS was to be as follows:  [9:34PM—PROGRESS46P viewing duration was supposed to be for 3 minutes, 83 degrees maximum elevation, with an approach of 34 degrees above WNW, and a departure of 31 degrees above ESE.]  I never saw PROGRESS—not sure what it looks like. I have seen the ISS many times if the sky is clear. But I have never seen a fast-moving “Triangle On a Mission”! How interesting!!;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Large triangular shaped orange light hovering minutes over my home.;2012-05-03 21:00:00;5 minutes;Large triangular shaped orange light hovering minutes over my home. At 9pm on May 3rd while watering the flowers in the front yard of my home I looked up in the sky to see an orange light slowly coming towards my house about a mile up in the sky.  Living close to a naval station I am quite aware of the types of aircraft that frequent the area.  This light however was different in that as it approached was a brilliant burnt orange and moved gracefully and silent towards my home.  As it came into view, it did not resemble aircraft of anything I am used to seeing, ie..Life flight, charter planes, 737's etc.  This light slowed and then hovered above my street, and was absolutely silent, it glowed a beautiful orange, appearing at first triangular in shape becoming  super bright then shrunk to the size of a small star in the sky turning bright white.  After a moment it resumed its original size.  It remained in a stationary position until I ran up to my front window to alert my husband who was in the house.  I was probably gone 3 seconds from where I was originally standing when I looked up and noted it had disappeared.  I quickly went for a walk thru the neighborhood and could not locate it.  I live on a bluff over looking the water and had it been a normal aircraft I could have easily caught up with it.  This one, however I could not.  In all honesty, I felt like it was merely observing, and for whatever reason I was able to see it.  It did mimic some characteristics that I observed of some other UFO's while visiting Gilliland Ranch near Mt. Adams, so I know I wasn't imagining this.  Felt quite fortunate for the experience.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Flying Lights/Orbs in Triangle Formation In South Everett, WA.;2012-09-12 00:35:00;9-10 seconds;Flying Lights/Orbs in Triangle Formation In South Everett, WA Occurred: 9/12/2012  12:35 AM PST Location: Everett, WA Shape: Triangle Duration: 9-10 Seconds. Object/Formation with six orange/red lights in equilateral triangle formation flying NE over South Everett, over NW corner of Everett Mall parking lot. I went out on my first break of the evening (was at work) to stargaze and relax. It was a clear, open sky, with clear visibility of the stars. While looking directly up into the night sky, a perfect triangle of orange/red lights flew directly overhead at a high rate of speed at an altitude of approximately 500-1,000 ft. At first I thought it was a very low flying airplane, but it made absolutely no sound whatsoever. It wasn't solid, I could see the stars through it. There were three smaller lights in a similar equilateral triangle in the center of the formation (looking up). None of the lights were blinking, they were steadily lit. It moved in a North Easterly direction then changed trajectory to North, North East and changed formation slightly and the lights dimmed out slowly as they flew away. The initial shape of the objects were an equilateral triangle flying/pointing towards the NE, then changed slightly to a non-geometric shape uncoordinated looking, but still flying together as they dimmed out. As they dimmed out I could see that the lights were definitely circular/orb-shaped. The initial brightness of the three outer lights was approximately -4, -5 magnitude, very similar to standard aircraft strobe lights, except these didn't strobe/rotate, and were a little dimmer. I have watched various airplanes fly since I was a young boy, love flying and have seen flight in night and daylight. I have never seen anything like this before. I was facing directly North towards a two-story building next door the duration of the whole event was approximately nine to ten seconds. I've also noticed light/white colored helicopters flying over the area starting around August 23, 2012. Usually flying alone, but sometimes two flying together in tandem at various hours, but usually between 9:00PM to 6:00AM when I am at work in the area. There was one hovering over Highway 99 near the intersection of West Casino Road approx 6:05 AM of the same morning not sure if this is related, just reporting what I saw.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

We were lying on the lawn enjoying the neighborhood fireworks when we noticed a triangular shaped object with one white light and one red light on the rear points of the triangle.   Its elevation was extremely high, it move slowly from east to west and the only indication of its form was a strange silvery glow eminating from the flat outline of its perimeter, like three rulers arranged to form a triangle.   No sound was detected, though with fireworks nothing could have been obviouly heard.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

I was driving southbound I-5 off of Broadway Exit in Everett, WA, at approx 3:00 am on Saturday, 3/8/14, when I saw were 3 lights hovering over the flatlands of Snohomish.   These lights did not move, nor did they change color or shape.  They were in a triangular setup, with one light and two others directly below.   I am not sure if they were connected, or just very close together.  They just hovered there,  a hundred feet or so off the ground.   I could see them the entire time I passed them on the freeway.   There were other cars travelling on the road as well, hence the multiple witness question.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
