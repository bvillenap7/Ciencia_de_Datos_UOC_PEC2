Bright Green blazing ball passing from Northeast to Southwest burning out before the horizon.;1998-09-23 21:11:00;2 seconds;Bright Green blazing ball passing from Northeast to Southwest burning out before the horizon. I was driving on Southbound I-5 and just passed under the 23rd Street Bridge in Everett, WA (between exits 194 and 195) and suddenly out the top of the vehicle windsheild I observed a bright green ball with a brighter center pass throught the sky.  It was trailing faint red sparks.  I believed it burned out before reaching the horizion as i continued to follow the trajectory after it wnet out to see what would happen nothing did but I had no horizontal reference point so it may have passed over the horizon.  The direction noted at the time was Northeast to Southwest.  The altitude upon sighting was extremely high and then it lost altitude as it moved to the Southwest from the Northeast.  The range from inception was just South and an undetermined distance east and it moved considerably down range during the sighting.  As for the altitude and range estimations no Earth visual clues were availible.  Immediately upon seeing this object I noted my watch as 9:11 Pacific Daylight Savings time. The object itself:  Since there was not a frame of reference the exact or reasonably estimated size object is unknown.  The object was large and the green light probaly could have illuminated clouds if they had been around.  The color was bright emerald green.  The center of the ball was almost bright white/green and it was about 20% of the diamter of the object.  The object also trailed a sparky red tail that was about 2 times longer than the grren ball's diameter.  Interesting to note is that I was driving at about 60 mph and the object was spotted out the top of the windsheild.  I wonder how far it may have traveled before I started observing it.  Also interesting there was no noise from this object.  Bacground on the author.  B.S. Civil Engineering from University of Washington.

Flying fire spheres decending then accending out of sky over Everett WA 1 mile. above city.;2009-08-18 21:30:00;2 minutes;Flying fire spheres decending then accending out of sky over Everett WA 1 mile. above city. It’s been roughly 30 minutes sense the experience. My girlfriend and I had just finished a long walk in the park and were now 10-15 feet from the car. It had just gotten dark with a barley noticeable hint of light off in the sunset horizon. The parking lot was slightly lit with a few street lights but still dark. From one split second to the next, a very bright glowing object caught my eye from behind one of the tree tops, slightly to my right. I immediately grabbed my girlfriend and pointed it out to her. It seemed to take a quick second before it registered to her, then as I remember her words, Oh, my gosh. At this moment I thought I was seeing a flaming meteorite coming toward the mill creek area from the North West sky. I thought it was going to impact upon Mill Creek (a small suburban area adjacent to the South end of Everett). It was heading south east toward the ground. A second object followed directly behind the first in the exact same path. The airborne objects proximity seemed to be approximately 1-2 miles away, seemly closer to a mile. Their estimated size was impressive appearing the equivalency of a small to medium size two story house. If I were to extend my arm and hold my thumb in the sky to its location it would have easily doubled the size of my thumbnail, if not larger.  After 8-12 seconds of first sighting, it became vividly apparent that this was defiantly not a meteorite. There was a brief moment where I wondered if this object was an aflame, out of control aircraft. After 15-20 seconds of continued observation, I identified the object as a controlled, somewhat slow moving object that was not a part of the natural occurring environment. Shortly after continued observation the object did appear to have flames coming from it, however they were not out of control. It appeared to have a spherical globe around it containing and controlling the flames. It’s steady, even and concise movements quickly made it apparent that it was not aflame. Moreover, the spherical globe around it became more visible. These observations were taking place as the object stopped its downward movement toward Mill Creek and began an upward climb out of the city. Its movement was so clean, even and precise that its rapid accent was one of the most intriguing points abo! ut the entire sighting. It disappeared without seeming like it was moving fast. In an instant it was gone as it appeared to move directly out of our atmosphere. The second object followed suit exactly.  TO BE 100% CLEAR AND UNSWERVINGLY CLEAR ABOUT THREE THINGS: 1.	This was not an aircraft even remotely resembling any aircraft within the worldwide public aeronautics industry. 2.	This sensory experience defies many laws of physics and rational thought. I am a scientific mind and have always required tested proof to accept something as fact. These beliefs have all been challenged with this experience. I am forever affected. 3.	I now know for a fact that there are things in our reality that we don’t have a clue about, that we cannot comprehend. Even if the airborne object I saw was government owned, it was far beyond explanation. I am finally at peace.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Bright star like craft spotted in Everett WA. 4/15/13;2013-04-15 23:00:00;15 minutes;Bright star like craft spotted in Everett WA. 4/15/13 Driving on the freeway an large star came to my attention.  It was huge, bright, and flashing reds, yellows, and oranges. I kept my eyes on it for at least 6 exits on the freeway.  Soon I tapped my passenger on the shoulder and showed her what I was witnessing.  We watched it for 5 min without taking our eyes off of the craft.  After 5 min passed it just disappeared.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
I observed an orange fireball about1/6 the size of the moon, traveling across the sky at a moderate speed twice in a 10 minute period.;2013-09-02 22:45:00;15 minutes;I observed an orange fireball about1/6 the size of the moon, traveling across the sky at a moderate speed twice in a 10 minute period. At 22:45, 09/02/13 I was at home in bed sleeping in an upstairs bedroom.  I awoke and needed to go to the bathroom.  I got up and walked across the room and stopped at a sliding glass door to an upper deck and looked out.  The house is surrounded by trees, however looking straight West there is about a 15 degree brake in the trees where I could see the sky.  Looking into this brake about 20 degrees above the horizon I could see an orange fireball coming across the sky at a moderate speed from NW to SE.  This object was about as bright as the moon and probably 1/6th the size of the moon if the moon had been at the same location in the sky.  I proceeded out onto the deck for a better look.  I called for my wife, who was watching TV down stairs.   The object proceed in a straight line for about 60 seconds and then started a slow right turn which brought it’s path to pass behind some tree tops.  My wife and I could still see the object as it continued the turn u! ntil it seemed to be going to the West where after another 45 seconds it disappeared. I continued to the bathroom and returned to the doorway after about four to five minutes.  I looked out and again saw the object.  I called my wife and walked back out on the deck again.  The object again was coming across the sky from the NW to the SE pretty much in the same position.  Moving at the same speed, and in the same direction.   As it neared again it started a right turn, however, this turn was a little wider and eventually was obscured by the trees.  I watched the sky for another 30 minutes and never saw it again. I am a retired professional pilot with a long career flying general aviation aircraft from crop dusters to corporate jets.  I still own and fly my own personal aircraft.  I am very used to observing all type of man made objects in the sky.  This is definitely not like any flying object I have ever seen before.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Intense red glowing light seen east of Everett WA, similar in description to the one seen in Renton WA a day earlier.;2013-09-08 23:15:00;~3 minutes;intense red glowing light seen east of Everett WA, similar in description to the one seen in Renton WA a day earlier. Amending report.  The intense red glowing light came out of the north east and turned south east near my location on Ebey Island which is just east of Everett WA.  It had a shimmering aura and as it entered the relatively low clouds, the clouds lit up as the object itself disapeared.  I just read the report from the man and wife in Renton WA.  Their description of the event was so similar to mine including the possible trojectory and time frame, the difference being the date theirs being 09-07 and mine 09-08.   The original posting of my siting was done in haste and may not have been posted.  I couldn't find it, but was so excited to read the report from Renton that I had to write another.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Fireball seen at the same time two other reports from my town were reported.;2013-09-18 22:00:00;45 seconds;Fireball seen at the same time two other reports from my town were reported. I saw the exact same UFO as reported by two other people from my city during the same time period.  I was out in my driveway having a cigarette.   Looked up and saw a flickering red / orange colored object slowly moving from NW to SE.  I filmed it with my phone and took a picture of it.   Towards the end of the sighting it started flickering and eventually went dark.   After it went out I could still clearly see an outline of an object, still moving across the sky until I lost view of the unlit object over my garage.  I work in aviation and have never seen anything like this.  I have video and a picture.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Red fireball flying through sky.;2014-07-13 22:20:00;2 minutes;Red fireball flying through sky We noticed a red fireball flying east through the sky at a constant speed, it did not change direction or shape.   We lost sight of it after it left field of vision. It was not an airplane or a helicopter for it had no flashing lights plus both a helicopter and an airplane were in the area due to an airport being near by. 1 observer is amateur astronomer ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

While standing at my window with the window open I saw 1-2 orange-ish/ Fire colored lights in the sky over the Everett area near Boeing;2015-07-20 03:20:00;1 minutes;While standing at my window with the window open I saw 1-2 orange-ish/ Fire colored lights in the sky over the Everett area near Boeing,  They were moving in an erratic way for a minute almost doing loops or something.  If you could imagine what it would look like if someone was SLOWLY juggling 2 flaming torches from very far away, that's what it looked like except it was in the sky.  They were not in sync so I think it was two different ones. This went on for about 1 minute and I ran into my bedroom to get my camera,  When I came back and started filming they were gone.  I waited for about 5 min and even went outside to get a better vantage point but they never returned.  The initial sighting was from a window about 30ft from street level, facing east, the window was open/no screen. objects were in the sky at about 45° from me and could not have been less then maybe 1000ft I believe we are not alone in this universe but I am a realistic person,  I have no clue what I seen.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Fireballs over Everett.;2015-09-23 20:00:00;4 hours;Fireballs over Everett. Around 800pm, four of us noticed three fireballs in the sky towards the south.  They flickered and moved back and forth throughout the skies, it slowly changed to four fireballs from three.  They stayed in the sky over the south for a few hours, they continuously moved back and fourth but mostly they just hovered in the sky.  At this point two of my neighbor's came outside and witnessed the lights as well.   Once ten o'clock rolled around, the fireballs slowly, one by one, started to flicker and disappear.  Once the last two were almost gone suddenly multiple man made aircrafts were seen flying in the area with lights, shining them through the clouds in the same spots the fireballs were hovering at.  Since then the birds in the vicinity of where the lights were, have been acting very strange.  They seem as though they are spooked, they seemed almost nervous. They were obviously looking for what we had seen, the lights are usually there every night at the same time they've even been seen during the day.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
