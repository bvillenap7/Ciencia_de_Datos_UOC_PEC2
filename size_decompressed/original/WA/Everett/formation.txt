3 points of light forming a triangle;2000-09-13 17:00:00;10 minutes;3 points of light forming a triangle 3 small points of light almost like stars were directly overhead. There was no noise. They were in a perfect equalatteral triangle for about five minutes and then the light top light moved down and to the left and they formed an isosceles triangle for about five minutes. They remained stationary directly overhead the entire time. They were below a cirrus cloud layer. It was seen by two male sales associates who had never seen anything similiar before.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
My husbund and I was installing our metal roofing then.........;2001-08-05 12:45:00;3 mins;My husbund and I was installing our metal roofing then......... My husbund and I was installing our metal roofing. I was looking towards the monroe area at the mountains.  It was just any summer day, some big clouds and lots of blue sky.  I noticed some thing flying around like bees.  About 5-8 of them flying in and out of the cloulds, from big clould formation to another.  They were like big triangle kites.  My husbund saw this too and kept asking me if I saw it too.  1 min went by and then the crafts dove in the neariest could.  At this time we could hear a fighter jet comming over our heads. Flying from West to East.  When it got to the cloud and went through it, the crafts came out flying is random patterns.  At this time I knew this wasn't birds or really big BEES.  They were bigger than the jet, seeing them at that distance.  Soon after the jet banked left,and tried to come back at the crafts.  But by that time they one by one flew in a straight line upwards.  We talked about this for along time up on that roof.  IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT JET, WE WOULD OF THOUGHT IT WAS NOTHING. I HOPE THAT THERE ARE MORE EYES ON THE SKY DURING THE DAY, AND NOT JUST AT NIGHT.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
3 bright lights in a triangle formation over Everett;2010-07-14 23:10:00;5 min;3 bright lights in a triangle formation over Everett I left Lake Stevens and was driving SB on I-5 from 41st going home.   I looked East and saw 3 bright lights, in the shape of a triangle (a large one) with one bright light at the first point and then 2 at the back on each side. These lights were going southbound, following the I-5 freeway.   There was no noise, no strobe lights flashing, not an airplane or helicopters.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
I witnessed a formation of 7-9 white lights fly silently from East to West at moderate speed and disappear after 3-5 seconds.;2016-02-05 20:30:00;3-5 seconds;I witnessed a formation of 7-9 white lights fly silently from East to West at moderate speed and disappear after 3-5 seconds. I walked outside on my deck to adjust an outdoor FM antenna.  After adjusting it I looked up to check the direction it was facing and noticed the sky had cleared up and there were several stars visible and at that moment I saw a group of white lights in formation flying almost directly overhead from the East to the West.  The size of the lights were approx. half the size of a dime held at arm's length.  The formation did not vary whatsoever and the speed was similar to the landing approach speed of a commercial aircraft.  The sighting lasted 3-5 seconds and then disappeared in an instant.  The visual quality of the lights had an artificial character to them and there was no sound whatsoever. I live within sight of Navel Station Everett where the aircraft carrier Nimitz is home based, though it is currently out of port.  The lights appeared to fly directly over the navy base.   I also live near Paine Field which is used by Boeing to test planes.  The Boeing facility builds the 747 in what is known as the worlds largest building in terms of cubic feet of interior space.  It can hold several 747 aircraft at a time.  This was my first Unidentified Flying Object sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be very serious and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness, and highly reliable.  PD));47.9229172;-122.2143404

One became dim after 15 mins and took off to the south.  Then the next left going south as well.  One remained stationary and finally a new one appeared out of no where.  It remained stationary with the 3rd light and then both became dim and moved off South.  No clouds seen or airplane noises. Stars and planes were visible during the entire episode.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Multiple lights that contracted then retracted into one then disappeared.  ((Starrlink satellites??));2021-05-04 21:00:00;30 seconds;Multiple lights that contracted then retracted into one then disappeared. At about 9:00pm on May 4th, my boyfriend and I decided to walk to the store.  While walking I happened to look up and we saw about 15 or so lights that were in a straight line contracting moving away from each other then shortly after retracted and disappeared.   They stayed in a straight line and the best way of describing it was like a coil or slinky being stretched.  As the line formation contracted the lights grew further apart yet held in line formation and at the end before disappearing they retracted coming back together as one and then disappeared.  Both of us tried taking video and pictures with our phones and were both strangely unable to as both froze...  Strangest yet most intriguing thing Iâ€™ve ever seen!;47.9229172;-122.2143404
