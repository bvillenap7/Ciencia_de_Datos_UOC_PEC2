We then saw a 5 balls of light connnected to each other hovering in the air over the valley. It wasn't the fourth of July (I thought it was a firework at first) so I thought it odd. We all just stared at it as it hovered horizontally with these balls of lights connected together. To this day I have no idea what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Brilliant Streak: 'Lands' at Everett Mall;2000-11-16 23:03:00;5  Seconds;Brilliant Streak: 'Lands' at Everett Mall Just passing Everett Mall Exit, on I-5 Northbound at 11:03 PM Thursday Evening ... I witnessed a VERY Bright Light just above the inside [left of center] of my rear veiw mirror ... It seemed to have appeared out of no were .... as I am nearly certain of NO tree line to have obscured the view of it to have emerged from ... It was traveling from from Right to Left { East to (generally)West begining (I would guess) aproxamatly 300 feet [perhaps a bit more] above the arterial exit path [nearly perfectly] HORIZONTALY as I aproched at aproxamatly 65 miles an hour .... after aproxamately 1 and 1/2 seconds it seemed to begin to falter .. -not so much in its trajectory , but in its progress ... -it seemed to (for an instant) dim -then recharge 3 times .... [ 'wink' -? ] over the next 1 and a half seconds ... as it began to veer towards the south slightly .... then DOWN ...arching over the tall shrub trees just along the parking lot at the north east corner of Everett Mall Bulding Complex ( Bon Marche Store) [ just behind , I believe, or over the top of the The Everett Mall Display Sign .... It was aproxamately HALF the size of my little finger nail ....with arm streached fully , palm out , fingers horizontal .... It was (at least !) as bright as the oncomming trafic lights ...(some 75-100 feet to my left [west] and , at the most Head-on angle ... 250-300 feet ahead of me ..., but seemed MORE intense .. as if- Burning Magnesium .... -It had about Half as many Spikes' around it .. however ... smaller, fainter, more narrow towards the front ... with a few {seemingly) shooting-out [ in a wave-like streaching out ...] or extended  may be a better discription, as these moved or varied little through-out the duration of the event ... [ exept it they 'may-have' had a slight 'streahing'/Pulse effect , not exactly 'normal' -Flickering I would expect ... It  had a Tail .... Sort of like the kind od Steak you`ld see from a bright light in darkness passing quickly before you .... but more solid .. and Shaped ... as if Painted by a Stroke ..... (-in the nights sky ... ) As bright a the Body ... but not as intense ... (consentrated) No Fumes or trail of (Smokey) gaseous emitions detected .... (!) {Even though it was night ... a half moon shown clearly through the crisp clean air ....while progressing .... I noticed some scattered smatterings of fog gatherings along the lowlands aproching downtown ....} As the the last winking ended ... it began a steeper decent ... , but did not Fall -seemed to be in Quarter - Motion .... as I began to pass I under it .. (-it was in my full view at all times from the begining of spoting ...) it culled slightly toward the south ... I followed it with my eyes til it went between two large shrubs over the chain link fence ... I had to turn my head back to the road then (for one I had had my eyes off of it long enough ... -the road felt' as it were ready to curve' ... ad i could`nt twist my head comfortably back any futher ... (in my safty belted position ... ) -personal note : Well Peter  I hope this was decriptive enough ... ( perhaps a bit TOO- Wordy .... ? [!] As I said in the Phone message ... -it may have been more for 911 , But , as I`ve been in the military .... -I remember NO night flares ... OR ANY thing that has LOOKED or ACTED -like this ONE ... !

Possible explanation of 24Feb2003 sighting over Olympic Mountains;2003-02-24 11:30:00;not sure;Possible explanation of 24Feb2003 sighting over Olympic Mountains I work at Boeing in Everett,and at approximately 10:15 am on 24Feb2003,myself and hundreds of other employees watched the first 777ER take of on its first flight.It was accompanied by a small,silver or white colored chase plane,which would have been taking photos of the new airplane.It would have been zipping all around the big jet,taking pictures.It was a beautiful day,perfect photo opportunity. I watched the 777ER and its chase plane take off,heading north.She then turned west,and contiued around south,approximately over the vicinity of the Olympic Mountains.I lost sight of her around 10:30. This could explain the sighting on 24Feb2003 over the Olympics. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));47.9229172;-122.2143404
Our first UFO sighting from downtown Everett, WA area...Pretty Scarey too me!;2007-04-06 23:00:00;5-7seconds;Our first UFO sighting from downtown Everett, WA area...Pretty Scarey too me! this is from my myspace blog, i have replaced our names...

It was going pretty dang fast and quiet, no nise...My boyfriend said it was high up there. It was very erie let me tell you...  It went so fast but not fast enough to stick to my mind.

S-shaped black tumbling Rotating UFO.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-07 12:00:00;30+ seconds;S-Shaped Black Tumbling Rotating UFO. Middle of the day.  Walked outside, looked up and there it was.  It was floating through the air, a dark S-shaped object, maybe teen feet or so in size - maybe a half mile or less in the sky.  These are guesses to size and distance. It tumbled through the sky, and also, the ends of the S would contract at times, then go back to an S shape - and also I did notice that it would also rotate horizontally, and when it did - it seemed as if it was 2-dimensional on that plane, otherwise tubular. At one time during the horizontal, I noticed a kind of yellow semi-transparent square projection shape go over it, in a flash of time. It strangely enough seemed to go directly over my field of view. I thought about it later, that I was feeling the wind from the opposite direction. As I had plenty of time, time of encounter 30+ seconds, I could not see or identify what it is, even observing it intently, and it did not appear to be a balloon of any kind.  There are no balloons sold in any local stores that match this. I then went on the internet to look for s-shaped ufo's and I found some others that have had similar sightings:   http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/135/S135145.html https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/s-shaped-ufo.494236/   Something about this seemed...organic, intelligent, and intentional - rather than simply a piece of trash or balloon floating in the wind.  I say this with all skeptical discernment, as it seemed to be tumbling, as it were-as a means of movement or self-propelling, such as the flagella of a cell moves, rather than simply being an object moved by a current. Unfortunately with these kinds of things, it just doesn't sound that impressive - I understand, as it probably would not to me if I read this report of a UFO without experiencing it directly my self. I am relaying this to see if anyone else has ever seen something like this, or has any ideas ... this is all true my story which I share. I do not have any cameras or phone to take a picture, sorry - but the video of the other sighting looks very similar, even exactly - except for the addition of the other details which I had observed.
