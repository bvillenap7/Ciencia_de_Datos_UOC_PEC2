Polished metallic cylinder stationary in daytime sky slowly rotates then disappears instantly;2003-10-09 16:48:00;2 minutes;Polished metallic cylinder stationary in daytime sky slowly rotates then disappears instantly I was obeserving a Washington State Patrol light airplane circling the area.  As it circled overhead I noticed what appeared to be a star 50 to 60 degrees above the horizon behind the airplane.  I first thought it might be a balloon as the local automobile dealerships use allot of them.  I noticed that it was not moving with the wind, which were 15 to 20 mph.  I then observed the object through 12X50 Bushnell binoculars.  Through binoculars the object resembled highly polished aluminum.  I then thought it was perhaps a milar balloon and continued to observe it.  It then rotated slowly in a clockwise direction to reveal that it was oblong.  It was shaped like a cylindar bisected lengthwise, slightly flared at the bottom edges.  I thought it might be a helicopter at high altitude but there were no rotors visible. While I was observing it it disappeared instantly. Weather was moderate winds and partly cloudy.

At first I thought it was a banner.  It was completely silent.  It was close enough that I could make out that it was gold/silver metallic (reflective) in color.   I ran inside to grab my roommate.  When I came back out, it was silently floating up and towards the west.  It moved slowly.  It was approximately the size of a 747.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
