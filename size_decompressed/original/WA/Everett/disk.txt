Craft with multicolored lights drifted above us.;1999-06-09 22:00:00;25 minutes or so;Craft with multicolored lights drifted above us. We were in a bus going from Lynwood to everett, we were just entering everett when suddenly 3 Disk shaped objects hovering low below the clouds followed the bus for twenty five minutes. The bus driver gazed in astonishment and fear. Some of the passangers got out cameras and took picutres, though no one outside the bus seemed to respond. The crafts were illuminated with what seemed to be fourteen or so very bright lights on the bottom of the craft. It looked like stars floating above us. After the minutes had passed, the craft reversed direction and shot off at unbelieveable speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Reflective object with time loss;2020-10-01 02:37:00;1 hour;Reflective object with time loss I woke up extremely thirsty this morning a little after 2:15am. I went downstairs got water and went onto the porch to smoke.  As I was standing there I saw something rushing through the sky, I thought maybe it was a shooting star or something.  But then it stopped, in an absolute dead halt.  I just stared at it, it was flattish with dome and super glistening/reflective.  I feel like I was staring at it maybe 5mins.  Then it suddenly just was gone like a flash.  I looked at my phone and it was 3:45 and my alarm was going off.  I somehow lost about an hour.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
