Silent light moving fast and low across the sky.;2001-05-06 23:17:00;3-5 seconds;Silent light moving fast and low across the sky. The craft appeared to be a teardrop shape or possibly two spheres.  One larger toward the front and one smaller directly behind it.  It was moving very fast and heading west/southwest.  It made no noise, and appeared out of nowhere and disappeared just as fast.  It was moving horizontaly over the trees (high over the trees) and was in front of the clouds.  I couldn't tell if it appeared and then disappeared, or whether the lights came on and then went off again (which would hide it from view in the night sky).  It was not a spot light or an airplane.  A spotlight would change in distance as it tracked across the clouds, and the beam would be visible and could be tracked to it's source.  It had no running lights like a plane would, and as I stated earlier, it was silent.  I live near and work at Paine Field, so I see planes come and go all day long, and this was something completely different.  I believe it was one craft, but might possibly have been two, assuming they could travel VERY close together.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Seattle Sighting of Comet or Meteor like formation.;2007-10-23 07:30:00;20 Min;Seattle Sighting of Comet or Meteor like formation. During the 7:00 am break at Tect Aerospace factory we spotted a strange comet like light in the sky much brighter than any we have witnessed before.  It was very brilliant with a long tail like projection and disappeared over the horizon after a period of 20 to 30 min.  We may have missed the begining of the event, but at least 25 of us witness the event.   We all have many years experience in observing contrails and such other common occurence and most of us that have military experience agree it was no contrail did anyone else see this event?  We'd like to know.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
