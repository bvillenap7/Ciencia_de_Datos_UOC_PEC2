Returning to bedroom looked out window in livingroom...facing South...saw clouds had cleared. Saw bright white object moving very fast towards the East. Too low to not make noise, and too fast to be airplane with such luminous brightness.Watched it till tree obscured, rushed outside...was almost at front door...looked back towards the East, but had disappeared. I Know what planes sound and look like, and helicopters...this was neither.
