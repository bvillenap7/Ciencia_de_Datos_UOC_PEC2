Egg shaped, fast moving, inside atmosphere, unlit with no sound.;2003-08-26 21:05:00;8 seconds;Egg shaped, fast moving, inside atmosphere, unlit with no sound. While taking a break from work outside, some of us were looking at Mars, which is closest to earth as it has been presently.  Then, I saw an egg shaped object moving quickly across the sky from West to East.  It was unlit, but appeared to be reflecting light from another source.  It covered approximately a 90 degree arc in eight seconds or less.  I tried to point it out to others standing with me, but nobody else picked it out.  One fellow said it must have been an Iridium Satellite because they travel in a low earth orbit, but I dismissed that as there was some high cirrus clouds and the object appeared to be travelling below these clouds.  I have heard no other reports of any unidentified objects.  There was no sound associated with this object. ((NUFORC Note:  There were no overflights of the International Space Station during on this date, and on several days either side of the date indicated above by the witness, so that possibility can be ruled out.  In addition, a man-made satellite would not cover 90 degrees of arc in 8 seconds, including  Iridium satellites, which would not flare for that length of time.  The event seems incompatible with any conventional event that we can think of.  PD));47.9229172;-122.2143404
