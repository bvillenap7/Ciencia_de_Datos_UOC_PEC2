Large Bright Oarnge Ball shaped light and Dark shape above it and weird Star like thing in distance;2003-11-03 00:50:00;5 Min;Large Bright Oarnge Ball shaped light and Dark shape above it and weird Star like thing in distance Aproximatly at 00:50 (12:50AM) on November 3, 2003 Me and my wife went out on our balcony to enjoy a cigerette and to our amazement we noticed a large Bright orange ball shaped light above the tree line in the distance It could not have been on ground or anything because there is no hill side. It was amazing, i ran inside to get my glasses and when i came out it was dimming and getting smaller almost as if it was lowering until it was no longer visible. We also noticed a rectangular shape above the object but could not make it out and we noticed far off in the distance somthing that appeared to be a star but was the same exact color and was directly behind it to the right of it a little and was still there when the object dissapeared and was flashing very oddly and somtimes dissapearing completly and after about 15 min it was completly gone. . Very Strange. The first thing out of my wife and my mouth was OH MY GOD, What THE HELL IS That;47.9229172;-122.2143404

Extremely bright light/object in the sky over Everett, Washington.;2009-01-19 19:00:00;30 min to present;Extremely bright light/object in the sky over Everett, Washington. On January 19, 2009 I was at home with my boyfriend.  We both noticed a bright white light in the sky. The light did not move and was too close to be a star or a planet.  As we were looking at this extremely bright light we saw two different airplanes that appeared to fly very close to the bright object, one of the planes flew from right to left in front of the object and a few minutes later another plane flew from behind and just to the left as if the plane was coming from farther away and then getting closer.   I tried to the record the object three separate times and each time my camera would malfunction about 1 minute in and I would have to take the batteries out of my camera just to turn it off.  We have been watching other airplanes in the sky and it is a very clear evening and the stars are so much farther away than this bright object.  We aren't sure what this bright light in the sky is but it looks as if it is just floating in one spot ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));47.9229172;-122.2143404
Wobbly orbs flying east then ascending at great speeds.;2010-07-05 01:30:00;4 minutes;Wobbly orbs flying east then ascending at great speeds. I was getting out of my car, when I noticed what seemed to be a wobbly airplane flying East.  I notified my friend, and we both watched it as it came closer, then it started ascending upwards until it just disappeared.   About a minute or so later I looked out the window and there it was again, flying East.  Then it disappeared into the clouds.  A few minutes later there were 3 more flying and disappearing into the clouds.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
UFO flying away from Boeing Field direction;2010-07-11 20:30:00;15 min;UFO flying away from Boeing Field direction Myself and two people were in my vehicle I turned to get on the ramp to drive onto Interstate I-5 South bound but just as I was driving there where circular objects over the freeway and more circular objects coming from the right direction to the left over the freeway. The right of where we were is over Boeing Field. I didn't drive onto the freeway because these objects were directly over the freeway. The persons in the vehicle with me were telling me to call 911 but what do I say? Officer theres ufo's over the freeway. Just then I sat on the side of the freeway watching these objects for a total of about 13 to 14 minutes. Then once all 13 objects hovered together it looked as though they were making signes in the sky.I called a friend to tell him what I and the other two people were watching. One of the people in my car said another vehicle pulled over behind us and was watching. Once I saw all 13 objects shoot straight into the sky I waited a few minutes to drive because I didn't want to drive under those objects. Once a few minutes went by and I felt ok to drive I got on the freeway Interstate I-5 South as the direction my car was facing, I told the people in the vehicle with me to please keep looking up. Within less then a minute they yelled at the TOP OF THERE LUNGS!!! These 2 object one directly over my car and the other to the left of my car. I yelled at the people in my car to shut up!!!  But they wouldn't stop yelling SO I YELLED SHUT UP AGAIN!!! As I looked up this object was about 20 feet from the top of my car... I was looking at a UFO through my moonroof. Once I got to the next exit there was a SHERIFF driving onto the freeway Interstate I-5 North so I quess there must have been alot of calles to the police station because I heard alot of sirons going off.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
12-20 orange orbs float and fade away seen by 2 witnesses .;2011-09-10 20:20:00;5-7 minutes;12-20 orange orbs float and fade away seen by 2 witnesses . They were orange/red and were all moving together, then slowly faded out. Any pictures I had were rushed and blurry as I had no tripod.  There were about 12-20, with them fading out, and new ones coming in.  They were about behind some tall trees in the night sky.  They were a circle/sphere shape.  There were also two of us who saw it, and we have seen a single one on the 4th of July also.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Non-blinking white spherical-shaped object traveled northwest to southeast - appeared to be a very large meteor falling thru atmosphere;2012-10-19 05:00:00;2 - 3 minutes;Non-blinking white spherical-shaped object traveled northwest to southeast - appeared to be a very large meteor falling thru atmosphere Waiting on the bus, I looked up in the sky, which was partly cloudy with semi-transparent to thicker clouds.  I saw traveling in the sky from the northwest a small white ball.  It did not blink, like an aircraft, and there was no red or green blinking lights.  Just a small circle of light-- large enough to cast a shadow had it been lower in the sky.  It was moving quite fast, but not like a meteor that shoots across the sky.  Faster than a plane â€“ like a meteor in slow motion.  I am fairly certain it was not an airplane.  I am a legal assistant and commute to Seattle every week day.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
4 orange orbs over Everett.  :);2014-07-04 22:00:00;45-60 seconds;4 orange  orbs  over everett :) We were on the deck of our apartment building that faces east I first seen 3 orange lights flyig in a triangle.  I knew what they were my sister has seen them on the east coast I was flipping excited finally I had seen them.   Called for my boyfriend he watched the first 3 go over clear as day then a fourth came trailing behind going slower I think.shortly after all 4 were visible the first 3 disappeared.  We joked their on a field trip to observe our bizarre rituals lol boyfiend went out to the front of our building to see if they went over.   As I watched the last one go to where the others disappeared and im not even kinding it just blinked once then it was gone.  Best 4th ever.  Wish there would be a legit reason for them though.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

At;2017-04-26 23:20:00;5 minutes;Looked up in sky as getting into my car approx. 11:20ish pm noticed 3 different sized orbs in sky over Everett Boeing and westbound.  At first, I thought helicopter, but the bigger one became bigger and intense in light and then faded out a couple of times as well as hovering and moving side to side, pretty staying in one spot.  A smaller one was to the west of the bigger one, doing the same pretty much the same thing and one was farther East but still close and it hovered not like a plane or helicopter........ It was pretty cool!  I asked the bigger one to intensify for me and it did!...then they literally disappeared.....And there were clouds.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Two saucers sited simultaneously in South Everett and North Everett, one heading East, the one to the North heading North.;2017-07-29 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Two saucers sited simultaneously in South Everett and North Everett one heading East the one to the North heading North. I live east of I-5 in South Everett, WA.  I went out to have a cigarette and saw two objects, circular and saucer shaped.  The closest was near 77th St and Broadway slightly higher than small plane at take off in the air.  It was slowly moving eastbound like when a car has slowed to check you out.  The second craft was Northbound and near the Snohomish River Valley, going slowly like the nearer craft. The nearer craft was close enough to be seen clearly.  The sides reflected ambient light.  On the bottom was a single light.  It made no sound and moved smoothly.   I noticed it was not like an airplane because an airplane came by with the typical red and blue light and flashing white light, and it made the typical engine sounds of a small plane. Both craft were bigger than a Cessna.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

Lights in the sky scene from Everett, Washington.;2019-09-11 21:00:00;25 minutes;Lights in the sky scene from Everett, Washington. I noticed three bright lights outside my bedroom window over the Snohomish Valley.  I was looking east.  After 15 minutes I went outside with my phone camera to try to video the lights.   At that point there were only two lights.  I watched as one blinked out, and then a few minutes later the second blinked out.   There was a full moon to the south and the sky was clear enough to see other stars.   There was no noise.  The lights did not move at all, simply hovering in the sky.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
