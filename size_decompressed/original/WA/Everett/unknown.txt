Noticed two illuminated objects high in the South East part of the sky, one was stationary the other moved towards it and positioned it;1998-09-28 16:00:00;1 hour;Noticed two illuminated objects high in the South East part of the sky, one was stationary the other moved towards it and positioned itself below the other, and in about 10 minutes later disappeared in a blue flash, the other remained alone disappeard in a flash and reappeared in a different part of the sky, this happened twice then finally disappeared, it has not been back since. We were standing out in my yard on SUN. 9-28-98 approximately 4:00 on a bright sunny day. We noticed a bright white light moving South fairly fast and high in the atmosphere, towards another white light that was above the other. I called my husband and since we both work for an aerospace company in the area we could tell it was not any type of an aircraft, to be that high, bright and stop so suddenly. The three of us (mother, husband and myself) stood and watched it for about 5 minutes and my mother had to leave, then about 5 minutes later the lower light omitted a blue flash and disappeared in an instant, the other one stayed, and about 10 minutes later it disappeared, but this time i didn't notice the blue flash and reappeared in a different part of the sky, i watched it for another 15 minutes or so and it seemed to disappear into a cloud staying with the cloud as if to move with it, hiding. About 10-15 more minutes it appeared again in a different part of the sky lower this time, and i could see it very well, no clouds, finally it disappeared as if to fade away.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

It seemed too bright to be a star and appeared to be slowly moving west.  As it moved closer, we were able to see about 3 flashing lights that made us think it might be a small plane.  However, the craft seemed to just stop in the sky.  Then my son said it took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared.  Then, once we were closer to home about 10 minutes later (as I was telling my son it was an airplane) I saw about 4 more (the flashing lights made me think they were planes, but then their flight pattern and hovering would say they weren't).  My son then tells me he sees a large one behind a true.  As I'm driving west toward my home, I see an object with three bright round lights (in a row) at about only 25 feet above my house.  As I got closer, it was gone (the darkness made it difficult to see a shape...though you could see there was something definately behind the lights.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

unknown cause of shadow;2003-02-25 12:40:00;1 SEC;unknown cause of shadow At approximately 12:35-12:40 pm, the house was completely shadowed, like an instant eclipse. The whole yard was engulfed in shadow-it's 50 ft by 120 ft. The shy was completely black-I was right by a west facing window. There was no sound, my other half was in the living room-saw the shodow also-immediately went to the east facing window-we have a clear view of the mountains to the west-they're about 40-50 miles away-there was nothing to be seen in the sky-either to the west-south-north. There was absolutely no sound. We have heard planes-we are by the navy base and hear them. The shadow moved from west to east and was incredibly fast. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with these two witnesses at length, and they sounded sincere to us.  We contacted the county sheriff's office and emergency response center, as well as the airport control tower at Paine Field, just south of the location of the event, and we could find no other witness.

Low frequency pulsing sound above house, flash of light and momentary power outage and sound instantly gone;2003-09-14 01:20:00;5 to 7 minutes;Low frequency pulsing sound above house, flash of light and momentary power outage and sound instantly gone Approximately at 1:00 A.M., Sunday morning on Sept 14, 2003 I awoke due to my back bother me and the discomfort of a new bed.  I tried to get comfortable noting that the time was 1:09 A.M.. Laying and looking out of my window I noted the sound of what I thought was a helicopter approaching.  It is not an unusual occurance for medi-vac copters to have a flight path to the Everett Hospital.  The noise which sounded like copter blades creating a pressure wave vibrated my house some what.  The sound increased and then remained over head. There was not a shift in the pitch of the sound indicating movement.  I became somewhat irritated and thought to myself, why arent they moving the helicopter.  My second thought was that if may be a sheriffs dispatched helicopter.  The sound persisted approximately 5 min.  At that point I decided I needed to check out what the source was.  There was then a bright flash that eminated from outside and lit my room up and caused a temporary power outage.  At the same time of the light flash the sound instantly subsided completely going silent.  My electric fan and digital clock powered down and then came back up.  I then jumped from my bed and went to the southern window of my room and was looking east to the alley way and noticed that our alley light was at a low glow.  I assumed that the momentary power outage caused the pud alley light to shut off (or the bright flash trip the optical light sensor).  I then threw on my jeans and went to the front yard (approximately 30 to 45 seconds elapsed from the time of the flash to my being in my front yard).  Standing in my front yard looking up there was no sound, no swooshing noise or low frequency pulsing.  The neighbors dog three houses away was barking.  I returned to my bed room at approx. 1:30.  The next day I enquired of the neighbors if they had heard any unusual noises that morning.  The one neighbor remembered hearing what she thought was sometype of machine and she recalled thinking that she should go and ! check to see what was making the noise but she had her 1 year old grand daughter with her and chose to go back to sleep. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the witness, and he sounds exceptionally credible to us.  PD));47.9229172;-122.2143404
3 orange globes on 4th of July being chased by an airplane?;2009-07-04 23:00:00;10 minutes;3 orange globes on 4th of July being chased by an airplane? Watching fireworks with son and husband.  Saw a strange orange glowing light - at first, thought airplane?   But didn't have those flashing lights - just steady orange glow.  It just felt different - seemed to float, rather than fly.   Then another one appeared right behind it, following same path.  This is when I had to point it out to my son. 2 objects following same path so close together?  The first one suddenly disappeard.  Then, the second did so too, at the exact same point.   Then came the 3rd one - again, exactly the same path (n.e. to s.e.?) and disappeared in the exact same spot.  We thought, clouds covering them?  But then we saw an airplane - blinking lights - like you'd expect from a regular airplane - it followed the same path, too.  But, it didn't disappear like the 3 orange globes, so we know they didn't go into the clouds.   What in the heck was that?  Did other people see this?  I live on Hilton Lake in Everett, Wa.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
GREEN BEAM OF LIGHT OVER EVERETT WASHINGTON;2010-02-28 23:00:00;unknown;GREEN BEAM OF LIGHT OVER EVERETT WASHINGTON My daughter and her boyfriend were driving home they saw a beam of green light that was shining behind them, it lit up the inside of the car then shined on the stop sign in the neighborhood they drove in. they looked around to see where it was coming from then it zig zagged away shining about a mile away onto Providence hospital, the sky was clear they said accept for one dingy dark cloud. they decided to drive toward the hospital to see if they could find out where it was coming from then it quickly bounced back suddenly behind them and it stopped, the beam was shinimg from above and it scared them. It was impossible for it to have been done bu a person, all probabilites have been excluded trying to figure it out. they drove off quickly and it vanished.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
White star like object darts acrossed sky and suddenly stops, but doesn't disappear.;2010-08-17 20:30:00;2-5 minutes;White star like object darts acrossed sky and suddenly stops, but doesn't disappear. So roughly between 8:30pm and 9:00pm Pacific Time, the sun was setting, but the sky was still bright blue. To the south, southwest I could see the moon.  Sitting in a chair facing south I tilted my head back to look at the sky.  I saw a noticeably bright white star, I thought at first it must be a plane... so I watched it for a few and then it suddenly moved very very swiftly in the north direction and stopped very abruptly.   My second thought was a meteor, after all we did just have a meteor shower this past weekend, but the very bright star never disappeared or burned out like a shooting star would have and it stayed in the same spot and just as bright until I mentioned it to friends who were also present at the time.  They shrugged it off and said satellite I quickly dismissed this option because of how quickly it moved and stopped. Don't satellites stay in continuous motion in orbit around the earth??  Wouldn't that make them move very slowly across the sky?  And would they be as bright as the moon in blue sky?   I'm not sure if this is the same or similar thing people around the world have seen lately, but it sure does make you wonder.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

Its blue red and white.  It was pretty low when I first spotted it.  I know I can't be the only person that seen this craft.  Planes fly by everyday I know it wasn't a plane.  Its pretty high in the sky time now but you can still see the color change.  The blue red and white is ofcourse flashing lights.  It was around 23:40 and it is now 00:42.  Its generally in the same area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));47.9229172;-122.2143404
5 red/orange lights moving fast from the NE to the SW over Everett.;2012-07-04 23:30:00;5 minutes;5 red/orange lights moving fast from the NE to the SW over Everett. My wife and I were on a walk after watching fireworks and we saw 5 fireballs traveling from NE to SW.  They had a red/orange light that flickered but we couldn't see any smoke or hear the objects.  They were moving very fast and eventually disappeared out of sight to the SE.   We couldn't find anything online about it.  If anyone has any insight please share. They seemed to be traveling like missiles and we speculated that something could have been fired from a ship near the Naval base in Everett. But, obviously that is purely speculation.   Thanks.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Witnessed and bright white light floating along in the night sky, no noise at all.  Second sighting in a couple days;2013-08-07 10:15:00;2 minutes;Witnessed and bright white light floating along in the night sky, no noise at all.  Second sighting in a couple days So the other night I saw this exact same thing fly overhead while leaving to give a friend a ride home, and I saw it again tonight while out having a smoke.  Except it seemed to float more than fly...  I just saw it again tonight heading somewhat the same direction. NE, from Everett, WA.  It's super bright like a star almost, but it's moving.  I actually snapped a couple picts before it floated away.  The video I tried to take didn't come out. I'm not crazy and I witnessed an airplane a minute after seeing this.  Airplanes lights blink or are green and red, and they usually make noise and the plane was flying a lot faster not merely floating along.  This thing seemed weird and out of place, and I can't believe I saw it again tonight.  Wtf is goin on up there?  The pict of the light I took seems transparent almost.  Approx 1000 feet up.  Flew SW to NE towards Lake Stevens.  Orb of bright white light.  Clear night sky.  I have 3  picts I can text.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Massive craft slowly moving away from my position.;2013-11-21 21:10:00;30 seconds;Massive craft slowly moving away from my position. I was walking out to my car tonight to go get dinner around 9:10PM.  I always stop and take a good 360 degree look at the stars when we get beautiful clear nights like tonight.   To my northwest maybe two miles away I noticed 2 flashing red lights that where approximately a quarter mile or so apart from each other.  I also noticed that they were blinking in unison.  This would not have been anything strange, except for the fact that they were slowly moving away from me at a very low altitude (maybe 1500-2000 feet), and that they moved in perfect unison together which lead me to believe these two blinking red lights were connected to ONE craft!  It was very slowly traveling away from me.  Slower than conventional aircraft fly.   Judging by the distance between the two red lights, this thing must have been massive!!  I also get the feeling it maybe have been triangle shaped and I was seeing the rear part of the craft.  But there was no visible propulsion systems and no noise.   It traveled in a northwest course towards the Puget Sound.   I work in aerospace building modern day commercial planes.  I have never seen anything that large, that flies like what I saw tonight.  It was so big I'm just hoping someone else in this area got video or a better view of the craft.   It's no secret anymore with the number of sightings on the rise.   My newly changed opinion is we are not alone on this little planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.9229172;-122.2143404
