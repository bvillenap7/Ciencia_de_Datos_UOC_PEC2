On Friday, June 24, 2011 at approximately 3 PM, I was travelling West on the Boeing Freeway on-ramp in Everett, WA near 19th Ave.  I glanced to my right so I was looking in the sky to the Northeast in the approximate direction of Darrington. In the sky at roughly a 35 degree angle to the horizon, I observed a light brown cube approximately the size of a sugar-cube, or dime, at arm's length. I assumed the object was some kind of balloon.  However, although the weather was extremely unsettled, a mix of storm-clouds and sunshine, the cube did not appear to move. The surface of the cube appeared very smooth almost like it was coated with vinyl. However, there was no shine or reflection off the surface of the object. The object was stationary, at the edge of some storm clouds, and it seemed likely they would shortly close around it.  I had to watch my driving and quickly lost sight of the object, because the highway swung so that the object was now directly behind me. Total time of the sighting was probably 10-15 seconds. Because the storm clouds had edged around the object, I know it was in the sky and not an outdoor light fixture, etc., giving the appearance of an object.  It was also like nothing I had ever seen, or expected to see. This is my first unknown sighting. I'm 64 years old, in good health and not seeking publicity. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else in Northwestern Washington State observed anything similar to this.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
