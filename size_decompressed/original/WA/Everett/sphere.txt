Mysterious orb floating fifty or so yards above me in the evening sky;1998-08-15 19:00:00;20 min;Mysterious orb floating fifty or so yards above me in the evening sky I was returning to the pizza shop from a delivery, walking from my car I looked up for some reason. To my amazement there appeared to be a black or metallic orb floating about 50 yards above me.It made no sound. The orb stayed stationary in the air.I watched it as long as I could before my next delivery. When I got back,(approx. 15-20 min)it was gone.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Red, blue, and green lights, in one sphere shaped object.;2003-10-18 11:15:00;30 seconds;Red, blue, and green lights, in one sphere shaped object. I heard a weird humming sound, and got up. I pulled up the drapes and then I saw red, green, and blue lights. The shape was like a sphere. The objects were moving faster then most planes. There was only one object. ((NUFORC Note:  Some inconsistency in the report.  We wonder whether this report is a serious one.  PD));47.9229172;-122.2143404
Slow moving flashing red, blue and white light(Flying cop car???);2009-01-19 01:52:00;2 hrs;Slow moving flashing red, blue and white light (Flying cop car???) Numerous people witnessed a flashing blue, white and red object west over Port Gardner for an extended period of time.  Object was moving very slowly in a northerly direction.  It is still visible in the sky as of this writing.  No obvious change in altitude.  Viewed through binoculars and night vison goggles.  Distinct blue, green and sweeping white light on top.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Blood red firey UFO moving easterly past the moon vanishing with a red streak.;2009-07-04 00:45:00;2 minutes;Blood red firey UFO moving easterly past the moon vanishing with a red streak. My Girlfriend and I witnessed what we thought was a Japanese Lantern but it seemed to move very quickly and moved vertically, up and down, while strafing left (east) past the moon. It was a blood red object, seemingly on fire, yet as it moved past the moon it grew dimmer. Then it vanished with a quick tracer back towards the upper skyline back towards the west. It was a unique event to witness. It being the 4th of July now I suspected it to be a lantern but it's speed, movement, and swiftness led me to believe it was a UFO. It wasn't a flare, plane, balloon, nor meteor. Therefore it's just classified as a UFO.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
13 bright orange sphere shaped lights moving through my neighborhood, two at time side by side;2013-08-02 21:31:00;5 minutes;13 bright orange sphere shaped lights moving through my neighborhood, two at time side by side I happened to glance out my kitchen window while doing dishes which faces west towards the water (Port Gardner Bay) Everett Washington.  Approaching my house I see two distinct fire orange balls of light that appeared to be in tandem with each other.  They moved through the section of tree line that divides my neighborhood from the bluff and then appear to fly through the tree line heading away from my street in an easterly direction, as they cleared the trees, and in plain view of open cloudless sky they just disappeared.  Seconds later two more approach mimicking the same pattern, they flew approximately two blocks west of my home down the street. They got smaller and I assumed they were either going higher or disappearing all together because I was unable to visualize them when at the end of the street.  As the two balls of light disappeared two more are moving past the tree line, again following the same pattern.  I was able to get my neighbor’s visitor’s attention and he confirmed what I was seeing.  I was able to see a few small commuter airplanes in the distance that is typical of this area as I am close to Boeing and a few miles from the Everett Naval Station.  These lights were not typical of the aircraft I have seen here. There was no sound to them they didn’t leave any sort of trail.  However, I counted 13 of them, they flew in pairs except for the last one, and all followed the same flight pattern.  This process took approximately 5 minutes, unfortunately for fear of missing anything I did not run back to my house and get my camera.  I only had the comfort of my neighbor’s friend who was able to see what I saw. I am providing this information because this is the second sighting I have had, the first was May 3, 2012 and that one was just a singular orange light that hovered directly over my home for approximately 3min, it was also 9-9:30 in the evening.  That sighting was much closer to my house and directly above it.  It also appeared to illuminate itself to appear really big and then shrink in size and look like a tiny white star.  It disappeared when I attempted to jump the shrubbery in my front yard and bang on the window to get my husband’s attention.  I made a search of the neighborhood seconds after I lost sight of that one and walked to the bluff which overlooks the water, Port Gardner Bay, but there was no indication of it anywhere in the sky. I do not believe these were airplanes, helicopters, weather balloons or flares.  These objects had intelligent and deliberate movement and seemed to be a team or in unison of some sort.  I am hesitant to contact the Naval Station and inquire about any sightings on the evening of August 2nd 2013 or possible unusual things seen on their radar as these types of occurrences are typically dismissed, so I decided to share it with you to see if this sounds like anything you have heard before.  I am sincerely interested since I live above the Naval Station and not far from the water.  Is their a correlation for the multiple sightings?  I don’t know, however what I saw was absolutely amazing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.9229172;-122.2143404
Yellow/Orange orb traveling at a high rate of speed silently East to West Snohomish County, WA.;2016-04-29 23:30:00;Seconds;Yellow/Orange orb traveling at a high rate of speed silently East to West Snohomish County, WA. I've recently gotten into my new telescope and with the break in the weather I wanted to go look up at the stars.   While I was in my backyard looking up this small orange/yellow orb like object without any sound went whizzing by from east to west in a very fast way and I lost it in the trees and could no longer follow it.  It was low enough where I could tell it was NOT a satellite.   Paine Field airport where one of the Boeing plants are located is due west of me and corresponds with other sitings listed here. After reading some of the other local reports around the same timeline it leads me to think there is a direct connection with their views and observations.  I REALLY wanted to see more. I'm a private pilot and have never witnessed anything like this before.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
2 triangle sphere shaped bright orange objects flying under 500ft across Sivler Lake Wa;2016-07-04 22:40:00;7 minutes;2 triangle sphere shaped bright orange objects flying under 500ft across Sivler Lake Wa Did anyone else see at least 2 fluorescnet or bright orange boomerang/sphere shaped objects float directly across Silver Lake in SE fashion - Everett WA?  They were both very quiet - my first impression of 1st object was a drone, but wondered why it was so bright??  when I saw the 2nd one about 3min later I was wondering if it was a flare?  which didn't seem right either... both objects were eerily quiet, very small and flying under 500ft.  Both certainly had a purpose, on a mission - like it was documenting our fireworks displays...?;47.9229172;-122.2143404
