A intensive bright red light moving extremely slow and silent.;1999-05-08 23:30:00;10 minutes;A intensive bright red light moving extremely slow and silent. I was staring up at stars when suddenly appeared a bright red light in the Western sky close to Colby Avenue near downtown Everett.  It was moving slowly and heading S.E. towards City of Snohomish.  The object was engulfed in this intense red light which was at an altitude of approximetely 500 feet and 20 feet in diameter.  Even as it was overhead my husband and I were still unable to hear any sound.  We tried looking through a pair of binoculars, but all I was able to see was the bright red light. Once it was beyond our house and over Ebbey Island it started to gain altitude and disappeared into the clouds.  I watched until I couldn't see the glowing red light from behind the clouds any longer.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
I watched a streak of light move in a southerly direction heading downward eventually disappearing behind the Olympic Mountains.;1999-09-25 19:15:00;3-5 minutes;I watched a streak of light move in a southerly direction heading downward eventually disappearing behind the Olympic Mountains. I live on the bluff above the North Everett waterfront.  This evening I had a clear view of the south end of Whidbey Island and the Olympic Mountains behind.  I was watching the sky from my window and saw a streak of light that appeared to be moving very slowly at an angle of 25-35 degrees in a southerly direction.  I looked at it through my 8X binoculars, when I first saw the streak and it was near the middle of the field of view with the lower edge of the field on the water/Whidbey Island edge. (I don't know if that is helpful - it's a way to locate raptors for birdwatchers.) I was able to watch the streak through my spotting scope which has a zoom lens 20X to 50X, and it looked like dense orange burning gasses getting less dense toward the end, but not fading very much.  I could see no object associated with this streak of light, just the look of roiling, burning gasses.  It did not leave a trail as it moved, but moved as one entity.  As the streak was moving toward then behind the mountains, it passed an adjacent mountain peak, possibly Mt. Olympus.  The streak was about 2/3 the size of the silouetted slope of that mountain peak, so it must have been very large.  Mt. Olympus is about 70-80 miles away as the crow flies from Everett.  I am not sure about the length of time of the observation, but I had time to get my binoculars across the room, watch through my binoculars for a short while, go across the room, get my spotting scope set up, find the streak in my scope, which took a little while because I could no longer see it with my naked eye and had to check again with my binoculars to get a location, and watched the streak until it went behind the mountains.  I work for Snohomish County Surface Water Management as a watershed steward for the Snohomish River basin.  I have never seen anything like this before.  One more thing, it probably moving westerly as well since at first I could see it without optics, then it must have gotten farther away since I could only find it again by using my binoculars.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

It grew brighter and seemed to change course slightly. One clear Sunday evening I was in our backyard looking at the stars.  I noticed a light moving through the sky just above constellation Orion.  I thought it was a satelite in orbit moving North and slightly West.  While I watched it suddenly grew brighter and it's trajectory seemed to swing slightly more to the West.  I lost sight of it when it went behind some trees.  I moved about 200 feet North to the other side of the copse of trees but could not find it again.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

Triangle formation of faint lights moving south.;2000-09-24 20:40:00;5 min;Triangle formation of faint lights moving south. Sunday evening I was stargazing in my backyard.  I was seated in a lawn chair facing east.  I thought detected some motion about 60 degrees above the eastern horizon.  Through my binoculars I was able to discern three steady, faint lights moving in a southerly direction. The speed seemed to be faster than most high-altitude aircraft, about the speed of a LEO satelite.  The lights were fixed in a triangle formation.  No sound was heard.  No strobes or other navigational lights were seen.  They were barely visible with the naked eye.  When viewed through 7x35 binoculars the formation occupied about 1/3 of the field of view.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

The first object shot back disappearing into the sky then the larger object went after it. The first object was going so fast it seemed to leave a trail. The larger object did not leave a trail and did not seem to go as fast. My heart was pounding this was my first sighting of a UFO. Did anyone in the Seattle area see anything? I have done a little research after this experience and there have been a lot of sightings in the Seattle area.  What's going on? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I live in Everett, Washington. In the summer of 2004 i walked outside of my house around 11:00pm. From the front of my house i can see north, overlooking north Everett waterfront and Marysville.  I was standing outside looking north when i saw a light hovering maybe 500 feet above downtown Marysville.  The light started to get brighter and brighter and illuminated all of marysville and the cascade mountains. I would guess it illuminated at least 50 sq miles for about 1 minute.  The light was brighter than daylight. After the one minute of illumination it went off and everything was normal and dark like it should be.  I was amazed at how good i could see almost every detail of the cityscape and the surrounding cities and mountains.

Have you seen an orange ball of light bouncing through the sky?;2004-07-26 22:38:00;3 minutes;Have you seen an orange ball of light bouncing through the sky? While lying in bed talking with witness #2, I stood up to get my soda from the windowsill.  Immediately noticed an orange ball of light in the southeast night sky.  Wondered out loud What's that.  Two of us watch for about 5 seconds and ask eachother Is it bouncing.  We both look away and blink.  We look back to determine the following: 1.Based on my estimation of height and distance (not sure what these measurements would be, but it's low and not very far away), the object looks to be about the size of a large SUV or van.  2.If there was a sound to be heard, the conditions were perfect clear skies, no wind, very calm.  However, we heard nothing.  3.It's moving from east to west.  4.Strangest of all, it appears to be bouncing.  That is, moving up and down with short, quick movements while horizontal speed is slow to stop. Speed changes are eratic. Almost seems like we're watching a living creature.  After about 1 minute, I removed the window screen and climbed out onto the garage roof for the best possible view.  Watched object continue west (again, bouncing with variable rate of speed) for another 2 minutes until it became obscured by neighborhood trees.  I'll add here that I am an avid sky watcher and am quite familiar with aircraft types and air traffic patterns.  This one just didn't match up with anything I'd seen before.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

I went out about 1845 and noticed a satilitte moving across the sky moving from south to north, I thought that was strange, I wasnt sure if satilites moved in the direction. I figured that they must and went in and forgot about it. About 30min. later I heard some people outside and decided to check it out. I watched the children that were making the noise and before going inside I looked up and noticed another similar light moving in the same direction but it was a little further west than before. As I watched it I saw it go from a south-to-north direction, into a more norteastern direction, but it was soon evident that the object wasnt moving northeastern, it was gaining altitude. It only lasted a few seconds before it dissapeered into the sky going almost straight up. The light was the same color as the rest of the stars and about the same intensity as the most intense stars.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

At first I thought oh a satillite and continued to track it since satillites travel only in one direction, but all of a sudden the star like object stopped, and reversed slowly for 30 seconds and stopped again and the faint star started to light up the sky into a oval glow and out shined the other stars in the area and flew out to outer space very fast, afterwards a orb like object followed it out too. It was fasicinating and eerie.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

A bright yellowish light over the I-5 freeway in Western Washington.;2007-10-02 02:00:00;20min - 30min;A bright yellowish light over the I-5 freeway in Western Washington. This sighting occurred at about 2:00am during the first week of October 2007 while I was visiting my parents in Washington State.  I had just gotten off the phone with my fiancé and was settling down to read myself to sleep on the fold-out bed in the living room.  I was lying on my stomach, absorbed in my book, when a strange feeling of something being amiss suddenly washed over me.  I can't really explain the feeling better than that it simply seemed as though something was not quite right. I looked out of the open window, which was directly in front of me at the head of the bed.  This window faces east and overlooks a high school football field at the bottom of the hill that my parents' house sits on.  Beyond the field lies Broadway Ave. and a section of I-5, and beyond that one has a view of the countryside, the small town of Snohomish, and the Cascade Mountains way off in the distance. Peering out the window, I didn't see or hear anything unusual, just some cars zipping along the freeway and a few lights dotting the foothills of the Cascades.  I shook my head and silently scolded myself for being silly and went back to my book.  After a few moments I glanced out the window again and saw a light in the sky off in the distance.  This light was quite bright and seemed to shift colors it went back and forth very slowly between muddy yellow and pale orange.  I assumed it was just a helicopter checking out the traffic on the freeway, but I kept watching it anyway.  It stayed in one spot, not moving at all, and I suddenly realised that it couldn't be a helicopter, at least not any kind of helicopter I'm familiar with.  The light it was giving off was all wrong.  What's more, I couldn't hear a thing other than the windchimes on the porch and the traffic on the roads.  Sounds carry very well in that part of the state, and had it been any kind of conventional aircraft I'm certain that I would have been able to hear and identify it. I turned off the lamp next to my bed and lay in the dark watching the light.  It hovered over I-5 for about 10 minutes, then drifted slowly to the south, along the line of the freeway, and was concealed by a stand of pine trees about 500 feet from the house.  I figured it had gone away, but I stayed in the dark and continued to look out the window.  Another 5 minutes passed, and the light suddenly reappeared from behind the trees.  It moved north and took up its former position over the road and just hovered there, not doing much of anything that I could see.  It stayed in that spot for about 5 to 10 minutes. I started to feel uneasy I squeezed my eyes shut, lowered my head, and counted to ten.  When I glanced out of the window again the light was gone.  I looked all over the sky but there wasn't a trace of it anywhere. I waited for a bit to see if it would come back, but it never did.  Finally I turned the lamp on and picked up my book, eventually falling asleep sometime around 3:00am.  Nothing else of note happened the rest of the time I was visiting. I would like to note that I did not feel at all threatened by this light, and if it was a UFO I very much doubt that the intentions of the pilots were hostile in any way.  I have the feeling that whoever, if anyone, was inside this craft was simply interested in seeing what the freeway was all about.  I did feel uneasy, as I said, but this mostly because I was faced with something strange, something I could not explain. I have been sitting on this story for a year, too embarrassed to tell it to anyone aside from my fiancé.  I am above all else a realist, and when I see something strange I like to exhaust all mundane explanations before I label the experience paranormal.  I have been very intrigued the UFO phenomenon for years, though, and I firmly believe that our vast universe is capable of supporting life on distant planets.  Why those lifeforms should be interested in visiting Earth is beyond me, but as long as they're not engaging in harmful activities, I say the more the merrier.

Disappearing bright light over Smith Island in Everett, WA;2008-05-05 23:10:00;1 minute;Disappearing bright light over Smith Island in Everett, WA At 11:10 pm after work on Smith Island I was talking to a co-worker when I saw a bright light west, high in the sky. I thought it was Venus but it was brighter... My coworker must have looked up too, because after it disappeared he said, Whoa, was that some kind of spy-plane?. We both discussed it. Because it was not a plane nor a helicopter because there were no blinking beacon or wing tip lights. There was also no noise! The light simply was very bright and just disappeared!  The sky was clear with few clouds scattered about. We are both truck drivers that work swing. And he, as well as I, know the position of lights on airplanes. Red is port and green is Starbird. And every plane,as far as I know, has a blinking beacon on its belly. I myself, use to work on airplanes at Tramco, at Paine Field for six years......;47.9229172;-122.2143404
I noticed 3 bright lights in the ski moving to fast to be normal aircrafts.   ((NUFORC Note:  ISS?  PD));2009-07-24 23:00:00;5 min;I noticed 3 bright lights in the ski moving to fast to be normal aircrafts. Ok what I saw was really weird. I never saw anything like it before. It was about 11pm, and warm outside.  I was taking my dog out to do her business and also taking the trash out. As I was walking down my apartment stairs I noticed 3 bright lights in the ski.  One was standing still, one was moving to the left, and the other was coming straight for me or more like over my apartment. At first I didn’t think anything of it because I live by Boeing airfield in Everett. Then I noticed that the one that was coming towards me was really bright, kind of like the north star that those guys where following to find Jesus, but this was no star I promise you that. I also noticed it had no other lights like a regular aircraft. No red, green, or blue lights that usually flash on a plane or helicopter, the other two where the same. I was more focused on the one coming closer to me, because I could see it so clearly. I also noticed it was flying lower than a plane. Planes from Boeing don’t take off over my apartment ever, and they never get that close to our apartment like that. There was also no sound. You would defiantly hear noise if it was that close. Now when I say close, I don’t mean hit my house close but it was to close for a normal plane, and if it was a helicopter I would have heard it. Then also as it got closer I noticed it was swinging side to side, kind of like how if you hold up a necklace and it swings side to side. By now I was getting a little excited because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Then I quickly looked at the one moving to the left and it was moving at the same speed, and it looked the same. It was just farther away. The third one was higher and standing still, but I am not sure if it was the space station or not. I don’t know exactly where it is in the ski, but I never noticed it there before until last night. Then I decided to run in my house, and go on the deck to watch the one that was coming towards me pass over my house, but as I got there, nothing came over. It was just gone. If it was a real plane it should have come right over my apartment, and past right in front of my deck. But it didn’t. Then I ran back out to see if I could see the other one and it was gone. The only one left was the one that was standing still. I am going to go back out tonight to see if I can see the one that was standing still, and if I can then it was just the space station. The other two where nothing like what I have ever seen before. I am still in shock. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Red Glowing Light viewed in Western Washington;2010-06-25 21:45:00;5 minutes;Red Glowing Light viewed in Western Washington On the evening of June 25th, 2010 my sister, daughter and I were driving south on our way home from an evening of shopping.  It was about 9:45pm.  I was driving and we were all admiring the full moon. I noticed a red light in the sky at a 5 o’clock position from the moon.  I thought it might be a planet and asked them that.  It was about the size of the North Star when it first appears in the night sky.  My daughter said if it was a planet it would be Mars because of the color.  We were all looking at it and noticed that it was not steady in the sky and was pulsing slightly.  It was not moving in big movements but steady, like when a helicopter is trying to stay stationary. As we were watching it trying to figure out what it was its glow changed in size and its color was a vibrant red glow.  It increased over 20% of its original size and continued pulsing.  I asked my sister to get her camera out of her purse so we could get some video of it.  As she was getting it out of her purse it decreased in size and went to how it was before. I turned off the road I was on and traveled down a residential road with my hand out the driver’s side window taking video of the object.  I had to stop when a car came up behind me.  I turned towards home and that is when my daughter said that it is gone.   When we pulled into our driveway I went to search the sky to see if there were any planes or anything, but nothing was there.  Just the full moon. I don’t know what we saw, but I know it is nothing I have ever viewed in the night sky before. From the time I first noticed it to the time it vanished was close to 5 minutes. I will get the video from my sister as soon as she returns from vacation and send it in.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

There was a thick cloud cover that night so the object obviously wasn’t a satellite or the light from a plane because it was below the cloud cover.  It was about 10X the size a star would appear.  We all watched as it moved steadily toward the south before disappearing over the trees to the south. Just as the first light moved out of sight, the second one appeared.  It moved the same speed and direction as the first one before disappearing over the tree tops.  Each one took about a minute and a half to two minutes to move across the sky.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

Was thinking it was a planet before it started changing. Two for my friends saw it as well. Less than a minute later the light dimmed slowly and moved very slowly closer to the ground and to the right then went out of sight. I know it wasn't a plane.

a UFO moving across the sky out of a formation making a u turn and heading back in the direction from which it came at a high rate of s;2012-05-13 22:25:00;15 sec;a UFO moving across the sky out of a formation making a u turn and heading back in the direction from which it came at a high rate of s My brother and I were sitting in his backyard around a fire, he looked up and made a joke about geese flying low, as there had been a UFO report many years ago in NYC that I had seen from the roof of my midtown apartment that turned out to be geese.  I looked up and saw a redish light about the size of a star moving very fast from WSW and then make a sweeping u turn and head back the direction from which it came.  There was a jet in the sky at the same time, so it was easy to judge the speed as being easily five or six times faster thn the plane.  When I first saw it I thought it must be a satellite, but then it made that u turn and headed in the opposite direction at an amazing rate of speed.  This is the first time I've seen a UFO.  I'm 54, an actor in NYC visiting my family here in Everett.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Huge red glowing light east of Everett WA makes 90 degree turn and moves toward  Snohomish as seen by Ebey Island resident.;2013-09-01 22:15:00;1 minute?;huge red glowing light east of Everett WA makes 90 degree turn and moves toward  Snohomish as seen by Ebey Island resident I'm a semi retired senior woman living on Ebey Island just north of the Highway 2 tressel east of Everett WA.  At about 22:15, Sept 1, 2013, a glowing light was seen coming from the north east.  Its appearance caused me to imagine a burning small private aircraft.  I expected it to burnout and crash near me, but instead, it did a 90 degree turn nearly directly over me and proceeded south east towards Snohomish.    It was absolutly silent and as it moved into the low lying cloud it lit up the cloud formation.   The glowing light was red and seemed to have a pulsating aura around it. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Harvey Field had no knowledge, but gave me the Arial Baloon Co contact number.  All of their balloons that day were accounted for and landed before dark, at least by 20:30.  I left two messages with the Hearld Newspaper- awaiting a reply.   Thanks.   ((END ADDENDUM));47.9229172;-122.2143404
Helicopters investigate red lights hovering over everett, and Snohomish, WA.;2014-07-26 23:00:00;For hours;Helicopters investigate red lights hovering over everett, and snohomish WA Standing on my front porch, looking east a formation of red lights, three of them, formed a line over as though they were moving together.   It was the shape of a saucer and it hovered and blinked as more red lights showed up in the sky just a short distance away.  As we were watching multiple white lights in triangle formation popped up out of nowhere.   They hovered as the sounds of thunder echoed through the sky yet there were no clouds no lightening, the booming sounds continued for ten minutes consecutively every 30 seconds.   There were no flashes in the sky until the sounds were done then randomly they started to light up the sky.   As the sounds stopped the lights continued to flash in a pattern and we could hear helicopters and see their flashing lights as they seemed to investigate the red lights.   After all this in the dense wooded area one of the red lights landed on the ground and pulsated for some time until disappearing.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
A large, bright orange light moving across the clear sky;2015-04-25 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;A large, bright orange light moving across the clear sky I walked outside and my sight was immediately drawn to a bright orange light moving across the sky.  It was a clear night no clouds and all the stars were bright, I at first thought it was an aircraft that had caught fire it was that orange, large and bright.   It disappeared after about 2- min after I saw it.   I am a 47yo Freelance artist with a degree.   I witnessed circular lights over South Mountain in AZ 24 years ago, aside from these two incidents I have never encountered anything I was unable to rationalize.  It did not make me nervous or excited, just curious.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Two unknown bright lights.;2015-09-14 06:00:00;50 minutes;Two unknown bright lights. On the morning of 9/14/2015 @ 6:00am, I let my cat out (which I do every morning), I looked directly toward the eastern sky, towards a well known plane manufacture co. I saw a very bright light (directly above this plane manufacturing co.) that did not move, and up a little higher and more south east, there was another bright light, slowly moving upwards.  At first I thought it was stars, since it was still a little dark outside, but the sky was clear, except just below the first bright light,  was a chem trail or should I say exhaust trail from a previous plane. So I asked my boyfriend to come an check this out. He took a look at both bright  lights, got frightened an ran back inside.  I then grabbed my tablet, and video taped what I had seen. When I zoomed on the light, it was illuminating, throwing off different colors.  My boyfriend described it as looking as if the light was vibrating. For some reason I could not film the second light on my video, while the first light did not move, the second one was climbing upwards. I had to go inside to get ready for work, when we left around 6:50, both lights were gone. Later that day I told my father about it, he said he seen the same first bright light that I had, he also says he does not known what it was.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Orbs over the Snohomish Valley in July, again!;2016-07-19 00:05:00;6 minutes;Orbs over the Snohomish Valley in July, again! I was standing at my kitchen sink just after midnight.  When a light appeared due east of Silver Lake over the valley between Snohomish & Clearview.  It moved silently to the southwest.  No strobes or navigational lights were observed.  It was a windless night & the object moved at about the speed of a small airplane, except it was changing altitude very slightly up & down. I lost sight of it behind some trees.  A minute or so later another one appeared & traveled in an identical manner.  By the time the third one appeared I had gone outside to observe the same behavior.  The lights had a slight orange hue.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
Strange diagonal line of light;2016-10-19 07:35:00;3 minutes;Strange diagonal line of light Oct 19, 2016 7:35-7:38 AM Was driving east on 132nd towards Seattle Hill Rd on my way to Snohomish. Noticed a very bright diagonal line of light higher then cloud level.  The line of light was moving down diagonally (west) towards the horizon at what seemed like a steady and fast rate.  I took 4 photos of it from within my car, through my windshield.  I called my husband at home to see if he could see it from his location too, but it was moving down so quickly that by the time our 3 min call ended it had moved below the tree line and out of sight. When the photos are zoomed into, there are grey objects near or in the light.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

She noticed a light somewhat high in the sky that was moving.  We observed that it was not a plane as a plane is usually distinguished by its flashing lights.  Planes were also in the vicinity.   It disappeared for approximately 5 minutes.  We thought it was because clouds had come through.  The sky opened and the stars were visible again.  However, it reappeared and moved in a zig-zag type pattern across the sky.  It clearly had a trajectory that went west of our complex.   I wondered if it was a drone, but why would drones be used late in the evening.  There was no sound from this object.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

The crescent moon was in the western horizon.  We saw the lights  and thought they might be planets at first.  Then, we thought they were airplanes but they were not moving and did not have any red lights flashing.   One appeared suddenly, to make three lights, just as we turned north up a street. and then after a couple minutes the third light disappeared.  Then another disappeared, leaving only one.  The third disappeared and seemed to have moved up and to the right (south) at an angle that faded quickly sort of like smoke trailing.   We were in our car driving in the town so it was hard to see exactly what was going on.  This is our first sighting.  Pretty amazing.  Might have made a triangle, but they were close together as a group, but never crossing paths or touching.;47.9229172;-122.2143404

Triangle formation of twinkling lights;2021-04-27 20:15:00;15 minutes;Triangle formation of twinkling lights I was driving south in interstate 5 (I-5) by Dagmars boat yard south of Marysville when I saw three bright lights in front of the cloud cover in triangle formation. Ii was huge but they were separate craft. By the time I got to Everett they had spread apart further. One was over Snohomish area east of Everett, another was west over Boeing, the third was south west of Everett, it was difficult for me to follow and see these while driving. They were very bright and twinkling cycling red white and blue.  They seemed higher in the sky but they seemed lower the closer I got to them maybe 500 feet in the air at the lowest point.;47.9229172;-122.2143404
