sighting years ago in WA;1987-06-01 03:00:00;5 minutes;sighting years ago in WA My friends and I stopped at a stop sign in a neighborhood. As I looked up hovering above and somewhat in between the trees was this UFO. My friends saw this and the object was so unreal that all 4 of us got out of the car and were staring and screaming and saying oh my god, oh my god in the middle of the road. The object was probably about 15 feet above us in the trees. The front of it was domed shaped all clear, inside were to men with masks that had long tubes hanging in front of them. Their faces were un-identifiable due to the dark masks.  The men were staring at us and spoke to us but it was very muffled so we couldn't understand them. The object made NO engine noise at all, it was completely silent. We were so freaked out and one of the girls was crying so we got back in our car and drove away. It was reported to the local newspaper and apparently there had been other calls made about it too. Now, we do live very close to Fort Lewis, among a few other military bases, so perhaps it was a military craft but the fact that it made absolutely no sound was beyond our belief. We did not receive any burns on our body, nor did the trees seem to be affected.  Our car started right up so I can't imagine that there was radiation. That's my story, and its rarely discussed because we were made fun of when we talked about it.  I would be interested if there were any other reports similar to this in the time range.
