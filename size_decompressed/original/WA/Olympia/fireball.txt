Fireball object in Puget Sound Area;1997-11-14 21:30:00;30 seconds;Fireball object in Puget Sound Area this is in reference to sighting http://www.ufocenter.com/S2874.html I belive I saw the very same thing. I was in my living room with a window that faced north across lake Offut south of Olympia. The lights were on inside so the object was bright enough to be seen though the window of a fully light house. The object travel from West to East at a somewhat downward angle. It appeared to be at a great distance as the object moved slowly accross the sky. I was able to go to a second room with windows facing the same direction and wake up my roomate who was sleeping so that she could see the same thing. She verfified the sighting. It was a fireball with trailing debris, moving slowly, orange in color. KIRO news reported that evening that it had been a russian space craft that was being tracked by Norad an re-entered north of Vancover BC. Later that Evening I noticed a lot of air traffic in that direction, but a military base was close by.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626

Giant flaming ball crept across horizon.;2013-05-21 21:45:00;3 minutes;Giant flaming ball crept across horizon. We saw a large orb floating across the sky very slowly (or quickly for how high up is was). we watched for three to five minutes, we even had time to wake up our housemates to come check it out.  thru binoculars it appeared to be a giant ball of fire.  it moved all the way across the horizon then burned out or disappeared.  When looking at it just with our eyes it would bump up in down.  it must have been bumping up and down a pretty big distance because across the sky it would jump either a few inches up or down.  It covered the entire horizon i can see in a matter of minutes so it had to be going super fast.  i saw it begin at the port of olympia, and it went north following budd inlet towards and past boston harbour and burfoot park towards tacoma.  what was this thing??  there was also a plane going super quickly much much lower than the weird fire ball moving across the sky. the plane appeared to be moving much quicker than the fire thing, which is! crazy because the fire ball was going super fast to begin with.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
