Large orange illuminated sphere groming in size,stationary, just above treeline next to roadway.;1981-06-20 23:00:00;4 min;Large orange illuminated sphere groming in size,stationary, just above treeline next to roadway. Witnessed a very large Orange sphere hovering just above tree top level as I was driving with my friend on Highway 101 approx. 23:00 hours in June of 1981.  Have wanted to report this every since I witnessed it years ago. It bothers me that I do not know what it was I saw. The Object was in my best estimate 20 to 30 feet in diameter,  And was stationary just above a tree line 30 feet from roadway. It was so bright in illuminated my dash board of my car. We saw it about a 1/4 mile away and thought it was the moon,  As we got closer it was obvious that it was very near to us.We pulled off roadway next to object.  No sound noticeable from object, It was an intense orange color and grew in size as we watched it. It had the appearance of molten glass and as it grew larger what looked like static electricity dissipated from its perimeter.  It grew dimmer as it got larger then simply just vanished only to reappear as a smaller more brighter sphere as before. I felt I co! uld throw a rock at it and hit it as it was so close.  Then it vanishes again. we could see stars in background where object was. Sped home to retrieve a Polaroid camera when we returned we waited at the site, Object never returned. Later on in years I met someone who saw a similar object in the same area!  I am very knowledgeable in physics and am a private sport pilot. But can not identify the object from that night.

I told my wife to check it out and that I thought it had to be UFO's.  We both watched them for about 5 min when they both just disappeared.

White light Orb moving silently the size and brightness of  Venus moves half way across sky then fades totally away.;2012-04-21 22:25:00;90 seconds;White light Orb moving silently the size and brightness of  Venus moves half way across sky then fades totally away. On a clear night sky I saw a bright white object as bright as Venus moving from the west horizon. I thought it to be a jet airplane.  But it was larger, brighter, and lower in the sky.  It moved steadily like a satellite but was much to low in the sky to be one. It made no sound. I followed object until it was overhead with no light other than bright white.  The light slowly faded until it completely disappeared.  The clear skies showed no evidence of haze or clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Bright white light hoovering in the southeast sky near Olympia;2016-12-24 17:45:00;40;Bright white light hoovering in the southeast sky near Olympia Went out to get mail, saw very bright light in southeast sky.  Grabbed the binoculars, took a peek. It was a very ornate sphere that was lite on the outside from the outside but I could not see a light source.  It resembled, on the outside, one of those intricately carved stone balls that has a carved stone ball inside that and another carved stone ball inside that.  It was white but occasionally a black stripe or band would appear as if it were rotating.   However, when I was looking at it it did not seem to be rotating until the black band zipped through.   Guessing it was about 1500 feet up and I estimate it to be about as big as a modest sized house.  I did notice air traffic so they had to have seen it.   I did take video of it with my cell phone and snapped a few photos.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
