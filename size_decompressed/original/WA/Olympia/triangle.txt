Triangle of dots zipping accross the morning sky in Western Washington.;2001-04-23 05:30:00;10 seconds;Triangle of dots zipping accross the morning sky in Western Washington. Witnessed 3 events in succession facing east out of a second floor apartment window in downtown Olympia, Washington at around 05:30 pacific standard time. Each event consisted of an elongated triangle object with dots of light at its tips. The object or objects were yellow and orange. The object(s) appeared within the left edge of the window, bobbled, and then zipped to the right in an upward angle very quickly, then disappeared with a blip quite suddenly before exiting the frame of the window. Perhaps ten seconds later, the Object(s) reappeared from the right side at an angle, hovered, then zigzagged to the left, then up and blinked out. A few seconds later a similar occurence took place. The first object caught my attention because of the angle that it extinguished in and it's multiple lights. I waited for other objects and was awarded with further sitings! Really cool!;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Triangle shaped craft with three lights;2004-06-29 22:30:00;3hrs?;Triangle shaped craft with three lights Two of my friends and I were on a beach in Olympia WA relaxing.  We had a fire burning on the beach, a pretty big fire as a matter of fact. As we looked out towards Puget Sound we seen what we thought was a Stealth Bomber flying slow from the north towards us.  At the time we spotted it we estimated it was approximately 5 miles away.  I know a Stealth bomber is black but it had lights on the corners and it appeared to be shaped like a triangle. We thought it might have been from Whidbey island where Navy planes take off from.  However it was moving very slow towards us and low. We estimate that it was approximately 500 feet above the water and closing. As it got closer we did not get nervous but excited. What was weird is that we started to feel like we had static electricity on our bodies, kind of like an electrical charge.  As it hovered right above our heads we were looking up at it when it all of a sudden vanished, not took off in some direction, but just vanished as if it disappeared.  When we looked down the fire we had just started ten minutes ago that was blazing 10 feet high was just a burned out group of charred logs. For some reason we all felt very tired and instead of building another fire we just went to our tents and went to sleep.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Triangular object hovering in NW Sky Red/White lights. Then flew SE Slowely & Quietely with only 3 white lights.;2017-01-14 06:35:00;3-4 minutes;Triangular object hovering in NW Sky Red/White lights. Then flew SE Slowely & Quietely with only 3 white lights. One large triangular shaped object approximately 2000 ft. in Altitude appeared to be hovering in the NW Sky with red lights on top and white lights below and appeared to have a black line rotating around the white lights.   Then slowly and quietly it moved across the sky in a SE direction with only 3 white lights in the shape of a triangle.  It was a very dark, clear morning with many stars in the sky.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
I saw a non blinking sphere traveling West to East in the Northern twilight.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-29 21:30:00;2 minutes;I saw a non blinking sphere traveling West to East in the Northern twilight.  After halfway, the sphere stopped for a slit second then proceeded Eastbound.  This occurred three times. The spherical light then in an instant turned into a triangle with red dot type lights.  It then completely vanished.  No sign of anything else for another hour of observation.   Iâ€™m 53 years old, been outdoors for much of it and this was definitely weird.

Weird flying object flys upside-down next to I5 in Olympia;2020-01-03 05:25:00;5 minutes +;Weird flying object flys upside-down next to I5 in Olympia Driving North on interstate 5 this morning between exit 105 and exit 109 my husband and I saw an object with 3 white lights it was pretty low and then it turned sideways like if a plane was to bank to the right accept it kept turning and went upside down and flew like that for a few and then our view was blocked by some trees when we got off the freeway at exit 109 we could no longer see it.  It had the three white lights on the back and on red light on the front end.  It was really dark out so I am not sure what shape it was, but from what I saw it looked triangular.  Pretty weird though, I am sure we were not the only people on interstate 5 to what happened this morning.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
