captured strange lights in the sky with a digital camera.;2003-04-27 14:15:00;camera;captured strange lights in the sky with a digital camera. I was taking pictures of clouds and captured an anomoly. I have three photos and at this time I am trying to find an explanation. I am going out to the same location at the same time to try and duplicate the anomoly. If I can't, I will need some help. I personally am trying to disprove it. This is no joke I am a person with integrity. I don't know if it was some wierd situation with camera and sunlight. I can say these photos are Quite spectacular.  I have the photos on digital medium and have printed one photo, but I am not willing to share them with anyone without credentials.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Olympia, WA 01/03 UFO's;2004-01-03 23:05:00;1 minute;Olympia, WA 01/03 UFO's My girlfriend and I were out for a walk in the snow when she stopped to look at the moon which had appeared from behind the clouds.  She suddenly pointed out two brightly lit points of light in the sky, heading in a S-SW direction.  She asked if they were birds, and when I saw them, my immediate reaction was Hell No! The two seperate lights caught up to each other, in a leap frog fashion, each crossing and catching up to the first. Both were evenly lit from below, and in the area we were in, could not have been lit from below. I listened as well, given the low cloud cover, and could not hear any sign of aircraft noise. I have extensive experience in video, as well as audio and have filmed both cars at high speed and planes. I have seen and videotaped everything from A-10's to F-14 and F-16 aircraft, as well as Stealth aircraft at near and far range. With the cloud cover, the noise should have been obvious as the sound would have been reflected by the clouds. There was no perceivble sound. Both points of light disappeared into a cloud bank and we saw nothing more after that.  I immediately started running through things in my head to make sure I had time and distance and direction. My girlfriend was freaked out that I was so freaked by the situation.  I also have experience in visually tracking satellites and other space based objects, and nothing I have experience with could explain what I saw. As mentioned, the two objects converged on each other and diverged at a fairly high rate of speed, and remained consistently lit. I have never seen conventional aircraft perform in the manner of these unidentified objects.  We went out again tonight, and were able to easily identify any aircraft in the air, including a helicopter returning to Ft Lewis.  Nothing looked or behaved like the objects seen the night before.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Red Glowing Orb of Light;2012-07-09 00:00:00;1 1/2 minutes;Red Glowing Orb of Light Monday, January 9th ((sic.  July 09th))  @ 12am in West Olympia, WA, Washington had a lightning storm this evening.  The storm was in the north sky.   People were outside watching and socializing.  I took a moment to gaze myself in the front of my apartment.  I was doing laundry, and walked through the building to the back side to change the it over.  As I was walking, to the east a red light in the trees about 100ft away caught my eye. I stopped in mid stride. I muttered, What the?  and within 3 to 5 seconds found myself running towards it.  It was about 200 ft in the air, slowly descending above a thicket of Evergreens, behind a row of houses, and next to a church.  It was luminous red, orb like and very bright.  I am having trouble gauging the diameter of the object.  It wasn't huge, but it wasn't small either. Maybe 10ft x 10ft? The center of the object shone very bright.  So bright I squinted my eyes.  This made me think it was a helicopter.  But the closer I got, it was apparent this was no helicopter.  Associated with this red glowing orb was no sound, no wind, no smoke, no sulfur smell. Just a bright glowing red orb in a slow controlled decent into the trees. I was not the only witness. When I ran out to the street, there were two cars parked and idling in the middle of the road. Their passengers, teenagers. They had spilled out onto the sidewalk and were staring in awe just as I was, Did you just see that?   I said, The red glowing light, yeah!  What was that?  said one of the males.  Neither of us knew.  But we agreed that there was no sound associated with the mysterious red orb in the sky. I had my phone in hand ready to capture video, but it had disappeared into the trees before I could film.  One of the teenagers said he captured it with his video camera.  I was so focused on it returning, that I failed to exchange information with him so I could see the video he took.   After a couple of minutes they all drove away, and I continued to stand there for another 15.  I stared at the trees hoping it would reappear.  I also listened for something to indicate a hoax people partying in their back yards, laughter, music.  Anything to give logic to what we had seen.  There was nothing except quiet dark houses, white lightning and me alone in the street. I have knocked on the houses that the red orb descended behind, asking people if they were aware of what happened in the early hours of that morning.  One of the teenagers that was witness to the event lives in one of the houses and answered the door.  He says that it was a friend of a friend who took the video.  I left my name, email address and phone number hoping he will pass my information along.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
I saw 3 red lights in a perfect triangle shape.  They were very bright and we're very still.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-24 05:30:00;1-2 minutes;I was driving on HWY 101 and saw 3 red lights in a perfect triangle shape.  They were very bright and we're very still.   I went around a corner and was blocked by trees.   About a minute later, I could see the sky again, but the lights were gone.

Brilliant bright light to to the west of my house just above the horizon moving erratically.;2020-03-11 22:16:00;10-15 minutes;Brilliant bright light to to the west of my house just above the horizon moving erratically I was watching TV last night and as I was getting ready to head to bed I looked out my living room windows that face Due West and noticed what I thought at the time to be a star.  After watching it for a few moments, I noticed that it was moving Left and Right in short jerky movements.  As I watched it, the movements became longer and more lengthy in duration and speed.  It would move to the right for half a second and then to the left.  At roughly 2219 I grabbed my phone and started to record it both on video and still pictures. The more I watched it the more random and steady the movements became. at about 90% of the way though the duration on my viewing it became very almost deliberate and at the last moment it shot to the south west and covered 2-3 miles in less than a second and was gone.  This may not sound relevant but I had literally just completed watching Expedition Unknown on the Discovery Channel and they had just completed an hr long investigation of the Mt Adams area and had recorded something near there that was as close to what I was seeing as you could get,  A Bright white light, 2-3 times larger than Venus and it moved in near circles and back and forth left to right in the same manner that the object that I witnessed did.  They experienced virtually the same thing as me but I am 150+ miles to the NW of that area. My home faces west and has a large A frame style so I could see if from several different positions in the house. I uploaded the video to Facebook and almost immediately friends started mentioning that they had seen it too and one friend that I have know for 25+ years mentioned that she had seen the same thing back in the 1992-1993 in the house that she grew up in.  That house is 1.5 miles from me and faces the water in the same direction as mine. I would say that the object was just about 10 degrees above the horizon due west of my home.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
roundish light quite bright at 50K to 80K feet;2020-11-02 08:30:00;45 minutes;roundish light quite bright at 50K to 80K feet Just a roundish light that hung out at 50,000 to 80,000 feet.  I watched it for 45 min then decided to take a few pictures.  Didn't move during that time but the light seemed to change shape just a bit.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
