Light gray, possible teardrop shaped object being trailed by short pointed contrail which never changed size.;2014-09-11 10:10:00;10 minutes;Light gray, possible teardrop shaped object being trailed by short pointed contrail which never changed size. The object was at such a distance that it was difficult to determine the shape.  The closest we could determine was a possible tear-drop shape.  It was moving from West to East in the Southern sky.  The object was being trailed by a short contrail which remained the same length unlike a true contrail.  The object appeared to be a light gray color, but again it was at such a great distance it was hard to be certain.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
