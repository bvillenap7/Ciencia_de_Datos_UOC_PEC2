I was driving on a well-trafficked road in Olympia (Division St.)  I believe this road runs North-South (I would have been driving North), although I could be wrong .  I noticed a cluster of lights in the sky, all of varying size, and all larger than stars.  There were more than five and less than a dozen, but I'm unsure of the exact count.  If I was in fact driving north, then the lights would have been moving from West to East.  I was not the only one on the road at the time, and I know other drivers witnessed the event as well, because many were slowing down and craning their necks.  I also noticed some pedestrians pointing toward the sky in the direction of the lights.  I watched the lights for 10 to 15 seconds before they arced toward the ground as if they were falling, and disappeared behind some trees.  All the lights appeared to be moving at the same speed and in the same direction.  I am unsure of their color, although my initial guess would be white.  Also, my firs! t thought was that the lights were not aircraft lights, as in lightbulbs or some other electrically-produced lights, but were instead produced by flames or heat (which is why I compared them to shooting stars rather than planes).;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626

At about a 45 degree angle we observed a flight of ???? moving from left to right in a formation. Upon entering my driveway I observed some objects moving across the northern sky from left to right at about a 45 degree angle. They appeared to be in formation. Some of the were trailing sparks...looked kind of like a childs sparler used on the 4th of July. There must of been 6 to 10 objects. I live East of Olympia and South of Lacey in the country. It was very clear. We turned off the engines to the vehicles and could not hear the objects.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Five to seven lights looking like meteors slowed, swarmed and then flew southwest.  ((anonymous report));2019-09-03 22:00:00;Seconds;Five to seven lights looking like meteors slowed, swarmed and then flew southwest. While outside smoking a cigarette with friends I spotted what looked like a few meteors falling, without warning and in synchronization the lights slowed, swarmed like flies in the air.  Then swiftly and silently took off Southwest. (White lights before slowing, transitioned blue like a far star before swarming and stayed blue when leaving.

linear object with white round lights going down or across sky to East;2020-08-07 03:05:00;30 seconds;linear object with white round lights going down or across sky to East I saw a long white linear formation going down the sky at night, very slowly fell or went across sky to the East.  I thought it was a meteor but it was too slow.  I quickly got binauculars and it looked like linear object with white round lights.  It was bigger than diameter of moon.  no noise produced or crash heard.  it continued in straight line toward horizon maybe towards Joint Base Lewis McCord until the trees blocked further view.   maybe a deflated weather balloon reflecting light from moon?;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
