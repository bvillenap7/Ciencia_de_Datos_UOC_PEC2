light appeared far away in the sky, moved at same speed for about 1 min. then disapeared.;2000-02-04 19:30:00;1.5 minutes;light appeared far away in the sky, moved at same speed for about 1 min. then disapeared. My friend and I were walking to his house from my house, its not that far, but I have a long driveway and we were about halfway down it when I asked him if he wanted to sleep outside. He asked me if I was crazy since it was a cold night. I stopped him and said but look at all the stars, they are so cool. I was pointing out some constellations when all of the sudden he grabbed me and yelled look, I turned and looked as he pointed to a light that looked like a star, but it was moving at a constant speed across the sky kind of fast. It went for about a minute then disappeared I was kid of freaky and cool at the same time. most of the people we told tonight have laughed it off, but I swear with what ever I can that this happened tonight, And it's not the first time neither. This happened on 2-4-00  approximately 7:30 p.m.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Unexplained bright light at satellite level which did not conform to  ordinary  sky sightings.;2000-07-14 23:00:00;1-2 seconds;Unexplained bright light at satellite level which did not conform to  ordinary  sky sightings. At satellite level a light shown from dim to bright over a 1-2 second period, becoming extraordinarily bright and then immediately blinking out. The object was not observed until it began to change intensity so no pattern of movement was observed beforehand. The phenomena was unlike a meteor (which rapidly streaks) or a satellite moving evenly across the night sky. Since the light covered no distance in the sky a possible explanation would be that something under some degree of control (?) passed through the sun's light as the object either exited or enter the earth's atmosphere. This idea parallels video tapes on television which seem to spotlight mysterious objects in the earth's high atmosphere. This UFO report is similar to other website reports of objects at satellite/star level.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Light hovers over western Olympia, WA for over 10 minutes.;2001-02-12 20:50:00;20 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witnesses were observing Venus in the western sky.  PD)) Light hovers over western Olympia, WA for over 10 minutes. It was close to 9pm and I was listening to the local community radio station, KAOS, out of the Evergreen State College. A woman who sounded like she was in her late 30's-early 40's called in to ask if anyone else had reported an unusual light in the west. The station's talk show host disregarded the caller, but I ran outside and looked to the west. It was a very clear night sky. Low on the western horizon was a very bright light that was magnitude 1 in brightness compared to the rest of the night sky. It was very slowly drifting to the north-northwest. After getting a winter jacket, I ran from my backyard to a better vantage point. I positioned myself on the Capital Blvd. bridge over I-5 and sighted the object in the west. It was just sitting low on the horizon and after a few minutes, it would drift north and then stop again. The bright light was white in nature with an impression of red, but at my distance it was difficult to tell. I am familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft taking off from the Olympia airport to the south and I noticed that several planes had taken off, but changed their flight patterns from the normal pattern that would have taken them within close proximity of the object in the west. The planes were all banking sharply to the northeast. After about 10 minutes, the object had drifted behind some evergreens in the foreground. I decided to run back home for a pair of binoculars. Upon reaturning the object was no longer in view from the bridge. I changed position but still didn't see the object again. I did notice that several more aircraft had taken off and still they veered to the east. I thinking that since I heard of this object on the radio I'm not the only person who witnessed this light. I know that there was at least one other person the woman who tipped off the radio listeners that Monday night.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
light changing colors over olympia, wa;2001-03-19 21:00:00;hour or more;light changing colors over olympia, wa for an hour or so i saw a light about the size of a star far above the capitol bld.  i am on the eastside of olymia and was looking at it west.  like i said, it looked about the size of a star, but it was changing colors in a pulsing or rotating way--from white to red to blue.  there are many planes flying over olympia at night, but this didn't move it's position.  i tried to videotape it, but i just looked blurry, i couldn't  focus it in.  but zooming in on it made it look a definate shape, a  sphere or almost barrel shape.  the light seemed very bright though at a distance, like halogen lights.  i suppose it could be a planet or plane?  but it stayed there for at least an hour in the same spot, then i came back to the window and it was gone.  at certain points i thought i saw tiny lights appearing near it and flying towards it.

Electric Ball Rises Slowly Above Olympia;2001-06-07 04:00:00;45 minutes;Electric Ball Rises Slowly Above Olympia It was 4 a.m. and dawn was just beginning to break. About 20 degrees up in the sky, over the horizon of the west side of Budd Inlet, a very bright white light held steady and very slowly moved up into the sky over a period of 45 minutes and then dissapeared behind the clouds. At first we thought it was a very bright star or a planet, but then it moved, and we realized it was at least 4 times as big and bright as the biggest star or satellite we had ever seen. When we viewed it in the binoculaurs, it appeared that there was a bright white electric ring buzzing around a greyish object. Interestingly, the object was just above the Fort Lewis base near Tacoma, where we can see bright flashes and feel the ground rumble whenever they test artillery - sometimes as late as 12 midnight. This may have been an experimental military aircraft, given it's location, but whatever it was, it was unlike anything we had seen before and certainly gave us all the chills. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received no other reports of this incident that we are aware of.  If anyone else was witness to the phenomenon, we would welcome a call.  We will inquire of the witness, a student, whether he succeeded in obtaining a photograph.  PD));47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626

looking through an open drivers-side window to the west while about to pull into my driveway, thought what i was to see was a very brig;2003-09-28 23:10:00;seconds;looking through an open drivers-side window to the west while about to pull into my driveway, thought what i was to see was a very bright meteor to my left.  that meteor jetted to the southeast in my theater of westside viewing, not to the southeast part of the sky, just the bottom right of my center of viewing to the west.  it did this at the same speed it was making left to right on a clear night. heard word from the center there was a fireball sighting about 30 minutes prior to my encounter with this UNIDENTIFIABLE OBJECT.  after my call to the center and countless times telling myself, i've never seen that before, i got some fresh air and peered off to the west again, only to see a shooting star crossing top right to bottom left in the same westward viewing theater.  you couldn't draw it up any better. i've seen strage things before in the sky, but, would never have bothered to call, let alone tell my story here.  i had tears in my eyes all night from a combination of satisfaction of seeing this with both eyes open and yet, frustration that i can't tell anyone except my kids who have an open-mind we wish all had.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
5 objects over Olympia, WA chasing each other while turning into bright concentrated balls of light then to nothing.;2004-04-26 19:30:00;20-30 minutes;5 objects over Olympia, WA chasing each other while turning into bright concentrated balls of light then to nothing. I was cooking at the restaurant where I work and I noticed that none of the cooks were on line, so I went out back looking for them and they were all staring at these 5 bright lights that would go from not being visible to being a bright ball of concentrated light, no flickering.  They did this in a very random pattern.  Sometimes they would all light up individually at different times and sometimes two or three or four of them would all light up together in different hovering positions in the sky.  Not predictable at all.  One of the other cooks said that they were lighting up and then flying around each other in ways that airplanes or helicopters couldn't.  He said, It looked like they were playing tag.  When I saw them they were very stationary or after some time they would slowly change their positions, but then stop and hover again doing their light show.  Their numbers went from 5 of them and about 20-30 minutes later I went out back with our dishwasher and saw one remaining, but faint.  We were looking to the North from downtown Olympia by the Farmer's Market on the water.  They also seemed to be in the flight path of airplanes flying into Sea-Tac.  Pilots must have seen something weird...  Right before they would lost all their light, I could see a very tiny object behind the light and I would say it was saucer shaped, although it looked very far away right before it disappeared.  When they would light up though, they were bright.  Not a star in the sky at the time, you could only see the moon and these things lit up brighter and with more intensity and solid white light than anything I've seen in the sky.  A good handful of customers saw them as well.  One guy even called up our local paper here, the Olympian, to tell them what was going on.  He said he is in the military and had never seen anything like that so he called it in.  I checked after the sun went down and I didn't see anything.  I think that their light came from the sun, because the sun was directly behind us whil! e looking at them.  As the sun went down, the less and less intense the lights became.  Like they had as much light to show us as the sun had to give them.  They were brighter than any airplane light, planet or even Venus right now.  It was rad.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626

My husband and I were leaving our house to go out for dinner.We have a long drive way which takes main road. As we were approaching the main road we were startled to see 3 lights.Two of the lights seemed to be in back of the trees,and one seemed to be traveling in front of the trees.We guessed them to be about 100 feet in the air.My husband thought it was some kind of search light.We continued driving north to try and get a better look.We continued 1-4th mi. and then got out of the car to get a better look.We observed 4 glowing lights which would the go to the center and become one.They kept repeating this pattern.We could see nothing above or below this object.We live in a rural area ,approximately 11 mi. s.e. of the city. This seemed to be hovering over a field. The object seemed to be moving north so we continued to follow.We once more got out of the car,where it seemed to hovering near the railroad tracks. We watched as it kept repeating the same pattern for approximatly 10 minutes. My husband and I were shocked and excited ,it was like nothing we had ever seen before. The object seemed to be moving again so we continued to the next cross street and followed for approx.1/2 miles where it hovered again. This object kept repeating the pattern and finally became one light and disappeared into thin air.The back drop this time was all trees over a field.We observed no other color other than the white light.My husband and I are still in shock. We both feel we witnessed a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with these two witnesses, and we found them to be exceptionally serious-minded, and credible.  At first, we thought that they might have been witness to circling advertising lights, but they believe that not to be the case.  We do not know what they witnessed.

Low, quick light seen over Olympia, Washington, neighborhood.;2006-11-26 21:25:00;3 seconds;Low, quick light seen over Olympia, Washington, neighborhood. I was walking in my neighborhood and something caught my eye overhead. I looked up and saw a light move very quickly then disappear. The direction was northerly, in a straight line, no quick stops or turns. The light was steady white, not flashing, and no shape could be discerned. There was no sound at all either before or after I saw the light. There was no 'tail' or appearance of fire or dust like might be expected if it was a meteor. After only seconds, I could no longer see the light. It did not go behind trees or any obstruction, it did not appear to hit the ground, it was just suddenly no longer visible. The light appeared to me to be low in the sky, lower than the numerous commercial airlines I see and hear regularly. I have never seen anything like this before, and I regularly look at the sky in the evening, as my husband and I enjoy looking at stars and planets through a telescope. We have seen satellites - this was not one. We have seen shooting stars - this was not one. We have seen commercial airlines - this was not one. Most peculiar to me, was the fact there was absolutely no sound.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626

two lights slowly hovering southward across the night sky that dimmed until they dissappeared;2009-05-31 02:00:00;1 minute;two lights slowly hovering southward across the night sky that dimmed until they dissappeared It was late in the evening and we had just gotten home from a movie.  I got out of our van and looked west-ward, in the sky hovering I saw what looked like two stars, one directly above the other.  They were both slowly moving southward and were at the the time when I saw them the brightest objects in the sky besides the moon.  The lights were moving so slowly that it was actually hard to tell they were moving unless you compared them to the stars in the background.  When I was sure that they were not stars or satellites, or anything explainable I asked my girlfriend to come around to my side of the van to look at the lights.  She did, she saw them too, but by the time she came around they had already become much dimmer as we looked on they just disappeared.

Stationary circle of star-shaped lights.;2010-03-05 22:35:00;4 minutes;Stationary circle of star-shaped lights. While driving southbound on Capitol Blvd in Olympia (Very near the Tumwater border at the three-way intersection of Capitol/SunsetWay and Canyon Ave.),  I glanced to my left (East) and saw what I thought was a burst of fireworks but was stationary.  I slammed on the brakes, reversed to where I could observe and studied the item.  It was a series of star shaped (with possibly six or eight points) arranged in a circle hence my original thought that it was a starburst-type circle.  I stuck my arm out fully and with my thumb up found it to be about the size of my thumb from the knuckle up.  I observed for about four minutes.  The object/light or item never moved nor changed color or brilliance. I have lived in this neighborhood for nearly seven years and know the geography and landmarks fairly well.  There is no radio tower or any solid object in that direction.  I could only poorly estimate it's altitude as about 1000 feet but that's difficult.   It was blue-white in colo!r.  I drove off to get to my destination reminding myself to return in a half-hour and observe again.  I forgot to do that.  Later tonight (03/06/10) I will return to that locale to check again.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Orange red light in sky turned to white as it moved figeting across the sky with no noise.;2011-08-11 22:10:00;2-3 minutes;Orange red light in sky turned to white as it moved figeting across the sky with no noise. I was standing outside looking at the moon.  Beside to the right and a little below I noticed an orange red glow.  It was large compared to the usual airplanes in the night sky. So I thought it might be close. It seemed to hover at first so I thought it might be coming toward me. As I watched it, it seemed to flicker.  So I then thought it was a firework or something on fire. I couldn't hear any noise out of the ordinary. I then watched it to see what it would do.  As I watched, I noticed it was moving right under the moon in the sky. When it got to a location under the moon opposite to the same location I first noticed it, the light became smaller and turned white in color.  It kind of blinked slowly as it finally faded. The movement reminded me of a cursor on a computer screen moving slowly and fidgety. I looked around the sky for anything else and noticed nothing else unusual.  I then concentrated on the point that it faded to see if it would reappear. It did n! ot. I never heard a noise that was unusual or that I could associate with the light.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Big, bright, white, oval light with a blue flash falling fast in the sky over Olympia, WA;2012-10-16 22:30:00;2 seconds max;Big, bright, white, oval light with a blue flash falling fast in the sky over Olympia, WA I was on my way home tonight (10/16/12) at about 10:30pm and I turned onto Henderson blvd. going towards downtown Olympia and if you know the road it is right next to watershed park which is a fairly but wooded park and tall evergreens line the road on both sides.  I only saw the light for a couple of seconds because of the high speed of which it was moving and because there was only so much space between the top of my windshield and the top of the tree line. The light was pretty far away, I am assuming, because it was only about half an inch long in the sky but still far too big for an airplane or a shooting star.  It was a very bright, shining, white oval-shaped light and right before it reached the top of the tree line there was a blue light that flashed right at the front portion of it.  It went from the top of my windshield to the tree line in about a second, maybe two.  It went down slightly horizontally but I could not tell if there was any other part of the structure, all I saw was the bright light. I tried so hard to debunk what I had seen, thinking maybe it was a reflection from my stereo or a street lamp or something but there are no street lamps on that portion of the road and the light was way to clear and bright to be a reflection.  Not sure exactly what it was, I cant find anything online about a plane crash or comet, etc.  This would be the first time I have every experienced anything close to maybe seeing a UFO.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626

I noticed two bright stars in the Southern sky, at about 65 degrees above the horizon, just above the tree tops. One star started moving at about the speed of an airplane to the East for about two or three seconds, and then it started moving around the sky in erratic movements.  It covered approximately 10 to 12 degrees of sky. By now, it was obscured by the trees, and I could not see it very well anymore. The whole incident lasted perhaps 10 seconds.

9 or 10 red/orange lights moving in impossible trajectories.;2014-09-04 21:10:00;10 minutes;9 or 10 red/ orange lights moving in impossible trajectories. While getting off the freeway heading towards the capitol building, my boyfriend and I noticed 9 or 10 orange/red circles of light floating in the sky to the left of the capitol dome.  The balls hovered without any sound but moved smoothly in several different formations.  At first, they were in no particular order, but seemed to rotate and move as one in a fluid fashion, some moving faster than others.  Then they paired up, one out of the two descended while the other ascended.  Then they reversed direction.  The final formation I saw were the pairs moving diagonally, but with the set of two still aligned in a straight line. The lights went behind some trees and when we searched for them again we didn't see them.  After about 10 minutes of driving around I saw a single light next to the dome of the Capitol building.  We passed another tree and then it had disappeared again. Both of us have never seen any sort of aircraft move so fluidly and silently.  The lights were much larger then any plane lights and moved in an impossible pattern.   I have no idea what it could have been but it was certainly unidentified.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626

They seemed to arise from the western horizon behind the trees.  They made absolutely no noise, which is why it appeared unusual to us.  They flickered slightly.  They were brighter than any stars or planets.  They flew overhead and disappeared into the clouds to the east one by one.  There was first a grouping of 6 followed by 5 more after an interval of maybe a minute.  At one point, one of them passed the one ahead of it, but otherwise they seemed to move at about the same speed, similar to that of an airplane.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
UFO sighting and possible abduction with time loss and distance teleportation.;2015-01-02 19:21:00;5-45 minutes;UFO sighting and possible abduction with time loss and distance teleportation. At 7:21pm I was departing out of the Brotherhood Lounge in Olympia after a few drinks to catch the last bus to Aberdeen/Hoquiam which left at 7:20pm.   As I ran out the door of the bar I turned the WIFI off on my phone and bolted across the street.  I don't recall any traffic coming towards me or around me as everything appeared silent, so began to cut across the parking lot near where the bus departed, as I was near the middle of the parking lot this bright light appeared above me.  Knowing that is was not the moon as that was visible in the sky this orbital light was practically a spotlight illuminating a circle on the ground around me.   Phone still in hand I pointed upwards to it and held the photo button down snapping these 4 HD shots before my phone went black and rebooted itself immediately with the Apple icon.  I laughed because of how the damn thing decided to reset itself and with the quickness.  Next thing I know time warped, it slowed dramatically as alm! ost like moving through Jello.  I recall being angry that I was force-ably being slowed as I needed to catch that bus as it's the LAST bus to the area I was going to.  Struggling through the atmospheric pressure I saw the light around me became a yellowish/orange hue.....now I've seen something like this before many years ago but was startled at this moment. I recall the light above me feeling like some sort of stealth silent helicopter as waves went through my body like being in a MRI/CATSCAN and then everything went bright white and POW!  Next thing I know I'm standing in thick fog bank of the side of the road feeling a bit bewildered of my surroundings but yet calmly okay.   Nervous, I light a cigarette and immediately my body rejects it causing me to vomit, I take a second drag and it happens again.  Music begins playing through my headphones I'm wearing which were previously in my backpack as I cut across the parking lot.  The music is the Gorillaz song 99-2000, I look to my left and her comes the bus through the fog. I pitch the smoke and wave the bus down, it stops....door opens and the gal driver says, I almost missed you there as it's not a normal bus stop.  I thank her stopping and go to place what typically costs me $3 into the drop box and she say's it's only $1 which I kinda shrug off as the money dropped and figured I just payed it forward on some deal they have going on.  She asks me if I am okay, I say yes and get on the bus....as I look down at the people on the bus they all had this odd smile on their faces and a orange glow or aura about them.  I sit down and end up messing with this guys backpack reorganizing his stuff in it without him noticing.  I comment to the bus driver how she's doing a fine job cutting through this fog and the guy who's backpack I'm messing with, without looking at me says we are dealing with Flice which is supposed to be fog ice....like I was supposed to know exactly what that meant.   I zip his pack up without anyone else noticing and listen to the song playing through my headphones and then realize as we pull out of the fog bank a ways, we are actually about 20 minutes to Aberdeen, WA. I know now that I reappeared in Montesanno about 40 miles from Olympia and I somehow beat the bus which takes about an hour to get to where it picked me up. WTF!??!?!??!?  I road the bus in to town and got off the bus doing a quick magic effect with my hat and a tangerine which I gave to the driver when she acted surprised and thanked her for the night. Once off the bus, I light another cigarette, and immediately rejected it, vomiting again and walked to a local bar called the Ace of Clubs. I forcefully choked down the smoke between gags and then went inside. I turned my WIFI back on and light flickered as I walked in. I didn't make eye contact and asked the female bartender for a PBR....and began uploading the photos I took to a group on Facebook that I'm a member of and start typing out what happened via my phone.  I began to tremble a bit and the photos give me a problem with not uploading in sequence and I'm pissed at my phone as I continue to type and that bartender asks me if I am okay?  I look up at hear and say, No...yes...well no...I'm not sure....something just happened to me that I cannot explain.  Will you please look at me and tell me if I appear intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or something?  She tell me I look perfectly sober and I began to tell her what happened showing her the images.  She listens, I cry.  She walks away and walks back I tell her some more and then her husband comes over eye looking all blurry but with a grin on his face as he begins rubbing my back.  He was a large man with very warm hands and asks me if I am okay?  I tell him the same thing I originally said to her and begin to describe the light I saw and he walks away shaking someone else's hand and I grab my phone, jacket and bag and split trying to video chat my buddy via my phone and having total glitch errors with it all.  I walk across the street and check my bank balance and light another cigarette to no problem as I walked off towards my mother's house.  I don't know what truly happened from that parking lot in Olympia to that fog banked road in Montesanno but I do know that this IS exactly what happened to me.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Bright light moves across the sky- then stops for a minute or two- then falls out of the sky and out of sight;2016-02-10 07:00:00;3 minutes;Bright light moves across the sky- then stops for a minute or two- then falls out of the sky and out of sight My husband and I watched a bright light move across the sky Wednesday morning between 7-7:30 am.  The second it stopped in the sky I yelled at him to pull out his phone.  It caught our eye because it was close and very bright, but there were no red or green lights to identify it as an airplane.  At the point in which my husband starts recording- you can see the light remaining still for some time.  Then it just starts to sort of drop down.  We are so far away from the object...  But I was really hoping to get a second opinion.  I have not found anything online (aside from ufo sightings) that matches our experience.  The video was too large to send from his phone, so I had him upload it to YouTube.  I will send the link in a separate email.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Two straight lines of light in the starless night sky, about 5 lights each.  First red, others white.  Stationary.  No stars out.;2017-04-28 21:00:00;30 minutes;Two straight lines of light in the starless night sky, about 5 lights each.  First red, others white.  Stationary. No stars out. Over Sylvester Park. Cloud cover, no stars out.  Straight line of lights, First on left reddish other lights white. Two similar, about as high as most large planes.  Not moving. About as long as my straight index finger in size when I held my finger up to measure. Watched on and off for half an hour.  Told someone else I know who also saw the one on left I pointed out to her.  She wasn't all that interested, commented, They must be looking at us, observing all here in the Park.  A large event in Olympia.  Procession of the Species the evening light event.  This wasn't something projected into the night sky, I stopped watching on and off to watch the parade and left.  Don't know how long the two straight lines of light lasted. Very bizarre.  Like Orions belt but closer together.  I was tempted to ask others what they thought of the objects, but only asked someone I knew to look at it. I didn't think to try and photograph the two objects.  I've lived in the medical field all my life.  Only saw UFO objects back in the mid fifties as a teen with a boyfriend.  A fleet of craft came into view, flew across the sky, and vanished, as if into a slot.  Both of us saw the same objects.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626

White solid light, erratic course over Olympia WA;2017-10-12 19:45:00;2 minutes;White solid light, erratic course over Olympia WA I noticed a bright light in the sky, pretty close to directly overhead.  It was on a course approximately 160 degrees.  I normally can spot satellites around this time, I've seen lights that later I found out were the ISS or Chinese Space Station, but its direction was not correct for a satellite from what I've read. It' course was not a straight line either, making left and right alternating s-turns.  I eventually lost sight of the object in the clads on the horizon. Lewis McChord airbase is to the east and I did not see navigation lights or strobes.  I used to be a private pilot and worked at the airport for an airline as a gate agent for 15 years, so I know aircraft lights.  It was a solid, non blinking white light.  Being that it was heading away from me I doubt it could have been landing lights because those usually face frontward.  I would guess that the direction took it toward the Olympia regional airport in Tumwater, but the movement was really odd, usually planes go in straight lines outside of airport airspace, and do not zig zag.  The speed was hard to judge without being able to tell distance, but seemed to not be unusual;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Light cluster in Olympia, WA.;2017-11-18 22:50:00;90-180 seconds;Light cluster in Olympia, WA.I I just copied this directly from my Fbook Page:  “I Just saw another UFO.  It came very fast from 300 degrees WNW.  I was a bright red light with a second that came on randomly.  It came to a full bobbed left, right and backward then continued to a position almost directly above me then an abrupt stop again.  Now a fast pulsing green light appeared on its left and the second red light came around from behind and dodged around a bit on the right side then disappeared behind it.  There was a wispy cloud around it and I could see light reflecting from the cloud as if a search light was employed an moved as if it was looking for something around and above it.  I didn’t observe the source of the light.  But could see the beam coming from the top of the object.  The object itself was obscured by the brightness of the red and green lights.  It then staggered back toward where it came from and disappeared over the horizon.  Again in 300 degrees WNW.  My location was close to Briggs and Kettle View park and perhaps 5 miles from the local airp! ort.  At first I believed it was going to turn and make an approach for landing and was just a high flying plane.  I did notice it was absolutely silent but while it was above me I heard the roar of two jets on about after the second.  Sounded like F15s.  I have seen the Gov’s Lear jet come and go from this vantage point but never hear it power up or down unless it’s right above me.  I grew up near Elmendorf AFB and that roar is unmistakable.  my locale BTW is Olympia, WA.  Did anyone else see this???by the time I got to my new Iphone and figured out the path to video capture it was over.  I couldn’t take my eyes if it.  I have seen thing in the sky a handful of times but this was by far the closest and most emotional for me.  Please PM me if you saw this too.”;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
3 yellow light there, then not, then back again;2018-11-07 21:09:00;1 hour;3 yellow light there, then not, then back again Noticed 3 lights appeared to be over right side Employment Security Bldg, (to right of DOT) on East Capitol Campus.  After watching them a minute they seemed to drop down behind trees.  A few minutes later I saw one light then two then another.  They stayed there for a bit then disappeared.  This happened repeatedly for about an hour then I didn’t see any more.  They were quite low and not headed for the airport.  All I could see were yellow lights, round lights and they appeared one at a time.  They also blinked off or sank low, one at a time.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Mysterious lights moving from the western sky to the eastern sky, 2 groups of 10,  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-25 05:50:00;10 minutes;Mysterious lights moving from the western sky to the eastern sky, 2 groups of 10, in line formation but distances were varying between I went out for a walk at 5:50 AM PST and was surprised that it was a clear night sky, since I went to bed to heavy rain.  As I walked south on our loop taking in the amazing stars, I saw what appeared to be 2 stars moving from my left to right – they appeared to be a similar distance apart as two stars in the big dipper handle.  They were moving quite rapidly, and my initial assumption was that it was the space station but, then told myself there wouldn’t be two.  I watched for about a minute and was going to run back to the house to wake my wife to see it… as I paused, I noticed a whole stream of similar lights following in somewhat equidistant distance but in a following formation.  There were about 10 in total zooming from west to east. At this point, I ran in, woke up my wife and had her outside in less than 2 minutes hoping they were not gone… to my surprise, I saw the tail end of the original set, with a new set that were heading east in a slightly more northeast direction which were led by 4 lights and then another 6 or more trailing single file.  They all moved from west to east and disappeared from sight because of the trees – we have tall trees in the neighborhood, so I would assume my viewing angle is about 40 degrees west to east.. There were no sounds and they were quite small like the space station – I watched as an airplane passed just minutes later and I could faintly hear the jet as it passed and the jet “light” footprint was larger than the unidentified lights.  My initial thoughts… -	I am up every morning for years and have never witnessed anything like this before, though I often see aircraft and hear them since SeaTac airport is about 40 miles north of us -	There were 2 distinct sets of objects – the first moving east on a slight southerly tangent, the second which my wife also saw moving east on a slight northerly tangent -	The distance between the objects was not consistent – it appeared if one would speed up to catch another but I never saw one move past the one in front of it they were definitely a group and they were definitely trailing each other in a very organized fashion -       They moved rapidly across the sky, similar to the international space station moves in relation to my view  We live near JBLM and our initial thought was military aircraft… but 20 or more?  That would be a lot of military craft.  With no sound accompanying?  With the ability at a distance to close the gaps between them in seconds?;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Orange orbs with accompanying rumbling noise.  ((anonymous report));2020-01-26 20:21:00;15 minutes;Orange orbs with accompanying rumbling noise. I see 2 orange lights that are stationary.  Heavy cloud cover excludes celestial objects, and no houses at this elevation.  The sky is rumbling like the sound of jets breaking the sound barrier.  The rumbling noise is what made me search the horizon.  I have been watching these orange glowing objects for 20 minutes with absolutely no movement.  This rules out an aircraft.  I’m no expert and I don’t frequent ufo websites, but these things compelled me to find out if anyone else in my area has seen this tonight.  It is troubling me.  Please confirm if anyone sees and hears what I’m describing.  Thanks.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
