White flash across the sky.;1976-02-23 09:41:00;5 seconds;White flash across the sky. I and my boyfriend were sitting outside of our apartment when I seen a bright white flash shoot across the sky like a shooting star only brighter.  As the flags was fading, I seen a white trail after the craft like the streams from an airplane in high altitude.  I knew it wasn't an airplane because of the white flash.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
A white light outside my south window was so bright it turned my blue curtains white.;1999-01-18 00:30:00;15 seconds;A white light outside my south window was so bright it turned my blue curtains white. Hello Peter, I don't know if this story is of interest to you because it happened in Olympia WA Jan. 18th 1999 at 12:30 am.A bright light outside my south window was so bright that it turned my blue curtains white.  Within 8 second a very strange hissy kind of hum enveloped the house from the south. It sort of sounded like a huge electrical transformer station approaching very close.  Three other adults in different rooms of the house saw the light and heard the sound.  It penetrated like a wave passing inside the house. The whole thing lasted about 15 seconds. It was late and I was in bed at the time. I do wish I had looked out of a north window to see what the heck it was. I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my house sits on the 5 mile FAA marker for the Tumwater airport. Did you get any other reports around that night.  It definitely was strange and I had a very interesting dream that night. I have had many experiences with UFO's, but this was the most recent possibility. Thanks for the response.

Was walking to the front door in a Southern approach. Noted a small single engine aircraft going over head at about6000 feet on a pattern for the Olympia airport. As I looked at the plane my right periphial noted a white object at about *20,00 feet moving quite fast in a southern pattern and above the small plane. It continued to move above the small plane and then seemed to stop in mid air hence going straight down at an unbelivable rate of speed and again in my vision, below the airplane and then seemed to disappear into no where or in the direction of the Black Hills. Itleft me with the same impression of unbelivable movemen I have seen in other filmed sightings on television but never for real such as this. Again the movement was what quickly gained my attention. Unreal.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
6 objects appear through same entry point in sky 1 by 1 out of nowhere speed away and fade into thin air.;2002-08-21 03:30:00;1 hour;6 objects appear through same entry point in sky 1 by 1 out of nowhere speed away and fade into thin air. My wife and I both avid sky watchers, in our mid 40's semi-retired, good eye sight, no illusions of aliens, saw out of the east at 40 degrees up , 6 objects appear one at a time aproximately 7 min. apart. Each appearing where the last one did. We watched that sky space as each object appeared out of nowhere. What started as a pin-glow got bright as the moon, larger than the brightest star, then seemed to grow a little more and started moving rapidly to the north as the glow turned into more like moon light reflection.It faded from a sliver of reflection into nothing. No noise. Duration 10 seconds tops. We observed this 5 good times the first time we only saw the bright glow and the fade.Even though they appeared really bright at first I think it was reflection off the almost full moon because it was the same color.{as opposed to self lit} It would be like someone holding a round mirror and reflecting moonlight right on you then turning the mirror and running away. The top part seemed curved by the way the light reflected off it.After the 6th one a big jet from the SE flying low in the direction of the entry point ended all activity. From this jet we could see that these objects were much faster and had a totally different lighting.{none except reflected}If I believed in secret crafts or aliens then I would say last night someone or thing came to visit or to stay, because what or whoever it was, definately got in.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
no appearing lights tonight , just those light orbs.Anyone else see them?;2002-08-23 01:40:00;1.5 hr.;no appearing lights tonight , just those light orbs.Anyone else see them? on the 21st we reported appearing lights and fast moving craft of unknown shape except light reflections at approx.40 deg. up. For the last two nights no reoccurance. The skies seem to clear of commercial aircraft before midnight,local ones anyway. I do know that planes as I have seen plenty when banking toward you will look like bright headlights except when they turn they always show red and white lights.The things I described were different because no sound and no light plus all the air traffic seems lower on the horizon . One real and possible explanation is military aircraft going out of mcCord or Fort Lewis undercover of darkness. Funny thing on Sept. 10th last year the night sky traffic was really odd I was out on nisqually fishing all night and tonight the things moving around remind me of the things we all saw that night in the sky glowing orbs and darkened craft not sporting what one would consider proper lights. Although I believe these things military related. Hey if you want to hide just look like everybody else.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
point of light moving thru the sky flashes then vanishes.;2004-08-13 04:35:00;20 seconds;point of light moving thru the sky flashes then vanishes. I couldn't sleep and went outside it was twilight , I looked straight up above my backyard and saw a point of light moving similar to a satellite. Then it flashed and vanished. The odd part is , just a split second after I waved at it ,is when it vanished. Odd indeed. 08/13/2004. this software says this date is future.

Extremely loud sound like classic '50s movie flying saucer, flying low over house with bright flashing lights.;2004-11-03 22:00:00;30 Seconds;Extremely loud sound like classic '50s movie flying saucer, flying low over house with bright flashing lights. Just after going to bed, we heard an extremely loud sound rapidly coming from south to north directly over our house. It seemed to be just barely above the house. The sound was that of the typical movie flying saucer sound from a '50s outer space flick.  It was an extremely loud, very high-pitched whoop, whoop, whoop sound...very rapid and very squeal or beep-like. We thing about 80 or 90 decibels. The sound was accompanied by chaotic bright white flashing lights.  The object flew over extremely fast...I jumped out of bed and ran outside - hoping to get a glimpse, but it was already gone...just a residual sound in the distance.  A light fog was beginning to form outside, but I should have been able to see at least the flashing.  I have never heard anything like this, except in the old flying saucer movies.  We've lived here for the past 8 or 9 years, right near Fort Lewis, and within 30 miles of the McCord Air Force base, and see and hear many aircraft, but nothing like this...so loud, so close...and so strange.  We are both in our late 50's, college grads, and wide awake at the time of this happening. Although I believe there are such things as UFOs, I have never seen any and my husband is a skeptic. We almost couldn't believe this was happening, because it was just too Hollywoodish.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Satellites dance in the night sky.;2005-08-15 11:00:00;5 minutes;Satellites dance in the night sky. It was a very clear night in Olympia, Washington. What appeared to be, at first, several different satellites moving across the sky.  One appeared. Then, I spotted another from a completely different location. I am familiar with seeing satellites in the night sky, but I came to realize these were not satellites.  Satellites are easy to spot. They always move in one single direction orbiting at an even pace in relativity to the Earth’s rotation.  Several minutes later, I spotted more of them. Only thing was, some of them began to slow down. One even came to a complete stop.  I could hardly believe my eyes as I watched several of these objects slow down, speed up, stop, and even change directions. It was truly amazing to watch. This dance of objects way up high only lasted for a few minutes.  From what I could tell, the objects simply disappeared. I searched the skies but no moving objects could be spotted again later that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

At approximately 2:05PM the entire night sky became lighted briefly in microsecond bursts as during thunder or lightning. This situation has unusual because their was no noise. I looked as if a giant flash bulb went off in the sky  This event intermittently at 30 second intervals for around five or six minutes  The source seemed to be at a Southwesterly direction.  I went walking in the direction of the event and it stopped suddenly.  Neighbor independently claimed hearing indistinct booms and grumbling sounds from the Southwestern direction.

Surrounded by aliens;2014-07-05 23:00:00;5 minutes;Surrounded by aliens It happened in July 2014 right after the 4th of July in Olympia, WA.  My girlfriend and I were star gazing in a football field.  She had the sudden urge to leave and then I felt the urge to leave that she did.  We started to head out towards the gate and had to go through the field to get out.  Once we got in the middle of the football field, we were surrounded by figures that kept fading in and out of our vision.  I couldn’t make out any faces, but they were a dark tannish dirt color.  Some were tall and some were short and a bit fatter.  The shorter ones were still taller than me and I’m 5’5.   We kind of stood in the center of them like we couldn’t move for about 5 seconds and then we bolted toward the gate (It was the only area that the aliens weren’t covering).  We didn’t stop running until we got to the street.  My girlfriend first told me what she saw and it is exactly what I saw.  I also completely forgot about the entire experience for a few years, until I had a dream about those aliens.  Can you give me any closure at all?   At the time, I believed but wasn’t educated in it, so I didn’t take note of losing time or anything.  Closure would be amazing… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD);47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Slow moving, bright colored light in western sky.;2015-12-31 05:33:00;10 minutes;Slow moving, bright colored light in western sky. Sky was clear.  Looking at stars.  Noticed a bright sparkling object in western sky.  Moved very slow in what appeared to be a northern direction.  With binoculars you could see there was more than one light.   Green, white and red or maybe orange.   Thought maybe it was a helicopter hoovering (sic.  Hovering), but the lights didn't seem right.  There was a blinking pattern.   Disappeared or flew into the fog bank.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
