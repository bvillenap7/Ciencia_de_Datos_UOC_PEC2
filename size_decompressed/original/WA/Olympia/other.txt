Possible meteor impact due south of the washington state capital of olympia, washington;1999-04-24 21:30:00;4 seconds;Possible meteor impact due south of the washington state capital of olympia, washington At or around 21:30 on Saturday the 24th of April, a friend and I were driving South bound on the I-5 towards Olympia. 22 miles North of the capitol I saw in the south eastern sky at or about 45 degrees from the horizon what appeared to be a meteorlike object falling to earth. it glowed hot white and gold in color and appeared to drip out of the sky at blinding speed. To the South lay a cloud bank that I believe to have hung over Centralia. This object passed between our position and the southern bank of clouds that hung in the twilight. The entire event lasted no more than 2-4 seconds in duration. I have no doubt that the impact was somewhere SE of the I-5 corridor in Olympia. I work as a underground utility location dispatcher in Bellevue, Washington. My trip to Olympia Saturday was to attend a house warming of a old friend. As a sometimes avid skywatcher I have in my life seen many meteor showers.This was not the most spectacular event I have witnessed, but this one definitely hit deck so to speak. I am aware of the Montana event and have spoke to an aquantence who believes he saw that same object Friday somewhere on the 405 North corridor in Bellevue. The object I saw however was definitely an independant event occuring Saturday.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Fiery obj obs in daylight descent near I-5 in Olympia, Washington;2000-10-29 17:00:00;10-15 secs.;Fiery obj obs in daylight descent near I-5 in Olympia, Washington WITN on I-5 obs 1 (one) object on a continuous downward trajectory east of freeway. It appeared to be burning up, almost flared out, and then flared up and then went out. WITN obs helipcopter (unk if military or civilian) that appeared to be headed in the direction that the obj was falling. Unk if impact occurred. Note that this was very bright and that it was mostly daylight when it occurred. WITN is well known to reporting party and has high reliability. While discussing the incident with WITN, we discussed the possibility that this could have been debris in decaying orbit burning up in atmosphere. Considered very probable. No further at this time. Unk if there were other witns.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Seen bright, round, large white light, center very bright, duration 1-2 seconds.;2000-11-21 20:00:00;1-2 seconds;Seen bright, round, large white light, center very bright, duration 1-2 seconds. Observed bright large light in Northern sky. Sky was partially cloudy, wind direction SW to NE. Light was high in the sky. Center of light white, intense, round. Light dimmed within 1-2 seconds, then disappeared altogether. No recurrence. Reminded me of a light bulb which brightens before burning out. My position: approx. 2 miles south of Tumwater Airport which is located south of Olympia. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite articulate, and quite credible.  We believe she may have seen the flare of an Iridium satellite, but that is a guess.  We directed her to the Heavens-Above.com website to check to see if the flash could be ascribed to an Iridium flash.  PD));47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Four adults couldn't identify an object that flew over Olympia Washington June 16, 2012.;2002-06-16 20:30:00;5-10 minutes;Four adults couldn't identify an object that flew over Olympia Washington June 16, 2012. On Saturday, June 16, 2012, as my wife and I went to our car after dinner with friends, our hostess noticed an object in the sky and asked, “Look, what’s that?”  An object appeared SE of Olympia HS at estimated altitude -1500 ft rising to cloud cover I estimate at 4000 ft. where it disappeared into the cloud cover.  A couple of my companions said they saw smaller objects following the large one.  I only observed one object.  The object moved on an apparent straight course that I guess to be from SW near Black Lake to NE disappearing into the cloud cover over Lacey, WA.  I estimate the trajectory to be ENE roughly following the course of Interstate 5.  I estimate the time we observed the object to be between 5 and 10 minutes.  Our host retrieved his binoculars and tried to focus on it just before it went into the cloud cover.  All four of us observed the object at a time none of us marked but I estimate between 8:15 and 8:40 p.m. with good daylight still avai! lable at this latitude.  Olympia winds at that time were from SW @ 8 mph on 6/16/12.   The object’s speed I estimate between 50 and 60 mph.  There was no noticeable wind at ground level.  It moved as if sailing on the wind but appeared faster than the 8mph wind.  It moved smoothly without stopping or any noticeable change of direction or speed.  It appeared to me to slowly ascend as it traveled across the sky that provided a gray background for the sighting.  There was no noticeable noise though the object moved as if powered.  I viewed the object as a larger object with a smaller object or part suspended underneath of about ¼ to ½ the size of it’s larger companion.  They appeared to fly in perfect unison so I viewed them as connected in some manner.  They flew close enough to be seen as one.  I estimate the combined parts to have been 15 to 30 feet in height and 12 to 20 feet in width.  None of our guesses about its identity added up since a helicopter would have made noise and a different shape as would a plane.  An ultralight would also have made motor noise and I would not expect an ultralight to climb into the cloud cover at that altitude.  A runaway bundle of balloons or large runaway Kite is unlikely given the mild wind recorded that day.  I’m curious whether there were any similar sightings this day or if our sighting has been explained.  To us, it was not an identifiable object.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626

Fast moving light with trail, like a comet but not a comet.;2013-12-07 16:00:00;8 minutes;Fast moving light with trail, like a comet but not a comet. Was sitting at a bus stop on Cooper Point Road.  My daughter said Mommy look up a shooting star   I looked up.  It was not a shooting star.  There was a streak of light moving pretty fast across the sky.  I thought for a minute it was an airplane, however no airplane has a trail like a comet or ship like that.  Not in Olympia.  It was a good 8 mins before it just disappeared.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626

Tons of activity in Olympia's sky.;2015-07-28 00:00:00;Everyday;Tons of activity in Olympias Sky. I would say it was cigar shaped but they are two white lights which seem to move on a pole but I couldn't see anything there.  The two lights will dim and brighten sometimes one goes out. I saw what seemed to be a star and then it started moving.  What seemed to drop behind the Horizon.  I saw this for the first time around 2001 but they were red. People were stopping and yelling at random people saying, Are you seeing this!   The next day Nasa said it was a space station and we all know that a space station that can go from one side of the horizon to the other in one second is much faster then sound.  I never saw the one that follows. The star I SAW IN OLYMPIA seemed like the red light I saw Years ago in Cleveland. I think it is some kind of depth perception tech.  If these are really in space then what we are seeing is at light speed. I don't mean to come off as if I am self centered but this wouldn't have anything to do with me finding the ancient Holy Books would it. In 2012 I saw the Mayan prophecy come true.  Kukulcan is real or those lights are some kind of technology.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
