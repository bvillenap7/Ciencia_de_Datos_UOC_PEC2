Large rectangular craft  following the freeway just above tree level in Olympia-Lacey, WA area.;2008-02-01 07:15:00;1-2 minutes;Large rectangular craft  following the freeway just above tree level in Olympia-Lacey, WA area. Conditions: overcast, grey, no fog, visibility good. Just east of the Sleater-Kinney Rd SE and Martin Way E intersection, I noted a flashing red light moving in my direction from the southwest – unable to estimate altitude, and too far away to make out details or shape. About 0.5 miles  distance, there  are two stoplights - one at College Ave S and Martin Way E, and the other a bit farther east at the I-5 Freeway interchange.  I was waiting for the green at the second stoplight when a craft entered my vision from the right, about tree line level, directly over the freeway, flying slowly and completely silent. I clearly saw a large and, I think, rectangular craft. I did not see a cockpit, wings or tail. (I admit I was pretty astonished and didn’t look as carefully as I would if I saw something like that again.) It was not like any aircraft I've seen nor did look like the pictures of the triangular stealth jet.  It was possibly the length of a large jet (747)and seemed to be about as wide as the freeway lanes.  The flashing red light was in the middle of the bottom of the craft. There were bright white lights across the end and what appeared to be lighted windows along the side. The traffic light changed almost immediately and I drove under the freeway, looking up and observing the bottom of the craft. It seemed to be on a slight descent and the bottom seemed completely flat with just the red light in the middle. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I apologize for being so far off in my estimation of the length of time I observed the craft in Feb. '09.   Subsequent to my report, (Jan '10), I stopped at the same intersection at approximately the same time in the morning.  The length of time I could possibly have been able to see the aircraft was between 3-5 seconds rather than several minutes. The craft did enter from the right.  However, due to the proximity of the intersection to the overpass and the heighth of the trees at the freeway level I could not have seen it until it was only slightly right of my position.  It did not make any sound that I could detect. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
