Dancing lights over Olympia;1979-10-01 21:00:00;2 hours;Dancing lights over Olympia   It was October 1979 and I was walking to a party through the town of Olympia, WA at around 8:45 pm with a friend. We noticed a saucer shaped craft over a tree and commented on it and watched it. It is imposdsbile to say how large the craft was since the distance was unclear but it appeard to be maybe 50 feet across 25 feet high. IT was hovering and very still. I heard no sound. It had three lights in a triangle formation. The lights would switched places and I could actually see them move as if to occupy the place where the other light had been. We both stared at the object without saynig anything. After what seemed to be a minute or so it shot up at about a 2:00 position very quickly and went out of sight. I thiknk we said, what was that? and we both didn't know. We had expected to get to the party at right about 9 pm to help set it up. When we got there the party was in full swing and it was 11 pm. We were very surpried and I said to my friend, do you know it's 11 or something to that effect and he confused by this as well. Niether of us spoke about it but it (now) seems clear we lost time. I have not memory of anything further. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
young children experience a near abduction by a UFO in their own back yard in Olympia, Washington, May 2001.;2001-05-26 20:00:00;4 minutes;young children experience a near abduction by a UFO in their own back yard in Olympia, Washington, May 2001. Two children ages 6 and 9 witnessed in their back yard a huge flying object in the sky that flew toward them at a sharp angle and rested over them with a huge bright white light in the center beaming down on them.  They both ran for cover under the eve overhang of the backyard cottage.  They were screaming for their mother in the house,  mom, mom, help us, help us.  The oldest felt that the space ship as she called it was trying to steal them.  This is why she grabbed her younger sister and hid from the light.  Both girls have drawn the pictures of what they saw.  The saucer shaped UFO had many, many lights circling around the edge of the UFO that seemed to change shape and the middle had a huge center of bright blinding light the size of the cottage itself.  After about 3 minutes, they both ran through the beam of light for about 5 feet and got to the back door where their mom was standing inside the door.  When they began toward the house across those five feet, the space ship took off at high speed diagonally in the sky and disappeared.  The UFO made a horendously loud sound as it hovered over them, both girls said.  When their mom tried to go out to see, the girls struggled to keep her in afraid that the space ship would steal her away from them.  She within a minute was out in the back yard and around the front yard looking for evidence of any airplane and it was dark and silent.  The surrounding area did not have many trees and the sky was mostly visible.  There was no trace.  The girls continued to be clingy for the rest of the night.  The mother remembers the lights of the house flickering and for some reason did not barely hear the sound nor react to the calls of the children as would be expected.  She does not understand this at all.  She is a very protective mother and watches her children closely.  What is intruiging to the mother about this incident is that her children had not been exposed to any UFO pictures, books, TV, videos, CDs or even ideas.  They did not watch television, n! or did t hey attend a public school.  They were completely nieve and yet they drew a picture that resembled other UFOs that the mom has seen drawn and described an experience that was truly terrifying and real for them.  She wonders why they felt like the space ship was trying to take them away. Their father has encountered a UFO in another house three years earlier where the sound was so loud he was holding his ears and the light was blinding.  The same mother, his wife  and the two girls much younger were in the house and barely heard the sound and did not see the blinding light.  They were all in the house but in separate rooms.  She wonders what all this means.  Why has her husband and children seen UFOs in her presence when she did not.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
We observed a silent, saucer shaped object with a ring around it with a color and glow resembling the moon.;2002-02-09 21:15:00;20 minutes;We observed a silent, saucer shaped object with a ring around it with a color and glow resembling the moon. We saw a large saucer shaped object which appeared to have a ring around it. It's color changed somewhat from the color of the moon to a soft amber.  It hovered over a distant hill in the state forest, which is unpopulated and a wilderness.  We watched the object move to different positions within the same area without a sound.  At one point we thought the object was coming towards us but reverted back to its' position over the hill.  We watched the object for approximately 20 minutes then it appeared to land behind the hill out of our sight, leaving only a yellow to amber glow highlighting the hill.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
CIGAR/SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT IN STEAMBOAT ISLAND / SUMMIT LAKE AREA;2002-03-22 16:20:00;10 SECONDS;CIGAR/SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT IN STEAMBOAT ISLAND / SUMMIT LAKE AREA AT ABOUT 4:15 PM ON MARCH 22, 2002 I WAS DRIVING SOUTHERLY ON STEAMBOAT ISLAND ROAD IN THE OLYMPIA AREA. ABOVE THE TREES, I WOULD GUESS ABOUT 7-10 MILES AWAY, TO THE NORTHWEST I VIEWED A VERY LARGE SAUCER OR CIGAR SHAPED SHINY SILVER OBJECT, THAT AT FIRST GLANCE I THOUGHT WAS AN AIRPLANE, BUT AT SECOND GLANCE I SAW NO SIGNS OF WINGS OR ANYTHING ELSE. IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MOVING. I TRIED TO GET TO A CLEARING OR HIGHER ELEVATION SO I COULD PHOTOGRAPH IT WITH MY DIGITAL CAMERA. BY THE TIME I DID, IT WAS GONE. THE APPROXIMATE AREA IT APPEARED TO BE IN IS HEAVILY TREED WITH VERY FEW SCATTERED HOMES. DID ANYONE ELSE SEE ANYTHING AROUND THERE LATELY? PRETTY STRANGE, WISH I COULD HAVE GOTTEN A BETTER LOOK, OR A PICTURE.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Bright Glowing Orange-Red Ball in night sky, dropping exploding balls of white light.;2003-01-10 20:00:00;4 minutes;Bright Glowing Orange-Red Ball in night sky, dropping exploding balls of white light. My mom was out on the balcony looking at the stars when she started yelling for me to come out and look at this something she saw. Before I got there, she saw it by the moon (to our far left), about the size of a star and then it started to move North and down it enlarged. It moved quite a distance in a small amount of time, I came to the balcony and watched, by now it was directly in front of us. It continued to move to our right, suddenly stopping and dropping a white light. THe white light came down and made a burst of white light. The light then it continued to fall and another burst of white light came from the ball. It did this several times. The object in the sky then continued off to our right and straight up fading until it dissapeared. The object had a orange-red ball of light in the midst of it and you could see a dark outline disk type shape around the orange-red light. I can honestly say that I've had doubts before, but after seeing that, it was truly creepy. We are wondering if anyone saw this and if anyone could maybe know what possibly the white light that it dropped could be. This was no plane, helicopter or satelite, seen it all, and it was none of that. It made no noise and was extrememly creepy.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Fluorescent green disc near Olympia capitol building;2015-10-19 07:00:00;10 seconds;Fluorescent green disc near Olympia capitol building A fluorescent bright green disc was hovering above the banks of the De Chutes river, with the state capitol building behind it.  It ascended to the height of the second tree line, hovered for a moment,  then proceded north.  I altered my position to get a better view,  taking my eyes off of it for just a moment.   When I looked back up, it was gone.  Thought it was a drone,  but could not find any drones on the internet that would cast such a hue (I have been involved in rc helis and drones for a number of years).  Compared the size to sea gulls flying by, it was larger by at least 3 times;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Black disc near Capital Forest.;2017-12-21 04:12:00;30 seconds;Black disc near Capital Forest. I was driving around Rock Candy Road looking to see if there were any good places for star watching.  I wanted to find a good spot in my area for viewing the space station, away from lights.   I wake up early every day for work and just couldn't fall asleep after I woke up so decided to go for a ride since the sky is clear today.  I did not know if there was a gate to get into Capital Forest, so I drove to check it out.  Just past the parking lot for the trailhead there was a bright flash, everything illuminated like lightening, but there were no clouds and no storms anywhere close.   I stopped my car and got out to look at the sky and grabbed my iPhone.  I saw a black round, maybe disc object maybe 100 feet from me, about 40 feet above the trees.  It made no sound.  My iPhone was completely black, then after a few seconds I saw the apple logo and realized it was rebooting.  I never shut it down, it did this on its own.   The object was only visible by the fact that it block out the sky and made no sound at all.  It moved to the WSW and behind some hills and I couldn't see it anymore.   I got very emotional afterwards and started crying.  I am very skeptical of these sorts of things and have no idea what the object was.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
