I pulled my phone out to record a video, but it didn't happen again. The lights flashed like heat lightning would, but it wasn't a white light.  It was a blue-green flash and then a red flash.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Single flashing bright white lingers in sky as it bounces around and changes direction for 6 minutes.;2018-06-12 23:53:00;6 minutes;Single flashing bright white lingers in sky as it bounces around and changes direction for 6 minutes. I was laying down when I noticed a light in the sky from my bedroom's window.  I got up and looked more closely to see it, initially assuming this was  an airplane with lights on the wings flying at night.  This also made sense to me because it was cloudy tonight.  The weird thing about it was that the light coming from whatever was flying was what seemed like bouncing around in the cloudy skies, but  all the whilst staying in one spot.  The light was bright white.  I then called a friend over to check it out without saying what I was looking at, and then it started to  become very erratic.  The light would bounce and also change direction.  My friend also noticed the flashes had a pattern, it was one flash a slight pause and then 3 quick flashes.  The direction change wasn't extraordinary, just bizarre in the sense that it was not a normal flying pattern for a plane.  My window was also open and there was no sound emitting.  A couple times, in the six minutes of its ! duration,we looked away, once to turn the lights off inside my apartment to get a better look, then again to look for my binoculars, and then again to find a place to report this.  As we were looking for my binoculars, within the span of around less than 20 seconds, we looked at the previous spots it was no longer there or had vanished.   What this flying thing was I have no idea.  To me and my other witness the only thing that was evident, and very clear was this bright bouncing and changing light flashing in a pattern.  We are both young adults.  I am from the Midwest, and he is from the PNW.  I have never seen anything like it.  We considered the possibility of drones and while I don't know what that would look like at night with a flashing light it did hover mainly as it changed directions, however it looked really high and to me in relativity with that height the light must have been massive, or extremely bright.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Flashing lights and eerie mechanical sounds;2021-02-17 01:30:00;10 seconds;Flashing lights and eerie mechanical sounds I was on my phone in bed when I noticed a flashing light coming from outside the window next to me. Immediately after the light, I heard a weird mechanical type of sound. Sounded like something grumbling or a cog in a machine moving. Both the flash and the sound lasted a second each. A few seconds later, another flash happened followed by that same mechanical sound. Both flashes occurred within around a 10 second period.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
