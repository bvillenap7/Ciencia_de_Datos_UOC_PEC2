Once I stopped my car and got out, I could see there was an orange fire on one side of the cone shape however, I am not sure if the orange was on the front or rear end of the moving objects.  There was no sound from them.  They moved in clusters that gradually broke up, as if they were being disbursed by the wind.  After the large group of them had moved nearly out of sight, there was one strangler that trailed along the same path.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
