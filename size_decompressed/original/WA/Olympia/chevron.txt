Saw object flying very fast, noiseless, south to north.;1999-06-02 21:30:00;10 sec.;Saw object flying very fast, noiseless, south to north. Partly cloudy night.  The object was west of me.  It caught my eye as it passed very quickly from cloud to sky.  It didn't make any sound as far as I could tell, given that I can hear every other aircraft that passes anywhere near, since we're pretty much under the Sea-Tac and Olympia airport approach flight paths.  No lights were visible from my angle, anyway.  It's a wonder I noticed it at all given its speed and the dimness of the light.  The speed is what really stood out, and probably what made me notice it.  It was either very small and flying very, very low, or much larger and flying very, very fast.  I think the latter is more probable since I saw it over housetops and trees and it appeared to be some distance away.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
Very large white light that was not a star;2011-09-04 23:00:00;11pm - 5am;Very large white light that was not a star This object appeared to be the brightest star in the sky around 11pm and moved slowly & I mean very slowly, as stars uniformly move over the horizon.  It traveled in a straight line until it stopped just over our home around 4am. which by then looked like a stadium light and appeared to be too low to be a star.  We used our 10x50 binoculars to get a better look & discovered on each side of the main bright light were 3 or 4 tiny lights appearing to be some white & some green.  The peculiar thing is, as daybreak began, it very slowy ascended upward rather than continue across the horizon in uniform with the rest of the stars & by sun up, using the binoculars, you could still see it as a very small light much duller white light.;47.0439493975903;-122.886164156626
