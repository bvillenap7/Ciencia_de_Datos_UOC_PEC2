Fireball over SW Washington;2004-11-27 13:05:00;15 mins;Fireball over SW Washington I witnessed a fireball this past weekend over Cathlamet, Washington.  I origionally thought it was an interesting cloud formation -- a small blob about the size of a full moon with a sort of comet tail -- I didn't think anything of it while i was loading my car for a trip into Longview.  While in my car heading east on SR4 I noticed the formation was still there! (a little lower in the sky) It looked just like a bright comet... tail and all.  About 2 minutes into the trip I remembered I had my digital video camera with me in my computer bag.  I started shooting blindly out the windshield but quickly realised that this was not going to work.  About a mile and a half up the road was a viewing area/turn out that faced the Columbia River where I got out and got decent shots of the fireball.     I have about 90 seconds of fair footage (I am NOT a video film photographer by a long stretch!).... I only wish I started filming a lot sooner.  I reported this to the local astronomy group (Friends of Galileo) who didn't hear of anything expected to be fallen from the sky in our area.  I am sure it is space junk but it was pretty amazing.;46.1918;-123.3684
