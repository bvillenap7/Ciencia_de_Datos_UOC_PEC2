We saw 5 UFO'S the first ufo we saw had 4 large lights white lights in a square formation at the bottom of the coin shaped object the ufo had lights on the rim of it also all white circular lights but smaller than the four large ones.  The first ufo also had red and blue blinking lights in arrows and x formations they were extremely bright.  All five had similiar features they all came from the same place and went to the same place there were about 10 minute intervals between each ufo.  We are all educated people and I myself DO NOT believe in ufo's flying inside our atmosphere until now.  We are all 100% they were not man made aircrafts or any sort of plane we all have seen many planes and strange objects fly over here before but have concluded they are planes we could tell once we saw them.  This sighting is completly different we are sure they were ufo's of extraterristrials.  Please look into this sighting;47.8561;-121.9467
