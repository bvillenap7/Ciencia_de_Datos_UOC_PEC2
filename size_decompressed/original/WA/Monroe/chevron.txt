As I was looking up at the stars,  I noticed what seemed to be a Chevron object, almost with a infrared glow, coming at a very fast rate.  My husband quickly saw it.  It made no noise and left no trail.  I'm going to guess it was about 2,000 feet up.  It moved past us and then we saw a ball of light and it was gone . I have been searching local sites since last night,in Hope's that someone else saw it as well.;47.8561;-121.9467
