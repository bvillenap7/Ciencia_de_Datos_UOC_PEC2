Two red lights in formation traveling south to north at high rate of speed.;2013-04-24 20:20:00;60 seconds;Two red lights in formation traveling south to north at high rate of speed. While enjoying a bonfire, I looked up to see how many stars were visible.  It was then I noticed on the southern horizon what appeared to be two star size, unwavering red lights, what appeared from our vantage to be about a foot apart, on a perfect line.  It travelled south to north at a rate of speed faster than anything we had ever seen.  Turns seemed to be made across a central axis, without a change in formation.  Rate of speed was comparable to that of a shooting star.  The craft appeared to be low flying, and although the moon was visible and casting a lot of light, the lights had no visible body between, behind or in front of them.  After disappearing over the northern horizon, the craft was followed by a loud roaring noise about ten seconds behind, similar to a close proximity jet engine.   The cats appeared agitated by the event, the dog was cowering and the birds fell silent.;47.8561;-121.9467
