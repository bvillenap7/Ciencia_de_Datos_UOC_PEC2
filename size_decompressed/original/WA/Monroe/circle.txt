We initially thought it was a satellite, then a plane, then couldn't make an exact determination as it was traveling too fast to be either, but still slower than a falling star. It moved exactly like a slow moving satellite in that it didn't deviate course, but stayed in an exact line. Unlike a satellite or plane it disappeared when it was directly overhead instead of it remaining visible to the end of the eastern horizon. It appeared to change brightness just before it disappeared, somewhat of a corona around the object or the light simply became more diffuse. We enjoy sky watching and this objects behavior was a first for the both of us. We have seen numerous planes, metorites, and satellites.;47.8561;-121.9467

Then it turned into a blue ring with a smaller red ring inside of it and appeared to be about the size of my thumb.   I then said Hey to my friends - that's not an airplance.    It moved towards the south and went in a straight line right above our heads.  It went very high in the sky and looked like a star, then it dropped fast towards the ground.  It came back up and hovered over head - we tried to take photos will our cell phones,  but our cell phones would not work.   The dot started to drift away from us, went down again real fast, and we thought it was gone.  It suddenly appeared back in our view - then it was gone.   Both of our pets (dog and cat) went crazy afterwards.  They were acting very strange and trying to get outside all night.;47.8561;-121.9467
