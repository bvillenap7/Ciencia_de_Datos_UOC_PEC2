So far, 50+ small star size objects moving across the night sky, appearing to be in low earth orbit.;1999-07-26 23:00:00;All Night;So far, 50+ small star size objects moving across the night sky, appearing to be in low earth orbit. Object move rapidly, constant speed, in a straight line, with no visible trail or sound, from east, west, north and south. Like a shooting star, but with no trail. Just a dot of light moving at high speed across the night sky. Most visible from 9:00PM to 4:00AM. I suspect this is space debris visible in low earth orbit, but I do not know. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites are not visible when they are not being illuminated by the sun, I.e., when they are in the shadow of the earth.  Therefore, anything seen during that time period would not be a satellite.  Also, one would not expect that volume of space junk to be returning to earth.  We do not know what this witness observed.))));47.8561;-121.9467
2 bright flashes that move away from earth;2002-08-23 22:30:00;1 minute;2 bright flashes that move away from earth We were out on the deck about 10 pm when I looked up and saw a bright flash.  I asked my sister if she saw it too.  We watched it begin to ascend and move northward in a straight pattern.  It was moving away from the earth.  We thought it could be a satellite, but another flash occured and began moving away from the earth right after the first one disappeared.  We then noticed a satellite flying by, and knew at that point it wasn't a satellite.  Definetly not a plane, either.;47.8561;-121.9467
2 lights circling each other in sky, then suddenly vanish, and aircraft appears soon thereafter;2003-12-29 18:00:00;1 minute;2 lights circling each other in sky, then suddenly vanish, and aircraft appears soon thereafter About 6pm, I stepped out on front my deck  and noticed a 2 amberish-orange lights in the eastern night sky. They appeared to be circling or revolving around each other, but the movement did not resemble any aircraft I had seen before. After about 3 or 4 seconds of this, one light went out, and the other moved rapidly away, then blinked out. About a second later, in the same part of the sky where the second light blinked out, a set of lights (one flashing white, one pulsing red, and one green) appeared these lights appeared to be some sort of aircraft to me. The lights moved to the left, then to the right, and appeared to go out so I quickly went in the house and shut off the porch light to see better. When I came back outside, they were on again, and were travelling from east to west. I then figured this had to be an aircraft as that I often see a airplanes taking this route, so I went inside.  Wanted to add that my front door faces east, and that I would estimate the lights to have been about 2 or 3 miles away.;47.8561;-121.9467
Bright starlike light seen hovering then speeding out of sight.;2007-11-30 02:25:00;5 mintues;Bright starlike light seen hovering then speeding out of sight. At approximately 2:25 A.M. on the morning of 30 Nov. 2007, I saw in the northern sky a bright whiteish/orange light that looked like a bright star that was stationary in the sky. I was traveling in my car with my wife and daughter. The intensity of the light was that of the brightest star you've ever seen. Probably 2 or 3 times that of Jupiter. As we continued traveling eastward the light remained the same for approximately 30 seconds. We then turned and traveled northward for approximately .25 mile. I then stopped the car and rolled the window down to more closely observe. It was then the object started traveling westward. The intensity of the light diminished to a faint light. It picked up speed as it traveled and went out of sight on the horizon in approximately 3 to 4 seconds. Things to note: There was no sound heard, there were no flashing lights like that of a normal flying aircraft, there was cloud cover with a ceiling of around 10,000 feet. No precipitation.

Very bright light;2008-04-06 21:30:00;45 seconds;Very bright light I seen a very bright white light traveling from NW to the SE. I've seen jetliners all the time going into Seatac airport in Seattle, they approach from the east over the Cascade mountains. I've seen many aircraft flying at night.  This was no aircraft.  There was no noise, and it was brighter than any star or planet, includng the planet venus. I would say it's altitude was about 3000-5000 ft., because it illuminated the clouds that it passed through and the jets weere under the clouds that were coming in to land at the airport.  I woould be interested if anyone else seen this object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));47.8561;-121.9467
2strange lights in the sky;2008-08-10 04:00:00;3-5mins;2 strange lights in the sky I work in Monroe Washington and commute from the dalles, Oregon. I stay there during the week.  Everyday I get up at 2:00am and go to my gym in Lake Stevens, WA. From there I proceed to work which is up in the hills and woods about 12 miles from town  (Monroe). Normally I have about an hour to catch a nap before actually working, I usually pull off to the side of the road a couple of miles from the work site as its in a secured area and the gates are close and locked.  This particular morning I just arrived at my normal dozing spot and saw what resembled a satellite, though somewhat lower appearing. It was moving slow like a satellite does so I watched it for about a minute when a much brighter light appeared over the tree line (easiest way to describe it was imagine the North star the brightest you’ve seen it) it and the ‘satellite’ moved towards one another and they both stopped, right next to each other for about 30 seconds. Then the satellite went back from the way it came!  I was already thinking to myself wow this is interesting. At this point for the sheer hell of it I flashed my lights 3 times. The UFO started directly towards me! It got to what I guess to be about 2 hundred yards (maybe closer) and stopped. I had my windows down and there was absolutely no noise whatsoever. It sat there for about 15 seconds so I flashed it again. Then it was like it leaped up very fast but only a short distance and continued away from me over the wood line in the direction the ‘satellite’ had gone, at a slow speed compared to what I saw when it leaped straight up..  I could not make out any shape of any type of craft that might have been there, but the light honestly resembled a bright star.  I got the impression that what I was looking at couldn’t be any bigger than my Ford Ranger pick-up.  The color of the light was a bright white. It was really bright but seemed to be almost contained somehow. I don’t know, hard to describe.  Anyway, that is what I saw. I went back the next morning hoping to see something else. Nothing occurred.;47.8561;-121.9467
Red/Orange glowing or pulsating light gaining altitude;2009-07-04 22:30:00;1 min;Red/Orange glowing or pulsating light gaining altitude I was going to report this but didn't.  I was waiting to see if anyone else did.   I was watching fireworks from my back yard looking over the city of Monroe, Wa,. when I saw a glowing red/orange glowing or pulsating spot of light.  My wife was in the kitchen, I called her out to witness.   Object was South and appeared to hover or be moving southerly and gaining altitude away from my location.  We watched it for 1 to 2 minutes.  Object was very high in altidude and above normal flight and landing paths.  Estimating at well over 30,000ft.  If I was to guess its location I would say it was just southwest of Mt.Rainier.  I have various experiences with military aircraft and this was not one.  I also have viewed atmosphere and rocket tests from Vandenburg AFB.  This was not one.  This was not a star, planet, flare, swamp gas or weather balloon.  Very doubtfull this was some sort of test from the space station or other man-made object in orbit.   Judging by the distance from my point of view, and using the size and location of Mt.Rainier as a reference, the object was many times greater in size than a Boeing 747.;47.8561;-121.9467
Triangular UFO sighting;2009-07-04 22:30:00;3-4 minutes;Triangular UFO sighting We saw 3 orange lights flying in a triangular formation.  They flew slowly in formation from west to east.  The orange lights did not waver or blink. It looked like the space station looks when observed moving through the sky.  Two disappeared then the third disappeared.  One reappeared in the same area of the sky for 2-3 minutes.  The sky was very clear. We were a group of middle-aged professionals watching fireworks.;47.8561;-121.9467
Single white light turned into 5 flashing lights in a row.;2010-10-05 23:00:00;15sec;Single white light turned into 5 flashing lights in a row. Came from left to right over the tree line in our back yard. I live near an airport so at first I thought was a play flying late at night but then when the lights flashed it caught me off guard.  From the center light then flash 2 lights and each side evenly spaced all white.  The craft seemed move every slow no more then 35 to 50 mph and I'd say with in 10 miles.  When it went behind a tree I tried to move to better view and lost it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));47.8561;-121.9467

Light was very bright blue, at first I thought it was a star but it did;2014-10-19 22:00:00;2 minutes;Saw blue light low on horizon, hard to determine distance away. Light was very bright blue, at first I thought it was a star but it didn't twinkle and was too low. I was looking to the north east and it appeared farther than the houses about 2000 feet away. From my perspective it was about a foot off the roofline of those houses. After viewing for about a minute it appeared to fade out, changining to a red color then coming back to blue. As we were watching it the light went up rather quickly, while staying blue. From my perspective it was about 20 feet off the roofline. The light then dropped down below the roofline after about 25 seconds. Didn't see it anymore after that. My guess is it was either far away but there are mountains in the backdrop or it was very small and closer. Personal drone maybe?;47.8561;-121.9467
