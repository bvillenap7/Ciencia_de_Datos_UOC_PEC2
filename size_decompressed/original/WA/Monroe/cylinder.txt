My girlfriend and I were just coming back from Stevens Pass when I looked up and saw a circular(kind of lit up, maybe just shiny)object,crossing the sky at about a 15 degree angle. The object was heading south from the North.  The sky was dusk, not dark out, though. I could see the object come across the sky at an angle and then shoot back towards the same direction it came from, going about half the way from where I had seen it at first. Then it was gone. It did not turn around, it just automatically shot backwards, in the direction it came from, then disappeared. It was moving VERY quickly.  I asked my girlfriend if she had seen it. She did not. Took so long to report it for fear of being called silly. I did see something. Too quick to be man made.;47.8561;-121.9467
