Bright light seen three seperate times in a space of three and a half hours.;2011-08-26 20:30:00;30 seconds;Bright light seen three seperate times in a space of three and a half hours. At approximately 20:30 hr., I saw what I thought at first was the Space Station. The difference was it was traveling from the East towards the West. It caught my eye because it was a very bright white light and moving much like I have wittnessed the ISS move in the night sky. What I saw did not move in a straight line and did not disappear over the horrizon.  It made a swooping move that reminds me of the Nike logo in reverse.  It was very bright right up to the arch portion and progressively dimmed moving away from us, yet remaining visible in the night sky.  There was no discernable shape, noise, or flashing lights. What I and my Wife did see returned three times with approximately 20 to 45 minute intervals. It was clearly visible with the naked eye. We live in the flight path of Seattle and Everett Airports and know what aircraft look like in the sky. This did not appear to be any type of aircraft, just a bright light. We both wittnessed it three times. I brought out my night vision monocular and watched for it for about 3 and a half hours. Each sighting was with the naked eye and twice I was able to track it with the night vision. As it swung into the upper swoosh of the arch and became dimmer, I was able to see it become almost stationary for short times then disappear. Also, with the night vision I tracked several sattelites crossing the sky in South to North lines.  What I call sattelites could have been a UFO siting as well.  On two sitings I saw a singular motion enjoined with a second moving almost parralell tracking in the same direction except for one.  The one unusual siting I tracked from the North towards the South which was enjoined by a second that had been heading in the opposite direction. When I claim it 'enjoined' tracking the first, I mean it turned in behind the first I was tracking and they traveled for a distance across the sky and then both stopped. I watched them for a short time and brought the night vision down and lost track of their location in the mix of stars.;47.8561;-121.9467
Neon blue and 2 red lights not a plane.;2014-03-27 19:45:00;1.5 minutes;Neon blue and 2 red lights not a plane. Saw a blue light raveling slowly from south to north.  Then 2 red lights turned on, one on each side of blue light.  The object appeared to stop for a moment then back up.  After about 20 sec.  It moved to the NE at a high rate of speed.;47.8561;-121.9467
we thought they were planes at first but planes do not fade in and out;2020-10-14 19:30:00;20-30 minutes;we thought they were planes at first but planes do not fade in and out 3 or 4 ships ..blinking and fading in and out..they changed positions from a triangle to a straight line ..one above the other and the top one moved to the right and slowly off blinking like an airplane and faded away and came back to the group and repeated the move.  The others would kind of circle around and come back into the triangle form and line up again.  This went on for 20 minutes or more.  The color was bright gold and again they faded in and out.;47.8561;-121.9467
