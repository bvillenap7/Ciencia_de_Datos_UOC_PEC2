STOP AND GO THE SIZE OF A LARG CAR WITH NO WINDOWS;1972-10-01 23:00:00;15 MIN;STOP AND GO THE SIZE OF A LARG CAR WITH NO WINDOWS LATE AT NIGHT, NO OTHER CARS ON ROAD. I SAW A BRIGHT FLOOD LIGHT  APPROX 100 FEET OFF ROADAND 25 FEET OFF GROUND. I THOUGHT IT WAS SEARCH CHOPPER. I STOPED MY TRUCK AND WATCHED THE LIGHT MOVE AWAY AND UP BEHIND A CLEAR CUT PART OF THE HILLS. AS THE LIGHT MOVED I NEVER SAW ANY AIR BLAST ASSOICATED WITH ROTER CRAFT. THE CRAFT TRAVELED AT A SLOW RATE OF SPEED WITH SEARCH LIGHT ON IN THE SAME DIRECTION I WAS GOING. WE WERE STILL SEPERATED BY TREES. ABOUT TWO MILES DOWN THE ROAD THE CRAFT SHUT OFF ITS LIGHTS AND TURNED ON RED AND GREEN NAV LIGHTS. I STOPED THE TRUCK ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOW , I COULD NOT HEAR ANY SOUND!!!!!!! THE HAIR ON MY NECK STOOD UP AND I TRIED TO GET HELL OUT OF DODGE. THE CRAFT FLEW DOWN ON TOP OF MY TRUCK JUST AS I CAME TO A LOW POWER LINE. IT SWOOPED DOWN AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED UNDER THE POWER LINES AND STOPED ABOUT ONE FOOT OFF THE ROAD IN MY HEAD LIGHTS . IT THEN TURNED LEFT AND AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED SPED UPTHE POWER LINE ROAD. A SECOND CRAFT STAYED OFF TO MY LEFT IN THE TREES. I FLY AIR CRAFT AND WHAT I SAW CAN'T BE DONE BY ANYTHING ON THIS ROCK. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));47.8561;-121.9467

The object was bar shaped, very shinny and metallic and very high in the sky.  They were not moving across the sky like an airplane, they seemed to be hovering.  The fist one flashed when the sun hit it....the second day I was in traffic and noticed the same type of thing.  I asked my Step daughter if she saw it and as I asked the object sort of turned on it's side and absolutely disappeared from site...I lost my breath and thought I was going crazy!  I have never seen an UFO before in my life and all of a sudden my sister and I have seen on 2 seperate occasions weird things in the sky, and then I see these two things on my own...STRANGE! My sister in law and brother in law saw a formation of the same type of object I am describing during the day towards Federal Way.;47.8561;-121.9467
