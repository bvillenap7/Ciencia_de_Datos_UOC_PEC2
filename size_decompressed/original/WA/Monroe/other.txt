sighting from the past;1988-07-10 21:00:00;5 min;sighting from the past This past Labor day weekend my daughter and her family came to visit me at my home on Whidbey island, north of Seattle Washington. We were roasting marshmallows with the grandkids on the beach one night, and the subject of UFO's came up.  My daughter re-capped an incident that I had long since forgotten about, mostly because at that time I was skeptical and didnâ€™t have time to think of such things as UFO's.  This happened about 19 years ago, but I think is worth passing on.  It involved my daughter (16 at the time) and her mother, the location was near Monroe Washington.   Quote:  Mom picked me up at the Dairy Queen, where I was working part time during the summer months before school started. It was dusk at the time, we drove up the woods creek road towards home.  As we drove along we saw a bright light ahead and as we neared it and saw what a strange thing we were looking at, Mom pulled our car to a stop, lowered the windows and shut the motor off. We gazed in amazement at what we saw, it was a football shaped craft with several lights from front to back. It was hovering over a dairy farm field, perhaps a hundred feet off the ground, I would guess it was about 30 feet in length. It made no sound at all, we had our windows down and our motor was shut off. After just a few minutes it started moving slowly up the valley (north). Mom started the car and we stayed along with it for about a mile, it then turned to the left (west), increased in speed and shot out of sight like a bullet. End of quote..  My daughter is and has always been a responsible person, you can take what she says to the bank.   I myself filed a report a few years back on strange lights observed by my hunting partners and I near Coulee Dam Wa. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.
