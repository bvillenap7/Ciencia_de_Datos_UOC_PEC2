I was at 'Cedar Ponds', a description given TO ME by one who drove a wedding and band occured, after the din I found a place to recline on lakes' edge, to watch the FULL MOON RISE. Nice evening, not a cloud, starlit sky like Montana.  As I watched the moon cut a vertical through spindly trees on (the EAST-SIDE ?) the reflection on the water was not really noticed, as I was laying on my back, hands cradling my head, watching the ORB ASCEND. THEN...........a starlight went out to my left, AND THE FEEBLE DIRECTION DESCRIPTION NOW GIVEN: (feet AT 12:00, 10 o'clock WAS LIGHT-BLINK, and 100 feet above the water, traveling on NORTH-TO-SOUTH CENTERLINE OF LAKE). THE INVOLUNTARY 'LOOKING' AT A LIGHT THAT BLINKED OUT......... WELL, THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON, AND I SAW A DARKER-THAN-SKY TRIANGULAR OBJECT..............NO LIGHTS..........NO TURBINES OR ANY OTHER SOUND.......... TRIANGULAR........70' LONG.............50' WIDE............and now before What ((deleted))???? went through my head..........the objects' belly reflected 10 to 20% TO ME AS THE OBJECT APEXED ME AND THE MOON. WELL MORE LIKE LIGHT-ABSORBED 80% OF THE FULL MOON'S REFLECTION !!!    JUST A GLIMPSE OF WONDERFUL TECHNOLOGY: the 'tiles looked 3' long, 2' wide, butted perp. and staggered, to form an interesting pattern that could absorb or deflect...............YOU WORK ON IT. Tail of delta was 20-30' high at apex, flat-assed, and had three dull, dull, orange circles 6 'dia. in each vertex. The object moved 30mph..............my impression: Of being observed as though it was a 'tour bus' from the future.............. PROMPT: AND NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  STARBOARD YOU WILL NOTICE ONE RECLINING AT WATER'S EDGE, ENJOYING THE SUMMER'S EVENING..............................................then disappeared over the tree tops. I replayed my observation, wrote everything down, and have kept quiet. I WAS WELL RESTED, NOT PREOCCUPIED BY ANY ALCOHOL OR DRUG. BACKGROUNDDEGREE ELECTRONICS, F.C.C.

SHORTLY AFTER THIS 'OBSERVATION', ON A SHOW CALLED THE X-FILES, THE ACTOR CALLED MULDER HELD A PHOTOGRAPH OF A DELTA-SHAPED AIRBORNE OBJECT.  Now you may understand my apprehension at the time:  1. Just one OF THE WAVE OF 'I SAW ITS', to respond to this query.....no thanks.   2. A personal decision for the 'private experience' to remain my own.  3. If the craft WERE OUT FOR A CRUISE, then any source-acknowledgement-discovery would be realized as a WEAK SPOT and will have to be worked upon.  I felt no atmosphere disturbance as She passed, nor sensed any ultrasonics.........................but to feign pointing towards the object and murmur OVERHEAD.......

Just wanted to let ENOUGH TIME HAS ELAPSED THAT MY APPREHENSION HAS WANED to know that I also witnessed the object that night.  There couldnt be a better description, I can only add to it by saying that if it was an airplane, it would have stalled and fell from the sky. ((END ADDENDUM));47.8561;-121.9467
Delta-winged craft with no noise streaks over skylight.;2014-09-02 10:15:00;3 seconds;Delta winged craft with no noise streaks over skylight. Spotted a dark blue/gray triangle shaped craft crossing over skylight just above the low clouds.   Anticipated some kind of jet engine noise but there was none and no sonic boom.   Traveling north to south at very high speed, thus the short observation time.;47.8561;-121.9467
