Strange light seen hovering around the moon.;2009-05-31 19:30:00;15 minutes;Strange light seen hovering around the moon. While working in the back yard with my girlfriend I happened to look up and see what looked like a planet positioned 3-5 moons towards the left of the moon. The moon was approximately 45 to 60 degrees angle from my position. I told my girlfriend to look and then the object slowly moved in front of the moon. It appeared to have light and looked similar to venus or mars when present later in the afternoon when the sun is still out. After the object moved in front of the moon it then dropped about 10 moons down below the moon where it held a position for approximately 10 minutes. After trying to observe the object with binoculars it soon faded and then disappeared. After making a few phone calls it appeared once again about 7-10 minutes later and looked different and more like an orange balloon. It once again was above the moon about 3 moons to the upper right and then dropped below the moon to the right and held its position for about 5 minutes then disappeared.;47.8561;-121.9467
