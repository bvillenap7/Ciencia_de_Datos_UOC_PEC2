Triangle fire-like ball over Burlington;2011-12-25 19:55:00;10 minutes;Triangle fire-like ball over Burlington We started out on the main road heading home when up in the sky I witnessed a triangle of firelike balls in the sky in the direction of the airport. Upon my pressing my girlfriend we went closer to the triangle and the the two lower fireballs disappeared but the top fireball was still in place.  We stopped by the road where a blue truckful of guys about four of them also saw it and took a video of it. As we kept watching it, it was speeding up in the direction of Sedro Woolley at a medium speed.;48.4776;-122.3445
