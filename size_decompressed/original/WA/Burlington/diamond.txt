I was taking my usual walk down the dike, when I noticed 3 dimond-shaped objects in the sky. They were travling VERY fast and they sometimes changed shape and color. The main color was blue but they were also silverish for a while. The main shape was dimond but sometimes cigar shaped. Seamed to be going up and down.;48.4776;-122.3445
