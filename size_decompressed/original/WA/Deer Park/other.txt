It was in the East skies slowly moving toward the West skies.  My 5 year old sister was with me. It sort of looked light the Little Dipper.  May have been the constellation of Auriga. Little Dipper should not have been in the region at the time, though.   We also heard buzzing noises.  It was over a field, not the mountains.  They're was an assortment of red, green and blue lights.  Maybe a satellite, but doubt it.  They just slowly moved across the sky.  There was only one object. This is all of the information I was able to collect before it disappeared.  It kind of faded away, not just disappeared.   It freaked me out so I thought I ought to report it.;47.9519;-117.4735
