On 9/25/2010 at approximately 8:30PM my wife and I observed hovering in a perfectly clear evening sky what shall be  described as a run of the mill UFO.  By that I mean, the object, sighted directly south of Deer Park  Washington at  a distance of approximately 8-10 miles displayed a bright white orb emitting brilliant red. white and blue  sparkeling flashes.  It hovered motionless for a few minutes after first being spotted.  I ran into the house for my  camera, but when I returned in less than 30 seconds, it had moved approximately five miles to the south and  continued to move in a nominal ballistic arc sweeping westward. The brilliant flashes lights were no longer visible  and only a single small flash continued to be emitted from the UFO. We agreed between ourselves that this was no  helicopter because of the intensity of the white light and the brilliance of the flashing colored lights.;47.9519;-117.4735
