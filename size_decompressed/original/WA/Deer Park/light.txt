The object in question was either a ball of light or was emmiting enough of it to make it look like it was made of light, but it made absolutely no sound. I was standing on the side of a road beside a field when my neighbor pointed out a, what looked like to be, even though distance was hard to tell at 8:50 at night, so I had no idea how big it was, a flying object. It was going diagonally towards the ground, in my view point, what looked like a southernly direction. While it was doing this, it was changing from a white, to a dull green, to a dim light blue, to a dark yellow, then, it faded away quickly, leaving no trace, sound, or, smell, behind. ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain of the date.  The witness did not fill in the date box completely.  However, we assume that he may have meant the date of 25AU01.  PD));47.9519;-117.4735
fast moving light filmed over deer park WA.;2010-08-13 00:13:00;40 seconds;fast moving light filmed over deer park WA. Very high and fast object flew over Deer park WA. while camping with a friend.   While admiring the full brilliance of the stars in a dark area we observed a fast moving light across the sky coming in from the north west of my position and leaving our view in the south west in just 40 seconds much higher than an airplane normally flies, and gave off a red reflection at 11 seconds.   Have a video from my sony w55 which took several seconds to get the video started so the video is the last 32 seconds.;47.9519;-117.4735
Bright white star-like light flashes then disappeared.;2012-09-18 03:29:00;2 seconds;Bright white star-like light flashes then disappeared. At 3:29 AM I went outside during a break from writing. Looked up into the sky and saw a bright white flash. The light was in one position and was not moving in any direction from what I could tell. Within approximately 2 seconds of my eyes being dead on this object which looked much like a bright star. It flashed and before my eyes could readjust the light was gone. I waited around and searched the area and surrounding area (if you were looking dead up into the sky the object was near 2 o'clock north.) I saw nothing but black night sky.;47.9519;-117.4735
