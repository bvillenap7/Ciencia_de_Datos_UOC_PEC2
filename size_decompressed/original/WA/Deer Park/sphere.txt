Orange orbs with beams of light.;2014-04-27 22:34:00;5-10 minutes;Orange orbs with beams of light. My husband was sitting on the couch looking out at the stars and he suddenly called to me.   We ran outside and I noticed two bright orange orbs with perfect beams of light pouring out from all sides, moving across the sky.   I ran to get my teenage kids up to come and see.  Once they had reached a position almost directly above our field they stopped and held still.  They were pretty high up, near cloud level.  Then, one disappeared.  Several minutes later the other disappeared as well.  It was then we noticed two others that were not moving at all. Shortly after I tried to take out dog out to eliminate, but he refused.;47.9519;-117.4735
