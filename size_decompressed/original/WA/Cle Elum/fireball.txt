7-9 orange glowing objects traveling north/northeast right at the tree line.;2015-12-30 22:00:00;15 minutes;7-9 orange glowing objects traveling north/northeast right at the tree line. 2 objects glowing orange traveling north/northeast went in and grabbed my dad and son so they could see as well, when they came out we all witnessed 5-7 more objects traveling the same path and speed, the last two objects were traveling a little quicker and changed their flight path just slightly but still traveling same direction.   They seemed to be about a mile and a half away (relatively on the Stuart range/dingbat basin area) no sound whatsoever came from objects.;47.2072;-120.967
Orange ball of light shoots down to Blowout Mountain, Wa 98022 visible from Cle Elum.  ((anonymous report));2018-03-16 21:15:00;>5 seconds;Orange ball of light shoots down to Blowout Mountain, Wa 98022 visible from Cle Elum. Was on cellphone at the time, looked up to the sky (facing South-West) and saw a orange/red, VERY BRIGHT, completely silent, flaming ball of light shoot from the sky straight down (perpendicular) to earth.  I was in Cle Elum Wa, 98922.  My best guess is it dropped from the sky to roughly Blowout Mountain in Washington State, 98022.  It was out of view after dropping past the mountain range.  No one else saw it from what I know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous  PD));47.2072;-120.967
