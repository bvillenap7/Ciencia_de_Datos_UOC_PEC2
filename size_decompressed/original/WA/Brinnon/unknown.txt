pulsating lights in southern sky;2003-02-10 04:00:00;about 40 minutes;pulsating lights in southern sky About 3:55 am 2/10/93 I looked into the southern sky and saw pulsating lights and no real source.  They continued and at first I thought it was lightening but no.  Then I thought maybe a tower, but no.  I did not hear any flying object or hear any other noise.  The lights continued pulsating over different places in the sky and not always in the same way.  I have never seen anything like it.  I contacted a couple of local TV stations and one did say they contacted the FAA but no record of anything.  These lights lasted about 40 minutes and I am curious if anyone else saw this.
