As an amateur astronomer, I knew it could not be Venus as she had set at least two hours prior.  The object did not move at all, just hovering in the distance.  I took a look with my high powered binoculars and as I did, it appeared to be a bright glowing white orb which then morphed into a cigar shape and back to an orb.  After about 20-30 minutes it simply disappeared into thin air!!!;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
