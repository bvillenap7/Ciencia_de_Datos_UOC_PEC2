It would travel one way then the other maybe 90' or so.  Did not think much but I began to notice it didn't have any nav lights, beacons or strobes and I found that odd.  It traveled at aprox. 120-200 knots, about what I would expect of a aircraft.  We are close to Felts Field but the tower was closed at this time and it was not in the pattern or even close and it was not on approach to Spokane Int or Fairchild AFB.   I had my cell phone camera and decided to take about 20 pictures. I forgot about them then the other day I looked at them and noticed a object above the bright light.  It seems to take several different forms and changes form.  I realized my phone was a video also and took a video and in the video, on frame by frame play only you can see the object! go behind the bright light then back which you could not see at normal speed.  Also you can hear the sound of what sounds like a jet aircraft but during this all I heard nothing.  I did have my truck running during most of the time which would have covered any sounds but when I turned it off I don't recall any sounds.  I have a extensive aviation background, could fly before I could drive, lived on a airport, father is a retired 747 pilot, I know aircraft and this was not any type known to myself.  I don't have any idea what it is and I find it very interesting, whatever it is?;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Silver cylinder no wings no sound.;2014-10-27 11:00:00;15 minutes;Silver cylinder no wings no sound. A very brief sighting in that I noticed this object the size of a normal passenger  airline except it had no wings.  It was flying south east of my location at a hight lower than normal.  I was entering  at park with trees, by the time I was able to get another clear look at it no longer was it visible. A clear day blue sky not a cloud.  This object was silver not a normal silver I donâ€™t know what made it different in color it just was.  And thats about all I have with me a good cam maybe next time.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
