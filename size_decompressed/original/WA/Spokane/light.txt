UFO over active USAF B-52 base, controllers ask civilian pilots to identify...;1992-11-01 04:30:00;2-4 minutes;UFO over active USAF B-52 base, controllers ask civilian pilots to identify... I was working as a non-scheduled, on demand, commercial pilot for a company that was based in Wenatchee, WA.  I haven't checked the actual date in my logbook that this occurrence happened yet, but I estimate that it was late fall in 1992 (I'll verify).  Another pilot and I were paged at roughly 11:00 and informed that we would be picking up a United Airlines maintenance crew and tools at SEA and flying them to GEG to repair a 747, standby and then return them if they completed their task.  We were wheels up before 00:00 from EAT, picked up the maintenance crew/tools by 01:30 and arrived at GEG estimated 03:00.  After standing by for roughly 1.5-2.0 hrs, we were released to return as the crew would not be able to complete in a known duration. It was my leg as captain and we departed approximately 04:30-05:00.  It was a very low ceiling inversion that was only 200-300 ft and CAVU weather above. Immediately after departure, GEG tower informed us to contact Fairchild AFB instead of the usual/expected issuance of departure frequency.  The first officer contacted Fairchild and immediately after affirmation they advised us of traffic at 6:00 type/altitude unknown, unusual call in that we it was not just IMC conditions, but we were transiting over an active military airfield.  Several call and responses were delivered as they reported traffic rapidly moving from the 6 position to obviously overtaking us on the right side of out aircraft.  First officer didn't see until it was at out 3  position out of the eyebrow window above his seat.  At this point it was estimated to be several hundred above our altitude (we were still in a climb) and moved at such a rapid rate, later conversation between us confirmed that no typical aircraft could move at this rate.  When the UFO was off our nose and above us and in plain view, it literally went vertical and was gone in what we estimated to be 5 seconds. My first officer was very disturbed by this event and pursued getting civilian and military ATC tapes, but the military apparently doesn't need to release these transmissions unless requested from an entity other than a civilian.  He was a very devout Christian and had a difficult time post incident accepting what we had witnessed that morning. This was not my only incident, just one of them.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Large bright red light, size of Venus at its brightest, observed over Spokane, Wa. at 1:00 a.m. on April 22, for about 20 minutes. Appe;1997-04-22 01:00:00;20 minutes;Summary : Large bright red light, size of Venus at its brightest, observed over Spokane, Wa. at 1:00 a.m. on April 22, for about 20 minutes. Appeared stationary, then moved slowly upward and disappeared. No sound. No apparent explanation. Large bright red (not orange) star-like light (at first described as Mars, but was not) seen in northern sky at about 30 degree angle, at 1:00 a.m., on April 22, 1997 in Spokane, Wa.. Too big to be a satellite, and not blinking or moving fast enough to be a plane or helicopter. (It would have been too low to be a plane without some sound.)  No sound accompanying this event.  Clear night.  Full moon.  Light as large as Venus might appear at its brightest, but stop-light red.  No other object that color in sky.  Only faint stars in that direction.  Appeared to be stationary, but with continued viewing seemed to very slowly move upward and between two distant stars, about 5-10 more degrees.  Then as I watched, it was just gone.  Obseverved by educated woman teacher and adult son for about 20 minutes in large backyard away from city lights. No drugs or alcohol.  No apparent explanation for sighting, as much as we tried to explain it away.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
ultra-violet sphere hovered two hours no sound 200 yd.s away 100Ft in air;1997-12-27 20:00:00;2 hours;ultra-violet sphere hovered two hours no sound 200 yd.s away 100Ft in air I groomed ski slope for 5 yr.s on MT. Spokane. I did not realize exactly what I was seeing untill about 2002. I believe what I observed was the plasma ball caused by the electro magnetic field around the craft.  I could not see craft itself. Looked like a very large black light (ultra violet) at least 80ft. diameter as I had trees and ridge line to judge size and distance. Closest I got to the thing was about 200 yd.s I first observed it from the maintence shop about 8:pm took sno-cat up MT. was able to still see it most of time as I had to manauver around the MT.. Was able to get above it and observe from top of MT. Where it hovered at, was about 100 ft. above what is the mountaineers lodge, well below the ridge lines of the Mt. and adjoining ridge (curves around). This thing hovered in the same spot two yr.s in a row on the same date between the same time 8: to 10:pm (could have been there same time every yr. as it could have been storming snow or real foggy? The strangest thing about this is that both yr.s the other groomer (different guys each yr.) could not see the thing even standing next to me pointing straight at it. This was something you could not miss. Like looking at a red barn at 100 yd.s away.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Light was stationary, something about it kept drawing eyes to it as it was very bright.Seemed to move and when looked directly at it, i;1998-04-14 03:20:00;2 min;Light was stationary, something about it kept drawing eyes to it as it was very bright.Seemed to move and when looked directly at it, it would be still. Noticed an airplane directly above and focused on plane(had aviation lights). Suddenly LIGHT bolted across the sky directly at the plane.Right before it would have hit plane, the light just sucked up in nothing and vanished. WOULD SURE LIKE TO FIND THIS PILOT!!! Were sitting on porch in quiet north Spokane neighborhood.Time was approx:3:20am.Apr.14 98(approx.) Clear night. Earlier had been out to some clubs. Alcohol was taken, however, this was not an incident caused by same. As i said, we were sitting on front porch talking, listening to music. I smoke, so was outside.Friend was inside changing music. I kept noticing a bright light in the south sky(my vantage was facing east with a 4 ft.porch overhang above me. Clear view to the EAST-SOUTH- AND NORTH. Out of the corner of my eye I kept noticing a bright light to the South, like it was moving.But when I would look directly at it,it seemed to be stationary. It also seemed to get brighter everytime I would notice it.(maybe that was just me?) After a few mins. a light drew my attention from directly overhead. This was obviously a plane as it had the flashing aviation lights. As I was looking up at the plane (probably within about 15 sec.) I was drawn back to the light in the South.Within  2 sec. the light got really bright and darted across the sky directly at the plane.(not sure of size of plane, but it was high up) I was looking directly at the event.My guess is this thing covered about 5 to 10 miles in an instant. (About the length of 1 1/2 Big Dippers). As it approached the plane, instead of hitting it,as it was on a collision course with the plane,it was like it just Sucked up and vanished right before contact.That is the best way I can describe it. My friend just happened to come back outside just as the light started to move across the sky and he saw it,too. I started jumping around saying to him, ''did you frickin see that''? Probably woke some people up.He saw this too and was quite freaked by it. We talked about it again the next day. Kind of checking ourselves as to, if we really saw what we thought we saw. WE DID!! WOULD SURE LIKE TO FIND THE PILOT OF THIS PLANE. There is no way that the pilot didn't see this thing coming at him! Can you search some way to maybe find this plane and pilot?;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
looking north over the spires of Gonzaga University sighted a small, pea sized, light travelling west to east approx 45 degrees above t;1998-05-21 02:50:00;4 seconds;looking north over the spires of Gonzaga University sighted a small, pea sized, light travelling west to east approx 45 degrees above the horizon At 2:30 AM,on 5\21\98, while talking my usual lunchtime walk on the centenial trail between the USPS main annex and Gonzaga University I looked north off the bridge crossing the Spokane River and sighted a lighted objected travelling west to east at approx 45 degrees above the horizon.  Est the size to be about the size of a pea held at arms length and of a blueish white color.  No noise was heard which is what caught my attention. Also, most aircraft travel in an east west direction as the airport and airbase are southwest of the city.  Speed was more consistent with that of a jet coming in for landing - slow and steady - covering approx six inches of sky in, I guess, four seconds.  At this point the object simply disappeared - I thought it may have gone behind a cloud but it never reappeared.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Silent erratic lights cross dry non-traversable  lakebed, then chase observer at high speeds.;1999-06-01 20:15:00;3 min;Silent erratic lights cross dry non-traversable  lakebed, then chase observer at high speeds. On the warm evening in June of 1999, It was just getting dark, I lived above the Salteese flats, a drained lake bed, that is swampy till late summer.  My car window was down, I noticed on the far side of the lake bed, aprox: 1/4 to 1/2 mile away.  There was a set of very bright lights with smaller green lights behind moving back and forth on what I first thought was the road across the lake bed. I stopped to observe the erratic behavior.  After 20 seconds or so, I realized the object was below the road, and switching directions too quickly for it to be a car.  I wondered maybe a helicopter?, but there was no sound and I know that sound carries well across that marshy land.  I then realized that the object had turned 90 degrees and was then headed straight at my car, still no sound.  I know there is no path in that area for any vehicle to traverse without getting bogged down.  I also realized it was flying too high to be a car on the ground.  I put my car in gear and! decided to move down the road out of the way.  The object arrived on the road on my side of the road and again did a sharp 90 degree turn in my direction, I then became very alarmed so I accelerated my car to the point of unsafe speed.  Keeping my eyes on road and rear view mirror I saw the object was now following me at speeds 55 mph on winding  roads.  All I could see in the rear mirror was now two lights brighter than any halogen lights I've ever seen, blinding me in the mirror.  I was now terrified and kept thinking please god let me get home so I can tell my husband.  I hit the crest of the steep hill still doing 50 mph. At that point I was 90 seconds from my drive way.  But I do not remember pulling into the drive or entering the house, let alone telling my husband what had just occurred.  The next I recalled was getting up the next morning. I had been terrified but did not even recollect the event till over a week later.  No matter what has ever happened, I have always talked to my spouse.  All I wanted was to survive to tell my spouse, yet I did not remember.  Nor am I given to hysteria.  My mind is completely blank as to the end of that event, yet I recall every last detail leading up to it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Saw a light similar to a star that darted around the sky in straight lines.;1999-08-15 23:00:00;10 minutes;Saw a light similar to a star that darted around the sky in straight lines. My girlfriend and I drove out the Palouse Hwy one evening to find a secluded place.  We were just outside of town and drove up a dirt road that put us into the northwest shadow of Tower Mtn.  We could see the finger shaped rocks that you cannot see from the Dishman-Mica area.  We found a spot and did our business. Afterwards we were just relaxing on a blanket in a field on a hillside looking up at the stars.  We noticed a small star that would move rapidly in a straight line one direction not very far at all then stop abruptly and change its trajectory.  This went on for a few minutes and we decided to bail, quickly, and drove back to her parent’s house. I cannot recall the conversation we had on the drive, I do recall driving fast down that dirt road though. The next day I was at work and my closest co-worker, a few years older than me, asked me if I had seen anything strange in the sky.  Our sightings were very similar. I remember it so clearly.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Large round bright green light moving quickly across the sky.;1999-09-11 20:24:00;6-10sec;Large round bright green light moving quickly across the sky. I was sitting at the kitchen table facing a sliding glass door. It was dark out, approx. 8:20 p.m. Sept 11, 1999. Relatives were visiting that evening. I saw a large bright, green light in the sky, moving from the east to the west.It was like the size of a full distant moon. It moved fast and low in the sky. We have tall trees all around us on the horizon. It angled downward and acroos the sky ,and as I jumped up and ran to the door and opened it, the light dropped behind the hillside. There was no tail, no noise, except the neighbor dog barking. No one else saw the light as they were not facing the windows. We all looked and listened for a few moments. I have never seen anything like this.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

The first time we watched fo;2000-12-18 17:00:00;2 hours;We have actually seen a light very bright on three different occasions all three times have been at night. The first time we watched for about two hours. A very bright light, too bright to be a star, that hovers for just about in the same place for several hours, but during that time it will move sideways, stop hover, then move in half circles,then stop and hover again. At one point it started moving very fast toward us (my husband & myself) then it stopped again and hovered. An airplane doesnt hover for several hours in the same place. It has been very cold so we have watched it then gone inside to get warm, then it will at some point be gone when we return outside to look at it. Our dog warned us about it the first time I saw it, he was barking and going nuts. As soon as we spotted it, the dog settled down. Thats the way he reports things to us. He did the same thing when there was an automobile accident on our road. We love about 15 miles from Spokane out in the country. On one occasion we called our neighbor across the road, and he said he has been watching this strange light for several months now. Hasn't said anything to anybody because he didnt want anyone to think he was crazy. My husband and I on one occasion went driving to the direction of it and when we got to just about where it should have been it was gone. We have seen it on three different nights, so far. I guess thats about it.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
I was up working late, I work from my home, I am 15 miles south of Spokane, WA I heard a loud noise above my sewing machine and stereo,;2001-11-15 01:30:00;1 hour;I was up working late, I work from my home, I am 15 miles south of Spokane, WA I heard a loud noise above my sewing machine and stereo, I turned off the stereo and went out of my front door, facing north, I saw two distinct lights, one was red, one ws white, both so bright and strobing so fast that I could not make out a shape. It was very big as it was just above the tree tops, I have 6 large pine trees in my front yard, this thing was passing over very slowly. I know it was not a plane as it was far too low, and not a helecopter as it was not that type of noise. It was loud, and it passed completely over the house, going south, I then went to a southern window watched it proceed about 1/4 mile over a field to a tree line that goes into a wooded area. I then saw another light white, at the edge of the tree line also. This light was not strobing like the other was. The one that was strobing then hovered there at the tree line for about 30 minutes then it faded away. The other light however, stayed there hovering at the tree line for about another 30 minutes then it dissappeared. There are not houses around that area, as I ride my horses in the woods surrounding that area all of the time. I don't know what these crafts were as it was dark, very dark that night and I could not make out any shapes. I have never witnessed anything like this before in the six years that we have lived in this house. We have lived in this area for 10 years. I am going to go out to that area with my husband tomorrow November 25, we have a four wheeler, I am curious to see if there is any type of proof left behind.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Two bright lights - one danced wildly while the other stood still.;2002-02-02 20:30:00;20-25 min;Two bright lights - one danced wildly while the other stood still. I was at my home on a hilltop about 18 miles SE of Spokane, WA. At about 8:20 PM PDT I observed a bright light to the NW over Spokane.  This is not too unusual as this is the general direction of the local airport and military air base.  I am accustomed to seeing landing lights, and have observed them appear to hang in the air when the plane is taking off and traveling towards my location.  Usually however, I can detect the motion of the plane after several minutes.  What drew my attention to this light, was the fact that about 10 minutes after initially seeing it, it was still in the same location.  I then thought it must be a helicopter, and grabbed my 7X35 binoculars. What I saw through my binoculars was three white lights in a line, with red and blue lights on top.  The brightness would increase to quite bright, and then fade to dim, and back to bright etc. about every 2 to 3 minutes.  The light then began moving slowly toward the NE.  I then saw another light approaching from the SW.  I thought it must be an airplane coming to check out the original light.  But when the second light got to within what I estimate to be about 3 miles from the first light, it too then stopped and began to get brighter and dimmer, just like the first.  I called 911 and reported what I was seeing, and was told no one else had reported anything. Now what is still giving me goose bumps is that while I was on the phone with 911, I was still observing the lights in my binoculars.  All of a sudden the second light began dancing - it left the impression of what one sees on the 4th of July when you move a sparkler around rapidly at night.  What is most unusual is that the original light stayed stationary, so I know it just wasn't me getting jittery with the binoculars. This dancing lasted only about 20 seconds. The second dancing light then dimmed out and I didn't see it again. The original light then continued moving slowly to the NE, but as it got NNE of my location, the white lights went out, and the object began moving rapidly to the SSW, and it appeared to be climbing.  I would estimate its speed as that of a fast military jet.  I observed what appeared to be the normal red and green navigation lights on the outside edges, but there were two larger, brighter red lights which glowed steadily on top.  I was outside at this point, but I heard no noise, which is probably not so unusual, because the object was probably 20-30 miles from me at this time.  Its hard to estimate.  At about this time, I again saw what appeared to be an object much like the original, over Spokane, again in the general direction of the civilian and military airports.  This object again flucuated in intensity, but after about 5 minutes it dimmed out.  Again, what bothers me about this is the wildly dancing of the one light, while the other stayed stationary.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Moving lights over Spokane;2002-02-04 19:30:00;2.5 hours;Moving lights over Spokane This report supplements my original report submitted 2/02/02.  After submitting my report on 2/02, additional sightings of a more intensly lit object occured later in the evening.  These objects appeared over the western edge of the city of Spokane.  My vantage point is on a hill, aproximately 17 miles to the SE of Spokane. Last night, 02/04/02 the objects again appeared intermittently from about 7:30PM until about 11:00 PM.  Usually, only one object was present at a time, but once three objects were visible - two over western Spokane, and one to the north.  All were very bright, with the lights becoming very bright, then dimming etc., and each sighting lasting between 5 to 10 minutes.  The predominate color of the lights was a yellowish /orange,  but through my binoculars I could see flashing blue, red, and green.  The objects would generally just appear, and after several minutes of being stationary, begin drifting to the North.  At one point. a larger aircraft coming from the SE flew under one of the objects in sort of a zig-zag pattern, but then flew in a direction away from the civilian and military airfields.  At the time the three objects were visible, the two objects which were close together moved in sort of a semi-circle pattern and exchanged general locations.  At times the objects would move behind trees in my field of view, and then out again, so I know they are not stars or planets.  They must be an aircraft of some type, and I hope to hect they are ours. I telephoned a friend who lives in Spokane.  This person traveled a few blocks out to a point which has a clear view to the South, over downtown Spokane, and also to the West.  My friend later described 2 brief glimpses of what was described as  a huge horizontal box that looked like a flourescent light  stationary in the sky, in the approximate areas of the civilian and military airports.  My friend drove out to the airport area, but it was too foggy to see anything.  I asked if it could be a helicoptor, but my friend said that a local medical holicopter was operating in the downtown area, and that could be heard clearly, but there was no sound in the direction of the large flourescent light. I have been an aircraft enthusiast all my life, and I have never observed anything like these lights. There has been no mention of any of this in the local newspaper or television.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

I have seen this light many times over the last year and half. I have seen it clost to my house and at a bit of a distance. It is much brighter than the stars and it is obvious that is moves and hovers. I watched it last night for 1 & 1/2 hours then watched it fade away. On one occasion last October I saw a craft right over my house, travel very slowly to tree line, meet with another light, about 1/2 mile from my house and hover there for less than an hour. When it was over my house it was blinking red and white. When it is at a distance, last evening for example, it is a bright white light. I live south of Spokane, just west and north of Spangle. I live on 10 acres in the open and have always noticed this light to the west of me. Have you had any other reports of this type in this area?

It was first stationary, then moved very slowly south, traveling what I would estimate as 3 degrees.  After the first half of that distance the form dimmed to about half brightness, then suddenly disappeared.  We also saw one more identical object behaving simmilarly within the next 20 min.  It was moving very slowly, and did not appear to be dimming continuously as you would expect a meteorite to do, but more like a dimming of head lights.  It moved, stopped, moved in a straight line again, paralell to the horizon, and disappeared.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Bright star like lights in north day time sky, Spokane Wa.;2006-07-19 13:15:00;4-5 minutes;Bright star like lights in north day time sky, Spokane Wa. On Wednesday, July 19, 2006 I went out to wait for the mailman, my house faces north so I was observing the north sky while I waited, it was 1:15pm.  I noticed a bright star in the north about 45 degrees above my position just sitting and looking like the north star in the day time, unusual since it was bright and sunny with no clouds.  (about the same place you'd see the north star at night)  Then, coming from the east about two degrees above the first light, I witnessed another bright light coming towards it.  When light #2 was directly above the first one it stopped and now there were 2 star like lights above and below each other.  After several seconds the lower light started moving west and the upper one remained. It took a few minutes but light 2 eventually faded.  I believe the sun was reflecting off of what ever they were since the sun was directly behind in the south.  I have lived in Spokane all my life and have worked for the same company for 25 years.

Really birght white light spotted southwest of Spokane WA. 12/13/08, 6 p.m.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));2008-12-13 18:00:00;30 min.;Really birght white light spotted southwest of Spokane WA. 12/13/08, 6 p.m. My girlfriend and I seen a bight light in the sky, it was 6 pm here, night but it didn't look far enough away to be a star or planet. The light looked white, and was not moving. I watched it for about 5 minutes to make sure it was not moving. Then i went inside my house to get my girlfriend to come take a look at it also. It was very cold so we went back inside and I checked on it again about 15 minutes after I first seen it. It was still there but it was getting pretty cloudy and the light was getting dimmer, I am not sure if it was the clouds making it dimmer. But when i went to look if it was still there about 30 minutes after i first seen it, it was not there. But it was really cloudy by then, so i think maybe the clouds was hiding it. The reason i find this light to be so interesting is because this is not the first light I seen like this. Sorry my computer does not have Microsoft word any more. Around this time of year, last year I seen a light just like this one, only this one was close and i knew exactly where it was. I lived by a Mountain i use to run up all the time, it has those towers with red lights that blink at night. One night around 3 a.m. at night i went outside to have a smoke, and right above those towers there was a huge bight white light. I say its huge because it looked way closer then this last one I seen, but i did not think UFO at that time. But I knew that there is no reason a light like that should be there at that time of night. It took me about 10 minutes to finish my smoke, but i watched a little longer to see if it would move. By then I knew this was not normal and wanted to go grab my cell phone to get it on camera, so i could show my girlfriend and others. So I went inside my house to get it all the way down stairs, and went back out and it was still there. I was able to get it on video, I could of went on forever but i can only send 15 seconds of a clip to my girlfriend that lived in Minnesota at the time. I sent it to her, but the light was very smal! l on my cell phone cam and did not look like anything i was looking at. Now since I watch UFO Hunters I know these type of lights are while known, and would like to know what it is i am seeing. I wish I knew what I know now or i could of simply called 911 and drove over to that light and got really close to it. The one that i just now seen looked pretty far away and I did not want to drive in the ice we got out here. This one I don't really know what it could have been since it looked so far away, I am thinking maybe a planet may have been really close, but I don't know. The other light I seen was a UFO for sure. But I will keep watching maybe I will be lucky and see a light like my first one.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
fast moving star like object over spokane, washington 09/11/09;2009-09-11 22:00:00;15 seconds;fast moving star like object over spokane, washington 09/11/09 I also witnessed the event described by a helicopter pilot in Spokane, WA. on Sept 11th, 2009.  My 4 year old son and I went outside to play with his balsa wood airplanes when I noticed a star like object moving west to east directly over our heads.  It was very bright, brighter than any star in the sky and was moving at a rate faster than a jet, but too slow for a shooting star.  It had no blinking lights, just a bright single star like light.  No perimeter of the object was visible.  My angle of view was further west than the pilot that also witnessed it.  It appeared to slightly elevate in altitude before disappearing making me believe that it accelerated at a high rate of speed towards space giving it the appearance that it just went dim.  I was able to watch it for approximately 6 seconds... according to the other report it would have traveled approximately 30 miles during that period of time.  I would estimate that the object was flying under 3000 ft a! nd made absolutely no sound.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Dozens of lights in the sky over Spokane Wa. Seen of 4 different occasions;2011-08-17 22:00:00;1 hour;Dozens of lights in the sky over Spokane Wa. Seen of 4 different occasions On the 31st of July 2011, my boyfriend and I were outside around 10:30 at night. I saw what, at first, I thought was a shooting star. I pointed it out to him and we both watched it move across the sky and get dimmer and brighter.  It seemed to be at a pretty high altitude, but hard to say with no size reference to compare it to.  We continued to watch it for about 30-45 seconds until it completely faded away.  Thought it was kinda odd.  But then another one popped up in the sky, in a completely different spot. It didn't move in a straight pattern this time. It moved up and down left and right at a pretty steady pace. Not fast, not slow. Almost like a cruising like matter you'd see an airplane travel at. Mind you there were NO flashing lights. Just ONE solid light that was white, like a star. Hence why I thought at first it was a shooting star. We watched it until it faded away as well. THEN AGAIN, a third one pops up in a completely different spot and does the s! ame thing. Gets really bright and moves around until it fades away to nothing. We definitely thought it was strange but didn't have any explanation. The next night August 1st 2011, around 10:30 again, I was outside and out of the corner of my eye I caught a light flash in the sky. It was exactly like what we had seen the night before. I watched it travel across the sky until it faded completely. I stayed outside to watch a little longer but didn't see any other lights. THE NEXT NIGHT August 2nd 2011, again around 10:30, I was again, outside when THIS TIME I was looking to the sky to see if I'd catch a glimpse of the lights. And to my not so much surprise I seen another light!! By this point my mind is blown and I'm really wishing my boyfriend was out there to witness the lights with me again. I had told a couple people about it and every night I would watch the sky to see if there were any more lights. But there was nothing. Last night (mind you this was at 10:00pm last night August 17th 2011) my best friend and neighbor calls me and asks if I can hear the helicopter outside flying around. Apparently they were looking for someone because they had their spot light on looking in all the back yards. (This is the NW Blvd/Maple-Ash neighborhood) When I came out I looked up and seen what I thought was the helicopter. I say to my friend that I don't see its spotlight. She then directs me to the south where the helicopter was when all along I was looking at the bright light flying around in the northern sky. I am then VERY excited and tell her to come look at the bright light, explaining to her that its just like what I had seen earlier in the month. We watched it fly around until it faded away completely. We sat outside and started talking about how strange the light was when ANOTHER one pops up out of nowhere in the northeastern sky.  Our older kids (10 and 12yrs) come outside wondering why we've bee! n gone so long.  So we start explaining to them whats up. When YET AGAIN another light pops up in the sky. My best friend goes inside to get her camera so we can try and capture some of this. Me and the boys see yet another one moving from west to east, the light got REALLY bright, stopped, then descended to what looks like, from our position, to be about the felts field/valley area. Hard to say from our viewpoint exactly. Anyways, while it descended, it started pulsating red and orange. We watched it until it slowly drop out of the sky until it was out of our view. By this point we're really tripping out! (We never heard any booms though, always silent) We sat out there and continued to watch the lights in the sky until about 11:00. There were too many to count. Had to be DOZENS of different lights. Some individual and some in groups. Some travel in the exact same flight pattern as the one before it, some are completely random. Some blink on and off. Some are just really ! dim like the light you'd see when a satellite moves across the! sky, an d some are extremely bright!  To me they're UFO's... now that does NOT mean its aliens but it sure as hell DOES mean they're unidentified!!! The best way I can describe them is, they look like stars at first, then they get REALLY BRIGHT, and travel across the sky in no particular pattern and fade away until you can't see them with your naked eye anymore. They do NOT fly in straight lines every time either. Some do, but others move from left to right then up and down then back to the left again. Very strange. Going out tonight to try and catch this on video.! Really hoping for clear skies tonight!!  There were many reports and A LOT of talk on our local news stations facebook pages last night, 8/17/2011 and today, 8/18/2011, about a bright light seen over the Spokane Valley that fell from the sky and a HUGE BOOM that shook people out of their homes to the streets to investigate. The light that we seen descending from the sky, pulsating orange and red is approximately the same time as the reports from the Valley. Coincidence? There is currently no explanation to what these witnesses in the valley experienced.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
3 bright orange lights at low altitude over northwest Spokane.;2011-08-27 21:12:00;1 minute;3 bright orange lights at low altitude over northwest Spokane. While walking to my brothers house, I was north on 2400 n. Belt walking past a man walking his dogs.  At at about 30 degrees to my left (slightly northwest of my position, I observed three orange lights all equal in size fairly large, about one quarter the size of a full moon.  They looked like flares but did not move for about 20 seconds. I called my brother and told him to go outside to see them and by then one went north/northwest, one went west, and one went east.   My brother was able to momentarily see the one traveling east but seemed to go up and disappear quickly.  It was around 9:11pm to 9:12pm and were probably between 200 to 400 feet up above the area of Audubon Park when first seen.   No noise was heard, my brother observed the eastbound one straight over his house before it went up and disappeared. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS, SUBMITTED ON SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 04, 2018.))

While there we were looking around into the sky and the neighborhood.  Then my wife ((name deleted)), happened to look toward the southeast and notice all these lights popping out.  There had to be about a dozen or so when she said look at all those lights. They appeared to be a bright fiery read in color and changing to an almost orange color.  I would guest they were not as far away as the stars.  We got as quiet as possible to notice if there was any sounds.  We noticed none. Then, the further they went to the northwest they would stop and move back and forth toward one another, like they were playing, then stopping and going.  They seem to be in some random formation.  Suddenly the first several would disappear to the south of where I reside, then more would appear from the southeast. This display lasted from about 7:15 pm until about 7:25 pm. I then called three media stations, KREM-2 KXLY-4 and KHQ-6 and none of them seem to be interested in my conversation, at all.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

I looked up in the sky at about 45 degrees towards the southeast and saw 12 orangish flickering lights moving through the sky towards the south.  At first I thought it looked like Santa’s sleigh and reindeers light up.  As the lights curved and moved upwards  towards the south I noticed that they disappeared one by one as they were directly over our garage which is south of the house. 	I went inside and yelled for everyone to hurry up and get outside and look at the sky.  My husband, Sam Powell, and my neighbor who was over visiting, Zebbie Wassom, came outside.  I counted 10 lights in the sky.  We all watched for a few minutes.  There was no noise.  I saw new lights emerge from the distant southeast at about 30 degrees in the sky.  They appeared more of a flaming red color.  The lights followed an arcing pattern through the sky. (Appearing in the southeast, moving northwest, moving west, moving southwest, then moving south and disappearing.  All this activity occurred in the southern part of the sky.) Some lights were further apart from each other.  Some lights were higher than others but not by more than about 5 degrees.  Some lights appeared to change speed slightly.  Some lights appeared to change direction slightly.  As the lights got closer they all appeared more of an orange color. 	We all went back inside.  My husband got out the phone book.  Zebbie and I grabbed our cell phones and went back outside. It was 7:20 pm according to my cell phone as Zebbie called her husband who was at home across the street and told him to look out the window towards the south in the sky. 	Zebbie went back inside shortly thereafter.  I continued watching until the last light was gone at 7:24 pm. Overall, I counted about 15 lights in the sky at one time and about 24 lights total.   The lights were high up in the sky – not to be confused with airplanes coming in for approach to Spokane International Airport or Fairchild Air Force Base.  The lights appeared larger when they emerged from the distant southeast sky. When they were closer they were about the size of a regular star in the sky except they were bright and flickered.  The lights did not come down from the sky instead the moved across: in, around, and then out. The lights did not have a tail on them like a comet. I didn’t bother to try and record this event on my cell phone because I thought the clarity would be bad and besides it would be on the news with an explanation of what had happened. The rest of the evening and for a few days I watched  local TV news stations to see if anyone else saw it, but nothing was reported that day or since.

I witnessed unexplainable bright light with very strange movement in Spokane.;2014-05-30 00:30:00;3 minutes;I witnessed unexplainable bright light with very strange movement in Spokane. I witnessed unexplainable bright light movement in sky tonight.  I live out in the country in South Spokane, and I went out past my yard and house to edge of woods to hear the owls.   I looked up at what I thought may be very bright plane or maybe satellite but the movement was like NOTHING I have ever seen before.  This light was almost falling slowly in the north eastern part of the sky.  Almost a 60-70• angle above horizon.   It would fall or orbit downward in a feather like trajectory, swaying from left to right slowly and then stopping perfectly still with no blinking lights or sound of any kind.  Then it would start up again never really following a pattern but seemingly heading downward toward the horizon.  Then it just disappeared.   I have been a lifelong satellite watcher and can say it was a bit bigger or at least brighter but not much.  It had absolutely no flashing lights and when planes or helicopters are that close there is sound.   Not sure what to think.  Does ISS behave this way?;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Bright light in front of cloud east of Spokane;2015-06-09 07:45:00;10 seconds;Bright light in front of cloud east of Spokane Hi, My husband and I enjoy listening to Peter on Coast to Coast, but I never figured I would be sending in a report. I actually live in Spokane, north of Fairchild, down in the canyon… so not too far from Peter.   Yesterday, Tuesday, June 9th, I was heading into work eastbound on Hwy 2 towards I-90.  I was watching the geo engineering in the eastern sky, as there were three planes that I could see at the time that were spraying.   At about 7:45 just before I got to the I-90 ramp I saw something bright and round in front of a cloud, north of the three planes.  Honestly I have never seen anything like this before.  It was much larger than a star and much brighter than one.  It was round and just incredibly bright.   It did not move at all, just pulsated bright.  I watched it for about 10 seconds, then it disappeared into the cloud behind it.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

I suddenly saw a reddish orange light moving over downtown Spokane from what looked like the east.   It seemed too fast for a regular plane and as soon as I pointed it out, it curved hard towards south south-west, directly away from my pointing finger, and kind of corkscrewed, until we couldn't see it anymore.   About 5-7 minutes later, a plane appeared, taking almost the same path as the light, but much slower. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I have never reported any type of ufo before so this will be my first time.  I live in the city of Spokane by the college campus of Gonzaga.  I stepped out onto my front porch as I do often on a clear night and look up at the stars.  Instantly I noticed a very bright star to the south that at first seemed stationary but then started moving across the sky due north.  It looked like a very bright star much bigger then any satellite but had no lights that a aircraft would possess.   It traveled for maybe 5 seconds before stopping I expected at this point to be able to recognize the object but at that point it took off directly straight up shrinking in size and then disappearing.  I don't know what else to say except this was no satellite no aircraft or a illusion the object traveled far enough and definitely went straight up to rule out a illusion.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

It had no noise, usually when planes are seen at that distance you can hear them.  Then a second light came out from the same NW place on the horizon (right of Division on the north side for Spokane people).  They were both following the same flight pattern and extremely close, heading diagonally to about a 45 degree angle then just disappearing.  They originated from the same spot and vanished from the same spot.  I continued to watch five more come out at the same spot and vanishing at the same spot during 5 minutes.   Then my fiancé came out and saw two more do the same thing.

I witnessed between 3 and 6 lights that moved consistantly accross the sky as if they were Satellites.  These lights would appear moments after visually seeing what appeared to be a shooting star which each appeared to me to be leaving the orbit as opposed to entering it.  When following each of these lights from one side to the other, there would then be a shooting star at a 45 degree angle outward that would happen.  This same thing happened 3 clear times.  There were other high flying US planes to compare speed, trajectory etc. as well.  Locater in the PNW, I was facing westerly centering myself with a bright star I later determined to be Zenith.  The more complex part is that while trying to telepathically communicate with this star, when showing emotion the object were responding to my feeble attemps at communication.  I dont drink or use drugs.  I was sober.  I absolutely believe we all should be looking up.  Not just for a moment or two.  But spend and hour go sit under the stars.  Let your eyes adjust. You CAN communicate with it all if you let it happen.  This is also the first of any such article I have ever written on this or any similar subject.  I believed enough to find this page and offer my contribution.  I now believe.  I will be back out tonight and each night!
