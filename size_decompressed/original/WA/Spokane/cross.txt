Object was very high in the sky and looked like 50 satellites combined into one large UFO.  This object was by far the largest I have seen in my life.  I am 50 years old. It was moving very fast and completely silent.  It wasn't skipping across our atmosphere and it didn't appear to be burning.  This UFO never changed in color.  The color was a bright soft white color.  There was no colored lights blinking indicating that it was an aircraft.  After about 45 seconds it vanished from full brightness to nothing.  My 18 year old son was with me.  I will never forget what I saw last night.  I tried to video with my phone and couldn't zoom in to get a good video.  I did try and saved what I have.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
