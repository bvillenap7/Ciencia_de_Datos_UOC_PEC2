rotating metallic chrome object  shining-intense ruby light , diamond/flat cone shape, stationary high altitude;1996-12-16 14:25:00;6min;rotating metallic chrome object  shining-intense ruby light , diamond/flat cone shape, stationary high altitude one rotating metallic (silver/chrome) inverted diamond/flat cone shape, rotating approx once/2sec with a strange ruby light emitting from lower third/bottom of object. The object was stationary and at an altitude of 8000+ meters as cirrus clouds slightly obscured object as clouds moved. The object was about 10 to 15 lunar diameters due east or west (I can't remember).  The odd ruby colored light I assume was fixed on the object as entire object rotated.  I estimate the size of the object would be about a small house to a bus, but diamond/conical in shape.  10 to 15 lunar diameters away from the moon's position.

Steel fish-looking ufo swimming through our atmosphere;2008-08-05 20:45:00;15-20 seconds;Steel fish-looking ufo swimming through our atmosphere I stepped outside and looked northeast.  The sky was clear. I saw a gray, diamond shape enter my view over the constellation Lacerta.  It hung in the air completely still for a few seconds(about three seconds).  Then it made two counter-clockwise loop da loops.  At the top of the second loop it hung still again for a few more seconds(about five seconds).  Next it dipped left into a clockwise loop. At the top of this loop it doubled in speed and rose up and to the left toward the constellation Hercules until it was out of view.  The ufo looked like a gray matte diamond.  I saw no lights, heat, or exhaust.  Its movements were smooth and playful like a fish in water.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Dancing blue light in the sky;2012-02-04 00:27:00;20 min;danceing blue light in the sky When i went out side from my house to go to a friends house. I saw a bright blue object faceing south of northen spokane. as i watched it it moved up and down and sideways.  It did this for about 5min then it just stoped moveing around.   I noteced that when i used my flash light and turned it on and i would flash the light at it it would move.  When i got to my friends house the object must have followed me there because it moved from the south west to south east.  I have been seeing this object for the past two weeks what it is i dont know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
