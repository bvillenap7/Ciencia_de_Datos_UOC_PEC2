Confirmation of 1974 report 34 years later.;1974-08-09 12:00:00;10-15 seconds;Confirmation of 1974 report 34 years later. I just wanted to confirm this siting I found in your data base. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37346.html   It was a clear sunny afternoon and I was at Fairchild AFB.  As I was rounding the corner of the supply building I noticed a cigar shaped craft with a flame about twice as long as the craft. It was approximately 10 miles to the south and traveling north-northwest at about the same speed as an airliner, which I thought it was except for the single flame from the back, and the were no discernible wings or tail.  As I watched it, the flame shortend up, the craft turned abruptly due east and shot off at an incredible speed. I was 20 at the time and there were no dugs or alcohol involved.

((HOAX??))  Two white cigar-shaped craft close together.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-06 12:00:00;5 minutes;Two white cigar-shaped craft close together At 12 noon I saw two white cigar shaped craft very close together high in the sky.  One flew just ahead of the other, and they were close, about the width of a wing had they been airplanes.  They flew west to east across the sky and flashed briefly in the Sun, but I still saw no wings or contrails.   40 minutes later I saw two similar craft fly back east to west in the same configuration.  One emitted a thick white contrail and the other did not.  They may well have all been airplanes.  Now it is 14:24 and there are two contrails twisted like a double helix across the sky ESE to WNW.  That's probably just a wind pattern.  I don't really think these are extraterrestrial craft, but I'd love some answers. ((NUFORC Note:  We can't provide answers, if the witness doesn't provide contact information.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.  Hoax??

Silver cigar-shaped object very slowly moving over Spokane in SW direction.;2019-07-18 17:30:00;20 seconds;Silver cigar-shaped object very slowly moving over Spokane in SW direction. I was sitting in a chair in my backyard at approximately 17:30.  I looked overhead in a southerly direction and I saw a cigar-shaped object.  This object was moving slowly, if at all, in a southwest direction.  It was silver and the late afternoon sun was reflecting brightly on it.  This object had no wings or rotors and there was no sound coming from it.  I observed it for about 20 seconds.  I got up and ran into my house to grab my binoculars.  By the time I came back out (25 seconds later-I timed myself later) it was gone.  No sound â€“ nothing.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
