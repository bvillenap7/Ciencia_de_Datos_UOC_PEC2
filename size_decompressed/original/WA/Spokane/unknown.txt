It was a radio announcer.;1974-06-14 19:00:00;30 minutes;It was a radio announcer. Hello!  Back in 1974, my husband and I were driving along in Idaho, heading to Washington, and we kept hearing the guy on our favorite rock and roll station say things like, “Ya can't keep a secret in the ol deep freeze,” and this went on for 30 minutes between songs. So, when the news came on the jockey  said “a ufo had crashed in Indiana and four humanoid bodies were aboard and were deceased.  WELL!!!  Not another word about it, and lots of people I spoke to heard the radio announcement and were really curious. That is all I have to say, other than I have contacted the angel, Raphael, many times in meditation to go help others and he was always a blue color….I never understood that till recently and I cried finally knowing…I am not religious or organized in any way.  I have dreams, at least that is what I call them, which are very revealing but that's a long story. I mainly wanted to say something about that 1974 news that never reached many people, LOL. Thank you for being here.  8);47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Twin lights fly overhead;1994-11-27 20:00:00;5-10 minutes;Twin lights fly overhead Two unidentafiable objects were seen circling the area of University and Broadway. They moved quickly for the altitude of which they flew, circling the area about 4 or 5 times. Then one of the objects flew away, followed by the other after it passed over one last time.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Unusual light outside my bedroom window.;2001-08-08 12:22:00;28 minutes;Unusual light outside my bedroom window. I was going to bed and decided to raise my blinds and open the window for some fresh air. As I laid my head on my pillow, I noticed a light in the sky. I thought it was a bright star at first but as I kept looking I knew it wasn't a star.  So, I thought it must be an airplane. I then saw a red and green flashing light. I thought it was surely an airplane but it was not moving. It just stayed in the spot it was in when I first noticed it. I continued to lay in bed and look at the light, why, I don't know.  Suddenly it looked as if it were falling very fast and then stop instantly.  It did not fall a very long time but it was fast and then an abrupt stop. I felt a little funny inside when I saw that and got out of bed to look out my window closer.(It was 12:22 a.m. at this point) As I strained to look out my screen, the light seemed to by spinning and I could see flashing or spinning red, green, and gold/yellow lights. I looked aroud the clear sky and compared what I was looking at to the other stars in the sky. They did not look similar. The stars were plain and not moving and this light I was watching had color and movement. I just continued to watch because I wanted to see it move again.  It did move again and this time it was in an S movement up and then down again. Not too high or low just small movements within a certain area (I was looking between two tall trees and could see it the whole time)The movement is what kept me watching, it reminded me of playing video games and how fast and over exagerated we can move objects with the controllers. Then it  began moving toward the trees very slowly and sometimes with a little dip or two. I watched it until it disappeared behind the trees. It was 12:50 a.m.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Very small spere lights clustered far up in the sky with one lower.;2001-09-09 16:40:00;20 minutes;Very small spere lights clustered far up in the sky with one lower. On a cloudless day I looked up to actually look for these things because this is not the first instance. I did not expect anything but this time there was a cluster of 5. I was riding a bicycle and when I got to my brothers house at approx.4:35, I made them look. We counted 7 small circular lights far up in the sky. I don't know if they had lights or were reflecting light. I watched one move in front of or behind and appear on the other side of another. They were moving in diferent patterns. Once all in a straight line. All moving north. One of these objects was much lower than the others. I thought it must be something else but my brother had binoculars. This one looked like an E and it was a spectrum on it or green and yellow lights. We watched this for about 15 minutes before they disappeared. The other events happened in the daylight also and on clear days around 5:00. The 1st event I saw 3, two stationary and 1 moving south(my neibor saw this one). The second event 08/18/01 at 4:30, I was downtown with my husband(who doesn't believe this), I was trying to explain about the ufo and I said to him Just imagine something so small like a ball of a ballpoint pen up in the sky. Then I saw 1. He could not see it. There may have been more but this one was between trees. I did not think I would ever see these again after the first time but I have... twice.  Just look up on a clear sky.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Friggen freaky;2002-03-21 22:30:00;5 minutes;Friggen freaky Was with my wife outside spokane on the Newport highway.  As we were driving home 2 distinct flying objects crossed the highway at a very low altitide.  The radiant light from each object was such that a definite shape could not be made out.  I estimate the altitude from the bottom of the light source to the ground was no more that 500 feet.  The criss crossed the road 3 times before shooting straight up and out of site.  Aprox 1 min later they returned flying straing along the road behind us, over flying my vehicle with NO sound and once agin criss crossing the road several times before leaving the area.  I do not know honestly if they were terrestial objects or what.  The hue from the light was constant, a very bright light blue. ((ADDENDUM)) Dear ((named deleted))  Thank you very much for the excellent report!  I do not know what it was you saw, but it does not sound to be normal for this planet.  Have you contacted any radio stations, newspapers, or law enforcement offices to inquire whether anyone else might have reported the objects?  I suspect that there may have been other witnesses, who simply have not come forward,  Thank you, again, for having shared the information with our Center!

Multiple, unilluminated high-speed craft flying over Spokane in early morning of 9/20/02.;2002-09-20 04:51:00;5 seconds;Multiple, unilluminated high-speed craft flying over Spokane in early morning of 9/20/02. At 4:51 A.M. (PST), I was looking at a cluster of stars just ahead of the constellation of Orion.  There is a group of 6-8 stars that are clustered very close together and I was trying to see how many I could count.  I was facing south (though I was looking straight up) and the full moon was low in the horizon in the southwest. Suddenly, going from North to South came three objects streaking across the sky.  There were no lights, though the objects were whitish-grey in color.  They were not illuminated.  They were definitely not birds.  Birds flap their wings and cannot completely go across the sky from horizon to horizon in 5 seconds.  These things were moving at supersonic speed, faster than any fighter ever flown on this planet and were slower than shooting stars, somewhere between shooting star and supersonic fighter (speed-wise).  Suddenly, the middle object shot left, then right again, splitting the other two.  No craft on earth can make that turn at those G-forces.  All three objects were gone within 5 seconds.  It was the damndest thing I've ever seen.  These were not lights, nor even lighted craft these were craft that were illuminated only by moonlight.  They were solid yet there was no trail left and no sound.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

I felt like I couldn' breath. It than felt like I passed out. I awoke to the words, he has (unintelliagble) send him back I felt like I had a IV in my arm. the next thing I knew I was back in my bedroom. I have pondered long and hard about even telling this to anyone as it sounds crazy. But I know it happened and wasn't a dream because I woke up the first time to the shaddow overwhelming me, then I woke up with again in my bed about 5AM. I have not slept with the lights off since this happened.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

White dot over Spokane WA moving in extreme angles instantly;2007-07-16 22:30:00;30-45 seconds;White dot over Spokane WA moving in extreme angles instantly About 10:30-11:00 P.M. in the northwest sky from Spokane WA. I saw a small white dot moving extremely fast. It then slowed almost to a stop then started moving in extreme angles to points in the area it was in. It stopped at each point for a fraction of a second before instantly changing directions and going to another. The speed at which it was moving between points was almost instantaneously. It did this for about 20 seconds staying in the same relative area. Then it started making curving and dipping motions for about 15 seconds before making a 180 degree curve and disappeared. I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Either space junk or a meteor, very close to my position. ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor at 05:28 hrs..  PD));2008-02-19 05:30:00;5 seconds;Either space junk or a meteor, very close to my position. I was driving due south on ash street at cross street indiana.  I viewed a brighly lit object streaking across the sky in a large arc. An estimated 12:00 to 9:00 arc at about 15-30 degrees above the horizon, and an estimated southwesterly direction from my vantage point, and heading south (parallel to my direction of travel). The objects tail was pastel green in color. It looked to seperate or breakup at the end of it's travel (like an explosion). In a very bright light as magnesium or titanium would look when it burns. Sort of like fireworks would look if you fired it horizontally. That's what I thought it was. Either that or an electric transformer. It looked very, very close.

Triangle shaped 3 lights with one big red light on bottom of craft.;2008-10-08 22:00:00;15 seconds;Triangle shaped 3 lights with one big red light on bottom of craft. It was up pretty high but I could clearly see 3 lights. one big red near the front or in the middle with 2 smaller white lighs behind and away from craft. So i belive it was triangular. At first i thought it was a airplane untill I noticed it was not moving or flasing. I was driving west bound now with the red light I assume that is the front then that would say it is facing north east. at that angle I would not mistake it for a slow moving airplane at an angle that looks like it is staying still. after about 10 seconds it started moving about 60 mph then I lost track of it. But I know what i seen. even if it was an airplane appering to move so slowly that there is no movement to all the sudden be moving at a steddy pace. Id say it was at an 50 degree angle from me and i could tell that the red light was  on the bottom not the front and there was no green light or any other light near the red one no light were flashing. I do spent sum time looking up at the sky this is only my second experiance seeing some craft I know was not made by man.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

It hovered perfectly still for about 2 min and then slowly moved behind some trees and vanished.  It had about 10 small red light on top that I could see.  It did not make any noise that I could hear so it couldn't have been a helicopter. None of the lights on it were blinking and I couldn't make out the shape of it.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
seen an alien;2012-04-16 04:00:00;20 min;seen an alien I was returning home about 4 am when just off to the left of my drive way some thing stood up in the field and looked at me and when it seen me stop and get out and look in its direction  it than ran or squirmed across the street in to the trees at first I thought a deer but it was up right and running in a weird way like an octopus I think I seen it dragging one tentacle  it than went from tree to tree like it was circling me so I walk very quickly in the house making sure not to take my eyes off of it and when it was going from tree to tree it would stop at that tree and peek at me from one side or the other than move to the next tree and do the same thing at each tree so when I went in the house I grabbed a flash light to see if it was a person mind you I live in the country so I don’t really think someone was sleeping in my field and dragged there sleeping bag across the street another thing that helps me know it was not human when I shined my flash light on it its eye shined green not red like a humans would. After I saw the eye color I went back in the house waiting for it to try to get in or peek in my windows so I laid on my couch looking and waiting and listening for and nothing happened  so I just tried to go to sleep and just get over it buy this time I was in denial and thought ok it was a deer. The next morning I thought about what I saw and walked out to the field where I saw it there was nothing but I remembered what it looked like and it was up right a light shade of blue witch could have been from the moon light it was really skinny and tall  with a tear drop shaped head that kind of  just formed in to the body no shoulders and long arms that looked like tentacles. But that’s all I remember and know I can say it was flat out the most scariest moment I have ever been through I have seen ghosts and ufo’s but nothing like that and it still scares me just thinking about it and its been almost a month another thing! just a week or two before my event there was reports of stra! nge ligh ts over one of my city’s neighbor hoods that was on the news the next day or day after but I didn’t think twice about this because I was in denial about what I saw until  like two weeks after it all happened than I started realizing that it could be possible that I actually saw an alien putting the two events together;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Spokane, WA, lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a planet or twinkling star??  PD));2019-01-30 19:00:00;continuous;Spokane, WA, lights. HI, I am originally from Spokane.  Here is my question.  When I am in Post Falls at night I look toward Spokane at a 45 degree up angle and I can see a light that flashes green then red then white in a repeating pattern.  As I drive into Spokane Valley, the light disappears although I can still see surrounding stars.  If I continue on up Sunset Hill and get out by Spokane international airport and look back east to Spokane, I can see the blinking lights again at a 45 degree angle to the east.  The lights are stationary.  Other people have seen lights like this.  Here is a youtube video that looks like what I see. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdNSUIua7l8  I have seen these lights over different towns that I have visited.  You could go and look for yourself at the Spokane light.  It is located above the tower mountain area just south of the city. I have no idea what it is.  I just found it weird that I could triangulate its location.  That makes me consider that it is not at a very high altitude.

Thick blue beam of light coming from the sky.;2019-07-23 21:25:00;20 seconds;Thick blue beam of light coming from the sky. I was watching the lighting storm from my living room window on the south hill in Spokane on 53rd street, while my girlfriend was in the bathroom.  There was a large volume of lightning.   All of a sudden I saw a blue beam of light shoot down from the sky at a 45 degree angle, and it was thick.  It was about a 7 foot wide beam of light and I was approximately 1000 feet relative to the event.  There's no way I could be the only person who saw this.   It didn't look like any light any person could have possibly owned.  This thing shot way up into the clouds and was intense.  It remained a solid beam of light for approximately 20 seconds and then disappeared.  This was absolutely not lightning by any chance whatsoever.  I know what lightning looks like.  This was CLEAR.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
