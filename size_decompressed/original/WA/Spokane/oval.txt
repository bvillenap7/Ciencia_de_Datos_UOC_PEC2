white oval craft travelled east to west over Spokane,estimate 10,000 ft,speed aprox 200mph,seemed to be dark line around edge.;1998-07-15 15:00:00;30 sec;white oval craft travelled east to west over Spokane,estimate 10,000 ft,speed aprox 200mph,seemed to be dark line around edge. Standing on a loading dock at work looking east, two of us were talking about UFO`s, and noting neither of us had ever seen one. Just then I said what`s that? and we looked up in a clear blue sky and saw a white oval craft cruising over town, travelling slowly east to west. It looked about a quarter the size of the full moon. We noted it had no wings or discernible features other than a thin dark line around the edge. It made no sound,and left no contrail. We noted it kept going straight in the direction of the long axis of the oval, and made no turns. Guessing, we estimated 10,000 ft. high, speed 200mph. I`m an ameteur astronomer, and was surprised to see this in broad daylight.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Reflective silver craft viewed in Spokane Washington;2006-07-20 10:32:00;approx 10-15 sec.;Reflective silver craft viewed in Spokane Washington Im a 26 year old male studying pursuing a profession and attending college.  I realize that college students have been the subject of submiting hoaxes, however I do believe that this report is not a hoax although determining such is left to subjective review by this site.  At about 10:32 am at Riverfront Park a large oval shaped craft was spotted flying very slowly while I was relaxing under a shaded tree in a large grass field area of the Park.  It had a high glossy silver color, and reflected the sun rays exposing the highly reflective metal.  It was as large and oval like a blimp and just after about 13 seconds, it completely vanished, leaving a short chem-trail just before it disappeared.  The day this occured, the sky was completely void of clouds and the object did not decrease in size before vanishing like airplanes do, it was simply there one second, then gone the next.  I searched the sky for it after it left but couldn't find it.  Im convinced from this experience and others, that they are here, and they do exist..;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
The four (5)of us watched as two glowing objects flew slowly in the sky from the east.  They were flying one directly behind the other;2010-10-20 19:00:00;120 seconds;The four (5)of us watched as two glowing objects flew slowly in the sky from the east.  They were flying one directly behind the other and appeared to be pulsating a firey reddish/orange color.  Regarding size: If you held out a dime away from you they would be that size.  Distance: About as high as an aircraft approaching a landing.  Speed: each object maintained it's distance from one another until the object in the front took off at an incredibly high rate of speed at about a 70 degree angle away from us until the light disappeared (about 3-5 seconds).  Just about the time the fist object disappeared, the second object stopped and appeared to simply hover (much like a helicopter).  Then, it too, lifted straight up to the sky and took off at an incredibly high rate of speed and within 3-5 seconds, was gone from sight.  There were no sounds that accompanied either object.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
the object resembled a blimp, flat/concaved on the underside with 3 lights.;2010-11-18 20:20:00;2 minutes;the object resembled a blimp, flat/concaved on the underside with 3 lights. I am a 22 year old male recently back from Alaska for seasonal work.  On the night of November 18th, 2010 at approximately 8:20 P.M, 2 good friends and myself  saw something  about  100 feet away (behind an unoccupied house)and 150-200 feet above the ground hovering.  I was driving home from the store about 1 block south of my home in Millwood.  I did not notice the object first of us three, my eyes were on the road.  I noticed my friend in the passenger seat was looking at something very intently.  He was gazing through the driver side window and practically leaned over me to stare at it, when my friend in the rear driver side seat blurted out “dude what ((deleted)) is that in the sky?”  My first reaction was to instinctively look at the object, but at first only glimpsed it for a brief moment before returning my eyes to the road. At first glance I certainly thought that someone in the area had inflated an advertisement blimp with lighting and let it float over their house attached to the ground via cable. After taking my eyes off of the object my observations had become clear to me, I had indeed seen something floating above the ground, unnaturally. I drove on about 50 feet and made a left hand turn onto my road and stopped after about another 20 feet to better observe the object as it was stationary when first sighted, and still on the left above the ground.  As soon as I stopped to observe it however, the object slowly turned 180 degrees and began moving in the direction that I had just came from slowly. I realized that the object had begun to move and shifted my car in reverse to pursuit. I reversed very quickly around the corner and started to chase the object with my car. As soon as I rounded the corner, however, the object was gone from sight passing behind trees in the neighborhood, and I sped ! down the street to see it again and reached 60 mph before I got the last glimpse of it (I was the only one to see it that last time) speeding across the road in a southwestern direction. I returned home and reviewed my observations with my friends. What I saw was almost blimp shaped- metallic grayish in color- with what appeared to be 3 street lights (or lights with similar color) on its underside.  Rounded like a blimp on the top of it and concaved on the underside.  There was no sound observed by us.  Although we had the music volume turned up, it was reasoned by us 3 that if it were a helicopter or anything man-made than we should have heard it, especially in considering that the object was very close to us.  When the object began to move I noticed that the lights on the bottom side got significantly bright for a brief moment than begun rotating around the object, and at my last glimpse of it I only saw a circular ring of light speeding across the road.

High flying, fast, large white object Eastern Washington;2014-06-16 11:30:00;4 seconds;High flying, fast, large white object Eastern Washington I was waiting at the Hastings Park and Ride bus Terminal in North Spokane.  I was waiting for the 11:55 am bus headed north to my home in Deer Park.  I estimate the time to be about 11:30 am.   I was facing north and I happen to look up at the sky to see a very large, white object heading east to west at height and with speed.  What surprised me was the speed it seemed to travel and the size it was.  Normally, when one sees a plane at that height the plane is small, hard to see, and moving at a speed that appears slow to our relative perspective.   This white colored object, however, was 3 to 4 time larger that a plane would be at that height and is travel through a large cloud break at a very fast pace.  Much faster than any convention planes I’ve ever seen.   Oddly enough it also left no condensation trail of any kind.   I would normally discount this as the sun reflecting off an airplane but I can still not account for the size of this thing, the lack of any type of condensation trail, and the speed it was moving at.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
UFO oval shape emitted immensely bright lights for one minute.;2017-07-27 23:00:00;1 minute;UFO oval shape emitted immensely bright lights for one minute. Saw it pull up with bright lights, floating semi close to the ground, but I was in the valley below looking upwards at the top of the tree covered hill.  It was barely above the trees.  It made a stationary stop and started to emit a very very bright light that illuminated for around a minute.  It had no flashing red lights like planes usually do, so intrigued I began to take a look. It pulls up with large white lights above the trees and stops, it then starts the lights.  I was scared because it was moving quite slow in comparison to that of a normal plane.  These lights lasted roughly one minute average.  I even recorded it on my phone in person I was staring at the blinding light.  In my recording, I was able to capture the image and even notice what seemed to be a second spacecraft blinking in a non-rhythmic pattern.

But the light it emitted during that minute was the brightest I had ever seen.  Never seen anything that can stay stationary until last night.  After the lights it headed towards W Washington.  It did this light thing at the top of the hill over some trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
