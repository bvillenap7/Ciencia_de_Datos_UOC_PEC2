Multiple lights on sequencial nights;1999-07-26 22:00:00;multiple times;Multiple lights on sequencial nights On july 26th of this year,Iwas standing on my deck facing west and I noticed a light about 45 degrees above the horizon,roughly as bright as an aircraft beacon at 5 miles,orange in color,traveling faster than an aircraft but slower than a meteor but with no visible tail and in a straight line following a south to north trajectory.At arms length the light appeared to travel roughly 24and simply 'blinked out'I stayed on the deck for 2hours more without seeing anything I would consider anomalous,(a satellite and a few meteors)However the light I had seen piqued My interest ENOUGH to send Me out on the deck every night since the 26th of July.I have been witness to a cornicopia of  different lights I have never really seen before in My star gazing.There was a white light that showed characteristics of the orange light except for direction of travel and that the light flashed before it went out,and again,no visable trail,and the pulsed lights that would flash quite brightly in stationary, single and double flashes.these are bright flashes,and could not be mistaken with Venereal shimmering.I've sighted 9 of these lights in in 7 days;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Quick flash lit up WHOLE sky for split second like nuclear explosion at 2:42am.  ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor.  PD));2004-06-03 02:42:00;1 second;Quick flash lit up WHOLE sky for split second like nuclear explosion at 2:42am. I had just pulled up in front of my house after I got off work and I had  just turned off my headlights, and I saw a quick flash light up the WHOLE sky, like a nuclear explosion.  I expected to hear a boom because it seemed so close, maybe 15 miles away.  But I never heard anything and it wasn't lightning because there wasn't a cloud in the sky.  It was very quick, too quick to describe except everything lit up for a split second. ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor.  PD));47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

I know because the radio towers on the mountain it was over are at 2000 ft.   Also, I   very awkward that I go out and look and there's a craft strobe light back at me.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Two small, intense, blinking lights circled above Spokane Valley, WA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));2013-10-20 18:57:00;30 seconds;Two small, intense, blinking lights circled above Spokane Valley, WA. Peter Davenport: I just saw the strangest of the three or four UFOs I have seen.  At about 6:57 PDT, I saw two blinking lights zooming around.  It started with one very small and bright, blue-white light heading east, which appeared to be a satellite. I was about fifteen miles north of Spokane, WA and looking to the south.  A second one appeared slightly to the east of the first and heading west, toward the other one.  They were blinking randomly about one second each two to four seconds.  At this time I thought I was watching something taking place a thousand feet above I-90, in Spokane Valley.  They might have been a few miles north of Mica Peak. As the two small, intense, blinking lights interacted for thirty seconds or so, they changed speed and direction.  Because the lights were off more than they were on, it was hard to tell which one was which as they cirlcled.  Sometimes they may have been moving at about the speed of airplanes and sometimes much faster than any airplane.  I blinked my eyes and asked myself if I was really seeing it in the physical realm and the answer was yes.   After twenty or thirty seconds, they separated and disappeared when they were about a mile apart, providing they were actually above I-90.  --  I can't rule out some sort of Laser light show, but it sure looked like an interdimensional light show to me.       -- Sincerely, J S;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
