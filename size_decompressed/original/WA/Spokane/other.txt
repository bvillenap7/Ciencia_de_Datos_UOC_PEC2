I was driving and heading toward the south and I thought at first that I was looking at a meteor coming down with a 30 to 45 degree angle towards the west.  The colors changed from white to purple to deep purple to red as it disappeared.  It was larger than a meteor.  I thought that it was about to hit the ground.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

After I got out side I spotted 2 objects in the sky the both of them appeared to be a triangle shape, they were moving in very rapidly, I’ve never been in airplane but I’m pretty sure the way they were moving wasn’t possible for a human made ship to move. The faster they moved they worse my head was getting, I couldn’t handle it any longer and I passed out when I awoke it was 9 at night. Also i was wondering what caused me to black out, if anyone at this reporting center knows please i would like to know  I know this sounds impossible to most people, but I know it’s the truth and that’s all that matters    ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My wife, son and myself were going to Spokane Washington to look at some houses that we were going to buy during the first week of this;2009-09-05 04:30:00;30 minutes;My wife, son and myself were going to Spokane Washington to look at some houses that we were going to buy during the first week of this Sept. 2009. We decided to drive all night because we have a disabled son that has a late schedule. Twenty miles out from Spokane on HWY 90 east around 4:30am we encountered several sparklers like things hovering over our car just off the right side of the windshield. I noticed that they were pacing our car as we drove. I felt like I was being hypnotized by the sparklers like objects. I noticed my wife and son staring at it and not saying a word about what was happening. I thought this was some kind of warning and felt very scared that something was going to happen to us. I was afraid to stop so I lowered my speed and shielded my eyes so I could not see them. By doing so I felt like I was not being affected by the attempt by them to hypnotized me. I was scared at this point and yelled out to my wife, Is it trying to hypnotiz! ed you, is it a warning of some kind. Cathy finally said something like I don't know what do they want? I kept looking down at the time and it didn't seem like it was changing even after a very long time and miles had past. I was thinking they wanted to hurt us or do something to the road ahead to hurt us. Each time I took my hand down from shielding my eyes I felt again they were trying to hypnotize me, like I was blacking out and not in control. I remember cars and trucks passing in the other direction and honking there horns at us as if they were seeing these things over our car. We begin praying and saying the lords prayer, it seem as if I could not think as if my mind went blank and I could not remember even what was happening to us and even what these things looked like. I had to put a memory into my head what they looked like or I think I wouldn't remember what they looked like. I remember saying to Cathy they look like giant sparklers at the same time she said it! . I thought they had gone away but they must have just moved a! way for a short time because I noticed they were back and I remember saying to Cathy no they are still here, don't look at them. She noticed my speed had dropped to 40 miles an hour in a 70 miles an hour zone and she told me to speed up or we were going to be hit from behind. Soon after that they left. I think that they tried to abduct us but were not able to because of the medication I take for depression. (Zoloft) I feel if I had not taken this medication that night we would of for sure been abducted by these strange devices that hovered over our car for such a long time that night.  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
What appeared to by a very large invisible craft making very loud, low frequency rumble.;2012-09-30 20:00:00;7 minutes;What appeared to by a very large invisible craft making very loud, low frequency rumble 8:00 Pm, Sunday, September, 2012  While sitting in outdoor hot tub with my wife, we began to hear a very deep rumble, similar to a jet engine but unlike any either had ever heard.  I turned the power off to the hot tub to locate the direction of the rumble which by now the vibration could be felt physically while in the water. The sound seemed to come from all directions, North, then South, East and West.  I could see no outline of an aircraft in all directions.  The sound increased as it appeared to fly over, but again, nothing appeared against the night sky…although commercial airlines were easily spotted along with their exhaust and/or contrails. As It seemed to pass to the West, I stepped out of the hot tub onto an adjoining deck and noticed two red light, similar to the port wing light of an aircraft although these did not flash.  Now, what was amazing was the distance between these lights.  I called my wife to jump up and look, which she did and also saw the lights which by now were several miles away.  The distance between these lights at best estimate was 2000’—and no siloutte of an aircraft.  We watch the lights disappear through the horizon, but the noise, still a very low rumble continued for another 4 – 5 minutes. Our home is situated within the apporach patterns of FAFB and have seen and heard aircraft from tankers to stealth fighter but have NEVER heard an engine noise of that low frequency or decibal level. That’s it.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
I looked out my window and saw this glowing light.  It was to bright and to big to be a star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2015-11-22 05:00:00;5 minutes +;I woke up to go to the bathroom at 5 o'clock in the morning.  After I finished, I looked out my window and saw this glowing light.  It was to bright and to big to be a star.  The light was pulsing on and off.  I was rubbing my eyes to make sure this was real.  After 5 minutes of me watching, it disappeared.   Then, after that, I stayed up for about 45 minutes, looking into the sky.  Then I eventually fell asleep, not seeing the object again.  The object looked like it had 5 separate lights almost like an atom particle.  The light it produced was white, like any standard light bulb color you can find in the store.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

It was staitionary for about five mins, then it defended strait down, and we knew it was not a star.  We drove towards it to get a better look.  At that point it seemed to start following us.  It became a game of cat and mouse for 45 minutes.  At one point it hovered over us.  When it wasn't in the bright star position, it appeared to have a blinking blue lift, and a blinking red light.  It flew over us about 200 feet off the ground, and looked like a flat streamlined jet, no sound, and when it tunned, it remains horizontal no wing tips, gluiding through the air.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
A massive humanoid shaped craft with white and yellow lights.;2019-06-05 03:30:00;30 seconds;A massive humanoid shaped craft with white and yellow lights. A friend and I were traveling east on highway 2, just about 2 miles before the Interstate 90 freeway entrance.  When suddenly to the south direction, I  noticed some very strange lights coming up over the trees heading west as we were going south.   This object was massive, I'd say it was a 1/2 mile away from our car, and from that distance, I would say that this thing was easily over 500 feet high and 3 to 400 feet wide.  It had two arms protruding out in front of it and it appeared to have a head and face in the middle.  It was making a very loud vibrating sound  and would occasionally rise up higher and was churning the ground up as it traveled and this object looked as if it had a large body or it was riding on a very large machine.   In the morning or when i woke up i had absolutely no memory of seeing this or did I even rememberthat i had filmed ir until 4 days ago when i was going through the video in my phone.  I didn't know what I was looking at when i watched t! he video until i played it a few times and some of that morning started to come back.  I want you to watch the video.  And please help me figure out what we saw.  I can tell you that this thing had a organic like appearance.  It qas a very powerfull sighting.

Three Loud Trumpet-like Blasts from the Sky;2019-06-13 19:00:00;<1 minute;Three Loud Trumpet-like Blasts from the Sky Somewhere between I would say 1900-1910 hours this evening (June 13, 2019), my husband and I were sitting outside in our little popup camper, enjoying the cooler air and listening for bird sounds.  The just out of the sky, we hear this enormously loud trumpet blast, three times! (He said it sounded more like a trombone because of its timbre.)   On my piano, I found the notes were within a four-key (such as C,E,E and F - a major key signature) and were slurred (no break in-between the four-note phrase).  Each blast lasted about a second.  So loud!  We both agreed we had never heard anything like this and have no idea what could've been its source except to say that it came from the sky!  We discussed all of the options we could think of and came up with nothing that we're aware of that could emit these blasts. We are both retired Federal employees.  I am a former Public Affairs Officer for the USFS. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Actually, we are located east of Reardon and west of Spokane (just west of the ATV park just west of the Spokane River) in a coulee.  I don't think I was very accurate in my description of where we were because I was still stirred up over that noise!  If you travel Highway 2 east of Reardon, Coulee Hite Road is a left hand turn off Highway 2.  We were sitting in our little pop up camper which we have set up on our ranch property right now it's so nice to enjoy our coffee there because it's cool (in the morning and evening) with the breezes.  I will ask our neighbors if they have heard any noises. We heard another one last night, but just a single loud blast however, it was different from the three blasts we heard the other evening.  In fact, my husband and I are still talking about it, racking our brains for trying to remember anything similar that we've heard but so far, no luck!

I had seen one extremely bright light.  Came into focus fast and hovered over building.  Dropped about 15' out of the air & rose about the same all in a matter of seconds.  Had some what of a crown but was hard to look at due to the blinding light.  Zipped away leaving a trail of light in it's path.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
V shaped almost invisible object seen;2020-08-20 21:05:00;3-4 seconds;V shaped almost invisible object seen On Thursday, August 20th, 2020 around 9:05pm in Spokane Washington My wife and I were outside sitting enjoying the night sky and having a cigarette, while looking upward at the stars, directly above my wife and I, a V shaped (not  full triangle shape, V craft) object was flying by going westward coming from the east direction flying over our head(s).  The object was almost invisible if you will.  Blended in with the sky except for, as strange as it may sound, had a very feint see through brownish color to it that blended in with the night sky.  Hard to explain but thats what caught my attention as it was flying byover us or i would of easily have missed it.  Like a clear blurred wave destorting the scenery. I pointed at it so the wife would see it.  We both were in awe.  Trying to figure out what type of craft it was or I should say what it was exactly.  No noise was heard from it.  As to how high it was in the sky, thats hard to say.  Best example i can give is If you held a full lenth #2 pencil up in the air with your arms stretched out and pencil held by fingers, showing from left to right, the length of the pencil, thats the width from left to right on the V shaped object or close to it. Using that, that should give an idea of height as well.  It was moving pretty fast. Saw maybe 3 to 4 seconds of it.  Pretty amazing actually. Just wish we could of seen it a bit longer for a better description.  Thhough as stated, it was almost invisible.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
