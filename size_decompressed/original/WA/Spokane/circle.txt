We don't have craft that can fly this fast and make right turns at several thousand miles per hour;1973-10-15 12:40:00;15 Minutes;We don't have craft that can fly this fast and make right turns at several thousand miles per hour I was working a couple of grave yard shifts out at the airport. As I came out of the main terminal lobby about 12:40 am I was with another gentleman to have a smoke. We looked north and saw about a dozen moving objects that looked liked stars in size, but were a distance off toward the north over what we knew was a military base, but as we watched these objects simply did what no flying object we have could do. They would fly at great speeds stop on a dime and at great speeds would make right angle turns that should smash any inhabitants like a bug from the inertia of such a turn.  The man I was with was some flight specialist and was able to determine speeds roughly and distance etc, because he was simply trained in such things - I thought maybe he was a pilot himself. But he told me quite frankly that the objects have to be traveling several thousand miles per hour in the “bursts” of speed. They would all suddenly fly into one place as to meet, then fly apart in different direction and stop on a dime - staying there for a short time. Some would fly then other directions and take those right turns without slowing or stopping. You just can’t watch that kind of thing and think that we have any aircraft whatsoever that has that kind of ability. They did seem to glimmer from a bright whitish to other colors, but our distance from them it was hard to distinguish it and then - after near 10 - 12 minutes of watching this “dance in the sky” - they all flew off it different directions like a 4th of July exploding flare shot. And, no - it was no firework show either. Even if it were fireworks - even that is NOT allowed over the military base that we were watching this happen over. I had never known anyone to have ever reported this before now. The thing is - that the very next night on another grave yard shift at about closer to 2 am I saw the very same thing. This time about 5 people were standing outside watching it and I had told them I had seen it the night before as well - just didn’t know what it was, but said - nothing can fly like those things that we have - so it’s something else.  Having had a friend who used to work with NASA I had discussed with him my theory that these are not inter planetary, but rather inter-dimensional and the discussion turned into the color changing issue as they change and right when they disappear from site is at the ultra-violet or infra-red spectrum so the idea of inter-dimensional seemed to fit with that scenario and the idea of the speeds and right turns they could make without getting hurt would indicate this same idea - that, inter dimensionally they could pull this off. So, that’s my story.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Five orbs the size of hot air balloons  rotated each other for 5 seconds and sped away at about 1 oclock.;2007-07-07 22:00:00;60 seconds;Five orbs the size of hot air balloons  rotated each other for 5 seconds and sped away at about 1 o'clock. Sighting of Dancing Orbs over Spokane Community College, Spokane, Washington at 10.09 PM on 7-7-07 .  After leaving the computer room on the first floor of the park Towers Apts, a 180 unit 20 story high apt complex I went to my apt #1905 on the 19th floor. This apt faces east across Division Street, and I can see all the Lights of East Spokane and the Spokane Valley looking down to the River, The Spokane Community college. I can see the lights of the lights Valley Mall about 7miles east of my apartment, which is about 190 feet above street level. Y W a friend of mine living on the 17th floor came up to my apt to listen to the Coast to Coast radio program, we usually listen to George Noory together most evenings from 10 to 11 PM. She brought with her a bag of micro-waved popcorm and she then sat next to the window looking east while I found a container to pour the hot bag of popcorn into. I then sat down beside her and after a few moments there appeared lights out side our window. Yvone ask, what are those. I answered they look like UFO’s to me, and I opened the window wide so we could get a clearer view of a spectacle taking place in the sky. We saw 5 orbs each one looked exactly the same as all the others the were glowing the color of a soft pink similar to the color of the rising moon at night. The were all in a straight line of 5 round orbs or discs straight up into the sky. The were approximately 1, 500 feet away right over the Spokane Community College and were approximately 500 feet above the ground. Each one was moving in rotation around each other. This was a sight of beauty that reminded me later of looking down upon a group of square dancers. You know the doe, see, doe, and spin your partner type thing. The size of each of the 5 orbs or balls was the same, each was approximatly the size of a hot air baloon. There was no sound as they continued to circle around each other in the sky in front of our ring side seats. The speed of each rotation was a complete rotation took less than one second. After viewing this for about 5 seconds I decided to get a picture of this strange scene and rose up to find a camera. At the same time I ask Yvone to keep her eyes on the orbiting orbs. A few seconds later Yvone said they were no longer visible and described them all rising together at an angle to the right rather than straight up. She also said that the color faded out and the last she could see was the out line or a circle of each one without the each soft orange color.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Circular, silver object  flying with jet east over Spokane, April 11, 2011;2011-04-08 12:40:00;3 minutes;Circular, silver object  flying with jet east over Spokane, April 11, 2011 We were standing outside of a theatre, looked up and saw a large jet, very high/silver and red on the fuselage, so appeared to be a commercial jet - and above it, to the right side, there was a silver, circular object (ball shaped/sphere) that was travelling with it at the same speed.   This jet was very high - it was a clear, sunny day, (today, April 8th, 2011) and the object appeared to be angled to the right side, higher than the jet but cruising along at the same speed, same path of flight. We watched until the jet left our view.   This happened over a period of about 3 minutes.  The jet was flying over Spokane. Again, this was a large jet at cruising altitude. It was travelling east.  The witnesses include two adults, one teenager, 3 children.   We each speculated what it could be and it was not, and could not, have been part of the plane as it was not attached.  Given the height of the jet, the object had to be relatively close to have been noticed but it! was definitely discernable as a separate object.  There was no jet stream from the object like there was from the plane, and it had no propellant system that was visible.  We definitely had a clear view of the plane and object.  In contrast to the largeness of the jet, the object appeared to be about a 1/4 of the size.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Came home from store at 9:30 p.m.  Noticed a very large extremely bright circular object moving from northwest to southeast.  It moved very quickly and steadily.  It had no other lights around it, it was not an airplane, it was silent.  When it had travelled over our house we saw  an airplane flying towards it, the object then seemed to lose brightness and turn almost yellow while getting smaller and flickering a few ties then disappeared.

Two white circles covering 65 degrees in 4 seconds;2013-05-12 00:10:00;4 seconds;Two white circles covering 65 degrees in 4 seconds I took my dog out for one last job between 12:10 and 12:20am on Sunday May 12th (early mothers day).  I was out there for less than a minute when I thought I saw a shooting star in my peripheral vision almost directly above me.  Upon focusing on it I saw two white circles, not like bright directional shining lights normally seen on a plane but just white circles.  I initially thought it could be one object total but it could be two separate in the same path of travel as the white circles were separated.  The white circles were about the same size around as a #2 pencil held out at arms length and they were spaced out to fit about two of those #2 pencil diameters in between them.  It was moving very fast from East to West.  I saw it from about 90 degrees to about 25 degrees above the horizon.  I could tell it was pretty high up because the sky was clear straight up and all the way to the east but to the west there was some very thin cloud cover that I was able to sti! ll see bright stars through and I could see the white circles slightly dim as it went behind one narrow cloud then get brighter after it passed over it into the clear for a bit and then went behind more cloud cover and got smaller the further away it was and dimmed and then it was gone. This all happened very fast. I estimate the total time from it first catching my eye till it went out of sight was 4 seconds. I know for a fact it was not a plane or a satellite. Way too incredibly fast to be either. The object made no noise. It was purely silent. I also pulled up airplane radar flight records online between 12:10 and 12:20 and there was no planes flying over the city in this timeframe. I talked to an individual at a local airport about it and they stated that it could be a secret military aircraft as they fly those in the middle of the night so they aren't easily seen. Whether this is true or not I have no idea. It suppose it could be as it was headed in the direction of a ! nearby air force base.  About me: I'm in my twenties, have very good eyesight and don't use glasses/contacts, have good hearing etc.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

What I believed makes this sighting so great  is that we saw a passenger plane flying about 2000k ft. below the ufo(the ufo was extremely high in the sky) so we could get a real reference of how fast the ufo was going which was a lot faster than the plane at a much higher altitude.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

There were several circular, blinking lights in the sky.  Some were reddish in hue that blinked and pulsed white and very, very quickly--a greenish light.  There was a bright gold star-like light that moved then was hovering over the area.  There were three to four white, blinking lights that seemed to be aware that I was watching them.  When I waved at them, hoping they would be able to see me, their movements became more rapid and longer in distance.   During the three hours I was walking around in and out of the Hangman Hills neighborhood, I saw five to six shooting stars.  However, I realized after the third one that they were moving a bit slowly to be shooting starts, and I believe that they were craft, dipping in and out of perhaps our dimension, or perhaps my disbelief and excitement prohibited me from being able to perceive them for a prolonged amount of time.   As I continued watching, different craft would become seen by me that were closer and closer to me.  I truly believe that they wanted to be seen and the whole experience was very peaceful, calm and loving.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

I saw this happen twice between the span of 30 to 45 minutes.  The first one was sighted roughly around midnight and the second one, roughly 30 or so minutes later.   I tried to capture it on my camera, but was unable too.  I only witnessed this happening two times through the 3 hours I was taking photographs to the east, but it really stood out as unusual.   There was air traffic turning and coming in from the east to the west to land at Spokane International Airport (GEG), but what I saw did not resemble any kind of aircraft nor was it moving and transitioning through the sky, as it was stationary.   Object/Light appeared to be about 2,000 to 3,000 feet in elevation and about halfway between the Summit of Mount Spokane and Newman Lake, which resides to the South.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Moving circular white light/object slows down, merges with second, smaller light, combined object turns 90 degrees, and disappears.;2018-12-30 21:30:00;~1 minutes;Moving circular white light/object slows down, merges with second, smaller light, combined object turns 90 degrees, and disappears. We had barbequed a turkey at my folks place southeast of Spokane, WA.  Most of my family was there, including two sisters, two B-i-l’s, mom, dad (skeptic) and me.  My two sons had gone home to Washington earlier in the day.  Well, I like an occasional cigarette after dinner and Tim, my skeptical brother-in-law is a confirmed addict.  We went out on the back porch to smoke after dinner.  It was very dark, very clear, and cold.  I happened to look up and saw a white circular light/object moving from west to east and very high up (seemed to be anyway.)   This light was very much like one I’d seen about 10 years ago in Fall City, WA. (reported to NUFORC) but seemed higher up.  If I hold my hand straight up and away, the object would have been about 1/8th of an inch or so wide.  Much bigger than any star.  Once again it appeared to be a weird, “confined” light.  I immediately shouted “look at that” and pointed at it.  Tim looked up and didn’t say anything, but he wa! s watching.  He saw it. The light approached a smaller, less well-defined white light that looked like a big star.  My first thought was “satellite” but the moving object seemed too big for that.  Then it slowed down and seemed to merge with the smaller light, then they both changed direction to the south and poof, they disappeared. Several observations:  It was much larger than any star in the sky and once again it was that weird, seemingly confined white light.  Not terribly bright, but very obviously moving.  If I pick a spot on the ceiling of my office, while sitting in my chair, the object would appear to have moved about 1 foot across the ceiling/starfield, if that makes sense. When we first saw it, it was moving, once again, in what seemed a purposeful way (we’ve discussed this before) from west to east.  Tim saw it almost immediately after I did and we both saw it slow down and approach another light/object that was similar in color, but appeared smaller – maybe ½ the size.  They came together and became a single light/object – no size change.  Once they merged together, they turned but not in an immediate, 90 degree turn that is often described and seems physically impossible.  This was more gradual, as though going around a corner, but a sharp corner.  In the previous ceiling example, it would’ve executed the turn over just a couple of inches.  Then it was moving to the south.  While we were both staring at it, it just blinked out.  Gone.  We waited a bit, looking, but no other objects appeared to be moving.  I asked him “you saw that didn’t you!”  He said “yeah, I did….and it was weird.”  He was obviously taken aback.  Not quite shaken really, but definitely weirded out.  I can’t tell you how happy I was to have someone else see it.  We went back in and I told the group around table that we’d seen a UFO!  We'd all had a couple of drinks and they all jeered a bit, of course, but I think that Tim’s behavior caught them off guard.  They know him very, very well and know he’d be jeering too if it hadn’t been quite a sight.  It was that, alright.  I checked on the ISS and it was in the sky, but much later that night.  I also check flightaware, etc., there were airliners up of course, but this wasn’t an airliner.  Airplanes don’t slow down that way and then execute a quite sharp turn. It was almost an instantaneous 90 deg. turn, but not quite.  No noise of course.  Don’t know what it was, but for now at least, we know it was a UFO.  I don’t know if these things are extraterrestrial or not, but I would sure like to know. I need to report to Nurforc and will do so tonight.  Should’ve called Peter D. before now, but was very busy and oddly, I didn’t t! hink to do it immediately, nor did either of us think of trying to pull out a phone.  It was one of those things where we were both sort of stunned by what we were seeing.  I’ll give it more thought and file a report with Nuforc and Mufon tonight.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Lights over Spokane at night, NOT A UFO but something monitoring the area over area above little Spokane River & Country Club;2020-08-16 01:30:00;every evening for the las;Lights over Spokane at night, NOT A UFO but something monitoring the area over area above little Spokane River & Country Club Over the last couple of nights I noticed again a number of large lights stationary in different sections of the sky over the north side and 7 mile, and 9 mile area of Spokane.  Over the last three nights they have moved and then look stationary for the most part.  To me it looks like a drone but fiully lit up very bright.  I think they rotate but with my binoculars and spotting scope I can't get close enough to make a skilled judgment?  last year I witnessed something similar over my area, little Spokane River down river for the Spokane country club about 2 miles.  Last year though they were moving all over and it looked as if they were testing large drones at night?  It also looked as if there is a docking station the other small drones come to.  That was last year, those year the ones I'm seeing tonight seem to be moving really slow to the right but it takes hours.  The lights are not high enough to be stars, not moving enough to be anything falling out of the sky, and they are definitely not flying around with any sort of speed.  I looked up drones and they said that the police are using drones for the last couple of years to locate missing people and to solve crimes.  These look like things that are simply being placed in the air each night and are watching/looking/monitoring something? I would just like to know what the hell they are? In addition, I'm almost positive there are smaller ones up higher or the same kind  just higher than the ones below right out in front of my place at a lower elevation.
