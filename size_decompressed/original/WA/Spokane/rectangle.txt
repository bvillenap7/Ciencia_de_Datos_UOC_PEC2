Looked like a scaffold or a playground jungle Gym  (maybe a space station)   First sighting   Age 88. No telescope or binoculars. Don't know how to copy and paste.   How are things in Harrington?;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Large, low-flying square aircraft with lights in each corner moves quickly then makes a right turn;2008-02-05 19:10:00;Approx. 2 minutes;Large, low-flying square aircraft with lights in each corner moves quickly then makes a right turn I was out shoveling with my brother and a friend, and we saw this large, perfect-square aircraft over head, which had lights in each corner.  It moved fairly fast before stopping, turning to the right, and continuing on at a lower altitude.  Have seen a similar aircraft before about 20 miles away.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Box with wings flying low and fast.;2013-10-26 17:30:00;1 minute;Box with wings flying low and fast At around 5:30 I saw a large rectangle shape under a pair of wings flying low near I-90 and Freya.  The object had no propellers or engines but did have a white/blue strobe light on top.  From the side it appeared to be towing the object and the wings were at a 45 degree angle like when a plane takes off. It went straight from South to North and disappeared with in a minute.  When I wa directly behind it the wings looked huge like 70' or so, and were barely visible, like they were 3 inches thick.  Strange sight can't explain!;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
