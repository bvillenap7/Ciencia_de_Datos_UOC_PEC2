Orange glowing ball (sphere) seen in Spokane sky in the Summer of 1975;1975-07-19 23:30:00;3 mins;Orange glowing ball (sphere) seen in Spokane sky in the Summer of 1975 While laying in sleeping bags in the backyard of our Spokane Valley home on a summer's night in 1975, my older brother and I, at approximately 11:30pm were star gazing the clear sky watching for falling stars when an orange glowing ball (sphere) flew directly above us from east to west.  We could not stop talking about it that night and decided that we would go up into the foothills by our home the next day to search for it.  It seemed so low, like only a thousand feet above us.  I recently read a book called Search for the Skinwalker which made reference to a military base in Montana that had logged a glowing round UFO crossing their skies that same night back in 1975.  So I thought I would file a report here and see if any other Spokane-area people witnessed it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1975 may be approximate.  PD));47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Five minuets later they moved in perfect syncronicity and seemed to vanish ever so serene behind nothingness. I do not understand what I saw. Or Why I saw it.

Bright Star-like object hovered/drifted/changed direction then disappeared.;1999-08-20 14:00:00;20 min;Bright Star-like object hovered/drifted/changed direction then disappeared. While waiting at taxi terminal at Spokane International Airport I spotted a star-like object almost directly overhead - slightly to north.  Luminosity like the planet Venus.  Moved slowly from east to west, then changed direction moved from north to south.  Above high clouds.  Clouds moving south to north. Flickered in sunlight like highly reflective surface changing aspect.  Appeared to be a second lobe underneath first when flickering.  Lost sight of object when it flickered and went dark.  Total sighting time 20 - 30 minutes. Original gaze was occasioned by criss-cross of persistant vapor trails above Spokane that were emitted by white tanker planes seen on approach for landing.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

pulsating bright light in southwest towards airway heights exploding and peicing together before final big explosion then vanished.;2005-04-13 22:53:00;17 min;pulsating bright light in southwest towards airway heights exploding and peicing together before final big explosion then vanished. i was out in my hot tub and started to go inside when i noticed a light pulsating in the southwest corner of the sky and knew it wasnt a star so i ran inside and grabbed the video camera and the stand and went back out and started filming it. It was incredably bright and looked as if it was exploding then peicing back together and it did this for about 7 minutes then i zoomed in on it and it expoded huge then disapeared into the night sky. I was gonna send the tape in the following week but then my house was robbed and my camera with the tape in it was stolen. This event was similar with the lights seen in texas.....this is truly unexplained ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Black sphere with  red rotating light flying silent in sky.;2009-06-18 21:20:00;1 minute;Black sphere with  red rotating light flying silent in sky. At about 920 pm tonight I was standing on my front porch when I observed a small black object moving across the sky it was approximately the size of a small car or golf cart. It had a red light that was spinning over the top and back under I would say it was oval or maybe football shaped approximate flying at 500 ‘-750 ‘ it moved quite quickly and absolutely silent.  It was the silence that sent chills up my spine. I am absolutely certain after seeing what I saw that it could not be a plane or helicopter. I was an air traffic controller in the u.s.n. I know aircraft. This was something else.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
3 spheres in sunset sky;2013-02-14 16:00:00;~7 minutes;3 spheres in sunset sky My husband and I were driving home to Seattle via I-90 from Spokane it was 16:00hrs.  I was taking many photos due to the strange sky above - I did not see these 3 spheres at the time as my focus was on the Sunset but also the Sun high above, then we witnessed a second Sunset later on.   It was only when I got home did I notice the 3 spheres in a triangle formation.  There seems to be one yellow one in the center, and two orange/red spheres to the side.  These were taken through the windscreen, however they are not on the windscreen as they move position in the sky, these are distant objects.  Please see photos;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Orange Spherical Orbs doing a Brilliant Show over the City sky.  Over 10 witnesses on the scene.;2013-10-05 20:45:00;15 minutes;Orange Spherical Orbs doing a Brilliant Show over the City sky.  Over 10 Witnesses on the scene I am a ((job description deleted)) at the ((deletd)) here in Spokane, Washington.   Last night upon entering our ((deleted--work area)) on my 1st round at 8:45 pm immediately I could see a number of highly luminous glowing orange spherical objects (orb like) through the trees as I looked west over the roof of our ((deleted)) toward the Convention Center of the Downtown area.   Having witnessed 3 of these objects 4 months ago and since having heard the sweeping reports from all over the country, I knew this was going to be a big event that I wanted as many people as possible to see.   So I immediately ran into our ((deleted--area))  and summoned as many interested witnesses as I could by asking everyone if they wanted to witness some UFO’s.  First thing I had our ((deleted)) attendant accompany me as he along with many of his neighbors had personally witnessed over thirty of these same objects traveling through a couple weeks before I had over 4 months ago.  When we and the some 10 to 12 guests arrived on the scene, we were all amazed and perplexed at the show the near dozen of these firey orange objects were putting on as they floated around drifting upward and slowly gliding around from north to south with their distinctive luminous orange glow.   Because I was trying to acquire as many witnesses as possible, I was unable to closely examine the movements and activity of the objects for very long.  However, from what I did witness, they appeared and acted exactly the same as those I had witnessed some months back. After about 7 minutes had passed, and I was scrambling to get more witnesses to observe the phenomena and get it recorded, suddenly all but a few ((deleted)) came back in side and said they all just vanished.   I then worked my way back out and there remained one mother and her daughter who showed me the one orange ufo remaining.  They told me that after all the ufos vanished and everyone left, this one object suddenly lit up and remained as it was hovering with its’ distinct orange glow.   We watched on for a few minutes as this object stayed hovering only to lose its luminosity and vanish in thin air like the others…   The mother then showed me the multiple pictures she took with her smart phone and I gave her my email address and she got my name and insisted that her and her daughter would email me the pictures as well as a detailed account of what they witnessed. As I write this report, I am still waiting and hoping she delivers on her words. This was an extraordinary event witnessed by over 10 people who were all mesmerized by the show these objects put on.  In fact a couple ((deleted)) came to me afterwards and thanked me very much for alerting them so they could witness the extraordinary phenomena.   In hindsight, however it was very disconcerting to me that 2 of the teenagers who caught the whole incident on video went right back into the ((deleted)) showed just a few people and then went right back to watching a football game like nothing even happened.  When I asked them if they could put the footage on youtube they just kind of blew me off like they didn’t care.  I wish I had given them some money in exchange for the footage as it was the type of ufo event that many people hope to see their lifetime…;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Multiple orange orbs over downtown Spokane.;2013-10-05 21:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple orange orbs over downtown Spokane. While driving south through downtown Spokane- passing Spokane Club on the right.  I looked out of the drivers window while stopped at traffic light.  I noticed a steady orange light between the tree branches to my left.  The light was some distance above the trees, at about a 60 degree angle relative to my car.   I pointed out the object to my wife and opened the moon roof of the car so she could see.  My son in the back seat just behind me also saw the object.   At that time I noticed two other bright orange objects but lower and seemed to be following the first object spotted yet the tree were in a line from west to east.  The traffic light had changed so I needed to move and briefly thought they might have been military aircraft.  These lights did not make a sound I could hear, were not common aircraft light colors, and did not strobe so I dismissed that idea.  The lights were moving east-to-west against the prevailing winds which would exclude luminaria.  I thought the lights were very odd.   We proceeded south to the freeway onramp since we were headed home to the east in Spokane Valley.  I told my wife and son the keep an eye out for the objects we had just seen since I had to drive.  The highway is elevated above the city so we had a better view above the buildings.  I glanced several times over my shoulder to the left toward the objects.  I was able to get a good estimate of the altitude.  There were three objects I could clearly make out, but possibly four or five, since I was driving I was only able to focus on the first three objects.  Object furthest to the west (which I believe was the first object) was at about 1250 feet, the second two were at about 450 feet (above ground level).  They were about evenly spaced about 500 feet apart horizontally.  From I-90 the first object was roughly over Masonic Temple with the last object being over River Park Square.  I could clearly triangulate from the first sighting, the freeway sightings, and using size of the buildings in downtown Spokane for a reference.   After getting home I dropped off my wife, son and car at the house, this was about 2110.  I got in my truck and headed back downtown to investigate the objects, while driving to roof of parking garage at Sacred Heart Medical Center there was a brief flash of light in the pickup,  I think this was a mercury vapor streetlamp flashing or a surge to the truck cab lamp so not concerned.  Only stopped briefly to observe on the top level of west parking garage at SHMC.  No objects visible over Spokane at this time.   Returned home at 2130.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Shiny spherical object traveling across sky SE-NW direction, hovers for 10 mins in NW, then leaves in N-S direction.;2014-01-05 12:00:00;15 minutes;Shiny spherical object traveling across sky SE-NW direction, hovers for 10 mins in NW, then leaves in N-S direction I was in my kitchen making lunch and I noticed my neighbors (about 5 of them, one who is retired military) were all outside talking, pointing and looking at the sky, and one of them had binoculars.  So I went out to see what was up. It was noon and the sky was absolutely clear of clouds. I observed was a spherical object moving across the sky, coming from the SE, headed in a NW direction. It was moving at a steady speed, slower than a satellite, maybe as fast as an airplane that was REALLY high (so I am guessing around 500-800 miles per hour).  The object appeared to be higher than most aircraft fly around here, but still definitely within the atmosphere.  It was extremely shiny.  It glinted a lot as it reflected the bright noon-time sunshine.  The light it reflected was white, which gave me the impression that the object was silvery and metallic.  It was hard to make out any details other than light, but because it was so evenly reflective, it seemed like it must have had a smooth surface. The object moved at a constant speed across much of the sky, about 75 degrees above the NE horizon once directly overhead, all the way from the SE horizon until almost to the NW horizon, in about 5 minutes time, until it stopped and just sat in one spot about 25 degrees above the horizon for about 10 minutes.  It still seemed round and very shiny.  I thought it was a single light, but my husband and my daughter thought they could sometimes see two lights, very, very close together.  It glinted a lot, like the object or the surface was moving ever so slightly, even while seemingly standing still.  There was never a time when there was not light reflecting from the object it just changed in intensity, like a silver beaded windchime blowing in the breeze (but without any visible change in direction). After a bit, the object started to move again, toward the South, at the same speed as before. It soon went behind my neighbor's trees, from my vantage point, and the object was so far away and it was so bright outside that I couldn't find it again.  After a bit, the neighbors lost it too and went back inside.  During the sighting, there were no other aircraft in the sky (which is not very common around here, since the Spokane Airport and Fairchild Air Force Base are only about 10 miles away). However, about 10 minutes after the UFO disappeared, I noticed two airplanes in the sky (with an obvious airplane shape to each of them, as opposed to the UFO), and both left distinct contrails. The UFO had left no trails at all, even though it was traveling at jet speeds.  The UFO did not give off any sound that was audible to me, but neither did those two airplanes, so it doesn't mean the craft didn't make noise way up high. If I were to guess, I would say this object was larger than a Boeing 747, but not more than twice as large.  After the sighting, it seemed like there was more airplane traffic than usual, but it may just been because we were looking to the sky more than usual. Again, we live close to an airport and a base, so airplanes are common in our skies.  The thing that makes this sighting stand out to me is the fact that the object had been moving in a NW direction, stopped and hovered in one spot for several minutes, and then started moving in a S direction. No airplane I have ever seen can hover like that, nor does it look round. Drones have wings or arms for rotors, so they should look more irregular than a sphere, and they shouldn't be as large as this was. No helicopter I have ever seen appears to be silver and round and that large when that high in the air (one would have been a speck). The ISS and satellites do not stop and then change direction.  I have never before seen a UFO and I was so shocked by this sighting that I watched, dumbfounded. I was worried I wouldn't be able to locate it again if I went for my camera, plus I wasn't sure if my camera would capture more than a glinty speck because the object was so far away. After the fact, I regret that I didn't dash quickly for my cell phone and get a video of this so as to share it with friends and family.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Large bright stationary spherical object appearing to be with earth atmosphere about 45 degrees above horizon.;2014-02-05 15:20:00;3-4 minutes;Large bright stationary spherical object appearing to be with earth atmosphere about 45 degrees above horizon Driving SW on I-90 from Spokane Valley, Washington, I observed a very bright stationary spherical object in the SW sky for 3-4 min.  The object was moon-like in appearance minus the shadows, and was clearly in front of the thin layer of clouds and sunrays which were behind and above the object.   It was very bright, glowing, light gold with a very smooth surface -luminescent rather than metallic.  It appeared to be solid – light was not reflecting through it.  Size is difficult to guess, altho it seemed to be quite large and about a 45 degree angle above the horizon.   No clue as to distance or height, however, it was close enough to see details.   Outline of object was distinct with sky behind darker than object itself.  It remained stationary, but appeared to turn and change to a slightly faceted shape with what appeared to be two small triangular fins one above the other, protruding from behind.  The fins appeared to be of the same material and color.   As I continued driving SW toward the object, I saw a very small, very black spot which at first appeared and disappeared so I wasn’t sure if I actually was seeing it.   The black spot appeared to expand until it was very clearly a rectangular shape located on the lower right quadrant (from my viewpoint).  It remained visible, but rectangular shape appeared to change to an hour glass shape.   The object remained stationary, but the descending sun made it more and more difficult to view.   At this point, the terrain obscured my view as I drove behind and up up a small hill.  At the top of the hill (about a minute later), I had full view of the SW sky and the object was gone.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

I didn't feel excited or happy, it made me feel scared.  I watered my plants in a hurry and still felt uneasy about it.  It was probably less than 50 yards above me.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Black shiny orb over west Spokane during evening storm.;2014-08-02 18:22:00;30 seconds;Black shiny orb over west Spokane during evening storm. A storm was approaching Spokane at 18:20pm, 8-2-2014, and the lights began to flicker in my house.   I went outside (still daylight with clouds ) to observe the storm and noticed strong winds pushing to the Northeast and birds scattering around.  Then a black shiny polished looking orb flies over in a perfect trajectory flying S.E. (like the ISS, I see it fly over at night alot)  The elevation could be around 2 - 4 hundred feet.   It could not have been affected by the wind as it seemed to be in an orbit like the ISS.  Did not make a sound and I continued watching until it went out of sight in the far S.E. and I know it wasn't ISS because this was under the clouds, black and much larger.   It did not appear to change in elevation during the 30 seconds it was viewable.  Again it was black and had a shiny polished look to it.   The size was not large from my perspective about the size of a half dollar at arm's length at its closest from my back yard it was just a bit east of my position in west Spokane but almost straight over so I got a good look at it.  I watched it until it got smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible.

On Aug. 15, 2014, around 8:00 PM just after sunset in Spokane, Washington State, on the northeast side of town, my neighbors, my wife, and I were having a BBQ, when I noticed a green flash move very quickly across the sky.  I asked if anyone else had seen the light and they replied with a no.   About ten minutes later, my wife had asked, “Is that the Lights you saw?”  I said yes.   Then we realized that this was not normal, it was too large to be an online purchased drone, and it was not an airplane or a helicopter because there was no rotor noise and we would have heard it at the distance we were.   The craft was between 10 and 20 feet long and was emitting a bright green light with a faint red light with it.   This vehicle hovered for a few moments, then went vertical, horizontal, and even maneuvered in what appeared to be a 180 instant turn around without having to bank like a plane or helicopter, then it slowly descended behind the trees as if it were coming down to land.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Orb in night sky zipped quickly across sky, hovered, and disappeared;2021-03-01 20:15:00;30 seconds;Orb in night sky zipped quickly across sky, hovered, and disappeared Three adults witnessed an orb-like object in the night sky.   Sky was mostly clear, with a few faint clouds.  Bright starlight.  Orb appeared seemingly out of nowhere as a fast-moving object moving more or less horizontally across the landscape, pretty close to the tree line.  From our vantage point the orb appeared from the direction of the star Sirius and travelled east to west.   Orb appeared to be black or translucent (night sky was dark) with a white-ish circular outline.  A “fire tail” appeared off the backside, looked mostly white/orange/red, as it moves through the sky.   Like a tail.   After zipping across the sky, the orb stopped instantly and hovered for 3-5 seconds.   Then either disappeared instantly or zoomed away parallel to our point of reference so quickly it appeared to disappear?   Total event was 15-25 seconds.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
