Triangular Craft on Dishman Mica Road - Spokane, WA;1986-08-15 18:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular Craft on Dishman Mica Road - Spokane, WA Dad was driving down Dishman Mica Road at night, I was sitting in back and saw a small dark triangular craft flying just above the telephone/treeline. The craft was flying ahead parallel to the car and once I saw the craft, it appeared to fall back and fly side by side, looked to be a one man triangle craft with dull blinking lights and was completely silent. No one else in the car saw it and appeared to be watching us for the duration of the drive on Dishman Mica Road (about 5 min). I looked away to tell my parents and looked back and saw the craft fly away slowly. It didn't look to be in a hurry, though I was able to make out a shape in the cockpit. I have never seen a craft fly so low and be so quiet. That is why my parents probably didn't notice it.  All this happened in the mid 80's while I was a kid, the whole family was in the car. The date above is very approximate. I'm sure it was Fall because of how early darkness was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Dark boomerange object seen for ten minutes hovering over the freeway with a bright light out the front that lit up the fields. No jet ;1998-10-10 20:30:00;10 minutes;Dark boomerange object seen for ten minutes hovering over the freeway with a bright light out the front that lit up the fields. No jet or helecopter sound whatsoever. I was driving S. on I-90 about 30 miles SW of Spokane WA, when off in the distance I spotted a bright light.  I assumed that it was a satalite.  It got brighter and brighter, so I began to watch it closely.  We seemed to be coming up on the object, and I then thought that it was a jet plane with its light on.  It did not seem to be approaching us however, as we saw the light for at least ten minutes. As we approached the object, it was evident that it was NOT moving, but hovering directly over the freeway.  Its light was lighting up the freeway and the surrounding fields, as a plane light would, but it was not moving!  It was light like a search light it guess?  About that bright.   My assumption was that of a Harrier Jumpjet, but as we drove under the object, the was absolutely NO jet sound, and we did not notice a tail. The object was boomerag shaped, with green and red lights on the end of the wings I did not stop, as we were in a line of cars traveling together home to Portland OR, and as that my wife was petrified of the object, but everyone we were traveling with saw it, and could not explain it. I was not going to report it, as I thought that it was military considering the red and green lights on the ends, but there is no military base that I know of out there, and after hearing the womans report from Portland OR, on the Art Bell show of a triangular object in the sky with no sound, it sounded awfully familiar, and I though it was my duty to give the info I had, valid or not.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Had a transparent triangle shape around central light As an ameteur astronomer I was entertaining a friend with the telescope,then we quit and just looked up at a nice night sky,and saw what we thought was a satellite, a single white light, travelling over Spokane from n.w. to s.e., but I thought this light was moving a little faster than the average satellite,(which I observe regularly, and can often identify the type of satellite). It continued straight for five seconds, then made an eighty degree left turn to the n.e. in about a quarter of a second, continued in a straight path for another four or five seconds, then made another quarter second right turn to due east. We observed it for two or three more seconds, then it appeared to vanish. As it passed through several star fields, my friend noted he could make out what appeared to be a sort of transparent triangle shape around the central light, which I did not notice. He said it was rather large,as large as the full moon. We guessed the craft was quite low to the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  A satellite in low earth orbit almost certainly would not be visible from the ground at 0330 hrs. (local) in November.  At that time, a satellite would be on the side of the earth that is shaded from the sun's illumination, so there would be no ambient light for a satellite to reflect.));47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Triangular shaped UFO silently flies over Spokane, Wa. August 5th, 1999;1999-08-05 01:30:00;5-10 min.;Triangular shaped UFO silently flies over Spokane, Wa. August 5th, 1999 On the 5th of August, 1999, I was lying on my balcony looking up at the stars.  At about 1:30 am an object came into view.  If I hadn't been looking straight up, I never would have seen it.  It blocked out the stars as it flew overhead, but it was not lit up.  It made absolutely no sound.  I'm not sure just how large it was because I don't know how high it was flying but I could see it well enough to see detail on it. It was as big as a plane would be if it were flying quite low, as if it were going to land soon. I could tell it was metallic because it was reflecting the lights from the city. It was a perfect triangle with rounded corners. It had a circle on each corner as if they were lights, but as I said it was not lit up when I saw it. There was also a circle directly in the middle of the triangle. I froze when I saw it. I watched it fly from east to west until it was no longer in sight. It did not fly very fast, about the same as an airplane, but it was no airplane I've ever seen before. I guess it could have been a secret government craft, but I know it was not like the Stealth or anything like that. It was obvious that it didn't want to be seen. As soon as it was out of sight, I got up and wrote the exact time and date of what I saw in my diary, and I drew a picture of it. The next day I told my mother what I had seen, and she said she had seen the same object the night before, except when she saw it she said it had a green neon glow around it. I would like to know if anyone else saw what I saw around the same time.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

3 unidentified obects moving from east to west went through Spokane on 9-14-02 at 5:15 am and then many jets followed;2002-09-14 05:15:00;25 - 30 minutes;3 unidentified obects moving from east to west went through Spokane on 9-14-02 at 5:15 am and then many jets followed It was 5:15 in the morning, I heard a noise that blended in with the sound of the freeway nearby downtown spokane, it sounded like a volkswagon bug or chopper sound mixed with a king of whiring or whishing freguency, that whent wishzzz. So the  sound went chuk chuk chuk whishzzzz, it was very mechanical, I thought mabe a helicopter, but the whishzz confirmed negative on the helicopter, so I looked out the second story window to the east from downtown spokane. I first noticed a cat on the front lawn who was uncannily looking up at the sky toward the east, thats when I saw what looked like a planet, solid white light. Then I noticed it moving towards me (westerly) I thought maybe a plane ,until the light made some loops, half moons, figure eight, and right angles, by then I was waking my girlfriend on the couch, saying listen carefully to the freeway, and notice the other noise, she heard it and then I said look at this, and pointed. So I went downstairs to get a better look outside, I sat down for about 20 minutes watching, it then hovered in place (bobbing motion I could slightly detect, I then seen the second obect which was to the southeast of me, or south of the first obective. The both stopped for about 6-10 minutes, leaving me to wonder if I was seeing anything at all but stars and planets. Then the starting moving again, The first one did some pretty impossible moves and angles, and then I saw the additonal lights come on. There where three in all, One at the top and two and the bottom. It then went back to one light, and cycled to 2 lights before returing to one light. It then appeared to move far away and fade and then move close and brighten, this happened numerous times, before stopping and freezing again. Then the second light which was flashing different colors, blue white and green I think, it was flashing very quickly, and making some very acrobat movements which are not possible in our technology, right angles, etc.  It stopped moving at the same time as the first obect, I then seen the ! third ob ect briefly, it was further away, and appeard between the first two, and then faded away and disappeared. I watched for a while longer as the two objects appeard to stand still hovering. I got up and went upstairs, looked out the window and the first object was gone, the colored was moving away rapidly towards the south, then the first object reappeared, disappeared, and the reappeared again. I wached as it disappeared again, this time in blink it reappeared a large distance east of its origINAL position for a blink and then blinked in again to the north of the second postion. Thus going point to point in a triangle disappearing and reappearing like it teleported almost, and then disappeared altogether, the second object was still moving, and then it two just vanished. 2 - 5 minutes after that, I saw a very high speed jet come through the direct path heading west, like it was in pursuit. Then about 7:30 I noticed more jets in the sky, I thought the where moving through, as they went to the East, then I saw some coming back the other way, thats when I noticed nothing but jet trails from horizon to horizon in parrellell and criss cross patterns. There was a lot o them and they preceeded to do this for about 5 - 6 hours.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

They made no sound.   The first UFO looked to be the size of my thumb nail held out at arms distance and extremely bright white sphere of light followed by 7 elongated triangles.  The triangles were the size of my thumb held at arm's distance and showed depth as the edge of the craft as it was illuminated.  Under the spear shaped triangles were 6 amber colored lights.3 to each side of the triangle.  The first bright shimmering light went over, and then the first triangle.then the second. the third went over and made a sharp maneuver to the right, to the left then backs to the right. The fourth triangle went over, then the fifth, the sixth and when the seventh one went over I said to the witness with me that this was not a flock of birds and at that instant the triangle turned ino a flock of birds in front of our eyes.  The total time of the incident was approximately one minute. My witness has worked 23 years at a major medical facility in the security department and is a trained observer.  I am the daughter of two law enforcement officers. I do not seek out attention for any reason.

At approximately 4:48 PM on January 24, 2007, Wednesday, a total of eight UFO's flew overhead from West to East in the clear sky of Spokane, Washington.  The first that went over was a large (about the size of my thumb nail) and extremely bright spherical light, then 7 elongated triangular flying objects flew over.  The triangles were as long as my thumb (held at arm's distance).  The edges were illuminated and showed depth. There were 6 amber colored lights under each one of the triangles.  There was no sound.  This occurred during the fireworks display for the opening ceremonies of the United States Figure Skating Championship.  The fireworks had just started, perhaps about a minute into the display when up above the arrow head shaped craft flew over following the sphere of extremely bright light.  The first triangle went over, then the second, then the third turned sharply to the left then the right, the fourth one went over, then the fifth, the sixth and when the seventh one went over itchanged shape.  The moment I said to the witness with me that these were not a flock of birds.they transformed to a flock of birds in front of our eyes. Soon after the event, perhaps a minute or two, an unexpected heavy fog set in over the city and above us.

We were in a car, traveling to Fred Meyer's to get some food.  Suddenly a triangle shaped aircraft appeared over the mountains (more like big hills with houses) to our right.  It had 3 lights on the corners (on the bottom), and three on top (but on the same corners), so it appeared to be roughly 1/8 as tall as it was long (But it did look like a solid triangular object).  It also appeared to be pretty far up, and considering that it moved fairly fast.  It originally came over the hills and west straight, perpendicular to the highway, before making a 90 degree right-turn and following the highway.  After that turn, it slowly veered off to the left again, diverging from the path of the highway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was outside at dusk looking south at the star I always see in the southern sky.  Then I saw what I thought was a jet flying from south to the north.  There were strobe lights in a triangular shape.  They were flashing very brightly in a seemingly random pattern.  I waited to hear the roar but as it approached overhead I still could not hear anything.  As it flew overhead it took a very quick and bizzare little jog.   I could see that it was triangular in shape as the sky was not completely dark yet.  I'd have to guess it was 15 to 20 thousand feet up. I dont know nor can I even guess if it was something form earth or not.  Why would an alien craft have strobe lights like that?  Did anyone else see it?  I had a phone camera/video cam in my pocket but I was in too much awe to think to get it out.  PLEASE Peter, could you send me a note if anyone else reports this?

Triangular, flashing lights, possible spycraft;2009-03-06 23:00:00;5 seconds;Triangular, flashing lights, possible spycraft Got out of the car in my parking lot and was walking to my apt. Looked up to see the beautiful night sky which filled with high, puffy clouds that were reflecting the moon and I could see a few stars here and there. My eyes quickly fell upon the typical “spycraft” triangle UFO. I knew it wasn’t a plane, although at first I thought it was because it had flashing lights like one. One light was white, the other red, and the other blue if I remember right. I haven’t a clue how high up it was but it seemed a bit higher than the clouds and seemed small from a distance, and it was moving about as fast as a plane. No engine sounds although that didn’t surprise me at all considering the height it appeared to be at. My assumption it was one of those spyplane things. Why it had flashing, blaring lights though when it’s supposed to be spying is beyond me! But that’s what I think it may have been as we have an Air Force base nearby.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Slow moving triangular object in night sky disapeares into cloud.;2010-11-12 10:48:00;10 seconds;Slow moving triangular object in night sky disapeares into cloud. A slow moving air craft moved in the sky into the clouds, moving at about 20-to-30 miles per hour (that is my best guess) too slow for any man made craft to sustain flight! I watched it for about 10 to 15 seconds. I almost fell off of my front steps to turn my friend around so they could see it too. He did not get as long of look at it as I did, but he too agreed with the shape and speed of the craft.  It was triangular in shape, and almost looked like you could see through the middle of it, like it was transparent, yet I could still see very defined edges of the shape.  There were no lights coming from it, and no sound, yet on the edges of the craft it looked as though there were shapes on it on the outer edge that were square and rectangular shapes that I could make out that didn't look to be in any particular pattern.  The object in a whole had a sheen to it like a metal, yet glass look to it.  When it went into the cloud it disappeared.

I saw four lights in perfect formation at about 60 thousand feet.;2012-04-07 07:40:00;5 minutes;I saw four lights in perfect formation at about 60 thousand feet. At approximately 7:40 am I was sitting in my hot tub facing south-west.  At first I saw one white light traveling way slower than an airplane and even slower than a satellite.  I thought maybe someone had let a balloon loose but it was so high I thought it was doubtful.  I am pretty sure the altitude was twice as high as an airplane flies, so maybe 60,000 feet?  I am a private pilot so I have a little bit of experience with judging altitude, but it is hard to say because of not really knowing what I was looking at. After about 10 seconds I noticed a second and then third light that formed a perfect triangle.  The front light was white and the side lights were red, not solid red, but reddish.  After a few more seconds I saw the fourth and final light.  It was white and trailed the front white light by 3 to 4 times the distance from the front light to either of the red lights.  So what I saw was a perfect triangle of white in front and red on both side and then the trailing light. Why I am intrigued with what I saw is because of the perfect geometry of the shape.  The lights were traveling from south west to north east.  As it turns out I had a perfect view from my hot tub.  The lights travelled directly above my head.  I think it took between 10 and 12 minutes from about 30 degrees from horizon to about 120 degrees of horizon.  I am not sure if that is how you describe it but I am thinking 180 degrees spectrum. I am not sure what I saw, but I have never seen anything like it in the past.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

The sound however was not the sound of an airplane from the nearby airport.  I looked up to the sky to see a small black triangle craft coming down to earth, I panicked and pointed it out to my parents (I'm 23). We did not get a photo graph of the object.   The craft slowly descended down to the sidewalk, the craft was around 4 ft. long and 2 ft. tall. and had green and blue lights all over, the craft also made a few sounds along the lines of boop beep ziiip. The craft hovered in front of me and my parents for a short time before shooting off into the sky. Us 3 are the only witnesses to this event as far as I know. I'm not sure if our dog should count as a witness or not, he did bark at the object a few times, so if you do count as animals as witnesses, it's 4. ((NUFORC Note:  Serious report, or maybe not??

Brightly lit triangle craft hovered 50 feet above roadway Spokane, WA.;2016-11-09 21:30:00;10 minutes;Brightly lit triangle craft hovered 50 feet above roadway Spokane, WA. I was driving home on High Drive around 9:30 pm Wednesday Nov. 9, 2016, after having dinner in downtown Spokane when this incident occurred. I was headed east on High Drive and approaching the intersection of High Drive and Grand Boulevard when I saw this giant incredibly bright object in the sky that was immediately above the treetops about four blocks away. At first, I wasn't sure if it was a panel of stadium lights, but there's no stadium anywhere nearby. I live just a short distance from where this incident occurred, and I have been there thousands of times over the past 17 years, and I have never once seen a light like that anywhere in the neighborhood. I drove toward the object, and pulled over on the south side of East 43rd Avenue, between South Scott and South Garfield Streets. What I saw was a giant triangle that was only 50 feet or so above me, and hovering above some trees in a residential neighborhood. The object appeared to be about 180 feet long (half the distance between Scott Street and Garfield Street on 43rd Avenue) and 90 feet wide. There were white lights all the way around the sides of the triangle, and it was hovering in one place and didn't make any noise. Where I pulled over by the side of the road was almost directly underneath this triangle object, and I could see dark black circles on the underside. I turned my engine off, and watched this triangle object. There was absolutely no noise coming from it. Right after I pulled over, the thing started moving slowly from east to west. I reached in my purse to grab my cell phone so that I could take a picture, and I kept looking back at the triangle when suddenly it took off faster than anything ever seen my life. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen. When the object took off, it went west. It's speed was so fast that had I blinked my eyes, I would've missed it. The entire incident lasted about 10 minutes (9:30 to 9:40 pm). I know this because I had just looked at my dashboard clock as I approached the intersection of High Drive and Grand Boulevard, and I called my mother immediately afterward to tell her what I had seen. If I was to compare the size of the triangle from my perspective it to the size of a full moon, it was dozens if not hundreds of times bigger. If I was to compare the size of the triangle to my clenched fist held at arm's length, it was much, much larger. Although I was alone in my car, I am absolutely certain that there were other witnesses to this incident. When I reached the intersection of Grand Boulevard and High Drive at 9:30 pm, there were several Spokane Police officers standing in the flowerbeds of a private residence and talking to an older gentleman. They were parked in the driveway of the house on the north side of High Drive. They appeared to be looking for something in the flowerbeds adjacent to the roadway at a private home on the south side of High Drive. While I was parked on 43rd Avenue and watching the triangle, another car (vehicle #2) drove by my car. Vehicle #2 was headed east to west on 43rd Ave. and passed directly under this giant lighted triangle. I am absolutely certain the driver of Vehicle #2 saw the triangle, because it was brighter than any light I have ever seen. When I got home, I went to the Spokane News page on Facebook to see if anyone had posted anything about this. The only thing I found was a post about a car accident that occurred at 6 pm that night at the intersection of Grand Boulevard and High Drive. However, was no sign of any vehicle collision at that intersection at 9:30 pm, so I don't think the  triangle object is related to the car accident earlier that evening. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone on two occasions, and she seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sincere.  We strongly suspect that she is a quite capable, and credible, witness.
