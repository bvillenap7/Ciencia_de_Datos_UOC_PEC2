None of the objects were traveling any faster than the others, they stayed in trangular formation until I lost site of them as they approached the horizon of the city lights.  They were traveling from NW to SE. I was sitting in my hot tub looking up at the stars as usual when I saw three objects traveling in triangular formation from the NW sky to the SE.  The objects seemed only to be illuminated from our sun, similar in intensity to a satellite as viewed from earth.  The weird thing is that I have never seen three satellites traveling in formation together. All three of the objects seemed to be the same size.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
formation of 5 or 6 red lights flying over my house;2011-11-15 19:00:00;3-4 seconds;formation of 5 or 6 red lights flying over my house At around 7pm on 11/15/2011 I was standing outside my house while having a cigarrette, not really looking at anything I caught some movement straight up and when I looked up I saw 5 or 6 dim but clearly visible red lights crossing over my head at extremly fast speed, they were in a triangle or boomerang sort of of formation and were visible for about 4 seconds in which they covered a great distance going east to west.  I live near an airport and a AFB and also have planes flying across towards seattle all the time and I would say the distance these objects covered would have taken a commercial airplane probably a minute.  Thats all I really saw, after these about 4 seconds the objects were already too far away to be seen;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
8 lights in formation going north west.;2013-03-08 21:00:00;8-10 seconds;8 lights in formation going north west. well i was stepping out on my porch to have a smoke and i decided to look up to view Orion and a few of the constellations west of my location and as i looked back at Orion I firs seen three lights spinning in formation about 1000 to 4000 feet going about the speed of a f-14 full throttle going north east and after they got as bright as a dimmed led on low battery five more joined and made a u formation but the ones in the middle where still spinning and after the got out of view i seen a fairchild refueler or a 747 heading south west about 30 thousand feet 2 seconds later.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
