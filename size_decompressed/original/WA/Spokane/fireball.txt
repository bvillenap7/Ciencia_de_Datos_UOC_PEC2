A highly brilliant white/blue light appeared south of our position. It was at least 25,000 ft or more above ground when first spotted it dropped several thousand feet dimmened then brightened again then dimmened to a pinpoint light before dissapearing. Most remarkable thing was it's almost total verticle descent. It was not a reentry pattern nor was there a tail as in comet or meteor. The light was the size of a dime as viewed from our location and more than ten times brighter than any landing lights i've ever seen. My background- 22yr retired USAF veteren with more than 10 years experience as a special fuels handler with various black project programs. I know the light configs of almost every military and comercial aircraft including one's the general public has'nt even been made aware of. this object defies any flight pattern i've ever seen and i've seen some strange ones. will try to send map;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

It was flying horizontally straight across the sky. I saw one object that was floresent green with a tail of bright greens and bright yellows.  I was sitting in my living room and I was looking out the sliders.  It was a clear night and the object came from the east.  I got up fast and ran out on to the deck and observed it for about 3 seconds before it kept going west.  I was surprized because it wasn't falling, it was heading west horizontally.  It was so exciting and it was something that I had never before seen in my life! Thank You, ((personal data deleted));47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Fireball above Spokane Airport;2003-09-22 05:15:00;2 seconds;Fireball above Spokane Airport This was not a UFO sighting, but a huge fireball in the sky, close to the ground.  It was the largest meteor I have ever seen (by at least ten times), or it may have been a sattelite.  It appeared out of the left corner of my eye as I was driving in the dark, bright enough to draw my attention away from the road.  It appeared to be directly over Spokane Airport, or possibly to the south of the airport.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
Dozens of free Flying Stars over Spokane on sunny afternoon, taking triangular formations.  White and Red Pulsing.;2005-05-05 16:00:00;30 minutes;Dozens of free Flying Stars over Spokane on sunny afternoon, taking triangular formations.  White and Red Pulsing. I was waiting outside my girlfriends house off of sprague when I looked in the sky and saw dozens of flying objects that looked like stars in the blue clear skys around the afternoon sun.   After ten minutes or so they began to move around slowly at first, and I noticed that some of them were red and blinking while the others looked white and sparkly.   They would take triangular formations and the red stars would take a position in the middle of the triangles.   They would move back and forth, and fly toward the horizon, and accelerate at extremely high speed until disappearing.  Then they would be replaced by others that would return, while often the red pulsing ones would stay still or move slowly.  My girlfriend came outside and I pointed out the stars asking &quotwhy are there stars over spokane in the middle of the day?&quot  She got binoculars, and when we observed them the white sparkly stars were only what looked three red, blue, and green lights, ! together looking white with the naked eye.  They almost looked like the pixel of an old T.V. closeup.  The red ones were just red, and clear blue sky in between pulses as if nothing was there.  Eventually, they all either shot over the horizon with seemingly parabolic acceleration, or strangly flew into the sun until unobservable.  It almost seemed like it new I saw them, since they were not hardly visible or moving at all at first, and as soon as I had binoculars they all slowly dispersed.  Whatever they were, they were definitely coordinating they're movements and seemed to like the triangle formation, although it was not a constant theme as they silently moved where ever they liked.  Also, the red blinking ones seemed to be more stationary as the white ones formed triangles around them.  I reported to the police and the airport, both said call the airforce or one of the others.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
fireball fizzel out and resparks later from same spot;2005-12-16 21:30:00;15 sec;fireball fizzled out and resparks later from same spot December 16, 2005 in downtown Spokane WA @ approximately 9:30 PM??  My Friend, who was a once a military pilot and a POW, and I were traveling west on I-90 and from the Southern sky what appeared to be a meteorite or Fireball traveled in a northwestern direction.  It was huge.  We both spotted it at the same time.  It was bright, changing color yellows, reds, blues, and greens.  It has a tail trailing it like you would expect with a comet.  It lasted a good 6 seconds before it fizzled out but, in the time it takes to say, Did you see that? it suddenly sparked back up from the same spot it was last seen at and continued its course for another 2 or 3 seconds.  We werenâ€™t quite sure what to make of it and thought we would hear something about it somewhere but never did.  Please note it was last seen in the general area of the Spokane International Airport also that of Fairchild Airforce Base.  Something like that had to have been noticed.  In my search to find out what it had been, a friend who had been out visiting on the West Side of Town at the time of the occurrence also mentioned having seen it and had commented that it was really cool.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Spokane River (McCoys Marina):  Red-Yellow Fireball witnessed.;2011-07-03 22:00:00;10-15 Minutes;July 3, 2011 22:00 Spokane River Red/Yellow Fireball above Mccoys Marina NE Washington State A group of people and friends were waiting for a firework show to start, when a fireball appeared across the lake above the treeline.  The object appeared as a yellowish redish light and once appeared just stayed in position for 10-15 minutes.   People starting commenting on the strange light drawing more attention to it.  The object neither got closer or further away it just stayed there on the horizon. We had roughly 10 people in our group, but there where well over 100 people there to watch the fireworks (I didn't ask everyone, but I assume most saw the strange object)   We where there together sitting on the beach facing South West, the object was roughly 35-45 degree's in the air and was about half the size of a full moon.    A full range of thoughts and emotions began through the group questioning the origin and exact nature of the object when the fireworks started.  I would turn my head and watch the fireworks, then turn and look at the fireball (I was half afraid that it was a comet heading straight to my location).   I would watch fireworks, then glance back and forth then, the next time I look, the object had disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and credible.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.

Bright orangish spheres traveling slowly from east to west then ascending until gone.;2011-12-23 16:30:00;30 min;Bright orangish spheres traveling slowly from east to west then ascending until gone. On 12/23/11 at approx. 1630, 3 large fireball like objects were observed by my daughter in the northeast sky above the Hillyard area of Spokane, Wa. As she was driving to my house. When she arrived, I went outside and looked in the sky and observed two bright orange lights, larger than the brightest star visible, basically hovering in the sky above the Beacon Hill of Hillyard. One object was perfectly still in the southern part of the sky while the other object moved slowly and silently from east to west then stopped and went straight up into the sky until it disappeared.  The object to the south remained stationary. Approximately 30 seconds later, another bright orange ball appeared out of the East at what appeared to be a very low altitude and appeared to be heading right towards us. There was absolutely no sound associated with it. People were pulled over in their car and a man came running over to me asking if I was seeing what he was seeing. I grabbed my digital camera and attempted to video the event but could not get anything recorded. I was able to get some still pictures of the last object before it and the object to the south disappeared.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

3 red/orange fireballs moved across the night sky and then disappeared, this happened in Spokane, WA.;2013-06-15 22:30:00;3 minutes;3 red/orange fireballs moved across the night sky and then disappeared, this happened in Spokane, WA. My friend and I were outside in front of our apartment building at 22:30, and I was standing up, she was sitting down in a lawn chair.   I saw two bright fireballs coming in from the east, and they were headed in a west-southwest direction.  They were probably about a 1/4 of a mile above us.   After a few seconds, a third fireball appeared out of nowhere and went in the same direction.  They disappeared into the same place, I mean they just vanished into thin air.   We live on the south hill of Spokane, and it was pretty clear here, no clouds to the east, and very few to the west-southwest.  These things were not going real fast, but maybe about as fast as a small plane would travel when going in for a landing, not very fast.   My friend and I sit outside to smoke during the day and at night, we are both 59 years old and have no reason to make this kind of stuff up.    After looking up sightings, we decided to make a report of the sighting of these 3 fireballs.   The fireballs were red/orange, did not leave a trail behind them and I saw nothing fall to earth when they disappeared.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

Pulled off arterial onto side street to watch it pass overhead.  Saw what appeared to be an orange light approximately 1000 ft above ground travelling in a northeast direction.

Green and red light hovering silently around treeline block away from my house.;2014-08-02 18:05:00;several minutes;Green and red light hovering silently around treeline block away from my house. I was on my patio which faces south of 1800 W Cleveland, the wind was stating to blow a storm was coming in, then a pair of lights came up from the tree a block south, one was green and one was red they looked seperate but had the exact same movement.  First I noticed it come from the south side of the tree, its a bushy tall tree so like 150 feet tall and sits in the back of a vacant home on Grace.  The lights came half the distance closer to my patio at one point, staying at the same height then went back to the other side of the tree and went behind, then it went up real fast like it was propelled.   I'm from England but moved here 12 years ago and have gotten used to heavy airplane and helicopter traffic and this was neither because it was only a block away and didn't hear anything.  It went on for several minutes I thought it was longer but can't remember.   It seems as though it was looking for something in the tree the way it went back and forth and behind it.  The red and green lights were just glowing and basically and nothing else was seen.  I find it hard to describe.;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876

A white center and orange to yellow edges and yellow to white trail which followed about 1/3 of the sky - horizon to horizon - the trailing streak seemed much softer than the usual shooting star and was moving much slower.   I would estimate it at around 10-20,000 ft. ele. and If I had to guess it would have hit the Earth somewhere near Deer Park or Chewelah WA.  The duration was about 4-5 sec.. I have seen something similar in 1974 in Oregon but this one was much more colorful (yellow and orange and floating very slow for a meteor . . . Thanx;47.6727988871224;-117.3898581876
