We were both looking at this are when we both saw a light the size and intensity of an average star wink on for about 1/4 to 1/2 a second and then wink off.  It reminded me of a lightning bug.  We asked each other if we had seen it, and confirmed it.  We kept looking at the same area and saw it again.  I then began counting and found that it winked on in regular cycles of 29-30 seconds.  It slowly moved its way northwest down the sky toward the horizon.  We watched it go toward the horizon for an hour and a half, when we lost it in the glow of northern lights just above the tree tops.  The flashing light grew fainter as it progressed down the sky, until it was visible only by means of my field glasses, which I had run inside to get.  The light was white and had no other color to it. At about 22:30 (or 1/2 hour into the sighting), both my wife and I saw off and to the side of the light we were tracking a second light wink on and wink off, as bright as a bright star.  But it did not continue to blink, just that once.  We kept tracking the original blinking star.;48.5274;-122.2329

The first two flashes were brighter than any star in the sky, and approached the brightness of Mars in the eastern sky.  The object covered approximately 10-15 degrees of sky in about a minute, before the flashes, which grew steadily fainter over time, became invisible to the naked eye.  The time between the flashes was several seconds, and occurred at irregular intervals.;48.5274;-122.2329
