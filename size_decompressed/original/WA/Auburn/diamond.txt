Strange shaped craft over Auburn, WA.;2019-08-19 18:30:00;Few minutes;strange shaped craft over Auburn WA Wife and I were heading to the store when I looked up and saw what I first thought was a hot air balloon.  When I looked again, there was no movement from it, and it stayed stationary for some time.  Took a pic of it and almost looks diamond shaped with two arms, one from top of craft and one from bottom (didn't notice until I looked at picture to see the arms).  Craft was darker in color.  Almost a shiny dark grey.  Then as soon as it was there it was just gone.  No way a hot air balloon could travel that fast.  It wasn't even a windy day today.  Still can't figure out what it was.  Just glad I was able to snap a pic.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
