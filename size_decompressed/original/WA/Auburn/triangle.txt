It had at least 15 lights .  no sound, it was traveling north bound right in the air traffic area of Sea-Tac planes. Trees obstructed our view, by the time we could see it again, it was gone. We have never seen any thing like this before.  My husband , who was in the army/airborne, said he had never seen any thing like it before as well. please let us know if anyone else saw it! I just sent a email to you, I gave you the wrong date!  We saw this on Tues night 05/06/97,  my husband just remembered that the lights were of different sizes, one large very bright light in the center, he also said that he saw what he thought to be a helicopter about 30 sec after we could no longer see the ufo, this helicopter ( non military type, more like a Bell helicopter) was moving very fast, and appeared  to be leaving the area, as fast as it could go!;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

It was going very very slow almost hovering. We were out side lighting fireworks when way up in the sky we saw what looked like a triangular shaped ship.  It had bright blue and red lights and it was moving very slowly.  So slowly that it seemed to be hovering.  My daughter and I saw it.  It was like nothing I had ever seen but my husband thinks it was an airplane.  It was also completely quiet.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

Due to train on track parallel to C St--drove about 10 more seconds until I was able to see the eastern sky again, but it was gone. There was a light on the end of each angle--one red and one green and unsure of 3rd--think it was another red or green, not white or other color. It was so fast--and the low altitude was what drew my attention. There was a lot of traffic, since the train was passing (notoriously long events in Auburn) so people were continuing North on C St instead of waiting at the intersections with train crossings. I had just crossed Main St and saw this plane flying very fast and very very low. I thought it was a plane due to red and green lights--but then I looked after it whizzed by and thought it looked like a triangle shape, with a light on the end of each angle. Because of the train, I couldn't see the eastern sky (the direction it was going) and pulled over just past Del's Farm Supply, at the next intersecion--by then there was nothing to see. I thought it might have been a stealth craft, but it didn't have that swept back look--it seemed more of a true triangle. I couldn't tell if there was any sound, due to a lot of traffic noise, but can usually hear airplanes even above the traffic--we are right on the flight path for Sea-Tac--as low as this seemed to be, I would have thought it would have made a huge noise, but there wasn't anything noticeable but traffic.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Lights in the skies over Auburn, Wa - Changing geometric shapes.;2009-08-24 01:39:00;2 hours;Lights in the skies over Auburn, Wa - Changing geometric shapes At the time of the sighting, two adult males (My son and my nephew) and two adult females (My daughter and myself) were walking outside in Auburn, Washington at 1:39 AM as my daughter was going home next door.  Since we are in a rural location and it was dark out, we were seeing her home safely.  She happened to point out that the stars looked different -  We are all avid sky watchers - and all looked up to consider what she said.  She then said that she had never seen a certain tiny constellation in the Southwestern sky and we all looked to the area she was indicating.  My nephew asked if it had changed shape, and all four of us noted the change from a 'ladle' shape to a square and then a triangle.   Stunned, we watched the shape chnage further into a rounded heart shape, a line, a zig zag, and I told my daughter to get her camera which she had left inside my house. While she was trying to video tape the object, I went into the house, got my camera, and turned all the lights out.  I went back outside and we watched and did our best to document what we were seeing. If the ground were at 0 and directly above us were a 10, the object would have been near the 7. As we stared towards the South South East, the Pleiades was at a 9 and to our left (East).   At arm's length, it would have taken a nickel to cover it. At first we thought the lights were shifting into the repeating shapes, but as we watched over 2 hours, we realized it was a saucer shaped object with the lights along the edge and the ship was rotating, causing the light pattern to shift. The object drifted to the East very slowly, and then drifted back to the West.  We could not judge the size very well, but for some reason we all thought it was huge.   We watched a Sattelite go from the south west to the north east and I would guess that the object was about the same level as it, as the lights were of a similar size.  It could have been smaller and much closer - It was impossible to tell. We also noted several shooting stars, including one that 'shot' slower and did not fade as it curved from the area of the object and went East. We tried very hard to remain calm, but we all felt a sense of awe and gratitude.  We all sent mental messages of  thanks, for what it may have been worth - and we all felt excited and nearly euphoric.  We all agreed that what we were seeing was beautiful. Although we took dozens of pictures and videos, which we will gladly send in if requested, the lights were apparently not strong enough to be picked up by our cameras.  Maybe someone has a program on their computer that can help see what may have been picked up in the videos.  We did enhance one of the pictures and discovered that what we thought was a saucer shape was actually triangular! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we were impressed with her eloquence, and her apparently serious-minded approach to the sighting.  Under ordinary circumstances, we might conjecture that a report of this nature might have been about a sighting of stars in the night.  However, given the exceptionally high quality of the written report, and given the apparent skill of the witness at viewing the night sky, we are impressed by this report.

Three red lights become huge triangle shape over Auburn/Federal Way.;2012-11-27 18:50:00;3-5 minutes;Three red lights become huge triangle shape over Auburn/Federal Way Last night, on the 27th of November, 2012, my adult son called me outside to our backyard, telling me I had to see the weird lights in the sky. I hurried out, looking to the East/ slightly South with two grandchildren, aged 10 and 9.  We all saw three red lights in a line at first.  I would guess that the object was quarter of a mile at most away and very low to the treeline far past our neighbor's rooftop.  We have standard, rambler style homes, and this 'craft', at that distance, was at least half the length of their house.  It appeared to be moving about 45 degrees off the horizon (Can't see the horizon due to trees in the area, so this is a guess) and coasted smooth and silent, no jerky movements. Also, there were shimmerings of red lights that would appear along the 'edge' that faced me, though these were hard to see. The lights pulsed repeatedly, but they looked nothing like anti-collison lights on the aircaft we have seen thousands of times in our area. Within a minute or two, the lights took on a triangular shape that was huge. It seemed to pivot, and turn while slowly lifting the front edge as if it was a single large craft, or if it were several flying in unison, the back ones lifted up.  At any rate, the entire group of lights slipped to the South East and apparently down into the Auburn Valley area. I attempted to record the sighting, but since it was dark, the video from my cellphone doesn't show much. In between the very excited yelling of myself and the elder grandchild, there is a noticable silence.  Any aircraft that we have seen would have shaken the house at such a low altitude and proximity. There is also a report on the MUFON site that almost exactly mirrors ours, case # 44199 from Kent that happened two hous after ours and to the North and East of us.  My son submitted his report last night after we saw it, and the MUFON site had not yet been contacted by the people in Kent that also saw it. It helps to know someone else witnessed this interesting sighting.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Black craft seen over Auburn, WA.;2016-06-28 11:30:00;5 minutes;Black craft seen over Auburn, WA. My wife and I were outside in our backyard in Auburn, WA, today around 11:30AM and while watching a passenger jet go by to the East, we noticed a black triangular object about 1,000 feet in the sky to the North.  It hovered mainly, but seemed to change shapes into other triangular styles.  It never appeared to be moving. I tried to take a video with my Galaxy S7, but the playback showed nothing.  Before we knew it, it was gone.  No sound was noticed.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
