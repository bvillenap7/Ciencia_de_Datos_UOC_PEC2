These objects were whiteish to yellowish in color, at an obvious very high altitude, (I can recall no aircraft flying that high.) My wife brought out a pair of cheap binoculars and I was able to find two of these objects of the same color and just slightly larger size.At about 18:20 two of the objects that were quite some distance from each other started  on a line toward each other at a much increased speed.(Up to this point the objects seremed to be lazily traversing in random courses.)The two objects seemed to swerve at the last moment to pass by closely. At 18:25 the objects dissappeared from my view at which point I went into the house to obtain the UFO reporting telephone number. I returned outside about two minutes later, looked upwards towards a thin whisp of cloud and was greeted with three of these similar objects, closely grouped in the shape of a triangle. Putting the binoculars on this grouping it was cleasrly three of the aforementioned items,spaced closely yet with some distance apart to enable viewing clear sky behind them. It appeared that there was something brown that they were grouped about. About five minutes later the sky was again clear of objects. My wife observed a portion of this but is somewhat lacking in far vision. Do you have any idea what this could have been? We were thinking of a mass release of weather balloons but when the two changed course to close in on each other we began to wonder just what we were looking at ((personal information deleted));47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
7 year old describes red ufo at 4th of July gathering;2009-07-04 22:00:00;3.5 minutes;7 year old describes red ufo at 4th of July gathering 7 year old grand daughter interviewed:  She said that she saw a blue, star-like object first, and that it moved very fast and was high up in the sky, nearly straight up. She said she didn't tell anyone because she got distracted by all the fireworks. She then said that she saw a red, circular 'space ship' that she thought was a balloon at first, but changed her mind when it got closer and she saw that it moved more like a plane, not 'bumping around' and there was no string.  She added that it looked to be made of glass with a bright red light inside it.  She said that she felt scared at first and then happy, and that she did not hear anything unusual.  I asked if it had a happy face on it, and she said it did not. I asked if it flashed at all and she said yes, a lighter red or orange, from the middle.  I asked her if she could see the shape clearly, and she said she could not because the light was bright, but that she felt as it went away In a flat line it seemed to her that it changed and became longer in shape. She indicated that she first saw it coming from the South at about the same level as the commercial planes that go overhead many times a day, but that when it got closer, it seemed lower and closer than a plane. She feels she may have thought it was higher at first but realized it was much lower when it came closer, not that it suddenly dove down.  When it left, she said it rose slightly and went up and to the West before she could no longer see it.  She said that she did not see the light go out, but it faded into the distance and continued to flash in a regular pattern.  She would like to know where it came from *smiles*. So would we.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

From my vantage point it flew over the F.A.A. air traffic control building.  The UFO was was brightly illuminated in white light,and at the center bottom of the UFO appeared to be a warm orange glow.  The warm orange glow was under a vent work, that was not louvered, but a complicated pattern like a snowflake ice crystal pattern.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Hovering lights spotted over Fife, WA.;2016-09-08 22:40:00;10 minutes;Hovering lights spotted over FIFE, WA I would like to begin that I am a former member of the us navy and have a very good eye for aircraft.  Being in the seattle area I am able to identify every aircraft day or night by its light patterns. tonight I was in my work parking lot near the auburn park and ride.  My attention was first brought to a craft which lights were similar to but not consistent with any craft I have seen hovering over the sky about in the airspace of fife, WA.  After just a few moments of watching the solid red, blue, and white lights I noticed there were too many white lights and suddenly the red and white lights were eminating its source outward toward the sky around it.  They were red and white lights almost pulsating and changing direction much like a a police car pulling over a car.  Now I first tried to see whether it was in fact airborne as I live in the valley.  I was hoping that perhaps it was high on a hill, however it was not. After about 5 mins of watching these pulsating lights (which as a result looked as though the craft was elongated or disk shaped) its colors changed to solid white and blinking red like an FAA approved aircraft. It began to move north west in the directing of the olympic pennisula rather that the sea tac airport as I would expect such an aircraft to do. Ill be honest in all of my days observing aircraft day, night, shipboard, on land, and at sea I was frightened and concerned for the aircraft I could see preparing to land at sea tac. It maintained the same altitude while it moved from its hovering position with a slight decent maybe 1 or two degrees which is consistent with a craft going further from view. It was dark, but I have never seen an aircraft emminate that many lights so irradically. I hope that you people can maybe try and find a logical explination for this. Yes I know it was dark, yes there is airtraffic for both lewis/mcchord and seatac however this wasnt any aircraft light pattern I have ever seen. I sho! uld have recorded it however the truth is the resolution would! nt have been ideal at the distance i was from the object. I wish I would have, but i was focused on gathering all information i could to reject the fact it was a ufo.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
