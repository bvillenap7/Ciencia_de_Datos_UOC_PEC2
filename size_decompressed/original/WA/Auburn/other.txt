Tumbling spheres observed with optics that disappeared suddenly in clear sky.;2004-03-08 18:15:00;5 min.;Tumbling spheres observed with optics that disappeared suddenly in clear sky. Slowly rolling group of red, green, and blue perfect spheres observed in the southwestern sky at about a 35-45 deg. angle off the horizon. I was in my yard observing a very nice sunset and noticed a dark shape against the sunset, which was almost over with. The object appeared to be in the flight path of normal air traffic [ there were five or six aircraft on their approach to SEATAC International]. It appeared to be getting closer as if flying towards my location. I ran in and got my 10 x50 binoculars and my 30x60 spotting scope and  veiwed the object for a couple of minutes. Looking through my spotting scope the object was tumbling at about 5000 ft. alt. At first I thought that it was a balloon, but  then there was nothing tethered from it, and the spheres looked too uniform and brightly colored [it was back-lit by the western sunset]. It looked like it was comprised of 6 to 8 red, green and blue balls in a perfect cluster shaped something like this: 0880. I had to move my spotting scope that  was on the hood of my pickup because the object had moved  slowly behind a street light pole in my driveway while I was looking at it. I moved the scope and tried to reaquire the object but couldn't find it. Only ten seconds lapsed before I picked up my wide angle binoculars and tried to find it once more. The object had completely disappeared. I search for it for another 10 minutes and gave up. The things that stood out most in my memory was the perfect  almost molecular shape and the distribution of the most purest glossy colors I have ever seen in backlight.

My initial words from my mouth were what ((is that)), and I usually do not swear so I watched it slowly fly towards the horizon still not sure if it was a plane but I had never seen the red lights on a plane look quite like that and the way or order they flashed I had never seen before either and how it just appeared where there was no cloud it flew I would guess about 10 to 15 miles out away from me then turned right and appeared to sort of get closer like it came back a few miles then all of the sudden I am watching it intensely when out of the corner of my left eye was a bright round light that also appeared from no clouded spot in the sky and I immediately thought wow I have never seen a light that round and bright ever in the night sky it moved the other direction and appeared to just get smaller rea! l fast till it looked like a little star in the sky and then disappeared    I looked back to see the other plane or craft that I first saw and it was no longer visible so kinda freaked out I went straight to my computer to see if anyone else had saw it and reported it but I could not find anything so today I found this place to report it in hopes that anyone else saw it and im just not seeing things         signed  child of GOD ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

3 bright flashes with the second being the longest followed by a helicopter(s) rounding where I live.

This has happened more than once.   A few months back my neighbor and I were on my front porch, when a hang-glider shaped silent craft that looked like it had some cloaking device soared right above us at 50' and then it was followed by 7 helicopters that showed up 5-10 minutes after we were freaking out about what we had just witnessed.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
I witnessed an odd object in the sky over Auburn.  As I watched the first, and others appeared over the west hill. ((anonymous report));2018-12-07 10:20:00;10 minutes;Last night, I witnessed an odd object in the sky over Auburn.  As I watched the first, and others appeared on/over the west hill, following the same basic path,  I realized what I was seeing.  These where do it yourself Balloons and had an obvious fire in them.  Over a ten minute period, four were launched from the Auburn West hill and climbed in the cold air from west to east then seemed to move south as they gained altitude.  They all eventually faded (flamed) out. Each behaving as the one prior. Someone was having some fun. I have video but not worth sharing.  These were bags with a fire in them.  They were launched from approximately 32 Street and west valley highway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
