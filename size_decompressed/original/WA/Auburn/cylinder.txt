After a few short seconds I realized it was not a firework as it got closer and brighter.   At the same time myself and my friend both said what is that and pointed.  Neither one of us even realized the other had been watching the object.  We all walked to the south end of the back yard to get a closer look.  It was a very bright red/orange object that appeared to glow. It did not blink like lights from a plane it just glowed.  Pictures were taken by one of the people present. It had started it's course by coming from the south to the north but then slowly changed course and made a turn going southwest.  We kept watching it until it was out of sight.  There was no noise coming from this object like an engine.  It was very quiet.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

At first looked like a plane and then, as we watched, it seemed to turn around  and the colors were red green and white.   Than all the sudden it seemed to be backing away and is only a dot in the sky.   WE have seen this 3 other times in the last month.    What is it? ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius?

Airport, I have a clear view of the air traffic from my condo,  I think they were possible below the air liners, they didn't make any sound above the sound of the airliners they were very clear & seemed closer then the airliners, I have lived here almost 12 yrs., have seen all types of commercial & military & medavac planes from my 2nd.  Floor deck, these were not even close to anything I have ever seen before, or such a large group,  I am still shaken about what I saw & not getting confirmation of this, live alone am very open-minded, have read many considered at one time controversial books many yrs ago & still shocked by this!;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
