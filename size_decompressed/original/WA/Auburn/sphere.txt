Bright green ball of light on highway 167;1990-10-15 21:30:00;5 sec;Bright green ball of light on highway 167 I was driving back from my girl friends house driving south on highway 167 between Kent and auburn. While driving I just happened to notice that there were no other cars on the highway going north or south except me. There were no lights on the road nor any house lights on either side of 167 because it was mostly farmland and pastures.  Then all of a sudden I saw this bright green sphere shoot down in my vision.  It was right in front of my truck. I could not tell how far away it was but in my view it seemed to be about the size of a quarter.  It was really bright green, almost fluorescent colored.  Its shape had a band that wrapped around it like a tootsie roll lolly pop. It stayed the same shape as I continued to drive.  I was going about 60 mph. I quickly looked around to see if there were any type of vehicles or lights coming from the side or anything that could explain this.  But there was nothing remotely similar to this object.  Then as fast as I saw this object it took off into the sky almost straight up in a split second.  I tried to track it but it was too fast.  After that I started to see vehicles on the highway going north as though there was a break in the regular traffic.  Then vehicles  heading south appeared in my rear view mirror.  It was almost like I was the only one who was allowed to witness this object.  I never told anybody about this until a few months later. After that I started having dreams of something chasing me. The dreams lasted for several weeks then stopped.  I haven't seen anything like that again or have had dreams of being chased.

Heard airplane, looked up and saw silver sphere.;1998-05-06 13:30:00;12 minutes;Heard airplane, looked up and saw silver sphere. I was playing golf at the Auburn public course, with a co-worker and another twosome.  I do not recall the names of the other two.  The sky was high and clear.  We had not heard, or at least had not taken note of, an airplane all day.  While waiting to tee off on the 16th hole, our conversation was interrupted by the loud noise of airplane engines. We all looked up to see if the plane was in trouble.  It was a DC-9. The plane was about 5000 feet(guess) climbing and banking hard left to the ENE.  I was studying the silver ball, that the plane seemed to be trying to avoid, when my co-worker said, Hey!  There's a UFO!.  The object was perfectly round, bright silver, and its diameter was about 1/4 of the length of the fuselage of the aircraft.  The object was moving very slowly toward the nose of the plane.  The plane missed the ball by approximately half a mile and flew away safely.  None of us noted the carrier's name.  The ball did not follow. It changed direction to E, increased altitude.  We assured each other that we all saw it. We played on, checking it every few minutes.  It continued to move slowly to the E. After several minutes, we lost track of it.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
4th of July - Red/Orange UFO with bright pusling light - Auburn, Washington  - 12 witnesses;2009-07-04 20:01:00;3+ minutes;4th of July - Red/Orange UFO with bright pusling light - Auburn, Washington  - 12 witnesses While shooting fireworks at our home on the 4th of July, 2009, at around 10:00 PM, two of 12 adults noticed a reddish light moving slowly in the sky.  I called out for the others to look and my friend yelled for everyone to stop lighting fireworks and look. We all moved toward or fence, staring to the South as the craft grew larger. It was like a rounded square shape or sphere, a beautiful reddish orange color with a single bright pulse of amber light every 2 -3 seconds. It had no anti-collision lights and did not look like any conventional craft any of us had ever seen, and it was not a firework. Two of the adults are ex-military and very familiar with military craft. They both stated that what we were watching was not a plane or helicopter or any other conventional craft. The object moved slowly, with a slow, pulsing strobe of bright gold that would flash and light the center of it.  I believe it was about 1/4 to 1/3 mile away.  It was traveling North towards us and curved gently toward the West as it disappeared in a smooth flight. It seemed that the center was darker than the rest of the ship until the light pulsed, and as it traveled, it went from a reddish color to an orange - the object appeared to be lit from inside - Like a frosted glass shade on a lamp. There were 12 adults, most of us non-drinkers, and 3 children that all watched. We had been watching fireworks in the distance to the South and were alerted by the fact that unlike the fireworks that had been going on all around the neighborhood, this object was moving horizontally, did not explode, made no sound, and made a slow arc towards the West before it got so far away we could not see it. We all felt different - confusion, amazement, and fear -A few of us were excited and almost euphoric - Feeling lucky to see it. We all discussed the object as it flew in the sky, ruling out every flying craft we could think of as we watched it. We lost sight of it when it flew out of sight.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
15 witnesses saw red lights at night over Auburn, Washington on 7/4/2011 - Not fireworks or lanterns.;2011-07-04 22:00:00;45 minutes;15 witnesses saw red lights at night over Auburn, Washington on 7/4/2011 - Not fireworks or lanterns. On the 4th of July, 2011, 15 people witnessed aprox. 12 different red/orange balls of light moving from east to west around 10:00 PM.  The spheres continued to show up for about 45 minutes. Most of the witnesses are non-drinkers and were very alert,  Thinking at first that they were 'Chinese lanterns', only a couple of pictures were attempted.  While watching carefully, it was later decided that perhaps they were something unusual.   A similar sighting was noted in 2009 of a single object on that Fourth of July, and it was also reported. On the 4th this year, it was a warm night, little to no wind, fireworks going off everywhere.  Some of us are familiar with various human made craft, and have seen 'chinese lanterns' in flight.  This was purposeful and did not flicker or move in an erratic way.  One group of five or six contained four spheres that were very close together in two sets of two.  These broke apart and coninued to soar in a shape similar to the markings on dice -  Like the '6' with one dot on the top missing.  The sixth sphere winked out and lit up again as they traveled to the west.  The shape became similar to the Big Dipper, but the movement was smooth and did not appear random. The objects came from the east, but at different points along the horizon.  Some were farther away, most were 'BB' sized or smaller. One of the objects was observed for at least four minutes -  It crossed under the flight path of a commercial airplane as the plane was starting to descend towards SeaTac Airport.  The plane was aproximately twice as high as the object, and the object was aprox. 100 feet above the tops of mature alder and evergreen trees.  The object did not flicker but seemed to pulse a beautiful orange color. It did not veer in any way but stayed in a straight path at the same altitude, speed was relatively slow.  At the closest point, it was slightly smaller than a wooden pencil eraser and was coming from the east, and it continued to glow as it disappeared into the distance to the west.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
I was standing outside taking my smoke break at 9:45 pm Sunday night May 5, 2013 in the North side of town in Auburn, Washington.;2013-05-05 22:00:00;20 minutes;I was standing outside taking my smoke break at 9:45 pm Sunday night, May 5, 2013 in the North side of town in Auburn, Washington.  I was looking up at the sky facing to the NE I saw an object that looked like a satellite moving across the sky.  I then noticed a spherical object following the less brighter object it was powering up and down as it was following the other object, they were both moving from East to West.  I estimate they were pretty high up mile wise because where my job is at in North Auburn you can see all the plane's coming in on their flight path to Sea Tac airport. While I watched these two object's they faded in and out a couple of times.   As they moved from East to West I saw the front sphere move in a horizontal direction move toward the ground very quickly then shoot straight up back up just as fast as it disappeared out of sight the brighter sphere was still moving towards the East still pulsing then just faded out.  I stood there for a min! ute and was going to go back inside when I noticed another bright sphere coming from the South this one moved a bit faster than the other two objects.  This new object moved from South to North.  As i watched this next sphere it pulsed also as it moved across the sky it faded in and out just like the other two. This new sphere grew really bright as it headed North then there was large flash and it was gone.   The whole time you could see aircraft coming in for landing at Sea Tac airport. I am ex military and trained in vehicle identity what I witnessed was incredible never seen anything like this before.   All this happened between 9:45 PM to 10:00 PM.  I saw these objects very clearly for there were no clouds in the sky that night.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
White glowing sphere slowly travels across night sky, hovers a minute then ascends up through clouds;2013-07-12 23:35:00;8 minutes;White glowing sphere slowly travels across night sky, hovers a minute then ascends up through clouds After a hot day, it was still very warm late into the night. Around 11:30 pm my 14 year old grandson wanted a soda from the convenience store a couple blocks away.  We walked to the store and while I waited outside for him I noticed what I first thought was probably a plane about a mile or so away, traveling west towards me in the night sky.  But as it got a little closer I realized it had no blinking airplane lights and seemed to be traveling slower than most planes I’ve observed coming into the Auburn airport, plus it wasn’t in the normal flight path for the airport.   Then after a few more minutes it was maybe a half mile away and appeared to look more like a illuminated sphere shaped object.  My grandson came out of the store and I pointed it out to him.  As we walked east down an ally just off E main street towards G street SE we watch it come closer until it was almost directly above us. It was a silent, whitish glowing sphere about  10 - 20 feet in diameter and 250 feet high (just below a patch of clouds creeping by).   Then we heard the sound of a commercial jetliner and  within seconds we saw it traveling northeast directly towards the object but  well above it.  As the jetliner entered the clouds and passed over the sphere object, the object suddenly stopped and hovered for about one minute and then slowly ascended straight upwards through the clouds and out of site.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Round white/metallic sphere.;2017-06-25 14:00:00;10 minutes;Round white/metallic sphere. White orb hovering and moving slowly above Auburn, WA. Lea Hill area.  At times it looked like bright chrome.  Photos revealed that it appeared to be doughnut shaped with hole in center. Sent from my iPhone ((NUFORC Note:  Photo forwarded by source of report appears to indicate a light-colored object, which is shaped somewhat like a donut, i.e. with a hole in the center of it.  We have corrected the date above.  PD));47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Daytime sighting with short video.;2018-11-18 10:45:00;90 seconds;Daytime sighting with short video. 	I was driving from Kent, Washington to Tacoma, Washington at about 10:45 in the morning.  I was headed south on highway 167.  I looked up into the sky to look at the clouds and I saw an airplane.  As I watched the plane, a silver sphere streaked into view traveling nearly the same direction I was (north to south).   The sphere was moving at a very high velocity, faster than a fighter jet.  As it approached the plane, it came to a complete stop.  Light was reflecting differently off of this object compared to the plane, which can be seen in the video.  At this point I had my cell phone out and began recording.  I did not record the object as it left, but I did see it as it left.  It remained stationary for around 10 seconds before shooting off to the east at the same speed it had originally approached.  It accelerated instantly.  I put my phone down and continued driving.  Around a minute later, two more objects, identical to the original appeared from the s! ame direction the first had come (north to south).  As they hit the spot where the first sphere had stopped, these two made a right angle turn at a ridiculous speed.  They did not bank, just changed direction and headed east.  I did not get video of the second set of objects as I was driving on the highway and could not safely film them.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
