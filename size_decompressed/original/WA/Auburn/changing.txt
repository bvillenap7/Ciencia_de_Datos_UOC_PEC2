Reflective surface, red lights, changing shape.;2012-11-26 18:43:00;~3 minutes;reflective surface, red lights, changing shape I had been outside when I saw some lights up in the sky, travelling approximately to the East by Southeast.  It had continued that way for the duration of our sighting, and was moving much slower than a commercial plane.  At first I thought it was simply a plane, but multiple things stuck out to me about it.  There were three dark red lights, with gaps in between to make the entire thing too wide to be a normal aircraft. Length-wise the entire craft appeared to be as long as my hand, about a half mile away.  The lights were all moving in the same direction, same angle. From my perspective though they didn't shift at first. I had gotten a few other people and when they came out the lights had formed a triangle,  What really concerned me was how reflective it appeared to be. The lights had appeared to reflect across the entire length of it.  The lights shimmered and gleamed across like oil on plastic, or something similar to a camouflage pattern.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
