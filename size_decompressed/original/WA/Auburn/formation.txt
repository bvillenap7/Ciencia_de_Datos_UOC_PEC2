3 sets of 2-4 objects flying in formation that were a semi-rectangular shape with a hazy aura around them as if entering the atmosphere;2001-11-17 22:30:00;5 minutes;3 sets of 2-4 objects flying in formation that were a semi-rectangular shape with a hazy aura around them as if entering the atmosphere I work in the Auburn Washington area and taking periodic breaks to run outside and see if I could spot any of the expected meteors from the Leonid shower. It was really early so I would have been surprised to see anything but a few sporadic meteors. My real excitement happened around 10:30! There were 3 sets in all and showed up approximately 1-2 minutes apart.  The first set, there were 3 in this first set (if i recall correctly), was travelling from south to north, from approximately the Cetus constellation through perhaps as far as the tail of Draco before fading out as if they had entered the atmosphere.  They did not burn out or burst like a meteor might, the just faded.  I was looking straight up from my location and facing east.  If I had to guess at a speed, they were moving at somewhere over 3 times the speed of sound, but nowhere near the speed of what you'd expect a meteor to travel at, and being a poor judge of speeds that high I could be way off.  They were in formation and did not appear to move apart or together.  I saw 2 more sets that were approximately the same in charateristics.  They were in formation, and they were at the same speed.  The 2nd set contained 4, and the 3rd set contained 2.  There may have been more, but thinking this was part of the meteor shower, and very different than any other I'd ever seen, I ran inside to grab the nearest co-worker to let them know that the meteors were really cool looking!  We were back outside within 3 minutes, but no other appearances were made by these odd objects that I saw. The easiest description I could give of these objects were that they looked like the effects given to photon torpedos...ya, like in star trek! The had a hazy redish-orange effect while they were seemingly entering the earth's atomsphere.  The shape that I recall was semi-rectangular maybe a 1x3 or 1x4 ratio.  Other than that, I couldn't make out any other specific traits about them. Like I said, these...things....were definitely NOT meteors!  I saw them all within about a 3 or 4 minute period and at around 10:30pm.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
3 Lights Flashing in Auburn, Washington;2009-06-09 12:05:00;20 SECONDS;3 Lights Flashing in Auburn, Washington I was on the phone and stepped outside for a smoke.  I looked up to see if any stars were out, and noticed a bright light.  The light was steady, and not moving from the spot I first noticed it, and began to flash.  At first I thought it was a plane, since we have the airport nearby, but this light was simply not moving.  I don't believe it was a plane.  After about 5 seconds of flashing, the light disappeared.  Seconds later, two other lights appeared, roughly 3 finger's width apart (and to the left) from where the previous one appeared.  These two traveled slowly in formation (one in front of the other) for roughly 10 seconds.  The first one then slowly cut off it's lights, followed shortly thereafter by the one behind it.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Two formations of bright objects (13 in total) flying from East to West over the Auburn Valley, in WA.;2016-02-23 18:55:00;~5 minutes;Two formations of bright objects (13 in total) flying from East to West over the Auburn Valley, in WA At approximately 18:50 in the night sky above my home, moving from East to West appeared a formation of 3 bright objects moving at a steady speed across the sky. I ran inside and upstairs in order to view this formation above the valley from a West-facing window in my home.  The formation was clearly visible and still moving West at a steady speed. Suddenly, from the East appeared a huge formation of 10 additional bright objects heading in the same Westerly direction at the same speed.  These were in a distinct formation, and I was able to photograph this second formation with my iPhone as well as take a short video. The lead object was out in front of the second formation by a considerable distance.  There were 8 bright objects in a pattern.  The photo I took shows that this could also potentially be 2 formations:  One formation of 4 objects in a backwards “C” formation, and a second formation in a distinct triangle formation. Under this single cluster of 8 objects was the 10th object which was slightly brighter and moving in the same direction and speed as all of the other objects. Both the first and second formation vanished into the distance to the West.  Both formation never changed speed, shape, or direction at anytime.  It was a very deliberate path and speed. I have been a life-long amateur astronomer and know that these were not meteors, fireballs, or bolides based on my observations.  I am also familiar with what a satellite looks like as it breaks apart re-entering the Earth's atmosphere, and this looked nothing like this.  These were brighter than the visible objects in the night sky with a brightness between Jupiter and Venus on a clear night. According to the NWS data for last night, the wind speeds in the area were averaging 9.6 miles per hour, and the wind direction was East...therefore, it was in the opposite direction these objects were flying. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be a quite capable, and serious-minded person.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally reliable, and capable, observer.  PD));47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
