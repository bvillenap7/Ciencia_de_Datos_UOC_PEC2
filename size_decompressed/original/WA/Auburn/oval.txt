Craft appears over Auburn,WA. then speeds away as quickly as it came.;2000-06-01 01:00:00;25 seconds;Craft appears over Auburn,WA. then speeds away as quickly as it came. A friend and I were walking through a park behind Big Daddys Drive-In in Auburn, Wa.  We sat on a picnic table for awhile then walked back towards the direction we came on the path.  We were facing mostly East in direction.  Suddenly in the sky above there was a flash of brilliant dark blue, dark purple, then dark red.  Within that flash of changing color appeared an oval shaped small craft.  The craft had no wings and made no sound.  It was so close above us approximately 400 feet.  It sat motionless.  You could almost make out the metallic like reflections as a set of blinking lights encircled the craft.  Then, without a sound it shot some 1000 yards away from us towards the south east. Stopping instantly, then it shot into the distance and out of sight to the east.  We then stared at each other in disbelief and began to laugh at the incredibleness of it all.

red oval ufo over Auburn Washington that was not conventinal aircraft;2009-07-04 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;red oval ufo over Auburn Washington that was not conventinal aircraft I was standing on my patio near my wife.  I heard my wife and a friend telling us What is That? and I looked up and saw an oval shaped, red thing in the air.  Definitely not an airplane, missile, or satellite. It was going 150 mph approximately which is pretty slow for something in the air. It was glowing as it headed from the South East to the West.  It was not floating, it was moving.  I have nothing to compare it to because it looked so different. I have seen fighter jets at night with their afterburners on, helicopters, commercial, private, and military planes, vintage war birds, blimps, kites, sky divers, and this was nothing like them in any way.   It was silent and it became lighter as it went along its horizontal path.  It continued in a curve, slightly changing direction and upwards at a shallow angle before it flew out of sight. The whole sighting made me feel a bit confused. I do not remember it flashing but heard some of the others saying it did.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Drone footage of impossible fast moving object.;2021-05-03 13:00:00;2 seconds;Drone footage of impossible fast moving object. I did not notice the object until I reviewed the videos that I had collected on the sd card in my drone. I was flying my DJI drone over the green belt behind my house when my low battery indicator came on so I lowered the gimbal to look straight down while descending to the takeoff point. The drone was at 300 ft when it captured the fast moving object that looks like white slightly stretched ball although that could be motion blur. The object is only visible in three frames of the 30 FPS I was shooting in. The object is moving much faster then any bird or insect I have captured in hd. I recently watched a show called contact on the discovery network witch aired a segment of a very similar incident. A drone pilot was capturing b roll when he also captures a fast moving object. He also noticed it later when reviewing the vid. I believe have the same thing stored on my laptop and sd card.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
