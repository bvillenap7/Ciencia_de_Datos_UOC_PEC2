Cross shaped craft over highway 18.;2011-08-09 08:30:00;30 seconds;Cross shaped craft over highway 18 I was driving down I-167 when as I came across the interchange for Highway 18 W I noticed a cross shaped craft in the sky with arrogated jet streams coming off of all for points in a kind of swirl, as if it were spinning or arcing slightly.   My radio became fuzzy and my phone activated it's location positioning without any apps running to start it.  I would grabbed it for a photo but was also being followed by a cop.  The craft then went to disappear behind a small cloud at which point there was no shadow cast and no outline visible behind it. The craft did not come out from behind the cloud and once the cloud was far less visible my radio began working again, my phones tracking system shut off.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
