OBJECT SIGHTED NEAR CHEMTRAILS AGAIN;2000-12-04 14:30:00;2-3 SECONDS;OBJECT SIGHTED NEAR CHEMTRAILS AGAIN ((NUFORC Note:  We are aware that the chemtrail phenomenon has attracted a great deal of attention by some media commentators, but we have seen no convincing data that they, in fact, are a genuine phenomenon.  We strongly believe that people are seeing, and reporting, typical contrails behind aircraft at high altitude.  Also, some aircraft are not painted, so their skin appears metallic.   PD)) I WORK AT THE BOEING PLANT IN AUBURN. I WAS WALKING IN THE GATE AND NOTICING THAT THERE WERE CHEMTRAILS ALL OVER THE SKY. I ALSO NOTICED A PLANE COMMING IN MY DIRECTION AND HEADING SOUTH LEAVING A CHEMTRAIL. ONE CHEMTRAIL PASSED RIGHT OVER OUR BUILDING. I REMEMBERED BY READING SOME ITEMS THAT PEOPLE WROTE THAT SPECIFIED SEEING UFOS AROUND AIRCRAFT THAT WERE SPRAYING CHEMTRAILS. SO WHILE WALKING OUTSIDE AS I USUALLY DO ON A NICE DAY, I LOOKED UP-  I WAS TARGETING CLOUDS AFTER THE DISPERSAL OF THE CHEMTRAIL AND ANY CLOUDS NEARBY. ABOUT 20 OR 30 MILES TO THE LEFT OF THE CHEMPLANE I SAW WHAT WAS AT FIRST A PLANE. IT FLEW SLOW LIKE A PLANE AND NO OTHER CHARACTERISTICS THAN THAT OF A PLANE. IT WAS QUITE FAR AWAY TO IDENTIFY A PARTICULAR SHAPE THOUGH I COULD QUITE TELL IT WAS METALLIC AND SAW NO MEANS OF PROPULSION OR EXHAUST. IT WAS BASICALLY POPPING FROM ONE CLOUD TO ANOTHER UNDER COVER BUT ONLY ONE BASIC SPEED WHICH WAS SLOW LIKE A PLANE. THE ONLY REASON I AM REPORTING THIS IS BECAUSE IT WAS METALLIC AND AS I KNOW AFTER WORKING AT BOEING 19 YEARS AT MOST OF THE LOCATIONS, I KNOW PLANES ARE PAINTED AND ALMOST NEVER LEFT METALLIC. I DIDN'T SEE ANY WINGS EITHER LIKE I SHOULD, BUT WAS A WAYS AWAY. AFTER THE SECOND SIGHTING OF THE OBJECT GOING FROM ONE CLOUD TO THE OTHER, IT NEVER RESURFACED, AND WENT ON IN TO WORK. THIS WAS YESTERDAY AND I NOTICED A BUNCH OF CHEMTRAILS OUT AGAIN TODAY BUT NO OBJECTS. I HEARD NO SOUND BUT DIDN'T HEAR THE CHEMPLANES EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE SO HIGH- I HAVE NEVER SEEN A UFO, BUT HAVE A KEEN INTEREST JUST THE SAME.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Sonic-Booms rattle Windows in Auburn;2001-09-05 12:58:00;2 min.;Sonic-Booms rattle Windows in Auburn At approx. 12:58 this day, an apparent Sonic-Boom was heard which rattled the windows of our home in Auburn, Washington.  This was a familiar sound as I have heard a Sonic-Boom many times before the characteristic Boom, followed roughly 1 sec. later with another Boom.  I went to my mothers bedroom to see if she dropped something on the floor.  She said no but had heard the noise.  While we were talking, there was another Boom, though with roughly twice the energy and only a single Boom!  That one really rattled the windows!! I turned on the Scanner to see if any thing was reported to the local authorities-nothing.  I got on the Web and checked several sites that have instant reports of quakes and the such-nothing.  While on the Web, there was another Sonic-Boom (characteristic again) at 13:35 hours, local time.  Again, the windows really rattled! What is really interesting, was at 13:45 hours, the National Emergency Radio System was activated--(Nation Wide).  The Notice stated this was a planned event and was in effect until 14:00 hours local time. During the duration of this incident, the sky was completely overcast with visibility of approx. 10 miles, No other aircraft were seen or heard. If this was a coincidence, I find it to be VERY interesting! I wonder if other reports were received with regards to this incident. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he seemed very sincere and credible.  We contacted the FAA ARTCC in Auburn, WA, and they confirmed that one of their employees had heard the explosion, but did not know what it was.  The Public Affairs Officer from McChord AFB reported that no known aircraft were flying at supersonic speeds at the time, and that the only explosions in the area were caused by ordnance on Ft. Lewis, located near McChord, but a long way from Auburn.  We do not know what caused the event.  PD));47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Orange light seen over South King Co Wa,;2009-09-14 22:30:00;:01;Orange light seen over South King Co Wa, Looking S by SW noticed a bright orange light stationary for aprox 1 min with another smaller light coming toward it from the east. It looked like 10miles out from my location but near overhead Federal way, Wa, near the flight path to Seatac Airport. light seemed to fade away with only moving slightly to the west for several seconds.

Two low flying craft flying very slowly over HWY 167 southbound, one with two white blinking lights second two green lights.;2009-12-06 01:10:00;3 min.;Two low flying craft flying very slowly over HWY 167 southbound, one with two white blinking lights second two green lights In  the early morning hour of approximately 0110 on December  6th 2009 I was traveling northbound on interstate 167  just  north of highway 18 when I saw the first of two low flying lighted objects both appearing to be stationary over the interstate  at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet. The first object or lights appeared to be a couple miles ahead of me and my view consisted of two unusually large and bright white lights beside each other, index finger at arm length barely covered it. My first thought was that I was seeing lights on top of a tower in the distance because the two lights were blinking one then the other at a slow pace and were brighter than I have ever viewed on an aircraft. As I got closer, within one quarter of mile I realized that there was nothing underneath the lights. The lights were intensely bright still slowly flashing in the same pattern. I eventually drove directly under the lights and was unable to make out the shape of the object in the darkness but did notice smaller flashing lights underneath the two bright lights. The lights under the object were flashing much faster and appeared to be different colors, red, green and white. The lights all appeared to be stationary. The second object or lights were approximately one quarter of a mile farther as I continued northbound on interstate 167.  Just as the first object or lights initially appeared as two very large bright lights side by side so did the second with exception that the two lights were not blinking at any time and were bright green.  The green lights appeared to be stationary over the interstate at the same altitude as the first.  As I continued northbound I eventually drove under it and again noticed smaller quickly flashing colored light beneath this one and was unable again to discern the actual shape of the abject.  As I was about to drive under it my car was approached by two other cars that came from behind me and both sped past as if they had not even seen the very large low flying intensely bright green lights which I found very odd as the lights were so brilliant I found it hard to look away and had slowed my rate of speed to continue watching them. After passing the second object or lights I decided to take the next exit which was the first exit in Tukwila in an attempt to take a front road that I noticed back to view the lights approximately a minute or so later and realized that I could no longer see either of them anymore. There were simply no lights of any kind to be seen at this point. ((NUFORC Note:  The person who submitted this report is well known to NUFORC, and we know her to be a highly reliable source of accurate information.  We do not know what she witnessed, but we strongly suspect that the facts outlined above are quite accurate.  We spoke via telephone with the witness, during which she underscored the dramatic nature of the sighting.  PD));47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

White light streaks across sky and then makes a sharp U-turn.;2012-04-13 22:05:00;5 seconds;White light streaks across sky and then makes a sharp U-turn. The first one I seen came from what appeared to be around Capela and traveled towards the star Alnilam and made a U-turn just to the left of Alnilam and then shot back towards the north.  Then within seconds after that, another one came from the north, this time I didn't see from where though, and passed in front of Alnilam and headed south but it shot up too high and I lost track right after. The third one was approximately 10:27 and came from the south and headed north.  This one was higher in the sky, more on top of Orion.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Star like light on clear sunny day moving north to south changing from bright to almost invisible repeatedly.;2013-09-11 17:15:00;15 minutes;Star like light on clear sunny day moving north to south changing from bright to almost invisible repeatedly. On 9/11/13 around 5:15 it was very sunny and totally clear outside.  I was out on my back porch relaxing after work when I noticed a light that looked like a star almost straight overhead. I was facing NE with the sun behind me.  I got my wife and a friend outside to check it out.  We all watched it for about 15 minutes before we had to leave.  During that time the object seemed to be shining bright then slowly dim to almost invisible and then back to shiny repeated the whole time we watched it.  The light looked like a big sun reflection off of the object to me as if something was slowly spinning or turning in circles.  It moved very slow from north to south then turned and headed west.  Although very slow the speed did not seem to be constant.  I did pull out my binoculars but all it did was make the star like object look a little bigger.  The pics I took just look like bright blue sky.  I am skeptical but know I saw something I have never seen before.  I was researching to see if anyone in the area saw what I saw when I found this website.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

This time, the helicopter was hovering close to the top of our home and weird melody sounds like nothing I've heard before were playing near by.  The sound was music like, but very different.   The sound did not follow any usual note pattern or beat.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Three low hovering orange lights, two seemed to be connected I'm not entirely sure.

It was dark and I couldn't make out a certain shape.  They seemed to be moving slowly in the direction away from me.  Somehow they disappeared over the horizon in a few seconds despite how slow they appeared to me moving.  A plane flew by shortly after and if they lights were connected (wing to wing or just side to side) it would have been three times the size of the plane.

Object moving into wind reflects sunlight.;2018-03-24 19:02:00;60 seconds;Object moving into wind reflects sunlight. Observing the sky I noted what I first thought to be a large bird traveling at  moderate speed in a westerly direction.  As the object was headed west, a commercial aircraft was leaving KSEA (SeaTac) on a southern flight path.  I attempted to point out the bird to a friend who did not locate it.  At that point it was rather small in the sky and was basically a dark object.  The sun was low to the SW.  I noted a very bright reflection that seemed much large in scale then the sizeof the object.  I can completely rule out an aircraft, as the direction of flight would have been an airspace violation.  Once I witnessed the unexpected shimmer, I lost sight of it. I estimate that the object traveled from the Auburn valley to I-5 in less than 60 seconds. There was a distinct cloud ceiling, which is was under.  Conditions at KSEA are as follows:  Conditions at:	KSEA (SEATTLE/METRO , WA, US) observed 0153 UTC 25 March 2018 Temperature:	  7.2°C (45°F) Winds:	  from the WSW (250 degrees) at 6 MPH (5 knots 2.6 m/s) Visibility:	  10 or more miles (16+ km)  Ceiling:	  12000 feet AGL  Clouds:  	few clouds at 3000 feet AGL scattered clouds at 6000 feet AGL broken clouds at 12000 feet AGL broken clouds at 20000 feet AGL   The traverse of the sky seemed to match that of a large raptor at approx 1000 feet altitude.  The time it took to gain distance, etc.  This is what I thought I was seeing, until it brightly reflected the sun for a brief moment.  It it were at 5000 feet, it was traveling at approx. 250 knots.  At 10,000, triple that. I report this in case others may report a similar or related incident.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
