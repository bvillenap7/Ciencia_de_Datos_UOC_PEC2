2 Buring Jellyfish in the sky;2010-06-01 10:00:00;4 Minutes;2 Buring Jellyfish in the sky My daugter and I were in the front yard at night enjoying the night air, and I saw a glowing light come over the tree line across the street, and it moved very slowly over my head and it seemed to be only 200-300 ft above.   I looked like like a jellyfish shape and it looked like it was burning inside  like fire and slowly ascended into the sky and disappeared.   One minute later it happened again.  I thought it was just some kind of balloon, but it moved horizontal across the sky and not straight up.   I can't explain how this could have been reproduced by kids messing around or something.  This is my first time seeing anything like this. I'm not real sure on the date , but I know it wasn't fireworks;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
