Large harvest moon shaped object between the hills in Auburn Wa.;1999-08-27 05:30:00;a few seconds;Large harvest moon shaped object between the hills in Auburn Wa. I am a registered nurse who was on the way for weekend duty at a hospital in Federal Way.  I am not sure on the date, since it has been so long ago, but I think it was the end of August of 1999.At that time, I was not aware of this site, so my posting is late. But,I am aware that there was at least one other person that saw the same thing I did. That person filed a report here and I found it when doing a search in the archives of this site. For that person--- Here is what I too, saw. I was leaving my home in Lakeland Hills @ 0530, turned the corner and looked over to the left towards the dead in road, where the the hill drops off to a valley. I saw a low-lying- almost at the horizon level harvest moon but it had some kind of angular shape in front of it. It was huge and beautiful but something about the black angular shape in front of it bothered me- a weird, weird black shape. I turned right  and kept driving- a few seconds later, I then looked over to my left again to try to get a glimse of Mt. Raineer. I was completely shocked when I saw the real moon way, way up in the sky and it was not a full moon at all!! I wondered then, what had I seen just a few seconds earlier.

Saw a small round metalic dot at very high altitude. It moved very slowly until out of sight.;2005-06-24 14:00:00;30 minutes;Saw a small round metalic dot at very high altitude. It moved very slowly until out of sight. I was working under my motorhome right outside my shop. There was a space of about 3 feet between the front of the motorhome and the shop. I slid out from under the front to answer a cell phone call. I laid back on the ground and looked up. Just 12 infront of the eve line of the shop I noticed a small dot way up in the sky. I looked at it for a few minutes and talked about it to the person on the phone. The dot must have been extremey high. I expected it to move out of sight in just a couple of seconds. Figuring it must be a jet at a very high altitude. When it didn't move, I really got interested and lined it up with the overhang. It moved about 1/2 in 5 minutes. I got up and walked around and couldn't locate it. I laid back down and it was still there. I do not know why I didn't go get someone else to look at it. I guess I was expecting it to move. It was not an airplane or a helicopter. I am used to the trafic from Seatac and Auburn Airport and have an Aircraft back ground. Just thought you might be interested. And to see if anyone else has reported seeing it. It was just a tiny round dot. But very metalic looking.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Silent Daytime Disc Disappears When Just Out Of Sight.  Prior to recalling abduction.;2005-10-21 07:00:00;40 seconds;Silent Daytime Disc Disappears When Just Out Of Sight.  Prior to recalling abduction. ...I got out of work early and went the long way around when leaving mowhawk plastic.  I saw a disc floating as if it was pointing at me, at a parallel tilted angle.  I was taking off my jacket at the time while driving, so I kind of struggled for a second to get it off. I immediately starting bouncing my head up and down, just to see if i could throw it off, to assume it was some sort of controlled hallucination as Mr. Hilary Evans refers to it.  Only at the time, I had no idea of such notions, that this ufo could be a manifestation by the greys via implants... Anyway, I bounced my head up and down, thinking that maybe it was a projection on my window, I guess it seemed to real and since it was something no one ever sees 's, it was highly probable that I would question if it really existed.  Perhaps on a subconscious level, I could tell I was a pre-recorded overlaying image because the lighting didn't mesh? idk. At any rate, I saw a ufo in Auburn, right next to A street.  I was stunned that no one else could have seen it yet I suppose it was back far enough, and low enough to where no one could have seen it. Looking at it now, I know that I was suppose to see such a craft considering what happend next. So I hit the gas as I went around the closed building at mow how plastic (building b I think). At the time their was a row of pine trees, with a fence on the other side.  Anyway, the silent daytime disc slowly floated across the sky from right to left, and I was aware that it was going to be out of my visual path soon. I hit the gas and was going about 35 or 40 i want to say, blindly while hoping that someone else didnt decided to leave work.  I suppose if I would have smashed up my car i would have blamed the ufo, considering i was being reckless just so I could keep my eyes on the object. It was black metal, i could see the welding marks, like extensions. It was a full out disc just as everyone has been explaining, and it was, in fact, the size of a football field, yet a perfect circle.  There were even windows deep into the center of the vehicle, as it did not spin.  It was silent as if it was not really there at all. Anyway, I was going very fast, while hunched forward and looking at this daytime disc.  I think some poppy song was on the radio, like poker face or something, I remember 1077 was on at least. Anyway it was just barely out of my reach visually, for about 2 or three seconds.  I had to slow down considering it was a right angle, though really I went as fast as i possibly could. It was odd, because this clearly was their goal, to appear in a place where i could not see them disappear. Anyway, I turned the corner and it was gone.  As if nothing was ever there in the first place. just as many other victims of the greys have claimed, the ufo seemed to disappear the second I rounded the corner.  It was so silent as if it was really some sort of implant manipulation.   What Dr Karla Turner calls illusionary tacts.   What Mr Hilary evans calls controlled hallucinations. When I first saw the disc i told no one.  I felt like perhaps it was the military playing tricks on me.  Then about 2 years later…  I recalled my seventeen-year-old abduction.  A bunch of snippets of blacked out moments, as the greys seemed to somehow have endorphin control. I kid you not, this must have been a warning since they knew I would recall?  Then again, perhaps it was just some other human uploading images via implants?  All I know is, I saw a ufo in October of 2005, and I didn't quite think it was real.  I highly questioned it even though it didn't really look like a 3d graphic, though nowadays it hard to tell. If you asked me, what do you think the purpose of abduction is? I would tell you, I think the alien greys take our out of body, I call it close encounters of the eighth kind, to have your out of body takin as you as awake, associated with having your soul sucked out from you - mandrake1975   Anyway, Please visit my abduction music at Pyridoxine Oxide  If you wish. Thanks for giving me a chance to explain.  I know I told mufon but they are kind of a joke, I looked and it seems you don't even have my account.  Auburn 2005 Wa Black Metal Welded Disc, Disappeared conveniently as i rounded the corner, October 21st (I want to say it was the 21st) God bless, screw the greys. Thanks for giving me a chance to be heard, it really means a lot to me.  I hope you dont erase this post like the greys erased my memories involving the seventeen-year-old abduction.  GOD BLeSS!!;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Red, circular, unknown craft over Auburn, WA on the 4th of July 2009 at 10:00 PM;2009-07-04 22:00:00;3 minutes;Red, circular, unknown craft over Auburn, WA on the 4th of July 2009 at 10:00 PM I was sitting in a chair in our back yard. I was waiting for my father and brother in law to shoot off the last firework.  I was looking to the South observing the neighbor's fireworks when a red light caught my attention.  I watched it for about 5 seconds, waiting for it to explode or disappear like normal fireworks.  I realized while I was waiting that I had never seen a firework sit for so long in the sky without disappearing.   It was a red light that about every 3 seconds flashed a gold light from the bottom.  My next guess was that it was an air balloon, then I realized I had never seen an air balloon at 10:pm at night.  The shape - the best way I can describe it is by calling it a circle.  I don't believe it was an airplane because there were no hazard lights and I don't think it was a helicopter either.  I don't really know what I would call it.  It was on a steady path and it seemed to be moving in a line. It didn't waver, and it seemed to be progressing quickly.   After about a minute and a half, I stood up and walked about three and a half feet to join the other 13 individuals who were observing its progress.  None of us were drunk or on any kind of medication.  We all noticed that it had a red light and seemed to be flying about the same level as a commercial airplane.   After about three minutes, the object was getting smaller and smaller and it finally disappeared.  One individual had a camera and was able to capture a few pictures.  I am no aviation expert, and I don't know exactly what it was.   The above statement is true and accurate to the best of my recollection.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
2 colorful orbs playing in the sky with mothership (white orb) watching...;2011-11-26 11:45:00;5-10 minutes;2 colorful orbs playing in the sky with mothership (white orb) watching... I was the first to see it.  It was a bright neon indigo blue orb it looked as if it literally came out of the sky. It the western side of the sky towards the Pacific Ocean.  It began to fly towards us but then stopped, became a royal blue color and started falling towards land at a ridiculous speed but as it was falling it started to change colors.  It kept changing from a blood red to royal blue back and forth as it fell. The way the colors changed seemed like they morphed into each other. While it was falling it came to an abrupt stop and flew left or south bound. And when it came back up, another orb appeared. This orb was a stunning turquoise color and it would morph into yellow-green but mostly stayed turquoise. Now these two orbs would just fly around in the sky, but not necessarily in the sky but lower than airplanes would. It seemed like they were just playing around with each other because they would fly around in almost a playful manner. Continually morphing into the different colors. The royal blue orb can fly the highest into the air but the turquoise orb could not it would remain lower. Now, on the right side, a white orb began to appear.  It slowly appeared into a bigger white orb. The thing about all the orbs was that they were solids they looked like they had a core center with a a lighter color aura around them. The lighter color was the same color as the core color regardless of how much it changed colors but it was more translucent. Now, the white orb never moved it stayed perfectly stil, almost just hovering in the air. There was a time when the aura on the white orb became bigger but went back to it original size. The two colorful orbs were playfully flying around in the sky i noticed they would never get really close to the white orb but will fly around it. There was about 3 air planes that flew by. It seemed as if the two that were coming north bound seen it because they were flying really close to each other like they were scared. Air planes do not normally fly that close to each other. The two colorful obs began to play more vigorously they were doing trick like going from opposite sides of the sky and flying really fast towards each other like they were going to smash but right before would steer off in opposite directions. Then slowly the two orbs slowly flew towards the white orb and formed a triangle. The triangle stayed in the position for a few minutes. It stayed perfectly stil just hovering in the sky. I believe the white orb represented the 90 degree angle. The royal blue orb was directly north of the white orb and the turquoise orb was left/south of the white orb. After they stopped making the triangle formation, the royal blue and turquoise orb went back to the south/left side of the sky and they continued flying in a circular motion/ figure 8 motion. Then the royal blue flew back north from where it originally came from, the turquoise went back to the left/south side and just disappeared. The white orb slowly faded out. What I noticed was that the positions the orbs came from, though they were very much apart, still formed a triangle. The best way to describe it was like connecting the constellations and it formed a triangle.  We watched for a while but it did not return we returned about 10 minutes later but they were not there.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Bright, circular in shape object, moving from a 3 o'clock position in the sky to the 12 o'clock position before dissapearing;2012-04-21 22:25:00;3-5 minutes;bright, circular in shape object, moving from a 3 o'clock position in the sky to the 12 o'clock position before dissapearing I was looking up into the sky noticing how clear it was.  I was looking out towards the west, which would be toward the Seattle airport from where I live.  Because of this I am often aware of aircraft in the distance.  Normally I watch very carefully for any sign that would let me know that it is an airplane, flashing lights, in line for landing, etc.  I noticed that either the planet Venus or Jupiter was noticeable and very bright.  Looking down and to the left of the bright planet, there was another very bright light, which I initially took as a star.  Confused by this because it was so bright and I was unfamiliar with any other planet being that close to another one at this time, I looked at it for a few minutes.  In that time of watching it, it began to move slowly up from a three o’clock position up to what I would call the 12 o’clock position.  It moved very slow and precise across the sky.  I continued watching it because I was thinking that it had to! be an airplane.  Because it never flashed any red lights or changed from its original bright state, I started thinking it had to be a UFO.   As it stayed at the 12 o’clock position above my head for a few second it was if someone turned off a light switch and I know longer saw any light from it again.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Bright white/blue object followed by 3 helicopters, then disappears;2012-09-04 20:00:00;45 seconds- 2 hours;Bright white/blue object followed by 3 helicopters, then disappears On the night of September 4th, 2012, I was headed home, down Lea Hill, in Auburn, Washington. Once I reached the bottom of the hill, I could see clearly across the Green River Valley, all the way to the West Hill, roughly 5-7 miles away. The sky was clear, crystal clear, and the moon had yet to rise above the eastern horizon( I was driving west.)  Sea-tac International Airport is located about 12 miles north of where I was looking, and it is very common to see the lights of planes taking off and landing at the airport, during all hours of the day and night. When I looked across the valley, I noticed four lights, flying lower than the peak of West Hill. Three of the lights had blinking lights, and from my experience, appeared (and sounded) like helicopters. The 4th light, which they were following, about 200 yards behind, was an incredibly bright, unblinking white/blue light, about the size of a large sized pickup. The heli's followed the object, which remained in complete and clear field of view, for nearly 3o seconds, North along (what I would assume) highway 167.  Then, the object/light turned abruptly due east, and traveled for another 15-20 seconds, before fading away and completely disappearing. I was following, as closely as possible, and could hear the helicopters clearly, but no other noise could be heard from the object.  Once the light disappeared, the helicopters began to fly in a concentric circular pattern, slowly spiraling away from the last location of the light, until the 3 were flying completely around Auburn and South Kent.  Around the same time, I noticed an unusual amount of air traffic over Auburn. I watch the commercial airliners every day and night, and am quite familiar with the lights and flight patters of these aircraft. The unusual air traffic, though, did not have the same characteristics what-so-ever of the normal every day planes. There were no lights on the tail, not the normal ACL lights flashing on the underside or wingtips. The planes appeared to be darker in coolor, and not flying the normal pattern to land at Sea-Tac. The helicopters were present for about 2 hours after the light disappeared, then around 11pm, they all flew away, in! opposite directions;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

As I looked up at the sky to watch the fireworks, a flaming ball appeared out of the sky just above the neighborhood across the highway.  It literally looked like it was coming right towards us. I knew it wasn't an aircraft.  I know of what those look like at night.  As it looked like it was coming straight at us, it took a sharp right and started to move fast in an eastward direction.   I was able to I pull out my phone and record the last few seconds of it being in site at 1080p 60 frames per second. As the object moved east it literally darted off in the distance.  We looked up at a 30 to 40 degree angle.  Trees slightly blocked our view. And it looked like it was about a mile away. Very creepy and surprising to see.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Quavering/shimmering red object near moon in east sky around 9:25 pm.;2013-09-19 21:23:00;~2.5 minutes;Quavering/shimmering red object near moon in east sky around 9:25 pm. I am located on a residential airstrip SE of Seattle, Lat/Long coordinates: 47-16.089367N / 122-04.073550W. At about 9:25pm/1:25 I happened to observe a reddish object about the size of Venus about 10 degrees (azimuth) south of the rising moon at the same elevation.  This would put it about 100 deg. true from our location.  I estimate elevation to be about 20 or 25 degrees, again approximately level with the rising moon at 9:25pm local. This object appeared to be moving WNW and I at first thought it might be an aircraft inbound to SeaTac.  The reddish color (more red than Mars and far brighter) had a quavering appearance.  Not flashing like aircraft strobes and not twinkling like planets or stars as affected by our atmosphere, but a semi-periodic variation from bright to not as bright.  I called the neighbor who joined me and observed the same and we were both struck by how red and unusual it appeared.  As we watched, it appeared to start moving to the east (as judged by standing in one place and referencing the eve of a 2 story house), then dimmed and disappeared over a period of 10 seconds or so. This observation was very different than anything I’ve seen (satellite, Space Station, etc.)  It was brighter, redder, larger and had “non-conforming” motion.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Object appeared to be on fire, but steady control, altitude and direction.;2016-11-12 21:10:00;~1 minute;Object appeared to be on fire, but steady control, altitude and direction. Sighting – 11/12/16 9:10 PST I, ((name deleted)), stepped out of my garage and walked toward our house.  I happened to look to the generally eastern sky, and saw an object that appeared to be on fire in flight.  It appeared to be perhaps 1-2 miles away and perhaps an altitude of 1000-2000 feet.  We live just 10 miles or so from Seatac Airport, so are very used to seeing aircraft. I pulled out my iPhone6 and thought that I had begun filming shortly after first noticing it, but later determined that I wasn’t and started.  I got 21 seconds of video, but not nearly as close as at first.  My total observation was probably just less than a minute, which means the object might have been moving roughly 100 MPH.  There was little wind, when I checked the Auburn weather, the last report was just 3 MPH at 9:55 PM. The object attracted my attention for several reasons.  One, it was the color of and appeared to be on fire.  Two, I couldn’t discern that it was making any noise.  Three, it moved from that eastern view toward Seattle (a Northerly direction) until it disappeared behind a distant cloudbank.  It appeared to maintain a constant trajectory and speed.  Relative to the almost full moon (sky very clear for Seattle), the object was perhaps 1/10 of the size of the moon.  I have seen satellites and even the Space Station in orbit, and this was not in orbit and dramatically larger looking.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

I see airplanes and jets all the time, due to living close to Auburn airport, and being within the flight path(s) of Seatac International airport, and this was something I haven’t seen before.
