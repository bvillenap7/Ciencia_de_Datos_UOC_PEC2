The stayed the same size and shape and then veared off to the west in a slow arch.  We walked and followed the objects trying to watch them as they went behind some large pine trees.

Bright flash of light seen in the sky and apparently headed directly under a commercial airline flight headed for SeaTac Airport;2000-11-16 23:00:00;4-5 seconds;Bright flash of light seen in the sky and apparently headed directly under a commercial airline flight headed for SeaTac Airport At approximately 23:00 hrs on Wednesday, Nov 16, I was having a cigarette facing out the back door of my house.  Suddenly a fireball appeared, resembling the shape of the afterburners on a military jet.  It was whitish yellow in  color.  It moved quickly across the sky from  east to west and seemed to be traveling directly under a commercial airline flight that was landing at that time.  I was actually afraid the object would collide with the airliner.  I stepped out side and did hear the sound of engines but could not determine if it was from the airliner or from the object.  I believe anyone looking from the airliner would have seen it.  It was a 3/4 moon, and a clear night. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports of this event, seen from as far south as Eugene, OR, and from as far north as British Columbia.  We believe a correct time is 2308 hrs..

It was green and white in color and I took it to be meteor. I think it fell to the ground because I could see it fall between the trees which was in the lake tapps area. I've seen a lot of meteors before, but not one to last this long or to hit the ground. Any reports of something hitting the ground in southern wa. tonight?

Flashing orb confuses and amazes people in Auburn, Washington.;2009-07-04 22:00:00;3 minutes;Flashing orb confuses and amazes people in Auburn Washington I was slightly away from the middle of our backyard, about to light a firework, when I saw something gold-ish orange in the Southern sky and I thought at first it was a firework, but it wasn't going off, it was flashing, and every time it dimmed, there were three smaller lights I could see.  The smaller lights compared to the other light seemed stationary and in the rough shape of a triangle.  I heard people saying What is that and people were scrambling to get a camera.   It was going in a straight line, and the light dimmed as it was heading away in a straight line towards the West.  It appeared to be solid, but also appeared to be made of light.  I felt confusion when I saw it, because I could not tell what it was.  The main reason I would not think of it as normal aircraft is because it didn't have those safety lights, and it didn't appear to blink, but it seemed to be fading in and our from the orang-ish gold color to the three smaller lights.   While I was watching it, everything seemed to be quieter than normal. Kind of like the same effect snow has - Where everything seems quiet.  I seemed to see a lot of detail in it even without wearing my glasses.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

While driving northbound on highway 167 in Auburn, WA, I sighted a large green ball approximately 100ft from the ground.  It was hurtling toward the earth.   If it impacted the ground, it made no audible sound.   It was large, maybe 15x15ft in diameter.  It was only in the sky for 5-10 seconds because it was moving quickly.  It disappeared over the west side of the highway.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
