small fast ball of orange light moving east to west above the treetops.;1998-11-16 22:40:00;6 second;small fast ball of orange light moving east to west above the treetops. I am a radar Air Traffic Controller with the FAA. I was on my way home and my brother was with me. I had just turned off Highway 18 near S.I.R. in Kent, WA. When I rounded the turn on the exit ramp I saw a very bright, round ball of orange light. It was small from my view and at treetop level.  I have no way of judging the distance because it was just hazy enough to block out any terrain refferences or landmarks.  The object appeared at about 15 degrees above the horizon, at treetop level (from my perspective).  The object was south of my position. It moved at a high rate of speed from East to West. I observed it for about 6 seconds then it was gone. When I made the turn off the highway I was headed West, the light was moving past me, not in the opposite direction as when you pass a light on a pole. About a minute after this I turned on The Art Bell Show and Peter Davenport was playing a clip from a woman who described almost exactly what I just saw. Please do not use my name as my supervisors are not a openminded about these things as we are.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

The light traveled at a very high rate of speed visible for only a second or two and was followed by a tail like a meteor as it streaked by. I calculate that the light was very large, measuring the size of my small finger nail at arms length. The light which appeared to be in our atmosphere was heading west in a horizontal position at about 40 degrees off the horizon. I went outside immediately to check the sky for conditions or meteor shower activity and found it to be a clear sky no cloud cover and saw no meteor activity in a twenty minute time period. The light had to have been very bright to have shown so distinct and bright against several backyard lights that I had on at the time. I am a UFO investigator for MUFON.

My husband and I were traveling north on Hwy 167 in Auburn Wa, when I noticed a very bright light in the sky traveling north over head,  I first assumed it was an airplane since there were 3 or 4 aircraft in the general area, but then I noticed there were no flashing green or red type lights usually seen on aircraft,  this object was traveling 4 to 5 times faster then the aircraft in the area.   It flew in a direct straight path heading north until it was out of sight.  Moving faster then a jet airplane but not as fast as a meteor, no tail or burn out. I pointed it out to my husband who was driving the car and we both watched it until it flew out of sight.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Bright light seen neer Auburn super mall;2000-09-23 19:30:00;aprox 3 minutes;Bright light seen neer Auburn super mall I'm a 'contactee', I've had several sightings and contact over the course of my life.  Under the circumstances I tend to take notice of everything that moves in the sky.  Tonight I saw a very, very large light holding a stationary position just South East of the super mall in Auburn.  A plane was flying in a pattern near the object and another light was a great distance East.  I couldn't tell if that object was a plane or not.  I only had a short time to view the object, but I've seen similar.  The light from the object was slightly golden in color, very bright.  I've been told that hot-air balloons are known to be in the area, but I rule this out for this sighting.  The size of the light in comparison to the aircraft was quite large.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Bright Light with direction change;2005-06-23 00:25:00;20-40sec;Bright Light with direction change I was stargazing thru the front window of our apartment which has a view due West. The sky was clear. I had just got done watching a high flying jet that was going from North to South leaving a trail. About 30 seconds later a VERY bright light caught my eye. It was 80 degrees above the horizon SSW of my position. At first I thought it was a planet that I had somehow missed, but it was atleast 10 times the brightness of Venus and was moving slowly in a Northerly direction. It then began to dim to the brightness of the dimmest stars I could see, so I naturally thought that this was an Irridium flare. I then opened the window to get an unobstructed view with the binoculars. All of the sudden it was now moving in a Southerly direction, exactly opposite of what it was at first doing. I saw the direction change, it did not turn at all, but instead just instantly was going in the opposite direction. I watched it until I lost sight of it behind the roof of the building.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

All of sudden, the star or craft was glowing white bright light to about 5 or 6 times of Venus and its size. It shaped like a big cross due to its size and brightness for several seconds. The light was diminished to tiny yellow dot, flying zigzag pattern form to north and finally disappeared. It wasn't a shooting star for sure but I am not convinced that this was any astronomical phenomena either.

She looked up and asked me what the lights were in the sky.  I looked up and saw two lights moving around below the cloud deck.  I thought they were birds with the sun shining on them.  But they were not moving like birds, they were flying around each other and in and out of the clouds. I cannot explain what we saw, but after about 15-20 min they were gone.  I could not get a pic of them. They were small spots of light moving in a pattern to tight and fast for a airplane or helicopter of any kind.  And there was no sound from them.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

As I drove North along SR-167, about 3 to 4 miles South of Renton,at about 60mph, I saw a group of approx 7 to 9 amber lights above the NE horizon about 45*.  They were moving parallel with me, heading North in a organized linear formation but moving Independence of each other.   As I began to comprehend what I was seeing, I pulled to the shoulder to get a Fixed perspective.   I then, was absolutely certain I was witnessing a UFO of some kind.  I noticed other motorists stopping along the road as well.   My passenger, a 10 yr old, was skeptical, listing many explanations, helo, fixed wing prop, jet, meteor.   I explained each away as no red light, no pulsating, no sound.   The speed, direction and nature of the movement was not consistent with any single crafts capabilities.  I then continued along SR-167 to the Central Ave exit, then continued North along Central Ave at which time the illumination of the objects began to fade at varied rates until no longer visible.   The event transpired over a span of about 5 to 8 min.   Upon return home, I am searching for others that saw the same thing.

Really Fast light heading due South;2011-08-23 21:24:00;3-5 seconds;Really Fast light heading due South I was in my son's room and heard a commotion outside. I looked out and saw that there were some kids messing around and they had taken the balloons that are sometimes outside of the office, across the parking lot. They ran west in front of the office and around the corner and then south away from me. As they did this they let go of the balloons which floated up into the sky. I was watching the balloons float higher and higher and lost sight of them, and since I was already looking at the sky, I decided to see what stars I could see. At this time is when I saw what I first thought was a satellite. I quickly realized that this was about twice the size of what a satellite usually looks like, although it was the same brightness as the typical satellite, maybe a tad brighter.  The other thing that I noticed was that it was the fastest satellite that I have ever seen. I have seen hundreds of satellites in my years of stargazing, but nothing this fast. It wasn't anywhere near as fast as a shooting star, but for anything else, it was fast. I would estimate that it was going 2-3 times as fast as a quick moving satellite. I looked away from it for just long enough to raise the blinds the rest of the way up, they were half way down, when I looked back where it should be, it was either gone or turned off.  Almost forgot to mention, it was heading due south.  I also checked on Heavens Above and didn't see satellites for the time I saw it or any going from North to South. It also was not the ISS. I've seen it many many times and know that that was not it.  The ISS is much brighter than what I saw and also much slower than what I saw, not to mention that it had already passed by this area at at 9:07pm, and went from WNW to ENE, so it was well to the north of me.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

Weird light hovers and disappears;2012-05-08 00:31:00;10 seconds;Weird light hovers and disappears I went to the window that faces due south to look at the moon. It's not full, but it's still quite big and bright. I missed the Supermoon on Saturday due to cloud cover. Tonight there are a few lines of clouds, but the sky is mostly clear.  As I was looking at the moon with my face pressed against the screen, I noticed a bright light out of the corner of my eye. It was approximately at 110 degrees azimuth and 40 to 45 degrees in altitude.  It was quite large compared to stars, about the size of airplane landing lights. It was about the same brightness as aircraft landing lights, although it had a slightly dimmer, slightly more orange tint to it. I've seen many planes heading to Seatac coming from around that direction, do my first thought was that is what it is, but I quickly realized that this light appeared to not be moving. It was just sitting there.  I thought that was weird, and in my mind I said to myself, What the f*** is that.  As soon as I thought tha! t, it appeared that the light started slightly moving to the SE. It dimmed and blinked twice, then went out completely.  I went and wrote down my observations and then went back to the window to see if it would reappear, but after a few minutes it did not reappear, so I sent in this report.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
Weird lights seen over Auburn;2012-07-03 21:45:00;12 minutes;Weird lights seen over Auburn Last night, 3 July 2012, my wife and I went to watch the fireworks display at Emerald Downs. We ended up West of Hwy. 167 just off 15th St. NW on Terrace Dr.  We parked on the hill and had a good view of the fireworks. We arrived at that location at approx. 9:45pm, about 30 minutes before the fireworks started.   As we waited for the show to begin, we witnessed a small orange light liftoff in what appeared to be the vicinity of the airport, possibly a bit north of it and quite possibly farther off than we suspected.  It definitely was not a firework of any sort.  It kept the same constant brightness and size the entire time we watched it.  It rose slowly at first and at a point that was about even with our line of sight (we were about a hundred feet in elevation above the valley) it stopped and hovered for about 5 to 10 seconds. It then continued rising in elevation at a faster rate than before.   Within about 15 seconds it was very high in the sky, about 70 degrees in elevation.  At this point we lost sight of it, either it went out or entered into the cloud. I can't be sure which. About 10 minutes later, another light that looked exactly like the first one, was flying towards us.  This time it was coming in from the North.  I pointed it out to my wife and she also saw it.  Soon after this it seemed to stop forward motion and sort of hovered and went a bit higher at the same time, and a few seconds later either went out or went into the cloud. At no time did we hear any sound from these objects.  There were many commercial planes flying over head heading East after having taken off from SeaTac and we saw one private plane, all of these had the normal lighting and we could hear each one of them, but not the curious orange lights. All in all these lights seemed to be pretty small and not that bright, and with all the fireworks going on I doubt anyone else saw these.  I also don't think I would class these as fireballs, like you talked about on C2C or Jeff Rense recently.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135
5 orange'ish/amber light sources apparently unconnected to normal air traffic in our area were observed over a period of 40 minutes;2013-07-04 22:15:00;40 minutes;5 orange'ish/amber light sources apparently unconnected to normal air traffic in our area were observed over a period of 40 minutes My wife and I were watching the fireworks last night.  Where our house sits relative to the fields and lakes around here where folks launch their fireworks we can only catch the highest bursts, and those only through gaps in the trees.   We do have a relatively unobstructed view of the southern approaches/departures to SEATAC.  I’m a private pilot (single engine land, ground school for IFR ‘haven’t flown in years, though), and do enjoy watching the SEATAC traffic when I get the chance. During the fireworks, at between approximately 10:15 and 10:45, we saw 5 orange’ish/amber lights not apparently connected to the usual approaches and departures (departures were to the south at SEATAC last night), not associated with any other lighting typical of the aircraft we see around here, and not apparently connected to the fireworks, moving from low on the horizon west (True bearing magnetic variance is ~17 degrees east) of us to various headings and elevations.  Each light was a discrete, constant point source.  I am not familiar with any aircraft lighting systems that have a single orange’ish/amber constant light.  No sound was associated with the lights.  There were no apparent trails indicative of an exhaust plume.  The lights all appeared to be the same size, shape, color, and initial intensity, though their directions of flight were varied.  We had a commercial jet pass farther to the south of us than the first pair of lights we saw, sometime between the appea! rance of the fourth and fifth lights as part of its departure from SEATAC, and we could just make out the sound of its engines.  The first two lights we saw appeared to be moving together from west of us to east-southeast.  They were climbing together but not apparently connected to the same structure as they moved toward and a little southward of our house.  They seemed to shift position a bit with respect to each other, and were likely no less than 100 ft apart from each other while we could see them approaching.  One of them started to pass in and out of the thin broken stratiform cloud layer we had last night before we lost sight of them from our vantage point at a window on the west side of the house.  Given their trajectory and distance from us, their speed seemed to be somewhere around 120-180 kts, but we couldn’t see any aircraft structure to get a really confident estimate of distance, and their shifting position made speed estimates from looming difficult.  The third light we saw appeared a few minutes after we lost sight of the first pair.  This second light appeared identical in every way to the first two (i.e., size, orange’ish/amber, discrete, constant point source).  We noticed it starting from a little bit north of where the first two came from, westward of our house.  It seemed to be climbing at about the same rate as the first two at first, but to the northeast.  We lost sight of this light when it passed into the clouds and to the north of our house.  It seemed to increase its vertical speed as it was entering the cloud layer, and perhaps turning to the north, since its headway to the east slowed down considerably as its size and intensity wained (we could see it climbing through a large gap in the clouds).  The fourth light appeared in the same area of the horizon as the first pair a few minutes after we lost sight of the third light.  It appeared to follow the same trajectory as the first pair.  It was otherwise unremarkable.  The fifth light appeared in the same area of the horizon as the third light a few minutes after we lost sight of the fourth light.  The fifth light was climbing at a considerable rate to the north, perhaps north-northwest, and was out of sight much faster than the other four lights.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

A steady, amber/orange, single point light was seen in the sky above the horizon to the northwest of our house.  Commercial aircraft were landing to the North at SEATAC two aircraft were observed moving down the approach to SEATAC from the southwest to the west-northwest horizon from our vantage point while the amber/orange light was in the northwest sky.  Local fireworks in celebration of the Seahawks Superbowl win were seen through the trees all around the western horizon as seen from our house. The light appeared to move very slowly southward or south-southeastward from the first position we saw it in the northwest, 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon.  The light appeared to change its direction and speed of movement from southward or southeastward, to southwestward, and rapidly increase its altitude.  After about 13 minutes from when we first spotted the light above the NW horizon we lost sight of it to the west of our position and roughly 70 degrees elevation.;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

Lights in the western sky over Auburn, WA, night after night, not normal aircraft.;2018-07-03 22:00:00;several hours;Lights in the western sky over Auburn, WA, night after night, not normal aircraft. These lights have been appearing nightly for at least two years, beginning at about dark, in the sky either over western Auburn, or slightly farther west. They are not conventional aircraft.  They do not have any red/green running lights, they are much brighter usually, and often they flash brighter, systematically.  They are composed of what appears to be either one, or as many as 3-4, bright white lights.  They hang in the sky for several hours usually, sometimes moving short distances to the left and right (as viewed from east of them, on Lea Hill Road in Auburn), sometimes moving farther to the north. There are normally three or four of these objects which appear at once.  The normal air traffic in the area can be seen passing in front of them, and it seems to ignore their presence.  Sometimes the objects appear to flash red or blue.  They are almost always present for at least 2-3 hours, and sometimes have been present as late as 3 AM. I am a professional UFO author, a witness of at least a half-dozen sightings of alien spacecraft during my life, and an abductee as well.  I am not likely to misidentify conventional craft as a UFO.  I am familiar with most types of military craft, including stealth craft and exotic craft. I do not know what these craft are, but they cannot be conventional aircraft in my opinion due to their configuration of lights, motion in the sky, presence in the same location for so many nights, and the fact that they are clearly brighter than conventional aircraft’s white lights.  They should easily be spotted by radar from Auburn airport, Boeing Field and Seatac. As to the possibility that they could be drones, I tend to doubt that idea.  There is no reason that I can think of for drones to take up the same position in the sky, night after night, for literally years on end, when there is nothing of particular interest happening in or around Auburn that anyone would have reason to go to so much trouble and expense to observe.  They clearly are unconcerned about being seen, and usually just hang in the sky, moving short distances roughly north or south and then returning to where they were initially. Could they be some type of alien craft?  I cannot answer that question, I only know they appear to be distinctly different in appearance to conventional or military aircraft I am familiar with.  Someone surely will be able to identify them, from Seatac or Boeing ATC centers.  Whether they will do so honestly is another question. ((NUFORC Note:  It seems noteworthy that NUFORC has received no other reports about the alleged, nightly sightings.  We will encourage the witness to obtain high-quality photos of the alleged objects.  PD));47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

Within 200 yards of the plane hitting the ball of light the light/object phased out into blackness.   At first I thought it was the Moon, or a Helicopter, because the light was so big and bright.  After investigating the Moon over the last few days, I came to the conclusion it couldn't have been the Moon, and a Helicopter would not have turned its lights off in the path of a jetliner?;47.2974141891892;-122.181185135135

The lights moved across the sky very slowly, with the lights remaining constant no flickering, on/off, pulsing, etc.  After roughly 1.5 minutes moving from south to north, they abruptly disappeared in what I would estimate to be probably the Kent or north Auburn area.   I didn’t know what to make of it until about 5-10 seconds later the lights returned moving west over the top of the Sea-Tac airport at an unfathomable rate of speed, and within 1-2 seconds the lights disappeared past the horizon.
