Possible Siting in the Tukwila Wa area;2009-10-03 22:30:00;15 min;Possible Siting in the Tukwila Wa area The objects we saw were circular and had a orange/yellow glow. They were formed in a diamond formation. We continued to watch the objects and notice that one at a time they disappeared. These object was right above the Interurban/Grady Way intersection near the Family Fun Center area. The reason why we new this was something strange, is because we've driven in the area many times as we live in the area, and have never seen anything like that before.
