4 bright, platinum white, round lights, were seen on top of a hill.  The lights were situated in a circle.  From our car in Tukwila, WA;1998-07-17 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;4 bright, platinum white, round lights, were seen on top of a hill.  The lights were situated in a circle.  From our car in Tukwila, WA, we saw the lights to the east. On July 17, 1998, we were in our car, riding on a road in Tukwila, WA, that we have frequently traveled.  To the east, high atop a hill, we saw four circular bright lights.  The lights were situated in a circle, and seemed to be stark or platinum white.  They were very bright.  We were not aware of any towers, construction, airplanes, etc. that could be located on the hill.  We parked in our car, along the road and watched for about 2-3 minutes.  We then, went to an intersection where we could see straight down the road, and had even a more clear view of the lights.  They did not blink, they remained perfectly still.  We left.  We returned to the same location the following evening- July 18th, at approximately 2200 p.m. to see the lights.  They were gone.;47.4827869565217;-122.280965217391
Sea-Tac  Washington,  solid red and orange object streaks across sky;2002-08-07 22:10:00;3-4 seconds;Sea-Tac  Washington,  solid red and orange object streaks across sky at approxamately 22:10 I was looking in a southeasterly direction and observed a small plane landing at a close-by landing strip, I saw the landing lights come on and proceded to land.  22:11 I looked back in the southeast and saw something with no flashing red or green lights. It looked like a raindrop on it's side with solid red on the top and solid orange on the bottom, it left a streak behind it for about 2-3 seconds, it appeared and disappeared without a sound even though it was traveling high in the sky and horizontal.  I then observed a aircraft following behind at a very much slower rate of speed, this aircraft had red and green flashing lights, a conventional aircraft.  The observation didn't last very long because of the speed of the flying object. I have lived near an airport for 20 plus years, I have seen satelites traveling in an arch high in the sky, I have seen meteor showers arching downward as they enter the atmosphere, but I have never seen something move horizontal and with no conventional aircraft lights.;47.4827869565217;-122.280965217391

saw a bright light changeing colors red, green, blue, white.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Sirius.  PD));2007-09-09 22:00:00;30 min;saw a bright light changeing colors red,green, blue,white. well not sure what it is, a planet(?).  At least that is what I thought at first,then maybe a plane,mmm. Wasnt moving, saw other planes flying flashing lights, but what got my attention was the flashing light changeing red, green, blue, then bright white. The light is north of me, so I went and grabbed my binoculars.So once I had them and took a look I was and am still not sure what I saw. Very bright green then red then blue and white flashing lights. Now this sounds strange but I thought it changed shape from a small star shaped light to a triangle shaped light, all the while change colors. So I then picked out a couple diffrent stars and looked at them,not the same. I watched it for about fifteen min. Don't have a clue.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Sirius.

Bright star type light in sky near Tukwila, WA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus.  PD));2009-02-03 20:00:00;1hr;Bright star type light in sky near Tukwila, WA Ok earlier tonight I walked to the store to get some smokes and I saw a really bright light up in the sky which i looked at for about 10 min when I left the store. I decided to show my gf once I got back in the house and she was like Oh its the north star But it was to the west and usually the star is north of where im at. Anyway, I showed her and then watched this bright light for about 10 more minutes and it just sat there. I checked online to see if there were any planets tonight visible and from what i came up with, Venus is supposed to be visible. So I was like cool, its Venus!! I went outside and looked at it a little while longer and didnt think much of it besides the fact that I thought it was a planet. Anyway, i just went out to look at it again and it WASNT THERE??? Its a clear sky tonight and if that wasnt a UFO, i have no idea what else it could have been.  Wish I would have watched it longer.  Didnt realize it was anything other then the planet I thought it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus.  PD));47.4827869565217;-122.280965217391
bright light travels over Seattle and seems to fade off into nothing.;2010-03-12 19:10:00;90 sec;bright light travels over Seattle and seems to fade off into nothing. Upon pulling into my driveway on the evening of March 12th, 2010, at approximately 7:10pm, I exited my truck and looked up into the sky as usual. I am an amateur stargazer so my eyes are always to the sky. As I looked to the North I noticed a bright light moving across the sky, I would say about 40 degrees or so off the horizon. It was moving from West to East, inside the atmosphere. No flashes, no strobing, just a single white light, much brighter than any stars in the sky. After watching for about 30 seconds, I had determined that is clearly not a plane or a satellite. I couldn't believe my eyes, I ran to the front door and got my mother. She couldn't believe her eyes. We continued to watch for about another minute as it seemed to travel in short spurts (like an inch across the sky to the naked eye, if that makes sense). It continued on and seemed as if it just suddenly got bright and seemed to be stationary for a brief second and then slowly faded away. While watching all this 2 planes passed into our sites, so we could easily compare them to an airplane. My mother also is a stargazer and we used to look for satellites in the sky together when I was a child. I am now 32 and she is 55. I am also a full-time college student (as well, as I just completed a quarter in Astronomy), part-time risk engineer assistant and a single mother of 2 toddlers. my mother is a registered nurse. We are both sober, intelligent adults. I guess you could consider my mother a skeptic, she was quite amazed and really could not give an explaination for what she saw, nor could I. I am far from a skeptic and have had other experiences in the past. This is the first time I've been able to share the phenomon with someone else. I hope someone else out there saw it too.;47.4827869565217;-122.280965217391
