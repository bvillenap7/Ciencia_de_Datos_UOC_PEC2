Silver craft, oblong saucer shaped.  There was only one. Standing on the hill at my condo looking east, (I lived on the hill overlooking Southcenter Mall.) it lowered and raised itself several times.   It was about a 100' long, I saw it very close one day.  It had a smoothly textured (looked like brushed aluminum) skin. At that time I had recently quit working at Boeing.  I worked there for 13 years. ((NUFORC Note:  We have reconsidered this case, and have finally elected to post it.  We do not know whether it was intended as a serious report.
