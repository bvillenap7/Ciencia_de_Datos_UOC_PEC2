Observed a strange orange light in the night sky.;2002-02-17 22:20:00;2 minutes;Observed a strange orange light in the night sky. On 02/1702 at approx. 22:20 hours Local time, I was on routine patrols when I noticed a strange orange/white light in the sky over Quincy, WA. ( a town about 30 miles west of Moses Lake). I assumed it was an aircraft in the flight pattern from Wenatchee to Moses Lake, however we do not have any scheduled flights after 20:30. Because the light looked out of place, I parked and began to watch it through a pair of 10X50 binoculars. When I did this, I noticed that the light seemed to be pulsating, going from a dimmer orangish then intensifying to a larger whitish. I wondered if the light was a yard light from a farm house somewhere on top of Monument Hill located just south of Quincy, WA. however I could clearly see the silouette of the tops of the hills, and this light was obviously higher than the hills. At first the light appeared to be stationary, but then it began to move slowly along the ridge of the hill towards the town of Ephrata, WA. It appeared to move along top of the ridge for about 1 minute and then stopped, began to desend towards the hill top. I noticed that the pulsating seemed to get brighter as it began to desend, as it neared the hill top, it was just like someone turned off a light switch. It just disappeared!! I sat there for about 20 more minutes searching the skyline thinking that maybe I just lost it behind a cloud,(it was overcast that night). After about twenty minutes, I spotted the light (or one just like it) about 20 miles to the west of where I saw it desend towards the ground, the light had the same characteristics as before as it seemed to be pulsating the orange/white light. It started to travel towards the west very slowly when it also just disappeared.END;47.1415999999999;-119.2894

Moving light and cone of light with flashes of lightning;2005-06-30 00:30:00;30 min;Moving light and cone of light with flashes of lightning About 12:30 in morning. At dirt-bike park near Moses Lake, Wa. Man and two 13 year old boys. Saw light, 3 times larger than star, moving erratically, often making right angle turns. About 30 degrees up in sky toward east. Watched it for about 30 minutes. Near end of this period cone of white light appeared, about 2 times as wide as moon from  vicinity of moving light to ground. Cone of light lasted a couple of minutes. Then what appeared to be 4 to 6 simultaneous streaks of lightning flashed in cone of light. No sound was heard. Sky was cloudless. With flashes of lightning, cone of light disappeared and moving light zipped away to right. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Traingle formation of lights in the night sky.;2007-07-28 22:20:00;2 minutes;Traingle formation of lights in the night sky. On Saturday, July 28, 2007, at approx. 22:20, I was sitting outside visiting with a friend. My friend was smoking a cigarette while I was sitting enjoying the summer evening.  Suddenly my eye caught what I thought was just a satellite. I soon realized that there was three of them traveling in an off set triangle. I immediately thought of the NOSS satellites, however one of them suddenly shot off! About the time I thought it couldn’t get any stranger, the other two stopped and just sat there!  While we were watching them just sit there, we noticed an opposite direction satellite go zooming by, not sure if it was related or not. The other strange thing is that a few moments later we noticed a military jet appear to be travelling towards their direction.  Since they were so dimly lit, and we never did see them start moving again, we eventually lost sight of them.  I have been a professional firefighter for almost 16 years, I think I have a pretty good idea about what is normal in the night sky as I have also worked in the aerospace industry (as a firefighter) so I know aircraft. The location of this sighting was directly over the Grant County International Airport, and was travelling in a southern direction.;47.1415999999999;-119.2894
Bright white light changes!;2008-05-02 23:00:00;10 seconds;Bright white light changes! I work in Moses Lake, WA at a large chemical plant and was working a rotating graveyard shift on Friday night, 05/02/2008. We were doing some routine work when I looked up towards the west and noticed a very bright white light moving very slowly from north to south. Normally I wouldn’t get excited about a light in the sky, but this particular light started out very dim, in fact the reason it caught my eye is because I thought it was a satellite, however that soon changed when it seemed to morph into a huge bright light about 10 times as bright and then back down to its original size. It did this several times before fading down to a pinpoint and then just like a light switch, poof it was gone!;47.1415999999999;-119.2894

I noticed a sudden flash of green light looking much like a shooting star in SW sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  PD));2015-11-16 22:12:00;<1 second;I was driving home and was coming down a side street when I noticed a sudden flash of green light looking much like a shooting star southwest of Moses Lake, Washington.  It lasted less than a second, I'm surprised I even saw it.  I thought maybe it was a firework at first but it appeared to be dropping and did not explode, it just simply disappeared.  It might be nothing, but I can't be too sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  PD));47.1415999999999;-119.2894
