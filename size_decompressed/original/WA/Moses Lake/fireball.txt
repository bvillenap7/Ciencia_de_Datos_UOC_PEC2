A round green flare dropped slowly from the sky and landed on the ground;2001-10-15 20:23:00;20 sec;A round green flare dropped slowly from the sky and landed on the ground We were driving heading west on I-90 in Moses Lake, Washington.  It was about 7:00 (?) and it was pitch black out, but very clear.  There were two of us in the front seat with another asleep in the back of the car.  A round green flare fell out of the sky.   It fell slowly enough for the two of us in the front seat to say what the heck is that?, wake up the passenger in back, have her sit up and watch it drop as well.  It didn't look like it dropped far from where we were - maybe a mile? ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness is alluding to the dramatic fireball seen over Puget Sound on Monday, 15OC01, at approximately 2023 hrs. (Pacific).  The exact time is known because the object was photographed with a sky camera in Courtenay, B.C..  We have changed the time here.  PD));47.1415999999999;-119.2894
Red fireball, silently  moving and hovering over our town.;2011-07-03 22:00:00;8 minutes;Red fireball, silently  moving and hovering over our town. I was taking pictures of fire works going off over our town and trained on a red fire ball thinking it was a fire work about to explode only it never exploded.   Instead the orb moved backwards, forwards toward me hovered, then moved over slowly and disappeared over the town with out any noise at all.   I have to say it was a little unnerving,  I even stopped taking pictures to try and process what I was seeing.   However the 4 pictures I did take are interesting.;47.1415999999999;-119.2894
Fireball;2011-08-12 21:00:00;2 minutes;I walked outside and saw a fireball type object in the sky, as low as a plane would be flying into to land at a local airport, however, it was not in the same position as a local airplane comin into to land.  The object was bright red, fireball.  It was moving to the right coming toward us.  After 30 seconds of the object coming toward us, it changed direction and shot out of sight.  This is the second time we have seen this in Moses Lake in the last month.;47.1415999999999;-119.2894
Not the typical meteor burning through the atmosphere. A huge fireball with a short tail.;2011-08-21 20:45:00;1 second;Not the typical meteor burning through the atmosphere. A huge fireball with a short tail. I saw a huge bright white fireball falling out of the sky.  From my location it was about 5 degrees west of North on my compas.  It was about the size of an outdoor flood light at 100â€™ away.  The length of the tail was only about 5 times the size of the ball.  It was visible for a little more than a second.;47.1415999999999;-119.2894
Light green meteor sighting near Airport;2017-10-12 13:24:00;3 seconds;Light green meteor sighting near Airport Light green meteor in Moses Lake Wa, 13:24 April 30, 2020. Direction facing was Northwest on Airway Drive NE, and Hillcrest Drive NE. Direction of object was North by North East.  Suggested angle was 35 degrees downward.  There was no curve downward, it was a linear angle. Object had a bright metallic, light green hue.  The best I can describe the color is in RGB : 212r 255b, 216g. The only chemicals I could think of that would burn green are copper sulfate, or boron with methanol compound. Concerned it went the direction of Grant County International Airport, would suggest contacting tower (509) 762 -5363. Also concerned that if it had a bright green hue, that it may contain the isotope Boron.;47.1415999999999;-119.2894
