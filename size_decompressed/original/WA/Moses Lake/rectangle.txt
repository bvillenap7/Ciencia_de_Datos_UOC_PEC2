Went outside to look at the stars.  I looked up and to my amazement there was a flying object that looked like a LED oblong light. Really high in the air, not as high as the stars, but seemed like it.  No sound that I could tell was from the object.  I saw it moving SW to NE. I ran in to get my camera, but it was too dark to take a picture, couldn't find the binoculars... So ran back out and it was still moving across the sky.  My husband was telling one of his customers about it and he was up getting ready for work, and saw it too.  Can't imagine what it was.  Maybe military...?;47.1415999999999;-119.2894
