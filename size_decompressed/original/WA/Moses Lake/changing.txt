3 blue/green lights (sometimes merged into one) moving absolutely silent across the sky from apx. west to east;1999-08-17 03:15:00;apx. 5 min.;3 blue/green lights (sometimes merged into one) moving absolutely silent across the sky from apx. west to east It was really hot and muggy that night and my husband and I went outside to cool off at around 3 am on Tuesday morning. We thought maybe we would see some of those meteors from the Perseid shower, but instead we seen an object that appeared to change from a bright green to a dimmer blueish green and then suddenly changed to 3 seperate lights that stayed in a triangle formation and after a few seconds rejoined to become one object again. We watched this object(s) for I'd say about 5 minutes. The object(s) made absolutely no sound. We have many aircraft fly over, since Japan Airlines trains their pilots here and we also have alot of military traffic and the occasional life flight chopper, all of which however make lots of noise and the blinking lights of those aircraft are unmistakable. As to what those silent lights in the nightsky could have been - your guess is as good as mine! Did you get any other reports about this from our area?;47.1415999999999;-119.2894
Recently I have noticed a very bright star in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus in the western sky.  PD));2018-07-10 22:00:00;45 minutes;Recently, I have noticed a very bright star in the sky and me and my fiance have argued over it being a star on the 4th of July on the 7th I'm sorry of this month my father-in-law told me that he thought it was Venus and I told both of them it was way too close to be either not last night but the night before which would be the 9th I kept looking at it and then when I was getting ready for bed I looked up and it was gone so last night I was out doing some things before I go into bed and I looked up at it and it moved very slightly not very roast is very slightly so I got my phone out and started recording it unfortunately the first recording that I took cuz I've got a new phone was deleted when I tried to turn on the second recording I do have the second recording of you are interested in the footage but this thing is very very bright and every time it would go to drop the light would get brighter and it would be longer I wasn't able to tell if it landed but, if you can no longer see it so in my opinion it did hit the ground it did go to the ground but if it did it would have been on the very edge of town or in town;47.1415999999999;-119.2894
