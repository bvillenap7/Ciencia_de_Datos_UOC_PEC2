large umbrella shape of a Strob light emitting a light every 5-8 seconds apart;1999-12-23 17:00:00;5 minutes;large umbrella shape of a Strob light emitting a light every 5-8 seconds apart We were driving on I90 to spokane for christmas and in the distance there was a bright strobe that when flashed it lit up the entire sky. At first i thought it was a tower, but continued to travel West towards us. It was about the size of your thumb nail (the strobe) as it flashed, couldnt see any shape to any craft.Which flew over our heads. couldnt tell the speed of travel because I was traveling 75 mph on the freeway. There was no red or green aircraft lights like I normally see which I mentioned to my wife.;47.1415999999999;-119.2894
many fast moving objects;2003-07-01 00:00:00;a few hours;many fast moving objects Me and my best friend used to sit on my drive way at night and relax on warm nights, and we used to see some strange stuff. (under 18 at time no alcohol or nothing was present) One night we saw things that appeared to be shooting stars. There had been a meteor shower earlier that summer so we thought nothing of it, but when we started paying attention we noticed that then would not be going in straight lines. It could have easily been one UFO flying back and forth, but literally for hours we sat and watched it(them) we didn't think of getting a telescope or camra, because they moved fast and irratically in a zig zag pattern. And left a trail for 3 to maybe 5 seconds. At one point there had to be at least 3 of them at once, and we'd see one easly every minute or 2. And come to think of it when I read you check list down there, its weird there were no planes around, considering I live in Moses Lake where there are military and Japanese passenger planes flying constantly thats quite odd even after dark especially in the summer.

small bright white light hovering near the airport and then left really fast clouse to the ground made no sounds;2009-04-20 23:30:00;12 minutes;small bright white light hovering near the airport and then left really fast clouse to the ground made no sounds i was leaving a gas station tring to beat midnight befor my gas voucher expired. when i got on stratford road i was stopped at a traffic light when i noticed a light above what seemed to be black eddition.  My first thought was that is was a airplane light in such an angle that it looked like one of what i call there head lights because it was in the direction of the airport were i am use to seeing touchdowns by JAL and i think now the Fairchild AFB who might have been here at that time.   As i was driving down stratford rd it was still there just  bee bopping around my next thought was maybe it was some sort of remote air craft but as i keep driving down stratford rd it seem to always be just ahead of me and if a remote it had pretty good.   AS i turned off stratford to Loring dr toward the base where i live (ex Larson AFB from the 60's).  This orb seem closer had just crossed the street for the second time was apx. above Basin Meats but seeem to  be hovering ! between there and the field as i drove down loring dr i stopped on the little hill before the road stated to wind and rolled down my window to look at it.   I couldn't see anything but light similar to a white head light not led but white.   Then i started to continue and after i got out of the curves in the road i looked back for the light again and could find it, then i noticed it in the direction of the airport.  From my distance the light was just below the lights of the airport flying fast under the lights and was gone again.  I dove down Patton Blvd got home and asked a friend at my house and her b-friend to come look for the light with me, they thought i was crazy and laughted plus it was too late we had to wake at 7am for work anyway. So that was it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));47.1415999999999;-119.2894
Intense blue light in grassy field;2010-03-06 11:00:00;10 seconds;Intense blue light in grassy field On March 6,2010, I was driving South on hwy 17.  This occurrence happened somewhere between Moses Lake and Othello (Washington).  I can't remember the exact location.  My Sister and I were on our way to Othello to pick up a dog that I had adopted. It was about 11:00 a.m..  As we were driving we were engaged in conversation.  On the left side of the road, approximately 50 feet in from the edge of the roadway, an incredibly intense blue light appeared.  The intensity was that of an arc welder, but  was about the size of a dumpster.  It had a distinct shape also. I continued talking to my Sister, but was mesmerized by this light.  As I got closer, it began to diminish, fade, and eventually vanished. All the while, I'm trying to process in my mind what light was.  I finished my sentence, then paused for a moment.  Then my Sister asked did you see that?  I replied the blue light?Yes! she said, what the hell was that?  I had no clue, but we both had seen it.  When we g! ot to where the light was, there was nothing but an empty field. A week later we were discussing it with my Sister's husband.  That's when I asked her if she noticed a shape of the light.  She drew a picture, and was almost identical to the one I had drawn. To this day, we still have no logical explanation of what we saw.  We can't exactly call it a UFO because it wasn't flying.  The intensity and shade of blue are beyond description.;47.1415999999999;-119.2894
