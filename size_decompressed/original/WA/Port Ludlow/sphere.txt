It was so unusual I ran outside onto the front porch in my bare feet to see it.   There was no sound, it was flickering orange, there were NO red/green port starboard light.  When it reached to the point of being overhead it slowly dimmed and disappeared.  A second one showed up following same track and also dimmed after passing overhead and disappeared.
