I ran out of the room to get the binoculars (gone less than 1 min.)and it was gone when I returned with them. Vantage point: The object was observed from 1 mile east of the shore and 1/2 mile north of Port Ludlow facing due east. Location: On the water north of Foul Weather Bluff which is the northern-most tip of the Kitsap Peninsula in Puget Sound. It was approximately 100 feet north of this Bluff. Shape: The shape of a bowl facing downwards on a small plate. Size: Approximately the size of 1/2 of the moon when seen very high in the sky. Another reference point is that it was approximately 1/2 to 2/3 the height of the bluff (Foul Weather Bluff) just south of it from sea level. Its width was approximately 3 times greater than its height. The fact that it was lit up was taken into consideration in estimating its size.  It appeared to be huge because of being lit up and with it's reflection on the water. Lighting: Lit up with diffuse light, not dissimilar from the moonlight. Another way of describing its lit-up appearance is that it was similar to the light coming from an off-white or light-beige light fixture. Both observers are professionals with advanced degrees (M.A and PhD), both have taught at the universities and have never seen anything like it.  My husband has remarkablely keen eyesight (20-15 range).;47.9191;-122.6894
