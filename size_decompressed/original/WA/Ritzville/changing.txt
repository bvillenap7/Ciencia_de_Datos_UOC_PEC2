2 crafts one heading north the other heading from north to south west while changing shape;2016-07-23 17:50:00;~3-5 minutes;2 crafts one heading north the other heading from north to south west while changing shape On Saturday July 23, 2016, 5:50 pm, my fiancé, my niece, and myself were heading home from downtown Ritzville.  Heading north on Columbia Ave., we just passed Alder Ave.  My niece had looked up to the right (east) and asked what that was in the sky.  I looked up and didn’t see anything at first.  As we approached Birch Ave.  I saw something moving in the sky. My fiancé parked the car at the apartments on east Birch and I grabbed my phone.  I aimed it towards the silvery white shape I saw in the sky to the east.  It had a weird shape to it almost reminding me of a cigar pointed at one end and flat at the other.  I snapped 2 pictures at approximately 5:52.  I looked at pictures and didn’t see anything at first.  As I zoomed in I found the items I was looking for.  It looks different in the picture almost block shaped.   This shape was moving in a south direction first.  It started to turn to a south west and finally west.  As I saw it turning I noticed another craft in the air with some sort of trail behind it.  It was silver in color and had a similar shape but heading north.  As I grabbed my phone to capture the north bound one it vanished.  I looked west saw the craft and then it was gone. I asked my niece what she had seen and she tried to explain it looked like a sideways cross but then it changed shape.  I hadn’t mentioned to her what I saw and she described a cigar type shape with a piece coming down from underneath.  I had her draw it for me.;47.1287;-118.3954
