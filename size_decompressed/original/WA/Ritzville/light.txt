7+ Ultra bright irregular blue light flashes.;2015-03-07 20:00:00;30 seconds;7+ Ultra bright irregular blue light flashes. We were on are way back from Towell Falls in Washington.  We just passed a large steel grain silo, when our car was surrounded by large ultra bright blue lights.  They would flash and disappear.  They didn't have a rhythm or pattern.  The length of their glow was irregular and changed with each flash.   Everyone in the vehicle saw them.  They were within feet of our car.   We were all confused and decided it was too weird to want to turn around and investigate.   I remember passing the silo earlier on our way to the falls.  There were no lights or light fixtures.;47.1287;-118.3954
