'cone-shaped mystery near Orion.;2014-02-03 20:00:00;1 hour;'cone-shaped mystery near Orion. My son (44 yrs. old) just called from Eastern Washington state to report a cone-shaped something with a head on it..  Enormous, above and to the right of Orion.  8 p.m. At 8:30 he called back to report this:  out-gassing cometary fragment ? gas fluoresced into greenish gas thought it might be aurora, but didn't move  He doesn't think now that it is/was a UFO.... but it was certainly a thrilling experience. A meteor would have been fiery.  Something blew up, or 'exhausted'?  We could not see it from Bellevue, WA, 200 miles west of him. Did anyone else see this?;47.1287;-118.3954
