String of 40-50 lights observed traveling west to east in the early morning sky. ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-19 05:45:00;10 minutes;String of 40-50 lights observed traveling west to east in the early morning sky My wife and I were leaving the hotel parking lot, getting into separate vehicles, and saying our goodbyes, when after a hug, my wife said, look at those lights in the sky. I turned around and looked up and noticed a string of lights moving west to east. At first she thought they were airplanes flying in a line, but looked more to me like they were much to high in the atmosphere to be planes. We watched for about 10 minutes, give or take, while a string of crafts moved across the sky. We could have seen anywhere between 40 to 50, maybe more, as they crossed the sky. The line of crafts came to an end, and we hit the road. There may have been more before we actually noticed them in the sky. we wouldn't have even noticed them if she hadn't been looking in the sky while we were hugging each other goodbye. They looked just like the rest of the stars in the sky. my wife tried to video the objects, but they were too faint to capture.;47.1287;-118.3954
