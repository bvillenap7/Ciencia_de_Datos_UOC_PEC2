Object  with red lights around it, going on for about 2 seconds and off for about 2 seconds, about 50 feet up and 30 feet away from car;2005-04-08 21:15:00;1 to 2 minutes;Object  with red lights around it, going on for about 2 seconds and off for about 2 seconds, about 50 feet up and 30 feet away from car My Husband and myself and our grandson were Heading west on I-90, out of the corner of my eye I saw something red come on and go off, we were going about 65 miles an hour, so it was hard to tell if the object was moving. I saw a solid flash of red that that went completely around the object and would stay on for about 2 seconds then go off and then come on again after about 2 seconds, I saw this object outside my window, about 50 feet up and 30 feet away from the car.  When the red lights came on I could see the bottom of the object and it was shaped round. When the red lights went off I couldn't see the object at all, only when the red lights came on, was I able to see it. There was no sound from the object. I have never seen anything like it before.  When I told my husband to pull over, so I could watch it, by the time we got pulled over it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witnesses, and they sounded to us to be quite credible.
