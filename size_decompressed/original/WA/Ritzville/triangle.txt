triangular shaped object  that had a bright blue/purple light that flashed;2004-11-08 20:00:00;5-10 minutes;triangular shaped object  that had a bright blue/purple light that flashed My friends and I were on our way to Spokane, heading east on I-90 when we noticed a triangular shaped object that had a bright blue/purple light that flashed. It kind of hovered around for several minutes and woulld change direction. As we drove away from it, it continued to hover behind us until we finally lost sight of it. When we first sighted it, only a couple of us were convinced it was a UFO. We all thought, what the heck is that! but it wasnt until after it was out of sight that we all agreed it was definitely not an airplane.;47.1287;-118.3954
