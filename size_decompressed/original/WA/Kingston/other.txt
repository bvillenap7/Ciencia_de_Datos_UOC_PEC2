Blimp, plane or what was that overhead one moment and disappeared the next.;2015-08-19 19:55:00;5 seconds;Blimp, Plane or what was that overhead one moment and disappeared the next. I was driving East on NE Country Woods Lane at about 15 miles per hour.  I observed an aircraft that may have been a blimp about 200' above the ground that looked similar to an airbus 320 but was much shorter in length and much wider in diameter, more like a pregnant guppy shape.  It seemed to be traveling directly South at about a speed of 35 miles per hour. Within a few seconds of observing it--it went out of my sight because of large trees blocking my view.  I continued East for about 5 seconds and my sight was no longer obscured and the floating object was not there at all.  From this point of view I could see over 1500 feet and my vision was unimpaired all the way from the East thru directly South to the West. The sky was totally blue skies at that time except for one small white cloud visible to me directly where I had extrapolated the object would be, factoring in its apparent speed and direction. If anyone in the immediate area was looking up they should have easily seen the object.;47.8108;-122.5255
