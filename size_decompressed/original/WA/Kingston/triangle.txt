Two lighted black triangles North of Kingston, WA;2010-08-13 22:25:00;5 minutes;Two lighted black triangles North of Kingston, WA   On Friday August 13, 2010   I was watching meteor showers in my yard when I noticed two unusual objects in the sky. The objects were triangular in shape, vertical with the apex pointing straight up. Inside the triangles were undulating white, green and red lights that morphed around inside the triangles like colored bubbles inside a lava lamp.  Each triangle was about the size of a dime at armâ€™s length. Initially the triangles passed from the south toward the north in a somewhat horizontal path and stopped due east about 45 degrees above the horizon.  At the same time I saw an airplane pass in front of the triangles and then I saw a satellite pass over them. They were bigger than the jet airliner so they must have been at least 100 feet on a side. The objects were distinctly different from either the airliner or the satellite. The objects were about as high as the plane and beyond it a ways.  Once the triangles stopped, they slowly moved around in the sky, up, down and sideways with no particular pattern to their movements.  At times they hovered nearly still in their positions and then they would resume their dance.  The objects were never touching and did not remain adjacent to one another.   Eventually they started moving directly upward.  The triangle on the right stayed in position lower than the one on the left. As I watched the objects ascend, a deer entered my yard and startled me.  When I looked back, I could no longer see them.;47.8108;-122.5255
