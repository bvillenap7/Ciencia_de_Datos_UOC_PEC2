An unusual white light blinked randomly in the sky close to the star Arcturis at first glance I thought it was a high flying military jet with it's lights blinking at an unusual rate but it just loitered in the same area. The light would blink brightly on and off from the same location. Then I would see nothing until it faded back into sight with the intensity of a bright star (as bright as Venus) but very focused in intensity as if a giant spotlight was pointed downwards. It glowed for about 4 seconds with an intensity similar to a bright white halogen light but very powerfull since it appeared the object was very high. I got the impression it was very high up but I was unable to tell for sure how high. My first impression of the altitude was about 40,000 or more.  10 minutes later in the same direction a spotted a fast moving ball of light that shot across the sky from the east to the west. It was visible for only a  a second. It went the speed of a slower meteorite but showed none of the common characteristics such as  breaking up in the atmosphere and changing colors and flickering until it fades. This object had a white glow with a hint of green and blue but it happened so fast I can't totally be sure of the precise color. I am very sure this was not a shooting star because it's size would have created a fireball of some form it was very even in Luminescence and seemed to be unaffected by the atmosphere or was up too high for any air friction.;47.8108;-122.5255
