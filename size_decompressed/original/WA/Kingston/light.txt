One object consisting of 1 large and 2 small bright white lights flew over road at very low altitude.;1999-10-20 22:35:00;3 seconds;One object consisting of 1 large and 2 small bright white lights flew over road at very low altitude. Driving north on rural road lined by tall fir trees/woods on each side.  Saw what appeared at first to be a shooting star go over the road in a straight path (no arc) east to west, but extremely low (500 ft?)  Consisted of one large, very bright white light with 2 smaller white lights. No sound.  Few houses near road fairly secluded area.  Pulled off at clearing, unable to see anything further.  I am an R.N.  I have had two previous sightings as a child.  My daughter was driving another car ahead of me and it appeared to be a large fireworks to her (she was not wearing her glasses).  It appeared much too large to be a fireworks to me, nor did it arc as it would have needed to to be launched over the trees.;47.8108;-122.5255
A light was sitting in one spot in the sky and then started zig zagging away, then dissappeared.;2001-06-01 22:30:00;5 minutes;A light was sitting in one spot in the sky and then started zig zagging away, then dissappeared. it was kind of like a thin diamond of light that looked like it was spinning and flashing different colors, and it was really bright.  It sat in the same spot for about 2 minutes and then started moving slowly towards the left, but it wasn't moving in a straight line, it was zig zagging a little bit.  I watched it move for a minute or more, and then it went behind a tree, so I moved over but it was gone.;47.8108;-122.5255
Super fast bright light parallel to ground, below tree level, 10 miles away - or shooting star much farther away?;2001-09-14 05:21:00;1 second;Super fast bright light parallel to ground, below tree level, 10 miles away - or shooting star much farther away? I was outside and just happened to be looking West up in the sky. The sky was clear, and since the sun had not risen yet there were still plenty of stars out. I would bet money that what I saw was actually a meteorites but it seemed very low and it streaked across the sky at a horizontal attitude. My first thought is that if was a UFO, it was over the hood canal or Jefferson County, not more than 10 miles away. It looked just like a star. If it really was 10 miles away, then I would estimate its speed at several thousand miles per hour. It was below the tree line, and visible for not more than one second due to the trees. There was an optical/visual streak effect, because it was going so fast. It was different looking than the average shooting star effect -It was not leaving a dust trail in its wake. I know that sometimes meteorites are much much farther away than they look, which could explain why this one was visible to me going across the sky on a horizontal path. It was going South to North. I'm only reporting this because I'm hoping somebody on Whidbey Island or Vancouver BC saw the same thing come their way and maybe saw more than one seconds' worth of it. I've seen a lot of shooting stars before, but never any running parallel to the earth, you know? I dunno, I suppose it could happen - let me know what you think.;47.8108;-122.5255

Red very slow pulsating light;2010-07-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;We were departing the ferry when I looked off to the south sky and noticed a red very slow pulsating light approx. 3000 feet up.  I told my wife ( former flight attendant ) who was equally surprised at how odd this pulsating light was.  As we walked we both noticed another couple that was looking at it about 20 feet ahead of us.  They were both very excited stating that they had never seen anything like it - we all just stood there and stared at it as it slowly ascended - straight up - not across the horizon, it became smaller and smaller in size and eventually became just a pin-point tiny little red pulsating light and then gone.   We all looked at each other amazed and all agreed that we had seen something unusual - this was a  really strange event, one that my wife and I are still talking about today.;47.8108;-122.5255
