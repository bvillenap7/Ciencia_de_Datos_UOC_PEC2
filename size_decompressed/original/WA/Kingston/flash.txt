Unexplained Bright Stationary Flash of Light Kingston WA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));2013-10-28 20:17:00;1 second;Unexplained Bright Stationary Flash of Light Kingston WA Date: 10/28/2013 TIME: 20:17 PDT Country: United States	 State: Washington City: Kingston Sighting:  Unexplained Bright Stationary Flash of Light I had just put the dogs into the house after our evening walk.  I live in a rural area (itâ€™s very dark) and often gaze up at the sky and practice picking out constellations or stars.  I have done this almost all my life and I have never seen anything that I could not explain outright.   On Monday October 28th at approximately 08:17 PM PDT I was facing SW and at around 70 degrees above the horizon just above some tall fir trees I saw a bright light turn ON like a flashlight in the sky then turn off approximately 1 or 2 seconds later.  It was not moving.  It was approximately 7 to 10 times brighter than the stars around it and most certainly not an aircraft light.  It may have been 3 times the size of the closest star.  I waited and it occurred again approximately 2 minutes later. Although a dull sighting, it was odd enough to me that I figured if someone else saw it and was hesitant to report it they might see my report and add a corroborating report.  I noticed a similar report in Kennewick on 10/20/2013. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));47.8108;-122.5255
