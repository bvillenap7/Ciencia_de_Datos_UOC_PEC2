Glittering small lights changing from red to blue to green, moving in erratic circles and lines, two days in a row.;2005-09-08 05:00:00;hour;Glittering small lights changing from red to blue to green, moving in erratic circles and lines, two days in a row. I returned home from work to and noticed a very bright light in the sky.  I thought it might have been a planet, possibly Venus, but it was glittering a variety of colors ranging from bright red to green to blue to yellow.  It was obviously not an airplane because it didn't appear to be moving.  As I watched it, I noticed it would occasionally move up and down or left and right or in small ovals, very rapidly and sporratically but not in any intelligble direction, it seemed very erratic.  I woke my sister and she watched it with me.  It was to the East just right of the little dipper.  We watched it for an hour and I took photos and some video.  It was still visible and was still moving as it became light out, and I took a video showing the only two objects still visible in the sky were this object and Mars.  While it was still dark out we noticed a number of shooting stars.  The next day, at the same time, I noticed three of the same objects making the same motions, not close to each other, about 20 degrees left or right of each other.  They all appeared nearly identical, possibly at different distances from me this time.  My sister saw them also.;45.916;-122.4558
