She looked toward the north and noticed something and brought it to my immediate attention.  The object was a bright glowing red light with what seemed to be two yellow or orange colored lights that would fade into the red light from both sides suggesting that they were outer lights that were rotating around the bright red light.  The object moved in an eastbound direction for about three to four (3-4) minutes, then stopped and hovered in place for about another minute or two, then moved toward the northeast into clouds and faded into the clouds which took about another minute.  No further visual of it was seen after.  During the time of us witnessing the sighting, we heard no sounds.  We also called her son outside who also witnessed it moving into the clouds.;45.5959;-122.3104
Oscillating, vibrating craft over wooded neighborhood.;2015-03-25 20:00:00;7 minutes;Oscillating, vibrating craft over wooded neighborhood. While sitting in the living room with my children, the whole house started vibrating at a low frequency, with a low oscillating effect.   I walked to the window to see, but the sky was cloudy and I could see nothing.  I placed my hands on the window as it was visibly vibrating.  I opened the window and the sound grew much louder, it felt right on top of the house.   We walked outside in the backyard and looked, but could see nothing except twilight sky and cloud.  The sound very slowly moved away in a northern direction. I checked the flight plans of the closest airport, Portland International, and only one flight was scheduled from Seattle to Portland, nowhere near the vicinity.;45.5959;-122.3104
