Red light in sky, in evening, stayed in place for 15 to 20 minutes.;1976-09-01 22:00:00;20 minutes;Red light in sky, in evening, stayed in place for 15 to 20 minutes. It was the evening and I was returning home.  Upon returning home I noticed a red light in the sky at the end of the street.  It was a dead end street, and we lived in the boondocks!!  It was dark and the light just hung in the sky.  I watched it for some time, then went into the house and got my brother in-law and mother.  We watched for some time, then my brother dismissed it as a plane.  It did not move, it stayed in one spot.  I do not, to this day, believe it was a plane.

bright light approaching form the north;2001-03-16 01:35:00;10-12 seconds;bright light approaching form the north I was lying in bed trying to go to sleep( I am an insomniac) and staring out the window next to the bed, when I saw a light in the sky approaching from the north, and headed south. I saw that it did'nt appear to be an airplane, as it had no blinking lights nor was it making any sound.(I sleep with the window partially open, so I'd have been able to hear engine sounds)It was no more than 400' above the house. As I watched it, and I wondered at what I was seeing, It stopped, hovered for a moment, then suddenly shot off at a 45 degree angle to the east at a high rate of speed.;45.5959;-122.3104
Light flashing really bright, reappearing then flashing again and not moving in normal aviation flight form.;2013-07-14 22:57:00;7 seconds;a light flashing really bright, reappearing then flashing again and not moving in normal aviation flight form. My husband and I were standing outside tonight 7/14/2013 around 10:57 pm.   I was looking into the sky due north and I saw a big flash like a light bulb lasted only a second then it was gone then a few seconds later a little to the right there was  a smaller flash that lasted a second then disappeared.  I said to my husband, Did you see that,  and before I could finish my question, he was asking me if I saw it.  He explained it as what looked like a bright porch-light lit up super bright then disappeared, than lit up again, went off into the distance then disappeared for good.  We stood there for a few moments but nothing reappeared.;45.5959;-122.3104

It had a bright light was far enough away to be the same size as the star behind it.  It turned and became red.. but then it turned again and came back.. I thought it was an illusion but it stopped moving.  Then it turned red and came back the opposite direction.  Then it stopped and went back and then went back again.  It was not an airplane or helicopter. It moved very fast and turned in 360 degree angles and then it went down behind the trees.  What is odd is that it was extremely far away then close then far then when it went straight down it was close enough to look like it was less than 10 miles away.
