Three extremely large lights hanging above nearby trees.;1976-10-10 20:30:00;1 minute;Three extremely large lights hanging above nearby trees. It was the evening and I and a friend were driving home from a meeting.  We have a big hill to drive up to get to the house.  As we were driving up the hill, we noticed three huge lights hanging above the trees off to the left of us.  The site distance from us was no more than a couple thousand feet.  The lights hung about 500 feet above the trees.  I was curious about what they were, my friend was frightened and just wanted to get to the house.  When we arrived at the house and looked down the hill the lights were gone.  I did not hear any noises.  They just hung there.  They seemed huge, like the size of a football field.  This still amazes me to this day.  I have no doubt that these things are out here. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));45.5959;-122.3104

It stayed like that for about 5 mniutes, my mom had previously seen it in Vancouver, WA and called me at 5:45 am after it had vanished.  It later began to slowly get smaller to the size of a tiny star it grew slightly vanished, grew slightly and vanished multiple times.  Then it was gone.  I have no idea what it was I've never seen something that big in the sky or that bright before either.;45.5959;-122.3104
