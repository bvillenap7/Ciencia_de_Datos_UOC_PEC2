It moved like a shooting but was far too large.  did anyone else see this?  I saw something similiar a few  months ago.;45.5959;-122.3104
50 lighted objects evenly spaced moving through sky over Washougal WA  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-16 21:00:00;10 minutes;50 lighted objects evenly spaced moving through sky over Washougal WA My husband and I along with two nearby neighbors noticed a string of lighted objects evenly spaced traveling through space.  Planes were coming over our home on path to PDX these were higher than the planes.  All moving at the same speed. We saw two large bright lights stationary with a red flashing light as well.;45.5959;-122.3104
