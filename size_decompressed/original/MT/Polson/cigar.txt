Unusual looking metallic craft over the National Bison Range in Montana.;2010-07-23 12:30:00;10 seconds;Unusual looking metallic craft over the National Bison Range in Montana. My friend and I were traveling in the beautiful National Bison Range near Sanders, Montana, (between Missoula and Kalispell).   We snapped this picture (sending via email).   Only on closer inspection of this photograph did we notice what appears to be a craft.   We had to share. ((NUFORC Note:  Photos shows gray, blurry object.  We do not know what it is, but it may be a bird in flight.  PD));47.6861;-114.1324
