BRIGHT GREEN LIGHT STREAKING DOWNWARD WITH TAIL, ABNORMALLY FAST TO RIGHT OF NEARLY FULL MOON.;2015-11-24 21:20:00;light streak;BRIGHT GREEN LIGHT STREAKING DOWNWARD WITH TAIL, ABNORMALLY FAST TO RIGHT OF NEARLY FULL MOON. In the evening of 11/24/15, I was unloading my pickup at apprx.9:20 pm, when I saw a bright large full  emerald green light streak downward extremely fast to the right just to the right of an almost full moon which was extremely brilliant and huge.  I do not believe it was a meteor, because it as so wide in the front but have never seen that before in my 75 year old life.  I am a real estate broker of 37 years, {still working} and often go to my cabin which faces Flathead Lake and is located in the Mission Mtns just North of Polson, Mt.  I would also like to speak to someone directly about a grouping of  unusual orbs which I photographed  with a big Canon camera {would be happy to send you the photos} when an unusual incident happened while I was picking berries last summer,  We all in the neighborhood,  feel for some reason that our area is extremely magnetic.    Last year I had lightning strike three giant fir trees all at once just about 30 ft from the end o! f my cabin in October...highly weird, all I heard was thunder for a moment and then almost like an explosion.  When Istepped outside, there was wood for over 200 feet clear aross and to the end of my lawn.  Bizarre, blew up my computer in the house even though it was off and had a surge protector, which also blew up.;47.6861;-114.1324

It was too big and too bright to be a star or planet.  There was only one.   We live out in the country, and I was just looking out at the lights of town in the distance.  There it was in the sky.  At the time it appeared in the middle of my window.  By the time I woke my husband to see it, it was in the top portion of the window.  Then it was gone.;47.6861;-114.1324
30+ lights first three were in a triangle formation and then went into a straight line followed by the others all in a straight line. T;2020-09-17 05:34:00;7 minutes;30+ lights first three were in a triangle formation and then went into a straight line followed by the others all in a straight line. They weren't evenly spaced but they came in groups of two or more. Moved across the sky from west to east.   No sound but you could see a slight flicker of each light.;47.6861;-114.1324
