On July 14th, approx. 9:30 pm, my dogs started barking like i have never heard them bark,   I turned off the radio, and opened the window, which then I heard a sound that i have never heard, at first i thought it was a very large aircraft flying very low, but the sound was different,  so i went outside to look for it,i saw nothing, but the sound persisted, it also sounded like the rushing of a lot of air, with a droning very loud sound, then it just stopped.  i saw nothing ,i mentioned it to a friend across the valley to the east over by the Mission Mountains, at first she thought the same thing as me but saw nothing.;47.6861;-114.1324
