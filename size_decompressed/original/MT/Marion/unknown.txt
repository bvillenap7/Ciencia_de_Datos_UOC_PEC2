Woke at 4:30 - looked at stars - towards Southeast from Little Bitterroot Lake - Saw one very bright one but noticed it was blinking colors. Woke husband, went to window with binoculars and we both watched it in sky for 25 minutes - rapid blinking red and blue light, also appeared to have white light shining up.  About 30 degrees up from horizon.  Maybe a helicopter?  But not shining a light down (as in search light) and no noticeable movement.  Stayed in same place in sky for over 30 minutes.  Could not discern shape - just looked like very bright star.   After 30 minutes, dimmed and between 4:55 and 5:05 it got higher in sky. Could be helicopter tracking bear???  We were visiting Montana at approx  48-07-30  by  114 45 00 (homeowner has map) and light was southeasterly - towards Mount Marion.;48.0836;-114.7446
