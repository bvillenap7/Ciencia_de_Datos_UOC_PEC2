It turns out my friend saw it as well. We just had dinner a couple of hours ago (thursday night) and it turns out that he was still outside after I dropped him off, and he saw it too! We had commented on it, and noted how we had neither seen anything like it before. After listening to Peter on the Art Bell's show tonight, I had to take the time to contact you, and report that what had to be the same object described on the show, was visable from here on the head waters of the missouri river, between Butte and Bozeman, in south central Montana sunday night, by two more witnesses. It was truely an amazing bright white light, with a bluest-green aura or haze around the center. We both talked about how it looked like an arc welder. Anyways, if you want any more info, please feel free to call me. It was simply amazing. ((name deleted));45.8848;-111.5441
