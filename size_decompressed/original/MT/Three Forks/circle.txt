Strange movement of circular lights.;2013-09-25 05:17:00;45 minutes;strange movement of circular lights I live in clarkston  went outside to my car, something caught my eye  I looked up and seen a light moveing.  at first I thought it was a radio tower cuz there are three in that area but while I was looking at it it moved from hill to hill and no cars could be there.  It just kept zig zagging back and fourth.  I grabbed my phone and recorded it.  not a great pic but no red and green lights like a plane would have white orange.  could be anything but I've never seen anything move like that ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
