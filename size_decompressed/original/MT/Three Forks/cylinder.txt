IT WAS A LONG CYLINDER WITH A LONG TYPE OF CONE SHAPED TAIL. IT WAS GLOWING WHITE BUT NOT EMITTING LIGHT. IT WAS FLYING AT APPROX. AT 8:10,000 FEET AT A VERY FAST SPEED. IT DIDN'T LEAVE ANYKIND OF TRAIL. IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY KIND OF WINGS OR STABLISER THAT I COULD SEE. IF THE MOON WAS FULL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER ACROSS THAN THE MOON IS WIDE. IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY KIND OF ANTI-COLLISION LIGHTS. I WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS AS LONG AS A FOOTBALL FIELD. I WAS IN THE USAF FOR 15 YEARS AND HAVE ALL KINDS OF ACFT FLY AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.;45.8848;-111.5441
