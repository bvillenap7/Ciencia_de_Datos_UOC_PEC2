Bluish light rises into one of three spheres that forms a triangle and hovers.;2015-03-21 21:00:00;2 minutes;Bluish light rises into one of three spheres that forms a triangle and hovers As we were driving from Hamilton to Darby, we were about 7 miles away from Darby, and to the East, over the Sapphire Mountains, I saw three orange/pink orbs that formed a triangle and seemed to be hovering, not moving.   At first I thought maybe they were part of some electrical towers until I saw a bluish white orb-like light that looked like it was rising into the bottom sphere (then I couldn't see that bluish light anymore), and then the bottom sphere rose up and disappeared until only two orbs of the triangle were visible.   My mother-in-law looked over as the first disappeared and saw the two remaining orbs.  Then one of those two orbs disappeared, and the last orb finally flew away north.
