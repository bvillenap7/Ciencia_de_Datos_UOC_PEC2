Saucer shaped object near Trapper Peak.  Emailing photo.;2016-10-08 17:24:00;photo only;Saucer shaped object near Trapper Peak. Emailing photo. October 8th, 2016 around 5pm MDT, I went to Hannon Memorial Fishing Access South of Darby, MT.  Trapper Peak looked nice so I took several pictures of it.  A few minutes later, in the shade, I was going through the pics to see what might be best and deleting poor ones. I noticed what I thought was a bird in one of the pictures and zoomed in to see what it was.  To me it looked like a flying hard hat (only much larger) several miles away.  I posted it to FaceBook and said I would zoom in and crop the picture later that evening. I did not see the object when taking the pictures, it wasn’t until a bit later that I noticed it in the photo. When I got home, I looked at the pictures on my Galaxy S4 phone. On that particular picture, I hit edit, then crop.  I zoomed in on the original to the spot in question then slid the crop outline over there and saved the “cropped” image.  I posted it to Facebook. Next, I took the “cropped” picture (which now had a .png extension) and did the same thing, zoom, crop and save.  I did it a third time and Posted both of these to FaceBook.  To me it looks like some kind of flying saucer. I have the original picture on my camera (.jpg extension).  Clicking on the “details” button, it shows the date, time and sequence number of the picture. I will email the original picture to the address given along with my FaceBook address.  If someone wants to verify the picture, I’d be happy to show them. ((NUFORC Note:  Photo shows an amorphous, blurry, dark object above a distant ridge.  We cannot confirm that the object is a genuine UFO.  Moreover, we suspect that the object, because of its asymmetry, may be a bird in flight.  PD));46.0337;-114.1921
