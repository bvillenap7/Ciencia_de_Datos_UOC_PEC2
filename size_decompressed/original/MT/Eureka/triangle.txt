I am missing one hour of time.;2008-09-15 05:30:00;1 hour;I am missing one hour of time. I reported a triangular shaped object with lights that went from bright to dim to diminishing and relocating around the craft. A very large craft. It happened during a lightning storm. That was nearly 3 years ago. Since then I have not made any reports or seen any other objects. Although I have had a experience on 9/15/2008 at exactly 0533 hours. I set my alarm and woke at 0445 hours. I showered then packed my bags for a long work trip to Oregon. I noticed the time after I got out of the shower and it was 2 minutes after 0500. I loaded the vehicle and finished making my morning diet drink and went to the car to leave. What happened next was very weird. It was 0633 in the morning. I got very angry that I was late and made several calls on my cell phone immediately to make sure it was really 0633 the time on the cars clock. It really was 0633. It took me several 11 days to figure this all out. I got home from my work trip and went to my alarm clock to see the time on it (battery Operated) It was on time exactly and the alarm was set to 0445. I don't remember walking to the vehicle that morning to leave only that I was looking at the clock and feeling angry that my alarm clock had let me down. It never has in the past. I am missing one hour of time. I was alone.;48.8472;-115.0051
