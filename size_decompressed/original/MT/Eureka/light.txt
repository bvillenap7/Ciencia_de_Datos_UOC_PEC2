Three lights to begin with. One light on one side and one light on an opposite side. Each light would pulsate and change colors but did not change distance. A third light would somewhat appear in between the other lights but would fade in and out at times and would not be a constant or timed light. The light would move at a very slow speed in a southwesterly direction and would slow pulse and change colors. A very dim out line of the object seemed to make a V. There was no noise at all. The lights were directly over our house. Once they started a move in a southwesterly direction the speed and intensity of the lights seemed to increase and before the object made a  departure the lights came together and then went apart to the distance it originally started at and then the departure was  white light and then it very swiftly left heading west and climbing in altitude.;48.8472;-115.0051
