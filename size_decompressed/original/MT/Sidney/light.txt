2 stationary orange balls of light over Sidney, MT, in the night sky.;2015-06-28 23:30:00;1 minute;2 stationary orange balls of light over Sidney, MT, in the night sky. I'm a truck driver and had just got off work at 11:30 mountain time.  I was walking to my vehicle when I looked up into the crystal clear sky and saw two very deep orange balls of light in the sky.  They both looked to be high up in altitude and in fixed positions not moving.  One was high up in the sky and one was down closer to the horizon.   I watched them for about 40 seconds then the lower orange ball went from a complete stand still to zipping all the way across the sky horizontally till it disappeared within 3 seconds.  10 seconds later, the orange light ball that was higher up in the sky faded and disappeared.;47.712;-104.1624
