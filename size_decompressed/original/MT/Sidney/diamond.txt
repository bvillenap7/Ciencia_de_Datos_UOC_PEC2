4 glowing lights in diamond formation speed across sky and dissappear.;2013-10-08 22:15:00;5 seconds;4 glowing lights in diamond formation speed across sky and dissappear 4 separate glowing lights sped across the sky extremely fast, in the shape of a diamond.   The lights moved far faster than any regular aircraft could go.   There was no sound and none of the lights flashed at any time.   They just glowed very bright. they disappeared behind a tree and I could locate the lights anywhere in the sky after that, even after walking to where I could see behind the tree.
