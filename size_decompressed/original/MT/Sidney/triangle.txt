Triangle or V of lights traveling fast and low with no sound at all.;1991-07-15 22:00:00;3-4 Seconds;Triangle or V of lights traveling fast and low with no sound at all. I was laying on my back in the backyard watching for meteors when suddenly I saw a triangle or V of lights travel from south to north at a very high rate of speed. I estimate that the craft was less than 1,000 feet in altitude but it made absolutely no sound. The lights were yellow/white in the center and red on the outside. The lights were on the sides or wings of the triangle but not on the base. There were about six or seven lights in all. It was a large object, about the size of a B-52 flying at that altitude. I did not see any surface features, all I could make out were the lights. I was laying between two houses so I only saw the craft for about 3 or 4 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
