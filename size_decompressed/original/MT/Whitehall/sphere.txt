My 13 yr old daughter first noticed a medium sized aqua colored brightly glowing sphere shape at 19:15 in our horses pasture out about 40-50 yards from our house. It came straight down and looked like it touched the ground and then disappeared. No noise could be heard...nothing...it appeared out of no where and disappeared as quickly as it appeared. About 21:00 I went out to look and see if there was anything in the sky or in the pasture as our outside dogs were barking. I noticed off in the distance what appeared as some sort of a sparkling blueish-green, yellow, red shape hovering over our town. I called my daughter and we both stood there in the window watching the almost star like looking object (same color my daughter reported seeing) flicker in color as if the colors were going around the shape and twinkling. It was very noticeable to the naked eye that they were colors and what ever it was was stationary. Over to the right and out and up from our past! ure in the sky was a amber/redish looking glowing object as well. This one did not flicker or change colors. It remained a redish glow. Both objects are above our town...not as far out as a star....but distinguishable with the naked eye. Not really sure what it could be other than a UFO possibly. I would love to know if anyone else reported it.;45.8738;-112.1279
