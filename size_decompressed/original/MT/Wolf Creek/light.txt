Bright flashing object, bright lights following.;2014-11-26 00:30:00;45 seconds;Bright flashing object, bright lights following. I was driving along HWY-434, heading towards Wolf Creek, MT.  All of a sudden there is a bright tan flashing light that happens over the passenger front side of my hood.   Thinking that I was going to hit a deer, I slammed on my brakes briefly, but the flashing persists for longer than it should have, approx. 100 feet.  I cannot make out what it is.   As I continue driving, two very bright lights appear in my rearview mirror.  The lights are an odd color, white/red/blue but never one color at a time.   This section of road has hills and turns and the lights seem to be staying behind me.   At first, I thought it was a combine (farming machine), and then I thought I was getting pulled over, but then realized that I never lost sight of the lights around the hills and turns.   The lights stay the same distance from each other and stay in my mirror for about three minutes.  I got scared, stopped looking and drove way too fast to notice if they were still behind me.   I did not pass a single person on the road that night.;47.0871;-112.1524
