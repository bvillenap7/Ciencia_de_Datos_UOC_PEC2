Then saw a light in the sky focused on it and it appeared to be some kind of ship.  As the clouds went by it never moved.  I was so excited that when I focused on it it was a saucer with a round light lite underneath it that was round. It just sat there at first thinking it may be a bright star.  Not even knowing if at my home at 6000 feet up if it was possible to see a star in the day time.  But with the binoculars even though only 10 time magnification I still wanted to make sure I was just not seeing what I thought I was seeing.  So I layed on the ground found the saucer again I layed there on the dirt driveway for over 3 hours.  To the point my elbows even though on the ground were getting pretty sore.I would look away then go right back and there it was.  Then the clouds getting ready to rain and being very dark.  I thought great now I will lose it.  I keeped watching and it was there under the clouds at this point all thoughts of a star or some form of goverment craft went away.  It was so windy out that if it had been anything I believe we have it would have been blowing around up there.  It never moved.  The light stayed on even in the bright daylight.  I have to say I believe it was watching me watching it.  Just a feeling I was getting.  This was no big giant craft not a triangle no flashing lights the one light just stayed fixed on.  It was the size of a truck maybe a little bigger but not much.  It was awesome . ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));47.0871;-112.1524
