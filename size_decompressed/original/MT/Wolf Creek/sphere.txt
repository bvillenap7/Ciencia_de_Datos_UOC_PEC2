Light brown sphere found in the background of a photograph taken in the Montana mountains while on horseback.;2011-09-01 10:25:00;short;Light brown sphere found in the background of a photograph taken in the Montana mountains while on horseback. I was on a horseback ride with a group of other guests in Montana.  We left our guest ranch and were riding in and on the mountains. I was taking photographs of the scenery throughout the ride.  When I returned to California from my vacation, I downloaded my photos into my computer.  On one photo, I observed this blurred sphere object in the sky.  It was light brown in color and appeared to be some distance away.  At first I thought something must have been on my camera lens however, when I reviewed the photos that followed, there was nothing present.  Then, I thought it might be a bird, but when I magnified the photo times 800, it was still round.   I have no idea what was in that photo. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photo provided by the witness, and the object is a small, blurry, brown smudge in the photo.  From the information provided, we cannot conclude that it is a genuine UFO.  We suspect that it may be a bird or insect in flight.  PD));47.0871;-112.1524
