Ball of light in Wolf Point Montana May 21, 1997;1997-05-21 04:00:00;5 minutes;Ball of light in Wolf Point Montana May 21, 1997 I was lying in my bed, very much awake, looking out the window at 4 am on May 21, 1997 in Wolf Point Montana. I was flying out on an airplane at 6 am, ready to leave. I saw a ball of light out the windown and thought it was an airplane going over. I kept watching it, just observing it. The ball of light came toward me, getting bigger and bigger. I kept watching it. There was no noise. It kept getting bigger till it was about 7 or 8 feet across and at that point I realized it could not be an airplane. I was very afraid so I ran out of my room down to another part of the building I was staying in.  I went back to the room about an hour later and of course it was gone, sun was coming up.  It was a clear day, no storms.;48.1119;-105.6293
