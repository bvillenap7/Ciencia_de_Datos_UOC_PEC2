Large boomerang object flies close to ground.;2005-08-15 22:00:00;3 minutes;Large boomerang object flies close to ground. A friend and I were sitting outside on a fort raised off the ground.  The sun had barely gone down and a storm clouds were coming from the north, you could see lightening and hear thunder in the distance. Once the boomerang object came into our view from the east, you could no longer hear the thunder though you could still see lightening.  It was traveling very very slowly.  Had a few circular lights.   Flew directly over us, very close to the ground.  Passed within a few minutes and continued on going east before we couldnt see it in the clouds.   Once it had passed you could hear the thunder once more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));48.1119;-105.6293
