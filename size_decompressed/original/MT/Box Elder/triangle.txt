It was big and moved real slow.;1993-05-18 03:00:00;1 hour;It was big and moved real slow. I was on leave from the US Army, when I was walking along the Agency Road, when I saw lights moving accross the prairie.  It was moving a NE to SW direction in front of me, I was standing facing north.  AS THE Light crossed in front of me, I noticed that it had a dull or Dark color and that it was Triangle shape.  There was no sound,but it was really big!  In fact,it really scared ((deleted)) me!!! As it got close to where I was standing, all the lights went out.The lights were originaly white,like car headlights, or more like aircraft landing lights.  I fly,so I know what they look like.;48.2829;-109.8225
