The animals were in terror.;1978-03-15 01:00:00;maybe 2 - 3 minutes;The animals were in terror. I was up late reading, had just let my dog inside, when she wanted to go out very badly. I opened the door, and she indicated that I follow her.  Once outside, I heard the horses in our pasture, and the cattle across the road just going nuts with fear, and all of the outside neighborhood dogs barking.  My dog was looking straight up, snarling, and had her fangs bared.  I looked up and saw a single green light.  I watched it for just a few seconds, then I looked down and said to my dog: I certainly hope you are seeing what I am seeing.  When I looked back up, the light was gone, the horses and dogs in the area were then quiet.  You have to understand that at that time, this was a very rural area.  The next day, I questioned a couple of neighbors, and none of them had heard anything. I was unable to determine how close this light was, there were no reference points, and there was absolutely no sound but for the animals. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
