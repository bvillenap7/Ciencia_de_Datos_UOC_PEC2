Unknown craft with white light in front and slow pulsating deep red light in rear.;2015-11-18 00:00:00;20-25 minutes;Unknown craft with white light in front and slow pulsating deep red light in rear I noticed a bright white light approaching from the south.  Behind the bright white light a slowly pulsating deep red light was also visible.   At first I thought it was a plane approaching but as it got closer I noticed that something wasn't right with the lights.  Unlike conventional aircraft lights, these didn't shimmer or spread out.  The lights appeared as if the light particles themselves were contained somehow.  The deep red light I have never seen on an aircraft of any type before.  Not consistent in any way to a anti collision light.   As it approached Lolo, it slowly started to move east across the valley then headed back north right above the mountain on the east side of Lolo.  When it turned east then north neither of lights faded out as you would expect when a plane banks towards or away from you It didn't make a sound, dead silent.   As it was moving north flying parallel to the mountain on the east side, it went straight in front of several bright stars that were rising.  As it flew in front of these stars, the stars were still visible in between the white and red lights were you would expect some type of structure to block them out.   The stars and the sky itself seemed to waiver, exactly the way one would assume some type of cloaking device would work.  It proceeded slowly north over Missoula, then West and out of site.   I watched for awhile to see if it came back towards the airport but didn't.   Have no idea what it was but certainly was not a conventional aircraft of any sort.;46.7554;-114.1109
