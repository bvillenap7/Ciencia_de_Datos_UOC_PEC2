Large craft spotted in Northwest Montana;2002-08-20 23:10:00;45 minutes;Large craft spotted in Northwest Montana Very large craft spotted near the top of a mountain right above the tree tops. Roughly two miles away from us one large blue and red light on top with a horizontal row of about 50 lights along the center and two smaller lights on the bottom. Very bright light emitted from object. The light on top was turning on and off regularly about the size of a quarter cresent shaped red within blue making a circle. Row of lights randomly turning on and off considerably smaller than the top light these lights had a sparkler effect when they lit up. There was a storm further south and sheet lightning to the west. Object was observed for 45 min when the storm broke the object was gone. I have never seen anything like this before thought the mountain was on fire at first glance. A close estimate would put the object at a half mile in diameter.;48.0768;-115.8582
