Mothership with escort;1990-08-15 22:00:00;intermittent;Mothership with escort The people on the northern cheyenne reservation for years have been seeing these flying objects for years. Here's my description I seen a totally green object 500 feet or so above the treeline. I was on the highway, it was coming right at me. As it came closer I noticed another light (soft yellow light) going from one side all the way around the front to the other side, repeatedly. As it came closer I noticed this light was all together seperate from the green one. As it approached the hi-way a bus in front of me hit its passenger lights to let kids off the bus. When it did that, the smaller light went under the green light and lit up, also the green light lit up. I realized then there were two craft, the yellow one was the size of a large truck and the green one was as big as a football field. Unknown if any of the kids seen it?
