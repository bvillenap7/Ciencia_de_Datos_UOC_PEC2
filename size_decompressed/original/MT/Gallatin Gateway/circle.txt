Orbs buzzing, flash around over mountains;2016-12-11 06:15:00;2 minutes;Orbs buzzing,  flash  around over mountains Just above the mountain range SSW of Gallatin Gateway, I noticed what appeared to be a spherical light moving from peak to peak very quickly in a very irregular flight pattern very resemblant to that of a housefly's.  Object began to change colors and seemed to have 2 smaller versions of itself splitting off from and readjoining with the main one.  This was done in seemingly random pattern.  The 2 smaller ones began blinking at irregular, non repetitive intervals.  The 3 of them seemed to fly away from me until they were almost inperceivable, then in a fraction of the time, reappearing close as before again, but in different position equal to about 5 moons diameters away.  Then, one time it didn't reappear.;45.339;-111.2485
