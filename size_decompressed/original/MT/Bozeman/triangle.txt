Triangular object moving SSE, observed a week prior at same hour.;2012-03-27 22:51:00;APX 10 minutes;Triangular object moving SSE, observed a week prior at same hour. At around 10: 51 PM, I stepped out side for a smoke and I notices three red lights in the sky that would occasionally flash white.  The lights were in a triangular form moving SSE either over Huffine Lane or in the fiends behind.  It appeared to drift in the sky and never made a sound.  Complete silence.  This is not a plane either because I could see the landing lights of a plane that was approaching form the south to Gallitan Airfield.  The plane appeared to be above the object due to the eachs relative position to the other.  I observed the same object exactly a week (to the minute) before (03/20/2012) moving along roughly the same path.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Triangle shape UfO red lights over Bozeman MT Hyalite Mountains;2014-05-14 00:00:00;15 minutes;Triangle shape UfO red lights over Bozeman MT Hyalite Mountains I observed a triangle shape UFO 5/14/14 from my porch at approx 12:18 am.  In Bozeman, MT.  It appeared from Hyalite Mountains.  The triangle was blinking red lights strobe style, one after the other in order. ..triangular lights.  The UFO was traveling east towards MSU campus then it disappeared behind treeline.  I followed down the road on foot to see it further.   Suddenly, the UFO was gone!  Not even 2 min after that i see a tiny yellow object shooting across the skyline going west.  I stayed outdoors to observe further.   About 10 min later @ approx 12:30 am, the same triangle object (red lights blinking) was traveling in the opposite direction it was before not East, but West same direction as the yellow object went.  It seemed as though this time however the yellow object was leading the red triangle UFO because the UFO followed the triangular object West.  When i observed yellow object both times  The yellow object (circular, star shape) seemed to travel very fa! st. ..it went east the first time (same as UFO) it went west second time (as it seemed to lead UFO.  (I don't know how to explain this except I think the yellow object must have somehow went eastward (very fast) again because the second time I saw it was when the UFO re-appeared it seemed to lead the UFO westward (Or maybe a different yellow object seemed to lead the triangle O Westward!!!) (For Bozeman residents towards four corners).  Anyway it was another encounter. . same location different date, year & time much different shaped UFO craft, however.   Please Bozeman residents report your witnessing to this!  Also, a jet streak showed up in the sky right afterwards.  Thanks!;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Orange and red blinking triangle over a state park where I was taking photographs.  ((NUFORC Note:  Astronomer report.  PD));2015-01-21 23:35:00;3 minutes;Orange and red blinking triangle over a state park, where I was taking photographs. Went up to Hyalite Reservoir at night to take some Astrophotography.  I was taking photos when I saw it show up on my screen after I took the photo.  The photo is a long exposure, you can see it streak across the Sky but that's it.   The object slowly flew over the reservoir and toward the mountains where it disappeared over the ridge.  It had 3 orange/red lights that formed a pointed triangle, with all 3 emitting a slow blinking red light too.   My locations was out in the middle of deep mountains of a state park and I've never once seen a plane fly near it.
