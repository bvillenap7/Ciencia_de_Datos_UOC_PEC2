Reddish formation of dots in Y shape;2012-06-02 22:50:00;5 minutes;Reddish formation of dots in &quotY&quot shape At around quarter to 11 at night my friend called me and said he saw strange lights on the west end of town. I live on the east end of town and there are many trees on my street so I couldn’t see anything but I am a block away from Pete’s Hill, a popular jogging trail with a full view of the city.  I went up on Pete’s Hill and saw the lights my friend was talking about. He was on the far west end of town but from the description he gave it didn’t take me long to see what he was talking about.  There were four lights that were a reddish color and seemed to flicker a bit. They were in the shape of a “Y” or as my friend said, a triangle with another dot in the bottom center.  There seemed to be a fifth light (but very faint) slightly underneath the right side top of the ‘Y’.  I watched for a couple of minutes and they slowly seemed to float away from each other. It was slow enough that it wasn’t very noticeable but I could tell that after a couple of minutes they were in slightly different positions from each other. They eventually got fainter until I could not see them anymore.  I tried to look up what they could be online but couldn’t find anything. My friend who saw them showed me this site today that listed a similar occurrence on the same day, so I thought I should post my experience. It is nice to know we weren’t alone in seeing this.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Four orange lights brighter than stars moving erratically and forming a Y;2012-06-02 23:17:00;10 minutes;Four orange lights brighter than stars moving erratically and forming a Y I checked the clock as I walked out for my nightly walk with our dog on 6/2/12, it read 11:16 pm. Nothing seemed amiss as I walked to the park, watching the sky as I normally do.  Being an avid sky watcher I keep track of space weather catching meteor showers and aurora often at 46 deg. N (As I type now the aurora are flickering outside with a hazy white glow.)   The moon was out almost full and there was partial cloud cover to the south.  I noticed several planes and satellites seeing the tell tale signs, flashings lights and steady paths.   To the south I saw an orange ball of light, it was bright and larger then the stars.  I waited for it to come in thinking it could be a planes spotlight coming directly at me.  Then two other orange lights started moving up from below horizon line and climbed up towards the first light.   While this was happening a fourth orange light appeared near the first.   They  started to  move erratically around  the first but not very fast and silently, until they reached formation.  The formation was a large sideways Y, there was a dot on each point and at the center where the lines meet.   They then began to glow very brightly, and I took off running home.  I got my girlfriend and we ran up to the deck and both watched as the lights moved about in front of passing clouds.   I struggled to get my camera out, by the time I did two had vanished.  Now only the first and fourth remained.   I zoomed in and narrated as the first one stayed lit and the fourth faded in and out a few times but stayed in the same spot. I turned off the camera to save memory but did manage to get two of the four lights on video.   After this the original disappeared, and I thought are we the only ones that saw this, then did they or it see us. In what to me seemed like a response to my thought, the lights on the neighbors porch started to strobe individually for about 10 to 15 seconds. These two lights are on the same circuit and are both controlled by one light switch, so this was very strange.  I then ! felt it best to go inside and lock up for the night.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Line of approximately 2 dozen blinking red lights, moving W to E over Gallatin Valley, Montana.;2017-12-09 20:00:00;3 minutes;Line of approximately 2 dozen blinking red lights, moving W to E over Gallatin Valley, Montana. We (my roommate and I) were ice fishing on Hyalite Reservoir on the evening of Saturday, December 9, 2017, at approximately 20:00 hrs.  The sky was very clear with no moon to light the sky and little light pollution otherwise.  The stargazing at Hyalite is very good. Looking to the north we spotted a line of red lights moving west to east.  The lights were flashing approximately once a second, in no particular order and held a very steady, evenly spaced formation.   They eventually vanished behind clouds, so we assumed they were flying at an altitude of at least a several thousand feet above the ground.  It took a few minutes for the objects to move across the sky and appeared to be moving like distant planes, but the lights did not match any sort of aircraft we had seen in the sky before, and the steadiness of the line-formation was unique.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
