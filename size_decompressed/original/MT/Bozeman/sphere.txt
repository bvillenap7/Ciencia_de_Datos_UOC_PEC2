2nd incident since July 16th, slow streaking object on the 25th, erratic movement on the 16th.;2010-07-25 22:30:00;5 seconds?;2nd incident since July 16th, slow streaking object on the 25th, erratic movement on the 16th. Drving from Bozeman to Belgrade.  I saw something streak north in the sky I thought I was seeing a shooting star (I have only seen about 4-5 in my lifetime), but then it went behind clouds, and I could see it partially obscured by the clouds, and continue in a straight, maybe barely arcing path. There was no accompanying roar as if it was a plane or jet, and it was not as fast as a shooting star, but faster than any plane I have seen.  My roommate was in the car (passenger seat), but he did not see anything, and I kept asking him if he saw it, and he said no.  It was only one object I saw. I grew up around the space center in Clear Lake, Texas, and have seen shuttle launches in Florida when I was a kid, and my best description is if a shooting star had a bit of a trail that disappeared as soon as it was made.  It was traveling South to North, and was too bright and constant to be a star, along with being too big.  It flew just behind some clouds, continued on and then disappeared. I do not know what to make of this, but this is not the first time I have seen something weird in the sky here in Montana.  I Arrived in Bozeman December 23rd, 2009, and last Friday (July 16th) I saw a very strange object in the sky that I mistook for a star, until it moved, leading me to believe it was a plane, but then it moved in very tight curves and zig-zagged.  After about 1 minute it disappeared, but then I could only see it with peripheral vision, and could not observe it if I looked directly at it.  My roommate was outside with me as well, and witnessed and confirmed the object, it's movement, and then it only being observable with peripheral vision. After tonight's incident, I checked online for other stuff like that, and came across your website.  I do not like UFO phenomenon, and honestly I am a bit shaken by these two incidents.  I have never witnessed anything like it, with excetion to shooting stars, that DO NOT look like what I saw.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
A sphere of bright orangish light in the rural area between Bozeman and Belgrade.;2012-05-13 22:45:00;35 minutes;A sphere of bright orangish light in the rural area between Bozeman and Belgrade. Driving home on Valley Center I noticed a large bright sphere hanging high in the sky above the area between Belgrade and Bozeman.  It seemed far away but it looked fairly large so there could have been more than one craft but it was probably just one.  I don't know if this was a UFO or some sort of strange late night publicity stunt.  At first glance I thought it was moving, but upon further scrutiny I saw that it was just hanging there.  I'd love for this one to be debunked. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682

Approximately 10:35 PM, weather was  cloudy  with some sprinkles of rain. Observer was driving in westerly direction, slightly uphill on Highland Blvd near Bozeman Deaconess hospital.  The string of lights, approximately seven to eight round, orange objects in Western sky over Bozeman were moving at a steady, not overly rapid pace toward southeast.   Observer then  drove to top of hill just north of blue water tower above Highland Blvd to listen for sounds.  Objects were silent.   Not positive as to exact number of objects due to driving a car and some objects had moved into clouds.  At least two objects were ahead of  a linear formation of 4 or more objects with one larger sphere trailing more slowly.   All objects disappeared into overhead clouds and once in the clouds,  no lighted objects! were seen although the moon in high, slightly southwest location was a very diffuse white light behind clouds.  Object  speed was similar to a motorized hang glider but without sound, and moved in a steady linear fashion.   No planes were heard in the area although major airline jet was seen approaching from east to airport (approximately 10:38 pm) with obvious bright white landing lights.    Initial thought was objects appeared to be a string of outdoor orange Christmas lights.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
UFO's over Bozeman, MT?  12-31-2013.;2013-12-31 22:30:00;45 minutes;UFO's over Bozeman, MT?  12-31-2013 My housemate steps outside every night to view the night sky.  On this particular evening, he looked outside the front door and heard some neighbors talking in their driveway.   He went outside to make sure things were okay when he saw the lights just above the Bridger horizon, traveling east.  He ran inside, told me to come outside, and ran back out.   I joined him in the driveway and observed three lights traveling at the same speed, in the same direction, at the same altitude, and disappeared into the clouds.  I only saw three of the lights, he saw a total of 8.   I confirmed with a friend who is a pilot that small planes would have had flashing lights.  There was no sound, no flashing lights, just a steady orange glow moving across the sky, just above the mountain horizon.   I am wondering if they were the celebratory lanterns.  That would be the last logical explanation before considering an E.T. source.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682

Waning moon clearly visible, looking southeast, orange object appearing about 1/3rd the size of the moon about one hand-width below moon.  Did not move.   I took a picture and the moon and object clearly visible, and to the right of orange blog a dark grey round object and another bright object, which were not visible to me at the time.  Those last two objects possible camera artifacts, but the blob under the moon clearly visible and on photo (iPhone);45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Bright light sphere moving across the sky;2019-07-20 00:00:00;5 minutes;Bright light sphere moving across the sky On July 20 about approx 10:45 PM my family and I was sitting outside enjoying a bonfire. We looked up into the night sky and saw the big dipper and we noticed a bright orbital light traveling from south west.   Moving across in a east north east  direction.  It was traveling at a constant speed and seemed to waver a little bit at least it looked as if it was wavering in the sky.  it moved eastward until it was completely out of sight over the mountains.  it was higher in the night sky than an jet airplane and it was moving faster than any plane because we observed a plane going by from the south to the north end at the same time. I thought it might be the international space station but I checked the times and it was not supposed to be traveling overhead until after 1 am 5 adults and  1 child witnessed the event.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
During the evening of April 7, 2020, there was an impressive sundog appearing in the western sky.  ((Lens flares.  PD));2020-04-07 19:02:00;1 minute;During the evening of April 7, 2020, there was an impressive sundog appearing in the western sky from where I live northwest of Bozeman, Montana.  My wife and I viewed it together. There was variable cloud cover, which apparently made for good conditions for a sundog to form. I took two electronic photos with my iPhone (4G LTE, Verizon) just to casually document the sundog and did not look at my photos until the next day.  Of course, I was surprised to see a luminous blue-green object in each of the photos. The camera date/time feature on the camera recorded April 7, 7:02 p.m.  My guess is that the photos were snapped between ten and 30 seconds apart. Oddly, neither my wife nor I recall seeing the luminous object(s) with a naked eye while looking at the sundog—but the camera did!  Photo one: taken through the living room window with part of the deck table visible. I cannot tell exactly where the object is relative to the white fence.  It could be closer or a bit further way.  The  distance from the window to the fence was measured with a tape to be roughly 176 feet. The height of the fence is 5’8” top edge to bottom edge, and the top edge maintains about 5’10” above the ground. The approximate vertical displacement from the floor inside the house to the ground is about 28 inches. There is a stream about four feet wide between the lawn and the taller vegetation but is not discernable in the photos.  Photo two: taken from the deck.  A rough measurement from my approximate position on the deck to where the object appears to be in the photo is 73 feet. The deck is 15 inches above the ground. Zoom in on the photo two object: it seems to be in the process of forming or disintegrating.  It seems to have a different configuration than in photo one. Note the “aura” in photo two. If the object(s) are one and the same in both photos, then it moved about 100 feet closer to me in the 10-30 seconds between photos.  Was it aware of my wife and me?  How long was the object around? What was it doing?  Why were we unaware of it and not seeing it with a naked eye?  This was not the first time that an unidentified object has appeared with a sundog photograph from our house.  One appeared in a photo taken just after sunrise in early March 2019, with unseasonably cold, sub-zero temperatures outside.  The object appeared as a planet-like figure to the right of the sundog in the distance, much smaller than the Moon. If you are interested, I could send you a photograph of this one also.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
