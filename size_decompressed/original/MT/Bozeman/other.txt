Looking out from my second story bedroom window, which faces South, an angular (at least 5 one-dimensional sides)streaked smoothly, in a very shallow arc, across the sky in a South-East direction.  The chunk had a heat glow - bright, clear light blue at the edges deepening to a darker blue towards the body of the object and trailed a hazy, glowing, misty tail of faint blue and cream which was twice the length of the object and shaped almost like a candle flame on it's side.  The body looked metallic and somewhat crinkled or angular.  I did not percieve any portion of it as smooth.  The size was approx 1/5 to 1/7 the size of a full Moon.  It cleared the mountain range South-East of my city which is about 7 miles away from my home.  Also, the tail included what I percieved to be sparks.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682

2006 UFO Sighting in Gallatin County, Bozeman Montana. Multiple close encounters.;2006-08-29 00:30:00;See below;2006 UFO Sighting in Gallatin County, Bozeman Montana. Multiple close encounters. 2006 UFO Sighting in Gallatin County Montana Multiple unexplainable sightings through the night. August 29, 2006. Bozeman Montana. Skies, Clear, Cloudless Night. Temperature 40 degrees. I was camping, with sleeping bag only, behind a burm in a grass-less construction lot.  It was about a quarter mile square.  Mall to the south, treeline to the north, townhouses to the east and the highway to the west.  I was told later that there is a military base of some kind near this location. 12:30 AM While camping out in an empty dirt lot behind Bob Wards Sporting Goods noticed what thought was a plane or planet (too low to be a star), blue-white. It began blinking/flashing noticed several other blinking/flashing objects low in the night sky as well. There is an airport in Bozeman so figured it was a few airplanes, but kept looking anyway. This went on for some time, I'm guessing 15 minutes. 12:45 AM Suddenly one of these planes began to move through sky at will, whimsically even--gaining losing elevation, making impossibly sharp turns. The flashing became frenetic. Then other two flashing objects began moving similarly. They behaved like this for about 30 minutes. They disappeared searched sky but they were nowhere to be found  2:15 AM After an hour searching sky my heart slowed down and I decided to turn over go to sleep. 3 meteors streaked from sky (west to east) to the ground behind some new townhouses, one-at-a-time in short intervals. Okay, I said to myself, I'm awake again. I kept watching the townhouses. In a few minutes I noticed movement around the townhouses and 20 feet above townhouses, two unrecognizable shapes (because they were dark against a night blue sky) moving silently in a circular fashion. Gradually they began to emit light began to see them clearly. My neck hair was standing on end. 2:25 AM They were two, sometimes three playfully eminating, green, misty, dancing globes above aforementioned townhouses almost cracked a smile watched dancing lights until they stopped, just before sunrise. *That was it for that night.***  I camped here for the next couple days. I saw the dancing lights above the town houses every night. Then on the last night I was to camp here, I was watching the dancing lights and suddenly a room in townhouse was brightly illuminated for a fraction a second, as if someone had a flash light (stark, cold blue-white light), then another, in sequence--as if someone was going room-to-room. But quicker than a human could run to each room. I wondered if there was anyone living there and hoped they were alright. There were cars parked out front, but no sign of human activity. I wondered if this was some kind of signal. I was afraid. 3:00 AM It took me a while to calm down but, I turned over, my back to the townhouses and tried to sleep. I looked out toward the treeline. Trees relax me. That's when a red light amidst the trees turned on at ground level. I figured it was the brake lights of a car. The light slowly and silently rose 15 feet into the air paused and began moving toward the highway, dispelling that thought. Okay, it's a helicopter far away, it's just further away than I think it is I told myself. I kept listening for rotor wash. I heard none and under close observation I could tell it was in the stand of trees and I knew there couldn't be a helipad behind a landscaping company. By this red light reached the edge of the stand of trees. I was on my feet, putting my shoes on, I was really scared and wasn't sticking around for this, but I couldn't take my eyes off of it. 3:10 AM It hovered there momentarily. Then a white light seemed to turn on, but I realized that this object had simply begun to rotate. It kept rotating slowly and began a slow pass of the field along the highway edge. I knew it was a triangle now because I could see it's bottom now. It had 3 lights, 2 white-ish and one red. Before I could collect my things it was directly over my head not more than 20 feet in the air. I could see it's shape clearly now only because it blacked out the stars as it went. It was a triangle with rounded corners. About 20 feet on a side. It did not stop as I recall. Slowly spinning and swinging it's course around me, as if to say hello then off in the direction of the town houses. As it passed I noticed a low-rumbling sound, like a muffled V-8 at idle. 3:12 AM That's when I ran. I ran as hard as I could with 60 pounds on my back in the opposite direction and hitch hiked out of there. If anyone has information on this or has seen anything like it PLEASE contact me ASAP! Thank you.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Red orb traveling straight up the side of the Bridger Mountains.;2012-07-04 22:30:00;15 minutes;Red orb traveling straight up the side of the Bridger Mountains Since Ive noticed the high number of red orbs during july 4th I thought Id submit a sighting I will never forget.  My coworkers and I were standing in the roof of a 3rd floor assisted living facility watching the fireworks when we got off of work. The majority of the fireworks were to the south and east. I noticed a strange red orb traveling up and over the Bridger Mountains.  I knew this wasnt a car as there are no roads that go straight up to the top.  I thought maybe a helicopter looking for fires but it didn't fly like a helicopter.   It seemed to have followed the mountains straight up and hovered within the tree line on top, as I could see the light break up when it went in the trees.  The orb went up and down 3 times.  I left before the orb went away, I didnt think much of it at the time.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Balloon-shaped, illuminated floating object in the night sky.;2013-12-31 20:00:00;~10 minutes;Balloon-shaped, illuminated floating object in the night sky I was driving to get some dinner when I saw a strange, illuminated, hot air balloon-shaped object hovering in the sky.  The distance above the ground was about as high as an airplane would go, but it remained idol as I drove right underneath it and was motionless.  My first thoughts were Hey, it's New Years Eve, maybe it's some kind of celebratory blimp or something, but as I continued staring at it while I drove, the shape wasn't like anything I've seen before.   As I just about veered off the road since I couldn't bring my eyes away from it, it began to fall north, slowly making its way across the sky and fading into an orange, star-like shape, disappearing into the atmosphere.  I'd always thought the notion of UFOs was ridiculous and imaginative hoaxes, I couldn't come up with any kind of explanation for the phenomena.  I was curious if anyone else saw this strange object that night.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Bright Lights Appearing Over Bozeman Pass, Montana.;2017-02-11 18:35:00;5-7 minutes;Bright Lights Appearing Over Bozeman Pass, Montana. Bozeman, MT - Our sighting location was near Exit 316 off I-90 at Trail Creek at about 18:35 on 2/11/2017.  We had been outside for about 10-15 minutes looking at constellations and planets in the night sky while waiting for the International Space Station (ISS) to pass overhead at the scheduled 18:47.  The sky was black and very clear.  No clouds. The stars, satellites, and planets were easily visible. Suddenly, in the northeast sky, two large, very bright, white lights just appeared above tree top level.   The light on the right was much brighter than the left.  The brighter light was brighter and larger than Venus was in the sky that night.  The lights were of the same intensity and moved in tandem, remaining the same distance from each other and at a 45 degree angle to each other at all times.  They seemed like they were connected together. The lights remained stationary as they slowly adjusted their angle until the light on the right became higher in the sky than the left light.  The lights paused a moment, then began to steadily move to the northeast until they disappeared into the night sky. There was no sound, no color to the lights, and no flashing.  They moved slower than the ISS does when it passes overhead, and they were obviously very much lower to the Earth than the ISS.  Total visibility was 5-7 minutes.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
The brightest star/planet over yellowstone that flickered on and off and went completely out then on again.;2019-07-20 23:00:00;12 seconds;The brightest star/planet over yellowstone that flickered on and off and went completely out then on again. A friend of mine and I went out to have a cigarette we sat in the yard. She sat first and before I was able to sit she said holy shit, that star just disappeared!!!  I said no way, she said look. When I turned to look it seemed to be ok and then it started to flicker like a lighter losing it's fuel and puffing out. It dimmed and lit up then dimmed and then it went POOF! GONE!  The flicker lasted about 2/3 seconds and then it went out for about 2/3 seconds and then it came back again. It dimmed and brightened a couple of more flashes and then stayed bright.  To get more eyes on it, my neighbors were out and I called them over, we looked for about 5 mins but it didn't happen again. It gave me goosebumps and I couldn't stop looking at it.  It was the brightest star in the sky over the southern sky in direction looking towards Big Sky/Yellowstone.
