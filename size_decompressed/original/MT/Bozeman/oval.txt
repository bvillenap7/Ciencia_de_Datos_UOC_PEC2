I Up ahead you could see there was going to be a turn to the right,  tail lights disapearing in the distance.  When I noticed a Bright white light.  Looked round-dome the top half was bright,  the bottom half seemed in the fog.  You could see the out line of the object, in the dark . the mountains in the distance ,  you could make out.  Thinking I was heading into a town, or another power/ type of plant.  When I looked up again, there was a small white car in front of me, and a 18 wheeler type truck in the rear.  When I noticed another light....this one red...all in the fog,this time, but you couldn't mistake the triangle shape, pointed up, ..So know there are the two lights and we are almost to the corner...There is a third light,  white and long  -10 times or bigger in size, to the other two lights....well the little car, pulls over to the side of the road,abruptly...  with there emergency flashers going...  me I look in my mirror, see where the truck is,  Try to look in the car as I drive by,  but it is too dark.

bright oval light seen.;2003-07-28 22:32:00;3-4 min.;bright oval light seen. Just after 10:30 pm looking north and east of town, my wife and I were observed an oval light moving west to east over the valley.  At first we thought it was an aircraft since it was coming from the direction of the airport.  However, with the aid of binoculars and telescope we did not see any flashing strob lights nor was there any sound like with the two planes and one jet we observed afterwards.  The object was brighter than any star or planet in the sky, flying horizontally at approximatly 30 degrees above the horizon.  The object was above the 12000 elevation of the partly cloudy sky yet was still very clear even with the light smoke from distant forest fires and the effect of light from the town. ((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station passed to the north of Bozeman at 22:28-22:34 hrs. on this date.  We suspect the sighting is of the ISS.

Flash of light stops above the Gallatin Range hovers and then disappears to the south;2008-01-03 00:00:00;1 minute;Flash of light stops above the Gallatin Range hovers and then disappears to the south I own a store and we were just closing up for the evening.  We were just waking out the back door of my store looking out at the Gallatin Mountains.  We saw what look like a flash of light moving east heading towards the Gallatins  It was about 5:30 and was getting dark but you could still see the sky which was clear.  There was no vapor trail and this was no plane.  It looked like it stopped almost right on top of one of the shorter Gallatin peaks.  It seemed like it was hovering there for about 30 seconds.  We didn't really notice any flashing lights other than the a very slight glow it was putting off.  All of a suden it took off in a southward direction from an almost standstill to the a streak of light and then was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate date of sighting.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  PD));45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
