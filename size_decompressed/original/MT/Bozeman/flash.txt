Reddish-white single flash of light.;2016-07-21 22:30:00;Seconds;Reddish-white single flash of light While sitting on my balcony, I saw a flash of light to the left of Ursa Major.  It looked like a star, white with a reddish cast to it.   I glanced at it, thinking it was a star.  It brightened – looking like a brighter star – before disappearing completely.  It stayed stationary, and did not move.   I only saw the single flash.  There were no more after that.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
I live in a dorm room at a university, and on 3/27/18 at 0100 I was about to fall asleep.  ((anonymous report));2018-03-27 01:00:00;3 seconds;Okay.  I am perfectly aware that I sound crazy.  I live in a dorm room at a university, and on 3/27/18 at 0100, I was about to fall asleep, when a very bright flash illuminated the entire room.  It took my by surprise, like someone turned the lights on for a split second.  I thought maybe it was my phone but there was nothing on the screen and it was too bright to have been that. I then closed my eyes for no more than 30 seconds, when I jolted and had that dream that I was falling.  I opened my eyes right away, feeling like no time had passed at all.  I was sure that it was all in a matter of seconds, but I looked at the time and two hours had gone by.  It was now 0309 that same night. I am sure that something weird happened, as I am the only one who saw the light and my roommate has no recollection of the light.  I am a very avid dreamer, having 3-5 every night that I remember.  This did not feel like a dream, nor did I have one in the two hours that passed. If anyone has had an encounter like this, please let me know.  I have read that other people in my area have had the same encounter and I want to know if this has happened to anyone else.  I know I sound crazy.  But I am not crazy.
