Af;2000-10-09 21:00:00;continual;Looking to the direct west, not very high above the horizon, I saw what I first thought to be an airplane, with its lights flashing. After watching it for 20 - 30 minutes I realized that it was barely moving at all. It appeared to be a mixture of red, green and white lights, flashing independent of each other. With binoculars I could more easily see the separate lights flashing. I suppose it could be a planet, but its flashing colors are unlike any of the other planets and stars in the sky. If it is a planet or a star, I would appreciate receiving confirmation that it is. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report describes a celestial body.  We receive many such reports.

A point of light similar to a satellite flew at high speed and made several turns of 90  degrees or less.;2004-08-12 02:00:00;almost a minute;A point of light similar to a satellite flew at high speed and made several turns of 90  degrees or less. My boyfriend and I were outside at 2:00 AM on the 12th watching the Perseid meteor shower from a local park, so the sky was dark enough to see lots of stars. He saw the object a bit before me, and pointed it out. It looked like a dim point of light and moved like a satellite at first, so that's what we assumed it was, until it accelerated dramatically. It then took off in a different direction at the same speed. It switched direction several times, sometimes turning at angles of 90 degrees or smaller. After about a minute, we lost track of it- it seemed to just disappear. Either it turned off its light or it ascended higher than we could see.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Big light seen moving toward me from high up suddenly reverses itself as it notices that I am looking at it.;2009-07-20 04:00:00;Less than 1 minute.;Big light seen moving toward me from high up suddenly reverses itself as it notices that I am looking at it. This sighting lasted probably less than a minute.  I walked outside on my patio early that morning and looked up at the stars in the clear predawn sky.  I turned my head to the left and at that moment I noticed a bright light, maybe twice the size of Venus.  The light appeared to be moving right at me even though very high up and it seems that as it noticed that I was looking straight at it, it then began to move backwards and then to go up even higher until it finally became non-visible. So many thoughts went through my head at a rapid speed regarding what I might have thought this thing to be as I was looking at it.  I knew that it couldn’t be a satellite because it was just too bright and because of the way that it had just suddenly reversed itself and went straight up till it disappeared.  I have never seen satellites behave that way.  There were no running lights, no port or starboard lights on what I was seeing.  It was just a big ball of light.  The light also seemed to be sort of flickering at the center.  I say flicker, but I mean that it was more like if one were to take some crinkled tin foil and move it around in the hand just slightly so that it throws light reflections around. There actually was a car going by at exactly the same time that I saw this light in the sky.  I remember thinking as it happened that the lights on this car could be reflecting on something and causing this light in the sky, but quickly dismissed that idea since the car was down below me and on the street behind my apartment, which is on the second level, and the bright light I saw in the sky seemed too high up to be a reflection from anything on the ground. This sighting affected me in a very unfamiliar way.  I feel that my reaction to it was very instinctual and quick. I became very afraid as I stood there watching it move up into non-visibility.  I think the hair on my arms stood up and that it made my skin crawl.  The one thing that really got to me was that I felt this light was being stealthy and creeping in on me and when I turned my head to look at it, it just backed away, as though it knew that I was looking at it and sort of catching it in the act.  I felt like a frightened animal, or a cornered animal.  I then just gave up on watching it disappear and bolted back inside.  Upon entering I looked at the clock and it was 4 a.m.  My clock on the wall is two minutes fast, so the actual time was more like 3:58 a.m.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Bright light in sky then fades;2010-03-14 20:30:00;5 mins;Bright light in sky then fades At approximately 2030 hrs MST, I took my dog out for his evening walk.  As i walked into parking lot of my apartment building, I looked into the sky as I do every night.  I noticed a bright light in the sky moving due east.  I watched this bright light for about 5 minutes as it moved over the Bridger mountains between Bozeman and Livingston Montana.  While I was watching it, I was comparing it to a plane in the sky flying NW.  The plane was flying faster and at a higher altitude than the light.  The light was flying very slowly and did not have any of the standard marking lights that airliners have. (ie. red and blue wing lights and the blinking belly light)   After about five minutes or so it then faded out. I didn't see it for the rest of the walk.  When I came back inside I checked Nasa's site to see where the ISS was in comparison to my location.  It was between South America and Africa at the time.  I should also mention that the light was flying at a higher altit! ude than a Japanese flying lantern can get and the light was flying slower than a meteor.  I called my mother so she could witness the event but the light faded before she had a chance to go the an east facing window.  I was happy to have seen this event and hope to see another in the future.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Multiple ember colored lights north of Bozeman, MT;2011-02-27 21:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple ember colored lights north of Bozeman, MT On Feb. 27 2011, while driving, my wife and I spotted at least 10 ‘ember’ colored lights in the sky north of Bozeman, MT moving very slowly toward the east. To get a better view, we pulled over on a side street where there were less city lights.  On the same street, there was another truck pulled over to watch the lights. All of the lights were moving very slowly, but at different velocities.  After a few minutes, one by one, the lights just ‘went away’.  The eastern most lights faded first. Interestingly, the lights started fading at the same time an airplane heading over Bozeman, started to approach the airport in Belgrade.  The lights from the airplane were completely different in color and appearance than the lights floating in the sky. The following Monday, I mentioned the ‘occurrence’ to an acquaintance, and she was very surprised to hear what I had to say because her parents and grandparents told her that they had seen 40 or more lights that same night in the same location.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Bright white lite that made turns and speeds that an aircraft could not do.;2011-08-14 20:45:00;5-7 min.;Bright white lite that made turns and speeds that an aircraft could not do. We were sitting under my deck and looking south and having some cheese and crackers and a glass of wine.  My friend said look at that, and we looked up in the sky to the south, maybe a mile high, there was a light moving north.   I went and got a pair of binoculars, my hunting glasses made by Nikon, and looked at the object.  All I saw was a non-blinking, bright light moving north in the sky.  We passed the binoculars around and watched as the light made a turn to the west, about 30 degrees, it also changed speeds.   Maybe a minute or so it then turned back north and changed speeds again.   We continued to pass the binoculars around, it then slowed and turned east, about 60 degrees, and sped up and moved out of sight;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
4 lights, flying east, unusual trajectory, lasting only seconds. No sound.;2012-05-10 22:30:00;Seconds;4 lights, flying east, unusual trajectory, lasting only seconds. No sound. Time: 10:29/10:30  PM   May 10th, 2012, Tonight, just now... 4 objects flying eastward. I had just gone outside to smoke a cigarette, and was thinking about normal things as these four lights caught my eye.  They seemed to be flying in formation, eastwardly, they all had a slight 'wobble' as I would describe it.  These were not jets or meteors in my opinion as they seemed to be flying in a peculiar motion.  They were all headed in the same direction, but they were not flying with a trajectory that would be seen with airplanes, jet fighters or meteors, they all seemed to have an 'independent' control, and a kind of peculiar 'wobble' or that several of them, though in formation, headed in the same direction were moving slightly differently than the rest, they all seemed to be moving very fast, faster than jets, and the duration of this sighting would be 'seconds.'  They literally disappeared all at the same time within seconds of catching my eye, within seconds of my sighting.  Again, they had this peculiar 'independent' wobble, or as if each individual light were ab! le to move back and forth, side to side, planes can't wobble like that, at this speed they would have been ripped apart.  Meteors fly with a trajectory of motion and can't wobble back and forth like that. It is a cold 39 degrees outside here in Bozeman Montana, and I'd find it hard to believe that they were 'ball lightening.'  Strangest thing I've seen in the sky. Don't know what else to tell you, perhaps someone else has seen this for a longer period of time than I did. I can't honestly say what to make of it at all. I waited a few minutes to see if anything would re-appear, but I saw nothing.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682

They appeared to come together as one object and then break apart. They moved direction very quickly.  They seemed to disappear into thin air. We tried to look through binoculars, but the lights were so bright we couldn't make out any other detail of the objects.  At the same time, we also noticed directly above us, in a cloud, a white oval shaped, faint light moving back and forth quickly as well.

I asked my girlfriend if she saw it, she did  but said it was probably a star.  I would think that with the sun going down stars would first appear to the east when darkness sets in.   So once we got to house, I grabbed my camera and tripod and went out side and quickly snapped two pictures of the object.  To the naked eye it looked like a very large bright white light that was stationary.   Once the camera was set up, I noticed that the object was moving very slowly west and that it seemed a lot closer than a stars appear to be.  The two pictures I took were the best I could do with the equipment I have, which since we have been seeing strange things lately I have with me at all times now.   The pictures were uploaded and I looked them over and was surprised to notice that in both pictures there was the object and then there was a small blue light/object next to it. what was even more strange is that this blue light is in a different spot next to the object in both photos like it was orbiting the larger light.  The Larger object in the second photo also had what appeared to be a split between it which was strange but could be clouds shadowing it.  I am happy to have gotten this on camera, it is definitely unidentified to me.  If you have seen this before whether its normal, strange, or camera glitch please let me know.  I hope that I found something worth while.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
2 lights, passing by each other, then 1 changed direction.;2013-08-11 21:50:00;60 seconds;2 lights, passing by each other, then 1 changed direction 2 objects high in the night sky - about the same brightness and size as I've seen satellites or planes at a very high altitude.  One object was heading approximately 140-150 degrees (SE), the other at about 210-225 degrees (SW).  The 225 degree object passed behind the path of the first, seemingly within a small distance away from the first.  A short time after passing the other object, about 10 seconds or less, the 225 degree object changed direction and headed in approximately a 180-195 degree direction.  The first object continued on its trajectory and they both continued in the direction they were until I could no longer see them due to either cloud cover or their distance from me. About a minute after those 2 objects disappeared from my sight I saw a falling object at about 90 degrees from my location, likely part of the meteor shower expected tonight.  It was dim then very bright, then gone.  This object fell like a ‘falling star’, burning up on impact with the atmosphere.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682

It lasted about 2 min, slowly dimming as i drove on.  It didn't move at all.  very far away looked as though it was out of our atmosphere.

It was a clear night, and I often look at the sky, since I had several sightings in 1963 and have always hoped for another. I looked toward Bozeman (east), and I saw a single white light moving west to east, and I immediately thought that it was a satellite.  It was high and travelling fairly fast.  I kept watching it, and suddenly it made an S turn in the direction it was travelling, and then it stopped completely.  It was too high for a helicopter, and travelling too fast initially to be one.   I watched for about 10 minutes, and it didn't move.  It was cold out, and I didn't have a coat on, so I went inside to get one, and when I went back outside it was not there, or did not appear to be there. The objects we (several witnesses, several times) saw near Dillon, Montana, in 1963 were also single bright white lights, but they could make right angle turns without slowing and stopped on a dime also.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682

I was walking across the parking lot at work when I saw a very bright white light moving slowly across the sky making slight side to side movements in sort of a zig zag pattern.  As I was watching it I got the feeling that it could see me somehow and could hear my thoughts. I wanted to test this so I thought, if you can see me give me a sign.  Immediately the light blinked and started moving slower.  I then decided to test it again and asked it to give me another sign.  Right away it stopped moving completely and began rising straight up into the sky getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682

It appeared, zipped across the sky and then disappeared.  Certainly not a conventional aircraft.  I don't believe it was a comet or shooting star etc., I've seen many of those.
