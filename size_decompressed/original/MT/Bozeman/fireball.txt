Fireball in Montana.;2002-11-09 23:00:00;2 seconds;Fireball in Montana I was driving west on I-90, about one hour east of Bozeman, Montana, when I saw a bright thick white light falling straight down.  At the point that it stopped it looked as if it sparked a little more.   The next day I left my hotel in Bozeman at about 11:00 AM and there were a few military helicopters flying around the area looking for something.  I thought this strange.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Fireball of green/orange seen above SW Montana.;2006-02-11 22:00:00;15 sec;Fireball of green/orange seen above SW Montana. A fireball of orange and green was seen above Bozeman when viewed from 8 miles west of town. object appeared to be travelling in a southeast direction and downward - appeared as a bright rapidly moving fireball against a clear moonlit sky, then the fireball went dark, flames etc appeared to extinguish, and a dark object appeared to continue its descent remaining visible *below the sightline* of Bridger Mtn range in background.  No impact or explosion was seen and no sound heard.  Originally thought it might be an aircraft on fire. Incident reported to me by daughter at school in Bozeman.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682

My first reaction was that these were asteroids falling to earth because they appeared to be on fire.  They were round in shape with a faint tail.  I was terrified.

4 lights/fireballs travelling from north to east, moving slowly.  No sound.;2012-12-31 22:40:00;5 minutes;4 lights/fireballs travelling from north to east, moving slowly. No sound. 10:40/10:42 PM approximately.   Watched a red light in the sky moving from north to east in the horizon.  Looked for awhile to determine if it was a plane/firework, it moved very slowly, slowed down, gained speed, slowed down again until it disappeared.   Then, ANOTHER one appeared from approximately the same starting point as this first one, and it was the same colored red fireball like light, brighter than an airplane, but not much bigger.  A brilliant red light which glowed.  It proceeded the same way, and then a second one appeared (this would be a total of three at this point, with the first one disappeared.)   Then the second red light disappeared, and I watched the other one proceed.  It seemed to just slowly meander, slow down a bit, then pick up speed again.   And a fourth appeared just after the third disappeared, again from roughly the same place as the original one. I watched it move about and then it also disappeared. There were some clouds in the night sky, no stars were visible.   These brilliant red glowing fireballs or lights could not have been meteors, they moved way too slow, and their motion was not that of an airplane, they seemed to weave back and forth a bit, as if they could go in any direction they choosed, they were a strange red color that I would not associate with a red airplane light, and they 'appeared' and disappeared slowly.   This couldn't have been a plane going in circles, unless planes can teleport themselves these days... nor helecopters, there was no sound.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Several orange objects rise up into the night sky.;2014-06-08 21:05:00;8 minutes;Several orange objects rise up into the night sky At 9:05-9:12 pm on June 8, 2014, my wife came and got me, saying that there were either ufo’s or military action going on outside.   I went outside and saw 2 bright orange object moving away from each other.  She said she had counted 11 objects moving up into the sky from several directions.  I went and got my camera and got a couple of movies that were ok, but the auto focus kept going in and out, making it hard to discern the objects, and the lighting wasn’t that good.  The odd thing about the last object we saw was that it was coming up on the south side of the mountain range, as if it had just launched from the ground between us and the foothills of the Bridger mountains. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded in his description of the sighting event.  We suspect that his report is an accurate portrayal of what was seen.  PD));45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
