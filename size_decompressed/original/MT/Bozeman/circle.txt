Red flashing Lights following two solid white lights;2012-11-06 21:00:00;15 minutes;Spotted at least 4 red flashing lights following two solid white lights south of Bozeman. Tuesday November 6th, 2012 - 9:30pm  They were flying in formation in an eastern direction.  I saw a bunch of flying objects through some trees while driving.  When I pulled into a clearing I only spotted two Red flashing lights tailing two bright solid white lights.  They went to the eastern horizon then doubled back and went out of view in the western horizon where there was an additional red flying light that was not flying the sam formation, but similar looking to the other red lights. Looked like it could be a group of some type of planes, but I've never seen anything like that around here. No sounds were heard.

Red sphere that made obvious speed and altitude gains as well as direction changes.;2012-11-17 00:00:00;20 seconds;Red sphere that made obvious speed and altitude gains as well as direction changes. My girlfriend and I were outside smoking when I remembered that there was a meteor shower happening. We both were looking south up at Jupiter, when my eyes focused in on a group of reddish stars, one star in particular caught my eye because it slowly started to pull away from the other (it was stationary I focused and recognized it's position) My first thought was that I found an orbiting satellite because it started out as slow as an orbiting satellite and seemed to follow a smooth almost floating path to the south west for what seemed like an inch in the sky. The object then seemed to skip almost as it gained speed and turned north gaining altitude and continuing north for about a foot in the sky. It then made a long smooth curve like maneuver towards north east and then east following the horizon and up behind cloud coverage and out. At the moment I saw what I thought was a satellite I pointed it out to my girlfriend and she confirmed that she saw it also as it began to speed up. We then both watched in amazement and it took off. We both saw a obviously red circle that seemed to be able to control speed, altitude, and direction. She mentioned that she thought it might have had a cloudy faded orb surrounding it also. The object seemed to be going faster than anything we have ever seen before while following a very strange smooth flight plan. No other lights were visible on it and the sky was brightly lit, it was almost spooky how bright the sky was. We also recognized 7 meteors that entered the atmosphere and disappeared just like they always do. We are confused and excited about what we saw and are wondering if this is normal or has anyone else experienced this.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682

Object in night sky performs incredible maneuver over Bozeman, MT.;2018-12-11 07:00:00;2 minutes;Object in night sky performs incredible maneuver over Bozeman, MT.  12/11/18 I sent report to your email.  I hope that works, my tablet won't copy/paste.  ((name deleted)), Bozeman, MT.  We spoke this evening. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS ORIGINAL E-MAILED REPORT)) I walked out onto our patio with my daughter and immediately noted how bright Venus was that morning.  I showed my grand daughter how, just before sunrise, she could use her hand to measure from the sun to a point in the sky and at noon that day find and see Venus at mid day.   A few minutes later I was looking directly overhead to see the big dipper when I noticed a very bright object to the north.  I thought at first it might be the ISS, but it was travelling almost directly north to south.  After maybe a minute it suddenly became very dim, but I could still see it clearly.  About this time my daughter lost interest.  Just a few seconds after the object became dim it began to accelerate faster than any satellite I have watched.  When the object was directly over head still travelling very fast it performed a perfect 450 degree turn and sped  away to the east and vanished.  When the object performed the perfect counter clockwise circle plus 90 degrees it either left a vapor trail or it was so fast that my eyes were seeing what you see when a child twirls a sparkler.  This event happened about one hour before sunrise.  I would speculate that the object was reflecting sunlight and became dim as it reduced altitude.  When helicopters patrol transmission lines and reach a point where the line makes a 90 degree turn the pilot will do a circular 450 degree pattern returning to the end point and continue down the line.  This object performed the exact maneuver at an incredible speed.  I would also note that the circular turn made by this object was absolutely symmetrical.  I have been a true UFO sceptic all my life and have never had the remotest inclination to believe in them until this event on Tuesday.
