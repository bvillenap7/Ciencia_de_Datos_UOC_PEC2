Object broke into 2 perfectly round objects, one disappeared and the other turned back into a cigar shaped object and slowly disappeared behind the mountains.  Event lasted approximately 10 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a high-altitude jet aircraft, generating a contrail behind it, and reflecting the rising sun in the east.  Just a guess.  NUFORC receives many such reports.  PD));45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Blue flashing light Bozeman!;2018-09-27 00:20:00;6+ minutes;Blue flashing light Bozeman! It was a cloudy night.  Got home just off of west Babcock in Bozeman.  My girlfriend and I got out of car and looked up. I couldn’t believe my eyes.  Maybe it was a plane the first few seconds but no.  This flashing consistent blue very bright light peering through the clouds.  A disk or cigar of such.  Something out of a scince fiction book.   Anyways, it was flashing for who knows how long but I observed it for 6 minutes before it stopped.   At one point the flashing was suspended and it turned back on constant.  And then continued to flash again for a few minutes.  At one point it appeared the light altered into a slight tint of green but I couldn’t tell really.   Anyways I contacted my best friend and brother.  They ran outside and saw it as well.  There were a total of 4 witnesses to my knowledge, but I am sure many of the Bozemanites in town witnessed it as well.   If you are reading this tonight from Bozeman, this is most likely the same sighting.;45.6700175355448;-111.127973696682
Blue flashing lights in Bozeman.  ((anonymous report));2018-10-21 00:00:00;10 minutes;Blue flashing lights in Bozeman. I am getting out of my car at midnight after attending a party in Bozeman.  I look up as I park my car in my driveway and couldn't believe my eyes.  There was a stagnant craft just above the clouds.  The craft was not visible for it was very cloudy, but it was flashing blue on and off.  The blue light was in the shape of a cigar.   I was with my girlfriend and managed to call my brother and my best friend.  They were able to step outside and view it as well.  It flashed in a cigar shape above the clouds for about 15 minutes at midnight.  I tried to film it but the footage on my potato iphone was so bad in the night that it wasn't even worth posting it.  After 15 minutes, the craft stopped flashing.  We never saw the craft and my girlfriend believed it was a drone.  It very well could of been one although if it was, it was a drone unknown to the public.  It was completely silent.  This was seen by many people in the Bozeman area. Just weeks after I started to experience very sophisticated dreams (beyond your wildest dreams I promise) of boarding these crafts, tall beings, culture, and technology.  These dreams are of mere inspiration and creativity and has helped me fortify a foundation in a book I am currently writing.  Hope this helped!  Cheers!
