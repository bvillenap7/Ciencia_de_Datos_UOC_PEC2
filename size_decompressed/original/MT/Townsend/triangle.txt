Observed three triangular luminescent objects in delta formation pass silently overhead very quickly.;1990-08-25 23:00:00;3 seconds;I observed three triangular luminescent objects in delta formation pass silently overhead very quickly. I'm a musician.  On August 25, 1990, I was playing a gig in Townsend MT outdoors behind the Mint Bar.  I know the date because I have records of all my gigs, and I played at this place only once. During a break, I stepped into a gap between the Mint and the building to the north.  I was facing north.  Within the narrow space, there was nowhere to look but up. I saw three luminescent, triangular objects in delta formation fly very quickly from east to west they spanned that stretch in less than three seconds.  I heard no immediate or delayed sound. A rough estimate of altitude is 10,000 feet above the surface. A few years later, I was playing music in Europe with a couple musicians from Montana.  One of them was living in Great Falls MT in 1990.  I talked about the experience, telling him only that I had seen three luminescent objects. He asked, In delta formation? Traveling fast?  I said yes.  He said (although we had no means to compare dates), I saw them too.  We had stopped near Eddie's Corner, and I saw them fly overhead - very fast.  Although this happened 27 years ago, I recall it vividly.  I hadn't thought of it for quite some time until recently reading Montana UFOs by Joan Bird (2013). ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and he sounded to us to be;46.3343;-111.491
