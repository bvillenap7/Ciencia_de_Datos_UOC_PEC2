BIG star like object with lights of all colors seen over Southeastern MT.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2011-12-09 20:00:00;2 hours;BIG star like object with lights of all colors seen over Southeastern Montana My husband first saw the first craft (he thinks it was about 25 miles away) in the air like a star but he noticed the colors coming from it.  We watched thru Meade binoculars with a built in digital video camera.  My brother and his girlfriend were watching too and also my three kids ages 12, 10 and 8.   My two aunts next door also saw and described the same sight.  It had flashing like colors of red, blue, green, yellow, eventually purple and aqua that seemed to come from the top of the craft.  It seemed to have a triangular look to part of it but there seemed to be more to the object that couldn't be distinguished.   The colors seemed to illuminate from the inside and seemed to have an outer layer that spun around causing the colors to seem to blink very rapid.   The object was moving so slowly that for awhile it seemed it wasn't moving.  After it slowly made its way high up into the sky we noticed an airplane approaching from the south towards the object and the pl! ane was going FAST!   The plane passed by not too far from the object and just kept flying. Awhile later we noticed four other crafts farther away but not so high.  They had the same type lights and were ascending slowly too.   We watched the first object for over two hours and after a few hours it just looked like the brightest star in the sky.  Then we saw the others and watched them for a while and then we went to bed.;45.7454;-107.6087
