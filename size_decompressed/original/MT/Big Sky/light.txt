I just finished working in Moonlight Basinski Resort cleaning a home for my business.   I was headed to the trash area finishing up my work for the day and noticed a white orb shaped object up in the sky.  It was moving in an upward motion at a high rate of speed.  I watched it for about 45 seconds before I grabbed my phone and began recording.  I recorded for about 15 seconds before the object disappeared.  On top of this there seemed to be a satellite moving in a different direction that I could not see with my eyes but my phone picked up the object on my camera.  This may have been unrelated but it should be noted since it is also included in the video.;45.286;-111.3729
