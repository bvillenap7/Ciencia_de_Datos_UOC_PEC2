Hover craft pointing green laser into the sky;2011-11-09 19:40:00;2-3 min;Hover craft pointing green laser into the sky The first thing I noticed was a green laser (like a high powered green science lab laser).  Seemingly pointing to a craft.   Grabbed the binoculars a saw a craft with red and blue lights, almost like an airplane but it wasn't moving and I couldn't hear any sounds.  Also noticed that the laser was comming from the craft extending 2-3 degrees into the sky pointing at an angle of about 300 degrees (or at about 10 o'clock)   Went to get my camera flashed a picture (which didn't turn out because the flash was on and it was dark out) when I looked back up it was gone!;45.286;-111.3729
