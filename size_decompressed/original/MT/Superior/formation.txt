Pictures of night-flying UFOs over Superior, MT;2004-05-20 03:00:00;10 minutes;Pictures of night-flying UFOs over Superior, MT I woke up and just stepped outside at 3 a.m. for some reason I don't know why and saw on a clear night two oval-shaped craft in the southwestern night sky moving west to east about 45 degrees off the horizon. I ran back inside and grabbed my digital camera (4 megapixal, 14x zoom) and began taking pictures. The first two craft had already flown past, but I have pictures of at least six others flying in an irregular formation. They mostly flew in straight lines in  somewhat of a formation across the sky, but occasionally some would hover or fly zig-zag patterns as if checking something out. Then they just all continued across the sky. They looked the same, all oval, with a central dark line through their middles, with blinking white lights inside that black line. They moved fast, slow, hovered, zig-zagged, then continued on.;47.1714;-114.8826
