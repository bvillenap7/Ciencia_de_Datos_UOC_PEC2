I noticed a bright light 45 degrees out above the horizon that got increasingly brighter.;2018-11-20 16:45:00;30 seconds;A friend and I were walking our Dogs along the Madison River, and had just finished arriving back at our vehicles.  We were still in the middle of a convo, so we got into my car to finish chatting.  After approx 5min of being in the car stationary facing west, I noticed a bright light 45 degrees out above the horizon that got increasingly brighter.  I tapped my friend's shoulder asking them what the hell they thought it was, and I said “a meteor?  A star?”   As we were watching the light there was a commercial jet tracking from south to north leaving a vapor trail behind it.  We first dismissed the light being a meteor because it was stationary at first.  We dismissed it being a star because it was still too light out for them to show along with the light started becoming brighter and it started to move tracking the jet that was above and to the right of the ufo.   The light was moving at a speed of double to triple the speed of the jet, gaining on it significantly, when all of the sudden, it instantly changed directions, shooting straight up in the sky to about 70-75 degrees over the horizon and its light went out.  In its place was a very distinguishable dark boomerang shape with two light colored round objects at the tip of its wings.  It stayed hovering for a few seconds and then completely disappeared!;45.3545;-111.687
