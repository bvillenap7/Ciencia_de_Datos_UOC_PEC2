3 chevron shaped objects flying in formation that disappeared;2003-08-09 10:45:00;3 minutes;3 chevron shaped objects flying in formation that disappeared Husband and wife observed a formation of 3 chevron shaped objects moving in conjunction with each other not something an aircraft would do, more like a helicopter, but more agile.  We were facing north skies were clear and sunny. There was no sound, no vapor trails, or visible exhaust of any kind.  Husband got a brief look through binoculars before the craft went behind a sign obstructing our view.  Though viewed only briefly through 8X binoculars the craft appeared to have light colored (perhaps silver) drop shaped wings.  Where the wings joined was a central area that was much darker than the wings with what was perhaps a cockpit in the center.  We know this sounds like a bird or a plane but the pattern of movement was far too agile for a plane and the objects appeared too large for the apparent distance to be birds.  Once they went behind the sign obstructing our view (which was very close relative to the distance of the objects) we waited for them to reappear but they didn't!  The objects were too high (our viewing angle was at least 30 degrees) to have dropped below the horizon and there were no other obstructions or clouds to block our view.  The husband is a ((deleted--businessman)) and the wife is an ((deleted--public employee with considerable responsibility).  Both are in their middle 50's.;47.0984;-104.7275
