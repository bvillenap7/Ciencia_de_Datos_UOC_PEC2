I was standing outside and looked up to see one craft slowly moving upwards,  then jutting to the side. I watched for about 3 minutes, when I noticed another object moving.  I thought it might have been a helicopter, but realized quickly that the lights would have been strobing a lot faster.  It proceded to move around at a slow speed, before jutting upwards and for about 30 seconds it was a solid white light this happens every night almost if not 1 craft, but 2 they usually do the same things;47.0984;-104.7275
