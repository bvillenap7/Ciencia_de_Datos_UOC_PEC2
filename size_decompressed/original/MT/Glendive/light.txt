He spotted a single orange light that appeared to travel from north to south then veered sharply sharply to the west.  We initially thought it was a helicopter, so I rolled my window down and turned my pickup off.  There was no discernable noise. Within minutes we saw 3 more lights.  They were also orange and appeared to be flying in a triangle type formation.  One was in the lead and 2 were following.  I started videoing them with my cellphone.  They also appeared to travel north to south before disappearing.   We observed them for approximately 5 minutes.   The final one (we saw 5 total) lasted about 30 seconds and was also orange in color.  It also travelled north to south, then veered sharply west before disappearing. My initial reaction to the first one was it was a helicopter or drone.  Then I thought maybe the lights we saw were chinese lanterns.  It should also be noted that our cellphone batteries drained approximately 20% during this encounter which lasted approximately 15 minutes total.  I am prior military and law enforcement officer and have never seen lights like these before. There is an anomaly in the video that is a white light that dances around.  That is what I assume is glare from the streetlight. ;47.0984;-104.7275
