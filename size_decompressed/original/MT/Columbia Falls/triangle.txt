While walking dogs object(s?) passed directly overhead.  Sky clear with bright stars and large broken clouds.  Five lights were seen in triangular pattern defining angle of about 75 degrees from apex.  Lights were white to bluish white and constant.  Movement was constant in speed and direction.  First impression was that of satellite movement - speed and size of lights similar to satellite observation, but in perfect V formation.  Appeared to be at or just above cloud level.  Was travelling parallel to and apparently in/above long cloud bank from NE to SW across valley.  Moved into and out of wisps of this cloud bank during observation. Traversed arc of approx. 25 degrees from my viewing position during about 5 seconds, until it was lost above clouds.  Absolutely quiet.  Unable to discern if this was one object at cloud level or a formation much at much higher altitude, but if it was at high elevation,it was very fast.  If it was lower, it was very quiet.;48.3595;-114.1884
