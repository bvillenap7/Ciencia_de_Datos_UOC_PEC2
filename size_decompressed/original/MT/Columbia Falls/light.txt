A stationary light grew in brightness and then dimmed until it was not visible in the daytime sky.;2004-04-07 14:00:00;3-4 minutes;A stationary light grew in brightness and then dimmed until it was not visible in the daytime sky. A small bright dot that was in the area of where the north star is located from Columbia Falls.  It was during the mid-day on a very clear day.  The light resembled the size of a planet although it was not inline with the path traveled by the visible planets that are out this month.  The light was stationary for several minutes and then got very bright and then slowly dimmed until it was not visible.  It never moved from the location where we first saw it.  I thought we had just witnessed a supernova.;48.3595;-114.1884
3 lights in the sky;2010-07-17 03:30:00;10 minutes;3 lights in the sky I was standing outside with my brother having a smoke and happened to look up in the sky.  It looked like it was just a satellite moving accross the sky but it lit up for maybe 10 seconds brighter than the North Star.  Then it suddenly changed direction and faded away.  Right behind it came another one that followed it, then a third came from a different direction and disapeared in the same area as the first two. I really have know clue what it was but I have noticed that the past week there has been a lot more activity in the sky at night than I have ever seen before.  I have seen shooting stars,sattellites, etc.  But this was just really weird. Just the first one made a real bright light, the others were dim but they moved very fast.  Possibly aircraft?;48.3595;-114.1884
Extremely bright light south west of Columbia Falls;2014-02-05 19:30:00;5-10 minutes;Extremely bright light south west of Columbia Falls.  Other people had to have seen it.  It looked like a very bright star, or distant white sun.  It slowly moved behind the horizon, and was pure white and flickered like a star, but was way too bright.;48.3595;-114.1884
