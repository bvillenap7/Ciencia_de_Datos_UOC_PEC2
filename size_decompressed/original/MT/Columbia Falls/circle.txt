While driving to work from the town of Columbia Falls, Montana, heading West on Montana’s Highway 40 towards the town of Whitefish, at approximately 6:05 a.m., a female driver noticed what appeared to be “the Harvest Moon” in the horizon.   Quickly, she realized there would not be a Harvest Moon in March. She came to a dip in the road leading to a bridge over the Whitefish River.  When her car rose back over the bridge, the image had disappeared.  The object was described as stationery, almost spherical in shape, deep, bright orange in color with what appeared to be woven stripes of color in the bottom left-hand side, “like a basket or ball of yarn”.  There was no sound.   “There were other people on the highway too.  They had to have seen it.”;48.3595;-114.1884
