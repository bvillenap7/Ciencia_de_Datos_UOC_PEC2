After watching it for awhile, he thought it looked like there were actually two objects dancing around each other.   He came and woke me up, and we tried looking at it with my binoculars (which are better than some telescopes).  I too thought it looked like there were two separate things.  It looked like a ball of light, about the size of a very large star, and sometimes it would separate into two balls of light.  Even through the binoculars it still only looked like balls of light with red and blue parts.   Sometimes the two things were so close together it looked like one, and sometimes they looked like they were circling around each other.  Their position in the sky did not change.  We watched it for about a half hour total, and since it wasn't doing anything different we went to bed.  We are going to see if it's there again tonight.  My husband does not know how long it was there before he saw it he had been on the computer and noticed it out the window when he got up to go to bed.
