Triangular UFO following vehicle in Eastern MT.;2020-04-03 23:19:00;5 minutes;Triangular UFO following vehicle in Eastern MT. My brother and I were driving home from a long day of work.  We live about 15 miles south of a small town down a gravel road.  The drive home was fairly normal, as were listening to music on the radio and talking.  About 10 miles into the drive my radio turned off and went to static.   I didn't think anything of it because our roads are rough. We saw a bright light in the sky and though it may have just been a bright star. We decided to stop and look at the light. I said, Wow, look at that star. Isn't it so bright? He then said, It looks like it's moving closer. We sat observed for about 10 seconds until it had gotten close enough to see the triangular, black/metallic sides of the craft. I would estimate that the craft was 1.5 miles away. The cows in the field in front of us were startled as they were mooing frantically. Once the craft had gotten close enough we decided to drive off very fast. I was driving about 60 MPH down the gravel road as the craft followed us 1 mile away to the East of us. The craft seemed to have moved along the buttes to the East only 150 feet above them and moving in a motion different than any other craft I have ever seen. When we got home, my brother ran inside and I decided to stay and observe. While I was looking across the road at a butte I could hear a low humming noise. Next, the craft hovered up from behind the butte to reveal itself. I decided to observe the craft and video it. I could see the triangular sides of the craft, and the bright lights on the side of it. The craft stayed hovering above the butte for around 20 seconds before slowly moving downward behind the butte. This isn't the first sighting in the area as we have had more experiences with many witnesses. My radio was working on my vehicle the next day.;47.5169;-104.2847
