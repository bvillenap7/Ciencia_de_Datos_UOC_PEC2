Dark saucer-shaped object flew at extremely fast speeds north-west, then veered south-west.  Very unlike a plane, it had no wings.  Felt slightly sick after sighting.  Human-like objects on board.  Seemed to be able to turn without curving. ((NUFORC Note:  It is exceedingly rare for a witness on the ground to be able to observe creatures in a fast-moving UFO.  We wonder whether this is a serious report.  PD));45.6276;-109.2544
