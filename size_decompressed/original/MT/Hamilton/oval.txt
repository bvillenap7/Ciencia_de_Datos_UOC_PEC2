Green org zoomed over Hamilton while still daylight.;2014-02-07 17:30:00;2-3 seconds;green org zoomed over Hamilton while still daylight. 2/7/14, tween 5:30 and 6 PM, Was on phone, glanced out the window, and saw a green orb above to the west, zoom further west, and disappear behind tree top. Conditions: Was still light out.  Cloud cover, with light blue sky showing through clouds in some areas.  Snow on the ground, 16 degree F temp. Orb was below clouds, moving so fast, I was only able to say Whoa! what's that? and it was gone.  The tree it disappeared behind is close enough (100ft?), and tall enough (fir), I couldn't tell if the orb continued over the mountain range, or if it came down on the mountain range.  It was about 4 inches in diameter at that distance, fluorescent, or sparkly green, with maybe a slight trail but nothing significant registered in that 2 to 3 seconds.  Think it was flying lower than the jets do, but higher than local small aircraft. Would like to know if anyone else saw this?;46.2433000000001;-114.1678
