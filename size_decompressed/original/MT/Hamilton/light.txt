Large intense white bright light in the late evening of May 29, 2012, near Hamilton, MT;2012-05-29 23:30:00;15 seconds;Large intense white bright light in the late evening of May 29, 2012, near Hamilton, MT On the night of May 29, 2012, around 11:30 PM, I witnessed a bright light in the sky near Hamilton, MT, the Bitterroot Valley.  I went outside to have a cigarette, and I looked up at the stars, turned my head down and looked up again, and an extremely white light was shining-for example, say the stars are a size of a dime, and this light was the size of a grapefruit.  It lasted only about 10-15 seconds, and then slowly diminished.  It did not move right or left or up and down after it disappeared an aura remained that was rather light bluish.   Was it an exploding star, I have no idea, other than it was remarkable-the brightness was crystal white, brightness I have never seen before.  It was round with feathered light near the outside hard to explain.  I was stunned and shocked. I checked out images of exploding stars on the web and there are a few that resemble what I saw-the bright white intense light.  I just have to report this, since I have never seen anything like this before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Lights surrounding an airplane with helicopter in pursuit.;2016-02-25 22:30:00;2 minutes;Lights surrounding an airplane with helicopter in pursuit. At about 10:30 MDT, I witnessed two solid lights flying north over the Sapphire Mountains.  What I found intriguing was that the lights were positioned in front and behind what was obviously a conventional aircraft with flashing red lights.   As they approached due east of my position I noticed the sound of a helicopter preparing to take of from a nearby airport.  The two objects and the airplane kept travelling north with the airplane closing the gap slightly to the object in front of it.  The object in the rear seemed to maintain the same distance the whole time.   As the three craft continued to a northwest position from me the helicopter took off and flew directly toward them.  At that time, my view became obscured by distance and trees.  At the time of this sighting the weather was partly cloudy and in the 40's. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Bright light moved slowly NE without a sound.;2016-04-12 21:50:00;30 seconds;Bright light moved slowly NE without a sound. Was walking my dog and looked straight up in the sky at a bright star, directly overhead, which seemed strange because there is no bright star/planet in that spot.   As I was thinking this, the light started to slowly move NE while the light slowly dimmed out without a sound.

TWO BRIGHT OBJECTS MOVE IN UNISON THEN SEPARATE AND DISAPPEAR;2017-06-04 02:50:00;45 seconds;TWO BRIGHT OBJECTS MOVE IN UNISON THEN SEPARATE AND DISAPPEAR ON 6/4/2017, AT APPROXIMATELY 0250 HOURS, I HAD PARKED TO GET OUT AND STRETCH.  I OBSERVED TWO VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE SOUTH SKY, AT APPROXIMATELY A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TO ME.  I LOOKED AT THEM AND WONDERED WHAT STARS THEY WERE.   AS I KEPT LOOKING AT THEM, I REALIZED THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING SOUTH VERY SLOWLY.  I BELIEVE THE OBJECTS WERE VERY FAR AWAY AND SEPARATE, AS THEY APPEARED AS STARS.   I NOTICED, AS THE OBJECTS CONTINUED SOUTH, THAT THEY WERE MOVING IN PERFECT UNISON.   THE OBJECTS THEN BEGAN TO SERPENTINE LEFT AN RIGHT IN UNISON AND BEGAN TO SPEED UP.  THE LIGHT THE OBJECTS WERE PUTTING OUT THEN BEGAN TO DIM.  THE OBJECTS THEN SEPARTED AND ONE WENT UPWARDS AND SOUTHEAST, AND THE OTHER UPWARDS AND SOUTHWEST.  BOTH OBJECTS THEN WERE OUT OF VIEW.;46.2433000000001;-114.1678
Observed 6 red lights spaced apart moving slowly across the valley until they each winked out.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-01 00:00:00;10 minutes;observed 6 red lights spaced apart moving slowly across the valley until they each winked out Within a few minutes after the New Year (2019) we were on our porch watching fireworks, when we spotted a strange red light moving slowly between us and the mountains, which is only a few miles away.   We ran to the other end of the porch and saw it still drifting across the field and move on down the valley.  We then moved to the back deck to see if we could see it further away, when suddenly two more objects (lights) looking exactly like the first light, came into view.  They just drifted on down the valley following the first light and then winked out.  Then three more red lights, looking like the other three, seemed to swoop into view and drifted across toward the field.  One just kept going and winked out, but the fifth one seemed to turn and get brighter and then winked out.  The last light never made it as far as the others and got dimmer and dimmer and went out.  The lights were not blinking or making any sound, so we knew they weren't airplanes or he! licopters.  They all followed the same flight path and the same altitude.  The shape of the lights was unusual.  They were slightly elongated vertically.  There seemed to be something in front of the lights, but it was not discernible.  We tried to be objective and wondered if we were seeing those flying light lanterns or some kind of new fireworks.  They were certainly strange and we had no idea what they were.   A few nights later, we were listening to Coast to Coast and heard Peter Davenport's report and one of them sounded similar to ours coming from Boise, ID. on the same night.  The report was of 6 red lights.  Our mountain range borders Idaho, and as the crow flies, we're in line from Boise.
