I first observed it directly overhead, and then faced west to watch its flight path.  It was moving in a straight line at a constant speed.  It seemed to be very high altitude and it was moving at a moderate speed.  It was a point of white light, and had it been motionless, I would have mistaken it for a star.  I observed it on one side of my house for about 30 seconds until the trees in my yard blocked my view.  I moved quickly to the back of my house, but I was unable to locate the object again.  The sky was very clear except for a few clouds here and there. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to be an excellent witness.  Satellites almost invariably do not fly to the west.  PD));48.3884;-114.0584
Saw something wierd, got it on video.;2003-07-15 05:00:00;10-20 minutes;Saw something wierd, got it on video. Hello, let me start by saying I do NOT even believe in aliens and ufo's, but I saw something really weird about 3 days ago, and then this morning at 5 am I went out to turn off our sprinkler, and I saw it again. So I woke up my husband and took out the video camera. I do not know what other explanation there could be, at 5 am, I can see no stars, the sky is getting bright, and here is this large bright light near the moon. The first time I saw it it was not near the moon, and in a totally different area of the sky. I can see it with my naked eye as I do not own a telescope, it has a yellowish color to it compared to the moon, and I got it on video for about 10 minutes. I am open to suggestion as to what it may be, and what I should do from here. I live in Hungry Horse Montana if that will help you determine the location of what I was viewing and that is at 5 am Mountain time. It was to the right of the moon about 2 inches (visually with my fingers) so whatever distance that would be maybe you know. This was on July 15th 2003. Please contact me, and give me some idea who I would need to talk to if you are not the right person. ((NUFORC Note:  Mars in conjunction with the Moon.  PD));48.3884;-114.0584
