Toy top looking saucer;2000-12-28 04:00:00;5 min;Toy top looking saucer Last night, at 4:00 am, my daughter woke me up, and after I got her back setttled in to bed, I went to the bathroom. While I was in there, I looked out the bathroom window, and saw a bright light SW of here, high in the sky. It was not a star, as it would get brighter, than lighter. I only watched it for maybe two minutes, and it Blinked out as it had never been there. There were no clouds around it.It also seemed to have a haze around it, that would come and go, depending on how bright it would get. Then tonight, I was letting my cat outside, as it is nice out tonight, at about 5:50, and there it was again!(A very bright light in the sky.) I grabbed my camera, and took a picture, and grabbed my binoculers. It looked like a sideways white neon light, with a blue spike-like thing on top. Almost like a toy top. It was positioned almost sideways. I am still shaking! I have my my parents video camera from filming Christmas stuff, and as soon as I went in the bedroom to grab it, it was gone when I came back. Other dogs in the neighborhood were barking, but my own, wasn't. It may have moved a little from side to side, but hard to tell since my hands were not steady. When I get the film develpoed, I can send it in, as well as a hand drawn picture.;48.5574000000001;-109.6904
