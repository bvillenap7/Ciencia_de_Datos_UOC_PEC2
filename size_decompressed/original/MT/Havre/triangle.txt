The picture on the front page showed 3 bright lights in the formation of a triangle over the town. Exact number was not mentioned but there were multiple witnesses.  About five lights moved really fast. The lights would blink then disappear and blink again farther away. - 12 year old boy  Another report said a strange blue and orange light hovered above the ground north of Havre and droplets of light fell to the earth. Fighter jets from the Air Force ( probably from Malmstrom Base, Great Falls MT) apparently came to investigate.;48.5574000000001;-109.6904

I looked to the south and noticed a triangle shape that was massive in size (200 FT - wing tip to wing tip) moving North towards Canada.   The Craft had over a dozen lights on it and was completely transparent.  The stars in the background were passing through it as it streaked through the sky in one fluent, quiet motion.  The lights on the craft were visible the entire time and it seemed to be rolling.  As quickly as it came into view it was gone within 3 seconds across the entire length of the sky.;48.5574000000001;-109.6904
