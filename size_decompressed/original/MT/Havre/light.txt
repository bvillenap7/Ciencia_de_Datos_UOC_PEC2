Many lights appear at once, 4 known witnesses.;2005-09-14 20:40:00;10 minutes;Many lights appear at once, 4 known witnesses. At approximately 8:40pm on 9/14/2005 as I was leaving my friends house to give my girlfriend a ride home I noticed a high flying very bright white dot fly behind some clouds. I thought maybe it was a satellite dish.  As I was watching it I noticed that it was moving very fast, unlike a satellite or airplane, it was very bright.  After about 30 seconds of watching it I noticed that about 5 more of these started to appear all over the sky all around the same time. These bright lights were moving very fast, all over the place.  About 15 seconds after the other lights showed up an much bigger object appeared. The very large object was bright and slow.  It was not moving near as fast as the small lights, it was traveling slowly, it was dimming in and out. It would be bright and fade out, then get bright, fade out, etc.  After fading in and out for about 10 seconds it completely disappeared, that is when I ran inside to get my 2 friends because I knew this was very strange.   When we were all outside, the large pulsating light was gone but the smaller lights were still in the sky flying around.  About 2 minutes later, the large light appeared again very briefly, disappeared, and was on the other side of the sky.  Surrounding the large light were about 5 of the smaller lights, just hovering around it.  This lasted a very short amount of time and they all started to disappear one by one.  On the opposite side of the sky, the last little light we saw shot out into space at a very high speed until we couldn't see it anymore.  Not even a minute after the last light shot into space, 2 Air Force jets flew  by. I knew these were jets for obvious reasons (lights and sound).  The UFO's had no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea whether this is a serious report, or not.  The witness provides only an e-address.  We will request additional reports from the other witnesses.

Multiple sightings in the Havre area, 3 known witnesses;2010-03-11 19:30:00;30 minutes;Multiple sightings in the Havre area, 3 known witnesses Multiple sightings over roughly 30 minutes   At approximately 7:30pm on March 11th 2010 me and my girlfriend were walking up the stairs to my friends house and saw three very bright lights to the east. These lights were about 500 feet in the sky and only a few blocks down from where we were standing. The lights were next to each other and the one in the middle was the biggest.  About 5 seconds after I initially saw the lights two of them separated from the middle and disappeared, then the middle one dissappeared.  The lights appeared to be heading west. After telling my friend what we saw, we decided to take a drive out of town to the west to see if we could see anything. 7:48 pm- Heading west, a bit past the golf course we saw one big bright light then a smaller light separated from it. The lights were to the south. After we drove past a hill that blocked our view the light was gone. 7:53- After finding a place to pull over on the highway me, my friend, and my girlfriend all saw three bright lights in the sky about 500 feet high to the east. They showed up one by one and faded away one by one. They were only there for about 3 seconds. Two lights were somewhat next to eachother and one was off in the distance. 7:58 pm- Three bright lights show up one at a time to the east. They were visible for about 5 seconds and then faded away one by one.  After all of them had faded away they started to reappear and fade away again for around 10 to 15 seconds then disappeared for good.  After the bright lights were gone we noticed two smaller red lights flying in the same general area.  None of the lights made any sound. We have some video footage but the quality is pretty poor. You can at least tell that lights showed up and disappeared in the sky where no lights were originally atâ€¦;48.5574000000001;-109.6904
Saw Three Bright Lights;2010-05-10 22:55:00;5 minutes;Saw Three Bright Lights At around 10:55pm on May 10, 2010 my boyfriend and I were lying in bed and all of a sudden we heard this loud noise, and our whole trailor shook. Then about two or three minutes later we heard jets outside. We ran outside to see if we could see anything. We couldn't see any jets. At 11:00pm I look to my left and saw a single solid light stayed there for 2 or 3 seconds, and faded out. About ten seconds later we saw three lights, but middle light had other 3 lights surrounding it. All equally distance apart. Stayed about 5 seconds and disappeared. Then about 2 or 3 minutes later we saw one solid light around the same area as the other ones, and faded out after a few seconds. We're live on the Northside of Havre, and the lights were south east from us. I'm pretty sure the noise we heard was a sonic bomb from jets.;48.5574000000001;-109.6904
Sonic Boom followed by 3 UFOs;2010-05-10 22:55:00;5 minutes;Sonic Boom followed by 3 UFOs At approximately 10:55pm on 5/10/10 me, my girlfriend, and my dog all heard a very loud boom.  Our house completely shook.   After investigating my house for a couple of minutes we heard some jets that sounded like they were flying extremely low.   Me and my girlfriend went outside to see if we could find out what was going on.  After a couple of minutes outside, at approximately 11:00pm my girlfriend noticed a glowing light hovering in the sky.  After about 5 seconds it faded out.  About another 10 seconds later three lights appeared in the same area.  They were all staying still. They were there for no more than 5 seconds, and disappeared.  A minute or two later one single light appeared in the same area for no more than 5 seconds.  We are located on the North Side of Havre, the lights appeared South East of our location. I assume the initial loud noise was a sonic boom created by the jets.;48.5574000000001;-109.6904
