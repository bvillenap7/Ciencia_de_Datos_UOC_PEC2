I saw a small white oval-shaped aircraft to the south.  As I saw it, it passed behind a cloud, then re appeared.  It moved at a relatively slow speed and did not leave any trail behind it.  The object moved in a very unnaturally clean manner, not like any bird or man-made aircraft would.  It was moving west and did not change it's direction at all.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get any media of it.;46.4063;-105.8316
