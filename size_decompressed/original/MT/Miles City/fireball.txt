UFO/Fireball Seen in Miles City, Montana;2012-06-23 22:30:00;2 minutes +;UFO/Fireball Seen in Miles City, Montana I was outside and am a beginning astronomer.  I was looking up and saw a large fireball type object cruising across the sky from east to west.  I ran inside and called my girlfriend.   The first fireball I saw was almost over the house and she ran in and got the video camera.   Another one appeared and she started filming it.  As we were looking at that one, 2 more appeared flying side by side.  The one on the left almost hit the one on the right, crossed each other, realigned and flew over the house and disappeared.  We filmed the three of them and missed the first one.  The color of the objects was orange/red.  I converted the film to digital media and my son has added some captions and such and posted on youtube.  After finding your site, I had to report the event.
