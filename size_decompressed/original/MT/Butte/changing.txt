Color and Shape Shifting, Incredible Speed;2016-10-13 18:13:00;about 15 minutes;Color and Shape Shifting, Incredible Speed Through a high placed, 360 weather cam, we noticed something floating in the sky. It looked like it was over, or in the area of the local airport. The UFO was also flying pretty low, so it was definitely not a star or planet. It was at a distance where it was clearly visible. I am uncertain of how big it might have been, but it was probably about the width of a plane. Although the UFO was spherical, it was constantly changing shape and color. It went from a atomic rubber bouncing ball shape, to a planet with a ring shape, to a diamond shape, etc all while emitting different colors. It floated still and without movement, then it would disappear for a couple seconds, only to reappear in a different spot close to where it was before. The UFO did this disappearing and reappearing a couple of times, staying in one spot for minutes at a time. Then the UFO dipped and zoomed vertically up to the sky at a phenomenal speed. There was only a faint light trail, nothing! significant. I thought that this might have been a drone, until I saw how fast this object flew into space.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
One large and several smaller objects that blinked red, white, green , blue and danced like snakes, all larger than other stars.;2018-04-24 21:20:00;1.5 hours;One large and several smaller objects that blinked red, white, green , blue and danced like snakes, all larger than other stars. A large bright light hovered above Timber Butte to the southwest.  It changed shape like a jellyfish to triangle with red lights around it and gyrated like a snake when looking at it through binoculars.  4 of us also saw a smaller object but larger than the stars to the left and higher that blinked red, green, blue white and also appeared like a dancing snake.   Between these were 3 smaller lights in a row that hovered, then later disappeared.  Several other lights were high in the sky with colored lights.  They were larger than the Big Dipper that we could see above us.   After an hour the large light moved to the northwest and hovered for a few minutes before disappearing.  Then 2 red blinking lights appeared in the western sky and moved slowly south one behind the other until they went behind the hill.  No planes or helicopters flying at the time.  5 witnesses total to this event. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and found her to be sincere about her sighting.  We encouraged her to observe the night sky, on the next clear night, to see whether she might see something similar to what she had seen on the first night.  PD));45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
