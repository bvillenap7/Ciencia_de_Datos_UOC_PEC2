Unusual formation of lights entrances witnesses;2004-01-09 19:48:00;7-10 minutes;Unusual formation of lights entrances witnesses At approximately 1948 on Friday, Jan. 9, 2004, my youngest son (15 years) came back into an establishment where I was visiting with my fiancée and a couple of co-workers. My son asked that I go outside to see something. On leaving the building I saw my two other sons' and my oldest son's girlfriend looking skyward. The place we were at is near the airport and I expected to see some type of aircraft or such. Instead, as I looked up at about a 45 degree angle, I saw a group of lights, reddish yellow in color, moving east to west at what appeared to be high altitude and fairly high speed. The apparent flight path was east to west (after closer thought, more southeast to northwest), with the majority of the objects moving in random directions within the flow of the group, while others followed a more orderly flight formation of two parallel lines appearing at arms length to start at about 18 inches wide and maybe an inch separation expanding to maybe 3 feet wide and two inches deep at the end of the sighting (approximately 5- 7 minutes for myself).The random flying objects demonstrated high speed arcing turns, high speed right angle turns, circles and wiggling flight. After watching for a couple minutes or so, I grabbed a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars from my vehicle and found that I could not see any detail, just star sized lights moving. Again, the objects were reddish-yellow, perhaps no brighter than other stars and visible due to their movement.  They did not display navigation lights nor leave a contrail. As such, there were no contrails visible in this area of the sky during the time these objects were visible, however, quite a distance south near the southern visible horizon aircraft navigation lights could be clearly seen.  The area of town we were in is a commercial district near the local airport and well lighted, however stars are easily visible during the night  After watching for a few more minutes I returned inside the business and asked my fiancée to step outside on the other side of the building to see if she saw the same thing. Joining her was a co-worker of mine and three other patrons, who immediately saw the same series of objects. The general consensus was’ this is weird, I wonder what they are? My interest was much higher as I am familiar with high performance military aircraft flight characteristics. These objects definitely outperformed any aircraft that I have seen or can imagine.  After spending about two minutes viewing the objects from this vantage point the group moved back indoors as the outside temperature was around 8 °F. The sky was clear with some ice crystals visible in the glare of the street lights.  I then walked back to the location where my sons were.  We continued to watch for maybe a minute at which time an aircraft departed the airport and the objects looked as though they were forming one large, tight group. We watched the plane for a few moments and noticed that the objects were no longer visible.  I do not believe that we saw reflections, birds, ice crystals, weather balloons or conventional aircraft. My family and I have viewed satellites many times and are familiar with satellite flight characteristics. The apparent coordination of the 28+ objects astounded all observers around me.  Any information related to these objects would interest me greatly. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we believed his story to be sincere.  However, despite repeated requests, we have not received any other reports from the other witnesses.  We have no way of knowing whether this is a sincere report, but we would welcome reports from any other witnesses.  PD));45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
Six points of light seen in sky over Butte, MT.;2010-10-09 01:20:00;Approximately 30 Minutes;Six points of light seen in sky over Butte, MT. At about 1:20 in the morning of October Ninth a friend and I had just gotten back from going to see the evening show of Life As We Know it.  We had just stepped out of the car, when she pointed to the sky and asked if that was the little dipper. What we saw was a slowly pulsing and blinking formation, looking a lot like a small constellation, save for the fact that it was slowly moving westwards.  (We were looking at it as it was over the East Ridge.)   It had a curved line of four spots of light on the left side, and a straight line of two spots that were parallel to the middle right points.  (They seemed to wobble slightly, but kept in that general pattern.)   We observed it for about 15 minutes, at which point it became obscured by cloud.  About five minutes later, the cloud had moved and the formation was once again visible.  Through using a brace upon the top of my friend's car, we determined that it was, indeed, the shape moving and not the clouds beneath it fooling us. We watched for another 10 or so minutes before going inside because it was cold and creepy. (Two definite falling stars were sighted in the same area, along with a blinking reddish light that was probably an airplane.);45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548

Two hovering objects with red and deep turqouise-blue light(s) blue was pulsating;2017-07-04 22:23:00;10 minutes;Two hovering objects with red and deep turqouise-blue light(s) blue was pulsating On July 4, 2017, at 22:23 p.m. (Mountain Daylight Time), in Butte Montana, to the south at over 2000 feet elevation (the mountains one mile to the east rise 2000 feet above my location and the object seemed at  least that high) I saw an unknown object, I’ll call it object #1.  It appeared as two distinct lights: pulsating blue-turquoise light on its left, and constant red light to the right. The object appeared to be hovering and not moving much.  The object was in about the same location as another type of object I saw a few minutes earlier (see my other report).  I watched #1 for a while and then I saw another object that looked exactly the same in the West  I’ll refer to it as object #2.  The #2 was about the same altitude as #1.  Then realizing it is something unusual with two of the same objects, I went inside to get my binoculars and iPad.  Both #1 and #2 were hovering and visible when I went inside. While inside, #1 disappeared.  Using binoculars, I took a closer look at #2 and could see not two lights but a string of 4 round red lights to the right and below the blue lights.  The blue lights were 3 or 4 and round as well and only the blue were pulsating.  The lights were parallel to each other (blue on top red on bottom) but they were not perpendicular to the ground.  They were higher to the right and lower to the left when viewed.  Also the blue lights were not directly above the red but offset a little to the left:  Blue Blue Blue Blue Red  Red Red Red.  The lights were very distinct or solid and not at all like aircraft lights.  I am a few miles north of the airport, but there were no airplane or helicopter sounds, and the objects I saw were relatively motionless. I proceeded to take a photo followed by a 4 minute plus video of #2 on my iPad.  The photo and video are not at all as clear as I could see with the naked eye.  However, when I zoom on the photo, I can see the 4 red lights in a row as I described.  The photo didn’t capture the blue light which must have been “off” in the pulsating cycle.  On the video, the pulsating lights seem more white than the deep turquoise blue I experienced. Many people in the area were setting off their personal Fourth of July fireworks as seen in the video.  However, #2 hovers over the spectacle below.   After four minutes or so, I quit taking video and after 10 minutes from the first sighting of #1, #2 descended slowly out of view behind some trees. Shortly before I saw #1, and immediately after # 2 disappeared, I saw 3 other objects of a different type and will report the sighting of those in a separate report. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be unusually serious-minded and sincere.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.
