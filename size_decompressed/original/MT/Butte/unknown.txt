My friends and I, were hanging out in one of the friend's yard talking and trying to find satelites and such.  I was looking up and I swore I saw (what I thought was a typically star), moving left and right just enough to notice it. It wasn't flashing like stars do, it was solid.  And as far as I knew only planets did that.  So I thought it was a planet, but something seemed to make me second guess it.  I leveled my hand with it vertically to a nearby star.  The object went in and out of view from behind my hand.  I started to ask them (my friends) if they saw it as well, and one of my friends said and I'm quoting Do you see that star?  It's F***ing moving man!. 	We continued watching it go back and forth for several minutes.  I saw a satelite and pointed it out.  It was going in the direction of the object, off at 30 degree or so.  It continued until it passed the object on the left side.  It started to go around in a large circle until it was on level with the object, and TURNED  45 degrees heading directly at it. 	We were all watching it with anticipation of what was happening and freaked out.  What happened next is what got us.  It hit on the right side and a flash or spark went shotting out the left side at about 3 times the speed.  When it hit we all said some exclamations.  Both objects were gone.  Since that day I've always believed that extraterrestials have been here for the blip of an existence we've had.  And I'm pretty sure my friends are the same way.
