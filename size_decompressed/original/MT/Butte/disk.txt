Small disk in a blizzard totally unaffected;1999-03-01 18:30:00;3 Seconds;Small disk in a blizzard totally unaffected We were driving south on the interstate in a raging blizzard in a full size 4x4 truck and at 40-50 m.p.h. we were having a very difficult time due to the wind and limited visibility.  We were north of Butte in an area called Elk Park.  We were being very quiet so my co-worker could concentrate on his driving.  While we both watched the road a metallic disc approximately 18 inches across came at us head-on at about 25 m.p.h and about fifteen feet off of the ground and smoothly passed right over us.  This object was completely unaffected by the weather.  My co-worker started shouting and asked if I saw that.  I asked him to describe what he had seen and he descibed the same thing I had saw.  He had never had any interest in this subject and I had always held an objetive curiosity on the subject and had never seen an object such as this.  A friend of my wife's had descibed a similiar object in the same area on the previous Thanksgiving Eve while on a Bus trip from Boulder to Butte.  She was the only person on the bus.  When she pointed it out the Bus driver stopped the bus and they both observed it for several minutes. I have a good understanding of science and aircraft and nothing I know of created by man could have moved the way this object did.  It was absolutely unaffected by the weather and was moving much too slow to generate any kind of lift.  I was also told by a very credible older friend that several years ago he had seen a strange object in the same area and it followed him all the way to Butte.  Since I hunt this area frequently myself I will keep a sharper lookout in this area.  I do not find it a coincidence that all three situations took place in bad winter weather, there was no traffic around, there were two witnesses each time and all took place in the same park. Sorry I don't have anything more substantial. ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has received a number of reports of UFO's witnessed during inclement weather.  Date of incident is approximate, but we have asked the witness to attempt to reconstruct the date from his logs or records.  PD));45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
