This is something we often do. Between buildings there is not much light and I was admiring Orion in the southern sky as it was extremely clear and bright. A motion caught my left eye  and I turned to the east in time to see a boomerang or triangle shaped dark object moving against the fixed stars. It was black or unlit except for reddish glowing lamps pointed in the same direction as its flight...there were three to 5 of these lamps...It was moving swiftly, at an altitude of 250-500 feet and was very large. It was totally silent. I especially listened to hear engines because I have heard others have seen these things and I suspected they might be some kind of slow moving blimp, but this was not moving slowly. In a few seconds I lost the backround stars and lost sight of it. I also lost the cat and after wandering around an hour found her cowering behind a building air conditioning unit. She is also rattled and is hiding under my desk as I write this report. I work here at the university.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
