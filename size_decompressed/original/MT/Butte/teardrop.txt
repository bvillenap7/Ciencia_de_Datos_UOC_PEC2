A big orb chases a smaller orb across the sky and disappears.;2008-03-29 20:00:00;5 min;A big orb chases a smaller orb across the sky and disappears. I was on my front porch looking at the stars because it was a very clear night. When I seen this particular bright white orb moving from west to east.  I thought it was a plane at first because of it slow speed, until I noticed it was following a smaller white orb barely visible. I ran inside to get my 8mm camcorder, and filmed it just over my house.  I am currently trying to figure out how to get it off 8mm and on too my computer so I can submit it.  Upon review of the tape, towards the end of the film the smaller craft, takes off at a right angle and disappears.  I did not see this with my bare eyes. Then something else shoots from left to right of the screen next from the bigger bright orb. I could not identify what it was.  I stopped filming when I went to move through my house to my back porch, so I turned off my camera cause I did not want to film the inside of my house.  When I got to the back porch I lost track of it (big orb). There was no point to continue filming.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
