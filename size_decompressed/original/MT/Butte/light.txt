We were traveling NB Interstate 15, aout 40 miles S. of Butte, Montana at about 22:10 April 16, 1999, We stopped to watch the Northern Light,looking to the north east for a few moments whe we obseved what we thought was a low flying aircraft (one steady red light leading & one steady white light trailing), traveling from left to right, just the ridgeline , about an estimated 3-5 miles away. My son & I were out of the vehicle, my wife inside the van. The light travelled a horizontal path for about 5 degrees, whe it instantly stopped and reversed course, wising slightly. Then it stopped and apeared to rotate clockwise as the red light seemed to merge with the white light, then quickly wink out, like swinging a flashlight beam in another direction way from your view. The now alone white light began making rapid spiral dips& dives and then darted instantly to different positions in the sky, gaining and loosing altitude. As it dropped lower, we noted multiple very faint smaller red lights drifting slowly to the ground in fan shaped trajectories below the light. We contined observing this for 10 solid minutes, then decided to continue toward Butte. We kept an eye on the light, which continue to dart around for about another 10 minuted before we lost it behind some mountains.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548

Even though Im a science nut and enjoy reading about the history of UFO's and seeing all of the photographic and video evidence to back these theories up, Ive always remained a skeptic Until now. Tonight while I was out side smoking a cigarette I noticed three bright lights slowly hovering and rotating both clockwise and counter-clockwise. The three lights also appeared to form a triangle with three distinct lights as its points with a red, almost laser-like beam, connecting the three lights together as a triangle. As the weird object grew nearer, I noticed it had dim sopts in the bright red lights that were flashing almost as if it were a triple set of eyes looking at you and blinking at you. When the object reached behind my garage it stopped and quickly turned the corner looking directly at me. It must've instantly changed color within a fraction of a second and the puipl-like circles flashed very rapidly as if they just took a millon high speed photos, and simply dissapeared. The blinding flashes of light had paralyzed my vision and for about 10 minutes after the incident I was literaly blind. I couldnt see anything at all and all I could hear in the background was my dog barking and my uncle coming outside to see what had happend. He said he saw the bright flashes and didnt know what it was so ran outside to investigate. He did not see anything upon going outside and helped me from my knees to my fett and brought me inside. He wants me to go to the hospital still, but I dont want to let people know what had happend.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548

Each time the light will shift from bright red to a dull orange fading in and out.   It also moves slowly back and forth and up and down in a small section of the sky.  Then it will slowly fade away.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
White/organge lights moving in night sky;2014-02-13 21:38:00;15 minutes;White/organge lights moving in night sky We had a full moon and the sky was cloudy with clear sky.  I was just getting ready for bed when I glanced out of my bedroom window.  My first glance was a bright white light that was a star.  Looked to to see if I could figure out constellation it was, and noticed numerous white lights moving westward.  They were higher in the night sky because below them were two airplanes.  The planes flew right underneath three of the lights but there were no indications the pilots seen the objects.  The objects that were in the plane's path moved quickly away while the others kept moving in a westward direction.  I opened my windows to see if I could hear anything after the planes went by but there was absolutely no noise. Some of the objects went from white to orange back to white lights and traveled towards the Pintlar Mountain Range. I couldn't begin to count the lights there were so many and then they would simply disappear and some would move towards other lights.  There was no formations just moving westward.  I grabbed my binoculars but they were all moving pretty fast. I attempted to keep my eyes on two of them towards the back but it was  difficult because they moved around a lot from left to right and then just disappeared.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
