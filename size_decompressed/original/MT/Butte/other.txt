The Richest Hill on Earth gets scanned;2011-07-09 22:30:00;10 min;The Richest Hill on Earth gets scanned After seeing the word scanning in a report from nearby Missoula ~3 hours later, I have to report this.  I saw a beam of light coming from nowhere hitting the ground.  The only way I can describe it is as a diffuse white beam hitting the ground near the Berkeley Pit.  Totally static without anything visible above the beam.   As a skeptical, science-minded individual, I guarantee this was not a helicopter, natural phenomenon, nor anything of this Earth.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
Slow moving pulsating orange squares with blurred top making sound;2017-07-04 22:35:00;5 minutes;Slow moving pulsating orange squares with blurred top making sound On July 4, 2017, at approximately 22:15 p.m (MDT) to the south in Butte Montana at about 3000 feet elevation I saw what I thought could be a flying object with lantern or incendiary device pulsating with orange flames.  I watched it for a while as it hovered and then it disappeared or went behind the haze or thin clouds.  My only thought was someone could start a forest fire on the East Ridge.  I went indoors and returned to the outside a few minutes later and saw a different type of object (see other report) in about the same location at a slightly lower elevation. Around 22:35 p.m. I went to the front of my house and two square dim orange irregularly pulsating objects with a jagged or blurred top edge were moving slowly towards me (west to east) at a low altitude, I estimate at 100 feet.  I had never seen or heard of anything like this before.  They moved slowly and the first one suddenly disappeared but, before it disappeared, I started to take a video using my iPad.  After a few seconds, my iPad quit working.   The second object continued slowly in a slightly northeasterly direction until it was to my north and opposite where I was standing.  It then made a slow 180 degree turn and disappeared.  I could hear a low whooshing sound from the second one.  When I tried to take a photo or video of the second object, my iPad camera didn’t function at all.   In the short less than 5 second video of the first object, it appears as a hazy orange blob. With the naked eye it appeared clear, square shaped, and even on all but the top edge.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
two extra  star-like objects in the constellation Cassiopeia, blink out over half a minute;2019-10-01 20:42:00;1 minute;two extra  star-like objects in the constellation Cassiopeia, blink out over half a minute As I climbed out of my (outside access) basement laundry room at about 8:40 pm I caught sight of the constellation Cassiopeia in the clear, dark NE sky.  I was startled at the view it looked as if there were two new stars   inside that constellation.  They were very much brighter than the other stars in Cassiopeia, bright white, and about equal brilliance and separated by no more than the space of my thumb at arms length.  They were motionless. As I watched, the easternmost one dimmed and “blinked-out” over an interval of 10 seconds. Then the other one did the same.  I went right to my computer to confirm the constellation and file this report.  Dual  Supernovae explosion in a distant galaxy? (What are the chances of that?) Or some craft “parked” in orbit going “inter-dimensional”?  I am hoping someone else caught sight of this,  and am curious where in the sky it appeared to them : it would give a clue about the objects’ altitudes.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
