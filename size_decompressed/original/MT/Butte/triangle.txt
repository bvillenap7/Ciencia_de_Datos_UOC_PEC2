I thought, what kind of a plane is that? It had one white light at each corner and one red one in the middle. It glided low in the sky, but way above the telephone lines. It went over the train trestle north to south as I went under it. I was thinking what would a small airplane be doing flying at that time and it was so dark and cloudy you couldn't even see the stars. I was so awed by what I saw, and still couldn't believe it.  I thought I would wait to see if anyone else reported anything like what I saw.  The report from Kansas City, Mo. on 5/31/04 describes it exactly. And there was no sound.

Red lights in triangular formation zip accross Butte sky in 2-3 seconds.;2012-11-15 02:30:00;2-3 seconds;Red lights in triangular formation zip across Butte sky in 2-3 seconds. I was walking with a friend at about 2:30 A.M., when I saw three red lights in a triangular formation quickly pass across the Butte sky from north to south in about 2-3 seconds.  My friend quickly turned to me and asked,Did you see that?!.   The lights where bright red, almost as if you where looking at a set of red stars.  The distance between them did not seem to change so I assume they where part of the same object.  They appeared to be equal distance from one another, an equilateral triangle.  We visited a friend of ours the next day and one of the first things he said when we walked into his house was, I was standing on my porch at about 3 am, and I saw these three red lights go across the sky.

3 white lights in a triangle formation.;2013-05-25 22:30:00;10 minutes;3 white lights in a triangle formation. A couple of friends and I were driving north to uptown when I noticed 3 white dots in the skyin front of a mountain.it was a completely clear night with no stars out yet.  I didnt tell anyone what I saw until I got higher up to where I could see farther out.  Once I approached a spot where I could clearly see the triangle, it had already moved a huge distance in about 5 minutesand was notre behind the mountain.  I pointed out what I had seen and they all saw it but were not convinced it was a ufo.  I sat there and tried to explain that triangles dont just float in the sky.  No matter what evidence I showed them no body would believe me!  After watching it for 15 minutes, I said I would drive down and come up again soon and I guarantee it will be gone.  No more than 10 minutes, I drove back up to the same spot, still no stars but something was missing.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
