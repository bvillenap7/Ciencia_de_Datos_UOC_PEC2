A hovering object in the vicinity of The Lady of the Mountains.;1993-10-15 00:00:00;30 secs;A hovering object in the vicinity of The Lady of the Mountains. Travelling North on interstate 15, just past Butte on a streach of road going uphill. I noticed a sphere hovering very near a statue referred to as the Lady of the Mountains. It was, what is commonly reguarded as, disk shaped with rounded dome and also rounded in a congruant fashion on the underside. Driving up the mountain I noticed that the craft was yellowish in color, gently changing it's hue to an orange and then back again. It remained stationary till I drove under and it disappeared due to my forward progress. Thinking it was one of those safety devices used to warn low fling aircraft of hi-tension wire in the area, I was not overly suspicious. As I was coming back using the same route on my return trip a few days later I would check it out as to placement of the devices. To my surprise on that return, day-trip this time, I encountered several grey vans with strange looking antennaes emmanating from them on the mountain overlooking Helena going south. What was even stranger were the personel. They were seemingly a bunch of goodlooking guys ages between 25 and 30 scurrying around in bluish-grey overalls. Going further south past Helena about 10 miles north of Butte, I again noticed similar vans with personel fitting the above description. Guess what? When I got to the place where I saw the object there were no high tension wires, nor were there any warning devices strung along any of the smaller cables crossing the hi-way at that point. Even stranger was the reoccurance of vans further to the south, before one reached the town of Dillon, Mont.

At about 10:20 pm I walked home to get some fireworks I have forgotten,  as I was walking down the alley to my house, I noticed I very bright red/orange sphere/ball of light almost due-south of me,  at first I thought it was some-type of flare, (the color was much like a road-flare) but after a few seconds I noticed it wasnâ€™t dropping,  I lost sight of it behind some trees and the roof-line of the houses.   At the same time as this was happening, my wife, took 2 pictures that show something strange moving across the frame.;45.9978268817204;-112.588874193548
