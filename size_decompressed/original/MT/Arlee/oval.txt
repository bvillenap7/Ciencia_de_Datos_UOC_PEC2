Was looking at Venus and noticed a bright star appear slightly above it in motion.  It just looked like a bright light moving from west to east. It was around a full moon, so we were surprised when all of a sudden it got way brighter at one time.  Then, it moved pretty smoothly other than one time when it made a dip and then a jerking motion then leveled back out. we got a good look at it through the binos and it looked like a saucer shape with two lights towards the center.  It also looked like it had a huge dome top that was a very odd shape and almost came to a rounded point at the top.  My husband and I watched it go over the horizon and even had time to point it out to my daughter.  Gave me the chills when it grew brighter out of nowhere, because it got so much brighter.  Object was silent, and for as low as it was, it should have made some sort of noise but didn't.;47.1859;-114.0796
