Sphere like object pulsating red, blue and green intermittently.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness later reports object was star, Sirius.  PD));2017-11-11 00:00:00;15 minutes;Sphere like object pulsating red, blue and green intermittently. Just after midnight, on 11/12/2017, I took my dog outside.  I noticed red, blue and green pulsating lights in the South Eastern sky over Mount Livingston.  The object was stationary and did not move.   I retrieved my field glasses and viewed the sphere like object.  At one point the object seemed to have an opening in the bottom.  The intermittent light pulsated red, blue, green for the 15 minutes that I observed it.  The object seemed to have different sized craters over the whole surface with the lights pulsating from it about every second. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness later reports object was star, Sirius.
