We went to the window and sure enough there was a bright white light over the mountains in the Eastern  ((sic--western)) Sky above Red Lodge, Montana. The light went on and off and drew circles into the sky.  Later I heard an aircraft, which is unusual for our area. ((ADDENDUM)) correction to previous report: the circle was in the WESTERN sky ((END ADDENDUM));45.1991;-109.2653
