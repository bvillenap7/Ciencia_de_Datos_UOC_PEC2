Something Triangle shape with red and white lights circling the ground;2012-03-14 23:00:00;5 minutes;Something Triangle shape with red and white lights circling the ground I was outside smoking, and i looked up and what i thought was an airplane so I just turned the other way.  then i looked back at it again and it didnt look anything like an airplane  it was kinda shaped like a triangle, and had two red lights on the end of each side and like 6 white lights and some kind of haze or something like that around it.   it was getting closer to the ground as disappered behind some mountains and i guess it must have turned around because it was coming back over the mountains n closer to the ground.  it went behind some trees but u could till that it was circling around, and it went back into the sky really fast  then it came back down and started circling around again.  then it just disappered into thin air.
