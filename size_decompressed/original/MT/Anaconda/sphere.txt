Two bright lights travelling fast across the sky, then disappear.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 20:50:00;2.5 min;Two bright lights travelling fast across the sky, then disappear. Two illuminated spherical objects travelled  from south to the east.  They were not flashing or pulsating in any way, just floating extremely smoothly and fast.  One sphere was traveling behind the smaller sphere, but traveling parallel to each other, approximately 1 ½ ” apart (from where we were).  The larger and brighter (orange) sphere (which is comparable to the brightness of Mars right now, and only a fraction smaller) was trailing the smaller one at the same speed and same direction.  The objects travelled from the south side of the sky to the east side of the sky within a couple of minutes, then disappeared in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.
