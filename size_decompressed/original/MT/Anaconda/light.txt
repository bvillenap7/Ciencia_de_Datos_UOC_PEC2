Around 5 minutes of being there our friend said what the hell is that. We were facing south.  We all looked up and what we saw were several lights zig and zagging toward us coming from over the mountain.  very bright lights and we knew they were not planes or helicopters. At the speed they were zig and zagging was incredible fast. The unkown lights then stopped short of us around a mile away, stayed still together then took off at a very high speed from where they came over the mountain. We were all jaw dropped and stunned.  That was my 1st experience I have 3 more.;46.1303;-112.9752
