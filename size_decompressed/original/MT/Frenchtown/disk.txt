Color and size changing object over the skies of Frenchtown, MT.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus.  PD));2009-01-30 19:00:00;20 min;Color and size changing object over the skies of Frenchtown, MT I saw it below the moon with the binoculars first and thought it was a comet, but when i got my video camera out, it had a plasma blue ora around it and seemed to be moving. So i got my tripod out and filmed it for 20 min. During that 20 min duration, it changed color from blue, to a neon green, then to a deep purple. When it became purple, the size of the object got smaller and then after some adjusting of the camera it then got big and had a shape of a ship. The ship was like a saucer but had a orangish/brown plasma below it and with my camera holding still, it moved across the screen at 70x zoom. As time went by, the object started to condense down to a smaller object and became a bright neon green again and was switching colors repeatedly. The object pulsated as it was condensing down to its smaller form as seen on my video. The object then got so small that i lost it over the mountains west of my house. I have great footage of it and no one seems to know what it is. I took it to a meteorologist and he didn't know what to make of it.;47.0484;-114.2738
