Huge white light hovering over the Crazy Mountains, MT.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2017-07-15 03:50:00;30 minutes;Huge white light hovering over the Crazy Mountains, Montana I observed three egg-shaped lights in a tight cluster, but not touching.  One of the lights turned to the east and hovered over the Crazy Mountains.   I woke my husband, and we observed the huge white light in the sky.   We went outside and it triggered our exterior motion lights.  The object receded quickly, until it looked like a small star but within less than a minute, it came forward, and again hovered over the mountains.   We observed this for 30 minutes.
