fireball/meteor;2004-12-01 23:40:00;5sec;fireball/meteor I am a long haul driver that drives through the states every week. It was a clear night in Montana on December 1,2004 at 11:40pm. As I was driving all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash. An orange,glowing circular (app. basketball size)shot out of the sky travelling extremely fast. I saw it for app. 5 sec, then it just disapered! I stopped the truck, woke my husband up and we went to look for it. We tried to look for vapors emitting from it, we couldn't hear nothing, smell nothing, we could not see anything with our flashlights. This happened between mile marker 377 and 375 on the west side of the road I figured that the object if it did hit the ground was about 100 to 300 yards from the highway.;48.5065;-111.841
