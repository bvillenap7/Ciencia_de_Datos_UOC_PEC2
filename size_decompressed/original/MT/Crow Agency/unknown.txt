9 orange-red lights over Crow Agency, MT;2012-05-28 23:11:00;30 minutes;9 orange-red lights over Crow Agency, MT Around 11:11 PM I saw four reddish, orange lights in the sky.  They sort of resembled the Big Dipper's bowl (without the handle).  They appeared to be red stars at first, but they started to move and begin to 'fade' behind the clouds.  It was as though they were working in one accord.  Another light appeared a small distance from where they were.  It became brighter as it moved upwards into the sky and faded.  This action was repeated around five times.  From what I observed, these lights were moving in a geometric pattern.  I was with some people when we saw these lights.  One person called another individual whom was across town and told them about the lights.  This individual, along with whoever was with them had the pleasure of seeing these lights also.;45.63;-107.5006
