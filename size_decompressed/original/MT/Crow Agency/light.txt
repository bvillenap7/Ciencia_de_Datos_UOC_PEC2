driving to work spotted bright light in the sky...;2011-01-12 07:35:00;one minute;driving to work spotted bright light in the sky... I was driving to work in the morning.  I was between Busby and Crow Agency, Montana.  In the sky I saw a round light.  It appeared to be moving up very fast or the clouds were moving down very fast.  I was watching it as I drove west.  Suddenly it was gone.  I did not see it shoot across the sky or anything like that.  It was just gone. This actually happened to me once this summer but it was at a closer range.  on the same road. I was so dumbfounded by this I did not know what to think. I did not tell husband about it until it happened again. It was the same shape both times, a round light in the sky...and then it just disappears.;45.63;-107.5006
