We were near the arbor at the pow wow grounds visiting when I looked up and said I know I'm not the only one who sees that  Everyone looked uup and they all said, No. We see itâ€¦ Where did that come from, it wasn't there a second ago  It was as big as a football field, gun metal black with smallred blue & white lights underneath it and it moved slowly above us about 50 feet., it made no sound at all..we weren't scared... I've woman said, Let's synchronize our watches just in case we get beamed up  We all laugh because nobody had a watch. We just joked about it and finished smoking. It was bout 30 minutes when we looked up and the tail end of that ufo barely reached the jail 200 feet away. It disappears while we are looking at it. It just vanished. Just as fast as it appeared.;48.1306;-105.1922
