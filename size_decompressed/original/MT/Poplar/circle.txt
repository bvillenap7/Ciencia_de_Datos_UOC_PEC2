Large orb in NE Montana up closeâ€¦;2015-10-08 22:19:00;2 minutes;Large Orb in NE Montana up close... Went outside to dump trash in can by the road and heard the dogs starting to bark.  I threw the trash in the can and turned to head back when I saw several dogs all looking in the same direction barking.   I looked up and grabbed my camera out of my jacket immediately to snap this photo.  I maxed out the zoom and got this just before it headed away rapidly.  I estimated the center mass at 10-15 feet in diameter.  The object was approximately 500 yards south and 500 feet off the ground.   No wind.  Very cold temps.  Moving at 5-10 mph at first then very rapidly accelerating until gone from sight.   Yellow or orange in color.  No sound from object over dogs barking.;48.1306;-105.1922
