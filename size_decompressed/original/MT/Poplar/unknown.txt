Extremely bright super fast flashing lights up in the atmosphere performing sharp degree turns.;2016-07-26 21:38:00;20 minutes;Extremely bright super fast flashing lights up in the atmosphere performing sharp degree turns. My friend and I were out fishing off the Missouri River, when we looked up we notice two extremely bright fast flashing lights like jet propulsion blasts flashing every 2 to 3 seconds.   Moving far quicker then your normal jet or airplane, at a super sonic speed chasing each other and doing 45 to 90 degree turns high up in the atmosphere, then they disappear and about 15 minutes later one flash of light reappears doing 90 degree turns and before we knew within in 10 seconds it was further up north from the when we saw the first location from where it reappeared.   We also noticed there was no sound, no jet stream trailing the fast moving objects.;48.1306;-105.1922
