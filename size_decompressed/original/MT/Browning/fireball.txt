Object caught my attention first and I pointed at it, then it then my son and daughter-in-law looked toward where I was pointing.  At this point we watched it fall from the sky like a white fire ball with a yellow/orange tail.   We watched it as it fell through a light cloud cover and it was so big we thought we'd here it hit the ground.  It may of landed somewhere in Alberta.   Just before this, there was some lightening and we were watching it light up the sky.   After that is when we saw the fire ball.;48.5544;-113.0112
