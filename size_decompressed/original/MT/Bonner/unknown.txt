Light seen moving north east over I-90 at cloud level between Bonner and Potomac.;2012-01-04 12:11:00;15 seconds;Light seen moving north east over I-90 at cloud level between Bonner and Potomac. Driving home between Patomac and Bonner I noticed a light in  the center of the sky it appeared to be at the same level of the clouds it looked like a pair of headlights and had the same affect that car headlights have in fog  when I saw it I pointed it out to my brother who saw it also for a brief moment before our vision was obscured by trees along side the road.  The lights had been headed towards us coming from the west headed north east, while we were headed south along the highway.  We watched and waited as we passed the group of trees along side the road looking for about where the lights should have been visable again but there was nothing.  I even slowed down to allow myself and my brother to see where it had gone but saw nothing.  When we first saw lights we could see they were moving but not very fast and not fast enough to have crossed the entire sky before having another chance to see it.  The light at the center was white and outwards farther f! rom the center it became more yellow and faded.  The shape was rough and not smooth.  Still not sure exactly what my brother and I saw but suspect it could have been a smaller plane with bright headlights?  I do remember having an eerie and uncomfortable feeling about being outside looking at the sky after getting home.
