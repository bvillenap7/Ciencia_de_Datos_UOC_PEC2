Tear Drop UFO Sighting on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation;2011-12-17 00:30:00;10 Minutes;Tear Drop UFO Sighting on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation I was taking out the trash and just happened to look up in the sky when I noticed a very bright and unusual light in the west end of our community.  I kept watching, looked to the north and there were the rest of the witnesses staring at the same objects that I was seeing.  The objects were tear drop shaped with a bright yellow and organe light that was almost brighter than the sun, making the shape of a cross as they made thier way east and over the community in which I live thier light got dimmer and the teardrop shape than came into place.  The objects also had a variety of blue and white lights that seemed to have had thier own sequence and were flahsing as they floated/hovered over the community.  I could hear the witnesses say they seen stuff falling down into the community but standing almost under the object was unable to see anything falling into any of my neighbors yards.  The objects proceeded to move east bound towards Broadus, MT, as they hover! ed over the moon they let out a blue pulse was almost like seeing a fire work in the sky and than continued to slowly hover east.;45.6032;-106.5654
