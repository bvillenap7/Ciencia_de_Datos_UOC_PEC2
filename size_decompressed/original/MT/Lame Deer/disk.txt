Town sees ufo.;2001-04-18 21:00:00;35 to 45 minutes;Town sees ufo. I had been in my friends house and was about to leave. My wife and children had came running into the house and said dad something is in the trees over there. My friend had a pair of strong binoculars and as I looked through them I was suddenly reminded of car lights and christmas lights strung together. I had observed the lights coming closer to us, and leaving the trees. I knew that a car could not be in the area described as it was heavily forested with trees and a car could not maneuver in this enclosed space. we watched as it flashed red blue then yellow. We all became excited and my children said dad let's go We have numerous sightings in this isolated part of montana. Some nights we see so many that the whole town just says oh yeah  I see them,  Now what lol. One of the times we had seen a ufo I also got to see a AWAC (along with four jets). It also had sucked energy from a power plant about 20 miles from our town. (My brother_in _law(who worked at the coal-powered plant) had said they had to keep readjusting the power to keep up with the ebb and flow of the demand. We had all seen the craft and wondered why the jets could not see where it ended up. ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome other reports from witnesses, who may have observed this alleged event.
