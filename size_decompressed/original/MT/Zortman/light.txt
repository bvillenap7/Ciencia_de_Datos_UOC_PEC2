Then there was a loud engine like roart and it did a sorf of fire up thing and took off and appeared in another spot but it separated then into three.  it looked as if these lights were missles about to bomb us! but they just flew around and sometimes got pretty loud and sounded like a crashing plane. at one point it did appear to shoot something smaller and of a lighter color.. but not positive.
