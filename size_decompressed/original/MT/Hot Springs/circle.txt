Went outside to look at stars since it was a clear night.  I noticed a orange red light that seem to be rising in the southwest sky.  It appeared to be rising up from the direction of town.  I live in a little town population 500.   These was airplane lights heading east to west that seemed to pass over this light.  It rose up then headed north for a few seconds then it to turned and start heading east.  It would stop for a few seconds then start to move again, actually headed right in my direction.   It was reddish orange with lights that seemed to be rotating.   I watched it for a few minutes then came inside to get a pair of binoculars, and when I went back outside, it was gone.;47.5914;-114.6597
