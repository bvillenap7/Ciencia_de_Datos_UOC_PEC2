I could easily tell that one of the shapes was moving and was indeed a plane producing contrails.  The other object, however, was not moving.  It was at a standstill in the sky.  It was a diamond shaped object.  We sat at the light for about 4 minutes and the whole time the second object didn't move.  With each passing minute, the plane got farther away and I could tell it was by the contrails coming out of the plane.  The object didn't move at all, in the few minutes my mom and I sat at the light.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
