First it was vertical and spinning, then horizontal and moving in a slow circle in the same spot in the sky.  Dark gray, wide and short, at one point looked like a circle. Was weaving around for about 3 minutes and was as big as a water tower that was near it. the background was overcast light gray.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Huge object moving very fast, back and fourth and up and down.;2014-10-04 13:00:00;30 seconds;huge object moving very fast, back and fourth and up and down. there was a cylinder shaped craft hovering behind clouds, moving back and fourth up and down. you could see it change to a sphere into a cylinder.   then went behind the clouds and that was the last I saw.  this thing was huge so it must have been up close. I have always been skeptical of ufo's until the sighing in 2012.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
