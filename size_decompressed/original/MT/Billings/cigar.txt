Cigar-shaped object flies from horizon to horizon over Billings, Montana.;1997-08-23 20:00:00;8 seconds;Cigar-shaped object flies from horizon to horizon over Billings, Montana. In the late summer of 1997, my family and I were sitting out on our deck talking, as we've done for years.  I had been watching the Southern horizon because there were some interresting cloud formations starting.  As a watched, a bright object came up from behind the mountains south of Billings.  It continued in a straight line headed due North.  We thought it was a comet as first, but there was no tail.  As it flew overhead, we could all distinctly see a cigar-shaped object which reflected the light of the sun, which had gone below the horizon (not precisely sure what time this was, but the sun had been below the Western horizon for about 30 minutes).  The object continued in a perfectly straight line directly over our heads.  We lost sight of it as it passed behind the roof of our house, and we didn't have time to reposition ourselves to continue to view the object.  There was no sound from the object, no trail of debris or anything, just a shiny, cylindrical object flying as a substantial speed from horizon to horizon.
