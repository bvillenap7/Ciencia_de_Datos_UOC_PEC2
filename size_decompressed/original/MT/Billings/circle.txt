Circular shape object moving slowly.;2015-06-13 14:00:00;30 minutes;Circular shape object moving slowly . My Mom, sister and myself were in my Mom's yard, watching a storm roll in, and I spotted a circular ufo above my Mom's home.  I pointed it out to them.   I watched it for a few minutes then went into my house next door to get a telescope.  (I now wish I would have grabbed my camera) my wife and niece came out to see what I was going to look at.  It was moving very slowly to the northeast.  It was above the clouds and the sun was shining on it making it and airplanes shine very brightly.  There were no lights visible coming from the ufo.   When I returned with my scope my Mom said another craft flew by the first at a high rate of speed.  Same size and shape. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569

Bright silver/white object above 10,000 feet Hovering for 1 hour, then vanishes.;2015-09-02 17:00:00;1 hour;Bright silver/white object above 10,000 feet Hovering for 1 hour, then vanishes. As I went outside to move the sprinkler in our yard I looked up and saw a Bright silver/white light  straight above me.  This happened three hours before sunset.  There was no change of color.  About an hour later I went to see if it was still there, and it was, the color was the same, however I did notice the object moved a few degrees to the east.   The opposite direction in which the celestial bodies move.  I recorded the object on my 2002 digital tape camera.  The closeup of the object only shown a bright white circle, like a star.  My wife attempted to record it with her tablet but it disappeared.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Craft with lights over Billings.;2015-09-02 20:00:00;30 minutes;Craft with lights over Billings Round silvery/white, very bright and had lights around the edges and lights making a swirling ying yang type pattern across disk.  The sky was clear, an hour before sundown.   The object was moving slowly from west to east.  At first sighting I thought it was a planet, reflecting the sitting sun.  I used an ipad planetarium app to verify, but no planet or star was in this location.   Using binoculars, I could see the details of the lights.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Three bright orange circles, moving in the same direction with zero sound, flickering and disappearing.;2017-02-17 23:20:00;5 minutes;Three bright orange circles, moving in the same direction with zero sound, flickering and disappearing. Two circles almost looked like orange balls of fire moving west in unison, at the same slow speed, maybe anywhere from 8-10,000 ft.  No sound whatsoever.  When they both reached the same point they began to flicker, before just disappearing completely.  The last one trailed farther behind, maintaining the same course as the others, this one went directly over my car. I've never seen anything like it before, it literally looked like a bright ball of fire in the sky.  Again there was absolutely zero sound, and this one was considerably lower than thew other two.  But once it hit the exact same point as the others, it began to flicker, and eventually disappeared.  I've seen comets, and meteor showers.  This was absolutely nothing of the sort.  Truly an amazing thing to witness.  Thanks to youtube, I now know I'm not the only person who's witnessed these bright orange lights in the sky.

Flashing lights. no noise.;2017-12-09 18:30:00;2 minutes;Flashing lights. no noise. I have been seeing lights for weeks above Billings.  Finally got my neighbor to come.out and see.  So she calls me tonight and says get out here.  This time was insane. 16 red flashing lights in the sky in a zig zag pattern, headed north to south.  Quickly and silently.   What I have seen before is stationary lights that drift out and come back.  Phone camera picked up only a few of the lights.   This was insane and I am hearing nothing about it.  Apparently, nobody looks up anymore because Billings has been crazy active with unexplained lights in the sky.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
