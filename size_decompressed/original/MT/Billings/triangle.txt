3 Big Red Lights in Triangle Formation-Silent.;2014-06-16 22:46:00;2 minutes;3 Big Red Lights in Triangle Formation - Silent. While walking to car, 3 huge red lights appeared in the sky traveling SE to NW.  There were 3 huge lights in a perfect equiangular formation that pulsated On and Off every 5 seconds. The back 2 red lights had a row of 4 smaller red lights spaced equally between them.  These lights did not blink but remained lit. It was too dark to see the body besides what blocked out stars. Its size would be estimated to a large commercial plane, which typically approach from the East.  It was approaching the airport at the angle helicopters and prop planes approach. Its speed was very slow, only a bit faster than a helicopter.  There was no wind to cause a commercial plane to perform a crosswind landing (nor have ever seen a commercial plane with that many red lights and no green or white). It was flying very low.  Low enough that it looked like it was maybe 30 feet above The Rims. It made NO sound whatsoever.  Absolutely silent.

V shaped/triangular low flying object with faint orange circular light patterns composing the V.;2015-09-19 23:10:00;30 seconds;V shaped/triangular low flying object with faint orange circular light patterns composing the V. Ok: so I was outside looking at the giant amazing sky, when this… I don't even know how to explain it but… V shaped thing came into my view.  It could not have been more than 500 feet up off the ground, was very faint,  I did not discern a tail, and the sides of the V which is basically two thirds of this triangle were emanating this strange glow that kind of reminded me of embers in a fire burning low.  The part of the V that I was able to see was flying low, and was comprised of circular rotations that made up the V…  If that makes sense?  The object came into my site went over my head and literally into the darkness and it was silent, but it felt like something…  Some mass… Had passed really close to me.  The faint orange lights in the circles were turning, themselves in an erratic fashion but it kept in a straight V until I looked for it to hit the horizon and then it was a straight shine of light, and then gone.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Triangular flying object with very dim lights seen flying northeast across the sky of west side of Billings, MT.;2016-11-18 19:25:00;5 seconds;Triangular flying object with very dim lights seen flying northeast across the sky of west side of Billings, MT. I went outside for a cigarette around 7:25pm.  I was gazing up, scanning the western sky when my eyes caught strange movement.  It looked like a dark form that seemed to materialized nearly directly west of me, but I'll admit that it may have just seemed that it materialized when my eyes caught the movement.  My eyes adjusted a bit and saw that the form was triangular, grey/almost translucent (hardly darker than the night sky behind it) and had three very dim lights with an almost pale greenish glow at the points of each of its triangular ends.  It then flew (or continued to fly) northeast across the western sky out of view.  It was flying at a lower altitude than an airplane, and I could not hear any sound although there was a bit of noise pollution from a nearby street.  I don't know if I could accurately gage its size, but I'd said it was not a large craft.  A single point of the triangle seemed to be the nose of the craft, as that lead the direction it was flying.  The lights/craft did not rotate, cease or hover once my eyes focused on it.  I tracked it across the sky until I could no longer see it, it was moving quite fast, I'd say I watched it cross the western sky in about 5 seconds.  I am a very practical person, down to earth and very skeptical about UFO sightings, but this was one experience that I can't explain.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
