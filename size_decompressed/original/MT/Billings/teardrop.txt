I thought, at first, it was the moon but it seemed to be moving slightly. We pulled over the car and I snapped pictures and some video with my phone. We thought it might be the Neowise comet since it was in the Northwest but eveeything we read said that we would not have been able to see that with the naked eye. We didn't stay. We went on to our hotel but when we tried to see it from there, it was gone. We thought maybe there was too much light at the hotel but we saw this right above the street lights so that wasn't the problem. We have looked on subsequent nights and seen nothing more.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
