We were on our roof in downtown Billings and saw a UFO crossing the sky from the Northeast sky to the Southwest Sky.  It passed between Orions Belt and the largest star to the south.  We could not see the shape of the vessel but it had two large round lights at the front and rear and both appeared to be orange/yellow in color.  The UFO could have been any shape but appeared to be oval or egg shaped since lights were only on the front and rear as it moved. It moved VERY quickly...much faster than any plane or other object we have seen.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Canon A3100IS Captures an Unknown Black Blur During Thunderstorm.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a bird, caught in flight.  PD));2011-08-10 19:34:00;1 sec;Canon A3100IS Captures an Unknown Black Blur During Thunderstorm Let me be clear.  I did NOT see this object with my eyes.  I was taking pictures of a thunderstorm in continuous mode and captured on ONE of the frames an oval black blur.  As far as I'm concerned, it could be a bird in flight, but it appears oval.  Unfortunately, the only frame with the object was taken without testing the average white balance before taking pictures of the thunderstorm so the color is off, but the object is clearly present.  I've also deleted all the other frames except for the one with the object, but none of those deleted frames preceding or following the frame with object showed the object.  I used a Canon A3100IS to capture something, likely a bird.  I'm only submitting this report because UFOs tend to appear during such electrical activity.
