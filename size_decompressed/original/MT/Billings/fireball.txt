Orange Red Fireball/Craft over Billings Montana. 2nd sighting this month.;2011-07-24 00:02:00;2 minutes;Orange Red Fireball/Craft over Billings Montana.  2nd sighting this month. I walked outside at midnight lit a smoke looked at where my July 4th sighting was west south west of Billings Hts. and the orange-red ball was just moving into sight-line it sort of appeared out of nothing,no clouds tonight,  I tracked a plane at the same time heading west and the difference was noticeable,the fireball moved in a manner that almost looked like it was hanging from something, it seemed to hover when it was due west of me and backtracked a little before moving to the west north west and just faded into nothing. The plane I tracked was still well within sight high to the west,and no trace of the orange-red ball.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Ten or more orange fireballs moving southerly along the east edge of Billings, MT.;2012-06-02 21:45:00;5 minutes;Ten or more orange fireballs moving southerly along the east edge of Billings, MT. On June 2, 2012, approximately 9:45pm mountain time, I was summoned outside by my brother. I exited the house, and looked east, where my brother was pointing at something in the sky. Three orange fireballs were clearly visible moving in what appeared to be a southern trajectory, although it may have been southeast or southwest. The lights would have been near the eastern city limits of Billings Heights. As we watched the first three crossing the sky, more continued to come into view, as several large trees blocked part of the sky from our sight. I counted at least ten. Most of them seemed to be moving in a line with each other, althrough three of them formed an irregular triangle formation. At one point two of the orbs came close enough to eachother that they appeared to touch, before swirling around eachother for a moment. The lights all made their way across the sky, eventually fading into some cloud cover. The entire incident lasted less than 5 minutes. The lights would best be described as orange fireballs. Their size was quite a bit larger than any star or planet would appear, and they were clearly visible even though night had not quite fallen and the sky was still fairly well lit. There only appeared to be the singular orange source of light for each light. There were no additional or blinking lights that might suggest an airplane or helicopter. They appeared to be flying lower than most airplanes would fly.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Bright, glowing object at 5000 ft AGL.;2013-08-28 21:30:00;60 seconds;Bright, glowing object at 5000 ft AGL. I came back from the airport at 21:30, pulled in my driveway, was unloading the car and something bright caught my attention.  Initially, I thought it was an aircraft on fire traveling due south at about 5000 feet AGL.   Approximately the size of my thumb nail it came to a hover directly over me and hovered for approximately 30 seconds.  It then backed up roughly 3 arc seconds, moved west by the same amount, and then moved south east by about 4 arc degrees.   The object then started ascending due east eventually climbing over the clouds which were in the eastern quadrant of the sky in approximately 20 seconds.   I snapped a picture with my IPhone as it was ascending and then called for a weather briefing.  At the time of the sighting visibility was 10 miles,  wind 310 at 3, few clouds at 7,500, scattered at 12500.  Temp was 23C, density altitude 5400, and altimeter 3002.   Consequently, based on this weather report for 0339 Zulu for Billings, MT, I estimated the ! rate of climb from a hover (5000 AGl) to disappearing over the clouds at 12,500 giving it a rate of climb of approximately 22,500 fpm.   The object was circular, glowed brightly the color of a campfire, and made no noise.  The color of the object never changed during the 60 seconds of witnessing it.   For whatever reason, I feel that this object was unmanned and transitioned to a hover in order to  search for a navigation data point such as a magnetic field line or point of reference in order to begin a new displacement.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Red fire balls over Billings, Montana,;2014-06-28 00:00:00;Getting off work;Red fire balls over Billings, Montana, I was just getting off of work and as I look up I see these red fireballs moving around. These fire balls I seen were flying between the highway and the Sugar beet company.  These  fire balls lasted about a few mins.   I tried to drive closer to these orbs and they disappeared.  I call the police and made a report and asked if anyone has reported these orbs because they were so noticeable and the dispatch stated no one made the report.   I live in Laurel, Montana, and I have seen the star orbs in the sky that move and there is a lot of activity around here.  I have made one other report a few years ago in Laurel where across the street from where I live I saw a UFO triangle with seven red lights hovering over the trees.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
I saw a bright neon green fireball with a tail like a comet streak N through the sky toward the Billings Logan International Airport.;2016-01-02 20:45:00;3 seconds;I saw a bright neon green fireball with a tail like a comet streak through the sky north toward the Billings Logan International Airport for about 3 seconds until it appeared to burn out and crash in the sky at which time it appeared to be falling.   It went from neon green to orange, like something on fire, then smokey grey, and then black, at which point you could no longer see it.   My dad had just returned from the Holiday gas station where the cashier there had said to my dad what was that and then explained to him what he saw so when I was explaining it to him, he knew what I was talking about.
