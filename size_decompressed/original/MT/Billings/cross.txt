two black objects seemed like they fluttered;2003-02-18 18:20:00;several minutes;two black objects seemed like they fluttered At approximatly 1820 I was walking north shortly after sunset on a clear evening.  I noticed an airliner approaching far to the west.  Then I saw what appeared to be two black fluttering objects moving towards the east. They sort of dipped and weaved across the sky.  I noticed what appeared to be a small orange light coming from the rear of the objects.  I thought that they were stealth fighter aircraft, however, there were no lights and no sound.  They soon disappeared in the east. An commericial airplane took off from Logan Internation above the rims about this time.  This was the second time in two weeks that I have seen a strange object(objects) at the same location, at the same time (1820), moving in the same direction.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
A cross-shaped craft seen over Billings, MT.;2008-08-01 23:45:00;15 mins;A cross-shaped craft seen over Billings, MT. Date: August 1st, 2008 Time: 23:45 pm MST Location: 23rd floor, Crowne Plaza Hotel  Description of object seen: Began as a blinking, red light in the sky, which would shift over to a white color, then back to a red color.  Near the end of the sighting, the one light changed into 3 lights, colored red, green, and yellowish white. And, when bathed in the street light below, one could make out a cross like shape before the craft made it's exit from view. Object's Behaviors: Began as a blinking, red light in the sky, which, after seconds of sighting, began to drift to the left slowly then would STOP, change directions, STOP, and change directions again in a very erratic and sudden fashion, changing directions far too much and too fast to be of any known aircraft.  The red light would, at times, shift, or slowly turn into a white light at times, and in both modes, the light would suddenly flare, or would brighten drastically and then dim back down at random intervals and would appear to have sudden lashes of light whip from it, the color corresponding to the current color of the craft. Craft would not stay in just one general area, but would at times, move over to another area, fly about in that area, and would then return to the previous area to seemingly wander that area some more.  This was observed for approx. 14 mins. before the craft suddenly multiplied for a total of three 3 lights, a red, green, and yellowish light and began to approach closer to the western end of the town at a very quick speed, much quicker than most civilian helicopters I've seen about town.  And after a moment or so, I saw that the ambient light from the streetlights below had illuminated the underside of the craft, showing a white colored cross-like shape, before the craft swiftly flew far off over the horizon. Number of objects: One  Shape and Color: White cross shaped craft with red, green, and off-white colored lights. Duration of Sighting: approx. 15 mins. Witnesses: One, myself, station monitor in radio station on top floor of hotel building. Notes: All range estimates are based on pure conjecture and should not be considered to be ACCURATE data. It should be noted that I did call a friend during the sighting to describe the event.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
