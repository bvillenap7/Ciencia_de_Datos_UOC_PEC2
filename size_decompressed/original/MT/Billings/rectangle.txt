Rectangular white object hovers, flashed lights, disappears over Billings/ Laurel Montana, mid day, 7-16-11.;2011-07-16 12:00:00;20 minutes;Rectangular white object hovers, flashed lights, disappears over Billings/Laurel Montana, mid day, 7-16-11. after entering the interstate I90 from Zoo drive heading towards Laurel, I, in the passenger seat looked out towards the rims and saw a stationary white rectangle in the sky, looked like it would have been over towards the rims area.  It seemed to remain stationary.  I was able to maintain visual the entire time until we took the first Laurel exit.   At that point, as we were heading to the stop sign, the object flashed with several round lights across the front, then turned black, then back again to white.  I lost visual as we got onto the road that heads past the railroad to Walmart.   After shopping at walmart for approximately 30 minutes we left the parking lost of Walmart heading towards Bridger.  I glanced up and over the railroad area and saw a similar object that was still rectangular, but not as long and a little taller, not quite square, it seemed to be over the area where the high school would be or beyond, past it farther down the road maybe.  It flashed very bright and then disappeared.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
