Silver oblong object in the sky, turned to a light and back again.;2011-03-26 18:00:00;3-5 minutes;Silver oblong object in the sky, turned to a light and back again. My friend and I were driving back to my house after eating dinner and I was compelled to look up. I saw what I thought at first to be a jet liner way up and a bit of the chem-trails behind it, until I realized that it was not, in fact, a jet at all, but rather what I would describe as an oblong shape standing vertically in the sky with the sun reflecting off what appeared to be a silver surface. Neither of us could figure out what it was, so we turned to get a better angle. The object would go back and forth between its oblong shape and what seemed to be a small light. The light would fade, but never completely disappear, then it would go back to the shape we originally saw it in. Soon it quit returning to the oblong shape, and we saw what we at the time thought were two dark clouds about it, until we saw the clouds rotate around the light. Eventually, the light was no longer visible and we drove the rest of the way to my house with no further incidence.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
