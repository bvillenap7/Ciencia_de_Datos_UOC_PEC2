Glowing object appears to be  luminiscent balloon but dissappears rapidly to the SE at high speed.;2003-02-04 18:20:00;3min.;Glowing object appears to be  luminiscent balloon but dissappears rapidly to the SE at high speed. 6:20pm Billings, Montana.  Object looked like a ballon caught in the tree.  It glowed and seemed to be aluminated by the light of the moon(clear night but only a crescent moon).  Object moved across to the other side of the tree.  Really looked like a glowing baloon.  Object then moved away and actually was not near the tree.  Object then appeared to be a more oval shape with a reddish/white light appearance.  Object which originally appeared to be just above the ground then moved upward to the east and seemed to reach an altitude of several thousand feet, like an airliner.  The object then moved fast towards the east at what appeared to be the same altitude of a commercial jet, however, there was no sound at all.  The object dissappeared to the SE.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Shape changing craft above my house for 3 to 4 minutes!!;2013-06-15 02:15:00;3-4 minutes;Shape changing craft above my house for 3 to 4 minutes!! At 2:15a.m., my cousin and I were sitting out on my deck when my cousin said, “Oh my God!!  Look!!” and pointed at the sky.  There were 3 multicolored lights in a triangular shape in the sky to the southeast of us.  While watching this in amazement, the lights changed shape and became 5 lights in an elongated rectangular shape with a point on the end like a Star Destroyer.  This lasted for maybe 30 seconds and then all of a sudden the lights changed shape again and took on the 'classic' cylindrical “flying saucer” shape and started moving across the sky. After watching it slowly move to the east like this, the lights then changed into a 'star' shape, with at least 8 points I'm not totally sure how many points, but there were at least eight of them.  This object then started moving north, while still in the star shape, moving slowly to the north.  All of a sudden it picked up speed and shot away in an instant still moving north. This whole incident lasted approximately 3 to 4 minutes. I would like to say, for the record, I had not had a drop to drink and neither had my cousin, him being only 16 years old.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life and I will be looking for this object to come back into the skies above my house for years to come, probably!!;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
One round-ish object splitting into 4 in broad daylight.;2014-05-22 13:30:00;10 minutes;One round-ish object splitting into 4 in broad daylight. I heard a plane with a propeller and looked up and there was a round-ish silver object near it in my field of view but much higher up.   I focused on the object, thinking it might be a balloon and watched it for about 5-6 minutes.  It was flying or drifting toward the Southwest.   The object started jerking around and moving sporadically which made me watch it even more closely.   I then saw a plane in my peripheral vision flying almost right at the object from the East.   I looked at the plane and when I looked back the 'UFO' split into 4 parts and took on a different color, like a yellow-ish color.   Then the 4 parts just flew around with each other, sometimes it looked like one was leading the others and they were flying in formation or performing.   They were heading North and eventually got so far away that I lost track.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
