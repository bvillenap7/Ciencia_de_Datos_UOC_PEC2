3 individual lights flying at night straight up in the sky.;1993-06-01 22:00:00;20 seconds;3 individual lights flying at night straight up in the sky. 	This sighting happened in the summer of 1993 or 1994. 	My friends and I were playing cops and robbers, or hide and seek around the neighborhood.  I was age 13 and we were playing with my friends twin brothers who were 3 or 4 years younger and some of their friends. 	I was playing the part of the robber at the time and hiding out down the street sitting on a fence near the bottom horizontal support beam near the ground.  So while I was waiting for them to come and find me I was looking up at the sky.  Soon what caught my eye was really cool!  	I saw three individual lights which appeared to be the same size as the stars around them flying towards each other.  Two came from one side and one from the other.  I am not too sure the exact flight path because I was looking straight up.  But I was facing West so I think the two lights were from the North and one light From the South.  They stopped in the sky when they met up.  	I new the lights were not satellites because they didn’t keep on going.  They were also brighter then satellites appear in their orbits and flying as if controlled by something making adjustments and decisions. 	The lights then flew next to each other for a few seconds and flew around each other a bit as well.  They moved back all together now to the North just a couple of stars over.  Then joined together as one and shot away straight up into space. 	I didn’t even finish the game and ran back to the house to tell everyone what I just saw.

Two bright red lights moving in perfect formation flew over Billings on the evening of Jan.12, 1997.  They were flying at an altitude n;1997-01-12 23:00:00;5 minutes or less;SUMMARY:  Two bright red lights moving in perfect formation flew over Billings on the evening of Jan.12, 1997.  They were flying at an altitude normally too low for conventional aircraft.  Too slow for an airplane. . .almost as if they were gliding.  They made no sound. On the evening of January 12, 1997 around 11 pm I was at my girlfriend's house and went outside to try to start her car (it had been very cold that week and we had been trying to start it for a couple of days).  I went inside the car, tried to turn it on and it didn't start.  I got out of the car and two bright lights hovering over a set of trees caught my attention.  I knew that there were no lights (city or otherwise) that should have been there so I looked at them for a second or two.  They were really bright but at the same time kind of dull (hard to describe).  I moved a few steps away from the car and they started to move in a northeasterly direction.  When I first spotted the lights they were probably 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away.  I ran inside and told my girlfriend to come out and check them out.  She got on her boots and saw them but went back inside because it was at least 10 degrees below zero outside.  I ran out onto the street and followed their flight path.  They fl!ew from a southwest to northeast direction and were probably 60-70 degrees off of the horizon.  The two lights upon closer inspection appeared to be made up of more than one light, possibly five. . .occasionally they would blink (they blinked quickly, unlike any other airplane light I have ever seen)  The thing that struck me the most is how they stayed _perfect_ formation. . .not straying an inch from their formation.  It was as almost they were part of the same craft.  This might be the case, but if this is so that means that this craft was at least the size of 2 football fields.  They were completely silent.  Billings is set against a continuous series of cliffs which are about 60-100 feet in height.  In comparison to the Rims (as they are called) they were about 200 feet off of the ground.  They were flying too slow for any airplane that I know  of (plus, as i said they made no sound)  It was if they were gliding.  I ran up a side street and watched them pass over the rims!and pass just south of the airport, if not right over it.  I watched them glide off until they went over the horizon.  It was very strange, as the entire time I knew this was something that I have never seen before in person.  I tried to call the airport to confirm any unidentified aircraft but couldnt get through.  If there are any questions please email me.  I can positively state this was not any conventioal airplane.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569

It hovered for long time.  hovered east of billings.  was during the hale bob comet present to the north.  As it climbed the light dimished and gained speed then shot staight up and curved like it was going into orbit then shot to the east in a beautiful curve as it gained massive speed. fastest thing i have ever seen had to be moving thousands of miles an hour but did not make any sound at all.

It was a reoccuring visual object then followed by an occurrence of thunderous noise in the same area.;2004-08-16 21:00:00;5 minutes;It was a reoccuring visual object then followed by an occurrence of thunderous noise in the same area. We were camped on Buster Creek about 40 miles South of Billings, Mt. in a rural setting approximately twenty miles West of Yellowtail Dam in Montana.  I had a camp fire light and hanging lantern light in my eyes and still saw this extremely bright blue-white light appear in the sky at about 35 degrees above the horizon almost directly east of our position. I called my wife to look and she and a son of 11 also saw it. It became extremely bright and huge, probably four times the size of the glowing Saturn. Then as if clicked off, it turned to a dot like the smallest star in the sky and turned southward. It proceeded that direction appearing as a satellite, until we lost sight of it. It made no sound and had no other disquishing lights such as wing markers or strobes on an aircraft as we know.  Then again on the next evening about 30 minutes later, the light appeared in the same area, shining through a layer of clouds. I could see no other stars in the sky due to the clouds. Again there was no noise or other lights. This time two other adults saw it. When the bright light dimmed as it did the previous night, we could not track it due to the clouds.  Then on the night of the 19th of August we had company of two attorneys and one of their spouses at our camp. They were all from New Mexico. We were eating a late meal when we heard two loud booms like dynamite going off in the sky followed by a three thunderous, rolling booms that shook the earth, trees and camp tent. The enormous thunderous roll then turned to a vibrating thunder sound which then receded. I have never in my 60 years heard anything to compare this vibrating thunder sound with. I am also a pilot and have heard sonic booms. This was almost frightening in comparison. Relatives of ours also heard this noise 20 miles distant but thought it was thunder as they were inside their homes. Another ranch couple only a few miles away were rattled in their bed by what they could only describe as thunder from somewhere. We at the camp had a clear view of the entire night sky and there was not a cloud from horizon to horizon.  I have no idea what any of this was including the light. It is strange to have three unusual events in such short time frames and in the same area. I have been in that area for most of my life and have never witnessed anything similar.  We are just hopeful that maybe someone else saw the same things and can bear witness to what we saw and heard. Neither the light we saw nor the sound are anything I can say was normal no matter how much I try to reason it out. We were somewhat reluctant to post this but will never hear from anyone else unless we do.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
5 lights in the sky, one dripping blue sparks, incredible flash;2006-06-06 23:25:00;35 minutes;5 lights in the sky, one dripping blue sparks, incredible flash Peter, I heard you tonight on Ground Zero and was relieved to hear you ask for reports, whether they happened last night or 80 years ago.  I had an experience in 2006 that had a major impact on my view of reality.  I don’t tell many people about it, but thought that if it might aid your research that I would share it with you. On June 6, 2006, I went out into my back yard to have a cigarette.  I went outside at about 11:00 pm.  Three hours earlier there had been a thunderstorm that went through the area.  I am a bit of an amateur astronomer, and I truly enjoy viewing the stars at night.  On this particular night, the sky had been washed clear by the storm and the western night sky was gloriously filled with stars.  I remained outside to let my eyes acclimate to the darkness so I could see the stars better.  The arms of the Milky Way were solidly visible.  I must admit that I was a little excited. At about 11:25 pm, I noticed movement to the south about 20 degrees off of the ecliptic.  There were three white lights in the shape of a triangle, moving in concert from south to north.  I smiled, amused that the sky was so clear that you could even see satellites passing overhead.   Suddenly, the thought occurred to me that satellites don’t travel in packs of three.  Perhaps the International Space Station I rationalized.  Satisfied with this rationalization, I continued to watch the lights steadily traverse the sky.   As the lights reached approximately the center of Corona Borealis (although they were much higher in the sky), there was a brilliant white/blue flash.  The flash was elliptical in a vertical orientation.  The flash was so bright that it faintly illuminated the entire neighborhood.   I did a double take, unsure of what I had just seen.  I looked at the spot where the flash had occurred, and one light was continuing on the original trajectory to the north, at the! same speed as before.  One light had disappeared, and the third light had reversed course and was headed south.  It appeared to be (the best way I can describe it) “dripping” blue sparks and traveling in a jagging fashion.   I watched it in disbelief for about 15 seconds and then returned my gaze to the light traveling to the north.  Just as I acquired its location, the light sped to the horizon, covering roughly 1/3 or the sky, in literally the blink of an eye.  It disappeared beyond the horizon, out of my field of view.  I quickly looked back to find the light that was traveling to the south, and it was no longer visible. I ran into the house, excited at what I had just witnessed.  I was headed to the bedroom to wake my wife, but reason got the best of me.  What was I going to do, wake her out of a sound sleep to tell her that I saw lights in the sky that aren’t there anymore?  Logic settled in, and I returned to the back yard. I anxiously stared into the sky, sweeping the path that the lights had followed.  Nothing… I remained outside, enjoying the stars once again.  About 10 minutes later, two lights appeared, traveling along the same route as the original three.  They were side by side, and seemed to zig-zag periodically.   I figured that perhaps my eyes were becoming fatigued and that it was my eye movement that gave the appearance of the sudden jerky motion.  I used a 4x4 post on the deck for reference and watched them carefully.  They were indeed zig-zagging periodically.  There was no discernible pattern or time period that seemed to accompany the sudden jerky movement.  Perhaps these were satellites or the ISS I rationalized.   They continued on at about the speed and perceived elevation of a satellite.  The two lights continued, side by side, from south to north until about 10 degrees above the northern horizon.  Suddenly, both white lights glowed brilliant red and zipped off in opposite dire! ctions, one headed west, and one headed east.  Nothing else happened in the next hour, and I retired to bed. I realize that this is a little late to the party and probably won’t do you much good in your quest.  But I really did have to tell someone that wouldn’t judge me as some kind of whack job.  It was cathartic even though it probably wasn’t of much use.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Very bright light, slow moving object that made no audible noise.;2008-02-03 19:30:00;5 minutes;Very bright light, slow moving object that made no audible noise. I was on the front porch when I saw a bright light moving very slowly in the sky that did not resemble a plane or helicopter traveling west to east.  Our property is often flown over by both types of aircraft (planes and helicopters).  This was a very bright white light that did not flash.  Was brighter that a normal spot light or landing light.  There was also no red or green flashing as on other aircraft.  The craft appeared to be lower than the cloud cover.  There was cloud cover but not dense, could still see stars through the clouds. The object made no noise, in fact as I was watching this object a regular aircraft flying from the east to the west flew over and was at a higher altitude and I heard this plane with no problems.  Continued to watch the unknown craft until it disappeared to the east.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Light moving slowly in a circle outside Billings;2010-10-20 21:00:00;15 mins;Light moving slowly in a circle outside Billings It was around 9:00 pm October 20th, 2010. I had just arrived home and was sitting in my car in my driveway talking on the phone, when a circular light appeared in the sky towards Laurel. At first I thought it was a plane, but it soon became clear that it was not. It was lower than a plane or helicopter, and moving extremely slow, so slow it was almost hovering. It was moving slowly in the same circular patch of sky, changing directions every few seconds. I watched it doing this same thing for around ten minutes. Then got out of my car, and continued to watch it from outside. It appeared as if there was multiple lights shining from the object, but not flashing or colored like an airplane. I then ran into the house and got my Mom, by the time we got back outside it was a little further away, but still visible and doing the same thing. She confirmed it was not a star or airplane, or anything like she had seen. The whole event lasted at least 15 minutes, and we went inside before it disappeared so it could have been there much longer. I am still in awe over the entire thing and know it was unlike anything I have ever witnessed before. I am 21 years old and have never in my life bought into the whole UFO phenomena, but I have no other explanation for what I witnessed last night.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569

On the evening of July the 4th, approx. 10:15 PM.  Over the Yellowstone River.   Myself and my wife both observed from our home red-orange crafts appear in the far southwest sky, and slowly move and hover over Castle Rock Park during the fire works show.  There were at least 6 separate crafts that would appear and move slowly, then disappear at the cloud to the north-northwest, and almost instantly reappear to the south west again and again. This event lasted til 11pm. I cannot explain what it was, but it was not fireworks or any aircraft I have ever seen.  Its movement was smooth and deliberate, 1 craft hovered for 15 minutes before heading into the cloud, which was the only cloud in the sky that night.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569

I looked at the sky and noticed a very bright light coming from the west as it came into view over the roof of my house.  It moved at a steady moderate rate of speed and didn't vary course.  I thought it was a satellite but it appeared much brighter and much lower. It travelled in a straight direction (east) as a satellite does but after watching it for about a minute or two it went up!  It travelled  at a considerable faster rate as it rose up and eventually went out of sight. It was the same color as a star or sattelite and I assumed that's what it was till it changed direction. It didn't change course and rise gradually, it simply reached a point and rose almost in a 90 degree angle. I was stunned and wish I knew what it was!;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Ball of light at high velocity and frightning rate of descent.;2011-12-19 18:15:00;7 seconds;Ball of light at high velocity and frightning rate of descent. While driving east down a side street, I noticed a falling ball of yellowish/white light arcing east over Billings with an estimated descent rate of 10,000 fps and a speed exceeding 1000mph.  Estimated altitude upon initial contact was 8,000 AGL.  The object was not an aircraft as it did not have anti collision lights and its rate of descent was frightning.  The object was not a meteor as its parabolic trajectory was too steep to march the Earth's curvature.  Contact was lost as the aircraft disappeared behind trees lining the street.  I am a science teacher, pilot, and very familier with the physics of flight.  What caught my attention was the high velocity and rate of descent which covered a 70 degree sky arc in approximately 7 seconds.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
Approx. 7 lighted objects in a Northeast to Southwestern travel pattern above Billings Heights.;2012-03-24 20:28:00;8 minutes;Approx. 7 lighted objects in a Northeast to Southwestern travel pattern above Billings Heights. The objects started above the horizon northeast of my residence as bright orangish light.  It started as two visible lights zig-zag from one another traveling in a southwestern direction.  The lights did not appear to have any type of vibration to them, and appeared to alternate between red/white light fast enough to appear orangish in color.  The objects continued southwest to directly east of my residence where I noticed several more on the horizon following.  The objects were traveling slowly, and the lights on the first two to three faded as they reached an area east of my residence.  The other objects continued in the same direction, extinguishing their lights at different locations in the sky, not being seen again.  At this time I noticed what appeared to be an airliner in a east to west flight pattern extremely high in the sky.  The last two objects were on a path to intersect visually at some point above my location with the airliner.  The last two o! bjects both slowed or possibly stopped in the air, and made a very smooth vertical climb, and extinguished their lights not to be seen again before reaching an intersecting point with the airliner.  There was absolutely no noise from these objects at all, and they were possibly around 1000 to 2000 feet AGL.  The night sky is clear, there is a partial moon, and many stars tonight.  The temperature is in the upper 30's to low 40's, and a slight breeze.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569

3 bright red lights over Billings, Montana.;2014-04-03 20:20:00;1 minute;3 bright red lights over Billings, Montana. This evening (4/3/2014) at approximately 8:20pm I went outside and seen 3 bright red lights in the sky as I faced in the Southern direction.  The three lights were heading towards me going north.   At first they were moving horizontally together.  The object on the left seemed to slow down and immediately started to fade out.    While this happened the object in the center made two sporadic movements.  It seemed to slow down and then move to the right and back to the left.  The object on the left continued to fade until I could no longer see it.  While fading in brightness, it still remained red.  I ran to my brother’s house next door to mine and rang the doorbell.   I continued watching the lights and the two remaining lit up objects began to fade at the same time.  My brother and his wife came outside but by the time they looked up the lights had faded.   I continued watching and in the horizon I could make out two objects that looked like parachutes getting closer to the ground.  They were far away from where I was but if they continued to fall they would have landed on the rims here.  Logan international airport is on top of the rims and would have been extremely close to the area where these object were heading.   I continued to watch in the sky for about 10 more minutes but did not see any other activity.  I came in my house and did not know who to call but remembered the UFO hotline that I heard about from Coast to Coast.   I called and gave a brief statement on the phone.  I called KTVQ news station here in Billings, but the lady I talked did not hear of any sightings or strange lights in the sky.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569

Yellowish/orange light observed by two people following a jet airplane.;2016-06-23 22:55:00;1 minute;Yellowish/orange light observed by two people following a jet airplane. UFO REPORT:  On June 23, 2016, my buddy and I were talking outside the shop building where we work the night shift.  It was a clear night sky with stars visible everywhere.  I heard the jet engines of an airplane so I looked straight up and it was directly above me and it was being followed by a yellowish/orange light.  I said, “Holy ((deleted)), look at this!”   My buddy jumped out of the chair he was sitting in and looked up.  I said, “There’s a light following that airplane!”  He confirmed that he saw it too. I estimate the airplane was approximately at 20,000 feet.  I say this because normally when jets fly overhead at 40,000 feet by the time we hear them they are already past us and high enough up that all you can make out is the blinking lights.  This plane was low enough that I could see the outline of the plane itself, and as soon as I heard it I looked up and it was directly above us. The light was about the same size as the stars in the night sky and was following the plane at about two airplane lengths behind it, and did not appear to be attached to any other object as I could clearly see the stars without anything blocking them out in the background.  The light was not blinking and remained constant.   As we watched, the light appeared to move under and ahead of the airplane.  Then it got closer to and moved ahead of the plane, got closer to the front of the plane and moved ahead of it again several times. I looked at my fit bit and noted the time was 10:55 P.M. Mountain Standard time.  I also noted the plane and light were moving from east to west. After about 40 seconds of observing the plane and the light, my buddy noted that the airplane's navigation light began blinking.  Up until then we had not seen the lights on the plane blinking. I can’t say for certain, but I suspect the plane was a B-1 bomber flying out of Elsworth Air Force base from Rapid City.  They fly into our airport often and the roar of the engines are unmistakable.  This plane had a similar sound to the engines. After about one minute we lost sight of the plane and the light. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  He said that he would try to induce the other witness to submit a report, as well, but he was not confident that the individual would be willing to do it.  PD));45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569

Brilliant White Light Expanded and Dimmed;2017-10-12 20:00:00;5 minutes;Brilliant White Light Expanded and Dimmed. 10/12/11, 8:00pm, clear sky, no clouds.  Sunset at 6:32pm  I was outside in my backyard and looked up to the north.  I saw a stationary brilliant white light in the sky.  It appeared to get bigger and brighter.  I thought I was seeing a star explode.  I located the Big Dipper and the North Star in the sky.  This object was down to the right of the North Star and almost level to the second star that points the way to the North Star.  It was the length of my index finger away from the North Star.  It stayed in the same location for about two to three minutes, then slowly dimmed away to nothing over about 20 seconds.  I continued to watch, but could not see anything in the sky close to that spot afterwards. I have seen airplanes that shine a bright light as they are coming toward you that appear to be stationary.  But they eventually move and you can tell it’s a plane.  If it were a helicopter, I did not hear any noise.  Would a helicopter light take 20 seconds to dim?  This was the brightest light that I have ever seen. I have also watched satellites and the ISS fly overhead.  Sometimes they catch the sun and shine brighter for a bit, but you can see that they are moving and can still follow them when they dim.  I am not sure how long it was in that location before I saw it, but it stayed stationary for the few minutes that I watched it before it dimmed away.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569

Very high up in the sky and moving very fast. Some in formations, some only in a line. Too far up to video. Some have stopped and then started moving the opposite direction East to West.;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
I was looking to the north sky, and that's when I saw a satellite moving.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-28 22:00:00;45 minutes;My girlfriend, and I were sitting on the back patio this evening. I was looking to the north sky, and that's when I saw a satellite moving west to east.  Not far behind the first light was a second light that was about 50 miles behind in the same pattern. Then others started to follow. One behind the other. I would say well over thirty.  Just south of the paterned lights. The same looking lights appeared, and moved in a very unconventional way. Making circles, moving at high rates of speed, and stopping on a dime!;45.7919567849686;-108.559426513569
