3 large pink flashes of circular pink light;2018-07-20 22:30:00;12 seconds;3 large pink flashes of circular pink light We were at the Great Falls, Montana, stock car races, and at about 10:30 PM,..  My boyfriend saw a huge pink circular flash and pointed it out to me, I looked over right away and saw nothing. Within a couple seconds I saw another large pink flash..  (Which he later told me the first one was twice as large.)  And then saw the first one disappear, followed by another teensy but smaller pink circular flash.  And then there were no more.  We live in a town with an Air Force base, which is on the complete opposite side of town.  The flashes were near the airport, but we both agreed there was no way it could have been any kind of identifiable aircraft.  It flashed at us 3 times total, with each flash becoming smaller as we watched.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549
