falling star that exploded into green sparks;2005-01-25 18:25:00;two seconds;falling star that exploded into green sparks On January 25, 2005 at 6:25 p.m. I was driving north on Interstate 15 approximately 14 miles north of Great Falls, Montana when I saw  a falling star ahead of me through the windshield.  The object fell approximately at a 35-40 degree angle for about 2 seconds then exploded/fragmented and the sparks or fragments were of a green color.  It reminded me of an exploding fireworks.  The location in the night sky was to the N.E. of the place where the sun set.  In my windshield as I drove north it was in the top left part of my windshield.  There was a star in the sky nearest the horizon and the falling star was located between the star and the horizon.  I am guessing that what I saw was a fragmenting meteorite that hit the earth’s atmosphere.

4 dull orange colored orbs heading SW split into pair formation. No sound.;2012-12-13 21:15:00;10 seconds;4 dull orange colored orbs heading SW split into pair formation. No sound. Was watching meteor shower n what appeared at first to be 4 shooting starsI quickly relized they werent stars not only because of their color and size but how they moved across the sky.  They were a dull orange color and soon in two sets and then they did a zig zag motion and disappeared.   I was really pretty freaked out bout astonished at same time.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549
I saw a green glowing fireball.;2015-09-26 19:40:00;2 seconds;I saw a green glowing fireball. I was sitting out on our patio with my wife.  We live 6 miles south of town and night viewing is very good.  We were chatting and something caught the peripheral vision in the upper corner of my left eye.  I looked up just in time to see a green glowing ball descending very rapidly.  I saw it for perhaps 1-2 seconds and then it disappeared down into the valley behind our house. I then looked up into the sky and saw what appeared to be the remnants of a smoke trail high overhead.  The moon was a super moon so the trail was easy to see.  It appeared to line up with the path I think the object took.  However, there were a lot of jet contrails in the sky that night.  My wife and I had been talking about that, and thought maybe the bright moon was just showing them more easily than normal.  So I can’t be certain that what I saw was the trail. Perspective was tricky, and I found myself wondering if it was actually several miles away and larger than I initially thought.  It is impossible to say.  But I have never seen anything like this before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549
