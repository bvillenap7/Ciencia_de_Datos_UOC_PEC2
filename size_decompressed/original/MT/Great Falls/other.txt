Three day sighting spectacular!;2005-10-05 21:30:00;3 hours;Three day sighting spectacular! Just moved here from Fresno CA.  I have had only 2 other sightings in my life.  None of which compared at all to what I have seen on the dates of 10-05-05 through 10-07-05.  The first night, I was stuck outside of the house (keys were not made yet) waiting for my girlfriend and her family to come back home.  We live in a residential area nearby the airport, and Malstrom AFB is about 10 or so miles away.  Around 9:30 pm, I saw 2 shapes outlines under the clouds.. pitch black.. large boomerang shape, no lights, not a sound.. at arms distance, they would be about the size of my hand.  One was slightly smaller, or further away.  I have no idea how high the clouds were that night, but I felt they were close.  I didn't think much of the sighting at first.. there were lots of large birgs flying south, and I had seen them in the day time, flying in similar formation.  But I kept my eye in the sky.   About 5 minutes later, a few more went nearly overhead, no sound, same shape.. but these were not birds, or crazy hang-gliders.  They seemed to be going to slow to stay in the sky, but really how  can you know how fast they are going.  After that.. I saw something that made me scream literally... And cuss... just a bit.  A triangle shape, with two rows of lights on all sides came just over a nieghbors house, about 200 ft. down the road.. silent. Then stopped completely, and stood up as to show off... and sat for maybe 3 or four seconds.. and faded into the stars...  I am surprized I didn't get shot at for yelling like that.. my heart was pounding.. and no one else was seeing this.  After some more sightings.. and around 10:00.. the family pulled up, and I told them what I had seen. After a few jokes...haha, and unloading the car at light speed, I was out in the driveway again.  My girlfriend stayed inside. I ended up seeing something 32 times that night.  The next night about 16, and the last night, I stayed up until past 4 in the am.. and saw roughly 44 of these... altogether, a a few triangles, and even a circle shaped craft.. my girlfriend and I together have seen well over a dozen... and even her mom saw one nearby.. and well, shes not one to give in easily...  I know the airbase is nearby, but the people here say that the runway at the base is shut down, and they are flying out of the airport... Unfortunatly, I haven't seen anything since...  I believe these are not experimental.. and why would they fly them right over the city all night... Electric City at that.  I don't have internet access my self, but I had to get this report down.. so I am at the library.   If you have any other questions, or any other reports of this, please contact me .. I know others have seen these craft... unless the people here didn't look up on those days.  Have a great day!  ((name deleted));47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549
Strange lights seen under super moon eclipse photo.;2015-09-27 20:56:00;One frame;Strange lights seen  under super moon eclipse photo On 9/27/20015 I was taking photos of the super moon eclipse hear in Great Falls, Mt.  I starting at 19:30.  I have a shutter timer set on my camera so it will automatically open the shutter in 30sec intervals. I was using a Canon EOS Rebel T2i camera. I started shooting at a about a f.22 at 1/10 sec at 400 ASA and went up as it got darker.  I have been doing photography about 45 years.  And I'm a avid UFO and Paranormal Investigator hear in Great Falls, Mt.   I took 406 frames that night of the moon to make a time laps movie.  As I was going though all of the frames.  There was one frame that caught my eye. It was on frame 345 there was a anomaly in the bottom right about 5 o'clock of the moon.  This I have no clue what it is.  It is not in any other frames.  When I enlarge the photo you can see a lot of different colors. It was not a Meteor breaking up.  I think a lot of people would have seen that.  Not a plane It would have been in at least one other frame too.  It was a! bout a 1sec exposure.  I don't know if anyone else has seen this too.  this happen within a 30sec per frame.  This is not the first time i have witnessed a UFO.  I have the times and date to them too. And a photo of one of the others.  I will send a report and photo on that later.

Bright gold light appears stationary over Great Falls, suddenly moves away large platform with red lights.;2017-10-24 22:00:00;5 minutes;Bright gold light appears stationary over Great Falls, suddenly moves away large platform with red lights. I saw a bright gold light in line with the lower handle of the big dipper.  The light was station keeping for about one minute.  The light increased as it sped east about one mile.  Once again stationary.  The light luminosity decreased and the light sped west until out of sight.  a platform with two bright red lights appeared at the same location.  Too far away to make out any details. So as the initial gold light sped west, the platform slowly moved eastward until out of sight.  The speed of the platform was much slower than the initial gold light.   Odd that the red lights illuminated and turned off in sync.  Not like a rotating beacon and the red lights were quite bright.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549
