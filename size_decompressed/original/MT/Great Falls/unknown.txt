Beam of light in field, no visble object and no noise, approximitely a mile or less away,;2000-04-24 23:30:00;3-5 minutes;beam of light in field, no visble object and no noise, approximitely a mile or less away, This sighting happened when I was 14. At the time I was living in simms, MT, and had a girlfriend that would sneek accross town and see me late at night. That night on her way over she told me that she had seen a UFO.  I was almost sure that she was making it up or that she saw a plane. It was dark and about 11:30 at night and we were in the backyard of my house talking when she pointed to a field about a mile away.  I looked over and I saw a white beam of light that was pointing straight down onto a field in the distance.  At first i thought it was a helicopter, but then i realized that wahtever it was, it was not making any sound whatsoever. the &quotcraft&quot sat there for a few short minutes and the light that was shinning down on the field suddenly dissapeared as if it were turned off like a light switch. I waited to hear something take off or noise after the light dissapeared but there was nothing.. it was just gone. I was scared and there are only two thing that I believe that it could have been. The first was miltary craft, like the black secret helicopters that dont make any nose that government might have, or I saw a ufo. The Memory is still pretty clear and I believe that I had a ufo encounter that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Light Explosion;2003-03-14 19:00:00;Seconds;While I was out jogging on Malmstrom AFB, right after sundown, I witnessed a light explosion.  This light explosion was 10 miles wide, and maybe 2 miles high.   After I saw the light explosion, I was expecting to hear something, or feel a shock wave, because of how big it was.  The explosion was that close, maybe 5-10 miles north of the city of Great Falls, Montana.  I didn't hear or feel anything.   At the height of the light explosion, there was faint red, orange, blue hue at the center of the explosion.  This was strange, and awesome at the same time!   Sorry, I forgot to tell you about this one, since it wasn't a ufo sighting.   That's all of the strange incidences I have for you.  I'll keep an eye out and let you know if I see more strange stuff.   I'm telling you, I'm not nuts, I'm a fairly normal individual!  I love this stuff!  If there was a way for me to make enough money to support my family and be involve with this stuff, I would do it in a heartbeat! Have a good one!   =:) ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same, seemingly credible, source.  It is very difficult to just cover expenses, in the field of UFO investigation.

5 or 6 elliptical lights appear in front of truck and then suddenly move over it and disappear;2004-10-15 06:55:00;seconds;5 or 6 elliptical lights appear in front of truck and then suddenly move over it and disappear My daughter (age 16) and I had a really surreal experience this morning.  I am not sure I can even describe it.  It had rained all night and was still raining, so I drove her to school. It was pitch dark, rainy, and maybe a little cloudy (hard to tell in the dark).  We are driving down a coulee in the country on a county gravel road.  Right in the bottom of the coulee, suddenly these six elliptical lights, all in a row, about windshield height, appear out of nowhere.  I thought they were faintly yellow.  My daughter thought they were white---not really bright, sort of like headlights in the fog brightness, but different shape.  We both braced because we thought we were going to hit something.  Then, just as suddenly, they seemed to go over us and were gone briefly.  They reappeared one more time in the same way as we went up the hill and then we never saw them again.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549
Craft with large yellow/reddish color light observed over Great Falls MT on July 4th, 2010;2010-07-04 21:45:00;2 minutes;Craft with large yellow/reddish color light observed over Great Falls MT on July 4th, 2010 To whom it may concern, I am a middle aged police officer and my wife works for an investment firm.  In my career I have seen many strange things, but this observation clearly tops them all as far as being unexplained.    On July 4, 2010, at approximately 2145 to 2155 hours, I was sitting near the bank of the Missouri River on the 300 Block of River Drive North in Great Falls Mt.  I was sitting with my family waiting for the city fireworks display that was set to start at approximately 2200 hours.  We were sitting on the east side of the river facing westbound where the fireworks display was going to be launched. As we were waiting for the show I noticed an aircraft flying eastbound over the city (Est. elevation 10,000 feet high).  Normally this would not be note worthy because we were sitting under the flight path of airplanes landing and taking off from the Great Falls International Airport.  This particular craft caught my attention because it appeared to flying too high to have just taken off from the runway.  Normally, I have noticed flights that don’t land at the airport fly on the outskirts of the city.   Also, I noticed an extremely large glowing yellow/reddish color light underneath the aircraft.  The light took up the whole diameter of the craft.  The light appeared to be the approximate size of a Boeing 747.  I observed no red or green tail or wing lights on the craft.  There was no apparent spotlight shining in front of the craft.  I also could not hear the craft’s engine.  It should be noted it was extremely windy and this could have had an effect on the sound waves reachi! ng my location.  The craft also appeared to be flying slower than a jet craft would have at that altitude that was not planning on landing. At this time, I pointed the craft out to my wife.  At the same time we both said we have never seen an airplane or helicopter that looked like that.  We debated over whether a satellite would have the same characteristics.   During this time there were approximately 15 people that were sitting near us on the riverbank.  Several of them were watching the craft also.  Some of their conversations were similar in nature to ours (Unknown names of the other witnesses). I continued to watch the craft as it continued eastbound until I lost site of it as it headed east past the city.  Great Falls has Malmstrom Air Force Base, Homeland Security Base, and the Montana Air National Guard.  My job has allowed me some access to these bases on occasion.  To my knowledge, none of the aircraft they fly looks like this.   After hearing about similar related sightings of this nature on July 4th on Coast to Coast, I felt compelled to pass on my observations.   I hope this information will help, I just wish there could be an explanation for what we observed.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549

Shooting star that slows down to an almost complete stop, continues to zig and zag across the night sky from north to south.;2019-10-01 01:00:00;15 seconds;Shooting star that slows down to an almost complete stop, continues to zig and zag across the night sky from north to south. Goose Bumps - My dogs got me up to let them out about 12:50 am on 10/1/2019.  I remember it vividly because the temp was about 20°F when I went outside in my gym shorts and t-shirt and instantly felt the cold on my bare feet.  One dog started barking at something, so that is why I went outside was to get her to quit barking and not wake the neighbors.  I’m waiting there for her at the edge of the deck (freezing my rear-end off) and I start viewing the sky to the west when all of the sudden I see a shooting star moving from north to south.  Way cool…but then all of the sudden, it slows down  then it darts off to the southwest and then again to the southeast and then again to the south in a zig-zag motion taking up about 2/3rds of the sky (estimated 1,000 miles in 15 seconds or less, that’s ~240,000 mph).  At that time, I’m not sure if the goose bumps on my arms and legs were being caused by whatever I just saw or the cold.  This was no droid or anything I’d e! ver seen in my life prior.  Like I said, it initially had the effect and brightness of a shooting star but was able to slow down then speed up and slow down as it zigged and zagged across the night sky.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549
6-8 white lights in a straight, horizontal line, moving very slowly west to east above the Missouri River near Malmstrom AFB.;2020-08-07 04:02:00;5 minutes;6-8 white lights in a straight, horizontal line, moving very slowly west to east above the Missouri River near Malmstrom AFB. Observed 6-8 white lights in a straight, horizontal line, moving very slowly west to east above the Missouri River on the east end of Great Falls, MT near Malmstrom AFB.  Lights remain fixed relative to each other, as if on one large object.  We see plenty of planes here and it was not a plane. We observed for about 3 minutes until the lights disappeared into a large cumulus cloud.  I did not hear a sound but my spouse did and says it was a faint humming sound.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549
