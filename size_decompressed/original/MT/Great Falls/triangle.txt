Large triangular craft observed over Great Falls Montana.;2001-12-29 03:00:00;4min;Large triangular craft observed over Great Falls Montana. At approximately 03:00 hrs on Dec 29th,01 a triangular craft was spotted on the east edge of town adjacent to the Malmstrom AFB (GFA). The craft was about 50 yards in total length and almost as wide. The craft appeared to be at an altitude of 50 feet, made no sound at all and was traveling at a slow rate of speed (approx 25mph)heading south east toward the Little Belt mountains. As theBlack craft flew over the point of observation, it was observed that it had a low glow of perimiter lights of pulsing greenish blue. As the craft exited over a small portion of the city it was opserved to dissapear or blend into the street lights rendering it unobservable with the exception that one could still make out the movement of the craft as it was blanking out the street lights when the craft got between the street lights and the point of observation. Once the craft exited the east notrheast portion of the city and proceeded over wheat fields the craft was no longer observable. It is interesting to note that in the local Great Falls news, we have had reports of cattle mutalations in the area.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549
Slow, low craft with bright lights in a triangle pattern- heavy wind- Great Falls, MT;2010-01-16 19:20:00;5;Slow, low craft with bright lights in a triangle pattern- heavy wind- Great Falls, MT I was walking out to my truck when 2 large lights in the distance caught my eye. I live on Malmstrom AFB and on a Sunday night, we don‘t normally have any air traffic and there are no active runways in this general area.  The lights were very low, just above the houses a few blocks away and almost looked like gigantic auto headlights.  It was coming from the South. I was surprised to see a plane flying so slowly and low in the area, but then it dawned on me that I’ve never seen a plane like that.   For a moment, I thought it might be a helo, but it was too large and didn’t move like a helicopter.  It was about the size of 3 average-sized houses.  It also had a blinking red light somewhere just above or below the 2 “headlights”. I stood and watched the craft and it very slowly banked SWest and as it turned, I saw 8 (I think) bright white/yellow lights shining from the underside in a triangular pattern.  It was completely silent and very slow and the lights seemed to be a bit hazy, possibly from the debris caught in the wind. It disappeared from my view as it moved away.  We also had a major temperature change today (it went from below zero F to about 60 F in a matter of hours- it happens in MT quite a bit)  Just before I saw the craft, the wind was so intense that I had to brace myself on my vehicle.  About 10 minutes after I saw the craft leave, the wind died down significantly.   I’ve worked and lived around aircraft for over 15 years and have never seen anything like this.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549

Kite shaped moderately fast moving and silent;2012-08-12 23:49:00;12 seconds;Kite shaped moderately fast moving and silent This is the third time I've seen this in the past year.  The first two times were also at night but only glimpses.  This time I watched in fly directly over my house.  It looked like a very large kite.  There appeared to be no lights and it was completely quiet.  I watched it bank a bit one direction.  Was definitely no bird.  Maybe a military drone?  One of the strangest things I've seen and I don't get creeped out by strange things, but this one just left my heir standing on end.  The other dates I'm not aware of as I thought maybe I was just seeing things like a shadow or something from a plane.  But this last siting has definitely convinced me that this is no shadow.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549

Massive in size with 4 faint orange lights.  Almost undetectable would not have noticed it but it blocked out Orions belt which I was looking at on the eastern horizon. Followed by an obvious aircraft with blinking lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549

I was doing dishes and I looked out my front window and saw three bright pulsing green and red triangular objects.  After about 3 seconds they flew sky high faster than any human made object and disappeared.;47.5002269430051;-111.287055958549
