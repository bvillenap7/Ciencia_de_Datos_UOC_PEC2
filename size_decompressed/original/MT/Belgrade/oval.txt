DISAPPEARING  CRAFT ALONG THE BRIDGER RANGE;2005-07-05 20:00:00;20-30 sec.;DISAPPEARING  CRAFT ALONG THE BRIDGER RANGE I HAVE A SECOND FLOOR APARTTMENT IN BELGRADE WITH A PORCH THAT HAS A PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE BRIDGER MOUNTAIN RANGE AND ALSO LOOKS ALMOST DIRECTLY OVER THE AIRPORT. I WENT OUT TO LIGHT MY BBQ GRILL WHEN AS I WAS GVOING OUT THE DOOR I NOTICED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A SMALL CESSNA STYLE AIRPLANE FLYING VERY CLOSE TO THE MOUNTAINS AND AT WHAT SEEMED LIKE A RATHER SLOW SPEED. I AM ALWAYS WATCHING PLANES AND THE SKY BECAUSE I'M VERY INTERESTED IN AVIATION AS WELL AS ASTRONOMY. I WATCHED CLOSLEY AS THE CRAFT MOVED FROM S.E TO N.W. WHEN SUDDENLY IT DISAPPEARED. I WAS SHOCKED AS I THOUGHT I WAS WITNESSING A PLANE CRASH BUT, THERE WAS NO SMOKE OR RESCUE DISPATCHED OR ANYTHING. THE CRAFT WAS FLYING BELOW THE ALTITUDE OF THE MOUNTAIN TOPS AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED , I NEVER TOOK MY EYES OFF IT AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE BRIDGER RANGE. THERE ARE ALOT OF FOLKS IN THIS AREA WHO HANDGLIDE AND SUCH BUT THEY DON'T FLY ON THIS SIDE OF THE RANGE AND IT WAS TO BIG TO BE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ITS NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN STRANGE THINGS IN THIS AREA.;45.7828;-111.1423
