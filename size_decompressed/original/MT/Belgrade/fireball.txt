6 orange bright glowing lights Belgrade...;2015-01-23 21:52:00;10 minutes;6 orange bright glowing lights Belgrade... At 9:52pm, I stepped out for a smoke, and in Manhattan, MT, I have been watching the LoveJoy comet, and in the direction of the Belgrade Airport, I see 2 orange glowing orbs rising straight up from the ground.   So I yelled to my step son to come outside and check this out, and they flew/floated.  They wasn't going very fast, and the flight pattern was definitely not an airplane or any other Flying Machine the 2 crossed like they was confused and then 4 more came up from the ground in a vertical flight flying very close to each other still at a slow pace and headed straight up toward the east and disappeared into the cloud cover. I took a little video my camera sucks and the battery was dying, but I caught a couple of them on video at least they made no sound at all just 6 bright orange burning lights;45.7828;-111.1423
