Unidentified flying bright orange triangle 20 miles north of Belgrade, Montana in late summer of 1992;1992-08-01 12:00:00;few minutes;Unidentified flying bright orange triangle 20 miles north of Belgrade, Montana in late summer of 1992 My sister and I were walking up a hill to the shop where our father was working when something cought my eye over the mountians.  When I looked I saw a bright orange triangle hovering over the mountian.   There was no sound.  It was a perfectly clear day no clouds at all.  I would say it was the size of a car, but it's been over ten years so it's hard for me to remember.   I grabbed my sister's arm and we both stopped and stared at it for what seemed like a few minutes, but it could have been only seconds.  And then it just shot straight up into the sky.  No noise or anything.  We ran home and told our mother who said we were full of it.  I recently saw a show on ufos that talked of a triangle shaped space craft and had to report this.  I was 12 at the time and my sister was 7. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));45.7828;-111.1423
