3 lights with aura no tail steaking torwards same location;2016-09-14 00:30:00;2 seconds;3 lights with aura no tail steaking torwards same location I was driving west on I-90. First light I seen I was at the nine mile exit.  It streaked across the sky south to north. It started bright white then bright green lasting 2 seconds. No tail visible. Thought that was a cool shooting star. 15 miles west I seen another one that got me thinking. It was bright white, no tail, lasting 2 seconds.  This one however moved in a curved crescent shape what seemed to be low and around a mountain south to north. The third was 2 miles down the road around the corner.  It too was bright white, no tail, lasting 2 seconds. Straight line south to north and low as well.  All 3 lights seemed to be heading towards the same spot.  They didn't look like a normal shooting star. They had a aura around them like a headlight on a car at night does.  Im not sure what they were.  Just seemed really weird that one would curve.   Im a truck driver and drive mostly at night and have witnessed lots of other lights in this area, but not like this. Maybe note worthy?  A half hour later i noticed a weird cloud in the sky south of I-90. It was steaks and streaching.  Wider to the north going to a point in the south.  Other then those it was a clear night with almost a full moon that illuminated the streaching cloud.;46.9806;-114.4921
