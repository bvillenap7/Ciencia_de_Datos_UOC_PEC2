Orange pie shaped object;2019-03-15 03:48:00;5 minutes;Orange pie shaped object At 3:48am saw an orange, pie shaped object that was stationary.  It slowly shrank in size.  As it got smaller it turned red and the object looked like a firefly.  It continued to get smaller until just a small circle and then gone. It never moved, just became smaller.  The position would have been over the Fort Harrison area.;46.6029;-111.907
