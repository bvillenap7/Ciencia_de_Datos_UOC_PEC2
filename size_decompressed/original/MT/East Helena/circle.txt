Heard three womb womb womb saw blue orb in sky heard the sounds three times again then was gone.;2012-07-22 03:00:00;very short;heard three womb womb womb saw blue orb in sky heard the sounds three times again then was gone I herd a womb womb womb sound, living so close to an airport and a military base i know all of the sounds that fly above my house.  This was a sound i had NEVER heard before.  I walked out side and looked towards the military base.  there was a blue orb in the sky.  It was the most magnificent color blue i had ever seen, nothing i had ever seen in my life.   I watched as the color floated above the base and once again i heard the sound womb womb womb,  I could never forget it.  The sound still haunts me. the light just diapered out of the sky without a trace.   I walked inside and asked the two people in my house if they heard the noise out side, they both had heard it. Tthe next night the same two were outside and saw something floating past our house, with military escort, soundless and lightless, flying lower than any plain or jet.  two days after the three of us were out side and saw strobe looking lights coming from the military base.   i have seen the same strobe lights from the base six time since. and since posting this same thing on a UFO sighting sight i have been harassed by constant phone calls from numbers that every time i call back it says its no longer in service.;46.6029;-111.907
