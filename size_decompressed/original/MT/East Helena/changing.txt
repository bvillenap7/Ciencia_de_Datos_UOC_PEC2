I awoke at 425am on 5/22/09. I went to my kitchen to make coffee.As I was looking out my kitchen window I saw what appeared to be a very bright light in the eastern sky.At first I thought it was possibly landing lights from an aircraft as I'm not to far from the local airport,but the more I watched the light I realized it was stationary.I continued to watch expecting it to move but it didn't seem to be. I went and found my binoculars and went outside my house to try to get a closer look.This light was extreamly bright.Looking through the binoculars the light was round in shape.As I was watching it the circle looked to split in two but not completely apart,forming a eight shaped object. Then it would go back to the original circle shape. I thought I saw what looked to be an orange flame or light emit from the bottom of the circle but I cannot be sure,it seemed to only last milaseconds.All the time I watched the object it only seemed to move slightly from left to right and possibly went slowly up over the entire time.There was no sound from the object as a plane or helicopter.It was dead silent. I took a couple pictures with my digital camera but they are not great photos at the distance was to far for this type of camera. I will send them to you anyway. After watching it for 45 minutes I went to my computer to see if anything was reported to be in the sky at that time but could find no info.When I went back to check on the object a few minutes later it was gone. I'm a 55 year old retired male.  I have lived in the house for 13 years and have never seen anything like this in my entire life.;46.6029;-111.907
