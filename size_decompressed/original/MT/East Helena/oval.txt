Sighting location:  East Helena Montana When:  December 31, 2012 Time:  11:55pm As I peered out my window to look at the fireworks an object in the sky caught my eye.  My first thought it was a plane coming in for landing but it’s color was different (flesh-orange color)  It was brighter than a typical aircraft and it was following the same traffic pattern as a plane landing from the East.  It stayed at the same pace coming straight across the sky.  I watched it for about 20 seconds before it went over my condo.   I ran out the back door to see if it was a plane that was landing, but it had gotten smaller as it was ascending into the clouds very fast, like vertically and there was no noise (it was a crisp cold night with a high scattered cloud cover)  It remained the same color and was bright all around it, not just lights in front and a tail light like an airplane.  It had lights all around it!   I yelled at my boyfriend that was in the bathroom to please come and see this!   He stammered out to the back deck when he did, it was ascending fast up into the high cloud cover.  I asked him did you think that was odd or what?  He agreed but wasn’t as astonished as me as he mostly got a glimpse.  Later I asked him what he thought and he said all he really saw was the orangey color and said he thought that was odd how it disappeared quickly.;46.6029;-111.907
