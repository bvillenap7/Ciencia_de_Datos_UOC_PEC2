star looking objects flying single file from the west to the north and dissapearing. ((Spacelink satellites.));2019-12-25 06:45:00;06:55;star looking objects flying single file from the west to the north and dissapearing. None below describe it Outside on the patio tonight and noticed in the sky numerous white star looking objects coming up from the west to the north single file in a straight line and then hitting a certain spot in the sky and disappeared.  At the end of the straight line two more came side by side and then disappeared at the same spot as the others.  Another came from what appears to be from the east going very very quickly to the west, and then disappeared.  When we noticed the first lights going single file they were moving very quickly.  Towards the end, they seemed to slow down.  Definitely not a plane as ironically a plane did go by and one of the lights appeared to cross right where the plane was in the sky.  We live about 4 miles from the Helena Airport.  However the lights began their single file from the west no where near the airport.  Any suggestions on what this would be?  There were more than 2o of then I counted.;46.6029;-111.907
