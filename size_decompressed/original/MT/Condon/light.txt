Unexplained bright light traverses back in tree line along a logging trail;2010-12-06 13:00:00;1-2 sec.;Unexplained bright light traverses back in tree line along a logging trail December 7, 2010   UFO Sighting (I believe)  Yesterday afternoon 12-6-2010 around 1 p.m. I saw a bright object South West of my bosses lodge in Condon, Mt. traverse from left to right ¼ of a mile away. I originally thought it was a snowmobiler riding down this logging trail back in the tree line.  However, I was curious due to the fact that the terrain along that logging trail dropped slightly in elevation approx. 20-30 ft. over a distance of about  100 yds. or so.   The object traversed the 100 yd. distance in about 1-2 sec. max..  The bright object I saw flew straight and did not drop with elevation.   So, I jumped on a snowmobile and rode out there only to find not a single trace of anything. I walked around the area which was about 2 feet deep in snow.  No tracks of anything.  I could only think that what ever I saw fly down that logging trail, never touched the ground. I can only say in closing that if it was a snowmobiler I would have not been able to see its headlight due to the fact the logging trail actually runs away from my bosses property, not parallel or towards it.   I’ve been a professional pilot for 31 yrs., I know what I saw. I’m in disbelief that I’m even writing this.;47.5097;-113.7075
