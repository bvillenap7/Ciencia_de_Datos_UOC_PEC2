Round shape, extremely bright white light, took off (up) when I told it to come get me. We were driving back from Columbus, MT on our way home to Ryegate, Mt. My husband was driving a new Ford '76 4-door pickup that we just purchased. I was driving our old pickup and trailing behind because I was watching this light that at first I thought was a very large star. It came towards the earth (because it got brighter). I drove slower because it didn't move like an airplane and I wanted to watch it. It would go a little ways. Stop. Direction didn't matter - did what it wanted. I could see my husband had driven up to the house, so I stopped to watch it. It was round and far enough away that I could not see any other distinguishing shapes or color - only a brighter-than-bright white light. Neither of us was doing anything and that was boring. Finally, I got out of the vehicle and looked up, held up my arms and said come get me! . . . .the darn thing took off. . . like up until it couldn't be seen anymore.(I showered and used deodorant soap that morning. Guess they thought I would be a waste of their time). ((name deleted)) (This is the first report I've ever made). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));46.274;-109.2762
