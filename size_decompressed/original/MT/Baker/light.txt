I was looking at this for a few minutes and then the light started to move out from behind the cloud and as it headed east it accelerated to a very high rate of speed and split off into six separate smaller bright orange lights. This was 22 years ago but I will never forget this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));46.359;-104.2663
