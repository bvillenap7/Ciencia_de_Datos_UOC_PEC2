I was walking from my home to where my wife works to pick up our van so i could get to work at approximately 05:30 in the morning.  I had made it about a half of a block when something cought my eye in the sky.   It was still dark, and what I saw appeared to me to be flashes of town lights on the bellies of geese flying above me.  But instead of being a v shape it was in a triangle and filled in with these flashes.   What caught my attention right away was geese make their honking sound while flying.  I heard nothing.  From the time I realized this I started counting seconds.  I counted approximately 40 seconds when it was out of sight.  The morning was completely overcast and the flashes were very low in the sky.  It appeared to be no more than 100 to 200 feet in the air.  Again it was pitch black out and overcast with no stars visable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
