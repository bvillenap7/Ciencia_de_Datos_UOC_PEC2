Object was rectangular in shape approximately 2 city blocks long by 2-3 stories high and emitting a bright white light from within from one end to the other. I estimate it was 1/2 mile from me at an altitude of approximately 1500 feet, flying a set trajectory from west to east down the middle of Fort Peck Lake at Fourchette Bay, speed approximately 100-150 mph. It made no sound on a particularly quiet night. I am in possession of a picture of this object.;48.2034;-106.6114
