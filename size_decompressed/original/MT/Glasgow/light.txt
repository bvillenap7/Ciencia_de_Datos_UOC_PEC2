Intense bright light seen for a few seconds.;2009-11-16 18:39:00;10sec;Intense bright light seen for a few seconds. Intense white light seen in the northern sky. Light was seen, and then just disappeared.  It was as bright as the space station which we saw pass overhead earlier.  This light did not move or moved extremely slowly to the north.  My girlfriend said it was moving, I did not believe so. It was there very bright and then disappeared.  I cannot explain it. if it were a satellite it would have to have been an extremely large one to compare to the space station.  It was not the space shuttle either, we watched it pass overhead earlier this evening and the NASA website indicated only one pass.  If it did move as my girlfriend said then it was moving from south to north, perpendicular to the shuttle and the ISS orbital track.  Was very interesting.  My first thought was that it was supernova but I think it would have lasted longer.  This is the second thing I have found to meet the requirements for such a report.;48.2034;-106.6114
