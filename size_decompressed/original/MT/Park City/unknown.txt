Unknown object over rural country town.;2007-04-15 23:30:00;4-5 minutes;Unknown object over rural country town. 	It was on the night of April 14, 2007 at roughly 11:30 at night. My sister and I were on our way home from dropping our grandmother and mother off at the casino for a little Saturday night gambling. We pulled into the driveway at our house, and I then proceeded to put the car into park. We stepped out of the car and began walking up the sidewalk to our patio door. Our sidewalk makes a 90 degree turn halfway up it. As we began to make our turn, I happened to glance to my left. 	What I saw amazed me. It was in the clearing of a tree that is diagonal from our yard. I could not tell what shape it was, since it was very dark out. All we could see were 3 extremely bright white lights, and 1 dimmer red light, and 1 dimmer blue light. The pattern went like this. White light, red light, white light, blue light, and then the last white light. 	My sister and I stood there captivated by it, and watched it for what must have been 4 or 5 minutes. The lights were so bright, that it hurt my eyes just to look at them, but I could not look away. My sister and I didn't know what to do, so my sister kept her eyes on it, and we got in the car and began to drive. We saw it, and then when we had to pass the tree, it disappeared. It was there one second, and gone the next. 	We drove for what must have been 15 minutes trying to find it again, but it was nowhere to be found. So when we could not find it, I got on my cell phone and called my mother. I told her to meet us outside the casino and that I had something major to tell her. When we got there, we proceeded to tell her what we saw. She asked me if I was finally a believer, since I had been a big skeptic before. Now I am a believer.
