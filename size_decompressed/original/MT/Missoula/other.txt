Missile shape left mountaintop without sound or lights disappearing into a black cloud .;2004-10-30 01:00:00;2-3 minutes;Missile shape left mountaintop without sound or lights disappearing into a black cloud . My father told me, a week later that he was standing outside about 1 a.m. scanning the hills in the full moon, which was behind him.  He noticed a large missile shape with two smaller missile shapes attached on each side, standing on end atop the adjacent hill.  It looked to be made of a yellowish metal in the moonlight. As he watched, it went up, without lights or sound, up into a cloud which was black. Then he got cold and went back into the house. It was about 23 degrees and crystal clear out.  The 'cloud' was oddly black since it was not silouetted against the moon but should have been lit by it.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Silent, erratic, ultra-fast tour over Missoula area of 3-5 copper-colored craft.;2009-08-31 19:45:00;1 minute;Silent, erratic, ultra-fast tour over Missoula area of 3-5 copper-colored craft. Completely silent and faster than anything I've seen fly-- circling the city from northeast to west clockwise, out of sight within a minute or so.  Near sunset, so the reflection seemed a copper color at first they were spread apart but then grouped tightly in a formation.  I thought it was birds at first but way too fast.  Most profound was how totally quiet it was.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Star-like appearance with amber light to top right.  Movements forward and back for half an hour.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2016-02-08 19:35:00;30 minutes;Star-like appearance with amber light to top right.  Movements forward and back for half an hour or so. High in the sky with a starlike appearance.  However an amber light to the top right beside the star. It made small movements, forward and back to position, over and over.  Its movement was easy to miss if you didn't stand still and watch.  Then it was very obvious. My husband saw this same appearance night before last, and it lasted about 10 minutes or so. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at a twinkling star, possibly Sirius??  PD));46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
