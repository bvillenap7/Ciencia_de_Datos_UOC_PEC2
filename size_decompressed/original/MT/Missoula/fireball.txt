Unexplained objects photographed over Mount Sentinel in Montana.;2002-07-15 20:01:00;1 minute;Unexplained objects photographed over Mount Sentinel in Montana. My wife and I are university students in Montana. It was an early Monday evening,July 15, 2002. The temprature had been in the low 90s all day. At approximately 19:40 hours, a brief summer thunder shower passed over our area. The heavy rain and thunder and lightening lasted about 15 minutes. At 19:55 hours the weather eased, and my wife resumed doing the laundry, at the laundry room across the parking lot from our apartment building. When she stepped outside, she looked to the east, and saw a double rainbow spanning Mount Sentinel, which is almost directly behind our building. She quickly ran inside, and grabbed her Sony Mavica digital camera. She then returned to the parking lot to photograph the double rainbow. She took approximately 24 pictures. On 4 of the 24 photos, we noticed what appear to be several fireball looking objects in the sky. My wife did not notice the objects in the sky while she was taking the photos. The objects were all very similar in shape, although sizes of the objects varied (due to distance?). Photos are available upon request.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
One bright ,dark pink, slow moving, orb went through my yard at 3am lasting 5 or so seconds.;2009-09-20 03:00:00;5-7 seconds;One bright ,dark pink, slow moving, orb went through my yard at 3am lasting 5 or so seconds. I saw a low-flying (approx. 20 feet from ground), slow-moving, bright, pink orb go northeast through my yard, into some tall trees next door and out of sight.  This orb was silent and had a wavy, indefinte, outer edge.  It looked hot, and after it left my sight I am pretty certain that I could see smoke trailing off.  I estimate its size to be similar to a basketball, however the indefinte wavy edges make it hard to be certain.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Glowing orange fireball over Missoula, 10:30 p.m., July 1.;2010-07-01 22:30:00;3 minutes;Glowing orange fireball over Missoula, 10:30 p.m., July 1 It was a glowing, orange fireball flying low.  At first I thought it was fireworks or a bottle rocket but quickly determined it wasnâ€™t.  I thought a plane was on fire or something like that.  It glowed bright orange, like fire.  It moved slowly south east, again, flying low.   It made no sound or left any trail.  It lasted long enough that my partner and I could move to the driveway to get a better view.  It continued on its path until it was too far away to see anymore.   This object was seen by a university professor and a university staff person.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
8 flaming red lights moving across the sky.;2014-02-12 20:40:00;5 minutes;8 flaming red lights moving across the sky I received a phone call from my brother that there were strange lights in the sky.   I immediately ran outside and had a look.  I witnessed 4 bright flaming red lights moving from west to east across the sky.  They were in random positions and seemed to slowly fade out of sight when they disappeared from view.  Some were moving more vertical and some more horizontal than others.  The objects were traveling at least as fast or faster than any commercial aircraft I see in the area.  As these first 4 objects were moving and fading from sight at different times, 2 more came up over the horizon and followed a similar path.   My brother pulled up at this moment and we watched the objects as he filmed one with his camera.  The footage did not turn out very well due to lighting and camera quality.  Another 2 objects came up over the horizon from a different position approximately 5 miles away fro where the others originated and moved over the sky on my other side.  I had to turn 180 degrees to watch them.   I got my neighbors outside and they got to see the last one as well.  The objects maintained a steady trajectory with only a smooth change from vertical to horizontal.  As far as backgrounds my brother and I are both college educated civilians.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222

Very visible and bright, with long tail and 2-3 second viewing. We were sitting on our balcony facing south.  There was a bright blue flash that lit up a cloud over Missoula.  Then a blue fireball, with a tail approximately six times the length of the main body, fell at 45 degrees towards the southeast section of the city.

Seen by 2 people in Missoula, Montana, at approximately 23:50  there where 3 fireball looking crafts hovering with no sound.;2016-09-27 20:50:00;5 minutes;Seen by 2 people in Missoula, Montana, at approximately 23:50  there where 3 fireball looking crafts hovering with no sound. I was rocking my son to sleep, when I looked out the window and saw 3 dark orange red in color circular crafts hovering over the mountain top.  I told my wife to turn around and she did and asked what they where.  I said I didn't know and we went out side to get a better look.  There was no sound in the sky and the 2 just hovered while the one on the far left rocked back and forth from left to right than after a couple minutes it disappeared.  The one that was in the middle started moving up and down than with great speed it disappears and the one on the far right just vanishes right there my wife took a video.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
