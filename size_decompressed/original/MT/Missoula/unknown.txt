Object falling from the sky east of Missoula;2007-06-19 20:10:00;approximately five second;Object falling from the sky east of Missoula I saw a sparkling object fall from the sky east of Missoula. I was facing East out of an office window when I noticed a sparkling, shimmering, and glittering object moving vertically. If you were looking east from downtown Missoula, it would have fallen right down into Hellgate Canyon (although possibly further away). It appeared to be either reflecting sunlight off of different surfaces as it spun and/or tumbled or generating a blinking, irregular light bright enough to be seen in bright daylight. I can’t honestly give any more description.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222

When we took our little dog out for her last potty call, we were both facing west when a single, steady brilliant white light came over the ridge in front of us.  I would estimate it was no more than 1,000 feet above our heads since it just cleared the ridgetop.  There was no sound, it wasn't going super fast, it came directly toward us easterly, and when it got just past my head it simply blinked out like a light and was gone. I tried desperately to see the structure of a craft, but the white light was so intense, it was like trying to look at the sun and I could only take blinking glances.  I was unable to see any shape behind the light at all. We got the impression that once it saw us, it just poofed and was gone.  All of this was in a span of about 3 or 4 seconds. I estimated that the craft/light was abut 20 feet in diameter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Single steady white light cruising, then tears out into space having an orange glow behind it.;2010-04-18 20:00:00;5 seconds;Single steady white light cruising, then tears out into space having an orange glow behind it. In April of 2010, my friend and I just got back into Missoula from a day trip to the Flathead.  When I stopped at her home on the western part of town, it was full dark at 8:00 p.m. and we were standing outside of the car facing south.  She pointed over Lolo Peak and asked what that moving light was. When I looked, there was a steady white light moving somewhat slowly in a northeasterly direction toward town.  My impression was that it was quite high up, maybe around 30,000 feet where the commercial airliners cruise. In an instant it sped up to an incredible speed, made a huge arc to the southeast over Mitten Mountain, and tore out into space.  It emitted an orange glow behind it and just disappeared.

5 or 6 orange lights, no noise, disbursed and went in different directions.  lasted approx 40 seconds;2011-11-26 18:30:00;40 seconds;5 or 6 orange lights, no noise, disbursed and went in different directions.  lasted approx 40 seconds OK, so here are the details - and don't call me crazy!!! About 6:30 last night I was heading up the Rattlesnake valley when I saw a group (5 or 6) of orange lights traveling toward me. The were not aircraft or the beacons on top of the mountain.   There was no noise whatsoever (I rolled down my window) and they were too low to the ground.  Everyone in front and behind me pulled over to look at them.  When they got right in front of me, they disbursed and went different directions.  10 seconds later, before they were out of view, they faded and disappeared. This was at the top of Greenough hill but before Lolo St.  Completely round lights.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
3 am, Missoula, MT. 2 whitish lights blinked on & off as if they were communicating then gone. 10 seconds time period.;2020-05-15 03:00:00;6 seconds;3 am, Missoula, MT. 2 whitish lights blinked on & off as if they were communicating then gone. 10 seconds time period. I have a hard time sleeping at night because Life took away my parents & boyfriend within the last 3 years. The morning of May 15, 2020 I went out to stargaze & think. It was around 3 am. I do know what satellites & planes look like in the night sky. I was looking at about 55° above southern horizon. I suddenly saw a whitish light, at a 1 o'clock position, flash on & off. Then another whitish light, at an 11 o'clock position, flashed on & off. The light at 1 o'clock did the same again. Then they were gone. It was as if they were communicating to each other. There were no clouds last night because it was 32°! I may go out again tonight.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
