White disk flying over Montana;2006-08-06 16:00:00;45 seconds;White disk flying over Montana My mom, daughter, and I were driving through Missoula, MT when we saw a white, non-reflective disk in the sky travelling Northward from the South. It was maybe 200 feet in the air at the most, moving slower than an airplane but faster than a blimp. We watched it dip down below the treeline in a valley approx. a mile away. During this time   I also saw a woman and boy in a car behind us pointing toward the treeline where the craft had gone.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Blinking saucer.;2015-09-24 13:00:00;20 minutes;Blinking Saucer I noticed the object in the sky (over the Adams Center) moving very slowly.  The object would blink a bright white light every two seconds.  At first I thought it might be a balloon (Homecoming is this week) but the object would sometimes remain stationary for periods of time.  Obviously not a plane or helicopter.  I have video of it.  Looks like a saucer.  Perfectly round circle that lite up.  It stayed above the Adams Center/M Mountain for about 10 minutes and then slowly traveled west while increasing altitude and blinking the entire time.  The video is pretty dang cool!   I stopped watching after about 20 minutes due to people looking at me weird for videotaping the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
