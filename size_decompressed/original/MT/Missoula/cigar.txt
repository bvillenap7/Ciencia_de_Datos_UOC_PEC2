They moved slowly for about a minute, then returned behind the mountain and were not seen again. Objects were thin, and each one was about the size of two helicopters. They moved up and down more quickly than they did from side to side, and one was seen only for about 25 seconds. The other lingered for a minute or two more and emitted a few (2) flashes of light before returning behind the mountain.  I did not hear any engine sounds at all, even though I was in the open air (not in a car) and less than 2 miles away.  I could not determine color, except that it seemed a darker shade.  I myself am 34 years old, a professional working in the computer/transportation industry, and have not seen anything like this before.  I did not feel threatened at any time.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
