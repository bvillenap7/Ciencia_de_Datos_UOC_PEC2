Third sighting in 2 weeks, bright glowing solid white/yellow orb over Montana  definitely not a star or planet moving slowly;2009-06-30 02:30:00;hours;Third sighting in 2 weeks, bright glowing solid white/yellow orb over Montana  definitely not a star or planet moving slowly Third sighting in 2 weeks.  Brightest star-like object in the sky.  Very bright solid (not flickering) orb.  Slowly moving higher above the valley.  There was only one tonight.  When you look at it through a telescope or binoculars it is very obvious that it's not a star but a glowing orb.  They come and go.  Never here all the time.  Definitely not a planet.  I wish I had a better telescope.  Digital cameras have a hard time capturing bright things at night. I can send you all the pictures I've taken although the quality is not great.  Tried all kinds of settings but my camera is just not sufficient.  Please let me know if your interested in them.  (I know my email address looks silly but its real.);46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Single ufo's spotted within 2 days of one another in Missoula Montana;2012-05-12 21:10:00;5 seconds;Single ufo's spotted within 2 days of one another in Missoula Montana About one hour and 50 minutes before sunset my girlfreind and I were walking home from a gas station at the intersection of 3rd street and russell and witnesses a circular disc in the sky at approximately 30-40 degrees over the horizen in the sky. It was clearly seen by both of us as a large white solid sphere a few miles away. It was larger than any airplane. The sphere appeared to want to be seen, as it was showing off, and then a few seconds later it accelerated at warp speed.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Spherical points of light disappearing at the same spot in the sky.;2013-12-31 00:00:00;10 minutes;Spherical points of light disappearing at the same spot in the sky. Beginning approximately 1015 pm until approximately 1030 pm we observed orange colored spheres rising from the SE quarter of the sky to nearly overhead at which point these individually rising points of light simply disappeared at the same location in the sky.  There were probably in excess of 10 of these items all orange in color except for the final one we observed, which was a ruby red in hue.  Perhaps these items were Chinese lanterns, perhaps not.  Their disappearance at the same spot in the sky seems inexplicable to me.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Powerful blue light flying around and changing color.;2014-01-07 21:40:00;30-45 seconds;Powerful blue light flying around and changing color. A giant blue light that moved back and forth in the sky, turned red, turned back to blue, then flew downwards behind a hill.  It was around/over the I-90 overpass by the airport.  When it flew downwards, it was in the opposite direction of the airport so I have no clue where it could have landed.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Golden Sphere with eye like feature. ((anonymous report));2018-06-27 01:30:00;1 hour;Golden Sphere with eye like feature A bright yellow/orange light was seen in the sky.  It appeared to be moving and changing in brightness.  Upon further speculation with binoculars the shape was spherical.  It appeared to have black holes that moved and changed, with golden yellow wisps surrounding the black holes.  The wisps could be described as similar to roots, branches, or veins surrounding the moving black holes.  A distinct eye looking feature.  Very prominent black pupil with a yellow iris.  This eye like feature moved around the sphere.  One was able to see it through the sphere and when it came around to the side that was better in view. The sphere was observed by two people for about an hour with binoculars.  Then the sphere shrunk in size and appeared no different than a star in the sky.  The sphere moved quickly in the sky.  It was observed moving through the sky at a fast pace, but not rapid. It was observed from a middle point of view in the sky moving right.  After about 15 minutes, it was in the far right of the view.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Almost 38 &quotsatellites&quot traveling in the same alignment.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-28 20:50:00;5–10 minutes;Almost 38 &quotsatellites&quot traveling in the same alignment. I took the little dog out for her last call for the evening and looked up at the sky. I saw what I thought was a satellite overhead, its trajectory from SW to NE at a steady “satellite-cruising” speed. It then occurred to me that it appeared to be about twice as big and twice as bright though, just a steady white light. Then I noticed that there was another right behind on the same alignment…then another, all spaced perfectly apart and at a good distance, maybe about ten seconds apart.  I counted about five, and the weird thing was that each one would pass the same point in the sky and flare to a brilliant white like Venus for no more than two seconds, and all the while cruising very “methodically” along.  I called my husband out to watch, and I got to nineteen, then about the next six broke ranks, one headed due east at the steady speed, one headed north, same speed, another was on the same trajectory only not in perfect alignment but paralleling. After that, more kept coming in the original trajectory, perfectly spaced apart and in perfect alignment, for a total of 38! We watched for about five to 10 minutes.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
