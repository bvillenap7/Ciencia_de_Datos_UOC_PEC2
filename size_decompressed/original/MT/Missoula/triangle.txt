Kaleidescope of colors under triangle shaped craft;1992-10-29 18:30:00;10 minutes;Kalidescope of colors under triangle shaped craft Specific Location:  Missoula, Montana,  Obrien Creek Road, approx. ¾ mile west of Big Flat Road on the west side of town. Weather :  Dark, overcast , wind from WNW approx. 25-30 with gusts  Temp:  35/40 degrees as best I remember.  Topography:  Narrow lightly populated canyon with a  two-lane dirt road serving residents.   High steep mountain on the southern side of the canyon, less steep on the north side.   Road to top of  ‘hill/mountain’ both sides  300 – 400 feet.  The road from Big Flat Road deadended some 2 plus miles more or less going west. Was restless that night, nothing on TV to gather my interest.  Took a walk to  clear  my mind. Walked off my property to O’Brien Creek Road and went east towards town.  I could see the lights of town as usual..   Traveled on foot, gravel road, little over quarter mile, then turned around to go home.   Wind was picking up, noticed the clouds were showing ‘star breaks’  where I could glimpse a few stars here and there. Got to the driveway to go up to my house and ‘felt’ strange for some reason.   Thought that is odd.  I looked west up Obrien Creek Road and the sky was pitch black, no star breaks.  Stood there maybe 30 seconds and all around me above, it suddenly went pitch black, like somebody turned out the lights. Turned and looked towards town,  could still see the lights of town reflecting off the clouds in that direction.  Looked up and I could barely detect that something was moving above me.  Rush of ‘what the hell’ of course. Then as I looked up I saw an oval shaped light in a kalidescope of colors moving slowly over me in an easterly direction.  Tried to process all this without much luck.  The colors were moving around inside the oval, not rapidly, not at a snails pace.  My term for it was ‘a normal pace’, don’t know for sure where that came from  In a few more seconds the colors were gone,  and I could see a huge black triangular object moving over me and toward the east.  The black on this object was blacker than the surrounding ambiance, therefore it did have shape and movement.  It was dead silent as it moved, and it covered more than the height of the canyon tops both north and south of me.  Distance from the north and south tops I estimate to be over ¼ mile. Then, it was gone. I stood there,  trying to sort it all out.  Ha. Walked up to my house, took off my jacket, and looked at my hands, they were beet red.  Went into the bathroom, and my face was beet red as well.  Both hands and feet were itching but I thought it was from the harsh wind. Something told me, take a shower, now.  So I did, a long one, lots of soap.  Then, I sat around and went to bed early . Next day, a couple of my co-workers asked me how I got a sunburn.  I mumbled and left it along. The next day the redness had faded a lot, and the next day it was gone.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Some of my friend and I were outside, smoking when something flew over us. It looked like an airplane at first, but it was to big, and ;1999-10-12 01:30:00;1 minute;Some of my friend and I were outside, smoking when something flew over us. It looked like an airplane at first, but it was to big, and had an unusual light pattern on the underside. The lights also moved in towards the center and back out to the edges, and from this we could tell that it was a triangle. I, alone, saw a second object the next night. It may have been the same one. It flew down the Clark fork river, right over the river, until it was out of sight. It had lights Along the edges, and a large light in the center. Possibly twice the size of bowing 727. It was an equilateral triangle. The lights were mostly white, with red ones amongst them in no disernable pattern. It was ALMOST totally silent, and not going very fast.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Reddish-Orange Object Above Blue Mountain - Missoula, Montana;2008-03-04 22:30:00;5 minutes;Reddish-Orange Object Above Blue Mountain - Missoula, Montana My partner initially saw the object from our South Hills home.  It was hovering above Blue Mountain, moving south.  We had total cloud cover that night, so no stars or planets were visible. The cloud cover also provided a good contrast making the object easier to see.  My partner saw a triangular shape with lights. His initial reaction was thinking it was an airplane on fire.  When I came out to look at it, it was a bright, reddish-orange, round object.   It didn’t move for a few minutes. When I tried to focus my binoculars on it, it retreated in reverse away from the earth into the cloud cover.  And it moved fast. This probably took about two seconds.  I contacted our weather service and our local newspaper.  I’m waiting to hear if there were other sightings.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222

I saw a strange object that was just hovering, appeared to be a plane but planes don't hover.;2010-11-19 21:00:00;5 minutes;I saw a strange object that was just hovering, appeared to be a plane but planes don't hover. I was on my way home from work and had just picked up dinner, I live near the new military place out past Muralt’s. I was driving on the old highway and noticed a really bright light. I was just passing the airport and assumed it was just an airplane getting ready to land. Something was different though, I see airplanes landing all the time since I live so close to the airport. This was really bright and wasn’t moving, and it was at a lower height than what airplanes usually fly. So I drive past crossroads and I see this huge craft. It wasn’t as big as an airplane but it was still a good size. It was right across the highway from Muralt’s where they’re currently doing construction so I thought maybe some people were working late and it was just an extra bright light to help them see. All I know is that it wasn’t making any noise which is peculiar, and if it was a plane it would have made SOME movement since the first second I saw it. Sometimes airplanes appear not to be moving, but I had first seen this bright light from the airport and it hadn’t moved at all in the next 4 minutes or so of me driving toward it. No one else seemed to notice or care. I was about to pull over but decided to go home and get my mom. She thought I was full of it and I’m not sure if she believes that stuff. But I got her to come with me, unwillingly of course, and we got back to the place where I had seen it and it wasn’t there. I thought that was weird since it was at a standstill for a whole 5 minutes or so. And who knows, it could have been there before I had seen it too. My mom kind of got quiet, I think she understood that something unusual was going on too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Rounded triangle craft slowly hovers 200 ft above home;2013-07-13 23:00:00;30 minutes;Rounded triangle craft slowly hovers 200 ft above home We were standing outside talking and I noticed behind the person I was talking to, something with a red blinking light coming into sight from very high in the south night sky.  The craft got lower and lower until it was in perfect view maybe 200 feet above our home. It was shaped like a triangle but it had mass and rounded features.  It had blue and white lights to the back of the craft.   It went very slowly over the house and continued its way across the town and up the west valley moving about the same speed and staying fairly close to the ground.   We were so stunned that we just stood grasping each other for a few minutes and then one ran inside for the others and we all stood and watched it until we could no longer see it.   We all agree it was NOT an airplane or helicopter.  The sound was something like a very high pitched but very very quiet jet plane.   First time we had all seen anything like this!;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
