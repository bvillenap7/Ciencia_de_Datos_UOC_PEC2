Double Chevron.  Red, green, white and orange lights, hovering and moving right and left.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2012-08-15 23:30:00;30 minutes;Double Chevron.  Red, green, white and orange lights, hovering and moving right and left. The object looked like a double chevron, with multi-colored lights...orange, red, white and green.  It hovered in one location.  It changed direction several times.  We saw the same thing the previous night in the North West side of Missoula just before sunset.   The night of this report it was due West, slightly after midnight. It was completely silent...no engine noises like from a helicopter or airplane.  Occasionally, smaller white lights would move away from it, other times toward it.   The previous night, it appeared to drop down out of sight, then back up, then vanished.  Sometimes it moved rapidly, other times it appeared to stand in one spot.   Sometimes the lights would almost fade out completely, other times it would glow brightly.   We watched it for at least 30 minutes, then gave up.  Checked on it several times and it had moved toward the North somewhat. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Boomerang shaped craft in Missoula.;2015-04-20 22:30:00;15 seconds;Boomerang shaped craft in Missoula I just saw a boomerang-shape craft fly over the center of Missoula, almost right over my house.  It could have been 25 ft to upwards of 60 ft wide.  It flew silently and slowly.  I watched it for about 15 seconds.  It came from the southwest and was heading toward the downtown area.  It looked black but had a grey tint and was hard to make out against the starlit sky.  I only noticed it because it blacked out a star I happened to be looking at.   It had no lights and was 150-200 ft in the sky.  The sky is clear and there is a very slight breeze from the east.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
