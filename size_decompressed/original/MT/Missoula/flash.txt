Green object flew across the night sky with green trail behind it;2012-10-03 11:30:00;3 seconds;Green object flew across the night sky with green trail behind it I am a student at the University of Montana and I was at the library late last night.  While walking out I was facing west and saw a green light shoot across the sky.   At first I thought it was a firework but it became obvious it was not due to the fact that it shot across the entire night sky.  The whole thing only last about 3 or 4 seconds but it had a green trail behind it.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
