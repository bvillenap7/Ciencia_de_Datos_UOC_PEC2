It was a bright yellowish orange in the middle and very faintly there were smaller blinking lights on the side, from my view from the ground it appeared blueish.  Then when I went under an over pass the object disappeared, and my friend also said it suddenly vanished.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Golden-white orb making arcing moves.;2015-04-06 22:15:00;3-5 minutes;Golden-white orb making arcing moves. Description: Golden to White orb that was brighter than any planet.  The object moved across the sky from west to east.  It seemed to be fairly low and was moving slowly.  There was no sound.   At first I thought it was a satellite, but it was too bright.  Then, the movement changed from a straight line to a series of arcing patterns.  The movement was almost fluttery.   After passing by us to the east, the object sped up and moved upwards and easterly into the atmosphere and out of sight very rapidly.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
