A bright white light like I've never seen before;2006-04-16 02:00:00;5 minutes;A bright white light like I've never seen before In April of 2006 in Missoula< Montana approximately 2am on the 16th, I saw a star moving around in the sky, then all of a sudden within a flash of a second it shot straight down and hovered above a mountain top for 5 seconds.  It looked like when the in Star Trek when the ship went into warp speed because it sort of a tail behind it. It was a super white light the UFO was emitting, in which I can only describe as a white colored light I never seen before. It was so bright but yet it did not hurt my eyes while I was looking at it.  Then all of a sudden it shot back into space in less than a second. Then I could see it moving around like I saw it doing before it shot to the mountain top. The UFO hovered in an area called Patee creek recreation area. In 2011, living in Waipahu, Hawaii (Oahu), we (my best friend) saw a very large aqua colored blimp-like shaped craft flying around the Ewa Beach & Waipahu area for 20 minutes or so.  It made no sound and the big thing that caught my attention was it was flying in restricted air space where all incoming jets fly to land at the Honolulu International Airport.  No one, including the military are not to fly in that airspace. One month later at the same place in Hawaii, my roommate and I seen three crafts flashing in all different colors, round shape, and again these flying objects where right in front of the flight path of incoming jet liners in a restricted air space.  They were moving around like someone would juggle 3 balls. After 5 minutes or so, they all disappeared into the water never to be seen again. I kept this to myself long enough and I thought reporting them to you would add more information for you.   I am a retired Chief Warrant Officer in the Navy (Seabees) so I can distinguish between what a plane and UFO are, and after what I’ve seen, I am now a full believer in other life outside our world..;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Bright white light moving steadily east and up, disappearing into space, over Missoula, MT.;2007-06-16 01:00:00;10 sec;Bright white light moving steadily east and up, disappearing into space, over Missoula, MT. Around 1 am MST, I saw a light moving due east. It was the brightest object in the sky, brighter than Venus or Mars, white, very high. Clearly some kind of flying craft. I could not determine a particular shape, other than it resembled very bright star. It did not shoot across the sky, or flare or flash. The speed was constant. There was no sound, and no blinking lights. I spotted it at once as I walked out my back door, facing south. It was moving steadily eastward and upward. It did not disappear over the horizon. It faded from view into the night sky at about 80 degrees SE (I think that is the correct measure). If one looked straight up, then south down to about 80 degrees, then west to about 40 degrees, that is where I first spotted it. I followed it east to about 80 degrees, and that is where it faded into the clear sky fairly rapidly. I would estimate the sighting lasted roughly ten seconds. I would like to know if anyone else saw this. Thank you.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222

However this time there is an identical light to the west, both are the same incandescent white color, and luminosity.

Bright white orb hovers for over 4 hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star.  PD));2009-06-25 10:00:00;4 hours;Bright white orb hovers for over 4 hours. Starting at about 10 o'clock at night I noticed an extremely bright orb in the sky to the south-west of the valley.   This object was brighter than any star I have ever seen, and it stood in a local position for what I witnessed to be at least 4 hours.   The light was a steady light, with no pulsations, no flickering at all. The orb was a solid white incandescent light, unlike the surrounding stars which seemed dull, as they flickered seemingly different colors, reds, blues, orange, or green.  I eventually went to bed late at around 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.   I cannot say for exactly how long this object was in the sky, nor did I see it leave its location.   But I do know that it was no longer in the sky the next night, or the 2nd night after the event.   This event happened in a clear sky, with no cloud cover, and a small crescent moon.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Two blinking objects flying slowly across sky.;2009-08-12 23:30:00;Less than five minutes.;Two blinking objects flying slowly across sky. My daughter and I were outside hoping to see the Perseid meteor shower.  Two objects flew east to west across the night sky.  They were flying very straight and in a sort of formation, one first and the second on on his left flank.  Flying lower than the normal cruising altitude of commercial aircraft, the lights were too big to be that high up, but not low enough to be coming in to land at the local airport.  They stayed the same distance apart the whole time we could see them.  They had one distinct bright white light and two other blinking lights, possibly red or orange. They were flying slow enough that we were able to watch them for a couple of minutes before they were out of site.  Absolutely no sound at all.  We live outside of town and it was very quiet.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Flashing green, red, blue, and white lights hovering above and scanning valleys north of Missoula. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2011-07-10 02:05:00;1- 1.5 hr;flashing green, red, blue, and white lights hovering above and scanning valleys north of Missoula. At approximately two AM on Sunday, July 10th, my girlfriend, another friend of mine, and me stepped out into the back yard to smoke a cigarette.  We were about halfway done smoking when I noticed what appeared to be police light on top of the hill north of our house.  When I pointed them out, my friend said there was no way for a cop car to get there and no reason at this hour. We all began to study the flashing lights more and saw that there was a green light as well as the red, white, and blue flashing lights that caught my attention.  We, soon after, saw that the object wasn’t on the hill but hovering slightly above it.  We stayed to watch it and it began to move northwest. The UFO seemed to be scanning the valleys north of Missoula.  A bright light periodically would sweep through the valley and as it moved farther away we could see the light beaming down from it.  Where we had originally spotted it, there seemed to be a disturbance in the air.  It was like a billowing cloud of smoke but it was translucent and had a shimmering effect to it.  When the UFO got far enough away, we could see at least one other object farther out to the north-east that appeared to be ascending and scanning the ground as well. At the base of the cloud we noticed three small, gentle lights: one red, one blue and one green creeping over the hill.  These lights seemed to hover above the hill and were obviously very active, moving about the hill quickly and erratically scanning in miniature like the UFO had been.  They stopped, sometimes, reconvening and resting. We did not see the figures except faintly in the light of the UFO scans.  They were brown looking in the dark and very, very tall.  The first glimpse my girlfriend caught of one it seemed to be doing flips, like a slinky would.  The figures were lanky, bony looking and gangling. It was when we noticed the figures descending the hill toward us that we went inside and tried to settle down. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
2nd UFO sighting in Missoula Mt. in the space of 2 days;2012-05-14 23:00:00;7 seconds;2nd UFO sighting in Missoula Mt. in the space of 2 days We were at the corner of 13th street and Catlin, in Missoula Mt. with a clear south sky behind us when Joe saw lights reflect off the outside window of the house we were at. He thought it was out of a Speilberg movie because it was so unusually bright while we were sitting in the backyard. It appeared as almost fireworks reflecting off the outside windows.  Joe's girlfreind Tiauna saw the object directly at about a 45 degree angle off the horizon as a big ball of light. It appeared as still light, not moving, Then it sped off to the right leaving a laser beam of light (tail) behind. There was no shape, just a ball of white illumination. Pure white, like she had never seen before. It was in your face, no more than 500 yards away and then it shot off over the trees and houses. No more than 7 seconds start to finish.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222

Chinese paper lanterns at  9pm or UFO's?;2013-12-27 21:00:00;5 minutes;Chinese paper lanterns at  9pm or UFO's? While driving up the Rattle snake we noticed a bright orange/yellowish light next to the mountain.  We thought wow, what vehicle is up there?  Was very bright considering other lights at the base of the hills going up the rattle snake. We continued to drive and my passengers watched this light stay stationary and then fly up the mountain a little bit.  By then we knew it was not a car.  It started to shift and then almost follow the mountain as we climbed up the rattle snake.  It then suddenly disappeared and we couldnt find it. I thought, lets turn around and go back.  We turned around and headed back down and saw another one very low.  This was was swaying around and climbed very steadily unlike an aircraft.  If I had to guess it was like it was a balloon getting pushed around by the wind.   But this climbed and climbed and then suddenly disappeared again, (the second one). These objects never darted off but appeared to just disappear.  It was also dark and we couldnt really get a relative idea on how far away it was. The only other thing this could have been was people lighting off the Chinese paper lanterns (the candles in a bag/hot air ballon principle) and letting them fly up in the mountains.  Only possible thing I could think of or something unidentified. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222

Different sized and colored orbs of light chasing into space.;2016-07-26 22:48:00;5 minutes;Different sized and colored orbs of light chasing into space. The two of us were hot tubbing on the patio.  We noticed a white light seamlessly gliding with no beacon light far in the distance, didn’t give it much notice.  It then disappeared over the horizon.   Next something extraordinary happened.  Two lights at faster than normal speed appeared coming back from where the first light disappeared.  One of the lights seemed to be chasing the other.  The light giving chase was bigger and brighter, the other seemed dimmer with a reddish tint appeared to be fleeing then made a maneuver straight up the lights became faint and seemed to disappear into space.  Roughly five minutes later in the same area where we saw the lights disappear there was a giant flash of white light.  It moved very little with two duller flashes and then it was gone.   I’m an avid star gazer blown away.  Never have seen anything like this, and doubt I ever will again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Higgens Street Bridge--steady fast, bright light, going from horizon to horizon;2016-09-15 22:15:00;6 seconds;Higgens Street Bridge - steady fast Bright light going from horizon to horizon. I saw the sharp point of light as it went north from a 1 to 3 o'clock position vanishing behind a tall building.  There were five other people on the Higgens Street bridge.  One gentleman had seen the light go from horizon to horizon. The light maintained its intensity throughout.  There was speculation it was an asteroid though it failed to behave like an asteroid.  It was a fast, fast, mechanized motion.  Also, comets tend to burn up and disintegrate.  If this was a satellite it was the brightest, fastest piece of space junk crashing to earth - which might be really dangerous for those on the ground!   We also considered the possibility of a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of this report, and she sounded to us to be eloquent and sober-minded.  We suspect that she probably is an excellent witness.

Then suddenly, a bright star looking object at a closer distance, in the opposite direction appeared to be getting bigger and was approaching us.   Immediately I started video-taping the object as it came right over head, hovering for a few seconds, then abruptly changed course.  It went past a star in the sky and then got smaller and smaller disappearing a few minutes later.  The object appeared to be changing in brightness and even color in a slight manner.  The object was much closer to us than the video made it seem, and it made no noise when it was overhead, which made me nervous.   This took place at the Beavertail Pond out-side of Missoula, Montana.   I am a law school student here in Montana and have never been into UFO's or much of a believer, but this incident has really shaken me up.
