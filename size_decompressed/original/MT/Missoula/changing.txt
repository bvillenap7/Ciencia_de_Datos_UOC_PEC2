Changing shapes and colors spotted over the the city of Missoula;2012-08-03 00:30:00;3-4 minutes;Changing shapes and colors spotted over the the city of Missoula While I was driving east on I90 my friend and car passenger saw a multicolored triangle shaped object over the city of Missoula, MT.  I was only able to glimpse while driving but I saw a rainbow colored jelly fish shaped object with the tentacles moving while the entire object was stationary in the sky. It seemed to change into something that looked a little like a boomerang with six big lights on each side.  My friend was able to see it change multiple times and he saw rainbow colors and the change into a boomerang shape as well.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Ten orange bottomed objects seemed to shape-shift, one blacked out its light as it swooped down over the city.;2015-04-24 21:04:00;4 minutes;Ten orange bottomed objects seemed to shape-shift, one blacked out its light as it swooped down over the city. I noticed three or four orange dots in the sky while driving west.  Something seemed out of the ordinary, so I pulled over into the first metered parking spot on the north side of the street. I sat in the car just watching to see if the objects had blinking lights.  I saw orange lights pulsating very slightly, but no other lights.  I called my wife to see if she could spot them, she and the neighbors were able to see them (the neighbor’s friend took out his phone). That is when I noticed a few more objects coming over the mountain range in the direction of the sunset (which had set about 30 minutes beforehand). I hopped out of the car and crossed the road to the south sidewalk on the street.  I tried to call my friend who drives taxi and always has a camera on him, he didn't answer.  I could see the silhouette of a couple of the objects, they looked like monolithic type pillars (square four sided rectangles pointing straight up and down lengthwise). At this point I noticed the orange lights where on the bottom of the objects.  They seemed to all go different directions, with two sets of two going in the same directions (north and south).  One kept a west to east direction and got fairly close to my location.  The orange glow was in a ring shape on the bottom of the object. The object still traveling west to east shut off its single orange “light” as it moved over the city.  I could make it out in the still slightly lit sky.  The object looked like a pyramid spinning, almost slowly.  It slowed and lowered in altitude.  It seemed to be within a mile of me and larger than a large size van. When it was due south of me, the object had leveled out and begun to fly over just south of the downtown area.  The object rose slightly and sped up as it started to gain altitude.  I then lost track of it behind trees and houses.  I looked to see if any of the other objects were still visible.  They were not.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222

It changed to a horizontal line, flashing red and green lights at either end, and then back to vertical, with the same red and green lights at either end.   I am a frequent looker at the night sky, as I work the night shift.  This wa something that I have not seen before.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
Amber triangles over Missoula, MT;2020-03-16 03:42:00;45 seconds;Amber triangles over Missoula, MT The light appeared and looked like smoke floating in the sky and I sat there watching it.  It then formed into a dim light and floated across the sky and burst into about six different lights.  As my boyfriend and I watched the lights formed two triangles each made from three lights and moved across the sky and faded out.  The colors changed also, the first color was grey almost smoke like.  Then from there a white light. At the end when it burst into the lights and triangles it turned an amber almost orange looking color.  It’s definitely nothing like we’ve ever seen before and we practice CE-5 meditation.  It also didn’t look like anything the military could have because all of this happened within seconds.;46.8754340000001;-114.033902222222
