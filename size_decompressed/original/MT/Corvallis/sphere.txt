Metal sphere;2011-09-03 22:00:00;not applicable;Metal sphere I thought I noticed a star in a location I was not accustomed to seeing one in, so took a couple photos in succesion of it. Downloaded them to my computer the next morning and this is what I came out.   The second photo is the best, but if you zoom in on the other two it appears that it is the same object.;46.3179;-114.1059
