Seven pulsating red lights unlike any regular aircraft moving at low altitude, very slowly, headed N/NE at 00:30-Corvallis, MT;2016-06-28 00:24:00;~5 minutes;Seven pulsating red lights unlike any regular aircraft moving at low altitude, very slowly, headed N/NE at 00:30-Corvallis, MT. This is the 2nd time I have seen the seven red blinking lights moving slowly across the night sky near my home, headed N/NE.  A couple days ago, I viewed them from my house deck and they looked like they were closer to the Bitterroot Mtns.  I did not call anyone that day, but Googled several search words attempting to determine if this was some kind of pre-planned ferry flight, or group of aircraft responding to a forest fire.  This time, they flew close together, lower than they appeared to be the other night, but both times, were at a low altitude, and moved very very slowly.   Tonight, I was driving home when I spotted them at 00:24, and called my daughter right away.  She is a degreed aviation management professional who is a Montana licensed fixed wing and helicopter pilot who makes her living flying professionally.  She walked out to her driveway and viewed them at the same time.  She was looking north/northeast.  I was traveling almost due east in my car, looking north/northeast, then what seemed to be more north.  They did not look like aircraft typically seen.  We live withing 10 miles of the Hamilton, MT, airport.  She too, believes they were something other than regular aircraft of any kind.  The objects made absolutely no sound.  There appeared to be a different (typical) aircraft above the 7, higher in the sky, traveling W/NW.  The 7 red pulsing lights moved much more slowly than even a helicopter would.
