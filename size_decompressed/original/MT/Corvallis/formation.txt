Could not sleep.  My bedroom faces due East the Sapphire Mountains to be specific. I noticed what appeared to be a quickly moving cluster of a few (maybe 3?), very deep red dots.  No white lights and a shade of red that clearly was not airliner or port red. It/they moved towards the Northwest above the mountains.  Quite possible that this/these objects were higher in the sky than my eye and brain could register.   Horizontal movement in a straight line only.;46.3179;-114.1059
