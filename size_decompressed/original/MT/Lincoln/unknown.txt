Unknown lights and unexplained observation on Lewis and Clark Pass, MT 11 July 2007;2007-07-11 23:30:00;25 Minutes;Unknown lights and unexplained observation on Lewis and Clark Pass, MT 11 July 2007 At approximately 23:30 July 11, two of us continental divide hikers were preparing dinner at Lewis and Clark Pass which is about 20 miles East of Lincoln, MT.  At some point we realized we were under observation by two set of light reflective eyes which refused to move despite our attempts to scare them away.   Initially we believed them to be moose or bear, but we were unable to discern the shape of their bodies, and they were soon joined by two more observers.   This had been quite an unsettling experience, however, we are each educated and not one a believer in, I guess others.   However, shortly the aura borealis spanned the northern sky in a manner I have not seen since childhood (can someone confirm this? and is there any association?) and there was an amber light at an in determinant distance which was impossibly of terrestrial origin.   Almost immediately, it was joined by a second and the lights commenced in a searching pattern.   We were quite alone and very concerned for our safety.  We immediately stopped all our light and attempted to calm one of our party members, since it seemed that it would be impossible to escape the searching lights.   We checked each of the party the next day to insure there were no marks that hadn't been previously.  I can't say any of us believe in UFOs, but really we just want to know if any one else experienced or saw anything strange on July 11th around Rogers Pass, MT.;46.9575;-112.6651
