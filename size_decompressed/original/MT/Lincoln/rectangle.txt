Rectangle Hovering Craft Over Lincoln, MT;2021-07-04 22:00:00;15 minutes;Rectangle Hovering Craft Over Lincoln, MT Lincoln, MT JULY 4th, 2021. I observed a rectangle shaped formation of red flashing lights, believed to be a single craft streak across the night sky approx. 15000 above the town of Lincoln Montana.  The craft quickly moved across the sky and then slowed and hovered for 5 minutes, quickly moved forward and back and hovered again. This took place as the nightly fireworks show took place. The observation took place between 10 and 11 pm.;46.9575;-112.6651
