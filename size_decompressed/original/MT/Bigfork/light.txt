It looked like pictures of comets I have seen. The head of the light was large in the sky, comparing it with stars that night. The light seemed to appear out of nowhere and fell down in a 90 degree arc into the mountains, or east of the mountains(Swan Mountains, just sounth of the Flathead, Lake county borders.) Two of us saw it and were in complete awe. I expected there to be a jolt when it hit(if it hit ground) but, there was no jolt. One observer works in the conservation field and the other is currently a stay at home mom. We talked to people the next day to see if they had seen what we had seen but, so far, nobody had, and looked in the paper and heard the news and there was no mention of a comet, meteor etc., unless we missed it. It was not northern lights I have seen that.;48.0619;-114.0769
3 different colored objects moving down towards me.;2005-10-08 20:30:00;2 minutes;3 different colored objects moving down towards me. I was walking along the road (hwy.35) in Bigfork when I looked up I saw a bright reddish light hovering above me.  As I stood there in complete amazment it suddenly disapeared and another one just like it appeared directly under its location, however this new one had a yellowish hue to it.  Just when I thought I had seen it all, it too disappeared and was soon replaced with a very distinct green roundish shape.  By this time I was totally freaked out and ran as fast as I could, to get away from it as it seemed to be moving in a downward direction to me!
