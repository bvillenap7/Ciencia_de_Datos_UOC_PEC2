Bright light above Florence, Mt.;2012-02-08 19:00:00;10 min.;Bright light above Florence, Mt. I went out to feed my dogs about 7:30 PM and a very bright star caught my attention.  It was to the West and a little South.  As I watched it it dimmed to a regular looking star and then got bright again.  There was clouds moving through but this was bright enough to shine through the clouds.  It was very unusal and something I'd never seen befor.  It did not appear to be moving and maybe it was just a planet ??  Wondering if there were others who saw it also ?;46.6324;-114.095
