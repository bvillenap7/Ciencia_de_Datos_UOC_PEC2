I'm an artist, critical of the visual height, color, etc;2012-07-15 15:00:00;1 minutes;I'm an artist, critical of the visual height, color, etc Incident 1.  3pm in afternoon, sunny clear day, going up a road and I saw a 60 foot round shadow coming down the road and following the curve.  I watched it coming towards me.  The shadow was wider than the 60 ft road and came up over my car.  I jumped out to see where it went - nothing..it disappeared. Incident 2.  10pm in night, with husband, driving on same road, I saw a huge spotlight beaming down the mountain with nothing above it, no noise. Incident 3.   9pm nighttime, I saw a bright florescent orange right triangle (the length of 4 cars) glide horizontally at a slow speed from east to west, not dropping in elevation. 4,100 ft altitude.  There were no lights on it.  No sound.  I had to watch where I was going because of a cliff, so I didn't see where it went.  I'll be ready next time.

Green and red light Bitterroot Valley, MT;2017-07-11 00:20:00;60 seconds;Green and red light Bitterroot Valley, MT. I was getting ready for bed and noticed that the sky seemed quite bright, so I looked out the window and saw lights I thought was an airplane, at first, but it wasn't moving, so I grabbed my binoculars and it looked like a triangle with a green light on each side and in the middle a red light.   My mom was in the other room so when I yelled for her it's like it heard me because it took off behind the trees but then I saw it go down.  It literally went from going straight to lowering down behind the trees which was probably around 50 feet in front of me.   And earlier that day I saw a black helicopter fly overhead, which I also saw one a month prior too!   And then on the 6th of this month was a very rare earthquake that happened after midnight, as well.;46.6324;-114.095
