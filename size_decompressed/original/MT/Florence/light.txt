3 bright lights moving erratically in Florence, MT.;1999-09-10 02:00:00;30 minutes;3 bright lights moving erratically in Florence, MT. One night 4 of us were out on my deck in Florence,MT. My deck faced to the east towards the river. We all of a sudden saw 1 bright light hovering over the tree line. The light would fade in and out. It would go from bright to dim.  Then two more lights showed up fading in an out.  One light was stationary but it was moving erratically back and forth but still stationary.  The other 2 lights were just shooting around at crazy angles down the bitterroot valley southeast of my house.  Nothing an aircraft could do!  The light would be stationary then all of a sudden they shot down the valley.  I mean probably 50-60 miles in the matter of 2 seconds.  Then they would shoot back to the one that was stationary behind my house.  They were not high in the sky.  This went on for about 30 minutes.  We were just all stunned.  We called the airport in Missoula to see if they saw anything on their radar but we didn't get through. I have goosebumps writing this!  Oh and no noise at all ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Dual lights traveling together in irregular pattern;2009-08-20 22:00:00;10 mins;Dual lights traveling together in irregular pattern looking into the Milky Way we noticed 2 lights with space between them but seemed to be fixed together(possibly a football field apart).  we noticed it moving relatively slowly(small airplane speed and about the same hieght as a small airplane would travel) and it turned toward us (we could see the lights brighten).   Moving at the same pace it turned away and then looked to travel upward(as the lights got closer together and dimmer).   It kept traveling into the milky way until we couldn't see it anymore.  We never heard sound at any time.  The lights were white (like headlights of a car) and did not change color.;46.6324;-114.095
3 pulsating red lights crossing the valley.;2013-05-14 21:30:00;5 minutes;3 pulsating red lights crossing the valley. My girlfriend & I were driving back home from dinner and seen 3 lights in the sky. I was driving and could not keep my eyes off of them because they were so strange.   At first I just seen one and figured it was a plane, but I then noticed two other lights.  They were red and pulsing.  The formation was a straight line evenly spaced, heading east.   Eventually one was closer to the other.  I was not directly under the lights but if I had to guess it looked like it might of been a triangle from underneath.   I watched them move slowly over the hills to the east.  I'm certain it wasn't an airplane, the lights were way too far apart.  And I don't think there would be 3 airplanes following one another.  I'm certain it was a UFO, all one craft. It took probably a few minutes for it to pass the valley. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

It had followed us for 40 mins. We were on a drive from missoula mt to florence mt. It was slightly dark our so it looked like a light.;2020-03-15 19:00:00;40 minutes;It had followed us for 40 mins. We were on a drive from missoula mt to florence mt. It was slightly dark our so it looked like a light. It followed us till we got home. Right when we got home it blinked twice and completely vanished right in front of our eyes. Im terrified because it knows where we live now. It was about as. It was about as high as a plane would fly  .there was only one object.  It would get dim and then with in a second it would be super bright again.;46.6324;-114.095
