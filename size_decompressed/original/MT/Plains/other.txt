Vanished after I came closer to it. While walking home at night the sky was very clear due to the cold weather.  The night sky was inky purple.  I observed a boomerang shaped object the perimeter of which was dotted with green lights.  My hometown was very small and quiet.  I heard no noise whatsoever.  I continued to observe the object and found myself actually running towards it to get a better look.   Once I was out from underneath the street light I was in a position to see it better I held my breath so the water vapor would not obstruct my view.  The object remained totally motionless.  I estimate it was 500 to 1,000 feet from the ground.  I watched it for about a minute and the green marker lights on the outer edges went out starting with the lead light than the #1 port side, #2, #3 etc... until the last light on the starboard site turned off and the object was gone.   This was the one and only unexplainable thing I've seen first hand. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));47.4705;-114.8949
