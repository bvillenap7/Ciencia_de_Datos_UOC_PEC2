I was walking outside in Eastern Montana and observed a sphere.  It was 10 degrees off the horizon in the southeast.  The twinkling caught my attention right away. It also traveled left to right and also up and down.  The dominate colors were green, blue, red, and white.  Even as we write it is quite beautiful and awesome!;46.829;-105.3706
