Large black triangle with dull orange lights.;2015-10-08 22:00:00;30 seconds;Large black triangle with dull orange lights. Was sitting on the front porch when I noticed an object moving slowly moving from the southeast going northwest.  At first thought it was a plane but as it came closer noticed it didnâ€™t look like a plan at all but a large black triangle.  The object flew almost directly above my house.There were dull orange lights surrounding its perimeter, one blue, no blinking lights.  It made a low hum but no other noises.  Probably about 500-1000 ft above, it was hard to tell.  The object appeared to be very large, but again hard to judge.  The craft was dark, blotting out the stars.  The time was 10pm almost exactly.  The whole experience lasted about 30 seconds;46.7671;-113.704
