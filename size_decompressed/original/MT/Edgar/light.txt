Small point of light that accelerated at incredible speed;2020-04-17 21:07:00;1 minute;Small point of light that accelerated at incredible speed I was looking up by big dipper and saw a flash of light. Kept watching and saw a small point of light that was moving around irregularly Thought maybe it was just me so I got close to roof line so I had a reference. Was definitely moving around. Then it stopped for a second and shot off at incredible speed. Moved 15 to 20 degrees in less than a second.;45.462;-108.8481
