Orange flame colored comet-like object travelling North to South over Manhattan, Montana.  Silent.;2007-01-04 06:14:00;15 seconds;Orange flame colored comet-like object travelling North to South over Manhattan, Montana.  Silent. Object was not a fireball I know how those behave and have seen several.   Object appeared directly in front of my vehicle overhead.  Near enough to make me think it might be an aircraft on approach to Gallatin field, however, it was a uniform orange flame color-with a long-perhaps eight times the size of the object-tail, also flame color and fading out, such as one might imagine a comet to look like.  It was close, traveling very slowly-I thought, too slow for a fixed wing aircraft-about as fast as a helicopter on approach.   Stopped the vehicle and raised my cell phone to get a picture, had it in the viewfinder, and it disappeared.  There are a lot of aircraft in the sky here because of the nearness of the airfield,we are used to them.  This thing made no sound.   The tail faded strangely-as an object on your desktop pc might fade out if you chose that option in Windows XP.;45.7956;-111.3162
