My eight year old son saw something out the passenger-side window of our car.  He asked me what that white thing was in the sky.  I couldn't see it from my angle, so I pulled over and stopped the car.  We watched an oval shaped white object moving accross the blue sky, going east from Libby.  There were no clouds and it was before we had any smoke from the fires.  We looked down for just a couple seconds to get my binoculars, and when we looked back up all we could see was blue sky.  It had disappeared!;48.3789;-115.5415
