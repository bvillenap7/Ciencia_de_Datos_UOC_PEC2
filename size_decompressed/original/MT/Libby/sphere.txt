A silver, metallic orb was suspended about 3 stories across the street from our house.  There were bright red, green, yellow blinking and rotating lights around the bottom of the orb.  We got out of our car and walked across the street to look at the orb, trying to identify if we thought it was a drone or some kind of satellite.  The object was hovering initially and then, without a sound, and very quickly began to move upward into the atmosphere and eventually appeared as if it had “star like” qualities, and then disappeared UP into space.;48.3789;-115.5415
