Bright red flashing light hovering seen by a rancher and wife in SE Sweet grass county, MT;2019-12-17 21:00:00;5 minutes;Bright red flashing light hovering seen by a rancher and wife in SE Sweet grass county, MT My husband and I were coming home and saw a steady flashing red light that seemed to be moving extremely slow if at all above our ranch heading south.  We stopped to put our field glasses on it but it disappeared quickly.  Then out of nowhere it appeared again this time above our main courtyard of the ranch circling and blinking a very bright red flashing light.  Then it started to head due East.  This time we both got out of the pickup to listening for any sort of noise but there was none.  Then just like the first time we seen it, it disappeared.;45.7448;-109.5169
