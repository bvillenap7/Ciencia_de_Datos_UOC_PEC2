I'd gone into the tent (an open-air tent, the kind where you can see out perfectly clear).  I'd closed my eyes for a few seconds, and through the skin of my closed eyes I could see this brightness.  I opened my eyes and saw this bright white light.  It was like a helicopter spotlight or a flare, but utterly soundless, falling slowly out of the sky until it winked out and then turned into an orange pinpoint of light and unnaturally sped at a 90 degree angle to the right.  Then it completely vanished.;46.9438;-108.3184
