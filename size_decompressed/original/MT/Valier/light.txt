The lights seemed to all be centered in one place.  I thought they were only stars, that is until they broke from the group and went of north, west, and east.  In a mere matter of minutes they were out of sight.  The lights would blink very rapidly, but i was unable to time the gap between flashes.;48.2794;-112.3042
