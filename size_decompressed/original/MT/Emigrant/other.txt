I would not have called it a sighting because it was so startling.  It was only after I related what I saw to my husband that I realized it was without doubt a UFO.  My husband was extremely tired that evening and had gone to bed before me.  So when I saw the sight, I didn’t wake him (and I’m kicking myself for not doing that) because he was so tired.  I saw up on a hill near the back of our home a flaming dome.  When I say flaming I mean this literally.  It appeared to be burning.  I could see the fires within it churning and burning.  It was vidid.  It had an aura.  Oddly the aura appeared to be something artificial because it did not appear ethereal.  It looked somehow like a designed aura.  It was sort of like scallops with a black edge.  But it was light.  I was dumbfounded.  I had an preconceived idea of what UFOs look like.  This fit nothing I’d ever heard of.  I decided to get a flashlight and go outside to see if lI could see it better.  But it was early in the morning and we have wild animals out here and I decided it would not be wise to do this.  By the time I got the flashlight and returned to the window, it had diminished.  I would say I was away maybe 6 minutes.  Then as I stood and watched, the dome simply gradually  diminished in brightness and somewhat rapidly vanished (as if disappearing into the hill).  It just collapsed  right before my eyes.  And it was just gone.  When I told my husband about it the next morning, he said it was probably a UFO.;45.2677;-110.7895
