String of Attached Lights with No Sound Moving Towards Us;2021-05-15 23:37:00;20 minutes;String of Attached Lights with No Sound Moving Towards Us On May 15, 2021 at approximately 11:30 PM, my partner and I were sitting on a rooftop looking at the stars at a home outside Emigrant, Montana. There were no clouds and we could see the stars.  At approximately 11:37 PM, we noticed an object coming across the sky from the southwestern sky (near Yellowstone National Park). The object was a straight line of attached lights and it was moving in our direction. The flying object looked to be made up of over 40 white lights and appeared to be about a mile long. As it came towards our direction, I took a photograph on my Iphone. The object appeared to stall as it moved closer and the lights could not be seen as well. It appeared to remain in this location, about 10-15 miles away from where we sat, for approximately 1-2 minutes. At this point, I called a family member because I was scared and then the object started to move again towards the northwestern portion of the sky. As the flying object started moving toward! s the northeastern sky, the lights were still visible at the bottom, but there also was a shadow that was not lit up that was visible.  It appeared as if the object had multiple sides and not just the bottom lights. The object made no sound and there was no sound of nightlife at that moment. (There was an owl hooting before the object appeared and stopped during the event.) Prior to this event, my dog did not want to go outside to use the restroom and was anxious when we went out on the roof to look at the stars, which was not normal behavior for my dog.;45.2677;-110.7895
