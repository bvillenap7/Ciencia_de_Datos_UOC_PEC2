Three large circular crafts moving towards Missoula.;2010-03-10 00:23:00;Several Minutes;Three large circular crafts moving towards Missoula. I was travelling along I-90 from Missoula towards Huson very early in the morning after leaving work.  I saw in the sky an extremely large round craft with lights protruding out from the sides.  The lights were yellow, red, and blue.  It was very low, maybe about three tree lenghts high. And it made no sound.  It was moving towards Missoula and I passed underneath it.  There were two other same shaped crafts behind it higher up in the sky.  When I got off the exit at Huson, I spotted another one that looked like the others.;47.0666;-114.423
