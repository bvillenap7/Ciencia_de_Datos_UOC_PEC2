Orange light flickering and floating in a the sky;2019-04-06 23:15:00;5 minutes;Orange light flickering and floating in a the sky I am a housewife and my husband is a small business owner. I had taken a shower and was headed to the bedroom.  We have large, vaulted, triangular windows.  A light out one window caught my eye. Very far up, above cruising altitude for a plane, was an orange light.  It flickered continuously and floated in the sky like you would picture a ping pong ball floating on water.  It went up a little and down a little but stayed in the same general area.  I stood frozen for approximately three minutes and it continued floating and flickering.  It looked very much like a giant ember from a fire floating up into the sky. I finally texted my husband.  He rushed out without his glasses and saw the light.  He went outside onto the porch.  With his eyes being blurry he said the object looked triangular.   He raced in to get his glasses, and I continued to watch the light flicker and float.  He put his glasses on and the light became fainter each time it flickered.  After about the third flicker the light disappeared.
