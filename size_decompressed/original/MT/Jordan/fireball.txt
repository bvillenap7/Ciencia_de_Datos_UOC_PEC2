Off to the East, I saw what I can only describe as a comet, or what I think one would look like.  It was a bright green bright ball with light trailing behind it, tails?   And it fell off into the dark sky and disappeared.   The entire experience was less than a minute, feels considerably longer because of how detailed I remember the experience being and all the thoughts I had in the few seconds trying to rationalize what I saw;47.3171;-106.9124
