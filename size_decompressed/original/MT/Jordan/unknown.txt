Dimming, off, bright again to far at distance Driving westboubd between Jordan Mt and Lewiston Mt, on MT200 for two hours we saw lights too close flying too low. In that area theres no major arports or too many towers with light.  Clear sky.  For the first hour the light flying too close right side of us I could say between 1 or 2 miles.  Later, the lights start dimming and then off, bright dimming and off.  We stop at the rest area and the lights gain speed towards the horizont/sky.  One kept straight and the otherone went  to the right.  Never saw something like this before.  Cant tell shape or size.  Just too brig.ht and too low compare with the stars.;47.3171;-106.9124
