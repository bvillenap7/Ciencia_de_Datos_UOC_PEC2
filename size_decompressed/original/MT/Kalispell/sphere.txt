Red Orb flew over our vehicle;2003-11-12 23:00:00;10 seconds;Red Orb flew over our vehicle In Early November of 2003 my friend and I were driving home down Foys Lake highway headed back toward town passing Lone Pine state Park.  We both witnessed a orange/pinkish red colored sphere/orb slowly fly over the roadway above my vehicle and continued north over lone pine state park. It accurately moneuvered ten to 15 feet above the tree line as it fly up and over the mountains. We watched it fly out of vision toward flathead lake.  One of the craziest things I have ever seen. We got a real good look at it up close when it flew over the car. It was probably 5 feet in diameter and seemed semi transparent.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959

Witnessed 5 orange, sphere orbs flying South to East through the night sky.;2016-04-01 20:45:00;10 minutes;Witnessed 5 orange, sphere orbs flying South to East through the night sky. We watched 5 orange, sphere orbs come from the South West and travel towards the East.    There were 2 groups.  The first with 4 orbs, the second with 1.  They seemed to reach a certain spot in the sky, then disappear.   They were moving a bit slower than an airplane might move.  One orb seemed to quit moving for a second or two.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
3 orange/fluorescent orange orbs both stationary and moving sighted for about 5 minutes.;2016-12-24 22:10:00;5 minutes;3 orange/fluorescent orange orbs both stationary and moving sighted for about 5 minutes. While taking out my garbage at 10:10pm, I noticed a truck pull into a parking lot next to me a gentleman exit his vehicle and shouted and pointed for me to look up and see a light he was observing.  it was snowing lightly and the cloud deck was low enough over kalispell that the city lights were causing the cloud deck to be slightly illuminated. what i saw was a very bright single orange orb moving slowly from the east to the west.   after about 60 seconds it appeared to fade out.  then i noticed another orb appear behind it moving in the same direction. it became very bright and after another 60 seconds it became stationary.  it then appeared to either fade or maybe gain altitude and fade after another 60 seconds.   i then observed another orb in the eastern sky moving south. it became very bright and then faded after about 45 seconds. the whole incident took 4-5 minutes.  the man who was watching these with me said he had been watching them for about 5 minutes before pulling over and parking. he did film them towards the end with his phone camera.   i know it's christmas eve but i don't think it was santa's sleigh.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
