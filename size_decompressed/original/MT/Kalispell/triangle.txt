Triangle Craft  ((NUFORC Note:  NOSS satellite formation??  PD));2004-09-04 00:00:00;2 Minutes;Triangle Craft A bunch of friends and myself went out camping on McGregor Lake, to get away from the city and enjoy the beautiful weather.  Right when we all laid-down underneith the stars, we started looking for falling stars and satilites.  Immediatly I saw a 3 point formation (triangle of lights, star size) move across the sky.  They were a bit larger than satilites, and didnt break from their triangle formation.  The craft made no noise, and flew from West to East.  Later on about 10 minutes later, the same craft or another of the same style flew over head, going south to north. About a month later I saw the same craft, but at 8pm.  I was in town and in my car at an intersection.  The craft flew over head from the north turned and headed east, away from my car.  The craft, unlike the previous two, had beams of light connecting the points of light on each corner of the triangle.  Like the craft had side doors along the length of each side and they opened, and a soft peach colored light glowed off the sides, then the stopped, then did it again. I just talked to a friend of mine who saw the 2 craft during our camping trip, and he saw 2 more just this last week (september 9th, 04) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a time for the event.  We suspect the witnesses may have observed the three satellites, which fly in formation, and which we believe are part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite program.

Two objects seen flying, stopping, and then dissipating.;2008-04-19 01:20:00;20 minutes;Two objects seen flying, stopping, and then dissipating. The first object was a triangular shaped craft. I would say it was at least three football fields wide and about a quarter of that long. There were five giant lights spaced at regular intervals from tip to tip (width) on the craft. The craft seemed to vibrant and hum as it passed overhead. It traveled fairly fast. It got to about 4 miles away and then it abruptly stopped* and then disappeared over a period of about 5 seconds. The spot where it was just looked many stars bunched together that are no longer there when you look at that general area.  *With how big the object was and how fast it was traveling, it should not have been able to stop that fast and thatâ€™s what made me first think that humans could not have made this.  The second craft appeared about 3 minutes after the first craft disappeared. It flew from the southeast and was descending. I would estimate the craft was about as wide as the wingspan of a commercial jet and about as long two football fields. It had a cylindrical fuselage. It had one green light near the front and two purple lights at the rear. The front sloped down from the main body of the craft and was lower than the rest of the craft as well. I heard no noise from the craft. It also stopped very quickly and disappeared. Just like the previous craft, the place where the craft stopped looked like a bunch of stars.  I saw or heard nothing more for the rest of the night, but the next evening I looked at those two spots and did not see the bunch of stars from the night before, making me think it was some kind of camouflage.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
((HOAX??))  I had just bought a video game and my mom was driving us home.  it was like 9FT off of the ground and kinda small.;2015-03-05 08:30:00;3 minutes;I had just bought a video game and my mom was driving us home.  it was like 9FT off of the ground and kinda small. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Probable hoax, we suspect.  Time may be flawed.  We wonder whether the alleged event was in the morning, or evening.  PD));48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
