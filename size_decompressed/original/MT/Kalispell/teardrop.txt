Mettalic, teardrop shaped object hover in the sky above house;2006-10-15 18:00:00;About 20 min;Mettalic, teardrop shaped object hover in the sky above house My family and I were sitting on our deck eating dinner when my stepfather pointed at somthing in the cloudless sky.  My mother and I looked up and saw a teardrop shaped object directly above us.  It looked as though the exterior was chromed, it gleamed in the evening sun.  It was probably 20,000 to 30,000 feet in the air.  It was just hovering in one area.   Suddenly, it moved very, very, quickly about 400 yards to our left.  After hovering there for about 2min it dropped to only a couple hundred feet above the ground.  It seemed to be observing somthing on the ground.   Then the object moved back up to its original height.  And in the blink of an eye it dissapeared over the mountains.  I was so hyptnotized by it that I couldn't move.  I was just transfixed on it.  I had never seen anything like that before in my life.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
Objects seen in Montana's Glacier Nat'l Park;2007-08-03 16:00:00;?;Objects seen in Montana's Glacier Nat'l Park ON August 3rd 2007 a friend taking pictures with my digital camera while on vacation in Montana’s Glacier Nat’l Park recorded the image of 3 silvery, domed shaped objects . She did not see the images at the time the photo was taken but they are quite evident in the picture. She was taking pictures of the sun as it shown, dimly through a thick layer of smoke from nearby forest fires. To the right of the sun is a silvery object, resembling a bicycle helmet. I have asked 2 professional photographers and they assured me the image is not a prism, or lens reflection and the object does exist in the setting in which it was pictured.  Also pictured is a round silvery blur, which though more distinct, may be explained as a reflection off the lens. Under that object is a smaller cigar shaped object. Please respond to this email for a copy of the photo.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
