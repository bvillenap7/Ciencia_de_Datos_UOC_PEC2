Cigar shaped, silver object seen briefly over Kalispell, Montana;1970-06-10 13:00:00;1 sec;Cigar shaped, silver object seen briefly over Kalispell, Montana 12/08/11  My name is ((name deleted)), male, age 57. I was born and raised and am still living here in Kalispell, MT. While in high school here Kalispell, 1970, (flathead high school)  I was at the football field (Rawsen Memorial) in a marching band practice. I happened to look up to the north and in the blink of an eye, I saw a silver, cigar shaped object heading east.  It made a very brief phhtt sound I recall.  In the brief time period in which I saw it, it absolutely appeared to be way up in the sky and it instantaneously appeared and disappeared and thatâ€™s the last I saw of it.   I absolutely do not connect this object with anything like a model rocket.  I had flown model rockets in early years, and the UFO I saw did not have any of the characteristics of any kind of rocket, model or full sized.  It was flying horizontally toward the east over a residential area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
