I saw a orange light slightly brighter and bigger than a star travelling in a direction of ESE.;1998-02-20 20:30:00;2 to 3 minutes;I saw a orange light slightly brighter and bigger than a star travelling in a direction of ESE. I could have been a plane but the light did not blink as one would on a plane. It could also have very well been a low orbit satelite. However, where I live there is enough light that I usually cannot see such things. It wasn't moving very fast nor did it do any spectacular stunts. I figured that I should report it any way, just in case.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959

Several nights of sightings;2003-08-05 23:37:00;1 hour +;Several nights of sightings Last night we saw a bright light around 2330 this is around the same time that we saw it before a couple of nights ago.  The light is in the same area as before also.  I walked over to my neighbors house and we all watched it with our binoculars for an hour or so.  This time we were able to see a red light that seemed to change positions around the light at times.  It would move slowly around in the same basic vicinity.  I don't know who to report this to so I decided to sign on again. Myself and my husband and two of our neighbors all saw it.  None of them belived it to be a satillite. It is also back tonight again a bright light same approximate time and area in the sky.  So we've seen it three separate nights in the last week. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting may have been caused by a celestial body, either a star or a planet.  PD));48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
A slow large starlike,high object,followed us to driveway,stopped,then high speed flee into red speck lite;2004-03-20 19:50:00;5 miutes;A slow large starlike,high object,followed us to driveway,stopped,then high speed flee into red speck lite While standing in back of pick-up, from the barnyard to our driveway,I observed a light the size of the largest star moving slowly (like us) from west to east. It stayed with us as we drove west   to east & was as high up as a very high jet but silent. In driveway, I went to my husbands' open door window & pointed up at about a 70 degree above horizon in a SE direction as I faced south now & it had stopped moving when we stopped. I said What's that?  The dog got in his lap & stuck her head out the window so he couldn't see a thing.  I opened the door, the dog jumped out, my husband got out, I pointed up and said, That!  But before he could raise his eyes, it disappeared into the east horizon as a red light speck..out of sight!  It had to go thousands of mph to do that!! It was like it heard me trying to show it to my husband that clear, starfilled Saturday night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
Bright light speeds out of atmosphere;2012-06-11 02:00:00;Two minutes;Bright light speeds out of atmosphere Very fast bright light moving west to east across the sky.  Didn't look like a satellite!  Bright as it was overhead but dimmed lots when it moved away from us.  Then it disappeared.  Looked as if it were gaining altitude.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
Orange circle (Like a super large sun at night) twice the size of a full moon.;2013-06-12 23:35:00;15 minutes;Orange circle (Like a super large sun at night) twice the size of a full moon. While I was standing outside letting my dogs do to the bathroom a small orange light appeared over the mountains northwest of Kalispell (Near were the sun is currently setting).  At first I thought it was a plane coming through the clouds with its lights on.  But soon after noticing it the light become larger and larger until it appeared to be twice the size of a full moon through partial cloud cover and then stopped growing.   At first I wasn't sure what to think of it so I ran inside and grabbed my significant other.  I pointed out what I was seeing and she told me that maybe it was the moon.  I told her there was no way the moon was that far northwest at the current time (11:30ish PM).  I proceeded to go back inside grab my phone to confirm using Google Sky Map the current location of the moon as it was cloudy outside and we couldn't see the moon.   We then got on the computer and looked up luner cycles to get further clarification on the moons current location.  I went back outside to take a photograph and it was gone.   I then ran back inside and told my significant other it was gone and we both stood outside in disbelief... I should have taken a picture as soon as I noticed it... I dont know what I was thinking.  My first confirmed sighting of something odd and I was more in shock and trying to disprove what I was seeing I guess.  I won't let that happen again and will be spending more time looking up.  The best way I can describe it was it glowed like the color of sun but twice as large... partially behind cloud cover.  Blew my mind.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
Stationary amber dots of light that looked like planets that got brighter and moved slightly to the S SW then faded away with no sound;2013-07-06 22:30:00;3-4 minutes;Stationary amber dots of light that looked like planets that got brighter and moved slightly to the S SW then faded away with no sound Stepped outside last night (7-06-13) at about 10:30 PM to smoke a cigarette and on the western horizon above the dim glow of the setting sun I could see several stars/planet's beginning to emerge but then I noticed what I thought was another planet that stood out as a bright amber dot of light and just bellow it and to the north slightly was another dot of light (same color) but not as bright. As I stood there watching, wondering what planetary objects they were, the brightest one began to move slowly to the south, south west and then it begin to fade and within a matter of 20 to 30 seconds it had faded away.  The other light continued to just sit still and then it begin to get brighter and then it begin to move slightly to the south, south west as well, then it begin to dim and within a matter of 20 to 30 seconds it also faded away. As I stood there looking up into the sky I was wondering what I had just seen as there was no sound associated with the sighting, and then another light appeared in the same area! it also got brighter for a brief period of time and begin to move south south west and it also faded away.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959

1 green light flying horizontally across the sky, then going down towards the ground at 45 degree angle.;2015-11-24 21:20:00;2 seconds;1 green light flying horizontally across the sky, then going down towards the ground at 45 degree angle I was driving south on Hwy. 93 between Whitefish and Kalispell.  To my left (east) I saw a green light.  It was either circular, or flat on the bottom to make a thimble shape.  There was no trail on the light.  It flew horizontally across the sky then dropped down below the tree-line.  It was going too fast to be an airplane, and the light was also much larger than what would be found on an airplane.  It could not have been a meteor because it was going horizontally across the sky, and switched to go down at about a 45 degree angle, and it was too close to the earth to be a meteor.  It was not the Northern Lights because there was just this one moving light.  There is an airport and military base in the area.  It followed a flight path like I'd imagine a missile might.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
There were three orange lights in the sky moving somewhat erratically, then faded away while still in the sky.;2019-02-10 20:20:00;15 minutes;There were three orange lights in the sky moving somewhat erratically, then faded away while still in the sky. It was snowing, so there were no visible stars in the sky when I left to pick up my teenage son from work.  Before I left my house I noticed an orange light in the sky with a red light directly underneath it.  I immediately dismissed it as an airplane and left.   On the way back from my son's work (only about half a mile away), we both noticed the orange light in the same spot where I saw it when I left to pick him up, only now there were three of them traveling south with no apparent pattern.  They were moving close to each other, then further away, then close again.  The first one fizzled out (for lack of better words), slowly followed by the other two, with the last one taking several seconds longer to fade out.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
