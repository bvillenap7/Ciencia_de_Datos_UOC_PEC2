Sighting of three craft over Kalispell MT, in a triangle flight pattern the strangest redish orange light from each one.  I have never seen this kind of light on any aircraft before.  The light was constent, no flashing aircraft lights on any of the craft.  Their was no noise from the craft. after three minutes they broke formation and went so hi it looked like two left the atmosphere at a high rate of speed the third stayed in sight for one to two more minutes.  At first the three craft where traveling south to north, when they changed directions west to east as they left the atmosphere.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
