Relatively low altitude discerned from change in perspective of chevron shape. I was out on my deck observing the sky prior to retiring for the night.  I was looking more or less directly overhead at the constellation Cygnus when motion caught my eye.  Turning to my right, I witnessed 5 (or perhaps 7) faint, diffuse, eliptical white lights in a distictly V shaped formation, traveling quite rapidly from north to south approximately 45-50 degrees above the horizon.  I had them (it?) in view for approximately 5 seconds before they dissapeared behind a neighbor's tree.  They appeared to be relatively close, at a low altitude as I could see a definate change in perspective of the V as it first approached and then receded across the sky.  Viewing conditions that night were excellent with no cloud cover at all and no wind.  There was absolutely no sound whatsoever associated with this sighting.  The ambient noise level was very low with no road traffic or other neighborhood noise present.  A cold chill ran down my spine, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I was absolutely stunned.  It took a couple of hours of lying in bed before I finally fell asleep (totally out of character for me).;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959

Adding observation that when the objects made turns, they did not bank like an airplane or a bird.  Their pitch attitude remained zero or level during maneuvers and turns.  Their wings level attitude or bank remained zero or level during maneuvers and turns.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
Kenneth Arnold 2014.;2014-06-25 13:03:00;4 minutes;Kenneth Arnold  2014. I was sitting on my porch getting some sun and I happen to look up into the beautiful  summer sky with scatted cumulus at 8,000 feet, when I noticed what looked like at first seagulls riding thermals.  They never flapped and moved around as if playing a game of “tag”.   They were about the size of a Cessna C-182 and bright white in color, silent with no lights visible.    Other  “objects”  came in from the south joining the group bringing the total number up to at least 6 and possible as many as nine.   Still maneuvering around at approx. 8,000 feet, the objects were moving at about 80 knots and made wide turns while staying in the same area overhead.    After about 4 minutes the objects started to depart to true North and traversed from the 12 o’clock position to the 2 o’clock position in 1 second at 8,000 feet agl.   Then one by one the objects accelerated to approx. true North at blistering speeds.    Seconds later a business jet departed Glacier Park International airport climbing out on a southbound heading.   This sighting reminded me of the Kenneth Arnold sighting of June 24th, 1947.   I “Googled” Kenneth Arnold and the imaged of what he saw matched almost exactly what I watched today.  WOW !;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
