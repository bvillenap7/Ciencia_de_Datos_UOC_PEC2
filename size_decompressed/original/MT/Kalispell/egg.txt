Bright Orb/Sphere in western sky with Red/Blue/Green rotating lights.;2013-06-12 22:45:00;20 minutes;Bright Orb/Sphere in western sky with Red/Blue/Green rotating lights. In the West Sky slightly North and below the moon was a glowing bright yellow/white light.   With Binoculars and Spotting scope it looked to have a rotating Blue/Red/Green light around it. At first it did not seem to be moving.  Then it started moving North and appeared to be heading lower in altitude but it could have been that the distance change made it look like a drop in altitude.  It seemed to be sphere shaped but also may have been slight egg or oblong shaped.  At 60x it wasn't easy to discern the exact features.   Also strangely earlier in the day around 1pm there was a military jet that took off from Glacier International airport and flew toward the West.  It was reported as flying sideways and flew fast enough that it shook buildings.    It was thought to be a Harrier but that's not confirmed.
