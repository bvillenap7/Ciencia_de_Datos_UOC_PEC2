Explosion of blue in the dark that only lasted seconds;2019-01-07 07:26:00;5-10 seconds;Explosion of blue in the dark that only lasted seconds It was still dark out as I was driving into town, wooded mountain area.  Then a large area of the sky was a teal blue, it quickly got huge like an explosion.  The lighter blue was further away but the explosion of blue filled the sky above us.  It was blue like the icon that shows your cars bright lights are on.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  I asked on our local Facebook page and other people saw it too, some posted videos.  I’ve seen meteor showers, this wasn’t like that.  People reported seeing weird lights from 9pm yesterday into midnight and then this morning.  The variation between the two blues were distant from each other yet blended as one.  But definitely far apart.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
