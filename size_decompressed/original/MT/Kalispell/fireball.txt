Bright light getting brighter and shrinking to its' center a beacon went back and forth across the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2004-03-16 22:00:00;30 minutes;Bright light getting brighter and shrinking to its' center a beacon went back and forth across the sky As I was talking on the phone a very bright light appeared and I told the person on the phone what I was seeing and almost immediately it disappeared.  It soon returned in the exact place where I had seen it before, it became very bright, a beacon type light could be seen going back and forth. It became very bright only to shrink to it's center as if it moved away very rapidly.  This happened 5 times in approximately 20 minutes.  Same location in the sky.  I stayed in the same spot and even went outside to a line of site in line with the position I had inside.  The light was appearing just behind a row of trees, I made certain that the light re-appearing and disappearing was not just the trees getting in the way.  When the light was at its brightest it appeared to change colors on the outer edges from a brick red to an amber yellow. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness.  Probably Venus in the western sky.  PD));48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959

This would have been close to the football field but I noticed it kept its distance.     I have seen this same craft three times all at night over the period of a year.    I know planes and military aircraft and this is not a plane or helecopter and I know the direction the planes fly over town and this has never followed any of those paths. ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, witness indicates that the date may be approximate, but indicates a sighting on New Year's Eve.  PD));48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
