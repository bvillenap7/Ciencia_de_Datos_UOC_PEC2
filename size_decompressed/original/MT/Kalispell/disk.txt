Since 1996, we have seen UFOs with flashing red, blue, green, and white lights circle our house apx. 2 miles above us onece every month.  They come around between the hours of 9pm and 2am.  When we flash small laser lights at them, they come closer.  They stay in the same spot for hours at a time and alternate directions every 15 minutes or so.  They are tilted sideways and appear to be sousers.  There is a local private airline a mile from us and they have said nobody flies that time of night (it is too risky).  They do not leave untill the morning dew starts to fall about 4 hours before sunrise.  Onece they had flashed a pure yellowish-white light down for a few seconds then left.  Both my grandfather and I had blacked out for a few seconds yet were still standing when we snaped out of it.  There is a big spot in our back yard where we had to replant the grass in result of this light.  We have taken pictures, but everytime we try to get them developed, the place we take them to refusses to give them back to us and will not say why.  Over all, we have unknown visators every month since 1996.  On a more personal note:  I would like to know why they keeping around our house, but I don't know how to get them down here to ask them that. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether celestial bodies, perhaps twinkling stars, might have been the cause of the sighting(s).  Just a guess.  PD));48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959

It moved but did not streak or zigzag.  In reference to other stars or the mountains, it appears to be similar in shape and orientation.  It is still visible.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
