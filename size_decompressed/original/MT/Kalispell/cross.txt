Then I noticed it wasn't moving like a plane would so I watched it and it would move only slightly  then be still again.  This caught my attention so I woke my husband up and we got out our binoculars and when you looked through them you could see a row of five lights then almost two sets of two from the center of the object like a cross almost.  I didn't know who to report such a sighting to so I never called anyone.  I watched it move very slowly over a period of hours approx. 1120p to 330am until it was out of sight.  I don't know what a satillite looks like and whether it has anything to do with the fires that we have been experiencing, but thats what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Given the long duration of the sighting, we believe that the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.  PD));48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
