First craft was hovering over backyard approximately 100 ft off the ground then slowly headed for the mountains.;1999-11-22 23:00:00;1 hour;First craft was hovering over backyard approximately 100 ft off the ground then slowly headed for the mountains. I was watching T.V. in the living room when I went to the kitchen, I looked out the slidding glass backdoor and saw bright lights hovering over the trees in the backyard.  I looked closer and realized what I was seeing and asked my mother if she wanted to see a UFO up close.  Then I awakened my Mother-in-law and my husband, when we came back upstairs it was heading slowly off towards the mountains.  When it reached the mountains it turned sideways to where the bottom of the craft was facing the house, the clouds arond the mountains were glowing with the light from the craft.  The first craft then desended behind the mountain and a few seconds later the second craft, coming from the southeast, approached the first at a high rate of speed and desended behind the mountains in the same area as the first.  The clouds stayed aglow for about forty-five to fifety minutes after they were no longer visible from behind the mountains, then the light just vanished. The first craft was only about a half a mile from the house when sighted, we live on five acres.  The craft was scaucer shapped with a small dome on the top, with extremely bright yellow and white lights around the exterior circumfrance of the craft and illuminated almost the entire five arces.  The bottom of the craft had a triangulare shape within the circumfrance of the craft with a red light in the center of the trangle.  Only the yellow and white lights rotated, or pulsed, counter clockwise around the craft, the red light was constant and glowed.  The second craft was the same configuration as the second where the lights are concerned, yet it was much smaller than the first.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
Large, bright light with no sound moved slowly over the Flathead Valley, MT towards the southeast, dimmed and vanished .;2009-07-16 23:30:00;5 minutes;Large, bright light with no sound moved slowly over the Flathead Valley, MT towards the southeast, dimmed and vanished . The light was bright and flying lower than a satellite.  There was no sound associated with the unidentified flying object.  The light was flying at about the same height as a jetliner would fly.  It was flying from the northwest to the southeast.  As it approached the Swan Mountain Range to the east of the Flathead Valley, MT it vanished.  I saw the object first and brought it to my roommate's attention.  He came out to see it for himself and we both saw it vanish.  Neither of us have ever seen an object like this before.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959

16 white circular objects in straight line heading east;2020-08-14 04:00:00;2 minutes;16 white circular objects in straight line heading east On August 14th, at 4am in the morning I took my dog out side.  It was a cloudless, clear morning, with no rain or unsettled weather in the forecast. I looked up and though I saw a strange new constellation of stars in a long line.  But the stars were moving.  The objects were following each other a high rate of speed in a straight line.  They were circular and bright white, no blinking lights and no sound.  They were not planes or satellites as there were 16 of them in a straight line with different spacing between them, some were closer to each other and some were further apart almost filling 3/4s of the horizon.  They were coming from the west and heading into the east and into the lightening sky.  The fact that it was 16 objects in an orderly line made me think this was a patrol or mission.  The sighting lasted 2 minutes and the objects disappeared into the dawn light.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
