Flashing blue red and yellow lights balls that are either separate at first and then they gather together after a short amount of time.  A good description would be a number of different colored balloons that you hold.  The craft flies around at about the treeline level totally silent then quickly ascends up when departing.  The craft normally approach from the NW and departs from the same way on which they came.  I live on a hill so I have a good vantage point on the valley.;48.2002108808288;-114.303784455959
