It was just above the tree line.  I turned off the radio so I could hear it, but no sound was coming from it.  It was black and triangular, and had a bit of orange on it.   Flying from the east, going west.  It was flying slower than physically possible, I dont know how it stayed in the air.  It couldnt have been going more than 30 mph, yet stayed airborne.  It was daytime so I saw it very well, was about 50 ft in length, and only about 100 yards away from me.   It disappeared behind the treeline, and shortly afterward 2 helicopters followed, also flying low but not quite as low as the craft.  I want to know what it was because it was weird and awesome.;45.6753;-108.7682
