AMAZING !!! LARGER THAN USUAL BRILLIANT FIREBALL IN WSW MIDNIGHT MONTANA SKIES.;2004-11-30 23:45:00;2-3 min ??;AMAZING !!! LARGER THAN USUAL BRILLIANT FIREBALL IN WSW MIDNIGHT MONTANA SKIES. BEAUTIFUL YELLOW-GREEN-BLUE FIRE BALL WITH ORANGE TO RED TAIL APPROACHING ALMOST PERPENDICULAR TO EARTH WITH MAYBE A 15 TO 30 DEGREE ANGLE VARIANCE?? AS I WAS TRAVELING NORTH, IT WAS IN THE W.S.W. SKIES. IT WAS LARGER THAT USUAL FOR A METEOR. THE FIREBALL WAS 1/3 TO 1/2 SIZE OF THE MOON, BUT WITH THE TAIL, IT WAS LARGER. THE SIZE MADE THIS UNUSUAL. ALSO THE BRILLIANCE AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT WAS VISABLE  IT WAS AMAZING!!I WAS SO AWE STRUCK, I COULD ONLY LOOK. IT WAS APPROX 23:45. 11/30/04 IT WAS NOT STREAKING AS ONE WOULD IMAGINE A METEOR TO BE BUT GOING SLOWER THAN I HAVE SEEN THEM.;45.6753;-108.7682
On my way home from work in Billings, Montana, I observed a huge, firey thing hanging in the sky North of Laurel, Montana where I live.;2006-01-12 07:00:00;30 minutes;On my way home from work in Billings, Montana, I observed a huge, firey thing hanging in the sky North of Laurel, Montana where I live.  I watched this thing the whole way home.  I am convinced it wasn't a plane, a cell phone tower, the moon, or anything else.  We got back in the truck at approx. 7:45pm (Mountain Time) to go look for it again and it was gone.  Please contact me back on this.  Thank you!;45.6753;-108.7682
