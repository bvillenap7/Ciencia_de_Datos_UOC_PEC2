Time was 1:15am.  My son said, What is that, What is that.   I looked up and spotted this object, had numerous lights.  You could see the shape of it, but you could also almost see through it at the same time.  There was slight cloud cover, and it was below the clouds, I'm guessing maybe 2500-3500 feet above the ground.  I'm gonna say it was roughly the size of a City Block.  The Thing was huge, and silent.   It headed to the east towards Billings.  We decided to leave and went to our vehicle about 5 minutes after spotting it.   There was a Laurel city cop, pulling out of Riverside park, as we were approaching our vehicle.  But not sure if he seen it or not.;45.6753;-108.7682

It seemed like the objects appeared out of nowhere, one light after another after another until around at least 20 objects were seen.  The duration of the sighting was between 8-10 minutes, meanwhile neighborhood dogs were barking loudly. Also noise in background is a train because I live close to railroad track. Below is a link on youtube showing the video I took. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzTb4GoqxmU;45.6753;-108.7682
