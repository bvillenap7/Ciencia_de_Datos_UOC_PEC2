very bright egg, eye shaped object seen over Castle Mountains;2010-08-18 00:15:00;30 minutes;very bright egg, eye shaped object seen over Castle Mountains We were camping in the mountains on the night we witnessed an eye, or egg shaped craft in the night sky.  At first I thought that it was just a planet like pluto or saturn.  Upon seeing the light zig-zag in the sky, I knew it was something different.  The craft would get very dim and then within a few seconds get as bright as a spot light in the night sky.  I even witnessed it lowering down to tree top level and then shoot back up in the sky.   To best describe it I would have to say it looked like the shape of an eye with one really bright side that slowly rotated like it was looking for something in the mountains and hills.  This craft could move very fast from one location to another with absolutely no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
