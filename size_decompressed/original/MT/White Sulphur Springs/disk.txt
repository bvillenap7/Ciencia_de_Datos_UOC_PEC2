Thought it was just a bright star or plane, but it was flashing red and green lights, and it did not move.   Got binoculars and could see 5 windows, or lights, in row along the shape horizontally, middle one brightest white light.  Watched for twenty minutes, tried photo, but camera wasn't catching the light at that distance in the dark.  It did not seem to move but dimmed like it had gained distance.  Clear starry night.   Checked star placement with iPad and none matched for the location. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius?
