A white or silver eye shaped craft.;2016-02-09 08:00:00;2 minutes;A white or silver eye shaped craft. Was hunting with my brother.  I was looking through the binoculars, trying to see where he was on the ridge.  I saw movement above the timber line.  I focused on it.  It was an eye shaped craft of white or silver color.  I couldn't really tell, since the sun was shining on it.   It hovered for a few minutes and then was wobbling like it was having a hard time holding its location.  Then it moved behind the timber.   It was not a plane or helicopter.  No wings or tail.  No windows or anything.   I got a very clear look at it.  Was the weirdest thing I have ever seen.  It was also very large.  Bigger than an airplane.;46.6332;-111.0506
