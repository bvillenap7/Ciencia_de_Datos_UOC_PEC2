It was very cold and the air was frozen. He came running back in after a few minutes and said come out here and look ! I went outside and there in the next ten acres of land adjoining our property was two UFO`s. It was a clear night, craft were due East from us,They had slits in the windows, blinking lights and appeared like a veil of sorts was around them and we got the impression that they  thought they could not be seen. WE live in a high valley  with  no tree`s. WE have the Castle Mountains that are about 11/4 mile from our log home to the base of the Mountains. The craft were between here and there with no buildings or houses in between this area. WE watched them for several hours and they just hovered there. It was very cold so we could only stay outside for short periods but they were there until about 4 am.;46.6332;-111.0506
