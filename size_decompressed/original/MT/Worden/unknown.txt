Small blueish-yellow/white light in the hills a few miles south of Worden, MT.;2001-05-26 21:00:00;Just a few seconds.;Small blueish-yellow/white light in the hills a few miles south of Worden, MT. It was a blueish-yellow/white bright light in the hills a few miles almost directly south from Road 11 North, in Worden where I live. My stepmom, youngest stepbrother, me and possibly my other stepbrother, saw the object sometime in May-June 2001 around 9-10pm or so. I don't know if anyone besides us seen it. I'm not sure if it was just our imagination, a small unannounced explosion, or a small meteorite that wasn't found/reported or something else. It only lasted a few seconds, so I wasn't able to grab the camera from my dad's room to take a picture. The next morning, my stepmom heard that there was a farm with dead cows and other animals in a field around the same area we saw the weird light. We aren't sure if it's true or not. Nothing else like that has happened since then ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));45.9772;-108.1619
