Fireball mile off ground under the clouds but above the tree lines.;2007-09-29 00:35:00;2 minutes;Fireball mile off ground under the clouds but above the tree lines. I was sitting outside looking west and saw this red and orange fireball. It was traveling northwest and then turned north at a relatively medium speed, below the clouds, but over the tree tops, about a mile high. The was no sound being made at all. Ran upstairs to get husband while other two witnesses observed the fireball. And then watched out the back window until we could no longer see the object as it went behind the trees and out of sight.;44.6634;-111.1009
