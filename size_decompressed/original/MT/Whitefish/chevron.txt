5 rotating chevron craft seen above Whitefish on a summer night.;2006-07-15 23:30:00;45 minutes;5 rotating chevron craft seen above Whitefish on a summer night. At approximately 23:30, I went out onto the deck to have a cigarette, facing South-East I noticed three strange chevron shaped objects. The lights were mainly white but changed to blue and to green over a period of thirty seconds. I tried timing them mentally to predict what color would come next, however there was no logical order to the color pattern.  I called my two friends onto the deck to confirm what I was seeing and after approximately twenty minutes two more lights appeared. It appeared as if one of the larger objects was emitting the smaller objects, which also resembled the same shape.  The objects slowly rotated around each other in a clockwise motion. One of the objects moved farther away from the others into the West of the sky. The movement was not smooth, rather sporadic. Eventually it returned to its orbiting formation with the other crafts.  After roughly forty-five minutes I began to get tired and had smoked nearly a pack of cigarettes watching this scene. One or two of the crafts got too far away to view any longer and I went to sleep. At a family dinner with my aunts, uncles, and cousins I mentioned seeing the lights. They said they saw the same thing and were puzzled by it as well.
