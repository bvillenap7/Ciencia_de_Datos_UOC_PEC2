Series of red/orange objects seen over Whitefish, MT;2011-08-22 22:00:00;4-5 minutes;Series of red/orange objects seen over Whitefish, MT 8-21-2011  Whitefish MT, 10:00 PM (approx) (MST)  Looking North over Big Mountain ski resort I first saw an orange/red pulsating light moving slowly in the night sky. The object appeared to be triangular. As I watched, thinking it was a flare, the object begin to climb and then make a hard right turn. Th object continued to gain altitude until it eventually went out of sight. I called my daughter and wife to come and see.  They witnessed the same event.  Then, in what seemed to be a perfectly timed succession 3 more similar objects did the exact same thing. One at a time, about 60 seconds apart.  Each object seemingly following the exact path as the previous object. We heard no sound, saw no green lights (such as an aircraft) and watched as each object slowly climbed until it was no longer visible. I have never seen anything like this.;48.4049;-114.3472
