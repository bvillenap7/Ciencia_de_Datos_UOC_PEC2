Only soundsof one aircraft. While viewing Hale Bopp in NNWsky, noticed an orange light moving quickly with an aircraft following closely behind movingwest to east.  The second object was clearly an airplane with wings, fusilage, runninglights-- visible with naked eye (andbinoculars) and sound of jet engine.Only one engine noise heard.  The orange object appeared to have 3 smaller orange lights associated with it, visible in binoculars only.These orange lights were closer together than the running lights ofthe trailing airplane, and were ina straight line.  They never seemedto move relative to one another.No visible structural bodyassociated with orange lights.The sighted plane and lights wasabout 500-1000 feet above theground and maybe 1000-2000 feetaway.  The sighting was made in anarea of tall trees, and moved quicklyout of line of sight. The aircraft trailin lights was extremely close tothe lights it followed-- at arm'sdistance about as far apart aswidth of a fist.Towards end ofsighting, the space between closed a bit.;48.4049;-114.3472
A small traveling light in the sky increased in brightness and then faded away.;2008-06-24 00:00:00;15 seconds;A small traveling light in the sky increased in brightness and then faded away. Between Aurora Borealis and the last star in the handle of Ursa Major, I saw a small light. I thought that it was a satellite crossing the sky when I first noticed it. It moved from left to right but then became brighter and brighter until it was as bright as a bright star.  I then thought that it might be a meteorite that was heading directly towards me.  The light then went dim again and seemed to be either traveling away from me into space or just faded out until it was just a pin prick of light and then I could not see it any more.  It only traveled about one inch from left to right. The sky was very clear.  I have never seen anything like this.  Did anyone else see it?;48.4049;-114.3472
Solid bright white light coming and going and a flash;2016-09-15 21:15:00;10 seconds;solid bright white light coming and going and a flash As I was exiting my truck with my girlfriend we saw a super bright, solid white light moving from SW to NE. At first I thought it was a low flying helicopter coming towards us.  As it arced upwards above our heads it started to look more like a comet or something similar.  It had a long tail for a second as it got overhead and then the tail disappeared again and it kept moving steady as a bright white light until it went out of our field of vision over trees towards Glacier National Park.  We then went inside and about 30 seconds later my girlfriend saw a bright flash of sky light up the sky which she described like a flash of lightning only no bolt.
