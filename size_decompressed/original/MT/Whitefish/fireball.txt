4 orange red fireballs hovered in front of Big Mountain and 3 hovered in a triangle formation over the mountain;2011-08-12 21:55:00;5+- minutes;4 orange red fireballs hovered in front of Big Mountain and 3 hovered in a triangle formation over the mountain I was leaving a city park and looked up at Big Mountain and saw 7 orange/red fireballs.  Four of them were in a straight line up and down in front of the mountain. At the top of the mountain three were in a triangle formation.  They weren't moving at first,  So I watched for a few minutes trying to figure out what they were and then they started moving.  The triangle moved first.  All three objects moved together as if one.  Then the line began to move up towards the top of the ridge and then as a unit they began to move away.  I moved in to traffic, trying to keep an eye on them and when I got to the viaduct they were all gone.;48.4049;-114.3472
Flaming orange orb moving at high rates of speed, often becoming very bright.;2013-07-04 23:00:00;1 hour;Flaming orange orb moving at high rates of speed, often becoming very bright. On July 4th, about ten of us were witnesses to a bright orange orb that flew West to East twice, than about an hour later it flew right over us going South over the town of Whitefish, MT.  It was moving way too fast to be a Chinese lantern or flaming Hot air balloon.  It looked round, or oval shaped and seemed to be flaming, often becoming very bright.   There must have been many people in Whitefish that saw it, but it was being dismissed by some as being some kind of firework.  However, I have never seen a firework that traveled that fast, and stayed lit, becoming very bright at times.;48.4049;-114.3472
Orange ball of light over Whitefish, MT.;2014-01-25 22:30:00;5 minutes;Orange ball of light over Whitefish, MT. It was a cloudy evening when my girlfriend and I were driving into town when I pointed out a bright orange light that looked similar to a star.  It hovered in the same spot for about 30 seconds before it started to move.   At first, we thought it was a plane or helicopter, but it was traveling in a zigzag pattern and produced no sound and unlike a plane, the light did not flash.   It moved in this way for what appeared to be about two miles in the sky before it disappeared.   Later on, a couple of fireworks went off in town and I dismissed the experience as possibly being one of those.   However, the more I thought about it, I realized it was no firework and was something I had never seen before.;48.4049;-114.3472
