Circular Craft Flashing a Red Beam;1999-09-23 22:00:00;10 min;Circular Craft Flashing a Red Beam We were driving down the road when my friend stopped his truck, saying he saw something in the sky.  It was a clear night and where we were you could see most of the stars.  We got out, and at first I could only see the moon, until the moon started moving back and forth in the sky.  It became stationary again, and started flashing a red beam.  There didn't seem to be any pattern to the flashing - sometimes it would be a long beam, then off, then two short beams, something like that.  The craft stopped flashing, and flew away behind the mountain.  The entire event took place for about 10 minutes.  I know this happened a while ago, but I saw a similiar report posted from Hungry Horse and thought it might be helpful. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));48.4049;-114.3472
Bright flying object with red and white flashing lights, soundless, moving erradically.;2005-06-26 00:00:00;1 minute;Bright flying object with red and white flashing lights, soundless, moving erradically. The night sky was clear with stars showing.  The object came into view while I was staring out the window lying in bed.  It was white with red and white flashing lights.  The lights were strobing fast.  The object seemed to be moving fast, erradically, zigzagging, making turns in sharp corners.  Maybe tumbling. It was heading first West, then N. west , then No.  I went to the window and saw it pass out of my view.  I went from window to window and then ran outside.  It was gone.  It had made no sound -- I had the window open.  It had the whole open sky before it  so it should have been there when I went outside.  I am actually not sure what the shape was.  It appeared small and white and high but the lights were brilliant.;48.4049;-114.3472
We looked up and saw what we thought was a star or a planet then it took off and became a dim light.
