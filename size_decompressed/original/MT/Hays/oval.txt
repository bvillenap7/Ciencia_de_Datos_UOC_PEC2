Well, I was just about to fall asleep on the couch when I noticed a yellow/white light in the sky.  At first I thought it was a star but then I got up and looked outside and noticed it was completely cloudy outside and there were no stars out.   I woke my dad’s girlfriend up to ask her if she was seeing what I saw and she saw it too, so I knew I wasn’t just seeing things. We watched the light for some time before we noticed it was moving/ hovering at the same time.  She started to get freaked out so she layed down and tried to go to sleep.  While she layed down I layed there just staring at it like I was in a daze.  Then the light got brighter then started to dim. I woke her up and told her to watch the light with me once more, and then it was gone, just like that!  Soon after the light disappeared the wind picked up and blew at least 45-50mph. After that, our dogs went toward the area where the light was and came back yelping scared.  Soon after that, something hit out horse trailer hard. It was an experience that I will never forget.  I was so scared I couldn’t even move! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));47.9878;-108.6925
