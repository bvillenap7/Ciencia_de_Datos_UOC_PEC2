Diamond shaped object with NO sound moving from south to north;2009-06-18 21:42:00;2 minutes;Diamond shaped object with NO sound moving from south to north My wife & myself were out in our front yard and saw what appeared to be an object that looked like a small fire on the mountain across from our residence.  We then realized it was moving and was in front of the mountain.  We watched it move from south to north as it slowly lost altitude and became dimmer.  My wife ran into the house and grabbed the camera and we got a few pictures of it.  Upon looking at the pictures it didn't look red (like fire) but white and after cropping the picture it appeared to be diamond shaped.  There was absolutely NO noise what-so-ever coming from this craft at any time during the sighting.  It eventually became so dim we couldn't see it any more.;48.4796;-115.8786
