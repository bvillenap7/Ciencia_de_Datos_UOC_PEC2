Yankee Stadium in the middle of nowhere;2000-09-09 03:30:00;2 minutes;Yankee Stadium in the middle of nowhere I was on vacation in Livingston Mt. last Sept. In a field a few miles above North Gate-Yellowstone Park. In the middle of the night about 3:30am, the whole valley lights up like Yankee Stadium, and with not a peep. It stayed lit without movement of any kind for at least 40 seconds. It came back a second time moments later for about 20 seconds, and went away again. I came out of my Mini-Van the first, and the second time looking for a truck, but my eyes looked to the sky both times like I was having some sort of an invitation or something. It felt like I was hiding behind a tree, and I was witnessing a serious crime,  thus knowing the silence  was very strange. Blew it off, went to sleep and woke early just to find an open field with a bumpy dirt road, and no main road near enough to provive any lights. The sound of the yahoo's pick-up aproaching convinced me-------UFO.......  If you want the story, let me know.......â€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness who submitted this report, and he asserted that the incident occurred as described above.  We have requested a report from his girlfriend.  PD));45.0832;-110.5697
