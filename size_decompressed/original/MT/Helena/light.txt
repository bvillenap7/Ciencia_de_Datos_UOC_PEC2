Two lights as bright as meteors moving north & east respectively almost collide, swerve and change direction dramatically.;2001-07-11 00:33:00;5 mins?;Two lights as bright as meteors moving north & east respectively almost collide, swerve and change direction dramatically. At about 12:30 am two witnesses stepped out onto the lawn to discuss Mars and Antares. As they were looking at Mars in the southern sky, a bright light moving north from out of the south caught their attention. The object grew brighter in intensity and at first seemed as if it must be a meteor, but highly unusual as the brightness seemed almost too much to look at directly. It quickly grew to be twice as bright as venus, and then faded again. The still visibly bright light was suddenly joined by another bright light catching up to it as it moved north -- the two objects seemed to interact with each other. The two objects seemed about to collide with each other, then suddenly swerved or danced around each other, and then both lights zipped off in opposite directions, one to the east and one to the west. In the witnesses' opinions the objects could not have been weather baloons or satellites.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
Shimmering light of many colors, moving in a random pattern, lying low on the W horizon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD));2004-10-08 22:30:00;30 minutes;There was a shimmering light of many colors, moving in a random pattern, lying low on the western horizon near Helena, MT. Upon looking up at the zenith at roughly 10:30PM on October 8, 2004, I bore witness to a glistening light of manifold colors on the lower edge of the western horizon.  At first my logical conclusion was that this phenomenon was merely an air plane or a sattelite, however, after a prolonged staredown I realized that this phosphoresent blob in the night's sky was moving at an irregular and unpredictable pattern.  The star-like figure would remain static, flickering with coloration and then would suddenly--not to mention erratically--begin to whimsically gyrate in no measurable pattern.  These movements took on many directions--spiral, circular, up-and-down, and horizontal--in a random fashion.  After approximately 25-30 minutes of viewing this abnormal astral occurrance the intensity of the light emanating from the object began to taper off, and eventually the phenomenon departed entirely over the westward horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we reached the tentative conclusion that he might have been observing a twinkling star.  PD));46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957

IT IS PART OF ORIONS BELT. THE RIGHT(3RD) STAR. I NOTICED IT AS I LOOKED UP (BECAUSE) OF ITS UNUSUAL SHARP BRILLIANCE. I GAZED UPON IT FOR NO MORE THAN 5 SECONDS WHEN IT.....JUST..BEGAN MOVING STEADILY NORTH FOR @ 10-12 SECONDS AND THEN DIMMED OUT REDDISH AND...LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WENT LIKE UP, OUT OF OUR ATMOSPHERE....UNLIKE HOW A PLANE OR SATELLITE WOULD FOLLOW THE SKY/ HORIZON..  IT LOOKED LIKE IT WENT AT AN ANGLE OF APPARENT HIGHER DESCENT AS IT STOPPED AND WAS GONE FROM VIEW.. I WILL TELL YOU THIS..  I AM A US NAVY VETERAN OF 6 YEARS, AS AN MA2 (NAVAL SECURITY FORCES, MP). I HAVE SERVED ON VERY HIGH PROFILE MISSILE BASES IN KAUAI, BARKING SANDS MISSILE RANGE, OR PMRF(PACIFIC MISSILE RANGE FACILITY) AT BARKING SANDS ISLAND, AND I WAS SENT THERE EVERY 2 WEEKS IN 2009.

Bright lite, like a sparkler, spinning and throwing out colors every which way.;2014-09-03 23:01:00;30 minutes;Bright lite, like a sparkler, spinning and throwing out colors every which way. Flashes of light going in every direction.  At first it went from right to left and sort of bounced around just flashing everywhere.  Red, Green, and Diamond colors spinning around, out of control like.   After 15 minutes, it dropped down and travelled west into the clouds.   About 7 minutes later it was back in the same area.   After doing its sparkling dance, it turned into a laser show and had made designs, being just as bright as before.   Then it dimmed significantly.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
Strange lights and colors along with rumbling/zapping sounds over a house in the rural valley.;2019-03-28 01:00:00;~1 minute;Strange lights and colors along with rumbling/zapping sounds over a house in the rural valley. I had a terrible anxious feeling while streaming Youtube, and suddenly turned it off . Almost immediately afterwords, a light seemed to appear over the house, (where there are no lights, this is out in the rural valley).  It was so bright that it completely flooded the room and had the color of a fluorescent bulb. My partner came into the room, and we stood to look out the window together. The light came and went along with green and blue lights and a small amount of red light. We opened the window to see if we could hear anything, and there were rumbling sounds that were like distant thunder (but constant), and then a very loud zapping sound, as if from an electric wire snapping and what appeared to be flashes like sparks above the house. Several more times the bright flashes of colors and white light appeared until we ran out of the room to wake up my family.  By the time they came to look, there was no sign of any lights, any sounds whatsoever and the sky appeared to be a pink color.  (this was at night)  We were initially worried a transformer exploded somewhere or that there was an attack or something.  It was snowing at the time, but no reports of thunder/lighting or any grid issues in the area. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thanks a bunch!  I also decided that you are free to use my name for this report.  I'm having my boyfriend submit one when he gets home. Also, of note:  Just found out that all of our power sources are buried out there, so it couldn't be a transformer blowing.   Also, my father heard the loud zapping noise from the other side of the house, but couldn't see the lights from where he was. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.

Couple sees bright flashing lights, beams, and obtrusive noise.;2019-03-28 01:00:00;3 minutes;Couple sees bright flashing lights, beams, and obtrusive noise. It was late night, and I was walking into my partner's room to lay down.  Upon entering the room, she told me she had seen a bright light shining into the room and was abnormally concerned.   I turned to look out into the back yard, and within seconds, a bright light shifting from green, blue, white and then a small flash of red.  It lasted between 1-3 seconds and was incredibly bright.   We threw open the window and tried to listen for any noise or to see anything.  There was a low grumbling noise similar to rolling thunder, and within a few moments, another multicolored bright flash lit the sky and backyard.   This time, late in the flash a sharp, electric buzzing noise chimed in and gradually faded away along with the light.   Shocked, my partner ran to wake her siblings while I watched the window, and then met up with her father.  Upon going outside to inspect the sky there were no more flashes, but after the incident, there remained a red tinted glow in the horizon! for an extended period of time.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
