Shaped like an egg the craft had now alternating lights of any kind that I could see. It is a very dark night tonight with many stars to use as referance points,so I would say the craft was moving at a fairly fast speed. was able to observe with binoculars, but was unable to identfy any further than to say it was a very bright egg shaped craft.
