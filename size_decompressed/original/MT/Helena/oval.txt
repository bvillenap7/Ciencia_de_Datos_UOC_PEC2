Green orb stationary, accelerates to unimaginable speed, and vanishes.;2013-11-02 18:40:00;2-3 seconds;Green orb stationary, accelerates to unimaginable speed, and vanishes Spotted a large bright green orb to the west of Helena.  The object was within the atmosphere, and disappeared near the continental divide. Object was stationary, and accelerated to an unimaginable speed.  The abrupt movement was not natural.  The object either vanished, or disappeared over the horizon. Both witnesses instantly got goosebumps, turned to each other, and confirmed that they saw the same thing. It's hard to imagine that this was man made or a governmental experiment.  The sudden movement and acceleration defies we would even consider to be physically possible.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957

We were driving I-90 W at about 11:11 pm. Witness # one's perspective: a white light approximately 6,000 ft appeared stationary  Then accelerated to speeds that were unexplainable and disappeared.  Upon acceration the light turned to two green lights on an oval shape craft. Witness #2: An oval shaped craft with green lights appeared to  plummet spinning towards the ground at an alarming rate of speed.  At first it was thought to be an airplane that was going down but then it picked up to such speeds it was unimaginable and disappeared in the the night sky.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
