Saucer shaped object hovering on ridge between two mountain peaks..about 300 yds out.;1979-02-10 09:30:00;appox.5 min;Saucer shaped object hovering on ridge between two mountain peaks..about 300 yds out. I don't recall the exact date,I believe around Feb.1979 outside of Helena,Montana..around 9:30am My boss had sent a co-worker and I to Welch's Truck Stop in Garrison, Montana to pick up a dump truck and drive it back to Helena. We started out around 9:10 and headed west on Hwy.12 towards Garrison,as you drive west on the outskirts of town,Hwy 12 narrows from a 4 lane to a 2 lane road and enters a narrow canyon. I was looking out the passenger window as we drove along the hwy..Just after we passed the Blue Cloud Ranch,I looked out I saw a saucer shaped object hovering between to mountain peaks..about 300 yds out and 250ft elevation. I glanced at it and then did a double take as I realized what I was seeing. I yelled What the hell is that?and when I did the driver looked over and caught a glimpse of the object. We turned around at Colorado Gulch Rd. and headed back to get another look. Just as we turned around and headed back,we saw the object slowly descend behind a peak and out of our view...it descended at about a 45 degree angle. We stopped along the road,amazed at what we saw...We then turned around and headed back towards Garrison. When we returned back to Helena,we told my boss and our co-workers what we saw.. Everybody kinda chuckled and we went about our business. I had made of drawing of the object with time and date on a piece of paper and kept it,but have now since lost it. The object was saucer shaped,the skin looked like shiney aircraft aluminum, it had a red stripe across the mid section,and when it descended,we observed what looked to be a tail fin. I thought about reporting it at the time but i didn't,also I thought about asking the residents in the area if they had seen anything unusual..but I never followed up on it.  A note of interest,The land behind where we saw this object is a military reservation..Fort William Henry Harrison, birth place of the special forces..  Green berets,Rangers etc.  They have annual mountain warfare training there in the summer and winter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

in august 2001 my entire family saw two formations of saucer-like objects form & unform over about 30-40 minutes;2001-08-14 22:00:00;app35 minutes;in august 2001 my entire family saw two formations of saucer-like objects form & unform over about 30-40 minutes it was just prior to sunset in august, last year. My son and his s.o. were taking me with them to my ex-wife's home. we were west bound on Euclid Ave. I saw what I thought was a metior a bright orange trail of light crossing diagonally from high in the north to low in the south above the mountanous horizon. I pointed it out to my son and his girl. As we watched it came to a halt, from nearly, if not, mach speed to hovering. it appeared to be to the right of a mountain, thogh I am sure it was much farther west and highert (perhaps over the Pacific). Other saucer shaped objects came from other directions at a much slower speed. We got to my ex's, got her, my other two sons and daughter, went to a parking lot where the view was unobstructed, and we all watched as somehere around a dozen similar objects formed into a diamond formation, hovering. at times one or two would leave the formation for short durations then rerturn. another similar formation took shape appearing to the left of the mountain, and some of those objects left and returned from time to time. We were all fascinated by this sight. i commented that i hoped they weren't cowboy aliens here to round up human cattle for their tables, or aliens that figured they'd best eliminate this warlike speices from the universe before we become a danger to them. then both formations broke off into various directions. I didn't call the radio station as i was somewhat intoxicated. none of the others were intoxicated. thogh it's been a about a year this event is still indellibly etched in my memory. i would even suspect myself of toxic halucination if it hadn't been seen by the entire family.

It appeared as though the choppers were searching for  it as they flew around the area for hours after.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
