((Starlink satellites));2020-04-09 21:45:00;15 minutes;I saw the ISS then looked further west and noticed four lights, about the intensity of stars, moving from North to South trailing each other.  There were at least four visible at one time, but as one disappeared to the south, another would appear and travel with the rest.  There was a constant light, no noise or flashing navigation lights and I already spotted the ISS which went through the big dipper and traveled the opposite direct, so I am wondering what these were.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
