As I was going to work at 0410, I observed a green, pulsating orb descending diagonally downward. The orb had a large bright center with its edge brightness kind of looking misty or foggy. The green orb pulsated slowly but it descended very rapidly. It disappeared before it touched the ground.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
Green orb falls out of sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2014-08-19 02:11:00;~2 seconds;Green orb falls out of sky. I was out on the porch having a cigarette, looking to the east.  A very large green orb fell out of the sky, nearly straight downward, at an alarming rate of speed.  From my vantage point, it appeared to fall all the way to the ground.  I heard no sound.  I looked at the clock inside and immediately noted the time, 2:11 am. I considered the possibility that this might have been a meteor, however, this orb appeared much larger than any meteor I've seen before and it did not leave a fire or smoke trail like many of the larger meteors I've seen. About 1 minute before I witnessed the falling green orb, there had been an airplane flying directly overhead from west to east.  It appeared to be an airliner flying at cruising altitude with all the standard flashing nav lights. After the sighting of the green orb, I noticed the plane was no longer anywhere in sight, which I found peculiar because at the speed it was traveling it could not have made it all the way out of my sight within that short time period.  There was no cloud cover.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
4 or 5 Amber orbs, 20 seconds apart approach Helena MT from the south then turn east over the capitol building.;2015-04-12 20:00:00;5 minutes;4 or 5 Amber orbs, 20 seconds apart approach Helena MT from the south then turn east over the capitol building. My son came in and said there was a amber orb in the sky.  We went to the porch facing east.  He pointed toward the Capitol building and said it was right there but we saw nothing.   Then out of the south, another orb moving north towards us.  Over the capitol it changed direction and headed east.  No sound, just a sphere of amber-orange light.   About 20 seconds later another orb flying  along the same flight path as the first ones.  We saw 4 in about 2 minutes.   There was a thin low cloud bank to the east and as they past behind it you could still see the light but faded.  It was otherwise a clear sky, well lit, with no wind.   I can estimate their speed at 200 to 400 MPH.  I can estimate their altitude at around 2500 FT.  They appeared to be climbing.   All 4 or 5 seemed to follow each other's flight path and speed.  Flying N-NE in a straight line over the south hills, then turning east as they were about over the capitol building.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
Bright orange/reddish circular light over Helena, Montana.;2016-12-11 17:45:00;17:50;bright orange/reddish circular light over Helena, Montana. Wondering if anyone saw light in sky above Helena Montana on Sunday Dec. 11th 2016 approximately 5:45 pm?  Walked outside to get some wood for stove and a bright light red or orange in color moving north over Mount Helena from the south, speed was slow like a helicopter but no noise, maybe about 1000ft in altitude.  My neighbor was outside so I told him to look also and neither of us knew what it was. I went inside and grabbed my binoculars and it appeared to be bright orange on the bottom, very bright through my binoculars with no flashing lights, just solid bright orange bottom.  It began to move west then came back to the east, not circling but more in straight line.  It seemed to hover in place for a brief period then moved east while gaining altitude.  It seemed to climb at a very steep rate, but with not so much horizontal movement.  Eventually it climbed altitude out of sight. There are many national guard helicopters that fly over this area all the time and I am used to seeing them and understand the difference.  It was not an airplane, as planes cannot go west then east on which seems to be almost identical course.  A plane would have to circle, also small planes could not climb as steep as this seemed to do. It was in the sky for around 5 minutes.  It moved almost like you would expect a drone to move, but was much bigger.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
