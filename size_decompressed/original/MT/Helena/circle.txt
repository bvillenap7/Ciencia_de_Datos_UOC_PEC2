We decided to stop by Yellowstone National Park on the way back to Texas.  We were traveling south bound on highway 15 and were between Wolf Creek and Helena, MT.  The time was between 21:00 to 22:00, but don’t know the exact time.   We were in between some mountains, when I saw a circular light rise up from the mountains to my left.  I lost sight of it because of the mountains, and I thought that was strange, and we traveled a bit more southward towards Helena, MT, and the city lights were in view now.  Then I again saw the circular light moving westward slowly and always at the same altitude.  The light moved past the city slowly and initially I thought it was some kind of special helicopter or plane.  But then it accelerated very, very quickly, and made a loud whip crack like noise like a sonic boom, and some sort of smoke ring or vapor ring was formed were it had been.  The noise was very loud cause I heard it in my car several miles away traveling southbound on 15.  So finally, when it shot westward extremely fast, it traveled for several miles, and the light then disappeared.  This was all at the same altitude. I waited to report this because I did not know who to report it to, and I also did not want to be labeled as making something up or fabricating a hoax.  I know what I saw and that is what I saw, and have no reason to lie.  I’m US Army retired, and don’t want any kind of negative attention like that, but I wanted to report this and maybe collaborate any other reports given for this date and time.  Thanks again;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
I observed 2 large, circular, bright, white lights in the evening sky tonight, before any stars were shining.;2016-11-03 19:00:00;7 seconds;I observed 2 large, circular, bright, white lights in the evening sky tonight, before any stars were shining. I observed 2 large, circular, bright, white lights in the evening sky tonight, after sunset and before any stars were shining.  I had been walking down the sidewalk for an hour, and was looking at the sky after I noticed some thin noctilucent clouds directly overhead.  The two white, circular lights caught my attention where there were no clouds, about 20 degrees above the horizon.  They were of equal size (I estimate 60 feet diameter) and equal brightness, about 3 fingers apart with my arm outstretched in front of my eyes.  That is way too far apart from each other to be aircraft landing lights from a single aircraft, at what seemed like a distance of about 3 miles, South-East of downtown. I watched the 2 lights closely for 4 seconds, and noted they seemed absolutely motionless.  Then, I looked down at my cell phone for 3 seconds, in order to start my camera application, and by the time I looked back up to take a photo, both lights had disappeared. I continued walking home and watching that section of the sky for another half an hour, and they did not re-appear, neither did any stars.  During that following half an hour, any approaching aircraft would have already arrived and landed at the city airport, which was on the other side of me from the lights, and I would have easily seen any aircraft landing lights approaching and heard aircraft engines, because they would have had to pass over me to get to the airport.  Besides, aircraft do not approach the city airport from the South-East. I am a U.S. Navy Veteran Seaman of Deck Department, a trained look-out watch, having spent 3 years at sea, and experienced at identifying stars, planets, satellites, aircraft lights, etc.  There are never military fighter jets operating in this area, and only rarely are there lone military helicopters, and never flying in pairs.  I believe these lights were from craft not of this world, to have totally vanished in 3 seconds, after shining brightly and directly towards me.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957

Red balls of light on the night of November 22nd, 2017.;2017-11-22 20:23:00;2-5 minutes;Red balls of light on the night of November 22nd, 2017. Sitting on back patio looking North of Helena Valley.  5 or more red balls of light came together to form a perfect triangle.   Before I could get to my phone for video proof, they broke formation, turned white in color and slowly ascended into the sky until out of view.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
Brilliant sphere streams across the sky and then falls out of the sky!;2018-12-12 21:00:00;10 seconds;Brilliant sphere streams across the sky and then falls out of the sky! Sitting outside with our dogs we live in a rural area in the mountains the sky was very clear full of stars.  I was looking up at the stars when I noticed a brilliant sphere where the stars were.  It then fell down somewhat, moved across the sky very fast and dropped as though if fell out of the sky over a hill.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
