Orange ball in the night sky;2011-12-25 21:00:00;2 minutes;Orange ball in the night sky At 2100 on December 25, 2011, looking to the east my boyfriend and I saw an orange ball of light moving north across the sky.  The object started moving straight across the sky and then appeared to move directly upward. The orange light started to blink and quickly dimmed to look like just a star in the night sky. A few seconds later the object disappeared completely. There were not any blinking lights on the object and there did not appear to be any aircraft in the area.;46.6326148936169;-112.009212765957
