Hi Mr. Davenport,  Sitting on the porch, I looked up and saw this white looking craft going south-east, no noise, no lights.  I ran and got my digital camera and took a short video clip and a couple of pics which I zoomed in as much as I could. I ran back in and got my binoculars and ran back out, but it was gone by then.  So I came in and put the memory card into the printer and uploaded the images.  When I watched the video clip all I got was a bunch of weird noises. So just in case the camera was not workin' right, I took another short clip in the house and outside and each one of those were just fine.  I shall send these to you email.  Hopefully you can know what kind of craft like that can go thru at that altitude and not make a single bit of noise.  I've seen regular jet planes and airplanes go about and they make A LOT of noise.  It was like they were emitting some kind of static and the camera picked it up.  A couple years ago me and my ex-boyfriend were sittin' outside and we both saw one go by at that same altitude and no noise.  I didn't have a digital then tho.;46.5267;-114.0478
