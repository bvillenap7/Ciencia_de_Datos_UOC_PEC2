Object was stationary, just at the bottom edge of a bank of storm clouds that were producing lightning.  Witness watched while driving south for a couple of minutes.  Object just sat there, twinkling very brightly.  Then it appeared to back up into the bottom edge of the cloud and disappeared.  Witness first impression was that it was an airplane coming in for a landing at Missoula airport, but wondered why it just hovered there.;46.5267;-114.0478

I thought it was strange to see either/or in daylight and questioned out loud to my partner about that.   We drove past a short line of trees, that took approximately less than a minute to drive past, and when we were at a point to see the sky again, the light was gone.  It had just disappeared.  Given that it appeared stationary when first observed, it was highly unlikely that it had moved beyond the line of sight in such a short period of time at the speed that would have been necessary to do so.  I was unable to find the light again after that.;46.5267;-114.0478
