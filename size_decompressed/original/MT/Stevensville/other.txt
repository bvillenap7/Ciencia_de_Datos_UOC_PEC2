As;1999-10-20 08:15:00;one minute;looked to east saw sparkling dot with white plume coming out of top.to left of object saw fast moving aircraft leaving vapor trails. As aircraft approched object it either shot up into sky or disappered. saw in eastern sky what looked like a sparkler with plume out of the top. Getting out of my car this a.m. noticed to the east a brilliant light that was sparkling with white plumb out of the top. It was stationary in the sky. To the left(north) noticed two aircraft followed by vapor trails. These appeared to be approching the object at a fast rate of speed when object either shot up in air or winked out aircraft then turned to east and continued in that direction. Whole incident took about 1 and a half minutes. Distance was out to horizen. Weather:Typical clear big sky morning no clouds.Visabilty unlimited.;46.5267;-114.0478
Saw sparkler type light with white plume out of top in Eastern sky about 60 degrees above horizon.;1999-10-20 08:15:00;1.5 MIN;Saw sparkler type light with white plume out of top in Eastern sky about 60 degrees above horizon. Was getting out of my car in supermarket parking lot.  Looked to the East, noticed brilliant sparkling light with white plume coming out of the top.  This object appeared to be stationary.  Noticed to the left (North) two fast approaching aircraft also about 60 degrees on parrellel with object.  As aircraft approached object it appeared to dissapear or shoot straight up at extreme rate of speed.  At this point, aircraft changed position heading due East and dissapeared out of sight in a normal manner.  Weather sky clear no clouds.;46.5267;-114.0478
Growing concentric clouds with object moving in the center of the clouds very very slowly.;2015-03-12 22:00:00;10-15 minutes;Growing concentric clouds with object moving in the center of the clouds very very slowly. A circular cloud growing to double concentric circular clouds with a yellow/orange colored object in the center of the cloud.  Radius of cloud approximately between 5 to 10 moon diameters at maximum extent.   Object moved with cloud and cloud became fainter and larger over a period off 15 min but could still follow faint colored object as it moved very very slowly across the star background.  Sighting occurred first east of the star, Sirus and moved north east in the sky.   Thought initially it was a supernova but could see an object in center of cloud move with 10x50 binoculars. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the sighting is due to a fuel dump from an expended Centaur stage of an Atlas V missile launch.  We express our gratitude to Mr. Ted Molczan for the heads up on this incident.  We copy below his e-mail of March 13, 2015, about the incident.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM MR. TED MOLCZAN, OF SEESAT-L)) Hello Peter, The fuel dump from the Centaur stage of last night's Atlas V launch, was widely visible to the unaided eye from N. America. It began on Mar 13 at about 04:15 UTC, and was visible for about an hour. Ed Cannon, a long-time member of SeeSat-L, described his sighting as follows: http://satobs.org/seesat/Mar-2015/0143.html The Centaur was on a high-elevation pass, that moved west to east across the southern sky. It climbed in altitude from about 2,500 km to more than 20,000 km, on its way to its apogee of about 70,000 km. Best regards, Ted Molczan ((END ADDENDUM));46.5267;-114.0478
