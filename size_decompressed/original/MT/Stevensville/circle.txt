red circle during thunderstorm;2004-08-08 00:00:00;approx 25 minutes;red circle during thunderstorm Unable to sleep, my daughter age 18 and myself got up at midnite and decided to watch an incoming thunderstorm over the Bitter Root mountains and have a cup of tea.  This was the only thunderstorm that we had last year and the threat of fires was high.  Directly west of us is Kootenai Canyon and we were watching a wonderful display of lightning.  I spotted a red glow and assumed a fire had been started from the lightning.  I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look, and as I was observing the red glow, there was a flash of lightning, and then it sunk in that there was a huge red glowing ball above the far ridge, not anywhere near the ground and right in the middle of the incoming storm.  My daughter grabbed the other pair of binoculars and we continued to watch this stationary red ball until it was obliterated by the rain.  After the storm passed the craft was gone.

Random pictures taken of sky, then uploaded to find round object in one.;2007-06-11 09:45:00;0 minutes;Random pictures taken of sky, then uploaded to find round object in one. On the morning of June 11, 2007 I took a walk to the river.  I took my digital camera and binoculars along.  It was between 09:30 and 10:00 a.m.  On the way to the river, I had to insert new batteries into the camera, but I didn't update the time, as you can see in the picture it shows in the afternoon.  I put my camera atop the binoculars, looking through the binoculars making sure there were no birds in my view and taking random shots of the sky.  When I uploaded them on my computer, this round object was in one of the shots.  It didin't appear in any other shot.  I didn't see the object with my binoculars or without them.  There was no sound or lights.  It was a clear day with a few clouds.;46.5267;-114.0478
