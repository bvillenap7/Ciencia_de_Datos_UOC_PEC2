While driving East towards Mission Dam, St. Ignatius MT. Mission Range, about 8:30 p.m. it was cloudy weather. The site was south-east, above us paralell to the Missions.  What we both saw was at least 4 large lights, which rather looked like large head lights of a car, tumble through the sky, as if in Leap Frog.  The speed was faster than anything we knew of.  As soon as we saw them, they were gone. As soon as we seen them we both questioned the other did you just see what I saw?  Sure enough we both saw the same thing.  My fiance is Native American Flathead born and raised here. Yet he has never seen anything like that traveling so fast in his life.  I am from Washington State, and Yakima Valley.  I have never seen anything quit like that leap froggin in the sky and disapearing.;47.3323;-114.0798
