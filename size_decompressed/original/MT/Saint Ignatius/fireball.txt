Fireballs in the Sky over St. Ignatius MT;2013-07-17 23:00:00;30 sec;Fireballs in the Sky over St. Ignatius MT I was on my way home from work, driving down Main Street and I see the owner of a local bar standing outside looking up at the sky.  I look up, and see 2 HUGE FIREBALLS in the sky...one was heading south and the other was hovering just behind my houseâ€¦ I race home, pull in the driveway, and probably moved the fastest I have ever moved in my life, jumped out of my truck and watched the one hovering over the house....NO NOISE, NO BLINKING LIGHTS!!  Then it just winked out, disappeared!  So, I race back uptown to see if bar owner is still outside, and she's there talking to a cop and someone else who saw THREE of these fireballs.  Her husband and one other man that I know of saw them as well.;47.3323;-114.0798
