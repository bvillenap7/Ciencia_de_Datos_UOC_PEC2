bright orange-red ball in sky;2002-03-02 20:20:00;approx.3 min.;bright orange-red ball in sky glowing,red-orange sphere,appearing as though aproaching me, at a very slow speed. It appeared to increase in size as it got nearer.  It appeared to have a light shaft emitting from either side shooting downward.  Then it stopped motion, and was motionless, and sent a sharp spear-like beam of red-orange light below it toward the earth.  It hung there for a couple of seconds, and then moved to the South ( left ) a short distance, dimmed and brightened, moved a short distance further South, then stopped, and then disappeared.  I contacted the U.S. AirBase at Malmstrom, Great Falls,MT. and they told me there were no planes or weather balloons in the air at the time. There was no sound from the object in question.  Sky was clear, and there was no wind.;48.3711;-107.8436
