Strange triangular light sighting over Northern Montana;2001-07-13 23:00:00;15-20 Min.;Strange triangular light sighting over Northern Montana As a musician/singer, I had been performing the day before at the VFW club in Malta. The ranch where I was a guest was 30 miles away. So the following evening the 18 yr. old son of my hosts drove me into town to pick up my PA equip. in his truck. Going back to the ranch we had to travel quite slow as these are gravel roads through thousands of acres of cattle/wheat/ect. and  my equip. could be damaged. There were no lights anywhere for miles other than the headlights.  As we came up a foothill rize, I saw 3 bright lights in the northern sky. I pointed them out to the young man and he freaked. Wow!!! he said My good buddy and I saw lights like these last winter coming home from football practice We stoppe the truck, turned off the headlights and watched these 3 lights in the form of a triangle move through the sky from west to east... then stationary...then move. When suddenly the lights separated into a line and quickly headed into the handle of the little dipper and each one moved into the exact star pattern and never moved again. We watched for quite some time before heading back to the ranch. This ranch is about 20 miles south of the Canadian border on the highline. This is only the most recent sighting for me. I've seen 4 before this occasion beginning in 1965 (with many witnesses) over Billings,Mt. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));48.3711;-107.8436
