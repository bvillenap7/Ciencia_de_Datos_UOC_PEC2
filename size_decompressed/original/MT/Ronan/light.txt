I looked to the east and saw a bright light.  My husband and I thought it was a star but realized there was nothing that should be that bright in the sky.  We watched it for a little while then we looked away.  My husband thought that it was getting brighter.  About 3 minuets later I looked back up and caught it fade to nothing.  We are not sure if something spectacular happened in space or what. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));47.5544;-114.1075
