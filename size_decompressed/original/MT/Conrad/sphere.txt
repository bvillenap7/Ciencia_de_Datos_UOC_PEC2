It appeared to be almost at a complete stop, moving extremely slowly.  We took three pictures.   When the object was zoomed in on the camera red, green and yellow lights were seen spinning, such as a stoplight spinning.  When the pictures were taken the lights did not show up on the display.  The object began moving at a greater speed, so we decided to attempt to follow it in our vehicle.  By this time it was moving so fast we could no longer keep up with it and lost sight of it.  When it disappeared it was travelling northwest, towards Valier, Montana. 4 other people saw it also. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the photo is of a high-altitude contrail, although the source of the report disagrees.  PD));48.1797;-111.9377
