Next, I looked at the other pictures I'd taken of that barn at the same time, like 4 of them, and there is nothing in any of those, either. Nothing on my lens, either. I don't know how close it was, as it was in the sky, there is nothing in many miles of this barn in the direction I was taking the picture, I even went out the  next day and went around that barn and looked at the background, nothing! It could have been many miles away from that barn, too. It resembles nothing I recognize, no plane, etc. I can send the picture if you'd like it. I am just amazed that it is in that photo! Thanks, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the photograph, and the object appears to us possibly to be a pheasant in flight.  Just a guess on our part.  PD));48.0338;-111.7527
