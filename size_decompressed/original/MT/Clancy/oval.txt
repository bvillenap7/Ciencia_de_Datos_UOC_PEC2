Clear sequence of 5 photos captures 2 UFOs approaching our camera!  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible white birds?  PD));2015-11-04 12:00:00;6 seconds;Clear sequence of 5 photos captures 2 UFOs approaching our camera! A series of 20 photographs were captured by a Reconnyx Hyperfire 900 series camera as a result of a 21 months (and ongoing) UFO/ET Contact research project.  The first 5 photos in this series recorded the direct approach of 2 UFOs to the east-facing camera from an unknown distance.  Photo M 5/20, obtained 6 seconds after the series of photos was triggered, reveals a clear photo of a UFO.  Neither UFO is seen in photo number 6, recorded approximately 1 second later.  I feel that this series of photos proves beyond a shadow of doubt that UFOs are real.  The next phase of this project will be aimed at clarifying to whom this UFO belongs, i.e. was this UFO of human or of ET (Star Visitor) origin. If this UFO was of Star Visitor origin, can we make Contact with them?  We are going to try!

However, we note that the source of the report is actively involved in the field of UFO research.  PD));46.4657;-111.9854
