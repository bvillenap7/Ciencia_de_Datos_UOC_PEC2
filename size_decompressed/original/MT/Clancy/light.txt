It was July 4th at about 7:30pm.  In Clancy Mt.  The sun had gone behind the mountain, but it was still light out.  I was playing Frisbee with a life long family friend of my father. He tossed me the Frisbee  and said, I'll be back.  I'm going to go grab an o'douls. I missed the catch and turned to grab it down the hill and my dog tried to get it first. As I turned back around facing to the west I saw a brilliant bright white ball of light fixed above the pine trees.  I remember my dog out of my peripheral to the right of me. He was wincing!  All I could think is do not blink and to explain it best would be shock and awe!  My dad's friend came out the door and said my name .....You still out here?  There was no zipping off or noise or fading out or flashing.  It was just gone as I remember!  I tried to say hey did u see it but I had an overwhelming feeling that he didn't and I shouldn't say any more.  I then just went inside and sat in my room with my thoughts racing. I did try to tell all my family and many friends that night and throughout the years and believe many of them believe me. Today, I have the memory still as vivid as it was in 1995.  The only thing  that has changed in the years since is I am now old enough to realize that he said you still out here?  I believe now that it was a time laps and that I was in direct contact. Of course with no memory during this encounter.   My dog was never the same nor have I been.  I tell this story still to this day to every new person I spend any time with.  It's true and is a part of who I am and always will be.   Thank you for your time.;46.4657;-111.9854
