Movement pattern was up, down, then to my right.  after 5-10 minutes objject was gone. Distance unknown, looked about size of my thumbnail at arm's length. The object was saucer shaped with a bright light blinking from the lower part of the craft.  It was a white light, very bright, partially illuminating the rest of the craft.  it blinked in a cadence varying from one to five beats.  There was no noticable pattern to the cadence.The cadence seemed to speed up when the craft was moving.  The craft moved from up to down then to the right, not very far, and repeated the process.  I was waliking my dogs.  They pulled me out of view of the object for a minute when I returned to my original sight, it was gone.;47.7923;-114.3042
