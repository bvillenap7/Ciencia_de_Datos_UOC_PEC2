Unidentifiable flying craft in Newfoundland;2012-07-23 22:46:00;3 minutes;Unidentifiable flying craft in Newfoundland Me and my girlfriend and her friend were walking trough town at 15 minutes to 11pm in our small town in Newfoundland, Canada. At about 10:47pm on july 23rd we were approximately 100 feet east of the town multipurpose court. At that point my girlfriend's friend pointed toward the far shore pointing to an object flying through sky and a very slow speed. It appeared to be a square shape or possibly rectangular, it had four static red lights, four flashing light blue or white lights and extremely powerful headlights that shone approximately 10 times the length of the object. Shining in the direction it was heading. It was flying for about 3 minutes within our view at which point it disappear behind the hill that borders the inland part of our community.   I am unable to post a photo is a rough drawing of what we seen as the undercarriage of the craft, 3 headlights 4 red solid color lights, the yellow spots represent the 4 flashing lights.
