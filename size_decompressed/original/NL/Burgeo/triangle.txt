Silent triangle craft floating over Burgeo, Newfoundland, Canada.;2009-08-20 23:00:00;1 minute;Silent triangle craft floating over Burgeo, Newfoundland, Canada. A completely silent triangle craft floated across the sky as we were star gazing.   We only noticed the craft's faint outline as it blocked out the stars as it crossed the sky.  If it wasn't 23:00 and a flat terrain for miles, I would have thought it was a low flying hang glider.;47.6;-57.6333
