At first it was stationary and appeared to be red white and green.  We called our neighbors and they came.  One was a professional photographer.  We have three photos which I can send. The sky was clear with no clouds and many stars in the distant background.  The photos show that the object was darting and changing color at a very rapid rate.  We are all professionals and have never encountered anything that looked like this. It appeared at the exact same time on the 9th.  However it got cloudy and we could not see it any more. I would be glad to send you copies of the photos. What is your e-mail address for pictures?;47.7641;-53.2208
