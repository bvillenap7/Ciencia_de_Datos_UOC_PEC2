Black, Tri-lobal object in sky.;1985-06-15 18:00:00;several minutes;Black, Tri-lobal object in sky. It was a clear evening as I walked to my friends house to retrieve my bike I had earlier left there.  As I was walking down the street, I happened to look up in the sky and I noticed a black, tri-lobal object in the sky.  It didn't move and I glanced around to see if anyone else was observing the same thing.  I looked up again and it was still in the same position.  I went into my friends house and told him about it but when we went to his living room window, it was gone.  I should point out that I was about 10 yrs old at the time.;48.8167;-56.8702
