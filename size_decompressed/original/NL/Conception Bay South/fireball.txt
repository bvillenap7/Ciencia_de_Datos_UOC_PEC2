Cluster of moving stars and orange 'fireballs';2017-01-07 21:50:00;5 minutes;Cluster of moving stars and orange 'fireballs.' When I first walked outside I poked my head around the corner to see the stars on January 7 I noticed this wild grouping of really bright lights like stars.  They were all twinkling. I thought to myself....what group of stars it that!!!  So bright and so many!!   The cluster sparkled and moved away into the distance.   Right after, a number of fireballs orange orbs began to move through the sky.  There was probably 8 or 9 in total.  They also moved through the sky and into the distance.   A strange and beautiful sight.;47.50318;-52.9741
