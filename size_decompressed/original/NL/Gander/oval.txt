Grey silhouette moving very fast with a single orange light;2012-06-24 00:00:00;4 minutes;Grey silhouette moving very fast with a single orange light The object started out as a constant bright white light travelling through the clear night sky.  We believed at this point that it was the International Space Station since it seemed to be moving at about the same speed.  Before the object was directly overhead it faded out like when viewing satellites. Once it was directly overhead it became brighter and we could see a dark grey oval silhouette with a single orange light on the back.  It kept moving until it was out of site. It was hard to gage the actual size but it seemed big.  There was no sound and there were no other lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be flawed.
