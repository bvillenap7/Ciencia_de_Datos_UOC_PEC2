I am writing this for my son. He took my camera outside one evening just outside our home, there was a nice sunset and I guess he wanted to get some pictures of it.I was setting inside when I heard him coming in all excited about somthing he had got a picture of. He was lucky to get a pic of it because he was taking random pics in a sort of panoramic view and when he was done, he started looking at them through the lcd display and thats when he noticed it. He looked all around but could not see the object any more. I am submitting the photos.I took a look at it and it is very strange.When I zoomed in and cropped the picture, and it seemd you can see some sort of faces in it. Hope to here some imput about this strange object.;48.9171;-57.7979
