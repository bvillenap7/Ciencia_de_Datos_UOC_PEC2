UFO Newfoundland;2013-08-02 03:30:00;2 minutes;ufo Newfoundland At about 3:30am in the early morning hours of Aug 2.  While having a cigarette and looking at the stars  on a clear night i observed a ball of light moving speraticly across the sky i watched it move from where i first seen the object until it had moved across the horizion and out of my view just seconds later two jets appered which were easily distinguishable compaired to the object as i could clearly see flashing red lights and hear the jet engines.  The jets appered to be following the objects flight path which only made me question what the object must have been for government to scramble jets to follow or intercept the craft. I know others had to have seen this as the sky was so clear.  Please believe this is no hoax, please observe the skys over Newfoundland Canada.;47.7095;-53.2933
