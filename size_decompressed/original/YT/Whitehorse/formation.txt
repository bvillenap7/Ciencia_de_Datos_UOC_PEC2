Objects hide in odd-looking sky, not visible with the naked eye.;2006-08-03 23:00:00;Unknown;Objects hide in odd-looking sky, not visible with the naked eye. I was at the Casaloma bar singing on August 3, 2006.  When I was outside I noticed the sky looked very strange that night.  The sun was setting and the sky had strange, wavy lines streaking across it. One area in particular, a patch in the north end of the sky looked as though it was made of water or heat waves.  It's very hard to describe but it was odd-looking to me.  I noticed chemtrails earlier that day and thought maybe those odd wavy, I don't know if you can even call them clouds, streaks across the sky could be caused by whatever they're spraying up there.  I took some pictures of the sky with my digital camera.  After downloading them onto my computer I noticed that the waves that I saw with my eyes were not visible on the photo, however, the northern spot where the waves were the most concentrated, there are four round objects that appear to be in formation. I took a few photos of that area and they are visible in each one. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));60.718;-135.0475
