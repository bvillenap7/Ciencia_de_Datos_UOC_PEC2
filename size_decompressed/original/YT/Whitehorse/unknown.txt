red/green light object flashing/hovering in sky for 40 minutes/bright circular light below/amber lights flashing in another direction;2008-11-07 01:15:00;40 minutes;red/green light object flashing/hovering in sky for 40 minutes/bright circular light below/amber lights flashing in another direction I reside in the Yukon, 40 minutes outside of Whitehorse. On November 7th when I was outside admiring the northern lights, I noticed a series of unusual green/red/blue lights hovering over the lake. I assumed nothing but an airplane, but then an extremely bright light flashed from halfway between the lake and below the other flashing object. Marsh Lake is sparsely inhabited and I have never seen such a light, or formation. After five minutes the bright light disappeared, but the object flying above continued hovering for over half an hour. It slowly faded away, then an amber light formation appeared in another direction. I would just like a second, professional opinion on this. I did record samples on video for my own record.
