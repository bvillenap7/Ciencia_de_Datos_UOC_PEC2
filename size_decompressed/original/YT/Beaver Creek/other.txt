Strange Solid Black line in the sky, horizon to horizon, broad daylight;2007-08-01 11:00:00;10 minutes;Strange Solid Black line in the sky, horizon to horizon, broad daylight on august 1st 2007 at approximately 11 am in the morning, while driving on the alaska highway near lake creek campground my co worker and i noticed a thin black line going from horizon to horizon ending at pickhandle mountain.  we guessed that this black line in the sky was at about 30, 000 feet up, going north to south.  We estimate this height because right after that we noticed a jet coming into sight and following the exact path of this strange black line. The jet continued along the line then changed direction and went due north towards alaska.  The black line dissipayed about ten minutes after we originally noticed it.  My coworker and i have been working this highway for 20 years and have never seen such a thing before.  This black line was something strange that we have never before seen in broad daylight.  We are just inquring about this as we have never seen anything like it before.  EVER.  Something about this was very weird.;62.3844;-140.8872
