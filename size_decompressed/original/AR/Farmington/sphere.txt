NO other lights. moving horizontally from south to north 200 ft above ground September 3, 2012  Sitting on my back patio tonight.  Neighbors had been shooting fireworks in celebration of Labor Day holiday.  Time was 9:50pm.  Orange/amber orb appeared from nowhere approximately 200 ft. vertical above my backyard.  I live in a very populated neighborhood however, lots of farmland surrounding area.  I first thought this was some sort of remnant from a firework and it appeared to be “on fire”.  It was moving very, very slowly from the southeast sky toward the northern sky.  It literally stopped overhead and hovered for approximately 1 minute and then continued on this northern direction, remaining perfectly horizontal to the ground at the same altitude it first approached.  As I watched it glide across the sky, totally without sound, I kept trying to process what this could be.  I even thought someone must have an awesome remote control toy, until it disappeared in the distance.  During its flight, it would get brighter, then dimmer but was absolutely NOT an airplane or h! elicopter and no other lights or colors----just the steady glowing orange/amber color.  I can only seem to describe it as what the sun against the night sky would look like, only much smaller form.  As I was trying to explain this, another one appeared in the exact location as the first and mimicked the flight pattern exactly as the first, just as the first was almost out of sight range.  I am not panicked about this….just extremely curious.  Another side note, temperatures outside 80 degrees and zero wind.  I am a very sane person…….this was VERY odd.;36.0429;-94.2553
