Random flashes in the sky;2015-09-27 20:00:00;15 minutes;Random flashes in the sky On September 27, 2015, My friend and I were approximately 12 miles south of Yellville, Arkansas off Hwy 14, near the Buffalo River.  This was the night of the blood moon.  As we were outside watching the lunar eclipse, my friend was looking up at the stars.  He got my attention and told me to look at what he was seeing.  I looked over to see what he was talking about and I notice a flash in the sky.  If say 90 degree is straight up, then the flash out be about say 80 degree point sitting stationary in the sky.  This flash seems to be coming from a long distance.  So as we are watching, the flash would happen approximately 30 or so seconds.  The flash would either be a slow fade in, then slow fade out or would be a quick, high intensity flash.  This seemed to be random with no pattern.  Continued in one spot for about 15 minutes and then the flash would be in another spot, and then another spot, until it was completely gone.  I am aware what a high altitude j! et and a satellite crossing the sky looks like.  Nothing to my knowledge would stay stationary for this period of time.  The next morning we talked about it to make sure we had both seen the same thing;36.225;-92.7316
