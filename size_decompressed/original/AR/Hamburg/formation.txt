I walked outside about midnight and casually looked up in the sky.  At that exact moment I saw what appeared to be an aircraft with no sound and no lights moving west to east.  It’s terribly hard to explain exactly what it looked like, but the best description I can come up with is that it resembled a sting ray.  It seemed low in the sky considering the amount of area it took up, but was completely silent and looked almost as if it had really dim lights illuminating the shape of the craft. It moved faster than a airplane, but slower than a shooting star.  I called my 13 yr old son outside to tell him what I saw, and we then observed 10-12 more over the next hour and a half.  They all moved about the same speed, but came from different directions and different altitudes.  The weirdest thing was that they seem to appear directly after we would see a volley of shooting stars.  My son said they looked like 4 stars moving together across the sky.  The kicker is that they weren’t illuminated, but they seemed to be either reflecting light or they were glowing very faintly.  Very strange.;33.2083;-91.8044
