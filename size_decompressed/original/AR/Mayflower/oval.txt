At first sight I thought it was a light from a tower, but it was a bit peculiar since I had not seen it in the area previously.  We watched it for about 20 minutes.   While we watched, the light appeared to very slowly ascend a noticeable distance.  The light resembled a stoplight with a slight hourglass shape.  It did not make any sudden movements and no noise could be heard due to fireworks.  The object suddenly disappeared as if someone had turned out the light.  We are located within thirty miles of a military base/camp.   We were not scared...only curious. We have had multiple friends share their sightings of similar lighted objects in the last few months.;34.9655;-92.4022
