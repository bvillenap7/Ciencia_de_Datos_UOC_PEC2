There were a string of disappearing lights.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-10 21:30:00;30 min;There were a string of disappearing lights My wife and I were sitting on the back porch when we both noticed what we thought were an odd group of stars in the northern sky. After we both commented on the cluster... one by one they slowly started to move and faded out. They were the same intensity of the stars that make up the lyra constellation. One by one they move from our field of vision in front of us to the right and faded away. We looked at each other in a little dismay. Then slowly from the tree line in front of us in the north by west sky... one light at a time rose... and then dissapeared. No flashing.. like plane lights just solid light rising then dissapeared in the middle of the sky. The event started at approx 21:30 and ended around 22:05. We estimated 25 to 30.;34.9655;-92.4022
