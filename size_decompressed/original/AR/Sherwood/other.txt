It was about the size of a mini-van.  It was an oblong light.  It was not shining, but rather glowing.  It did not really light up the area around it.  It was below tree top level. I happened to look out the window, and I saw a yellow, glowing, light.  It was not shining, but glowing. It did not cast light on the surrounding objects.  It was about 100-120 feet away, hovering above a house.  It was barely moveing to my right, and behind a tree.  I saw the entire craft for only a minute, the rest of the time I saw the light inbetween the branches of the tree.  I looked at my clock.  It was 11:10.  I looked at it with binoculars, but could not make out any detail.  I thought about waking my mom, but she had taken some back medication, and was in too deep a sleep.  I was about to get my camera, and run out to the craft, but I then remebered watching a show on UFO.  The people that got too close to UFO would have there electronic equiptment shut down.  And, people that got too close would recieve radiation poisoning, or if they were really unfortunate, get abducted.  I watched it for 20 more minutes, then, the light was gone.  I watched that area for 20 more minutes, but I did not see it.  I finally went outside, but it was gone.;34.8775;-92.2265
Crazy UFO sightings.;2013-10-02 20:00:00;2 hours;Crazy UFO sightings. I was riding home from church, on highway 67, and 3 white-ish yellow-ish orbs hover horizontally.  The one on the right is blinking red. I video it, since I love these things.  I take the loop to get on Brooksword and I see 2 flashing red orbs and one right above me.  It disappeared as soon as I went under it. I pull up in my driveway, to see 6 red flashing orbs. (Too high for a cell tower)  I wait 30 minutes after telling my friends.  And I go outside to see them still there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.8775;-92.2265
