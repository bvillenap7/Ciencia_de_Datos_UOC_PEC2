I saw three lights (dim, like distant stars) in a triangular formation. I watched them pass from east of overhead to the southwest horizon. They did not burn up, leave a trail, or anything meteors usually do. I'm a federal employee.  I tried to convince myself that these were simply meteors, but the fact that they moved horizontally without losing any apparent altitude, combined with the duration of time I witnessed these lights, as well as the unchanging distance between all three lights throughout the event, tells me that these could not have been meteors.  The odds of THREE meteors having the same speed, and direction in a formation that makes a perfect triangle, at the exact same time... God, that's got to be one hell of an unlikely event. It was also completely silent.;34.8775;-92.2265
