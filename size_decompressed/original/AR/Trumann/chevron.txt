Black chevron with at least 5 amber lights seen on Hwy. 63N  at  8 pm near Trumann, Arkansas;2006-12-10 20:00:00;30 seconds;Black chevron with at least 5 amber lights seen on Hwy. 63N  at  8 pm near Trumann, Arkansas On the evening of 12/10/06 at approximately 8 pm,  while riding in a church bus from Memphis, TN to Jonesboro, AR on highway 63N, I noticed a large amber light in the northwest sky.  At first, I thought what I was seeing was a star or planet,  but then it started getting closer.  I pointed out the light to my husband. The light seemed to parallel the highway traveling basically southeast.  Since I was seated by a window, I had a brief view as it passed by.  It was a  black chevron with at least 5 amber lights. I have no idea of how to judge the altitude, but it looked to be a large craft.  As far as I know, I am the only passenger to see the chevron, but my husband witnessed the light as it was approaching.  My background is education.;35.5882;-90.562
