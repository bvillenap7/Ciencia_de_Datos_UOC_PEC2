It had 3 lights in each corner. In one corner it was the brightest and just like a regular light, and in the other corners it was different colors. When it flew over highway 65 the other two lights went out so it was just one light and it started to look like a star. It flew too fast to be an airplane and it basically disappeared after it flew over the highway.;35.2277;-92.3572999999999
