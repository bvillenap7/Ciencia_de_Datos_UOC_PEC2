I work the night shift. I had just left work and was on my way home.  I was just talking on the phone and then all of a sudden this white, slightly glowing giant boomerang-like thing starts flying toward my driver side window.  But it wasn't just flying.  It was like twisting at me. I freak out and lduck by moving to the far right side of my seat and slump down.  There was no way in the world it was a bird, a bat, or a piece of trash.  There were no cars near me, nor did I pass any.   Also, there wasn't any light near where it appeared from.  This is how I knew it was glowing.  It didn't make a noise when it went by. It either had to go straight over the top of my car, or go straight up in the air.  Well, or disappear...;35.2277;-92.3572999999999
