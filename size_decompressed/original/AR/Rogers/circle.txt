Fireball over Rogers;2012-05-25 22:30:00;About 2 minutes;Fireball over Rogers I was sitting on the patio when I observed a bright object flying low coming over the tree line from the east, it was very slow moving.  At first I thought it was a helicopter with bright lights on, but then realized there was no noise.  It stopped and paused for about 20 seconds, i could then see that it was round in shape with the upper being outlined in red and the rest resembled a fireball.  It then changed direction 90 degrees to the north and picked up speed as it gained altitude. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
