Orange, oval objects seen over Rogers, Arkansas;2012-07-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;Orange, oval objects seen over Rogers, Arkansas While watching neighborhood fireworks in my back yard, I noticed an orange oval object in the sky heading north.  It was about a mile up, and was just east of my house.  There was no sound coming from the object nor were the lights blinking.   About a minute later, I saw another one coming almost directly over my house.  Again, it was silent and no lights were blinking.  It was heading north as well.   It got past my house about 1/2 mile and disappeared in the sky. I am a 61-year old professional woman who is not on any medication or alcohol.;36.3237067961165;-94.137577669903
