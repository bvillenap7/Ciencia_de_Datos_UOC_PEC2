My son and I stopped to gaze at the full moon when this ridged kite like object crossed in front of the moon. It made no sound, no running lights. Speed slower than a glider. If object had stopped dead center of the moon the outer wings would not be visible by a few feet. My guess was 1/4 mile away.  It's left side was tipped high in the air. The craft looked prehistoric as if you placed two alligators head to head.  It had rough curly ringlets on leading edge, running the length of the wings a few feet apart. Color was dark gray. The heading was NE towards Rogers air port approx. three miles.  This was not a bat, owl or a living creature. Unfortunately my 14 year old was looking elsewhere.  Reaction: Total befuddlement and astonishment. First words: Oh my God, did you see that?;36.3237067961165;-94.137577669903
