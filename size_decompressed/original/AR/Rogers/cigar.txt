I was finishing up a brick mail box, while my boss and an other laborer went to get our lunch, and there was a pretty big cumulous cloud to the north east of our construction sight, I was worried about rain messing up our brick work. The cloud was split, and from the most eastern cloud side came, from behind or within I'm really not sure, a dull, metallic, cigar shaped object, it was moving at a low rate of speed, slower than that of any commercial, or military aircraft I have observed, nor did it resemble, it crossed the gap in the clouds,left my view behind or into the cloud formation, I really didn't think much of it at this point, but it got me thinking, when the same object came back out and followed its same path back into or behind the cloud formation. I kept watching to see if it was going to come back into view, but it never did. I have never seen anything like it before or since. I am an opend minded individuale, seeing is believing, this was some years ago, I have told a few friends, my mother, and two brothers about this, an would of reported it to you guys sooner, but I didn't know a ufo center existed until tonight. There was no noise that I could associate with the object, and there was no chemtrails often seen behind commercial airlines. The skys were clear besides a few cloud formations. I was sober and on the job at the time this happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.3237067961165;-94.137577669903
