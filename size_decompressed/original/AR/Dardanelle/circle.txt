I saw a large white light zip not only across the sky, but angled downwards at high speeds.;2017-12-09 03:05:00;2 seconds;I was driving down the highway, taking a friend home, when out of the corner of my eye, looking through the windshield, I saw a large white light zip not only across the sky, but angled downwards at high speeds, had I blinked I would have missed it but the size in comparison to the rest of the scenery I was seeing, it was like half the size of a dime on my windshield if that makes sense.  The ufo did not follow the curvature of the earth, and if it did touch down I would guess it was within 25 miles of my location.   I couldn't make out the shape of it but the light was circular, with a small trail behind it, but not like a meteor. It was too big to be an asteroid or a meteor, and to fast to be anything from earth.  Where I live I see a lot of commercial airlines fly overhead at night, but the light that a commercial plane gives off pales in comparison to the light of this ufo.   I was astounded and my friend in the passenger seat saw it also, he said he was able to see a! shape within the light, but it went by so quickly, it was hard to make out an exact shape.
