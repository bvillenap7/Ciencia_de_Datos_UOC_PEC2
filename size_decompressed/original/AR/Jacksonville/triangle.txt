Triangular shape, A triangular shaped object, first seen at 25-30 miles away, first assumed to be a forest fire or C-130 crash. Very bright at this distance, seemed to lessen in intensity the nearer we got. Still, bright enough for us to assume it was a monstrous fire ( from C-130 Crash, forest fire). Nearing the craft, it took on this triangular shape, perfect in symmetry, and eac corner of the triangle was luminious, a bright amber glow. These amber lights seemed to emit into alternating shapes, from straight, to something like wings of an insect. A clear night, could see the stars surrounding the craft. No sound hovered entirely motionless soundless, except for very light humming. We left at my dad's urgency!! We knew he meant business when he told my mother to drive away!
