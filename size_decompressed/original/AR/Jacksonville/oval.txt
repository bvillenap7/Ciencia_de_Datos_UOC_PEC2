Light appearing behind satellite, in front of it and then disappearing on 4th of July;2019-07-04 22:15:00;5 seconds;light appearing behind satellite, in front of it and then disappearing on 4th of July I live in a pretty old somewhat historic area with very old large trees around my property in every direction that block any distant views. It was 4th of July here in the united states. My boyfriend and I had decided to go outside to see if we could see any fireworks at around 9:15pm central time, we witnessed a few fireworks of a local neighbor & were able to see part of the finale at the local shooting & sports complex that is adjacent to my house several blocks north of my house. Those were the last viewable fireworks we saw from my house, you could still hear the fireworks from several directions but we were not able to see them with all the very large trees surrounding the area. We continued to stay outside, we put a blanket in the back of my boyfriends trailer, both of us having back problems decided to just lay in it and look at the stars & listen to the radio, my boyfriend went inside for a cigarette and i laying there on my back in the trailer looki! ng directly up above me see a slow moving satellite just passing by then out of nowhere i see a gold colored oval shaped o light appear a bit of a distance behind the satellite moving at the same speed trailing it for a brief moment as if it was following it. then the light went out then it reappeared a good distance in front of the satellite & sat there like it was waiting for it to catch up as if it was inspecting it. the light went out again, then came back on a short distance ahead of where it previously was then it disappeared & zoomed off instantly. The sattelite and the object both went south. My boyfriend came back outside & I had told him what I had seen. we stayed outside until about 11pm, the object was not seen again, the satellite had floated off and no more fireworks were seen;34.919;-92.1419
