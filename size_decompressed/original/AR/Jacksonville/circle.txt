big bright object rising off the ground.;2003-01-17 00:00:00;1 min;big bright object rising off the ground. It was at the Little Rock Air Force Base where I was living at the time. I was going home at about 3am from visiting with my sister. On the base the have an elementery school. Just past the school there is a bunch of trees. I was almost to the school and happened to look up and notice some really big orange red object rising to the sky. At first I thought that is could be a very big hot air balloon or something and I kept looking at it but it was just too big to be anything else. I notice that it looked as if it were over the flight line of the base. and that there were no plains flying. It was still rising when I started to passes the trees and then i couldn't see around the trees so I sped up, it is a very short line of trees and couldn't have taken longer that 10 sec to pass them but by the time I got around them the object was gone. A little confused by what I saw, I went home to tell my husband what I saw, so he made a few phone calls and no one knew what I was talking about. I never actually got over it and I always thought what if? Untill I was watching one of the ufo shows where they were showing pictures of sighted ufo's and all the sudden the object I had seen appeared on tv. A little stunned I finally realized I really did see something wierd. It has taking me this long to report because I was affraid that the military would come after me and my husband feared it also. But they will i hope just think of this as being something no one will listen and I hope they ignore it. But since seeing that I now know that the military is involved some how weather it be the are hiding special aircraft or that they have come in contact with other life forms and have been in contact for a long time.;34.919;-92.1419
