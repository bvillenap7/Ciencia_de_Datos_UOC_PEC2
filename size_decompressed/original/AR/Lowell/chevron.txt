V-Shaped object passing over Lowell, Arkansas, with no sound or lights.;2007-11-16 21:30:00;00:15 Seconds;V-Shaped object passing over Lowell Arkansas with no sound or lights. It was a clear night with no clouds, although cold, I thought I would go outside for a smoke. Over the past 2 weeks my brother and I had been trying to find a comet that is supposedly viewable in the Northeast sky. While having my smoke, I made a phone call to a friend. After only 2 to 5 seconds of saying hello, I looked up and saw the following:  One “V-Shaped” object heading due south at a slow speed. The object made no sound and had no lights. The object was brownish in color and dark. Although the object was dark, it was clearly offset from the clear night sky. After passing over the crest of the houses roof, I quickly ran to the street to see where it went. It was then that the object’s shape became more visible due to the distant city lights. After continuing on its south direction a few more seconds, the object was no longer visible to me. Over the next hour, there was an increase in high and low flying identifiable flying objects in the area - Aircrafts  After much debate with another friend this morning, I decided to notify local police to report my experience. They had no information on what it could have been and no records of any other phone calls explaining the event.;36.2519;-94.1344
