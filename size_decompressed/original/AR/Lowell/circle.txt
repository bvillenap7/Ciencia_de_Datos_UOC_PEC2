Flashing red and green stationary object over NWA.;2015-05-27 23:00:00;23:30;Flashing red and green stationary object over NWA. Went outside to see if i could see any stars and noticed high in the a stationary object that was blinking red and green lights.  I called my husband and he saw it to he didn't think it was an airplane or satellite since it seemed to be stationary.   I asked him to get the video camera and I was able to capture a couple of seconds before it sped away! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
