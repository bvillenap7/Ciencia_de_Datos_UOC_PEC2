It was a orange ball several thousand feet in the sky.;1973-05-05 03:00:00;30 seconds;It was a orange ball several thousand feet in the sky. We were coming back from fishing, when we came to a farm.  I looked south out my window and I said dad what's that!!  It was a big orange ball in the sky.  I dont know maybe several thousand feet in the sky.   My dad said: I don't know what it is!   At that time a group of trees in the field.  Dad said we'll stop and look when we get past these trees.   We stopped but the orange ball was gone! I didn't see it speed away but it was not there anymore!   At the time of the sighting there was a comet you could see in the sky.  I personally don't believe in aliens from outer space but I don't have an idea what it was!    Thanks for listening! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
