Bright cigar shaped light on video in the middle of the woods in south Arkansas;2012-08-02 03:00:00;8 seconds;Bright cigar shaped light on video in the middle of the woods in south Arkansas Ok Im doing this off of my phone because i do not own a computer. Me and 5 other friends were celebrating A's birthday at S's  camp in the woods.  We got bored and decided to go for a ride. We got down the dirt road a little way when E said that he wanted to ride on top of the car.  So we stopped and he got out and climbed on top.  I pulled out my camera on my phone and started filming him as we started driving down the road with him holding the luggage bar on top. I took 5 or 6 videos of him riding on The car.  The max video time limit on my phone was like 1 minute something. We get back to the camp later that night and i start watching the videos when i noticed something strange. (Keep in mind that no one saw anything in the sky even E who was riding on the car  Although he appears to notice it in the video)   At the very beginning of the video i point the camera towards the road to show how fast we are going and you can see a bright neon green light in the distance on the left side of the road. I point the camera back to E on the car, then back towards the road and the green light is now a cigar shape and is much closer.  It's on the right side of the road and is bigger and brighter. If you stop the video about 5 seconds in you can see the reflection on The car and it looks like three green lights. All of the people who were there will testify that I did not tamper with this video in any way. And this is not a joke or a hoax. Im not saying it was an alien space ship, but i cant identify this strange light.;33.5344;-92.5214
