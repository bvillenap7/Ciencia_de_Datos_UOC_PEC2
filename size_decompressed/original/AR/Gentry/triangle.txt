Silent triangle;2006-12-12 03:35:00;4-7 mins;Silent triangle Last night at 3:31 am I noticed 3 bright lights outside in the sky. These  lights were arranged in a triangle shape. 2 of the lights were white or possible a pale yellow in color then one bottom light was red. Gentry is a very rural area, with no traffic or other light disturbances.. I went outside and the lights zipped across the sky, from left to right, almost like a shooting star sideways with NO SOUND! Then it paused on the right side of the sky, then immediately zipped back across the sky to the right. This time the red light was on the top not the bottom. It was so dark that I could barely see the actual craft, so I am going by the shape and light pattern as to the EXACT shape. It was matte black, not shiny. This was NOT a typical airplane. It was so fast zipping across the sky and NOT a sound... Made a sideways N zig zag pattern, then disappeared completely into the night sky.;36.2598;-94.472
Gentry, AR   orange three spots triangle;2007-08-13 22:20:00;60 seconds;Gentry, AR   orange three spots triangle I saw three orange lights in the shape of a triangle that didn't blink.  The bottom right hand spot in the triangle was the brightest.  The left bottom spot was next brightest and the top spot was the dimmest.  It moved across the sky North to Northeast (we were watching for the meteor shower) at the speed of a moving airplane.. a bit more purposeful like a satellite?  It always kept its form but as it moved NE it became dimmer and smaller.  My son saw a halo around it.  I didn't see the halo, but my son is mildly near sighted. He saw the three lights too and kept telling me to get my camera, but my camera isn't good enough to catch what we saw and I didn't want to take my eyes off of it.  Both of us are disturbed.  Any knowledge is welcome. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides only e-address.  PD));36.2598;-94.472
