16+ solid white lights moving along same trajectory and all perfectly evenly spaced .  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-24 17:30:00;5 minutes;16+ solid white lights moving along same trajectory and all perfectly evenly spaced . Time of the event was somewhere between 9pm and 10pm. I stepped out back to let the dogs out during which time I always like to look at the night sky to catch a shooting star or the occasional satellite maybe. After a few minutes for my eyes to adjust to the night sky I noticed what appeared to be a satellite coming across the night sky in the area of the Pleiades constellation and moving directly toward Orion's belt and continuing in a straight line across the sky. There were several aircraft in view to get a fair judgement of altitude and speed. It moved exactly as a satellite however, it was only visible to the eye as a solid white light. No strobe or pulse and I can't recall seeing satellites that did not have a red light as well. Strange I thought. Once it was nearing out of sight I noticed another white light traveling about 5 seconds behind the first and moving along the exact same path. Again, strange but then came a third and fourth...I counted 16 i! n total while I was outside but I did not stay until it was over so I don't know the actual number of lights in total. All the lights moved along the exact same path and appeared to be spaced out perfectly evenly.;36.4690564102564;-94.276741025641
