The eve;2003-10-27 20:30:00;30 minute;On October 27, 2003 was heading home from seeing friends in Hot Springs Village which is 8 miles Northeast of Hot Springs, AR.  The evening was beautifully clear, with every star showing.  I was travelling on Fresno Rd going approximately Northwest towards the West Gate.  In a very desolate area above the tree tops was a Triangular shaped object that blocked out the stars but had 3 lights at each apices with a very intense red light approximately in the center of the craft.  I slowed down to approximately 5 mph to observe this craft, then pulled over to observe.  I noticed on the next hill ahead of me someone else was looking at it as well.  I rolled down my window and listened over the din of the idle of my truck as the craft slowly at a turtles pace glided in an approximately westerly direction.  There was a very low pitched hum which appeared to erratically cycle and coincided occasionally with the pulsing of the lights.  I turned on my radio to KVRE 92.9 FM, the Hot Springs Village Radio Station and there appeared to be no interference.  I then switched over to an AM station and got static and a weird cycling signal in the background.  I found another AM station and again the same wird signal was heard.  By this time the craft had crossed Fresno road behind the other vehicle on top of the hill.  As it had crossed over the red light in the center shot a beam down into the timber for several seconds, then it began to accelerate.  I continued to check my radio and the AM continued to appeared to be jammed while the FM station was not jammed.  By the time I got to west gate, the craft could not be fould to the east or west.
