Airplane type craft 2,500 - 4,000ft elevation yellow/white lights;2019-04-12 20:20:00;5-10 seconds;Airplane type craft 2,500 - 4,000ft elevation yellow/white lights Driving south on I-49 in southwestern Arkansas, between mile markers 20 and 10.  I always watch sky on drive home from work.  Using flight radar 24 app I watch for planes.  This craft came in at low altitude (compared to commercial flights in area).  It immediately caught my eye.  I was moving around to make sure it wasn't a reflection on windshield.  Craft came in with lights on.  West to east.  Came into my vision slowed down within 2-4 seconds.  Then, went at high rate of speed, turned lights off and disappeared.  The way it was moving was much different than a plane.  It was effortless. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and he sounded to us to be very serious, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));33.3032;-93.8977
