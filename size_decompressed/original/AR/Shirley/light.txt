My mother was driving, I was in the passenger seat up front, it was sometime in the afternoon and still light out.  We were headed toward town and shortly before yeilding coming from Porter Road by the Lute Mountain Road intersection, I saw two balls of yellow/orangish light in the sky next to each other.  They went to opposite horizons, 'bounced' back next to each other and seemed to dance around each other, before shooting back up and out of sight. This happened very fast.  I remember well having enough time to say, Mom! MOM! and she said, I see it!  And we had a few seconds left, silently staring at these things in disbelief.  They moved very quickly.   I also remember it being a clear day, and before the 4th of July, because I specifically remember watching fireworks thinking the whole time maybe that was it but nothing even remotely resembled these things, and there was no sound or the car we were in drowned out any sound there may have been.  I didn't want to check that they had a haze, but it may be worth mentioning they sort of glowed..  Like I said they were like balls of light. I was ten years old when this happened, my mother was just a stay at home mom.  But I remember that day very vividly and have always wanted a chance to tell someone experienced with these things in hopes of finding out exactly what those light things were. My father was in the air force, and his father in the navy..  When I told them this they said they must have been flares until I described the way they moved and how quickly..  Both swore flares do not behave that way. I did have two experiences since that definitely took me back to that day, but neither compared to this incident.
