I was looking out of a window to the West, for no particular reason, when I noticed a strange light.  I watched it for a couple of minutes, trying to decide if it was a star, plane, or what.  The light was a steady glow, white in color, and motionless.  I called my wife to come look and she told me that was the same light she had seen in the past and called me to come look, but I dismissed it as a plane or a nightwatcher light of a neighbor, without ever looking when she called.  I took binoculars outside, and looking through them, this object had a triangular shape, with lights going up one side and down the other.  None across bottom oftriangle. I came back inside, we talked about it, and when I looked again, it had dis- appeared.  We observed for perhaps 20 min., how long it had been there before I noticed it, I don't know.;34.9463999999999;-92.0321999999998
