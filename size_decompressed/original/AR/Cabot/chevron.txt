Two very large stationary crafts illuminating the sky above Arkansas.;2007-09-11 21:40:00;5-7 Minutes;Two very large stationary crafts illuminating the sky above Arkansas. While driving back from Jacksonville to Heber Springs, we were exiting Hwy 67/167 onto Hwy 5 at Cabot.  Just entering Hwy 5 we noticed two large strings of lights in the sky on the east side of the highway.  First thinking that they were C-130 aircraft from the airbase we pointed them out to our ten year old son.  We observed that the lights were stationary.  Closer observation showed to prove the craft much larger and much farther away than we first thought.  We took note of the lights remaining where they were first observed util we drove out of sight.;34.9463999999999;-92.0321999999998
