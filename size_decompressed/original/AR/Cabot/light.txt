Star grows brighter then dims and shoots off like a rocket!;2007-05-18 21:00:00;15 Seconds;Star grows brighter then dims and shoots off like a rocket! At 2100 on 18 May 2007 I had just returned home. My house sits in a rural section of town. I live on top of a hill with three other houses near by. I entered my house and went out on my back deck to get my dog. I went back out the front door with my dog to let her pee and poop one more time before bed. I was playing with my dog when I looked up to the North sky for no apparent reason. I saw what I thought was a star in the North sky at the 3 O'clock position. It looked normal enough and just sat there. All of a sudden the star grew brighter then dimmer and then shot off straight up so fast it was just gone! The weather was completly clear.;34.9463999999999;-92.0321999999998

My neighbor and I were sending friends off after a long night of intense video games. Standing In his driveway...a bright light comes from the direction of the air force baseâ€¦ It was bright white...with thickness...limited height...didn't cast shadows...and just engulfed everything around us in light...and directly after that the C-130s where flying frantically everywhere...;34.9463999999999;-92.0321999999998
