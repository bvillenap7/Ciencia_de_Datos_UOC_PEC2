Four hanging discs were viewed towards the setting sun.;2015-01-24 17:20:00;1 minute;Four hanging discs were viewed towards the setting sun. While driving south on US highway 67, looking into the horizon towards the setting sun, I saw bright disc shapes in the sky.   There were 4 of them, the best way I can describe the objects are that they looked like bright coins hanging in the sky.   They were not moving as far as I could tell.  They were all oriented different, and not in any formation that I could see.   I asked my wife she sees those, and she turned and confirmed what I saw.   I lost sight of the objects as the view was obscured by tree cover.   The objects were all very bright, with white illumination.;34.9463999999999;-92.0321999999998
