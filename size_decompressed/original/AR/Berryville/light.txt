Multiple colored star-like objects seen moving erratically in the south west sky above Arkansas;2010-08-13 00:00:00;hours;Multiple colored star-like objects seen moving erratically in the south west sky above Arkansas In the southwestern sky about 40 degrees from the horizon was a star like object that flashed red, green, and white light.  It moved several times in left to  right and multi directions.  At times you could see small blinking lights coming toward it and then disappear.  Three other similar objects were found in the same direction but not close to each other.  The movement of the objects is not predictable or regular.  This is the second night that we have seen objects like this.   Sometimes it seems to zoom very quickly up and down and around.   We called someone in Houston and they reported seeing the same object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.3465;-93.5568
