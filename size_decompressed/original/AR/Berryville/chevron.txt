The object could best be described as the shape of a giant boomerang. It appeared to be a dark gray color. Though the front of the UFO was boomerang shaped, it was unclear if there was any form of a tail or other parts to the UFO. It appeared to be flying at roughly 1000 ft. above the ground. It had 4 very dim lights down each wing, totaling 8 dim lights. The object was about 3/4 the size of a crop duster with it's wing span being approximately 14-16 ft. across. It moved at a relatively fast speed but not extremely fast. It made one slight turn with out leaning to turn then shortly disappeared afterwards. In total we watched it for about 10 seconds. Strangely we heard no noise despite the fact it was so close.;36.3465;-93.5568
