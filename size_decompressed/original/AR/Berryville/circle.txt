Circular shaped craft, luminous and silent  with a halo type glow around it flew directly overhead.;2011-07-04 22:00:00;45 seconds;Circular shaped craft, luminous and silent  with a halo type glow around it flew directly overhead. On July 4th 2011 my wife and I were parked on the north end of Berryville, Ar.  Watching the fire works being shot off of Saunders Heights.    At 10:45 P.M., we noticed a very bright multiple colored light to the south of us over Berryville, Arkansas.  We thought it was fire works but it did not disappear, but kept silently moving towards us, maintaining its altitude.  As it passed over head with out making any sound you could see it had a circular luminous shape with a halo type glow around it. There was virtually no breeze.  It seemed to be observing the fireworks, too.  It continued to the north and turned reddish and slowly faded. I am an artist and my wife is a librarian.  We have both spent our entire life in the country and we are very familiar with the night skies and what planes etc. look like. The sighting lasted maybe 45 seconds at most and in 64 years of observing the skies we have never seen anything like that in real life, only on television  shows.  This was definitely not a jet, satellite, conventional aircraft, or  fireworks. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.3465;-93.5568
