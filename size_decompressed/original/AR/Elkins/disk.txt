I saw one saucer with red and orange lights zig zagging from side to side, slowly moving under the Big Dipper and across the treeline from my house.  Then, I saw another saucer-like shape with red and orange lights zig zagging up and down over the treeline across from my house.  Then I went to our back door and saw the two shapes meet up with two more sacuer like shapes with red and orange lights.  Then, there was a burst of light and two of the shapes were gone.  I'm assuming that there was another burst of light and they had left because after that I left the porch and I haven't seen them.;36.0188;-94.0049
