White lights over southern Fayetteville, Arkansas;2017-10-24 20:30:00;5 minutes;White lights over southern Fayetteville, Arkansas Proceeding southbound near Elkins, AR, I witnessed what I thought was a bright star.  When I glanced up, there was a grouping of about 7 lights in a lazy L shape with a grouping of 3-4 other lights to the east and west of the main grouping of lights.  They were single, pinpoint white lights that lit up sequentially, in no discernible pattern, like randomly blinking Christmas lights.  They were slowly moving, in formation, from west to east. Was hard to tell the altitude from the ground but most likely at least 40,000+ feet.  There were no flashing strobes or red and green lights as found on airplanes.  These were single lights.  There was no sound. We drove our route home, towards the east, but my the time we reached the peak of our mountain, the grouping had disappeared.  We continued to watch, as we live in a rural area with minimal light pollution but never saw them again. I am a private pilot with many night hours and I have never before witnessed anything like this.  My partner was with me and we were both in awe of what we were seeing.  I can only hope that someone else saw this and reports it, as well.;36.0188;-94.0049
