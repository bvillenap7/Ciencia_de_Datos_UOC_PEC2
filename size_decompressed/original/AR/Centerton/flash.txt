It continued to do this for about 15 mins.  Then we witnessed 2 flashes lined up next to each other.  They did the same thing, got really bright and then just went.  We also witnessed a bunch of small red lights moving very fast in odd directions around the same vicinity as the bright flashes.   After about an hour they were just gone and didn't come back.   Witnesses were 34, 35, and 10.;36.367;-94.3089
