I admit I'm not knowledgable with anything sky related however, the 2nd object was moving at a high rate of speed and was very bright throughout it's movement until it disappeared.   The 6th object looked to be heading south and gradually got brighter and at it's peak seemed to roll a light that got  so bright I had to turn away for a second.  It was comparable to a spotlight.  It then got dimmer and disappeared.   The others were dim but noticable and clearly passing by stars.  They were all heading north to south or south to north.;36.367;-94.3089
