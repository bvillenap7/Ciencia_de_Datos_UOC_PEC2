It was much higher than I've ever seen a plane fly, there was no noise or contrail, and it was moving at an incredible rate of speed in a perfectly straight line.  I was able to view it for 5 - 10 seconds and then it was gone.  From where I was, it looked like it flew over the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (XNA), so they might have caught it on radar.  I thought maybe it was the ISS, but I don't know if that's visible to the naked eye during the day.;36.367;-94.3089
