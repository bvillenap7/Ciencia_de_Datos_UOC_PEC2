It had two green lights and two white lights, although not configured or spaced as they would be if they were on the aircraft's wings. In anycase, the aircraft disappeared from view just as quickly as it appeared. It was a clear night. A lot has happened in this area since that day---I have kind of lost track of days, so it may have been Friday night the 1st that this happened? And the time frame is approximate as we really weren't expecting to see something like this, nor were we prepared to record the incident as such. It happened nonetheless.;36.27;-92.5721
