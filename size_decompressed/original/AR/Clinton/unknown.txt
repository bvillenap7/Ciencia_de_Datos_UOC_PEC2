I live in north central Arkansas near Greers Ferry Lake.  I stepped outside just after 9PM and noticed nothing unusual in the sky, but within about 5 min, I turned to speak to my husband and noticed two rather large red/orange lights in the eastern part of the sky.  They were side by side like tail lights and they appeared to be no higher than you'd see a care-flight type helicopter.  They hovered just beyond the treetops for just a few moments and before I could even ask my husband what they were, they just disappeared. They didnt shoot off or fly away, they just went out.  There was a low rumble of an airplane in the distance, but it was a regular airplane I could see way up in the distance, other than that the lights had no sound attached.  The lights were fairly large and very bright, but being night, I couldn't accurately figure a distance.  There were no clouds out to reflect anything and we are in a somewhat remote area away from any city lights or vehicle traffic tha! t may cause a reflection. The part of the sky they were in is very sparsely populated and is forested.  I only saw them for about 10 seconds total, and they never returned.  I'm not sure what it could have been, but I know there was no sound relating to the lights and they were low enough, that if it was some type of aircraft the sound would have been deafening.;35.6017;-92.4673
