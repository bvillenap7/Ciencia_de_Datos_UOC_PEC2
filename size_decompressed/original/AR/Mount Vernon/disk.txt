On January 31, 2013 at approximately 9:10 pm I saw several strobbing bright white lights that were in a row, hovering just above the horizon to the west of our home.  It was very cold and windy but the lights were not moving at all.  I ran to get my husband to look at these lights and he saw them as well.  The thing that was almost unbelievable to us is the size of this at least two football fields across.  It seemed as if we were looking at it from the side.  We were watching for approximately five minutes and then it started moving very slowly to the north.  We watched it move about half a mile north and as it moved the lights became fewer and fewer and then all of a sudden it was gone!;35.2296;-92.1265
