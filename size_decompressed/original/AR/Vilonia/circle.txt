I saw an arch of light shaped object moving south slowly, I had to use binoculars to see the arch of light. No lights. A min. later we saw a moving star but it took a drastic turn no aircraft could have made and dissipeared. My friends and I were outside my dad was talking to his friend and I was glaring up a the sky.  I noticed a kot that was moving very slowly so I got my dads binoculars out and followed the object.  It was like a arch that was glowing as if white light was emmiting from it.  I followed the object untill it was out of sight(this took a few minutes). A few minutes later my brother pointed out a moving star it was traveling in a streight line and the made a drastic turn that is not capable with our present tech. and dissipered.  I did not get to view this object through the binoculars.;35.0701;-92.179
