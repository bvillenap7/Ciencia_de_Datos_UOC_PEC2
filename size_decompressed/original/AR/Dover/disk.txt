These ;1999-11-27 19:30:00;30 mins;We were sitting in a large field and we saw this strange object bypassing to jets. The objects were moving at fonominal speeds.  These objects weren't shooting stars because they were moving in a straight line and performing some airontical stunts that no jet could do.  Then ten to twenty minutes later we were watching again with binoculars and this large star dissapeared.  By then we were laughing so we used a flashlight and sent in morse code s.o.s. then a huge light in the distance flared then flew in front of the plane and dispeared. We then freaked out then left. same as above. ((NUFORC Note:  Since the alleged event occurred during dark hours, we presume that the correct time was 7:30 p.m., I.e. 1930 hrs., not 0730 hrs..  We have changed it here.  PD));35.409;-93.1357
