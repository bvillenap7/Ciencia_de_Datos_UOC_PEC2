PD));2009-12-21 21:00:00;2-3 hours;Six egg shaped or actually appeared like they had two parts appeared in the night sky.  One retreated and five remained almost stationa Noting that we live out and all stars are visible and bright on a clear night, we went to the barn to feed horses when I looked up and saw these unusual objects in the sky.  They were not stars nor planets but what they were-who knows?  There were six and they flicked green, gold, and white.  Five of them just seemed to sit there-but one retreated into the night sky.
