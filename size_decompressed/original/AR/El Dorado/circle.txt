Eight Purple Circle like objects...Could it be a UFO?;2003-04-26 07:00:00;5 minutes;Eight Purple Circle like objects...Could it be a UFO? I was going from Crossett Arkansas to Eldorado Arkansas when I decided to take a few pictures of the sunset. When I downloaded them onto my computer(digital camera) I saw that 8 circle like objects were in the 3 pictures I took.They were purplish in color and they were shaped like a circle. A few minutes after I took those 3 pictures I took one more and that was the last one I took. When i dowloaded the pictures the last one was just a normal picture.The ufo-like object were no where to be seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request copies of the photos from this witness, a student, for inspection.  PD));33.2074;-92.6619999999999

It seemed to be about tree top level and traveled so rapidly that we thought whatever it was was going to crash.  Please advise if anyone else saw something of this nature.
