pulsing light changing colors incrideble speed intellegent movements.;2015-10-18 20:00:00;1 hour;pulsing light changing colors incrideble speed intellegent movements. ok so i was sitting outside my house talking on my cell phone and it appeared and moved from left right up and down in no specific direction or pattern so I went in the house got my rifle with hunting scope 50mm 4x24 powered and also told my mother what i had saw and she came outside to see if it was still there I coulnt stay on the craft with the scope because of it moving and difficutly at night it was hard to see it threw the scope so we was just looking at it naked eye and she confirmed that what I had told her was truthful and we both seen it flipping colors red with white outline green and sometimes a quick blue.  i was completely blown away by this as i am fimiliar with drones and air planes also i did a ruff measurment on where the craft had been moving and how long it took it to get there and later seen a plane in the approximate location and it took the air plane some 9 seconds to cover the ground the other craft had in just 2.5 seconds. knowing the average speed of a 747 around 550 mph this craft must have been moving at well over 1000 mph and could stop and turn on a dime. also we was still observing it and it was there and then just like that neither one of us blinked and it was gone. this happened two nights in a row just would like some answers;33.2074;-92.6619999999999
