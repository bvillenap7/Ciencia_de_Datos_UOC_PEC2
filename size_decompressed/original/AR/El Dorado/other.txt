Lights were shaped like V 's. Formation was also a V The summary covers everything. The lights were dim and reddish. It made no sound. I only saw it for a few seconds ( less than five seconds ). I was in town, not in the country, the night sky was clear. It moved more or less from West to East.  Don't know what it was, but I thought I was important enough to report. I don't know how high in the sky it was. I was in my back yard. I am not obsessed with UFO's or anything, I just saw something odd and was wondering if anyone else saw it.;33.2074;-92.6619999999999
