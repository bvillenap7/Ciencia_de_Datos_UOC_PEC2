narrow silver object moving rapidly south;2009-02-04 16:00:00;1-2 min;narrow silver object moving rapidly south I was waiting for my daughter to finish her dance class on a Wednesday in February, either the 4th or the 11th, looking out the window at all the airplanes flying over me.  My car was facing southward, with the sun getting lower to my right.  I remember several of the planes shining brightly silver when they crossed the path of the sunlight. I looked out my window to the left and noticed a silver colored object moving rapidly towards the south. The shape was similar to a blimp, but I was not able to see any sort of fins on the back or anything underneath it. It was also narrower in the body than any blimp I have seen.   It had absolutely no trail behind it at all.  It was low enough that I could see it had no wings, but was higher than any of the local small planes fly.  It traveled across the sky at about the same speed the jets were also traveling.  It lit up brightly when it went through the sunlight, as the jets had also done.  Then it was out of sight behind the building I was facing. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.2074;-92.6619999999999
