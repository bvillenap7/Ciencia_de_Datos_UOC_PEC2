I was cooling off in my backyard swimming pool--It was between 9:30 and 10:00--when the sky lit up in the northwest, and I saw a large object, with fire shooting/sparkling from it, sailing across the sky. As it quickly descended, I awaited the crash but didn't hear anything. The whole event probably lasted 3-5 seconds, but it seemed longer. It was probably a meteorite, but I've never seen one on fire before. What a fantastic sight! (It was so obvious, that I know I'm not the only person in El Dorado, AR who saw it.)
