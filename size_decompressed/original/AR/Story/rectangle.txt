As my wife and I were driving home from a friends, I looked out my window and saw a red and green light  out my window.  I stopped the car, told my wife to get out of the car and look up.  We both wittnessed for two minutes 2 craft flying close together weaving and moving very irraticly.  Their motion was extremely smothe.  We drove home to get the camera because our house was less than a mile away, but by the time we returned they were gone. I have a Ph.D. in Theology, and an Assoc. Degree in Computer Science.  My wife is a CNA.;34.6685;-93.5397
