Bright yellow/ornage fireball going W to E across the Northern sky.;2008-11-20 23:45:00;2 minutes;Bright yellow/ornage fireball going W to E across the Northern sky. Something went across the northern sky (W to E) so bright that it reminded me of an old fashioned comet illustration. Very bright with a long tail. I have a standard size window facing north and it completely filled the window pane. I watched for a moment then went outside and it was gone...but interestingly as I was watching the sky 2 different planes went across going the same direction, from the west to the east. I've watched many a meteor shower and have never seen anything like this!;35.7832;-91.6369
