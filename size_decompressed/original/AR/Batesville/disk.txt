Well I was in the house visting with some of my mom and dads friends when my little sister came running in and telling me to come outside because there was something floating in the sky. at first I thought that she was kidding so I went outside and there it was floating about 15 feet of the ground hovering over a field about a 150 yards away.  It was so beautiful it was kinda shine, and it kinda looked like what you see on tv but it was one solid object, it looked seemless. it was dark so it is hard to remember all the details, but it did have lights on the bottom. it shot up in the air about 50 feet and stop dead in its tracks then it moved to the right and stoped. then it moved to the left and stoped. and then it shot out of sight in a blink of an eye.  I thought that we were the only ones to see it but there where other people who people who saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date apparently is approximate.  PD));35.7832;-91.6369
