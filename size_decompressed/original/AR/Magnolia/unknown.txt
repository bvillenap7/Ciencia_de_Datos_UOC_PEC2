Unidentified aircraft playing tag in the night sky over Magnolia Arkansas;2007-01-01 19:00:00;5 minutes;Unidentified aircraft playing tag in the night sky over Magnolia, Arkansas Driving north on Hwy 79, between Emerson Arkansas and Magnolia, Arkansas. I saw a light in the sky. White and of the appearance of a landing light for an aircraft.  Then I saw a second light come on very near and at the same altitude. Then I saw a third light come on very close to the other and in a straight line.   I thought of ECM flares.  The lights then went off.  I could then see three flashing lights much like the strobes on standard aircraft.  One strobe light went east and one went west at very fast speeds.  If the altitude was 2,000 feet then the speed would have been around 500 mph.  I saw the strobes stop moving and reconverge on the first sight.  I then saw the strobes moving amost like playing tag.  During the next five minutes I could see the Landing lights turn on and turn off at random times. I thought perhaps three helicopters playing tag with their landing lights.  They were much to fast for helicopters.  They were too manuverable for fixed wing aircraft.   I have spent a very long time in the USAF and am a current pilot of fixed wing aircraft. I have seen just about all known aircraft under all possible conditions.  I have not encountered this situation before. My work is sensitive and I would rather not submit my contact information.
