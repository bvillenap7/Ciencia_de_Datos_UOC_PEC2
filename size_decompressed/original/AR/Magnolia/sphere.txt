Copper colored spherical object seen moving through the air at low altitude very fast.;2015-02-12 16:11:00;<1 minute;Copper colored spherical object seen moving through the air at low altitude very fast. I was in a light airplane about 1000 feet above the ground, when I noticed a copper colored spherical object moving through the air towards me at a very high rate of speed.   The ufo passed my left wing seemingly lower than me at an unknown distance.   I watched it for as long as I could until it disappeared from my sight.  I could not gauge the ufo size very well but it seemed small.  Much smaller than any aircraft.  But, it was very noticeable none the less.
