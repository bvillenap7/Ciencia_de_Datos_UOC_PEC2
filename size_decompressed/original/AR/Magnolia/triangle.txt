Triangle Craft spins overhead and then speeds away.;2003-11-19 02:30:00;30 Seconds;Triangle Craft spins overhead and then speeds away. I don't drink... I don't smoke.... I work at a church.  I was at Southern Arkansas University one night at about 2:30 a.m. I was with a friend and we were talking... We were sitting in a swing, overlooking a pond and a big open sky... In the middle of our conversation, I stopped and exclaimed holy crap! Off in the distance, I saw three lights, shaped like a triangle, spinning and getting closer to us... finally, it got pretty close and lights were pretty large and they stopped spinning and just sat there.  The lights were white. No sound or anything... She saw it and we sat in awe for about 30 seconds... then, the craft turned back and jotted away very quickly.
