light ufo seen on arkansas highway between Little Rock and Pine Bluff appearing to land in nearby woods.;2003-11-18 23:45:00;7 seconds;light ufo seen on arkansas highway between Little Rock and Pine Bluff appearing to land in nearby woods. I was driving home one night from Little Rock to Pine Bluff after band practice.  When i got about three fourths of the way home, i noticed a very bright and consistent white light pop out of nowhere over the freeway, which appeared to be miles away and at least 1000 feet in the air.  As soon as it appeared it swooped down to the right side of the expressway and into the treeline there was no explosion that I could see. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Low-flying, silent white light resembling a star over my home.;2017-05-24 21:00:00;7-10 minutes;Low-flying, silent white light resembling a star over my home. My husband and I were on our way back from picking up a pizza and after I'd climbed out of our truck something just told me to look up.  When I did, I noticed a light that was as bright as one of the brightest starts moving quickly and steadily across the sky.  I called my husband over quickly because he was lagging behind me.  He rushed over and was just as dumbfounded as I.   At that moment I rushed into my home, leaving my husband to keep observing, placed my pizza on the sofa, and called my neighbor outside.  He was awaiting our return with the pizza.  He rushed out and all 3 of us watched this object.  At this time we noticed that this light, although as bright as a star, was much lower because you could actually see it moving below the real stars.   Whatever this light was, it never made a sound, it never changed colors, and the speed and flight path never changed.  At some point my neighbor pulled out his cellphone and began recording the object until it eventually flew out of sight.  If the object would have stopped, it would have been indistinguishable from a star.  Its movement is what provided the perspective that it was lower than actual stars.;34.1924695652174;-92.0379
