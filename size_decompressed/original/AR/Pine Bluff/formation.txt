It was between 9 and 10 p.m. September 5, 2008. Standing outside on a one way street called 28th st. in pine bluff arkansas. My line of sight just happened to look towards the sky. I seen what seemed to be a flying triangle almost similiar to how ducks fly in a V-shape formation. With my eyes trained upon the object it looked as if there were more than one air craft more like six or seven bluish green glowing objects flying very high and fast. The V-shape seemed to fluctuate as if some of the aircrafts had flown a little to close to one side made the V-shape look a little distorted. Afterwards there were several slow flying objects in the sky. What seemed to be regular airplanes with those flashing red and blue lights that you see at night.;34.1924695652174;-92.0379
