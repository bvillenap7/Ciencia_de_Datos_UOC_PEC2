Heard distant almost sub-audible rumbling sound similar to a train or heavy traffic from very far away minus any horns or engine noise, could actually feel very slightly  in feet from ground.  Assumed was I-40 traffic about 5 miles north, which is possible under right conditions.  Two objects seen due north barely above tree tops with steady white lights on each end and flashing light in center, one behind other, on steady southwesterly course towards possibly Ft. Chaffee near Ft. Smith.  Seemed to  pass just west of school at very low height barely above major power line before losing sight.  Extremely quiet and barely audible considering proximity.  Normal helicopters way noisier.   IÂ´m guessing military yet still think against regs to fly so low over populated space?;35.4476;-93.6136
