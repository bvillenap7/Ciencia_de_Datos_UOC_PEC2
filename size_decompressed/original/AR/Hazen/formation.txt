 I focused and saw a straight line of lights ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 05:45:00;5 minutes;Early morning, I walked outside and looked up to observe the stars (per usual to my morning routine) I was looking south and I saw what I thought at first glance was a shooting star.  I focused and saw a straight line of lights. I could tell they were spinning because the light on one end would fade out as the lights on the other end would brighten and I could see it turning.  I watched it move across the sky for about 5 minutes and it moved further into the distance until I could not see it anymore.  I went to work and learned another person witnessed the same encounter in the south sky.;34.7876;-91.5767
