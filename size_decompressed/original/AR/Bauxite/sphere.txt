Saw metallic spherical object, disappeared in the sky;2013-08-15 19:45:00;20 seconds;Saw metallic spherical object, disappeared in the sky On August 15th, 2013, at 7:45 pm my husband and I were driving home from a lake up north. We were on our way home.  It was still light out.  We were in Bauxite, Arkansas, near the post office there right at the Bauxite cutoff road.  My husband was driving and I was in the passenger seat. I was looking up at the sky and I noticed what I thought was an airplane or some kind of aircraft. It was silver, shiny, and metallic.  I joked to my husband that I thought it was a UFO because it was rather oddly shaped, spherical but not like an airplane. As I was watching this object in the southern sky, it made a turn and went west.  Then, all of a sudden, the object disappeared right in front of my eyes!  I immediately checked my phone app to see if there was a satellite in the vicinity.  There was not. I am still trying to figure out how this object disappeared.  It was very high up, like an upper altitude airplane.;34.51;-92.4841
