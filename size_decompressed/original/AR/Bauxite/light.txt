I was on my way home from a date around 1:30 Saturday morning. In Bauxite, I turned left at the light onto W Sardis Rd.   As I was driving, I happened to look up and I saw this enormous amount of light in a near distance.  I knew it wasn't a shooting star or a plain because I had never seen anything like it! This light was a pinkish purplish color and very bright.  Nothing but light.  The light seemed like it was falling from space down to Earth.  For a second I thought it could have been a meteor or something like that, but then it just disappeared.  It just disappeared instantly.   I believe that it was a UFO sighting, and I will continue to believe this until there is some way to prove the enormous odd colored light heading for Earth's surface and then disappearing.;34.51;-92.4841
