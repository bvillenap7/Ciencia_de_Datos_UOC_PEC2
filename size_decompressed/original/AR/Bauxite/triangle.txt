My wife took the trash out last night around 11:30 p.m. central time. I was sleeping she say's the craft was triangle in shape. It had a large round light in center and a number of smaller light's around the edges. It was dark in shape. The lights at the corners blinked seperate from the other lihgt in between at the edges. They blinked at different times. The light in the middle stayed on constantly. All lights were white in color no other color's noted. It moved southwest to northeast. She tells me it took two to three minutes to move across her field of site. Last night was clear and had a long range of view, all stars were and bright out. She is deaf and could not hear if it was making any noise. She say's it was flying very low to the ground 300 to 500 feet off ground. It was approx: 150 feet in size, lager then a 757.  This is the best I can do translate for her.;34.51;-92.4841
