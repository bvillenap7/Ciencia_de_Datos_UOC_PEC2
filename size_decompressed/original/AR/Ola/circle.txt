bright circle object;2020-07-04 17:00:00;5 minutes;bright circle object I was outside with my family on the fourth setting off fireworks.  looked up at a fireworks and saw a white circle object.  I thought it was a space station going over but on looking to see if it was coming back over found out it had not come over at all and was not coming over.  we watched it go from West to East no noise no flashing light watched it till it went out of sight.;35.0307;-93.215
