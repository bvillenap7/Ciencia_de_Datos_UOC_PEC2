I was very startled by the object, so I sped out of the area as fast as possible, my boyfriend reported to me that the electricity at his house was flickering on and off at about the same that I saw the ufo.;35.8103572093023;-90.7273362790701
Diamond shaped fuselage with multiple red lights, sweepted wings with multiple white lights...amazing!;2003-05-07 02:00:00;30 seconds;Diamond shaped fuselage with multiple red lights, sweepted wings with multiple white lights...amazing! At 0200 hours while standing on my porch looking up at the sky as a thunderstorm had just passed our area, the sky was relatively clear except for a few small low clouds,just above the height of the clouds I saw a Diamond shaped fuselage with sweepted back wings, the lower fuselage was covered in Red lights (approx.50) in a grid pattern while the wings were covered with White/Silvery lights (approx.20 each wing) in a grid pattern, between the wings and fuselage it was black, which is why I could see the definite shape. It flew from North to South in about 30 seconds and then went out of view in the clouds. There were engine sounds trailing it. I've worked in aviation for over 30 years and I've never seen anything like this!;35.8103572093023;-90.7273362790701
