Silent, dark, fast moving object spotted over Jonesboro, AR.;2014-11-17 23:20:00;10 seconds;Silent, dark, fast moving object spotted over Jonesboro, AR. I was out walking my dog and looking for meteors.  I saw what looked like a faint shimmer above me, really far up in the air.  It was hard to distinguish the shape. It was triangular, but also somewhat of a chevron. I thought it was a flock of geese at first, but I realized it was moving way too quickly to be geese, and it was completely silent.  The whole event, from me spotting it overhead, to it moving out of sight over neighboring buildings took less than 5 seconds. It looked to be about as high up as a personal airplane, but there were no lights.  I could only distinguish that is was moving because of the fact that is was blocking out starlight as it moved over.  It is a very quiet night and I can easily hear planes and birds at that height. I could also faintly see what might have been a faint reflection of the streetlights on the underside of the object, but the reflection was irregular, which is why I at first thought that it was a flock of birds of geese.;35.8103572093023;-90.7273362790701
