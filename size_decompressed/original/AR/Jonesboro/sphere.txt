Colorful flashing and drifting orb somewhere close to Memphis TN as viewed from Jonesboro AR.  ((NUFORC Note: Sirius?  PD));2011-01-13 19:30:00;Unknown, too cold;Colorful flashing and drifting orb somewhere close to Memphis TN as viewed from Jonesboro Arkansas http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcCA9_6Gc9Y   I just looked up and saw the strangest, beautiful orb blinking in the air so I got my camera.  It's moving around a bit and flashing every color you could see.  Obviously it's also emitting lots of IR.  The sky was totally clear and the camera could only pick up the orb and the radio tower near it. I can upload the original high quality version to my FTP server if you want it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcCA9_6Gc9Y ((NUFORC Note: Sirius?  PD));35.8103572093023;-90.7273362790701
