Flying Box with No Marker Lights;2013-11-10 21:00:00;2 minutes;Flying Box with No Marker Lights Was sitting in my vehicle speaking to my girlfriend, when I noticed a gray box moving (in the peripheral of my left eye).  My car was facing east (towards Tennessee) and the box was north of town.  It appeared to be about 1.5-2 miles above ground and maybe about 10 miles north of the Jonesboro.  The box (or dark gray spot) was traveling from west to east. And when I started paying attention, it went behind a building in my apartment complex (which broke my line of sight).  I stepped outside my car and noticed the box traveled back into my line of sight, going from east to west.  I proceeded to tell my girlfriend what I was seeing.  I then noticed the box make a turn northwards, slow down, then accelerate and disappear (it didnâ€™t fade into the distance, it just disappeared). I could see the box because the ambient lighting of the city lit up the sky, and it was darker than the surrounding area.  Also, it did not have any marker lights (red, white, amber).  Lastly, the turn radius it had was too small for an airplane but too large for a helicopter.  Additionally, an exhaust/vapor trail was non-existent and the pulsating, whirring sound that you get when helicopters are traveling was not deciphered (which should be for a quiet Sunday night).
