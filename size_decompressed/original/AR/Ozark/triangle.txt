We were driving on interstate 40 from Ozark to Alma, AR.  Driving West it was South West of the interstate between Ozark and Mulberry.  The craft was rather large, and almost looked like a plane, but it had bright lights on the lower portion of the majority of the object.  It was daylight and the lights were very bright.  It was hovering between 5000-10,000 feet I believe.;35.5281;-93.8413
