Ufo in the sky at bentonville arkansas;2011-09-02 21:00:00;45min;Ufo in the sky at bentonville arkansas i was driving home after watching a movie in the theatre, i saw somthing move twards the moon, i then knew somthing was going on.. i pulled into the cum n go closest to there jumped out and i and my wife were looking into the sky at these unknown objects. there were people starting to look up aswell im am unsure what these could be, but there is no doubt in my mind that these were from this world they moved far away and back rapidly very quickly after 4 minutes of watching them they started to cluster in a formation and startled my wife and she was ready to leave. i went home and 10 min later i returned to the sight and they were still there. they were disk with a little light under the object not very bright at all they seemed dim but you notice them when they move, this has been life changing for me, i hope others seen it aswell.;36.3466918604651;-94.2391860465114
