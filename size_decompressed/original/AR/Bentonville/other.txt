Hoseshoe shaped;1970-10-01 17:30:00;about 4 hours;Hoseshoe shaped In the 1970's an unidentified craft was sighted over Bentonville Arkansas. It was horseshoe shaped, had red lights around it outside, stayed in the same place for hours. When my parents and uncle called in to report it they were told that people were calling from all over the area and they had no idea what it was.  Three little red lights went up to it from 3 different areas, and when they got up to it, they seemed to be triangulated to it, it took off quickly.  My parents who saw it along with one of my uncles never saw or heard anything about the object afterward.  My mother had never seen a UFO before, but her uncle worked at a base in Texas during the Roswell Incident.  He told her about how coffins guarded men with machine guns were hauled through there and he was told not to talk about it.  This, however, never affected her judgement on whether UFOs were real before this incident.  (She had a somewhat sceptical belief of aliens and UFOs) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.3466918604651;-94.2391860465114
Was I abducted in 1973????????????;1973-06-01 00:00:00;hours;Was I abducted in 1973???????????? I was only 5 or 6, but was awakened some how and I saw what seemed to be a square shaped somthing with several different colored lights on the outside, the next thing I knew I was with this strang looking something (not the usual described alien)  We did things together  but do not remember much of what happened but when I'd tell my parents about it they said I was dreaming it, I did'nt.  Then after this night I would have strange dreams of being squeezed or a feeling of being squeezed and a strange noise that would awake me screaming.  I also remember having earaches and hearing a sound in my mind every now and then, I still today hear this sound in my mind.  My most wanted to know question is- does any one else have this occur?  I also seem to know things before they happen but it comes automatically, I can't seem to be able to control it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  Date is approximate.
