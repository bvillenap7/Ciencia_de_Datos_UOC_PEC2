five gold colored reflective or metalic orbs in formation.;2001-10-15 09:15:00;five min;five gold colored reflective or metalic orbs in formation. I had steped outside to walk my dog. I always take my bi-nocs because the stars are harder to see here because on my proximity to a sports complex. I saw movement comming from the west. Through bi-noc I could see 5 gold colored shiny orbs moving nw they were in loose formation but stayed together until they dissapeared into the horizon over missouri . I came in and immediately wrote sown time and date so I would remember exact time. There was another small aircraft that was in the air then. He had to have seen them as well. they were the size of a eraserhead at arms length. There are many objects seen around here many people talk of activity in the air. Times dates and location are precise. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.3466918604651;-94.2391860465114
