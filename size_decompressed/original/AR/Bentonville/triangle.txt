Perfect triangle, est 15x15x15, 6 or so lights on each town in night time.  ((anonymous report));2019-07-26 21:30:00;3 minutes;Perfect triangle, est 15x15x15, 6 or so lights on each town in night time. This was seen from at least a half mile away, while driving on interstate 540 from bellavista going into Bentonville.  I pointed it to my kids thinking it was a blimp with massive lights on the bottom...  strange though as the formed a perfect triangle.  The lights on the bottom were set on straight rows at least 15 foot by 15 foot by 15 foot.  These lights were all white, and on each row there were at least 5 or 6 lights that were clearly individual lights.  My kid attempted pictures while I was driving but the first was black and second was blurry.  I suspect possible military craft but doesnâ€™t make sense due to perfect shape would not be condusive to long distance travel.  As we approached closer the craft began to move after being completely stationary for 2 minutes and crossed the interstate and headed toward bella vista fairly quickly.  Thinking military or private owned..  so large maybe someone built there own thing and was riding on it?  We confined! on our trip toward Fayetteville.  4 witnesses...  kids suggested a little haze when it moved.  Definitely clear no haze when stationary.
