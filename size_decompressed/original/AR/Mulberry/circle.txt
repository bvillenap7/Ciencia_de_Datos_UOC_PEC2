The object seemed to be moving faster than a typically seen light aircraft in the area.  The object was seen in a southwesterly direction from the city of Mulberry, Arkansas (Western Arkansas).  The object moved north then turned and proceeded west.  There was some dusk light on the horizon.   We dismissed it as an aircraft, but the appearance simply didnâ€™t fit with typical marker lights of a light or even higher flying jet.  I  and my family live near an airport in Fayetteville, AR, and are airplane observers.  I have been involved in identifying aircraft and have made a hobby of learning about airplanes for over 30 years.  I am a science instructor as well.  The objects main characteristic was the orange color and was very strange as an observer looked at it head on.  The orange color did change somewhat as its direction changed.    I dismissed this sighting until I heard that many others throughout the country had seen objects on the same night.  (What we saw was not a fireworks display.);35.5172;-93.9885
