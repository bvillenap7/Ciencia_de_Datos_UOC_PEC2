It didn't blink and it was unusualy bright, it also was traveling lower then most aircraft. Then that night at abought 9:30pm I saw It again this time directly over head traveling south. It was extremely bright orange and a solid light.It was flying at the normal speed of an aircraft but at abought half the height,and made no sound at all, it also apeared to be shakeing or wolbing left to right very rapidly. When I saw it this time I called me wife out to see it, she said what in the world is that. After abought 60 seconds it changed from orange to red and faded out.I have never seen anything I couldn't explain. I'm often out doors because I smoke and my wife and son do not.
