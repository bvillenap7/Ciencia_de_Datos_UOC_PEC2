Blinking, multi-colored lights below clouds outside Ft. Chaffee.;2000-11-15 18:00:00;seconds;Blinking, multi-colored lights below clouds outside Ft. Chaffee. Traveling east on Hwy 10 dark, cloudy night.  Outside of Ft. Chaffee above fishing lake blinking lights as if wanting to be seen.  Sure the trucker behind and ahead of me saw it.  5 miles further, still outside of Ft. Chaffee appeared again, very large, unsure of shape, blinking red, green, blue lights, again wanting to be seen (by me?)  I pulled into my road very secluded sure I'd get better view but then noted it was cloudy and couldn't see any stars so pretty sure it wanted to be seen.  (My first and I'm thrilled).;35.1949;-94.25
