Triangle shape moving slowly north to south at night.;2016-01-04 21:00:00;30 seconds;Triangle shape moving slowly north to south at night. The object passed overhead while I was driving east on Hwy 22.  Object was traveling north to south at a slow rate of speed.  Estimated height of 500 feet.   Object had 3 equally spaced white lights that formed a triangle with equal sides with a blue/green light in the center that was not flashing.  Groups of 3-4 C130 aircraft frequently fly a similar route, but they always have navigation lights flashing when I have seen them after dark.   This object did not appear to be a solo aircraft, and the lighting was not what I typically see on the C130 aircraft.;35.32;-93.4467
