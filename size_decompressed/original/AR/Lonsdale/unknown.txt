It came and left shortly after.;2013-09-24 20:45:00;20 minutes;It came and left shortly after. On this evening my two boys, boyfriend and myself were in our yard having a bond fire.  My boyfriend and I were playing dominoes when all of the sudden I noticed what appeared to be fireworks shooting across the sky.  I was speechless slapping on the table and pointing to the sky.  My kids saw the same thing I saw.  At first I thought I was meteorite, until 15-20 mins later we saw an object with a green light rise from the same spot in the trees that the meteorite had went down.  One problem MEDEORITES DON'T RISE FROM THE GROUND AND FLY BACK WHERE THEY COME FROM AT VERY HIGH SPEED!   Before we know it the green light had shot through the night sky and vanished.
