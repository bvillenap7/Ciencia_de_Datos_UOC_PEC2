I live on a farm and I watch the sky every night.  The light/ Star was right above the trees and looked as if it was a cellphone tower.  But it was much brighter than one and was not flashing.  I followed it all the way home and got my two brothers to come out and watch it it was there, then it went away and appeared again slightly to the west where it started to flicker then get extremely bright and then disappear.   The original direction was 307 north west then it changed to 290 west I live at 299 north ridge road.  Hopefully this was help;35.9546;-91.5447
