Film negative anomalies pertaining to photo related to March, 1997 report;1997-03-24 01:30:00;~1 minute;Film negative anomalies pertaining to photo related to March, 1997 report This is a follow-up of a report I filed in March of 1997, concerning a craft seen in Bigelow, Arkansas, at about 1:30 AM.  I spoke with Peter Davenport after making the report, and was even asked to speak on Coast to Coast A.M. but have not seen the report in your archives. While the negative can not be properly analyzed by e-mail, the image's anomalous nature can be conveyed.  The image is anomalous for several reasons.  For one, the image should be nothing more than three points of light in the center of the frame, and possibly a dim reflection.  Instead, the image is a large and blurry representation of the UFO, and crosses OVER the photo frame.  One can only imagine the mechanism responsible for affecting the film where light could not reach.  Stranger still, a similar image was burned into two other frames that had been taken earlier.   One of these other two was sent to MUFON, but not returned.  I took three photos as the craft passed over to thoroughly document the sighting. When developed, two of the sighting frames were blank but for a night sky the other  frame has the large image. So there are three negative images of the UFO, but two of them are superimposed on earlier frames rather than those on which they belong. A better understanding of the mechanism involved in producing these photo anomalies might reveal much about the mechanism behind the UFO's propulsion or operation. The anomaly might have resulted from simple cause-and-effect because of proximity, or might have resulted from some action related to concealment.
