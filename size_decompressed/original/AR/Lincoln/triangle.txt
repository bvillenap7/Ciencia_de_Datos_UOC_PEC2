My wife and I were sitting on the back deck with our children watching the Supermoon/Lunar Eclipse.  At 9:43, the kids had just gone inside when my wife and I saw a triangular craft directly in the sight of the moon.  The craft had blue and red lights blinking rapidly, and there were stationary lights shining on the bottom.  While in sight of the moon, the craft maneuvered with 90 degree angles and what seemed like sharp figure 8 motions.  A few seconds after moving sporadically, the craft stabilized and flew in a straight line out of sight.  Besides the impressive maneuvering, the triangular craft moved at a rate of speed seeming faster than what a jet would.  The craft looked solid with its triangular shape.;35.9564;-94.4279
