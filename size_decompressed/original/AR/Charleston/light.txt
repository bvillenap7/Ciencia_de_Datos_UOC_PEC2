((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Mars.  PD))  A bright dancing light in the south-southeast sky.;2003-08-07 00:20:00;2 Hours;A bright dancing light in the south-southeast sky. I saw a bright round light and at first glance I didn't think much of it, but then it started zig-zaging and dancing all over the place. I grabbed some high powered bino's and my cell phone to call my friends, and the light was moving all over the place! From what I could tell, it appeared to be a single bright light and when it seemed to dim, or turn it left a trail, and you could make out a few more dimmer lights on the side. My friends from Vesta and Van Buren reported the same thing. It changed degrees and altitudes several times until it seemed to rest in the southern sky.  Sometimes the dimmer lights would grow brighter, so I'm not sure if it was just one or more. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been look at mars.  PD));35.3119;-94.038
