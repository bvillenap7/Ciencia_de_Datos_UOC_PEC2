My Wife was let the dog out and seen a bright object in the sky then it got real dim.  She called me to come look at it and said our friends was back because we have seen this 4 aor 5 times in the past 17 years.  So I went out to look at it and sure enough it was bright then it would get dim it would move then stop.  I watched it for abut 15 min. and it just disappeared.;36.3932;-91.9941
