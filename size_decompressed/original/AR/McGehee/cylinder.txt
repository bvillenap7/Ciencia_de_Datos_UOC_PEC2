Similar airplane lighted and look (except red and blue) of object that was stationary and not making any disernible noise.;2014-12-13 04:40:00;Watched about 5 min then ;Similar airplane lighted and look (except red and blue) of object that was stationary and not making any disernible noise. Me and my son were leaving to go deer hunting.  Saw the red and blue lights on either end or side and thought it must be an airplane but soon realized it wasn't moving and that it wasnt a helicopter.  Asked my son to get back out of truck to look and used my binoculars to look at it.  Both of us noticed what appeared to be a reflective ball underneath that could not be seen with the naked eye.  It was still in the same position when we left approximately 5 minutes later.   I AM NOT A UFO PHANATIC however, it must have had some purpose.  Google Earth maybe?;33.6353;-91.3898
