SEE DETAILED REPORT Triangular Object - 8-15-1999 At about 5:55 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. CDT my wife Karen and I were driving west bound on US Highway 64 about half way between Memphis, TN, and Bald Knob, AR, or about 75 miles west of Memphis, Tn.  We were very near and just to the east of McCrory, AR, we saw the following: We witnessed a triangular shaped object in the western sky above the town over McCrory.  It was about the size of a man's thumbnail, if your arm was fully extended.  It was on it's side (?) as we could see all three points of the triangle at the same time.  It was white not silver in color. The strange part of this sighting is that it was moving (in my opinion) slow but it left a streak or trail behind it - as wide as what it was.  I viewed it for about 10 to 15 seconds, my wife for 5 to 10 seconds - the tail extended from one side of our windshield (passenger side) to almost directly in front of the drive.  It then vanished - not just the object, but the trail as well.  There was no trace of anything. The object was traveling to the south it was a clear sky.  It was about 15 to 20 degrees above the road or horizon.
