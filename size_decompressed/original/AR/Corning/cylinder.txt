I was driving from my town of Corning, Arkansas, towards Pocahontas, Arkansas, at about between 5:30-5:45AM.   I was heading towards work and just ahead of me, suddenly appeared a smoke-like pillar of light!  I'm not sure how far away exactly it was, but it was probably about the width of a 4 way road.   It appeared so bright that the entire countryside around it was semi-visible when before then it wasn't since it was so early in the morning and dark!   I watched it for about ten seconds, then as I grabbed my phone to take a picture it vanished!  Never re-appearing though I kept my eye out for it.   It was really eerie!
