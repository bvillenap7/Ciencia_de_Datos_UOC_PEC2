I was home from college for the 4th of July. After our celebration some of my family was sitting outside and talking.  My friend pointed to the sky and said, Look at that! We all looked up, and a bright white light was moving fast above us, going in the west to east direction.  It was flying lower than a satellite, maybe about the same height as a plane, but it was much brighter.  For about twenty seconds is flew in one direction, but then started to slowly turn in the south direction. We were all certain the light was not a satellite, it moved much faster, lower, and the light was very bright.  It could not have been an airplane because it had no emergency lights, and no noise was detected. As the light turned south it started to slow down.  My father and I stood watching it and the light started to fade.  It kept moving south, but the light got dimmer and dimmer until it faded out.  My dad and I sat in the field talking about it, and about four minutes later the light appeared in almost the exact spot it had faded out in.  I flashed very brightly four or five times and then slowly faded out again. My dad and I yelled for everyone to come and see it.  My niece and one of my friends saw the fading light.  My dad and I are the only ones to witness the full duration of the sighting, but about seven people saw different glimpses of it.  It was flying too high in the sky, and for too long, to be a firework.;34.1598;-94.3144
