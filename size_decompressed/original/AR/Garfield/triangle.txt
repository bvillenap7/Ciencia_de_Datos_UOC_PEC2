I observed this with my husband, a veteran Air Force fighter pilot (retired Colonel), and commercial pilot (retired).  He stated it was the most unusual thing he's ever seen in his 30+ years of flying experience. I am a Physical Therapist at an inpatient rehabilitation hospital on Oklahoma City.;36.4255;-93.9483
