2 LIIGHTS OVER BEAVER LAKE.;2006-10-03 20:15:00;about 45 sec.;2 LIIGHTS OVER BEAVER LAKE. WE HAD A POWER OUTAGE, I WENT OUT SIDE TO TURN OUR GENERATOR ON. I LOOKED UP AND SAW A LIGHT DESENDING FROM THE EAST. IT STOPED ITS DESENT AND LIT UP VERY VERY BRIGHT FOR ABOUT 3 SECONDS AND DIMMED. IT THEN STARTED TO ACCEND AND MOVE SOUTH VERY FAST. IT SLOWED ALMOST TO A STOP. THEN OUT OF THE NORTH APPERD A SECOND LIGHT THAT WAS THE SAME SIZE AND BRIGHTNESS AS THE FIRST LIGHT. IT MOVED TOWRD THE FIRST LIGHT AND CAUGHT UP WITH IT. THEY STOPED SIDE BY SIDE AND STAYED THERE ABOUT 15 SEC. UNTILL THEY BOTH ACCENDED STRAIGHT UP OUT OF SIGHT. TO THE NORTH THERE WAS AIR TRAFFIC THAT WAS IN LINE OF SIGHT TO THE LIGHTS. I WAS ABLE TO COMPARE THE SPEED OF THE JET TO THE LIGHTS. THE JETS HEADING WAS SOUTH WEST AND COULD SEE ITS STROBE LIGHTS AND CONTRAIL. THE SPEEDS OF THE 2 LIGHTS WERE MUCH FASTER THEN THE JET. I USED TO BE A LINE TECH AND HAVE BEEN AROUND AVIATION MOST MY LIFE. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A AIR CRAFT BEHAVE LIKE THOSE LIGHTS BEFORE LAST NIGHT.
