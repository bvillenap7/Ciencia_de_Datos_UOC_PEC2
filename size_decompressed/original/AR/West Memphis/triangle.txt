Shiny triangle craft with dim lights flying just above tree tops.;1998-11-29 19:55:00;10 seconds;Shiny triangle craft with dim lights flying just above tree tops. I was in my brother's yard walking toward my truck. I looked up at the sky and I saw a triangle shaped craft flying just above the tee tops. The streetlights were reflecting off the bottom and I got a good look at this shiny silver triangle shaped craft. It had dim yellow lights on each corner. It was horizontal with the ground and then the nose of the craft tipped to a 45 degree angle and it kept flying straight forward. Then the craft turned sharply to the left and disappeared behind a group of trees. I listened for the usual airplane engine sound and heard nothing. For approximately 30 minutes after this event, I noticed low flying aircraft around the area and then they all left too.;35.1519;-90.1774
