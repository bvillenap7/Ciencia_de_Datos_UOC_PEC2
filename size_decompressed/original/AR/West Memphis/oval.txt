Moving fast. I was watching a con trail from a jet overhead.  I watched a bronze colored, oval shaped craft fly through the con trail, turn around an come back through it.  It left no trail of its own.  I reached to get my phone from my daughter to video.  When I looked back up I couldnâ€™t locate it.;35.1519;-90.1774
