Atmospheric Event distorting the light of the stars?;2011-02-15 23:26:00;30 minutes;Atmospheric Event distorting the light of the stars? I was outside last night around 11:25 pm CST, to have a cigarette.  I was immediately noticed that Jupiter looked odd.  It looks much brighter than normal, and had a long red tail as the bottom point of light.   I watched this for a few minutes, the looked around to notice that all the stars appears to look extremely cross shaped, with a  distinct red tail at the bottom.  There were several aircraft in the area, flying that didn't appear to have these characteristics.  Clouds rolled in shortly after.  I am assuming this was some sort of atmospheric condition that is causing this.   I wasn't able to find any info, by searching on the internet.  So i figured i would post here.;36.3312;-92.3753
Three brilliant bright lights in a spaced line formation attached to an incredibly large aircraft in a diagonal position.;2012-10-05 18:45:00;3-5 minutes;Three brilliant bright lights in a spaced line formation attached to an incredibly large aircraft in a diagonal position. Observed the three lights/aircraft while driving.  My daughter noticed the crisp white LARGE lights to our left. The aircraft was in a diagonal position which appeared to be barely moving enough to remain in flight.  Practically stationary. It's altitude was extremely low for it to be a normal aircraft.  No mechanical sound was heard, ruling out it being a helicopter. The shape as I'm best to describe was unusually flat and large, with a very wide berth. Behind the lights, the shape was not very distinct. It remained in the diagonal position then abruptly disappeared. Total duration of sighting, 3-5 min. Luckily my daughter was present, otherwise I would not have believed my own eyes. Not mentioning it to any, as I would get looks of a nutter.;36.3312;-92.3753
