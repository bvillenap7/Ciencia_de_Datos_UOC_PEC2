The orange glowing ball dipped down into the trees and back up to the top of the trees. We can’t tell you when it left the area. I was asking my friend what he thought it was and was worried about getting home and that’s all we can tell. I have been up all afternoon working on semi trucks with all 4 shop doors open so we could get a breeze going through the building and was planning to leave at 9pm on the 20th but 	 me and my friend found ourselves looking at this fire ball thing at 4:30 am floating around the tree tops. We should have been at home sleeping several hours ago. I did notice the coyotes we really howling and the shop cat was making weird growling noises? Has there been any other reports about this?
