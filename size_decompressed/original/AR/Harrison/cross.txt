My friend and I we're sitting on my back porch last night just shootin the bull, when out of no where we see these three red and green lights coming our way.  Pretty soon, there were seven of them.  The lights were arraigned with one red light on front and two greens on the sides.  They we're flying around i don't really think they had a pattern to them butit was sort of like they were just flying in circles around my crops.  Then the object made a sound.  It had a strange resemblance to a deisel engine.  This went on for exactly 32 minutes when the ships finally passed over.;36.2467;-93.1054
