I had just come home and noticed that the sky that evening, full of stars, was so beautiful and there was a lovely cool breeze, so I sat down in the doorway to take in the scene and relax. All of a sudden one of the stars began to slowly move horizontally across the sky. Not as slow as a satallite though. As the star moved across the top of the sky it's glow grew brighter until the glow was a nice bright but not blinding white with a slight golden hue. As it continued to move across the sky its light then began to dim until it was no longer visible. This all lasted maybe 3 to 5 minutes. The ufo was very high! Also the light was not bliking it was a nice slow turn from dim to bright to to dim to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.2467;-93.1054
