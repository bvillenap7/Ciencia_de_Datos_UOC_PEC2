I first thought it was helicopters then one disappeared and reappeared.  I was like mind blown.   I told my wife to come look.  She came outside to look and then we got in our car and started driving toward the lights which are now over the small airport and spread abroad but still close together.   At one point one just moved real fast across all of the others then they just started fading away.   My mind is totally blown.  Didn't believe much in this kind of stuff but tonight has me thinking different. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.2467;-93.1054
