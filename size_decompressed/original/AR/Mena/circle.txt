It was moving very slowly from N.W. toward E.. The background was a mountain. It made no sound. It was extremely windy and did not affect this object's movement. It was no more than 100 yards from me. It was about 3 stories from the ground. I went inside to get my car keys to follow it and could not find it.;34.5818;-94.2212
