Small silver object over Ward Arkansas.;2009-02-08 15:00:00;3 min.;Small silver object over Ward, Arkansas. I was outside today looking at the unusual number of planes that were leaving trails behind.  I wanted a closer look so I went and got binoculars and was looking to the South.  It was a clear blue sky except where the planes left trails behind them. I was looking at one of the plane trails when I saw a small silver object just below it.  I took my eyes from the binoculars for a moment to see if I could see it without them.  Didn't see it until I looked through the binoculars again. Called my husband out to see it but it was gone when he looked.  I never saw it again.   This is my first daylight sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above to February 08.
