Triangle in the North West sky.;2010-12-04 20:00:00;10 min.;Triangle in the North West sky. I looked out the back door as I always do to see if I see anything. I noticed a green,red,and white light flashing. I went and got camera took a picture of it.  It was in the low North West sky. I couldn't tell what it was until I took the picture.  It didn't move for about ten minutes.  Went back in to look at picture then decided to look again and it was gone. It looked like the same thing in the same area three nights before.;34.953;-91.8989
