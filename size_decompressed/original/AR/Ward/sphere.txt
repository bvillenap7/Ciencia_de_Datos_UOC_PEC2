Fire ball dropped straight from sky.;1999-04-16 20:50:00;6-10 seconds;Fire ball dropped straight from sky. We were traveling home when we saw a bright red flash that light up about 20% of the north east sky from our location. It traveled STRAIGHT down - no arc or angle to it - it was a straight as a telephone pole.  It started out with the red flash but was an oval shaped object first blue-green turning white as it dropped below the tree level.  There was no sound. It was as bright as 3 or 4 traffic lights about 1 block away and much larger than a military airplane.  We have no way to tell starting height nor distance from us. Both my wife and I have seen numerous meteors and shooting stars in the past - this was much different due to the direction of travel - the lack of an arc - again straight down. It lasted between 4 and 10 seconds - I say 6 - 10 seconds and my wife say 4 - 8 seconds. We had our CB radio on at the time and several truckers saw it as well from different angles - most agreed using the words fireball and straight down in their descriptions. There was no trail or after streak to the ball. I can not recieve collect calls here - but would gladly return a call to you so we are paying for the call.;34.953;-91.8989
