UFOs over Lake Ouachita seen from Navy Landing by two people with video and photo.;2018-07-20 21:20:00;3 minutes;ufos over Lake Ouachita seen from Navy Landing by two people with video and photo. Looking Southwest toward the moon from Navy Landing on Lake Ouachita, my husband and I saw a bright white object moving North northeast in the sky.  I began to video the object when my husband saw two other ones moving lower than the one on video moving in the opposite direction.  I continued to video the initial object until I was turned 90 degrees from the start of the videoing. My husband had full view of the two objects moving in the opposite direction for about 5 seconds.  We both had view of the videoed object for about 2 to 3 mins before it was out of sight.  I have video and a photo of the longest sbeen object.  Upon zooming in to the photo, more defined angles of shape of the object appearing to be the shape of a polygon.;34.7127;-93.0399
