((HOAX??))  An aircraft just appeared and stood still.;2009-11-18 20:54:00;30 sec.;As I was looking at the sky, when this aircraft just appeared and stood still I was looking at the sky when out of no where this aircraft just appeared. My son and I where driving on Highway 30-Arizona, about half a mile close to exit 30, the come up sign read HOPE...so i figured we sow this kind of diamond shaped aircraft near Hope County, Arizona. It was 9:55pm Eastern Time...but i believe in that area it was 7:55pm. it had on each corner a bar of bright white lights, which was turning on and off, the aircraft was big and black, it stood still. as we passed by, I still can watched from my right window but than it disappeared.
