a formation of five strange lights;2003-09-22 21:30:00;15 minutes;a formation of five strange lights My husband and I were driving out of Van Buren and into Ft smith when he pulled the van to a instant halt. He kept saying Oh my God!, Oh my God!. I asked what it was, and he said I see lights  He pulled over in a local elementary school parking lot and that is when I saw them too.  They were 5 lights that would illuminate brightly then fade out, then they pulled into a formation.  We kept looking at this for a few minutes,then we decided we had to have a closer look.  We drove down Hwy. 59 to get a better view, and all the while keeping our eyes on the lights.  Soon, we noticed that a couple of helicopters from ft. chaffee took off in pursuit. They seemed to be going around in circles, as if they were looking for something. Then what my husband identified as F-16 fighters took off next. They were chasing the lights in the sky. It was rather comical to watch because it seemed like a game of cat and mouse, but the strange lights were too fast to catch. We pulled into the lock and dam to watch this spectacle for a while, and soon there were no more strange lights in the sky.  The duration lasted for about an hour at that time.  When we returned home, my neighbor asked me if we had seen any strange lights, and of course we had.  Also, this morning on the radio on a dallas station, a caller had called in reporting what he had seen.  Apparently it was seen by a lot of people.
