He went in and got his digital movie camera with a 72 zoom we could see so much more. It was not a star or a plane, we captured it on video for over 20 minutes. I find it hard to describe and is best for anyone to see the tape. Then the next night we thought we would look in the same area, it wasn't quite dark but stars could be seen and there is was again right between the big dipper and the little dipper this time it let us see so much more, it changes shape from a dot to a huge ball, multicolored with greens, reds, blues and greys. This night it also change to a hour glass shaping with red (flame looking) all around it.My brothers camera allowed us to do a 360 zoom and what we saw was quite a show. You must see this video we have over 36 minutes on the second evening. Last night it stormed here so we saw nothing. In all my years I have never seen anything like this, years ago in Racheal Nevada I met a man by the name of Bob Lazar and thought he had some unusuall stories but this is caught on tape. Please call us, see this video 479-((telephone number deleted)) Thank You, ((name #1 deleted))  ((name #2 deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that celestial bodies would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness captured genuine UFO's on tape.  We will request a copy of the tape, or excerpts.  PD));35.3479212903226;-94.3875148387096
