My son and I were on the passenger side, ( front and back)and I had just commented to him how pretty the stars were this far from the city. We noticed there were a lot of planes in the sky and how they were flying so close together. Then 2 huge lights appeared. They were about 3 inches apart from each other and bright white. They were bigger than any of the stars and right in the middle of all the planes. Suddenly the light on the left became very bright and as big as a baseball, just as it started to fade the light on the right did the same thing. They did this back and forth about 3 times, then they both lit up and disappeared. We made my husband pull over and sat there looking at the sky for about 15 minutes before he lost patients and wanted to leave. If it were up to me and my son we would have sat there all night. It was truley amazing and something we will never forget!;35.3479212903226;-94.3875148387096
Bright white round light ball, no Nav lights, no sound from the craft and not a meteor too clow for that.;2012-08-05 22:00:00;1 minute;Bright white round light ball, no Nav lights, no sound from the craft and not a meteor too clow for that. Around 10:00 pm. I was looking through my telescope with my grandson. From the southern sky a bright white object moved to  the northeast at a high rate of speed. I was just able to get in my 6&quot telescope for a 10 seconds. The light was perfectly round about the size of a disco ball with a very bright light, and no Nav lights, just a white ball of light.  No sound at all with this object, I thought it was a star but the object moved across the sky from south to Northeast out of view in a 1  minute or longer, not a meteor this slow and no trailing light. It took a good minute or so to cross the full sky.  Most high altitude jets take two  or three minutes to move overhead and out of view. I checked Satellite and ISS tracking and none of them have an orbit path from south to a northeast.;35.3479212903226;-94.3875148387096
