quivering flashing object high and distant in the Northeast sky ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.  PD));2003-10-24 02:29:00;for an hour now;quivering flashing object high and distant in the Northeast sky In the sky northeast of Fort Smith a long distance I am seeing a bright light high in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but then I noticed it appears to be moving slightly from side to side. I got my binoculars and could see it is flashing with a red light being emitted. It appears to be dragging something, though I really can't see the shape. It is not round like a star and it quivers. I generally do not believe in UFO's, but this thing sure doesn't look or act like a star. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star may have been the cause of the sighting.
