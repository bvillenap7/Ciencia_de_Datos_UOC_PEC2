I noticed what appeared to be a star and just watched it for a moment.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2010-03-05 03:00:00;1 hour;I noticed what appeared to be a star and just watched it for a moment and then it began to have white lights randomly flash around it.  I was only watching with the naked eye. It was fairly stationary and was still visible when I came in to report this.  I saw it through a double paned window so I thought it might be a trick of my eye glasses and the window so I went outside and the same strange random lights flashed around it.  As I write this I rechecked to see if it was still visible and the random lights continue and it is 3:55 AM.;35.3479212903226;-94.3875148387096
Beehive shaped object seen above the Arkansas river;2013-09-13 19:05:00;3 minutes;Beehive shaped object seen above the Arkansas river On September 13, 2013, I was in the car with my mother around 7:05 pm, when we were heading down the road towards our home. I happened to look up towards the sky through the passenger window of the car. I noticed a object in the sky which I believed was a falling meteorite at the time. I watched this meteorite for 3 minutes. The object started in a downward path in the sky with a flame tail, which made me believe it was a falling meteorite. As it was heading down towards earth, it literally stop all movement in the sky and stood still for less than a minute. It was like the object was watching me watching it. The next thing I know, it shot up vertically and it was rotating. The object suddenly disappeared out of the sky. When the object stood still in the sky, I was able to observe the shape of it as a large upside down beehive. The object was really smooth and shiny looking. The color of the object was like a peachy seashell color. The object was so large I could tell that it had a glassy metal exterior where it was possible that occupants could see through it but nobody from the outside could look in. When the object sped off vertically it looked like a spinning top.;35.3479212903226;-94.3875148387096
