Orange fireball;2011-07-04 22:00:00;3 min;orange fireball Myself and one other person were packing up after a firework show when we noticed an orange glowing orb in the distance. we joked it was an a firework that forgot to explode.   there was no sound and no flashing lights like i would expect on any kind of aircraft.   it was slowly moving horizontally north to south and appeared to almost stop after moving a good distance.  it seemed to hover for a few seconds and then began moving straight up very quickly and disappeared.;35.3479212903226;-94.3875148387096
