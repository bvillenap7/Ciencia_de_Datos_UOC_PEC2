Bright Light with Tail in Ft Smith Night Sky;2001-09-17 21:00:00;15 minute;Bright Light with Tail in Ft Smith Night Sky We were driving west on I-40 to Oklahoma.  The moon was almost setting.  My son pointed out a bright light in the sky. It looked like an airplane at first a very bright one. Then we saw an airplane pass under two very different things. I thought it might be a satellite burning out through the atmosphere. It had a tail with a bright end.  It sloped up from bottom left to top right. As dusk came closer, the tail continued to grow.  It kept the same position in the sky left and right, that is.  The tail then split into two distinct trails. The only way to attempt to describe the length was if you extend your arm all the way the tail was about one inch long way up in the sky.  Other cars were watching the same thing.  We could see them looking up, too.  As night fell, it disappeared.  I am not into UFOs or anything.  This was either a rocket going up, a satellite burning through, or an UFO.;35.3479212903226;-94.3875148387096
