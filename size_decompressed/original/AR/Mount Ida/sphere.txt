I was working outside hanging up holiday decorations.  I always look up at the sky because there is often aerial spraying going on...I like to keep my eyes on the sky.   I was moving a ladder into place and looked up at the sky...saw 5-6 small white spherical lights dancing around in the sky close together -- they were way above a few birds flying around in the wind underneath of the spheres.   I yelled for my husband to come see them. I probably observed them for 10 seconds.  I kept my eye on the sky where the spheres were.  After I yelled, the spheres seemed to fade away -- I kept watching to see if they may have disappeared behind an invisible cloud.  I never saw them again after they faded away.;34.5627;-93.5725
