June 7th, 2008 me, my son 15 and my brother were on lake quachita in Hot Springs, AR.  We were at Mountain Harbor Resort.  We all three decided to go for a late night boat ride and swim.  we got through swimming and was looking up at the stars on the party barge at around 10:30 we saw an object that looked like a satelite come across us in space.  we were in the middle of the lake straight out from mountain harbor. this object however came over us three different times in different directions.  we then knew it was no satelite. Then we saw three objects moving in formation. It was a perfect triangle in space all moving together.  I could not see anything behind the object so I dont know if it was one huge object or 3 seperate objects however they dissapeared and by that time my son and my brother were eager to get off the lake and on to shore. It was kind of spooky.;34.5627;-93.5725
