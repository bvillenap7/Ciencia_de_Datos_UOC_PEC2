trail of multiple lights in the sky moving in formation.((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-15 16:30:00;4 minutes;trail of multiple lights in the sky moving in formation. Observed at least 25 or more dimly lit craft at a great range out. Multiple people were around and observed this.  The craft were evenly spaced out in a line stretching nearly from horizon to horizon.  They were perfectly spaced out and traveling at the same great speeds in formation.  The flight came out of the South West and was headed north east. I am curious if this was the Starlink Satellites or not?;36.2672;-90.2702
