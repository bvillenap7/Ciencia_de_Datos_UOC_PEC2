three flying objects going fast in the sky in the middle of the day.;2004-04-16 11:00:00;7min;three flying objects going fast in the sky in the middle of the day. 2 ships came first with one following them about 10 seconds behind it. it could have been a cigar shape or a side view of a disk shape. when we tried to focus on it , it seemed to distort. it reminded me and looked like the armor that the alien on the movie predator  wore  or like it was made of mirror material.  it had no sound and no trails of anything.  it was a clear day and nice blue skys. and they were high up in the sky and went straight across the sky. we were building a deck on a second story and my friend was on the steps below me looking up to talk to me when he saw the first two.
