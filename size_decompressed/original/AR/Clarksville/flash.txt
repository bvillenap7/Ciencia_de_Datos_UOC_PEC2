Brilliant flash of blueish/white light that illuminated the entire area;2013-09-04 01:00:00;1 second;Brilliant flash of blueish/white light that illuminated the entire area I was fishing, sitting back in my chair, changing the song on my iPhone when suddenly a brilliant blueish/white explosion of light illuminated the entire area. I look up just quick enough to catch a glance of what is very hard to describe with certainty because it happened so fast, but what I can say for fact is that whatever caused this flash was very close to me about 20 yards in front of me and about 50 yards above the water. Literally almost over head. What I recall once I looked at the source was a blueish/white light with a bit of a tail, sort of like a spade, but the tail wasn't as acute. Also, the spade of light was slightly split in the middle by a blue streak. This light source/spade was about 20 yards wide and 30 yards long.  I imagine this phenomenon was a craft exploding into acceleration and what I saw was the propulsion like that from a modern rocket ship. Except this was light not fire. And it made no noise at all, that's the most unbelievable part to me, being as close as I was.  I don't believe I was abducted because there was no loss of time or bodily marks and such. Not even feelings of fear or unease. Although this was my first of three verified sightings/encounters in a month. This flash, & 2 separate orange circle/orb sightings that can be nothing other than extra terrestrial. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
