Two greys spotted near caddo river (perhaps doing ground survey?)  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a serious report.  PD));2008-06-16 11:00:00;60 seconds;Two greys spotted near caddo river (perhaps doing ground survey?)   My wife and I were floating the caddo River in a canoe. Approximately one mile down from the dam. I observed two Greys standing in a clearing in the woods. One was facing away from me (West). The other Facing North. They were hudled together as if looking at something one of them were holding in hand. They were approximately 5'6 tall. They were a pastey light greyish white with a yellow hue to their skin. They were not wearing clothing of any kind. When I saw them I decided not to investigate as this is usually what gets people abducted. My wife asked me what I was looking at and why I looked so shocked. I didnt tell her anything. She is a loud mouth and would have drawn attention to us if Id let her see them. The greys had Very large heads. They had a crease that ran from the forhead all the way back down to the back of the neck. Like two lobes. They were frail and I could see their   Spinal column and ribs. The weather was clear and sunny. Excelent visability. It had rained the night before and earily that morning. I only wish Id had my gun with me. I would have shot the two of them and stole their spaceship. That is, If it was even on the ground. I dont know, I didnt see one from where I was. There was a neighborhood  just down river of the sighting area. Maybe a 1/4 mile. For anyone that might want to go check the area with a gaigercounter. or somthing.
