Intense white spherical flash above a full rainbow. UNREAL.;2016-04-14 18:15:00;300 milliseconds;Intense white spherical flash above a full rainbow.  UNREAL I was standing on my deck at around 6:15 pm with a neighbor talking as we admired a perfect rainbow that had formed to our east. As we were talking looking at the rainbow suddenly from nowhere appeared a bright white spherical flash that was of great intensity.  This flash was a sphere with flared edges and maybe the diameter of a 1/3 full moon.  The flash of white light appeared to have lasted for maybe 300 milliseconds.  Just long enough to get a clear view.  It was so intense that had the duration lasted longer you couldn't stare at it.  Very similar to the intensity of the sun, except being smaller and of a pure white color.  I have never seen anything supernatural in my life and I am a bit shaken at the moment.  I stared at the spot in the sky until almost sunset hoping it would reappear, but it never did.  3 mins after this occurred I went inside to grab my iPad and I snapped 2 images of the rainbow.  Now that I have reviewed the two images, I can see a black object near where the flash occurred.  I will never forget this until the day I die and I now know 100% that there is an unexplained phenomena happening around us and I need answers.  It was simply incredible.;34.6014;-90.7499
