So I went outside to check, and about 2-300 yards away, I noticed a bright light flickering right above the tree line.  Like a orange color with blue in it.  It stayed there for awhile then it dimmed and started moving.  It went good distance then became bright again.  I called the neighbor to have him look, and they told me they witnessed it a few days before, as well.  After approx. 20 min., it slowly dimmed and floated away.   I have spoke to a few more neighbors and they too have encountered the UFO.  I also witnessed a smaller object reminded me of car headlight but dimmer floating across the area several times.  Stopping and going.  Never landing;34.3861;-93.3864
