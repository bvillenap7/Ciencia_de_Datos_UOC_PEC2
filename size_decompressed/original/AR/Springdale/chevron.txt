Chevron shape with an extra bend on each end, dark and completely silent.;2013-11-07 22:30:00;10 seconds;Chevron shape with an extra bend on each end, dark and completely silent. I was walking my dog before bed.  The night sky was very clear.  I saw movement in the sky traveling from north to south.  It was chevron shaped with a little extra bend on both sides and my first thought was a group of geese, but there was no sound and the shape was too perfect.   There were no lights but there were contrasting spots that were either darker or lighter that made me think of geese.  It moved faster than geese would fly at that height..  Not sure of the height.  Maybe about the height of a small engine plane.  It seemed fairly low. It was completely silent.;36.1786930232558;-94.1110589147285
