Big gray mass fly very fast across entire sky.;2011-10-16 22:30:00;1 min;Big gray mass fly very fast across entire sky. I was standing out on a golf course in the middle of springdale AR.  It was about 10:30 at night. Even though there was quite a bit of light pollution you could still see some stars.  i was trying to find constalations snd such when a big gray mass darted accross the sky like a shooting star except it was closer to earth and there was no light coming from it.  i watched it fly from one end of the sky to the other. it  was probably the fastest thing i'v ever saw.
