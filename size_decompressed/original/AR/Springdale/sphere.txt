Metallic sphere over Arkansas.;2013-09-03 16:30:00;2 minutes;Metallic sphere over Arkansas I was driving home alone the highway and happened to glance upwards into the sky. Immediately a distinct metallic glint caught my eye.  Luckily, traffic moved slowly, and I was able to look at the object several times. It remained hovering in one spot, and looked to be at an altitude lower than an airplane, perhaps 500ft above normal helicopter altitude.  The object was completely spherical, and clear enough in the daylight to be clearly distinguishable as a smooth object. It remained unmoving until the fifth time I looked at it, when I watched it apparently vanish, though gradually, as if it were dissolving into the air.  As it vanished, the atmosphere around it became blurred, as if viewed thorough a heat haze.;36.1786930232558;-94.1110589147285
