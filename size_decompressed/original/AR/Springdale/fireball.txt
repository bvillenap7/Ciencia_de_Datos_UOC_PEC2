Fleet of orange lights;2013-06-27 22:50:00;2 minutes;Fleet of orange lights Looking South down near horizon I see 3 orange lights traveling east.  My best guess is they were traveling close to and on track with I-40.   I could see each light for about 25 seconds before it disappeared.   It seemed they traveled in groups of 3 at different intervals.  They looked like a battery of missiles was set off, all coming from one spot (from my perception)   Some sped ahead of others while the others kept a cruising speed.;36.1786930232558;-94.1110589147285
