black  chevron with at least 5 amber colored lights.;2006-12-10 20:00:00;30 seconds;black  chevron with at least 5 amber colored lights. On December 10, 2006 at approximately 8 p.m.,while riding in a church bus on HWY. 63 North, I spotted a bright light in the northwest.  At first I thought it was a star or planet, but then it was coming closer.  My husband, who was seated next to me, saw the bright light,also.  The light was now parallel to the highway. From my seat by the window, I could see the object it was a black (or dark colored) chevron with at least 5 large amber-colored lights on the underside. The object looked to be rather large. With no lights on its wings like the conventional aircraft, I thought perhaps it was a military craft.  As far as my background, I work at a public school.;35.5357;-90.4187
