Power went off at approximately 4:20 AM.  I went outside and observed two craft.  One stationary object that would move a few inches then hover.  It was a few times larger than the largest star in the sky.   The other u.f.o.(s) had three lights that did not stay in constant relation to each other and they moved erratically then moved off and disappeared. The first single object continuted to hover them move a few inches in different directions for about ten minutes.  Then the other three u.f.o.s returned from the same direction they left to.  All four then just vanished in an instant. During this event we saw a bright flash of light over our town that lasted about 2 seconds when the second u.f.o(s) returned.;35.5357;-90.4187
