I don't know what it is, but it has had the same characteristics both times. Last thursday (yes, the night of the jennings special) I spotted a vehicle in the air, lower down, and stay stationary in the sky. White lights and red lights alternating blinking. I tried to take a pic with my camera phone, but the photos didnt come out well (damn sony ericsson phone). Tonight, same object, about 30 min from where I originally saw it last week, this time I pulled over to try to snap a pic with the camera phone, but could not even get it to show up on my camera for some reason (even with night mode on). It was just stationary in the sky. I sit there and attempted to take two pics (which neither picked it up) and then it just whizzed away, not blink of an eye fast, but faster than most planes I've seen.  Freaked me out both times, enough where my back was sweating this last time. I almost wanted to run up to somebody and tell them to look at it (was pulled out by a gas station) but in Arkansas, I figured I would be attacked for being a nut or something (my wife even thinks im going crazy).  I've seen one a long time ago, totally different, but something is going on down here right now, 2 in two weeks is just insane.;35.5357;-90.4187
