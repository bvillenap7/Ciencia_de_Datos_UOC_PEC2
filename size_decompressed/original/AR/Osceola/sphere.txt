Silver sphere changes to translucent then shot vertical into atmosphere;2019-10-16 10:35:00;30 seconds;Silver sphere changes to translucent then shot vertical into atmosphere I am a superintendent for a steel erection company. I was watching my men working on the roof of a 45ft tall building when my eyes were drawn to an object silver in color moving from north towards the south at a steady rate of speed. No contrail was behind this object so my curiosity was peaked, it appeared to be about 15miles away. I pulled out my phone to take a picture of it. It changed from silver to translucent then immediately shot up in the atmosphere out of sight.;35.7017;-89.9887
