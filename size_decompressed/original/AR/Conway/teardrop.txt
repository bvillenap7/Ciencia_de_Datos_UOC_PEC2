Huge teardrop light followed by a distant boom (gun shot sounding, but bigger and too far away).;2011-10-08 21:40:00;1 sec;huge teardrop light followed by a distant boom (gun shot sounding, but bigger and too far away). i was smoking a cig outside with my dog trip when i looked up to see a teardrop shapped light appear and disapear within a second. It was the biggest light I've ever seen.   Soon after it disappeared I hear what sounded like a distant gunshot, or sonic boom. feaking amazed me!!
