With either red writing or red lights on the side. I saw the object streak by. I was 12 years old at the time and thought I had just seen a rocket fly over. I started to run in to the house to tell my mother of the amazing thing I just saw. When I heard the rumbling once more. But this time it was an F-15, Flying west to east. Just above the treeline. And in the same direction of the object.;35.0834352112676;-92.4455915492959

At one point it disintegrated and then reappeared.   One of the stranger parts of this event was when the lightning struck very bright there appears to be chains between our vehicle and the flying objects above us directly above us that were not visible to the naked eye.  We were not aware of this happening until we got home and looked at the video footage.   I set my phone on the dashboard facing upward so it would catch the Storm and The Lightning, I had no idea there was an object hovering directly above us until we got home and saw the footage.;35.0834352112676;-92.4455915492959
