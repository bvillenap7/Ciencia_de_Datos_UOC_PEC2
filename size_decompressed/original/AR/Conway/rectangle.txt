Hovering craft seen on Hendrix's campus.   I was walking to an academic building, when I looked up and thought I saw an airplane passing by, but quickly realized that the aircraft or like thing was stationary in the sky.   I saw it sitting very low in the sky with blinking lights.  It sat there for about five minutes,  turned off its lights and seemed to blend in and disappear but then released some sort of gas like substance and made a strange whirling got sound.  It then moved a little to a different part of campus and flashed lights and then disappeared.  Other people on my campus saw this and pointed it out.;35.0834352112676;-92.4455915492959
