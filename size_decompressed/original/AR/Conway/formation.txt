Four round, grayish balls flying in a triangular formation, broad daylight, no sound, moving quickly;2011-02-15 12:00:00;few minutes;four round, grayish balls flying in a triangular formation, broad daylight, no sound, moving quickly In a mall parking lot I noticed two other people looking into the sky and saying what is that?  I looked up and saw four round, grayish balls in a triangular formation, flying together, not as high as a commercial plane, more like the height of a private aircraft, and moving away from me quickly.  There was no sound, no lights and was definately not like any aircraft I have ever seen.  I am a well educated medical professional and this is no joke.
