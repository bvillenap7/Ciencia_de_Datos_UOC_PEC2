Circle of steady, white light seen near Conway, AR.;2013-04-25 20:30:00;1-2 minutes;Circle of steady, white light seen near Conway, AR. My roommate and I watched some kind of UFO fly over our house. It flew slowly, and there are almost no clouds in the sky, so we could see it pretty clearly. It took 10-20 seconds to go behind the tree next to the house, then another 30-60 to disappear into the cloud-haze on the horizon on the other side (moving NE to SW, toward the city). It wasn’t blinking like the normal aircraft we get flying over (we’re in a military flight training path), and it made no noise.  It also flew in a really erratic way, always tending to the SW but zig-zagging a little. We both commented that it looked “wobbly.”  It was just a steady, round, bright white light with what appeared to be some kind of mist or haze around it. We could see the stars around it clearly, but this light looked foggy, even though it was large and not behind any clouds. Less than 2 minutes later, two helicopters flew over. One came from the NE, almost along the path the UFO took, and the other came from somewhere to the west.  It was just over the horizon, behind the hill, and I couldn’t see it for more than a couple of seconds at a time.  Both were flying really low, really fast, and they appeared to converge on the area where we’d last seen the light.  Although the UFO had disappeared into the clouds, we were able to see the blinking lights from the helicopters until they flew behind tree cover.;35.0834352112676;-92.4455915492959
Three alternating bright lights;2017-10-24 20:45:00;5 minutes;Three alternating bright lights Three separate circles of bright lights that alternated lighting up.  Changed location and formation quickly.  Very bright. Looked like a streetlight up in the sky.  Planes were crossing the sky and they looked like ants compared to these lights.  Then suddenly they disappeared.   I attempted a video but it did not work.;35.0834352112676;-92.4455915492959
