I-40 westbound between Minefee and Conway, AR.  Followed tree top blinking lights for 5 to 10 minutes.;2008-01-13 21:00:00;10 minutes;I-40 westbound between Minefee and Conway, AR.  Followed tree top blinking lights for 5 to 10 minutes. Use the Google Map at this URL for reference... http://tinyurl.com/conwayarufo  You can use the Google Map Street View feature to see the terrain and understand my view that night.  I was heading east bound on I-40 at about 9PM CST on a clear night with star filled sky.  East of Menifee and west of Conway, AR, (Point A on Google Map) I noticed blinking green and red lights 2 or 3 miles ahead and on the right, just above tree tops.  My first reaction was a new tower had been installed (on a clear night you can see blinking red lights for miles from radio and cellular towers), but within 30 seconds, it was apparent that it wasn't a tower because it was moving, slowly, but it was moving.  As I got closer, (Point B on Google Map) I slowed down to 20 or 30 mph and rolled my passenger window down.  There was no traffic behind me, but there were a few cars passing on the other side of the interstate going west bound.  As I slowed, the object passed just above tree top some 50 yards south of my position right out my passenger window, approximately between hwy 64 and I-40 just west of what is exit 124 now.  Exit 124 was not open at the time, still under construction.  As low, slow and close as the object was, I could not make out any shape at all.  The only visible parts were 3 lights, alternating between red-green-blue.  The object was moving west, north west at about 20 mph no more than 5 feet above the tree tops.  I could not hear any sound from the object at all.  I accelerated, took exit 125 off of I-40, 1 mile down the interstate, onto hwy 64 heading west (point C and D on Google Map).  I again saw the object north west of my position about 2 miles away still traveling west by north west.  By the time I got back to my position parallel to I40 where I had slowed down (point E on map), a 2 mile round trip, the object had crossed over the interstate and was continuing it's path right at tree top, slightly faster now.  I would guess the object was traveling at 50mph now on a slightly more north bound path than before.  As I traveled west on hwy 64 for another 3 or 4 miles.  The object was still in sight, but was steadily getting further away, mostly increasing distance west but also north.  I was traveling at 65 or 70 on hwy 64 West bound, so the object had to have increased it's speed to something above that.  When I turned off of hwy 64 at Hogan Ln, (point F on map) the object was 3 or 4 miles north west of my position and was still visible, though the line of sight was intermittent.   The object at this point was roughly a mile north of the interstate and 3 or 4 miles west.  Upon reflection, I have to rule out an ultralight craft for 3 reasons.  First, it was an absolutely pitch black night, with no moon at all.  Flying an ultralight at treetop height would have been suicide.  Second, as I passed within 50 yards of the object, with my window directly facing it open, it made no sound.  I've been around ultralights enough to know what they sound like and at that distance, I would have clearly heard the motor.  Third, the variety of speed the object was flying at was outside the parameters of an ultralight.  The object was at times traveling at no more than 20mph and at other times well above 70.  When I see ultralights flying around C. Arkansas, they're typically flying at about 30-40 mph.;35.0834352112676;-92.4455915492959
5 red-orange orbs in formation flew close-by but made no sound.;2012-05-13 21:13:00;3 minutes;5 red-orange orbs in formation flew close-by but made no sound. I was backing out of my drive onto a road that runs north-south through Conway, AR, and while looking to my right (south) to check for traffic I noticed a string of lights similar to how flares may appear, or aircraft in very close formation flight, but these were red lights, were bright, were constant, and were too large to be aircraft lights without their being heard.  As I watched them the arc formation of lights began to shift closer to one another.  There were 4 lights that moved close together forming a diamond momentarily (indicative of a helicopter or aircraft losing altitude rapidly in formation flight) and one additional light nearer (higher on the horizon). They changed their formation while moving north, toward me.  At this point I was out of my car and walking toward the lights, south along the street. The way the lights changed formation they appeared to hover and move slowly as a helicopter might, but there were no white anti-collision lights.  Al! l of the lights were a bright red with a slight tinge of orange and after the movement of the lights occurred some began to grow dim.  As I walked closer I expected they would soon pass directly overhead or nearby, but by the time I reached a tall group of pines that were obscuring my view all of the lights had vanished. I am a former Army helicopter pilot, Chief Warrant Officer (retired 2007), and what I saw does not make sense. Because of the size of the lights I should have been able to hear the aircraft, were they rotor or fixed wing, but I heard nothing. It was a cloudless night sky as many stars shone brightly surrounding the area where I viewed the lights. After walking back to my car I immediately looked at the clock and it showed 2118hrs. I estimated it took me about 5 minutes to walk to the spot where I realized the lights had vanished and return to my vehicle.;35.0834352112676;-92.4455915492959
Four solid orange UFO's flying over the night sky.;2013-07-04 22:18:00;5 minutes;Four solid orange UFO's flying over the night sky. My friends and I were out in the courtyard, finishing the night celebrating Independence Day.  (The day before we had only seen one on what I'll describe next),   I pointed up to my roommate and said, look!  My fellow neighbors and I all looked up, there was one orange solid light.   Behind it came another orange solid light, then two more. We watched as the UFO's came from behind each other to move into formation.   They then proceeded to move forward. Out of no where they all of a sudden shot up and winked out.;35.0834352112676;-92.4455915492959
