on my way home, july23 2004 i followed a glowing light  to my driveway.;2004-07-23 00:00:00;20 min.;on my way home, july 23 2004 i followed a glowing light  to my driveway. well first, I was coming home from work. i work night shift, as i was driving i seen a bright light come up out of a soybean field, at first it just shot up about 100 feet, an just stayed there for a few sec. it supprised me, so i stoped my truck an jumped out, to get a better look at it.then it.  at first it looked like a star.   with what looked like a cross in the middle of it, real bright, but not enough to hurt my eyes.it was about the size of my truck, then it started moving east.on a straight line.  so i got back in my truck an followed it. lucky for me i guess it was going the same direction as my house was.  so when i was coming up to my driveway, i seen my oldest son was outside,  so i stoped again an shouted at him to come an look at this thing.  so as he came up to me i pointed up at this thing an as soon as i looke up it seemed to change shape. at the same time my son said im going to get the camera, that he has in his truck to take pic. of some fish he had caught the night before, as he was running to get the camera it all of a sudden took off so fast i lost it in my vision, but i was able to spot it again completly on the other side of the sky, by then my son was there with the camera an started taking pictures. as he was doing that it all of a sudden shot down  to allmost to the top of the trees, an changed shape, towhat looked like a soft light not perfect round or even with any shape at all just changing.he was able to take 9 pic. of the object, but for some reason only 1 showed up at all, i no this dont show just what we seen but does show something anyway.
