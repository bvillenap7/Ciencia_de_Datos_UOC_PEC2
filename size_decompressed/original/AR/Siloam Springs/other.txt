At ten thirty-five on the night of november tenth I witnessed what i believe to be a UFO.  It came towards my house from the southwest moving very slowly.  It was as bright as a street light but high up in the sky, though much lower than any airplane.  It had the color of fire and seemed round, though as it got closer it seemed to have two smaller lights on either side of it.  As it got closer to my house, about the time it was over the high school which is a block away, it made a sharp, quick turn to the east and shot off very fast in that direction.  When it was shooting away I noticed that the three lights were one solid object with strobing white lights on the back. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above.
