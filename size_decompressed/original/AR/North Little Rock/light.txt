Linear blinking bright rectangular lights in N/NE sky;2019-10-24 20:00:00;5 minutes;Linear blinking bright rectangular lights in N/NE sky N/NE direction, just above the tree line, My daughter and I were driving east when we witnessed a line of bright lights, rectangular shaped, alternately blinking.  Bright and sharp like LEDs with hints of color.  Seemed to be decending but not clear about that since we were driving. Lights were in perfect line, so we assumed they were part of one long craft.;34.8032115384616;-92.2357230769232
