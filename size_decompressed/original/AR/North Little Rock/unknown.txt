After the light beam had passed, I saw an object traveling through the sky at a high rate of speed.  At first, I thought it was a satellite passing over, but then realized that it was moving to fast for that. I watched it for about five seconds, and then was shocked to see it make a hard turn to the right, a 90 degree turn and then a second 90 degree turn so that it was heading back towards me. It then started moving back in the original direction, with no noticeable turn made.  It was out of sight within a matter of seconds.  There were no other witnesses to this.;34.8032115384616;-92.2357230769232

It looked like a satellite moving across the sky but brighter.  It flew above my house. I took a picture.  Zoomed in on picture and it those not look like any satellite, ISS or aircraft I have ever seen.  It did not have Nav lights and looked like it was orbiting earth.  Moved southeast fast.;34.8032115384616;-92.2357230769232
