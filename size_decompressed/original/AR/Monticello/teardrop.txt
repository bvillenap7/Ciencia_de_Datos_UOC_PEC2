They came one at a time from over the City of Monticello and were traveling in a northerly direction, then each changed direction to the west.   Each light was visible for about 3 to 5 minutes.   They bobbled in the air as they changed direction from northerly to westerly, and really picked up speed and were out of sight in a minute or so.
