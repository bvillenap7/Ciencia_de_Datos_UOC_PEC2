Silent huge triangular ship flies right over highway 65 North.;1987-10-31 18:30:00;15 minutes;Silent huge triangular ship flies right over highway 65 North. My mom & I were driving from Harrison AR. to Springfield, MO.  My niece had just been transported there a day after she was born.   I was driving on Highway 65 North almost to Omaha, AR.  It was a nice night and I had my sun roof open.  I was watching the traffic when I noticed that the traffic was slowing down.  I was asking my mom if she could see the reason for the traffic slowing down?   Now I can't really remember who said, Look at that flying over the mountain!  We were just in awe of what we were seeing.  Now, the traffic coming and going from the state line had come to a complete stop!  An airship, dark gray in color, shape like a triangle, was flying over the mountain with a white light from the center as if it was scanning the country side, searching for something.  It was like 3 football fields wide as well as long.   As it was flying above us very slowly, there was NO noise coming from it.  We were amazed as we were looking at it thru th! e sunroof.  My mom was commenting on how low it was flying.  It was solid!  It looked too amazing to be true.   The light that was searching the mountain & field turned off right before the light got to the highway.  We sat there just watching it.  There was NO noise at all when it flew over us!   Everybody just sat there & watched it until it flew out of sight!   That night will forever be ingrained in us!  We believe!:);36.4648;-93.1865
