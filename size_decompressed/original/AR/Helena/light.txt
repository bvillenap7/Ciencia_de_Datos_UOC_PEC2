INCREDIBLE SIGHTING WITH IMAGES;2017-02-01 15:00:00;Unknown;INCREDIBLE SIGHTING WITH IMAGES These pictures were taken by my cousin about 2-3 weeks ago.  I do not know the exact date or time, as I am just now getting the pictures from him and didn't ask those questions.  They were taken near the Helena, AR, industrial harbor.  They are the most incredible images that I have ever seen and I know that they are 100% authentic.  My cousin can barely use a cell phone.  They are real images period.  You can see the object in motion and there is no way that it is lens flare.  Just look at the telephone pole on the zoomed in photo.  It looks illuminated to me.  Even at a distance it retains the same visible characteristics.  I believe that this phenomenon is occurring frequently here and is able to be captured and analyzed.   Back in April I had a very similar experience, the first of my life which I reported here.;34.5308;-90.6331
