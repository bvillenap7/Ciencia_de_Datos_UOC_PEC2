UFO OVER KING BISCUIT BLUES FESTIVAL 10-9-15.;2015-10-07 21:00:00;4-5 minutes;UFO OVER KING BISCUIT BLUES FESTIVAL 10-9-15 At approximately 9:00 Pm I was standing on stage at the king biscuit blues fest in Helena, at about to go play along with 4-5 other musicians and looking south at approximately 5,000 ft altitude was a large orange light that appeared to be on fire.  The outer edges of the object had the appearance of a whipping flame.  There were several people who captured it on video with their cell ph, but because I had to go on stage and play, I never found out who shot the video.   Idk how many people in the audience witnessed this, but it had to be into the hundreds as the audience consisted of about 1000 people.  It looked sort of like a Chinese lantern except it couldn't have been because as I stated the edges of the object were like a whipping flame.  It was simply incredible and I wish I would of had more time to study it.   If anyone reading this happened to get video of this please post the video to YouTube. It was so bizarre and there was a group of us that was completely mesmerized by this and looking at it none of us could explain what it was we were looking at.;34.5308;-90.6331
