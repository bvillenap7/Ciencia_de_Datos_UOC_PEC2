Sphere with rows of windows Madison County, Arkansas 1982 or 1983;1983-06-01 23:00:00;5 minutes;Sphere with rows of windows Madison County, Arkansas 1982 or 1983 While driving on Arkansas Highway 68 north toward Alpena I observed an UFO.  It was between 10:30 and 11:00 PM, and I do not recall what the night sky was like as to clouds or moon.  This stretch of highway is very rural with few farms and homes.  The road is winding and the countryside hilly.   I noticed that the embankment along the road was getting brighter and thought that it was strange how bright my headlights had become.  I looked up and saw approaching from the east/southeast and to the right in my windshield an UFO.   This UFO appeared about twice the size of a full moon.  The object was spherical with 6 rows of oval or elliptical windows 3 rows above and 3 rows below an imaginary horizontal center line.  The light glowing from within was a butterscotch yellow color.   At approximately 2 o'clock and 8 o'clock as if on a clock face there were two protrusions that resembled bolts of lightning.  At each bend in the 'lightning bolt' there was a blinking white light.  Each light blinked on and off in succession on each side of the craft.   I slowed down but continued driving and after going about 1/4 mile the UFO had completely dissappeared.  The flight direction was southeast to northwest.  There was no sound emitted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.3024;-93.2776
