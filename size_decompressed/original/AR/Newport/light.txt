moving light in the sky;2016-09-27 05:30:00;5 seconds;moving light in the sky At about around 5:30 am on 9/27/2016 i had notice a rather strange light in the sky,  as soon as i noticed it started moving towards the east from where i was looking as if it had notice me see it.  I have witness several other times strange lights moving in the sky as well in the early mornings and have failed to report them.  They seem to just fade out as if it started to move either east or going straight up or turning off a light.  I know this couldn’t be an airplane because it would have the standard blinking lights and it was not cloudy outside as i could see the stars around this particular light i seen when it vanished,  It wasn’t a meteor because this thing didn't fall towards the ground it just moved a bit and the light on what i have seen just faded out.;35.5974;-91.2534
