My two neighbors and I went out to walk at 5:30 am. It was still very dark. My neighbor told us to look up, that there was something in the sky. It looked like a comet,a bright light with a dimmer tail, but the tail was wider. At the end of the tail was another bright light, smaller than the one in front. It moved east quickly, stopped and hovered for several seconds, then moved quickly out of sight.  My son and a friend spotted a similar object on 11/10/03 at approximately 7:30 pm. They came inside and told the adults to come outside to see the object. It was witnessed by two 11 year old boys and three adults. The object that night was more hazy, with a glowing appearance and moved more slowly at an even pace.;33.6791;-94.1325
