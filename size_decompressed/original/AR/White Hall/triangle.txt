It look as if it was slowing down to land near us when at least 6 F16 jets came from the east west and the north sky and started to chase the ufo. And just as they were getting close to it it shot back into the air and started moveing toward northeast and went over the oak trees in my front yard i then ran to the end of my drive way to see the where the ufo was headed and watched as the ufo took off with such a high speed that it was gone leaveing the f16 jets in its dust. It was an awesome sight to see this thing move .i was amazed to say the least. after it was gone i counted at least 10 to 15 jets going each direction in the sky looking for this thing for about 20 mins after it was seen. all the dogs in the neighborhood were barking like crazy for a while after the ufo took off from view.;34.273;-92.0859
