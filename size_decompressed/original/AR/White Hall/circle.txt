When the object noticed that we where outside watching it moved closer up till we went in and watched from there.;2012-12-18 03:00:00;NOTICE TILL DAYBREAK;when the object noticed that we where outside watching it moved closer up till we went in and watched from there around the three a clock hour my girlfriend notice that there was a bright star that seemed to be moving towards the north by northwest.  it was bright white with a blueish tint to it. as we watched this, we noticed that there was another one not as bright but alot closer to the ground.  the object got bigger so i concluded that it to was heading towards our direction. there were several planes that flew near and around it. by the time the sun was coming up more &quotstars&quot began to show. must have been there but never moved till then.  my first idea about this was the local goverenments uavs so i would like your input and knowledge on this to either debunk or prove my discovery. this is not the first sighting it has been a frequent vistor.  ive had alot of people witness these events to help prove to myself that what im seeing is real. they all agree that one what we are seeing(the bright object) was indeed moving around and two that stars do not move or disappear when photographed.  i know they can blink or twinkle but not move right? please help us down here we need the answers even if its unmaned aerial vehicle or gyrochopper or local, state, and maybe at times the federal. needless to say im going to continue my investagation on these events. thanlk you;34.273;-92.0859
