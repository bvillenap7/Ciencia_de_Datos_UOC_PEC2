Lake Village, Arkansas: observed 8 - 9 glowing white orbs passing over MS River;2012-05-26 21:05:00;10 min;Lake Village, Arkansas: observed 8 - 9 glowing white orbs passing over MS River May 26, 2012 9:05 pm (CDT) Lake Village, Arkansas  Several witnesses observed 8 - 9 glowing white orbs in the western sky. Lights passed over Mississippi River from Greenville, MS side to Lake Village, AR side of MS River.    Slow moving, low altitude, no sound, non-specific formation (however, four or so were in an equidistant straight line.)   Definitely not helicopters or airplanes.  Once each lighted orb reached a specific point in the sky, the light took off at &quotwarp speed&quot straight up at a sharp right angle.    The object was so far away in a fraction of a second - it disappeared, or was no longer visible. This scenario repeated for each light once it reached that same spot in sky. This is my and my Husband's third time to see lighted objects in the sky that behaved in exactly the same manner.  Other two times occurred over Lake Pontchartrain near Slidell, Louisiana, and around Dauphin Island, Alabama.
