silent Ball of light very high in the sky;2001-06-10 22:30:00;2 minutes;silent Ball of light very high in the sky This thing was very high in the sky,Round shape and Just glowed,What I would call a very light blue. I have seen these things,Probably 30 times in the last 24 years. The strange thing about these objects are,they Shine but never flash,there is no sound at all and they move quite fast. I am a Private Pilot myself and have known alot about Aviation all of my life And I also like the study of U.F.O's very much,I know enough that Airplanes do not act in that manner. For example A jet would have to be very high for you not to hear it's engine,and you will see flashing beacons,Would anyone have any info on these things,if anyone has sighted one would you please let me know ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.
