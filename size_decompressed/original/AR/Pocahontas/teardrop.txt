4 witnesses to an unexplained Ariel pursuit.;2012-05-02 21:30:00;30+ mins.;4 witnesses to an unexplained Ariel pursuit. U.F.O. spotted at approximately 21:30.  Event lasted from 21:30 - 22:30.  4 witnesses.   This spotting occurred in the vicinity of Randolph county, Arkansas, over the airport. The U.F.O.'s luminescence was between the brightness of a regular star and that of the space station seen in the late evening sky.   I spotted the object north of me with an airplane about the size of a small jetliner following its path east bound.  The plane followed the object back and forth repeatedly over the Pocahontas, Arkansas Municipal Airport.   From a side view the object appeared as a gliding light.  When the object exposed its front it appeared extremely bright with multiple lights, none of which were blinking, the outer lights being slightly dimmer.  During the objects last venture eastbound it appeared to have landed.  The plane continued to circle its last known position as the object ventured south which was the last sighting.  The plane following its path landed.  Another plane seemed to have picked up where left off but landed shortly after one circle. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witnes, and she seemed to us to be quite objective in her description of the object.  We suspect that she is a very good witness.
