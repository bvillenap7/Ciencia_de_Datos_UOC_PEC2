With binoculars, we could see it was saucer shaped. I was awakened by a phone call from my neighbors to see this thing in the sky. I got my binoculars to see this thing that was got me up at this time of night.  It was my first UFO experience. The object moved from light to left and would flicker green, blue and orange to the nakad eye. With my binoculars we could see that the top was blue, the center was orange and the bottom was green. As we observed it slowly moved westward. It was visible for about an hour before it left our sight heading west at around 230 am in the morning.
