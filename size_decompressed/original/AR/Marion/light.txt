As it got overhead, it slowed and came to stop, then proceded to make maneuvers in loops, forwards and backwards, stopped again and then raced off east.  About 5 minutes later 3 F-16s arrived and circled in attack formation for approximately 15 minutes.  Another 2 similar lights moved through the sky in similar patterns and directions over the next 2 hours after the first event.;35.2086;-90.1970000000001
