Spherical light in sky, moving at inhuman speed, brightens then disapears;2015-07-11 21:50:00;15 seconds;spherical light in sky, moving at inhuman speed, brightens then disapears I was sitting on my porch looking up at the stars, when I saw what I first thought was an airplane high in altitude.  I then realized it was closing the gap between 2 stars extremely fast, like no aircraft I've even seen.  All of the sudden it brightened and disappeared.  It was like someone was turning up a light bulb and then just turned it off.;35.2086;-90.1970000000001
