Fast moving light;2006-08-07 05:10:00;2 - 4 minutes;Fast moving light As we were leaving home to go to work at 5:10am, we pulled up to Hwy 1 faceing due East over Crowleys Ridge, south of Wynne AR. We noticed what appeared to be a round bright light. It was moving from North to South at a very high rate of speed and at a low altitude, left no con-trail and no other shape was visible except for the light.  The object's distance from me and altitude made it visible below the top of telephone poles on the other side of the 4 lane road.  It covered the distance between several poles in a matter of seconds. The object then appeared to turn left and upward then disappear.  As we pull out onto Hwy 1 heading south we noticed an object that seemed to be hovering with a strobe light. It would strobe about 10 times real fast then quit for a sec then start over.  we watched it for about 2 - 3 minutes as we were heading south until it started moving in the same direction as the first then it disappeared;35.2352;-90.7971
