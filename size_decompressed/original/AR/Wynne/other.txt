Odd flashing lights;2012-02-14 21:00:00;aprox. 4 min;Odd flashing lights 3 objects that appeared to be maybe the shape of a regular aircraft were flying very very close together.  That is how I am sure it couldn't have been normal aircraft.  They had red flashing lights and moved very slowly at first.  They seperated and moved farther apart. Then they started moving at a rapid rate.  It was very odd.  They also seemed to orginate or start around a yellow light. It was not the same color as a star, much brighter and very big, like the North star.  That object remained in place and did not move that I saw.
