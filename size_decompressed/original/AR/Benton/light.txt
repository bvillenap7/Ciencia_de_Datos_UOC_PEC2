Bright lit aircraft descends, and vanishes without a trace.;2009-01-03 19:00:00;2 seconds;Bright lit aircraft descends, and vanishes without a trace. I was facing north on my driveway talking on the telephone.  It was a clear night, and unseasonably warm for December.  In the sky north of Benton I saw a orb of light descend quickly towards the ground.  It moved at a speed which is unlike I have ever seen any typical aircraft.  The light was a solid bright yellow, and had to be within a mile from where I was standing.  The craft moved rapidly down, and abruptly stopped still above a tree line.  It wasn't too far from the ground when it stopped, probabley 50' above the trees.  The aircraft then flashed slightly brighter, and disappeared.  No noise.  No trail.  It vanished.
