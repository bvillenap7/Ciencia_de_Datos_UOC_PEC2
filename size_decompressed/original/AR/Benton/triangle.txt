At first glance it looked like a kite, triangular in shape and white in color.  It flew northbound and when it was directly above me, I knew it wasn't a kite, drone, or bird. There were no lights on the object and no sound.  It disappeared shortly after into the clouds (partly cloudy that night) and I heard the birds in that direction start to chirp wildly. My camera was mid exposure on a 30 second shot and the object flew just outside the left side of the frame.  Unfortunately, even with an ultra wide 14mm lens on at the time, I was unable to capture anything.  The whole event lasted no longer than 10 seconds.
