I have only told friends about this event. I have never reported it officially. As I see more and more reports on the television, I felt obliged to report this event.At my rural home, in the evening, I was sitting on my front steps. It was a summer evening and the sky was clear excpet for a few pink clouds on the horizon. Silently and from out of nowhere an object resembling the bottom of a plate or saucer appeared out of my periferal vision. It hovered if front of me across the road, still no sound for about a minute. As I watched, it suddenly whisked or zoomed at an amazing speed, much to agile for any aircraft. I've never seen anything like this before. The most amazing thing to me was inspite of the large size, uncanny speed and the fact that it hovered, was the stark silence. I knew that instant I saw it, that is was a UFO. I never felt compelled to convince anyone, just relate it to a few friends. I understand now why some people who see UFo say they didn't really care whether anyone believed them or not that they knew instincively what it was. This was my experience. I have never seen anything like this before or since. I am a registered nurse, mom, wife. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.5400083333334;-92.6045583333334
