Cylinder shaped UFO with lights hovering above tree line in Benton, Arkansas.;2010-06-22 00:36:00;1 minute;Cylinder shaped UFO with lights hovering above tree line in Benton, Arkansas. On June 22nd of 2010, at 12:36 a.m., my brother and I witnessed a UFO flying in Benton,  Arkansas.   I went outside to smoke and my brother came with me to keep me company.  As soon as we stepped outside, before I could light my cigarette, a UFO flew past us. It made this eerie factory like sound that I’ve never heard any plane or other aircraft make before.  That’s what initially drew my attention.    We looked up to see this cylinder shaped UFO flying right above our tree line, closer to the ground than anything has ever flown above our house.  We live right in the middle of town, so aircraft stays pretty high up.   It had three green flashing lights and 2 red flashing lights on the underside.  It had no wings, and flew at a speed faster than anything I’ve ever seen fly before.   As soon as my brother and I witnessed it, the UFO was out of our sight.;34.5400083333334;-92.6045583333334
