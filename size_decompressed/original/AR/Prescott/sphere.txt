We looked to the right and what at first we remembered we were all discusing the knew light up water tower that this town must have erected.  When we arived in Litte Rock and were talking we realized we were at least 2 Hrs off on our normal arival time.  We pretty soon began remembering bits and pieces of the space ship.  At first all three of us could talk about the ship ,  then one of us never wanted to discuss It,  but she didn't deny that it happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.8034;-93.3681
