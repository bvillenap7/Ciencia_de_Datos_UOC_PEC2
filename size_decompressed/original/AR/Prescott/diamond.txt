Got 3 pictures manage to get stocked when I seen what this was going on on the side of the interstate not sure what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be eloquent, sincere, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very reliable witness.  Witness has provided photos, which indicate a lighted object, seen against a dark sky, but the image is blurry, and, therefore, ambiguous.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) The object I observed not quite sure what it was it had red and white lights it was really bright white light with like a tail behind it like a comet and it stopped and just stood in place for a few seconds like a helicopter and all of a sudden it's shot back from the right to the left again for approximately I don't know I guess a few miles stop steel again and then shot straight up and disappeared at first I thought it was a falling star when I first seen it but a falling star does not stop in mid-air and start over I sent you three pictures I hope you got them was not the clearest pictures but one of them you can see the tail behind it again this was 15-20 miles west of Prescott Arkansas on Interstate 40 halfway between Little Rock and Memphis Tennessee I told the other guy that was running with me that start with me to send a report he said he would before the night was out I hope you can make heads or tails out of the pictures I tried to zoom in with his cell phone as good as I could but as I said I'm not the best with technology God bless you and have a great weekend oh I meant to say when it stopped it kind of had a reddish tint to it like a reddish light then turn to bright white light like somebody turned a spotlight on you but it was a long ways away of course it was just not right on top of me but it was a distance and you can tell it was close enough I got that photo;33.8034;-93.3681
