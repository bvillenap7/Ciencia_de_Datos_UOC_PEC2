Nieghbor came and told me to come out and look at the sky.  Above us were numerous white lights and not stars.  Stars don't move as fast as these were moving.  I believe they were going, I think, east to west.  We were not the only ones to see this group of lights.  People on the other side of our county did too and notified my neighbor and that is how we seen it.  Some lights were bright white and some more a duller white like up higher in the sky.  At first I thought they were stars but stars don't move from east to west at any rate of speed that can be seen in a short span of time and actually followed.;35.824;-92.0391
Moved too fast & silently to be an airplaine.;2007-03-28 04:30:00;10-30 seconds;Moved too fast & silently to be an airplaine. I live in a rural area of the Ozarks.  I was sitting on my front porch drinking morning coffee. I was facing west. I noticed a very bright blinking light to the north barely above the tree lines. Just a second later it blinked again, but was farther south. This went on for about 30 seconds, always going south, just veering east or west a small percentage, until it went out of sight behind the trees, about five miles south of me. This light made no sound.  The background was dark gray, since we had rain earlier. There was no wind, no stars, the clouds were still out. This object was below the clouds. This was the first time I had observed this.;35.824;-92.0391

Also small lights traveling at different times and in different directions, these made maneuvers that turned quickly at high speeds but these were constant and went until out of sight.  Very far away.;35.824;-92.0391
