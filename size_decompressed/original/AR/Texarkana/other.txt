15-20 cigar-shaped ships with red and blue lights, numerous bright white lights apearing and dissapearing,;2007-08-06 22:20:00;30 min;15-20 cigar-shaped ships with red and blue lights, numerous bright white lights apearing and dissapearing, I was outside smoking a cigarette at 10:20 p.m. on August 06, 2007 and was looking in the sky in the direction of our local airport.  A very bright light illuminated and went off.  Then what looked like an inch in the sky to the right another very bright light went off. This repeated a 3rd and 4th time.  Then I saw the first of what would be atleast 15-20 of these strange red and blue lighted cigar shaped crafts.  It just went directly left like 4 inches in sky then dissapeared.  Then another bright light appeared and went off.....moved inch right and on and off again...then moved up and on and off....then left (completing a square).  Then I saw what had to be 3 of the cigar shaped red and blue lighted crafts going in differnt directions and they were traveling extremly slow.  Seemed to just blow in the wind and none made any noise.  I went inside to get my mother to show her the display and she saw the cigar first then few minutes later the bright lights started again. She got scared and went inside and I soon followed.  We opened the mini-blinds in the living room window to keep watching. Ten minutes went on with the bright lights and cigar shaped ships.  The cigar shaped ones had the ability to be visible then non-visible, just like the bright lights.  Then the strangest of all the occurances happened and I have no good way of describing it.  An extremly bright neon red light shot up in the middle of the sky and it changed colors as it got higher in the sky to neon orange then neon yellow.  The light looked to be 1 inch long at the base. Then the left side curved to the right.  The right side curved to the right.  The light met at one point where the curved sides met. This illuminated the sky.  It was a light like I have never seen.  Then it dissapeared.  I continued to see the cigar shaped ones and the bright lights untill 10:55.  I do not know if it stopped when I stopped looking.....I was too scared to watch anymore.;33.4314324324324;-93.884727027027
