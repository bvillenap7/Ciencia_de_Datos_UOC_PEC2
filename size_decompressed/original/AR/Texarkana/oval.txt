I steped out of my doctors office and happened to glance up at the northern sky when I saw a oval or, blimp looking craft.  It favored a blimp but I have never saw a blimp with a flat bottom and it was very high in the sky and flying very fast.  Too fast to be a blimp.  It was in the eastern part of the notthern sky when I first saw it and only took about 45 seconds to a minute for it to get in the western sky then turn north and in a few seconds it was out of sight.  I ran inside the doctors office and ask a lady to come out to see this thing before it dissapeared so I would not be the only one to see it.  She said it couldn't be a jet because it had no vapor trail but was flying even faster than any jet I have ever seen.  It was silver, almost white on color.  One could tell it was a matalic objeck.  Also there was no sound comming from this object. This is what I saw. I believe it to be a UFO because I am 59 years old, employed, and retired, from a army depot.;33.4314324324324;-93.884727027027
