Stationary hovering object that changed in color, shape and magnitude.;2005-04-28 02:00:00;1 hour;Stationary hovering object that changed in color, shape and magnitude. At first, I thought it was just a shooting star or something but looked over and saw something I thought might have been a star.  The longer I sat outside and watched this star, it started changing.  The color which was a very pure almost purplish/white began increasing and decreasing in intensity. Then I noticed it started changing in size and shape.  Eventually after I thought I must have been going crazy and had my mother come outside to take a look, the object started changing colors as well, from purple to green to blue to red to orange and white.   It sat in the same spot the whole time I was watching it however, for about an hour. Then, it just dissappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  Possible twinkling star, we suspect.  Just a guess.  PD));35.9274;-89.9189
