A bright pinpoint of light appeared in the West-Southwest sky. I was driving back to Gulfport, MS in my car, after a weekend visit to my hometown of St. Louis. The sun had just set, but the sky was clear and still too bright to see any stars yet. As I drove on southbound I-55 through the short stretch of Arkansas before Memphis, a bright pinpoint of light caught my attention in my peripheral vision. It was in the West Southwest sky, at roughly 2 o'clock on a clockface, as I faced South. It was bright white, looked at first like a plane with the sun glinting off it. I then assumed it was a very bright star. I continued to watch the object, and noticed it did not move. There was no contrail. Suddenly, the object began to fade and lose brightness, and appeared to almost implode upon itself, until it disappeared completely. It was like watching a star burn out.  Fascinated, I continued to watch that space in the sky. Sure enough, about 2 minutes later, the bright object faded back ON, until it was at its former brightness.  It didn't stay bright as long as the previous time, but again, faded out slowly til it was not visible any more.  I tried to notice if any other southbound drivers or truckers had seen the strange light.  I only wish I had had a cb at that moment I could have asked the truckers to look up, or ask them if they had also seen it.;35.9274;-89.9189
