Oval formation of 16 glowing objects with beam coming downward from center.;1973-10-03 23:00:00;30 minutes;Oval formation of 16 glowing objects with beam coming downward from center. On a fishing trip on Black River in NE Arkansas, my mother 73, was awakened by a bright light outside her window.  She went on the deck and saw an oval formation of 16 round objects with a beam of light coming from the middle of formation, downward, in slightly left direction.  (6:35 direction on clock)  She compared the objects the size of her thumb nail.  Being a devout woman, she thought she was seeing a heavenly vision.  She awakened her two lady friends so they could see it also. She drew a picture of the sighting and ask me to make a painting of it. I did an air brush painting but she pasted stars on the oval objects.  This vision stayed on her mind until she died at the age of 85.   I have no proof except her word, notes and my drawing but I was wondering if anyone else ever saw a formation like this?;36.3227;-91.411
