Missing time and bright lights;2017-12-17 21:00:00;20 minutes;Missing time and bright lights My oldest son and I, where coming home from a friend's house on 12/17/2017.  It was dark already.  We where driving down Sullenburger, when we noticed a bright light.  We stopped the car because we could not see to drive, it was like someone was shining a spotlight in our eyes.  We sat there for what seemed like only a minute and started driving again.   I had a funny feeling like I was just waking up.  (After talking to my son he experienced this just waking up feeling also.)  Kinda disoriented that's when I noticed the First Baptist church.  We where no longer on Sullenburger we where on Clardy St.   Both of us looked at each other and  started comparing stories.  We lost a full 20 minutes.   Both he and I both had a strange buzzing sensation at the base of our skulls and neck pain for about 15 minutes after this encounter.;34.3657;-92.8118
