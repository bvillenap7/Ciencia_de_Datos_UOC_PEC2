Large solid white ball.;2017-11-08 22:20:00;2 minutes;Large solid white ball. I went out to smoke on break and saw a large bright light toward Tontitown.   My initial thought was an airplane, but as I stared, I realized, not only was this thing way too big to be an airplane (unless it was flying much, much lower than needed) but it was solid white. For almost a full minute, it stayed in one place, then darted toward Arvest Ballpark.  It looked to have been directly over the Pilot truck stop before taking off.  Seconds after crossing Hwy 412 E., it disappeared.;36.1496;-94.2399
