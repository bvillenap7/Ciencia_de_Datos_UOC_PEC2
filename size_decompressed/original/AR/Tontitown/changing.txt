A glowing white orb that changed to a barbell and back to an orb;2017-10-20 22:30:00;2 minutes;A glowing white orb that changed to a barbell and back to an orb I was driving home, saw a light in the sky, at first I thought it was an airliner, but it was to bright for that, as I started watching it, it changed from an orb shape to a barbell shape and back to an orb, it did this for a few minutes and stayed a barbell shape and just vanished,  I called a buddy of mine and he looked west, as we were talking he heard a loud jet heading from east to west.;36.1496;-94.2399
