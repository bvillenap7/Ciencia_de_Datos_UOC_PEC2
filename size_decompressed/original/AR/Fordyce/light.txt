Lights traveling.  ((Starlink satellites??);2020-04-28 21:30:00;5-10min;Lights traveling I was driving and saw 10 lights moving in a straight line, very fast, towards the moon. Once they were in the moon lights path they disappeared and the appeared to have scattered in 5 different directions, 2 aircrafts in each direction. I wouldâ€™ve thought they were planes, but they had no other lights on them.;33.817;-92.4266
