This went on for about an hour or more.some were in V shaped patterns and some that were in a pattern that resembled kites with a tail. We literally saw hundreds of these lights were in the sky at the same time. Most were white in color but there were maybe 20 that were brighter and appeared to be a little larger with an amber color. I made phone calls to several people in west little Rock and they were visible from there as well.;34.5235;-92.2758
