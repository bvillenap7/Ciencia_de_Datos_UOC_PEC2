Large red/orange sphere sighted flying east for about five seconds.;2009-08-22 20:00:00;5 seconds;Large red/orange sphere sighted flying east for about five seconds. At approximately ten pm on August 22, 2009 I was outside on a blanket facing south. I was just stargazing, as there were a few nice meteors. I noticed as I looked southeast a large, red/orange ball flying east at approximately 1500 feet, going fast. The object was in my sight for approximately five seconds, before leaving my view by going behind some trees. As I had been looking in that direction a few seconds before, and saw nothing, then looked west-northwest for a second, then looked back to the south when I observed the object, I have no idea where it came from. I got up and went into my home to get a camera in the hope of seeing it again, but it did not come back this way. I live on a hill overlooking a pasture going down a valley to the south for two miles. I have a great view of this valley, with the east and west being blocked by woods. This area is not a flight corridor, with the exception of three to four C-130â€™s that fly over during the week. This was not a plane. I was in the US Air Force, and love to fly, but this big sphere was in no way a light, in my opinion.;35.3016786516854;-93.0850157303372
