Black and Grey boomerang shaped UFO with no lights and no sound;2012-12-15 21:00:00;3 minutes;A very large black and grey boomerang shaped UFO with no lights and no sound.  It took almost the same path as the B52's that fly over for military training.   It flew very slow and straight about the same height as a small local aircraft.  It was black with grey trim around the front of it.  I was in my back yard with another individual.  We both saw it and tried to watch it for as long as we could until we could no longer see it.   The other individual was recently retired military.  He didn't know what it was either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
