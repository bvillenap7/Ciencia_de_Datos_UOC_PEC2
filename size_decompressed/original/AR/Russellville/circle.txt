Orange/yellow lights appeared and vanished almost as quickly as they were seen, about the size of jet lights. No noise.;2020-06-16 09:30:00;5 minutes;Orange/yellow lights appeared and vanished almost as quickly as they were seen, about the size of jet lights. No noise. This event occurred twice. Standing outside talking on the phone when I noticed two orange/yellow lights, both about the size of jet lights.  The lights then seemed to multiply. At that moment there were four lights, all the same size in a vertical line.  About six feet apart.  As soon as it multiplied about ten seconds went by and it vanished.  There was no sound present.  The following night, again was outside, I saw two more lights in a different area.   same lights I had seen prior, only this time they did not multiply.  I then saw the lights again three more times, all around the same area.  I did notice that after seeing the first set, there were a few smaller white lights.  They could have been helicopters, but there were approximately six or seven of them.  They flew back and forth quite a few times and disappeared.  Not soon after, maybe two or three minutes, I again saw the same lights. However, this time there was about seven or eight, seemingly to belong to the same ship.  There was never any noise or indication it was there other than the lights.  I never saw an aircraft, only the lights.;35.3016786516854;-93.0850157303372
