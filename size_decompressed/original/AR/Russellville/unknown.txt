I woke my husband and asked him , ''WHAT IS THAT NOISE?.  He listened and said I don't know  and run to the window toward the side of the noise. Not seeing anything he ran to the den and approached the window facing the side of the house the noise was emmitting from. It became louder and faster in a burst of noise suddenly faded off. The dogs and cat had been barking continally while the niose was present and immediately quietened after the noise stopped. It was unlike anything we have ever heard. My Husband said what ever was outside saw him come toward the window as it speed up the beat and vanished. Our dogs are out loose as we live in the country and only bark at strange animals or people.  We had our christmas lights on outside and inside the house. Could it have been attracted to the lights of the christmas tree?  The window my husband approached had wood blinds partially opened so outsiders could see the lights easily.  We have a large pasture next to the house-1/2 mile or so. It was a noise with a fast variable beep similar to the sound a touch tone phone makes on redial but more defined and scaled variable beeps. Their are no electical or phone lines outside that side of the house. I would be interested if anyone has had similar  events or if an explaination could be given.;35.3016786516854;-93.0850157303372
Line of red lights drifting  over south side of Crow Mountain;2006-08-15 00:30:00;10 seconds;Line of red lights drifting  over south side of Crow Mountain Smoking a ciggarette outside my friends house on the Atkins side of Crow Mountain. between 12:25am-12:45am I looked to the south, a perfectly straight line of 6 to 8 solid red lights were drifting West to east appox. 30-40mph. What appears to be the front(I think)of the line of lights would tilt their angle about 10 degrees down and then back to center. This happens 2 times. Then it angles about 30 degrees down, and slowly disappears behind the distant treeline. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
