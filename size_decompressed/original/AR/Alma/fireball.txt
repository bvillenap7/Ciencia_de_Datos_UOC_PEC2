I went outside to take a walk and as I was walking down the driveway I just happened to look up at an airplane that was flying overhead.  As I was observing all of a sudden I saw a red-orange fireball that appeared to be trailing the airplane but from a distance.  I yelled out to my 25 year old son and said look, What is That ? The object then had made an erratic move to the right and all of a sudden was in the distance in front and below the airplane and then we saw a second fireball coming from the same direction as the first one, which was moving from the east moving northeast also seeming to trail the aircraft.   It made a sudden vertical move as it got closer to the aircraft and then it just vanished.   I have been a Flight attendant for 17 years and have never seen anything like this before .;35.4973;-94.2081

We were traveling south on 540 and saw 6 bright orange fire balls that appeared to be floating in a southern bound direction.  We saw them for about 10-15 minutes before they disappeared.  They were visible from the highway from Westfork to south of Alma.  Not sure if they burned out or we just lost sight of them in the horizon.  A trail of smoke was visible behind each light and they were not lined up perfectly or in any kind of pattern.  They were grouped together and traveling at mostly similar speeds.;35.4973;-94.2081
