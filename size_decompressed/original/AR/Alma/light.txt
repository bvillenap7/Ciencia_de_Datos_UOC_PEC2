A light going fast in a straight line & jagged to the left once & then dissappeared;2005-07-14 23:00:00;20-25 seconds;A light going fast in a straight line & jagged to the left once & then dissappeared It was late evening around 11pm central time. We just got back home and we looked up at the stars it was clear and beautiful. This is when we saw a star moving pretty fast across the sky. It was a bright white light, it was going in a straight line and then it jagged over to the left and went straight again then you can tell it was headed out into outerspace because the light faded and then dissappeared all the while it stayed straight. You have to look straight up to see it. There were no sounds from an aircraft. It was not a shooting star. It looked just like a normal star but it was moving. There was only one.

Bright purple objects were seen falling from the sky before a large white sphere moved across the sky towards Mountainburg.;2016-05-22 21:50:00;5 seconds;Bright purple objects were seen falling from the sky before a large white sphere moved across the sky towards Mountainburg. After seeing two large purple meteor-like objects falling bright enough to be seen behind thick trees, a bright white light was spotted in the sky.  Not only were there no lights flashing like a plane, but it moved from one side of the sky to the other (from the ESE) in approximately five seconds.  For reference, the fastest nearby plane was timed moving across the same amount of distance in approximately  20 seconds.;35.4973;-94.2081
