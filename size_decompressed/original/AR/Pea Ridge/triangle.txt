BLACK/OPAQUE TRIANGULAR SHAPE...NO LIGHTS AT ALL, NO SOUND;2015-08-27 09:45:00;3 seconds;BLACK/OPAQUE TRIANGULAR SHAPE...NO LIGHTS AT ALL, NO SOUND I OBSERVED A TRIANGULAR CRAFT THAT APPEARED TO BE BLACK OR OPAQUE...NO LIGHTS OF ANY SORT, NO SOUND AT ALL. IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE A SHADOW PASSING UNDER THE CLOUDS APPROX. 15-20,000 FEET.  IT MOVED MUCH TOO FAST TO BE OF ANY MAN MADE CRAFT (AT LEAST THAT THE GOVT' HAS DECLASSIFIED).   NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE OR SINCE AND I AM VERY SKEPTICAL OF UFOS.  IT WAS VERY EERIE. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
