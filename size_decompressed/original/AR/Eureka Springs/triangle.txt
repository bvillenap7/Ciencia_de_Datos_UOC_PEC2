The two neighbors were underneath the porch and I was standing outside of the porch observing a particularly clear sky, the Pleiades, and the Milky Way.  I was facing south when a small triangular shape appeared overhead traveling northward from behind me heading southward in the direction I was looking and into my line of view.  I yelled to the others to come and see this object.   One neighbor came out from under the porch just in time to see it go over the house and disappear out of the line of sight.  It was moving steady and seemed no higher than 60-100 feet at most.  It was completely silent and the flattened tips of the triangle had a faint glow. It was also traveling not point forward rather with points to the side and back direction. We discussed that we did not know what we had just see as my neighbor went back under the porch. I kept looking in direction shocked at the sig! hting. Just then a large glowing object like a shooting star came directly from where the object disappeared to and shot off heading east. I was the only one that saw the shooting star.;36.4244272727273;-93.7437545454546
