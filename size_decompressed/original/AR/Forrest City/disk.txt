It was so big it blocked the sunlight for a whole block, we all started screaming. the adults were inside playing cards, my brother-inlaw heard us screeming and ran to the door to see what was going on. when he looked up to where we were pointing, his eyes got real big, then he ran down the hall to get the shotgun i could tell he was terrified. When he put his hands on the gun, the craft lifted and slowly moved off. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.0081;-90.7768
