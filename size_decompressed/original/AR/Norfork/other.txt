White Capsule (pill) shaped object, low altitude, slow speed, no sound;2001-04-29 17:30:00;2 min;White Capsule (pill) shaped object, low altitude, slow speed, no sound It was 5:30pm CST Sunday. My girlfriend saw something in the sky and I turned to look.  It was capsule shaped (like a pill).  I thought it may have been a hot air baloon, but there was no cabin,no engine, ailerons, external devices etc.   About the size of a bus, white, traveling approx 120-150 mph heading directly north.  Altitude approx 1,000' AGL.  No engine sound or other, no vapor trails. It was moving in conjunction and just in front (by a couple hours) of a cold front which lasted about a week. I noticed that local residents, including my baby developed cold symptoms for about a week.;36.204;-92.2764
