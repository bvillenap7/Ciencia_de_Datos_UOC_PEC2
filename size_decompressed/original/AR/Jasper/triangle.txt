Triangle formation of lights in the sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Report not inconsistent with U. S. Navy NOSS satellites.  PD));2004-06-05 22:30:00;30 seconds;Triangle formation of lights in the sky at approximately 22:30 we were on the back porch of our home.  We had been watching satellites traveling overhead for about an hour when we suddenly saw a triangular formation traveling from the Northwest to the Southeast.  They looked like satellite's at first, but they traveled across the sky in a perfect triangle formation.  Seems like if they were satellites, they would eventually catch up to each other or their rates of travel would change some.  But these didn't, just kept a perfect formation until the got out of view.  We seem to have had a big night for all sorts of objects in the sky that night.  I am a part-time dispatcher and own and operate my own computer repair/networking business.  I also have 11 years of military service.  The objects were white, color never changed, only dimmed and got brighter in the sky.  We also noticed that the night sky would flash every couple of minutes, and our car's dome light strangely came on. ((NUFORC Note:  Report not inconsistent with a sighting of U. S.
