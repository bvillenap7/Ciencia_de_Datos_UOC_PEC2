On Monday evening, February 4, 2008 (about 9:00 PM) my 3 children, ages 14, 12, and 9 witnessed a round aircraft go directly over our house. It has many lights on it, And they could clearly see that it was large and circular. It had a strange smelling exhaust-which my husband and I could smell after the craft wasnâ€™t in sight. None of the witnesses had ever seen anything like this before. Afterward, I told someone where I work, and she saw it as well-on the same night and described it as round as well.;36.0063;-93.208
