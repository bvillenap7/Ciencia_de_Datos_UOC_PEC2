Outside in drive way, wife noticed a weird beam of light.  It was traveling low but at very high speed, no vapor trails or flashing lights.  Seemed to be shooting out some sort of beam the best i could describe it is like what a scanner beam looks like in scifi movies.  It sent out maybe 3 beams and vanished in the distance.;36.0557;-90.52
