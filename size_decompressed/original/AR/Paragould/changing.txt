Dancing lights merge and seperate while traveling west to east in a matter of seconds.;2004-07-06 22:40:00;6 seconds;Dancing lights merge and seperate while traveling west to east in a matter of seconds. I live in Paragould Arkansas.   At roughly 10:40 pm I walked out of my house and looked up at the sky, surprised to see stars after the recent heavy rains.  I saw to the west a large dark mass with about 6-8 lights.  It was traveling rapidly across the horizon heading east.  The mass split into 2 sections of about 3-4 lights each.  The 2 masses then danced together, merging and seperating as they crossed the sky rapidly.  The entire sighting lasted only about 5 or 6 seconds.  My husband thought it was a satelite, since he says he only saw 1 light and it's speed was so fast, but it appeared very low to me. The lights were white, with a darker mass apparent between them.  The sky was mostly clear with few visible clouds.;36.0557;-90.52
