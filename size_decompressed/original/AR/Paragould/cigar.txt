Cigar shaped object with blinking lights drops glowing spheres;2010-11-04 21:30:00;10 minutes;Cigar shaped object with blinking lights drops glowing spheres A few years ago I was hanging out with my friend at his house on the far west side of Paragould near the Gravel Pits. We were causing a lot of noise so his Mom made us go outside.  We decided to go walk along the gravel roads in the woods.  While walking we came upon an opening and decided to rest for a minute or two.  I happened to look up at the sky when I saw something I could not explain. It had a shape of a cigar and was slowly hovering over the tree line quite a good ways away.  It had about 6 slowly blinking red lights.  As it made its way across it started dropping glowing spheres in to the woods.  We just stood there compelled at what the heck this thing was.  After about 10 minutes it just disappeared out of sight.  Amazed we ran back to his house to tell his Mom.  After we told her she did not believe us and said it was just an airplane. Ever since then we have not talked about it with each other or anyone else. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.0557;-90.52
Large cigar or triangle shaped fast moving object with 2 lights.;2016-09-09 20:20:00;5 minutes;Large cigar or triangle shaped fast moving object with 2 lights. Traveling into Paragould from Jonesboro.  Saw a large either cigar or triangle shaped black object (hard to tell as it was dark outside as well) moving fast, with two bright lights on either end.  It flew directly overhead of my vehicle.  I've never seen anything like it, but I have seen other UFO's in the area.;36.0557;-90.52
