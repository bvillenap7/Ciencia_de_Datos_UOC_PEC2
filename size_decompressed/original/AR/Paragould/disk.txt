When it took off again, it made a loud howling noise. I,d guess the diameter was around 100feet, and the height to be around 15 feet.  We were about fifty feet away from the craft when it landed.  the color of the light were blue.  Our metal detector circuits were fried becaus of the interference from the craft.   When the craft took off it hovered for a few secons, then it vanished.;36.0557;-90.52
