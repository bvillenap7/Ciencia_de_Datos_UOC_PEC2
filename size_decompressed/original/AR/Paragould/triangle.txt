ufo sighting in northeast Arkansas with video;2020-06-02 22:30:00;2 hours;ufo sighting in northeast Arkansas with video Tuesday night, 6-2-2020 at 11 pm my wife and I were sitting out on our back deck at home in Northeast Arkansas, I was reclining in my chair l ooking at the almost full moon and stars and I noticed what at first I thought was a twinkling star. Then it would shift mostly horizontally.  The more I watched it and as my eyes adjusted to darkness, I could see this object wasn’t “giving off” its light it was reflection of the moon light off of it.  With the naked eye, it would pulse three tiny lights(I assume tiny) and separate into two lights and back. I was sitting in lawn chair facing west/slightly northwest. The first star in the big dipper handle was to left, about 3-4 inches ( if I held my index finger and thumb to gauge )from craft.  I filmed it with my phone. I have several videos of it.;36.0557;-90.52
