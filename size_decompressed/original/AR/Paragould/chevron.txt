Chevron-shaped UFO hovering silently over Greene County Arkansas;2018-09-20 20:40:00;1 minute;chevron shaped UFO hovering silently over Greene County Arkansas We were in car driving north on highway 351 in Greene County, Arkansas, close to the Crowleyâ€™s Ridge Raceway.  As we approached, we noticed a horizontal line of several lights up ahead above the tree line.  When we got closer it appeared to be higher than a cell tower, but not real big, about the size of a small single propeller airplane.   The closer we got to it, we saw a green light on one end and a red light on the other with a white light in center.  None of the lights were blinking.  We drove directly under it, low enough to see bottom of craft.  It was not moving and not making any sound, looked like a boomerang with 3 lights on bottom in a chevron shape.  No windows observed, grey/black in color.  Very creepy.;36.0557;-90.52
