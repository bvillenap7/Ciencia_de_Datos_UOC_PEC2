Unexplainable!;2013-06-05 22:00:00;3 minutes;unexplainable! my wife and I were on our way home and just before we turned into the driveway I spotted five white and lights but they actually illuminated what appeared to be a red craft of some sort.  They were not much higher than treetop level. I hurried up and pulled into my driveway and grabbed my I phone so I could film it/them .   I started filming and three of them turned the lights off and changed formation.  At first I thought it was a low flying aircraft but was shocked to get out of my truck and not hear any prop noise/ rotor blade noise or jet engines AT ALL!   the front two lights in the formation remained on.  all five of them flew off toward the south-east out of sight.   we are not alcoholics nor do we use any type of drugs.  we were absolutely clear minded when we saw this.  im so glad I was able to capture this on my I phone.;34.6066;-92.4904
