2 light crafts captured on video;2017-03-18 09:50:00;20 seconds;2 light crafts captured on video Wife yells UFO, so I jump up and run outside to see my wife and son, age 11, watching 2 disc shaped Ships of Light straight up Rollin.  They were two separate craft, one following the other.   They weren't physically connected but were connected, or synced rather.  Each craft was the most brilliant orange, probably about 30 ft across cruising maybe 25, 30 mph.  We all watched until they eventually faded away northbound.  My son captured 4 seconds of video of this event.;34.6066;-92.4904
