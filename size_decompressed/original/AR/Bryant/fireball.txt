The object was not the usual strong silvery-white of the ISS, but more pink-orange and hazy.  Of course, at this time of the year, heavy moisture will color the sunsets and the metropolitan area had an Ozone Alert.  This object didn't act like typical fireworks.  The object appeared toward the south around 30 degrees inclination and moving northerly with a alight easterly bent.  It flickered like an object reentering the atmosphere being burned, yet the rate it moved in the sky was very much like viewing the Space Station.
