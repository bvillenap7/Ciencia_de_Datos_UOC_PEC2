Two slowly hovering amber lights.;2011-07-04 22:00:00;3 minutes;Two slowly hovering amber lights. Two amber lights floating in the sky very slowly coming directly from the north then turned and went north west, then one disappeared and about 5 seconds later then other one did.   This was no fireworks or plane or helicopter.  At times it looked like they would come to almost a complete stand still. It was very weird.;34.6066;-92.4904
2 light orbs in SW sky, very high altitude moving syncronistically in speed and distance.;2012-07-26 19:35:00;15 minutes;2 light orbs in SW sky, very high altitude moving syncronistically in speed and distance. Walking out my front door, gf and I saw something in the SW sky that looked like 2 bright lights. Very high altitude, and moving syncronistically together, exact same speed, exact same distance apart, until one disappeared behind the clouds, then the other. 3-5 minutes later, one returned and we watched for 1-2 minutes.  Heading towards LR on AR Hwy.5, we kept our eyes to the sky.  Between Pinecrest Cemetary and Alexander Rd, there was a 100-500 foot gap in the treeline, we looked towards Interstate 30, and there was a single light orb at lower altitude (less than 5000 ft). I tried to slow down, but the treeline was back so i hurried to Alexander Rd and the I-30 overpass, but when we got there, there was no sign of anything, anywhere.;34.6066;-92.4904
Six orange colered moving lights above Bryant,  Arkansas on 5 July 2013 at approximently 21:00;2013-06-05 21:00:00;5 minutes;Six orange colered moving lights above Bryant, Arkansas on 5 July 2013 at approximently 21:00 I was driving home after getting gas in my car at a Shell station in Bryant, Arkansas.  I was driving westbound on an access road running beside Interstate 30.  It was a clear night and half-way between exit 123 and 121 is when I observered these lights.  There were 6.  They did not appear to be flying in an symetrical formation but did stay together all but one which headed off to the southeast and appeared to be descending.  The color of the lights/objects was a shade of Orange I just can't put into words.  The other lights/objects seemed to remain on their course which from my vantage point was south.  They actaully flew/hovered over me as I was driving and I pulled over to keep watching them.  The color and intensity of the lights never wavered.   I have watched a lot of UFO shows on TV and was always waiting for that ah ha moment when they figured out it was a plane, helicopter or other aircraft.  To be honest what I saw sent chills all through me and even as I wr! ite this, I hope it can be explained but as it stands now it cannot.  After the sighting I called 911, I don't really know if it was fear that motivated me or just plain curiosity.  The 911 operator took the information I gave down and proceded to call the FAA.  I asked if I could call back and see what they said and she gave me their direct number.   After about 30 minutes I called back and they were still on the phone with the FAA in Little Rock and the FAA told the dispatch officer there were no radar hits in the area.  Shortly after my first call an off duty police officer saw and reported the exact same thing to 911, at the present his location of his sighting is unknown to me.  These lights as I was reminded by an authority on lights are difficult to gauge distance and size so I will try to use the surrounding enviroment as a reference.  First glance I would have said the size of a hot air balloon at what I estimated at about 2000 feet above ground level but since the objects appeared to be just light those esitmates could be way off both in si ze and altitude.  Their movement was constant and slow except for the one I previously mentioned.  I have never witnessed any event like the one I just witnessed in my life.   Whatever it was is to me a true Unidentified Flying Object.;34.6066;-92.4904
7 orange lights appeared from above.;2013-07-15 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;7 orange lights appeared from above. This is my second UFO encounter.  I have tried every way I can think of to explain this but I cannot.  These were , in my opinion , the same kind of objects I first reported on the 5th of June of this year.   This sighting has one major exception though, I was in my car with the windows down and moonroof open listening to some music.  The lights in my car started to dim, so I started the car thinking I was draining the battery.  Lights back to full intensity, for about 20 seconds.   Then everything, engine, lights, radio, horn, security system, went haywire for about 10 seconds and then my car went silent.  No power from anything.   Almost immediately these lights appeared from above me and spread out in a line, north to south.  The 4th light was directly above me.  No sound could be heard and I was in an area where there is very little or no sound pollution.  I know this sounds like encounters of the third kind but this was more intense.  I felt the need to get out of my car and look up at the lights.  They seemed to be perfectly still above me.  This lasted for 3 to five minutes.  Then the lights apeared to either disappear completely or ascend straight up.  The color of the objects was a bright deep orange.  I returned to my car which was still unresponsive to my attempts to start or using my keyless remote to open doors or trunk.   About a minute after the objects left the lights blinked and the horn honked, like you had just locked the car. I pushed the start button and it started.   I drove home and as I was leaving two people outside the gate where I was at flagged me down and asked me if I saw what they saw.  I asked them hat it was they saw.  They told me that a bunch of lights came down and one of them hovered right over me.  They wanted to know if I touched it.  From their vantage point it looked like the light was very close to me.   The night was clear, no clouds, wind was variable.;34.6066;-92.4904
