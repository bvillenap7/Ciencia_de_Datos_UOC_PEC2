Not alot of motion.;2002-07-19 22:00:00;116 Hwy. 25;Not alot of motion. We were driving east of Highway 25 when our youngest child had mentioned a flash of green light in the sky. In our amazement, we pulled over and decided to obserb. The green light suddenly turned red and another flash of green light apppeared. About this time, the red flash of light, once green, disappeared. By now, the other green light had turned red as well, then hovered there for a few mintues, then sort of meandered through the sky, then also disapeared.;35.5114;-92.0430000000001
