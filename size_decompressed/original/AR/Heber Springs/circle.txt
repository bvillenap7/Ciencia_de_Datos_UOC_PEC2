It was fast.;2007-08-20 02:00:00;30 sec;It was fast. A Green circle light that moved fast and in a zigzag way. At first i thought it was a firefly but it moved so fast and was up so high in the sky. And it left a trail as it moved like a haze. Then it stopped. It lasted 30 sec but didn't even see it go. Just went out of sight.

My wife said, &quotLook!!&quot and then pointed at a round shiny object in the midst of the contrail paths.  The shiny object vanished from sight, and the jets crossed back and forth for several minutes afterwards.;35.5114;-92.0430000000001
