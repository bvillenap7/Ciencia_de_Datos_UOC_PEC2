disc shape hovering above Searcy, AR;2010-01-06 21:15:00;1 hour;disc shape hovering above Searcy, AR I was at the local coffeehouse with a friend of mine (we are students at the local university). We met a professor who was leaving the coffeehouse too. We started walking back to campus together. Suddenly our professor shouted out and we tried to see what she was pointing at. Though it was completely dark (it was around 9pm) we could definitely see lights from the town reflecting on something above us. It was perfectly still hovering above us. It looked like a large shallow disc shape...maybe 50 or 60 ft up? there were faint lights on it that were pulsing and an extremely faint humming noise. At first we couldn't believe what we were seeing since none of us are really UFO people, but after a minute or two it was definitely still there.  We all tried to get a photo of it with our cellphones but it started slowly moving away and it was way too dark.  Just a few seconds later we could barely see it anymore and trees got in the way and it was gone.;35.2435743589744;-91.7311051282051
