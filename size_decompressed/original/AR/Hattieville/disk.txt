Spotted in a rural area, disappeared as soon as cameras The object was disk/saucer shaped, had four lights, and was moving in a circular motion.  It seemed to be abnormally close to the ground until we got closer to it and it began to drift further away from us.  The object's color was unknown, yet it was aware that we were watching it.  The object, which was spotted in a rural area was completely soundness.  My friends and I, who are all teenagers, spotted this object around 10pm at night when we were driving home from a night out.  Never seeing anything like this, we were absolutely terrified.  After arriving home, we went outside to see if we could spot the object again, we could see it from a very far distance, but noticed other airplanes which seemed to be chasing the object.;35.2869;-92.779
