stationary blue/green orb quickly shot off to the South-Southwest;2003-10-18 23:20:00;5 seconds;stationary blue/green orb quickly shot off to the South-Southwest I was returning to my home and as I made the turn onto my street, I saw a greenish/blue orb stationary for an instant...then shot off quickly Southwest out of my field of view. There was no contrail or any sort of residue trail in the sky. I would have instantly thought it to be a meteor had it not been stationary...I thought it was a slow moving plane with landing lights on since there is an airport nearby in Jonesboro.;35.9063;-90.7846
