Football-field size triangular object--low and silent.;2016-03-08 20:39:00;2-3 minutes;Football-field size triangular object--low and silent. My son came into my bedroom around 9:30 pm, very excited, asking why I hadn't answered his phone call.  I told him my phone was charging in the living room.   He told me that as he was driving to his grandfather's house, he noticed 3 lights, and at first thought they were military aircraft flying in formation.  Then, he noticed something was odd with the lighting and took a closer look.   He stopped his truck and got out of the vehicle to observe a large triangular object.  He described it as 2-3 football fields big.  He said he was scared and his heart was racing.  He said it was completely silent as it slowly passed overhead.   I talked to his grandfather this evening.  His grandfather said when he arrived at his house he was excited and told him the entire story.  I asked why he didn't get pics or video, but his reply was that he was too busy calling me, trying to get me to come outside so I could see it.    Today, my son tells me he can't believe what he saw and ! seems very reluctant to talk about it.;35.4559292682927;-94.330312195122
