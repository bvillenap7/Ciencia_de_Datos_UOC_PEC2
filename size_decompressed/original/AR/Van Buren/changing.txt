Strange Lights Hovering and Breaking Into Multiple Different Lights over Van Buren, AR;2008-05-16 21:45:00;5 Minutes;Strange Lights Hovering and Breaking Into Multiple Different Lights over Van Buren, AR While sitting at the Van Buren High School Graduation, I noticed a white light, almost a large teardrop shape, falling toward the earth very slowly.  It stopped then started the fall again, slowly.  Then it suddenly broke into 6 pieces, which were more round than teardrop.  These pieces moved in a slow arc around the sky - this was all taking place just over the football scoreboard in the endzone, so it would have been looking toward the southwest - over the Arkanas River or in that area.  This happened several times, each time, the main light broke into pieces.  These hovered, some we could see, some went behind the scoreboard and were lost to our view in the trees.  Numerous people sitting near us were watching as well - some were even taping it on their camera.;35.4559292682927;-94.330312195122
