Fireball craft spotted in Maumelle, Arkansas heading South East.;2008-12-06 17:30:00;3 min.;Fireball craft spotted in Maumelle, Arkansas heading South East. I was traveling North on Maumelle Blvd.  I saw the craft to my right moving in a South Easterly direction.  It appeared to be a fireball type of craft, changing  Altitude dramatically.  I turned East onto a side road to get a better look and took another right and was now headed in a southerly direction. The object appeared again to my left, and seemed to move parallel with me for about 20 seconds. It then proceeded to gain altitude and I lost sight of it behind some trees. The craft appeared to be spherical with a sort of fire flicker to it.  I saw and chased the craft for several minutes and was never able to identify anything distinguishing it from a plane or helicopter. There were no colored lights, no blinking lights, and it changed altitude too fast for anything terrestrial. The object also did not make a sound from what I could tell.;34.8504;-92.4089
