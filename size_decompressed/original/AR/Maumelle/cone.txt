A HUGE comet (?) in the western sky slid from north to south at a forty-five degree angle, seemingly slower than normal.  The body was a vivid medium shade of green which faded into the golden orange tail ending in the usual white trail until it burned out.  I am a truck driver with eighteen plus years watching the skys all over this country and beyond.  I was stopped westbound at a red light approaching my final delivery destination and saw the sight straight out in front of me through my windshield in a well-lite business & residential area with countless motorist all about.  Also, a little higher in the western sky and a little further away, I saw what appeared to be a small private airplane.  Surely, I could not have been the only witness to this dramatic.;34.8504;-92.4089
