I was driving on I-40 west near the Maumelle exit when I noticed two bright lights traveling towards the highway.  At first I thought they must have been landing lights on an aircraft.  The lights began to rapidly descend and suddenly a straight line of silver lights appeared across the middle of the two larger lights. The object gained speed as it crossed the highway, the two main lights appeared to split apart and the two objects disappeared over the trees. I drove about a quarter mile or so when the two lights reappeared from over the trees.  The two large lights appeared to be reconnected with five somewhat smaller lights under the object with them.  Three in front and two in back, forming a circle with the larger lights.  A chain of silver lights formed the outline of a broad chevron around the circle of larger lights. As I began to see the details of the object l pulled off the highway and searched for my phone.  As I was doing this it made two tight circles in front of me.   Just as I got my phone out and pointed it at the object all but the biggest two lights dimmed and the object took off at a high speed towards the northeast.  Unfortunately, before I could get the camera set. Traffic was light at that hour, but it was near a populated area so it's likely someone else may have noticed the objects as well.;34.8504;-92.4089
