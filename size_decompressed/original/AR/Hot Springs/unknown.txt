Glowing clearlike color hovering over Lake Hamilton;2003-10-23 23:00:00;approx 5 min;Glowing clearlike color hovering over Lake Hamilton Was on the Mount Reonte and just chilling, talking and there is a airport in central hot springs.. always small aircraft mainly private planes fly from there, but I kept my eye on this wierd color shaped like a doughnut, this wasn't no aircraft that I ever seen, my friends were with me and we starred at it a good 5 minutes, it just hovered not even 6,000 feet above ground, and we try to trace it but it.. but then changed course and hover back near Lake Hamilton. Couldn't explain the shape to well or light patterns, it was a radical color, never seen a color like it.. almost glowed like a clear bubble. Don't know but I always hear strange stories on ufos in hot springs area.  Especially when going deer hunting near El Dorado... always see some type of light or wierd shaped object.  If I was Hot springs residents I would keep a eye in the sky.;34.5345911504425;-93.025678761062
Sighted two bright objects which moved and suddenly became motionless;2008-04-07 21:30:00;1 hour;Sighted two bright objects which moved and suddenly became motionless I am a 21 year old male, and have lived in Hot Springs since I was born.  I have always loved the outdoors, and have been fascianted with the skies for as long as I can remember.  I was not intoxicated on this night, nor was I feeling particularly emotional or tired.  Facing west on ravenwood place, I see an object moving to the south which glowed with a hazy red light, moving quickly on what appeared to be a western bearing, and getting closer to the earth very slowly.  At this time the object appeared to be extremely far away.  My first instinct told me it was a comet or something similar, based mostly on the fact that it seemed to be too far away to be in the atmosphere.  It also appeared to have fiery red tail at this time, although what I saw as a tail may have just been my eyes blurring the image trying to maintain focus as it moved.  Within a minute or so of seeing the red object to the south, I see what first appears to be a very bright star, with a bluish white color, directly to the west of me.  When I noticed that the light from the bluish white object appeared to be flickering slightly, I moved to a place in the road where neither of the objects would be obscured by trees.  After getting a clear perspective, I saw that the bluish white object was still flickering slightly, and was moving slowly to the south, then began to slowly bobb back and forth (south to north) as well as up and down, and I turned my attention back to the red object, which was now to the southwest of me.  Now able to see both objects simultaneously from the aforementioned perspective, they both seem to be much closer than they had when I was looking at them separately.  When viewed seperately they appeared to be at least two hundred miles away, if not much farther.  When I had them in a single visual frame, they appeared to be be between 50 and 100 miles away.  After the red object reaches the point to the southwest of me, it appears to begin moving north, which makes me think it may have been making a wide clockwise circle, starting from the south, and ending in the west, almost directly above the bluish white object.  With both objects to the west of me, the bluish white object appears to be maybe 5 - 20 miles high, with the red object about 10 - 40 miles above it, and they still seem to be 50 - 100 miles away from me.  After coming almost directly above the bluish white object, the red object starts descending towards the bluish white object, without pausing or altering it's speed.  The bluish white object then appeared to ascend up towards the red object, although much slower than the red object descended  I would have dismissed the bluish white object as a plane or helicopter after seeing it move, but it seemed to be much too high for a helicopter, and seemed to be moving far too slowly to be a non-harrier airplane.  After coming to the realization that these two objects were not inanimate, and were moving towards one another, my vision began to shake slightly as I strained to comprehend what I was seeing. When the red object seemed to be no more than 5 - 10 miles above the bluish white object, both objects stopped moving suddenly and quite simultaneously.  At this time I became completly amazed at what I was seeing.  Both of the objects were staying far too still to just be moving directly towards or away from me.  As astonished as I was by then I really can't remember how long both objects stayed perfectly still, but it was at least 30 seconds, if not 4 or 5 minutes.  I was outside maybe 5 - 10 minutes total during the aforementioned sightings, and when I went back inside I believe the objects were still motionless in the same positions.  I came back outside about 30 - 50 minutes later, and the objects appeared to be in about the same place, and shortly thereafter the red object started ascending away from the bluish white object.  After reaching its original altitude if not a higher one, it started moving to the east, being almost direcltly over me at one point, but still about 10 miles to the north of me.  It was moving extremely fast, and I heard a sonic boom about 20 seconds behind it.  When it passed above me it seemed to be at an altitude of 5 - 10 miles.  With the red object much closer than it had previously been, I could tell that it had 2 red lights opposite one another, which did not flash or flicker.  There was a yellow light directly in between the two red lights that was flashing on and off, every second or so. There was a second yellow light directly in front of the first, which did not flash or flicker.  I couldn't see anything of the craft except for the lights, which appeared to be (based on a normal airplane frame) posiitoned on the wings (red lights), one on or near the underside of the nose (steady yellow light) and on the underside of the craft directly in between the wings.  I then turned my attention back to the bluish white object, which now appeared to be moving north again, to where I first saw it.  The bluish white object stayed in the same area flickering, and I went inside after watching the bluish white object stay in the same place for a few minutes, and noted that the red object still seemed to be moving very quickly in an easterly direction.  I went back inside at approximately 10:30 pm (cst) and didn't go back outside that night.  My overall feelings from the event are that the red object may very well have been a  military aircraft, as the pattern of lights was fairly normal, and the sound of the sonic boom seemed similar to other sonic booms I've heard that weren't associated with an unusual sighting.  I don't know much about aircraft, but if the red object was a man made craft, it had to be some type of harrier, as it definitely stayed perfectly still for no less than 30 seconds, at an altitude of no less than 30,000 feet.  Since I didn't get as close of a look at the bluish white object, I really can't speculate as to what it was, but it stayed in the same area, moving no more than 35 degrees from a given perspective.;34.5345911504425;-93.025678761062
Red/Blue/Green lights flashing very quickly;2010-10-29 01:30:00;10 minutes;Red/Blue/Green lights flashing very quickly Around 1:30 in the morning, I went outside to let my dog use the bathroom as I always do before I go to bed. I looked up at the moon, and something to the right of the moon immediately caught my attention. It was a small point of light in the sky, roughly the same size as Jupiter but noticeably brighter and changing VERY quickly between red/green/blue colors. After scanning the rest of the sky to get an idea of how a few bright stars were twinkling I realized I could probably get a better look at these lights through my telescope, so I went inside and gathered my telescope and three different optics pieces. I also grabbed my digital camera, which I used together with my telescope to capture some video and two still shots. I observed the lights for about ten minutes total before going back inside.;34.5345911504425;-93.025678761062
