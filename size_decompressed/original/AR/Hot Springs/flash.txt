It flashes very fast, stobelike, not like the steady blink of a planes landing gear. Sometimes it moves in a line, sometimes it is stationary. It blinks out after a short time. Usually see it about a minute or less. There are other lights in the area a radio tower and The Hot Springs Tower. I also see planes in the sky. But this is different and I see one almost every night. It is a blinking light, white or yellow in color. Round shape but more of a flash of light. Doesn't appear to be solid to me. Most often it is moving in a straight line. It almost seems as though it knows I see it because as I look at it, it blinks out.;34.5345911504425;-93.025678761062
