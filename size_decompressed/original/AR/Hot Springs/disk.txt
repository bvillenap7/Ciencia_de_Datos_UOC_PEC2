Arkansas grocery store clerk and older gentleman get airshow by eight unknown craft.;2001-03-23 19:33:00;3 minuets;Arkansas grocery store clerk and older gentleman get airshow by eight unknown craft. I was at work pulling shopping carts inside as pre my job requirements, when an older gentleman said 'What the HELL!' Concerned for customer saftey I looked arround and saw the gentleman looking into the sky. I looked up also. About 500 feet in the air were eight crafts that appeared to be making high speed ninety degree (90 degree) turns.  The gentleman noticed me watching and asked me if I saw them too. I replied with a 'yes sir and then proceeded to ask him, 'What are they?''. He replied 'I dunno.'  We watched these acrobatic crafts for almost seven minuets before six of them shot off to the north at a astounding rate of speed. The othe two craft just sat and hovered for a minuet or so and then shot off tho the west just as fast as the six to the north did. I have seen aircraft like F-16's make turns but not as sharp or perfectly cornered as these craft seemed to be doing.;34.5345911504425;-93.025678761062
