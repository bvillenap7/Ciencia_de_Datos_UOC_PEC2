I, my Dad, and my Uncle were on Lake Ouachita on a pontoon boat looking up at the stars. My Dad pointed out a solid white light moving across the sky. My Uncle and I saw the figure too. We thought it was a satellite but then it came across the opposite way and we thought it was weird a satellite would do that. So we keep looking on for about an hour and we see approximately 13 or 14 more of these objects. We were looking in the sky, my dad bent over to get a drink and two extremely bright lights sucked out of the moving object and were, from my estimate, about 75 to a hundred feet away. The lights were blinding and eerie looking it gave me chills. Just when we thought we had seen it all another object moved across the night sky. And coming the opposite way was three of the solid white lights moving in a triangular formation, distorting the stars behind the U F O. We watched that for about 2 and half to 3 minutes and all of the sudden the front light of the object disappeared then the back left then the back right. I have never believed in U F Oâ€™s or extra terrestrials until I saw this. I was stunned and caught speechless. My dad, my uncle, and I always are logical people and try to find a reason or what it could be but we could not explain this.;34.5345911504425;-93.025678761062
