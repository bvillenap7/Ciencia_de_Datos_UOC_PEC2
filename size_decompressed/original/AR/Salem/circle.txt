Brillant object over baseball game for 2 hours;2002-06-20 00:00:00;3 hours;Brillant object over baseball game for 2 hours I was had my son's baseball game, and it was quite late.  All other games at the park were over and all the lights were off but his game in progress.  I was sitting in my car in the parking lot when I happened to look up and to the left.  There was a huge bright glowing light just about 1,000 feet about the trees.  I was shocked, there was no sound at all and the light was so bright you could not look straight had it. After watching it for about thirty minutes I could see red lights around it.  It would float across the sky. It stayed there the whole 3 hours I was in the parking lot.    When the game was over, I thought great somebody will see the object but as soon as the game ended,the object floated off west of me.  I watched the object for 2 and half to 3 hours.
