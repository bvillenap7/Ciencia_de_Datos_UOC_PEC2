Bright light and gray aircraft flying low and quietly on a summer night.;2012-06-25 10:30:00;3 minutes;Bright light and gray aircraft flying low and quietly on a summer night. Tonight my husband and I were outside taking an evening swim and while floating on top of the water noticed a bright light moving quickly and rather low compared to the airplanes we had seen previously while being out there.  As it got closer I noticed it looked as if it had some sort of spotlight that I saw shine twice. It did not shine down on the ground from where I was at but I did see the light in the air. No lights were blinking on the aircraft and it was not making any noise that we could hear. As it flew by the light that was only shining, in what I believed to be the front of the craft, lit up enough that I saw it was a grayish color and appeared to be a disk shape with something on top.  A couple of days before this we had seen another light like this one and didn't really know what is was. However it was not flying as low as this one.  When I mentioned this to my daughter and her friend they has seen a strange light also on the other side of town.  This area has also been experiencing some electrical power outages in a neighboring community.  After seeing this it made me wonder if they could be related. I have never seen anything like this and have no idea what it is. It scared me and I hope to not see it again but felt it should be reported.;35.2966;-93.7198
