I was out on my nightly run, when reached the parking lot of the high school and stopped to take a breath, and noticed moving objects in the sky.  I only saw them for maybe 10 seconds and they were moving like fireflies, but you could tell that they were far away.    I believe that they were white or yellowish colored.  I think that there were anywhere from 5-10 of the possible UFOâ€™s.  I do remember seeing a small reddish colored cloud just after I saw the objects disappeared.   I remember having a shrunken feeling when I saw them, but that might be irrelevant.   I don't know what direction i was facing but I was at the corner of Hendrix st. and N. Hickory st. Turns out a few of my other friends saw them too. One claimed to have called. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed to us to be serious-minded and credible.
