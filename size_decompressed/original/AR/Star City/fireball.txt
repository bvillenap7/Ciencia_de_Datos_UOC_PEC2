Green Fireball jets across the night sky.;2015-05-05 22:30:00;~3 seconds;Green Fireball jets across the night sky Me and my friend were traveling north on US HWY 425 from monnticello to Star City, when we were about 4-6 miles out from Star City, we noticed a green fireball jet across the sky, it looked like it was headed downward towards earth and not across the sky.   When we got home I found out that about the same time the cats of our neighborhood were acting crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
