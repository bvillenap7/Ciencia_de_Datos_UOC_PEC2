We were looking up at the stars and I was pointing out different constelations to her when we saw it.  It was behind the clouds and sitting perfectly still for about 3 seconds off to the west.  Then in an instant it shot across the sky to the north.  It did not seem to accelerate it just went from sitting still to speeding across the sky.  She then asked me if I had just seen it and we both had and then went back inside. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness means a date in 2004.  We will query him on this point.  PD));36.104;-93.7249
