Electric humming & unusual dog howls First I heard this weird electrical humming sound and looked up at the sky and saw what I thought could be a plane. It started getting closer and was flying lower than a plane would, and the two people I was with started looking as well. It didn’t sound like the engine of a plane. I couldn’t take my eye off it the whole time and neither could they. It had 4 white lights in a diamond shape and the 4th light on the back of the diamond shape was slowly fading in and out from white to yellow. It wasn’t flashing the way a plane would. After it almost passes over us it turns maybe 25° right abruptly. Pretty soon after all the dogs around us (in three separate places) howled for a second or two and were silent. It didn’t seem like normal animal behavior so we left real fast. As we were leaving we heard a plane go over us and it didn’t sound like what went over us. The sound was also delayed from the plane but not from the UFO.;36.104;-93.7249
