UFO Circular light formation 6-16-2012 sighting @ midnight;2012-06-17 00:00:00;1 minute;RE:  UFO Circular light formation 6-16-2012 sighting @ midnight   My  sighting which was on last Saturday night 6-16-12 and from my home in St. Joe, AR, at midnight out my front window I saw in the north sky, I observed a large circular light formation with a center light all glowing 9-fluorescent-green lights/orbs in total 8, forming the outside circle and 1 in the center, evenly spaced, and moving slowly east (from west to east) like a wheel moving but not rolling the lights were stationary and all moving in unison towards the east from the west. I ran to get my camera, after being sure of what I saw and observing clearly what I was seeing for about 1 minute--I returned and went out the front door and the orbs were gone, I waited awhile, but they didnâ€™t return, so I went back inside. As best indicated below:  The fluorescent-green orbs seemed to be the size of baseballs up in the night sky like the size of a huge ferris-wheel, but not rolling.
