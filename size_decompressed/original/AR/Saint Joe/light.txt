It then stopped, grew really bright, and then dim, and dropped approx. 1000 ' in altitude.  It then went bright again and shot off perpendicular to its drop in altitude and (Think 'L')stopped.   At this point it dimmed to almost nothing, and then changed to a reddish color and shot off at an angle of maybe 15Â° upwards and disappeared.;35.9877;-92.7928
