This evening my wife and I were in our backyard comenting on what a clear night it was when I noticed a very large, white/gray v shaped flying object. When I told my wife to look in the same direction, she noticed it immediately! The object was flying south east and made no sound at all and there where no lights visible. We observed it for about 15 seconds then we lost sight of it when it passed behind some trees. There is an Air Force base just north of Little Rock.;34.7458766884533;-92.3758978213508
