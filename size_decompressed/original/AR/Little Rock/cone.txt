cone-shaped craft fell silently to the ground 5/28/2018;2018-05-28 20:25:00;~20 seconds;cone-shaped craft fell silently to the ground 5/28/2018 Little Rock, AR  My friends and I have been watching this cone or triangular shaped craft for over a month.  For quite a while it seemed to be an unfamiliar constellation...very high in the sky. Over the days it has become more and more visible. Tonight 5/28/2018, at approx 8:25 it was very low in the sky when it suddenly began to drop straight to the ground without making a sound. I happened to be looking at it when this took place. I was completely speechless and unable to call out to my friends. When it was higher it seemed more Christmas tree shaped wih several big lights or craft at each corner and in between points. Tonight as it fell the shape was completely visible. Cone shaped top then straight sides with numerous lights or craft. There was complete silence as it fell. It seemed to be extremely close to us. As it fell past the trees I could no longer see it. I had no was of getting to it so I immediately googled for similar sightings. I expect to hear something on the news tonight. I can't describe my feelings. Whatever it was has been one of the most amazing, overwhelming things that I've witnessed in my life. I hope to see more recent sightings here. the sightings in Mena AR and Fort Smith sound very similar. CC N;34.7458766884533;-92.3758978213508
