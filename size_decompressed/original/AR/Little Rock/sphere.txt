two huge amber, orange orbs flew over my house.;2011-09-27 20:00:00;1 minute;two huge amber, orange orbs flew over my house. Ever night  at 8:00  I go out in my back to take my dog out.. I am a stargazier, so I looked up, as I do every night. I saw to the southwest of me, two huge glowing amber, orange orbs. The orbs were very low, not much higher than trees.  I was so shocked. The orbs were the same size, the same width apart.  They were flying together like the were on the back of a craft. I could not see a craft.  The orbs went behind a tree and I ran to the end of my yard, and watched the orbs gain speed and height, until they were out if sight.  This sighting could not be mistaken for any manmade craft that we have. Their was no sound at all.  The orbs did not shine any light on the trees.  One other weird thing.  Every dog in the neighborhood was going crazy.  My dog was running around in circles, completely out of control. Later that night I found out that other people reported seeing the orbs also.  Their were several planes and hhelocopers.  Chasing after the orbs.;34.7458766884533;-92.3758978213508
