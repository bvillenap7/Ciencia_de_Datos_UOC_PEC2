Beware.;2010-11-22 23:00:00;5-10;Beware. It was about eleven at night and me and my friend were going home from our office. we were walking down the street about to grab a bite to eat when we looked up and SAW IT. it was a egg shapped figure in the sky. ther were lights that showed no reflection in the sky. it came from the east to the west and it seemed to stop in the dead center of the sky. when we went to get out our cellphones to take pictures the egg shaped aircraft zoomed away at lightning speed and we sat there dumbfounded.  beware this could happen to you.;34.7458766884533;-92.3758978213508
