On this particular evening, I was sitting on my stoop with one of my cats in my lap.  My neck started getting stiff so I was looking up and down trying to relieve the stiffness.  When I looked up I saw an orange object moving across the sky.  It was definitely NOT an airplane.  It did not have the after effect (chalk looking streak)you normally see after a jet.  There was no sound accompaning this object. It moved through the sky in a constant motion. When my view was obstructed by some trees I moved into an open area to try to get a better look at it sand this is when I lost site of it. I moved to a different area,also open, and tried to resume looking at it. It was no where to be found. There were no flashing lights, no aura's around it, just a solid orange object moving through the sky.;34.7458766884533;-92.3758978213508
