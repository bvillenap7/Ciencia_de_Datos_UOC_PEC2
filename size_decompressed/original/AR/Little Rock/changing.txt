Green lights above West Little Rock.;2007-10-14 21:14:00;15 Seconds;Green lights above West Little Rock. On Sunday night, October 14,2007, I was driving home after visiting a friend near Perryville (where I have seen numerous craft before) and was headed south on 430, about to merge onto 630 when I saw a small green light speedily heading towards the ground over what looked like the Walnut Valley area of W. Little Rock. Before disappearing into the trees (or disappearing completely?)the green light broke into approximately 4 pieces. At arms length, this craft or light would have been about as big (or as thick) as a #2 pencil and about 4 inches long. At first siting, it was located approx. 50-75 feet above the ground and when it disappeared was just at the tree-line.;34.7458766884533;-92.3758978213508
