White object moving with the wind;2007-08-31 14:25:00;2 minutes;White object moving with the wind This sighting was on 8/31/07 from near the Pulaski County line in SW Little Rock. The time was 2:24 PM CDT, the sky was unusually clear, and the wind was from the NNE. I had an unobstructed view of the sky. Looking to the NNE, I saw something approaching in the sky, about 20 degrees above the horizon, that I thought was a piece of paper blowing in the wind. It was bright white. I noticed what I thought was a jet and contrail behind it in the far distance when I first saw it, but could not resolve it.  It did not tumble, except once or twice it dimmed as if it might be tumbling. I thought it might be a bird, but it was clearly not acting like a bird, in that it was not dimming and brightening regularly like a bird would do flapping its wings. It seemed to be simply blowing in the wind. Fortunately, I had a camera, and took some pictures of it. The photos do not clear up what it is, however. It moved overhead and I lost it in the sun. I only saw it for a couple of minutes. It appeared to be far up, at least 2000 feet. I also took a photo of a jet with the same camera settings for comparison.;34.7458766884533;-92.3758978213508
