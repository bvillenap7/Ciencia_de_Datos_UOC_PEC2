It looked like a big bright star in the sky, except it was lower to the ground and so bright that it couldn't have been a star. it seemed to be spinning in place and glowing of red and blue light. overall most of the light was white and it was very pretty.  My girlfried, brother, and I all watched it for the second time. we seen it for the first time about two nights ago on the 29th of May.;36.4172;-94.4744
