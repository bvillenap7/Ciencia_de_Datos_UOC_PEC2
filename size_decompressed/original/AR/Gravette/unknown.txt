Red, blue and white flashing light hovering hundreds of feet in the air.;2009-08-30 23:00:00;30 minutes;Red, blue and white flashing light hovering hundreds of feet in the air. Went out tonight to get some air and my eyes fell on a red, blue and white flashing light through the trees and above the neighbor's house. The actual craft would have been hundreds of feet in the air and over Sulpher Springs, Missouri.  I watched it for roughly 30 minutes as it seemed at times to have a tough time staying in the air and it seemed to sink very slowly towards the earth. after it eventually disappeared, I stayed to see if it would come back and it didn't.;36.4172;-94.4744
