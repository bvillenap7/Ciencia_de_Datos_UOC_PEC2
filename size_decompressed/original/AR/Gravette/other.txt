Two moving objects in space;2009-06-15 22:00:00;5 minutes;Two moving objects in space It was a clear night and I could see an object in space moving very quickly, like that of a satelite as seen in space by a human being on earth.  Then I noticed there was a second object hundreds of miles away from the first object, both moving in complete and utter sinc with each other.  It was two objects, because there were stars between them, but they seemed to mirror one another, never differing in distance from one another, both moving jaggedly but in complete sinc with one another, through space.  It struck me as the oddest thing I've ever seen.  Speaking nothing of the strangeness of their movements at such obvious distance from eachother, the things resembled satelites in color and size.  The whole thing lasted less than 5 minutes, until they were out of site beyond the tree line.;36.4172;-94.4744
