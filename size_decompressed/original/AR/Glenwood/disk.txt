I had come home from a long day at school and discovered I had to run into town to pick up something to prepare for dinner. I got about a half a mile down the road and glanced up into the sky at my right and saw a bright shiney silver object suspended in the sky. Close enough I could tell it wasn't a plane or even shaped like one for that matter. It was shaped like a disk with a well rounded egg in the middle. I went home after going to the store and reported the event to my husband, and I was laughed at. So I summed it up to being delusional due to lack of sleep. It wasn't until a saw a special on tv last week on UFO'S that I decided to tell someone. At that time they showed the exact same object as I saw, which in away convinced me I'm not crazy. And ever since I witnessed the object hovering, strange things have been happening around my house electrical apliances coming on for no reason etc... E mail me if youre intrested in hearing more. I wouldn't swear this event happened in Oct. My life moves in semesters and all I know for sure is it was last semester. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.3209;-93.5522
