Never seen anything like it. Can’t explain it.;2019-11-03 20:00:00;3 minutes;Never seen anything like it. Can’t explain it. I was sitting in my living room and noticed a glowing orange sphere out my front door in the sky.  It approached from the east and seemed between 2,000-3,000 ft in the air and moved in a straight line at a relatively slow speed, stopped and hovered then left towards the north at an unbelievably high rate of speed, basically vanished!  There was no sound whatsoever.  It lasted about 3 minutes.;36.2741;-92.5383
