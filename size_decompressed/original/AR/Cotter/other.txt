Lights flashing in a row, noises too loud for aircraft and for its size. Shape was triangle/oval, it was pointy at the top and around the sides it was oval shaped.  It had a bunch of lights on it, lights around the side were white one of them was red.  They weren’t really flashing, it was more like the old light up movie marquee or mirror.  The lights were a constant moving in a oval, there was a red flashing light around the top pointy part.  Right next to that light was a white light, that wasn’t flashing.  It was maybe as big, or a bit smaller than a Vizio flatscreen TV.  But was bigger than a drone.  The noises were deep and loud, unlike any aircraft.  The noises sounded bigger than the object itself was. Too deep and too loud to be an airplane or jet.  It flew tilted, almost diagonally.  The front part was tilted downwards, it was longer than the top and the backend.  Kinda like a boomerang, but filled in all the way.  Not a triangle.  It was flying fairly close to where we were sitting, just below the tree tops.  If it would of came clos! er, it probably would of been way bigger than what we were seeing.  It was almost fully making a circle around the area we were in.  All the dogs nearby were freaking out more than normal. It acted like it was observing us, kinda like a drone.  And seemed to be looking at us.  This occurred in an open area with surrounding trees, in the back of the high school in the area. It happened around 9:40 pm and lasted around 5 minutes.;36.2741;-92.5383
