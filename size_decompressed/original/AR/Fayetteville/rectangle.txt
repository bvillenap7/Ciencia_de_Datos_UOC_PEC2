Trajectory was heading N.W. over Fayetteville, AR toward Joplin, MO.  Sorry, don't think this was a UFO per se, but was a notable event in the sky... quite bright (about 1/2 as bright as a full moon!).;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999

I still can’t wrap my head around it. 4.19.20 1:35 am I captured a recording on an iPad with Presenceapp (used as security and fun wildlife viewing on our mountaintop) - the ipad was perched horizontally in kitchen window behind wooden blinds.

This experience shook me and 4 months later I’m still often lost in thought. I’ve tried to recreate any single aspect and I can’t.;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999
