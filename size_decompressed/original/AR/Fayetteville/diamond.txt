4 flashing white lights in a diamond pattern and then there were 5;2020-08-25 21:00:00;30-45 seconds;4 flashing white lights in a diamond pattern and then there were 5 I was sitting out on my back porch when some lights in the sky caught my attention, I looked up and saw 4 very bright lightsâ€¦.the only way to explain is to think about the flash going off on a camera and when the flash is at its brightest is what these 4 lights looked like.  As I was watching them fly in a perfect diamond formation one of the lights started to flash, although it was not the light itself flashing but it flashed a light on the right side (3 really quick flashes) then the lights flashed on the front(again 3 really quick flashes) 3 flashes on the left side then finally 3 flashes on the back.  As that light finished its flashes the other 3 did the exact same flash pattern.  As these lights began to move out of sight I saw a fifth light that just appeared out in front of the other 4 and began flashing its lights in the exact same pattern.;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999
