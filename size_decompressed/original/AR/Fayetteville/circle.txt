I was walking my dog, when I noticed a weird white light over across the big field from where I live, just hovering. So I immediately thought there must've been a new light installed on a phone tower or something in that area. Only this white light had two smaller lights, one red, one blue, rotating around it in a circle, alternating lights. I just began to think nothing of it, and started back inside, but my dog pulled me back the other way, and as I looked back up to where it was, it had moved towards my direction, and was still moving. At this point, I thought well maybe it's plane, but that didn't explain why it was hovering before, nor did it explain the red and blue white spinning around it. So I watched it for a couple more minutes as it came towards me, and then is stopped. It stopped again in mid-air, and hovered for maybe 30 seconds, and then started moving again, only this time heading East, the whole time with the red and blue lights spinning around it. I watched it until it was out of my line of vision behind other houses and trees.  This craft emitted absolutely no sound whatsoever. I've seen planes and helicopters around here. The planes are NEVER this low to the ground, and you always hear them. Same goes for helicopters. I'm in a valley, you'd hear anything up there. This thing was maybe 50 feet up, and made absolutely no sound whatsoever.;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999

She stated it was moving to fast to be the I.S.S. and that it could only be viewed at specific times.  This was not one of those.  It moved quickly through the sky, higher than commercial air traffic.  The object than paused and shot directly up/away.  You could tell it was moving up or away because the light dimming as distance passed.  We we're both in shock and now are very much believers.  We both told each other, dear god, I was glad someone else saw that.;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999
