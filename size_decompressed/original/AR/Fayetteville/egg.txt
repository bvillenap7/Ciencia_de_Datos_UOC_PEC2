Black walnut shaped craft observed in broad daylight floating across sky with no sound;2012-05-18 17:30:00;10 minutes;Black walnut shaped craft observed in broad daylight floating across sky with no sound It was after work on a week day, I stepped out into the backyard to enjoy the nice weather while I was talking on the phone with my grandmother-in-law. I had sat down in my lawn chair facing North and while talking on phone I noticed out of the corner of my left eye, which would have been to the West, what appeared at first to be a bird that was gliding. The wind was blowing out of the North and it was like when a bird faces into the wind and is able to just hold its wings out and kind of stay in one spot while riding the current of the wind. After about 30 seconds of noticing the object I realized that this thing was moving slowly but with no movement (wings flapping).  I looked over at object and to my big surprise it was not a bird but only what I could describe as a solid black walnut shape. It seemed to be so close, but is hard to say how far away from me it was.   I dropped the phone in amazement, not caring about the phone call no longer, knowing I wo! uld never witness this again. In fact, it was the weirdest feeling because my brain would not register what I was looking at. I watched this object fly into the Northeast direction, with absolutely no sound associated with the craft at all, until it dissappeared into the clouds. It stayed at the same speed the entire time of the observation, and since it moved across my vision from southwest to northeast, there were plenty of angles to tell that in did not have any wings.  I still to this day can not believe and will never forget this expereince, since it happened in broad daylight! I have seen plenty of odd acting lights in the sky over the years, knowing they were not of anything mankind has produced...at least publicly. From what I think the distance was from my position on the ground, the craft must have been around 25 to 50 feet in diameter.
