Well we just finished shooting of fireworks on grandpa's farm east of town, and I decided to walk away from the family with my friends in to the patch of woods away from the pasture to enjoy the warm night for a few minutes.  As we headed into the woods we noticed a light about 100 yards in front of us, and we thought someone was being stupid and shooting stuff off in the woods so we moved that way.   As we approached, this is what we saw:  Three triangular shaped craft were sitting in a break in the trees.  Lights were pointing down off each point of the trianles and were pointing towards the ground.  The strange beings that piloted these ships were conferencing outside.  They were tall and had very thick hair that covered their body, and seemed to speak tonally.   As we approached they smelled the air and glared in our direction.  Although, they never saw us, they sensed and smelled danger, and quickly ran to there ships and exploded into the night.  I use the word explosion, but there really wasn't any sound.  It was just a instant burst of light and then we were knocked to the ground.  But I got a glimpse of the crafts, as they sped from sight, and they seemed to elongate as they accelerated.   We kept the encounter to ourselves and have rarely spoken of it.;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999
Small white changing object seen flying curving path in blue sky.

Object seen straight overhead -followed to horizon.  6:14pm Arkansas My wife and I arrived home from work between 6:11 and 6:14 PM (Central) I looked into the sky straight up and slightly northeast. I saw a commercial air plane flying East at high altitude. The plane was leaving a dissapating contrail. I saw a very white object that I first thought was a lone white crane (bird). I thought it was this type of bird because it was so white. The sun was obviously upon it. At first sight it also seemed to be 'flapping'. I have to rule out this object as a bird. Due to several reasons:  1. The 'flapping' was very irregular. 2. The 'bird' reached the far horizon in 60 seconds. 3. It was still visible through the haze of the horizon, towards the sun. (No bird could reflect that much light.) 3. The speed it reached the horizon combined with its altitude. 4. Odd pattern of flight. I rule out an aircraft. 1. No contrail.  2. Obviously different when compared to the airliner we saw at the same moment in the sky. 3. Path of flight was SE with several fairly rapid curves more easterly then more southerly then back to the SE. 4. The speed of the object.  5. The apparent 'flapping' which now can only be described as 'shape changing' as it went into the horizon. I rule out a satelite in orbit, or the space station, or space shuttle.  1.  The sky was still blue and the sun shining. Only something the size of the current space station could have reflected so much light.   2. The path of flight was not a staight line.  3. The space shuttles have been grounded for months. Across the street from me two spanish speaking gentlemen also witnessed the object. From their angle they could see it flying into the horizon and farther south for 10-15 seconds longer than I could.;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999
