Just after midnight, my girlfriend and I went out to smoke a cigarette.  We were on our balcony facing SW.  She noticed it first and we watched it for 45 seconds as it traveled from the South to SW.  It traveled from 180° to 240° in that time then dropped vertical behind the tree line.  Approximately 20 miles away.  Lighting was three to five orange lights, at first we saw three lights in a row but as it moved to the SW just before it dropped vertically the lights made a distinct V shape.   My girlfriend is a stay at home mom, and I'm an honorably discharged United States Marine Corps veteran.  We were both completely sober and in our right minds (which are currently going crazy now).;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999
