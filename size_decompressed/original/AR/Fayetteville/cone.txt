In the backdrop of a fading pink sky I noticed what I thought was a jet leaving airport.  Since it is just to the south of me that was my first thought.   That point I realized that there wasn't a sound being produced and it was headed towards the ground faster than a jet could travel or any man made craft for that matter.  Best way to describe it was a green fireball with greenish-whiteish tail/trail behind it.  Only lasted for a few seconds at the most.  I even waited for a crash or explosion sound to rule out any crash that could've happened.;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999
