silent dark object in the shape of a cross seen in Fayetteville, AR moving south.;2000-10-21 20:15:00;1-2 seconds;silent dark object in the shape of a cross seen in Fayetteville, AR moving south. As I was stretching out at the southwest end of the track on the UA campus, I happened to glance almost directly up an towards the south/southeast an noticed a very faint object moving silent and very rapidly directly to the south. At arm's lenth, it was approximately the size of a nickle or just a little larger. The object had no lights but appeared to be reflecting the burnt orange light from the sodium vapor lamps. From the brief sighting it seemed that it was not a solid craft like a plane, but rather a frame because the light reflected off of points that closely resembled a cross pattern, like a jet, but no sold body. I would guess that it traveled at the same altitude a cessna would but it moved much, much faster. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));36.070759375;-94.1807046874999
