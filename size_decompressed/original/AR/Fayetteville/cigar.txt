Ultra black, cigar shaped object streaks across night sky over Fayetteville, Arkansas;2005-09-29 20:45:00;10 seconds;Ultra black, cigar shaped object streaks across night sky over Fayetteville, Arkansas At 8:45 pm CST, while walking our dog, my wife and I spotted an ultra-black object in the sky, which was significantly darker than the background sky.   This object was cigar shaped and was moving rather briskly in a S.W. direction from the N.E. sky.  It took approximately 10-seconds for this object to traverse the sky and disappear behind the treeline.  The color was black, but far darker than any shade of black we've previously seen.   It was almost void of reflectivity, so much so that it's shape was clearly dilineated against the night sky (which by comparison seemed to be dark gray).   There were no clouds in the sky, only a modest wind of about 15 mph from the N.W., perpendicular to the motion of the object.   While the object could be characterized as cigar shaped it would have to have been a pretty fat cigar as it was almost a third of the way between a basic cylinder and a football in overall shape.  The front and back ends were brighter, with a steady but dim glow.  There was no apparent sound for this object.   After it was out of sight, we scanned the sky and found an airplane as a point-of-comparison.  The plane was clearly and significantly different from the object we had just seen.  The plane's shape could be seen against the night sky, but it was lighter in color than the background.  The plane also had strobing beacons that flashed quite brilliantly.  The plane also took about 45 seconds to traverse an area across the sky that was roughly the same number of arc degrees that the ultra-black object crossed in only 10-seconds.;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999
A red cigar-shaped UFO with a glow around it flys up into the sky;2006-05-09 16:00:00;10 minutes;A red cigar-shaped UFO with a glow around it flys up into the sky I was doing yardwork and I saw a large cigar-shaped red UFO hovering in the sky. It was emitting a red light. I told my freind and he came out and saw it. It moved to the left a ways and then flew straight up. I lost track of it.;36.070759375;-94.1807046874999
