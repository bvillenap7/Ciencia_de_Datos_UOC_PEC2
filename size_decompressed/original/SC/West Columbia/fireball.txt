One fireball seen over US1 in Lexington Co.;2017-08-17 21:30:00;5 minutes;One fireball seen over US1 in Lexington Co. I was outside right before getting ready for work.  I noticed a fireball in the sky.  We live close to the airport, so I knew it was much bigger than the planes we normally see over our house.  Also, because of the color, I thought, if it's a plane, it's on fire.   I called for my husband to come outside, and we could see 2 other aircraft in the sky, definitely airplanes.  It had to have been at least 10 times the size of them.   We watched as it travelled east for about three minutes, mainting its size and color, then literally disappeared.   My husband and and I are slow to believe in things like this, but unless it was a plane on fire, we really can't figure out what else it would be.
