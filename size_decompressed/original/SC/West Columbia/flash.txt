Soundless mysterious flashes of light in the southern sky;2009-10-22 23:45:00;about 5 minutes;Soundless mysterious flashes of light in the southern sky My boyfriend and myself were standing outside around 11:45 on the night of October 22 2009 facing south. All the dogs in the neighborhood were barking, when suddenly we saw an extremely bright flash of light on the southern skyline, which lit up about half of the sky. I looked at my watch to clock the time of the thunder so I could tell how far away the storm might be. About a minute later, I saw another flash of light in the same spot in the sky. Exactly one minute after that I saw the brightest flash of light, which lit up most of the sky. These flashes of light were blue and reddish in color. After that neither of us saw any more flashes of light. There never was any thunder either.Right after these flashes of light me and boyfriend witnessed most of the street lamps on my street start to flicker a white light. All of these lights are orange in color under normal circumstances. Around 12:00 am my boyfriend left to go back home (which is about 5 miles away). His roommate told him that most of the street lamps on their were flicker on an off and their lights had gone out. Even stranger, co-workers have said that they experienced electrical problems as well. My boyfriend's mother lost power at her house for close to 45 minutes after these strange flashes of light. She also happens to live closer (to the south of where I live) to where we saw the flashes of light. I do NOT believe this to be lightning because the light was only coming from a small point in the sky and the flash never seemed to try to reach the ground. The best way to describe the way this looked is to say that it looked like a giant transformer bursting in the middle of the southern sky.;33.9968978048781;-81.0878818292673
