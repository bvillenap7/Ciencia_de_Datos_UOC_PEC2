They were moving slower and at what seemed like a higher altitude than airplanes. We deduced this because several airplanes were in the sky at around the same time. Six of us saw the lights move in a general direction of west by southwest. The lights appeared to be in a triangular formation and several in front seemed to slow down for the remainder. The lights stopped moving and formed a generally straight line. Then, a few at a time, they began to dim down and disappear.;33.9968978048781;-81.0878818292673
