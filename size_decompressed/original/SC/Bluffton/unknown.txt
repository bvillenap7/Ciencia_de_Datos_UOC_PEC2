Ball of red/yellow light followed by a trail of fire falls to earth in or around Bluffton, SC;2011-10-01 23:41:00;20 seconds;Ball of red/yellow light followed by a trail of fire falls to earth in or around Bluffton, SC Was watching UFO in sky and changed direction to look at stars.  As I turned to look, I saw a red and yellow flash going from the sky to the earth.  It happened so quickly that I wasn't sure what I'd seen.  There was an object in front and a trail of fire (?) coming behind.  Object definitely came to earth with a tail of light behind it.  Don't know if this is a shooting star, meteorite, or what but following the sighting of UFO, I don't know what to believe.  I'm 59 years old and a financial officer in a company owned by my husband.  I was the only witness to this.;32.2514921052631;-80.8715543859649
