It was not exactly like a helicopter, but it had a sort of pulsating light and it was long so that's what we were calling it because of the hovering.  It could've been oval instead of triangular for all we know, close up. We stared at it trying to figure out what it was for about two minutes.  There are no houses or buildings or any other light source to explain what we were seeing.   It was just silently hovering and then as we were both watching it, it vanished.  POP!  We just looked at each other and didn't know what to think about it.  We have both heard about UFO stories, of course, but laughed and said that nobody would believe us. That's all there is to tell.;32.2514921052631;-80.8715543859649
Red lights in a triangle shape slowly moved across SC night sky!;2014-07-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;Red lights in a triangle shape slowly moved across SC night sky! I saw 3 reddish orange lights in the shape of a triangle. They were all moving together very slowly across the sky.  The UFO seemed very large or close to the ground. I heard fireworks off in the distance but nothing from the craft itself.  The lights did not blink like on a plane. I sat on the roadside and watched it slowly fade off into the night.  Its almost as if it was comfortable to be there because of all the other lights in the sky that night!  Like it was camouflaged.;32.2514921052631;-80.8715543859649

It was so loud that I went and opened my door to see what was going on.  I didnâ€™t see anything at eye level, so I looked up to the sky.   It was past my house, just to the left of me, moving quite fast and the noise continued.  Appearance.   Looked like either a huge plane or a tricycle, the back wheels had blue lights, in the front had red flashing lights.;32.2514921052631;-80.8715543859649
