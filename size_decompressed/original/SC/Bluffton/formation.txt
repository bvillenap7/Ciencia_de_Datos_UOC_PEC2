Last night around 20:50 pm, I heard a very loud noise that sounded like a heavy truck, i.e., (garbage or cement truck).  It was so loud that I went and opened my door to see what was going on.  I didnâ€™t see anything at eye level, so I looked up to the sky.   It was past my house, just to the left of me, moving quite fast and the noise continued.  Appearance.   Looked like either a huge plane or a tricycle, the back wheels had blue lights, in the front had red flashing lights.;32.2514921052631;-80.8715543859649
