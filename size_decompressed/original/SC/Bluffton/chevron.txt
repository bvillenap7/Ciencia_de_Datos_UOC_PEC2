Large white light with blue triangular glow sighted in Bluffton, SC sky;2011-10-01 22:50:00;ongoing;Large white light with blue triangular glow sighted in Bluffton, SC sky We had just come out of a friend's house and were walking home when we noticed a light that was too bright in the night sky.  We stopped to look and saw that the light was moving, horizontally then vertically at what seemed like a very fast rate.  As we continued to look at the light, we could see a triangular glow from the craft-looked blue in color.  The craft was very high up.   A few planes were in the sky also and could tell that this craft was at a further distance.   We continued to watch the craft for another 15 minutes as it moved up and down, side to side so very quickly.  I know it's not either a plane or helicopter because neither can move quickly from vertical to horizontal.   I am a female, 59 years old who lives in Texas where my husband sighted a UFO on our ranch in College Station about 7-8 years ago.  We own an oilfield service company.  My companion at the sighting today is my sister-in-law.  She's 61 years old and a psychologist.  The other person who witnessed this event is a friend who is 60 years old and teaches 5th grade in the local elementary school.;32.2514921052631;-80.8715543859649
