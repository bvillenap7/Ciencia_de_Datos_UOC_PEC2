Yellowish/orange lights hovering in the sky for about 10 minutes.;2014-07-04 21:30:00;10 minutes;Yellowish/orange lights hovering in the sky for about 10 minutes While in the driveway watching fireworks we observed 2 bright lights hovering high above the tree line.  They remained stationary and bright for a few minutes then seemed to go higher and disappear.   We then saw 5 just like that appear and remain in place for about 5 or 6 minutes and then as with the first two we saw disappeared one at a time.   Our neighbor told us the next day he also observed the same.   This is the second time we have seen these lights like this.;32.2514921052631;-80.8715543859649
A very bright green object streaked over me in the dark going NNW while I was our running-jogging.;2019-10-05 06:30:00;2 seconds;A very bright green object streaked over me in the dark going NNW while I was our running-jogging. While out running at 0630 hrs this Saturday morning.  It was dark.  Was looking up to West when a large bright green orb/fireball (?) object streaked across the sky going NNW. About 10 minutes later, as the sky brightened up, I looked up and saw a long thick contrail-like that completely crossed the sky where the object streaked over. Like horizon to horizon. About 5 minutes later I observed a military jet and its contrail flying parallel just to the right of the orb contrail.  The military jet was going very slowly as it was very high up.  Compared to the bright green orb like object that only took about 2 seconds to cross the sky over me.;32.2514921052631;-80.8715543859649
