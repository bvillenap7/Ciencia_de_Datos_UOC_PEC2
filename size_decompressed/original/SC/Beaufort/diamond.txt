Three silent objects seen in Beaufort, SC for nearly thirty minutes;2001-01-26 00:10:00;30 min;Three silent objects seen in Beaufort, SC for nearly thirty minutes I noticed what looked to be 3 sets of lights in the sky earlier around 7 pm. Since I live near a Marine Air Station, I thought nothing of it. I went out to my truck to get my keys at about midnight. On my way in I saw the three sets of lights again moving toward the coast in a stop and go pattern. They looked to be the same as earlier. What got my attention was that they were flying close enough that if they were Hornet's I would have heard them. Also the stop and go movement, the changing of formation, and the lights. What I mean is, I was stationed at MCAS Beaufort and I have never seen lights on an aircraft that flickered like these. I watched for about 30 minutes as they made there way over towards the the twon of Beaufort. They were so close that I could see the objects rotate and almost flip without breaking their formation. I just went outside and the dogs around the neighborhood are going nuts, but it is really quiet. They are just barking away. I know the air station has a few helicopters(CH-46's) and I know the sound they make. There was no sound but what ever they were stopped and accelerated with no noticeable noise. I called MCAS to enquire but was hung up on. I didn't know who else to contact.;32.4124060773481;-80.7030480662984
