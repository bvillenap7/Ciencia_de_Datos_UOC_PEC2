Three yellow orange spheres of light in triangle formation see over the ocean in the night sky at North Myrtle Beach.;2011-10-13 20:21:00;1 min;Three yellow orange spheres of light in triangle formation see over the ocean in the night sky at North Myrtle Beach. My boyfriend, a freelance writer and I a paralegal in the area, both in our thirties with no history of mental illnes or substance abuse, were walking on North Myrtle Beach when he saw two yellow/orange orbs hanging in the sky just as they dissappeared.   I missed this first sighting.  However, he insisted that it was exactly what a stranger in Garden City had told him about.  He thought that guy was crazy in the same way that I was wondering about him. Until suddenly as I was starring up at the sky they reappeared.  It was three yellow/orange spheres of light that appeared in a triangular formation lingered for about 20 seconds and then it looked like they got sucked right back into the sky and they were gone.  There was no movement other than the fade in and fade out of the lights.  We are going back out tomorrow night around the same time to see if they will be there again.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

Looked out our patio window and saw 3 different sets of lights in different formations above the Atlantic Ocean in North Myrtle Beach, SC.  They hovered for a while, disappeared, then reappeared in a different location.  Before disappearing, there was a line of red round lights in a straight row then they were all gone.  My husband had seen them there the night before also.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Flashing lights over ocean.;2012-09-10 22:00:00;20 minutes;Flashing lights over ocean. Many flashing lights about the size of stars.  One orange larger light lit up a few times.  Nothing any of us have ever seen and we have no explanation.  Endurance was about 20 minutes.  Lights sometimes went off in waves.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Orange ball of light seen over the ocean;2012-09-20 22:00:00;20 minutes;orange ball of light seen over the ocean My mother in law and i were sitting on the balcony at our ocean front condo.  All of a sudden a bright ball of light appeared in the sky over the ocean.  It lasted a few seconds and then disappeared.   As soon as the first disappeared another appeared about 200 yards away (the distance is a guess since it was so far away).  About 5 minutes went by and then we saw another bright light down the beach but this one was over the main land. T hat one was followed by about 10 more. All of these balls of light are bright orange in appearance.  The balls of light fizzled out after about 3-5 seconds each.  While sitting on the balcony filling out this form, it has just appeared 3 more times.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

Fiery looking object, no sound, moved slowly at first then more rapidly and disappeared in the clouds.;2013-09-13 21:45:00;1 minute (approx);Fiery looking object, no sound, moved slowly at first then more rapidly and disappeared in the clouds. This appeared to be a hot air balloon at first (but have never seen a hot air balloon at night)?  We thought it was a hot air balloon that was firing its burner? It was in the eastern sky out over the Atlantic.  We were on the balcony of our condo (17th floor). I also thought it was a plane coming in for a landing with an engine on fire? There definitely appeared to be a flame coming from this object.  I could not detect any shape.  There was no sound. I had binoculars on it but could not discern any shape, or smoke?  The object moved closer to  our condo, almost overhead, then moved back towards the ocean and was lost in the clouds?;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

The lights were staggered one in front of the other.....like two fighter jets would fly.   These lights were moving very rapid without sound.   When the lights went out of sight over the ocean not 2 min later I saw in the opposite direction still over the ocean three bright reddish lights with a yellowish effect.  This light seemed to be moving towards us but went out.  I feel that if it was moving that they would fade out but these went out like a light blub.   Later moving south one flash of the same color.  Nothing else was seen that night. I will be looking tonight though. Background: 37 year old male.  Christian.  Dad and husband.

3 orange lights over ocean Myrtle Beach, SC.;2019-04-17 22:15:00;5 minutes;3 orange lights over ocean Myrtle Beach SC April 17, 2019 about 10:15pm I walked from our hotel to the beach and began to observe 3 orange lights hovering over the ocean close to the shore, almost directly in front of me.  The lights would tend to turn on/off 1 at a time, were perfectly spaced out between each other and in a perfectly straight line.  The lights would fade when they went out.  I then noticed 1 orange light much further down the beach that was turning on and off at the same time the 3 orange lights were turning on and off - looked to be communicating with each other.  Saw this happen 3 different times with the lights going out for a minute or 2 before doing the on and off sequence again.  Saw the lights appear slightly further down the beach the 3rd time indicating it moved while the lights were out..  The last time I saw the lights they appeared much further out into the ocean far away from the beach which indicated to me it had left the area.  There were never any sounds coming from the lights, just hovering perfectly still.  Because this was against the black sky, it was hard to tell what was around the lights.  At one point, I felt I saw an outline of an object.  Here is a link to a video that another person posted from that evening - this is the UFO that I saw and I can say is a legit video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJd2j3IzzAs  My view of the object was much better than what is in this video, I was on the beach and in front of the object that was out just a bit over the ocean.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

I live in the Windy hill section of North Myrtle beach SC and while sitting on the oceanfront balcony we observed a large orange light which then became two lights, then three, and ultimately four orange colored lights in the sky over the water.  The lights stayed there for a count of about seven seconds then went away.  Pam and I immediately thought UFO.  While we were discussing what it wasnâ€™t, over the course of about 30 minutes it appeared three more times.  After the third time we observed what we thought were military aircraft searching the same area for a few minutes.  When the aircraft were no longer in the area the final observation of the orange lights appeared.  I am sending this information to NUFORCE so they can record the time and date of the incident.  I called Nufoce last night and the person I spok! e with said to fill out the form on the website.  My iPad is not allowing me to use the form so I am sending this email while the incident is fresh in my mind.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
