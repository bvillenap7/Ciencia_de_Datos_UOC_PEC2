Was completely silent, close, and very large My girlfriend, brother, and myself we on our last day/night of vacation in North Myrtle Beach, S.C.  It was nearly the off-season and was pretty empty at the pool/patio area where we were.  We were at a table talking on the patio that borders the beach.   IT was a clear night and you could see stars, airplanes way up in sky, etc.  I was facing the beach, my brother on the left of me facing my girlfriend who was seated on the right of me.   I saw two lights appear about 400 yards out over the ocean  (orange-ish in color) that looked like wingtip lights of a large airplane that would be flying directly at us.  However it was much too low to be an airplane and it wasn't moving.  I got the attention of the two others with me who watched.   A 3rd (center light) then appeared.  The object was silent and not moving.  Then the lights disappeared.  It was there for a total of about 5 seconds.  We watched the ocean, waiting for something to happen.   About 4 minutes later the object reappeared closer and a bit to the left now.  It was now at about 200 yards (close) and it was not moving at all.  It was completely silent and you could see 3 lights rotating to the left (clockwise).  It had more lights but you could only see 3 at a time as the object was rotating in place on it's axis.   We were all shocked and my girlfriend who is a complete skeptic just kept saying Oh my God, Oh my God.    It stayed in the same spot (silently hovering) for about 15 seconds and then the lights turned off all at once and it was gone.  It did not reappear.   I noticed about 5 guys gather on the beach after this occured who were pointing toward the ocean.  I believe they saw the object also but to my regret, I did not ask them about it.   Did anyone else see this?   I know airplane types, sounds, and statistics VERY well and this object was not an airplane, balloon, or normal aircraft of any kind.  It was very large (about 20 yards across), silent, and extremely stable.  It was almost like it was looking at the coastline from the ocean, then left.   Needless to say, my girlfriend is now a believer.    We unfortunatly did not have our camera on us so we are having a hard time convincing friends of what we saw.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
