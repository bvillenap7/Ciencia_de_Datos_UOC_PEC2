Strange lights over the beach, 2 dozen or more.;2013-12-19 19:00:00;10-15 minutes;Strange lights over the beach, 2 dozen or more. Sitting on the beach we first noticed 3 bright lights come on and then fade off.  After that there were flashing lights in the same area, at least 2 dozen or more.  Some were stationery and some would move in one direction and then another.  They were small, pinpoint flashes and lasted for about 10â€“12 minutes before just stopping.  My daughter described it as almost looking like fireflies.   A few minutes later we observed a red, reddish orange light about the size of the first 3 bright lights that faded out.  There were 3 of these and they were at different points in the sky, and appeared to be closer to water level.  My son and daughter had witnessed something similar in July but the red, reddish orange lights actually seemed to rise from the water and shoot into the sky.  There was a loud explosion right afterwards.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
