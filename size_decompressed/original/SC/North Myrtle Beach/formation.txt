It stopped just in front of us and up over the shoreline.  The star developed two more stars, one on each side of it.  Just seconds later those two developed a star on each side.   Thus appearing to be somewhat like a menorah.  They appeared for several seconds, then suddenly  shot upward disappearing into the night skies.  It was white/gold in color, and the stars were connected by streamers of white/gold.  They somewhat sparkled.  There was no sound during any of this siting.

Two instances of strange lights over the ocean, one right after the other.;2012-08-08 21:00:00;5 minutes;Two instances of strange lights over the ocean, one right after the other. This is actually two sightings, one after another, seen over the ocean from the beach at North Myrtle Beach.  The first was a bright orange light we initially assumed was a plane.  It then disappeared, and we assumed it just went behind a cloud.   A few seconds later, it reappeared, but had jumped a bit to the north.  Then, just south of it, a second light appeared, then a third.  Those three orange lights then faded in the order they appeared, and before they all faded, a fourth one appeared further south.  Then they all disappeared.  The next sighting a few minutes later appeared to be numerous, dimmer lights that seemed to shimmer around an ever-changing shape.  The shape seemed to go from circular, to triangular, to cigar-shaped.  It moved steadily south until it disappeared due to light pollution from the shore.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Possible Myrtle Beach sighting.;2014-05-27 22:04:00;15 seconds;Possible Myrtle Beach sighting. Just off the beach what appears to be 4-6 orange lights that appeared, disappeared, reappeared, and then disappeared one last time.

5-6 red-orange linear lights in the sky above the ocean. they appeared one after the other, and lasted 5 seconds each before fading out;2014-10-08 21:30:00;1 hour;5-6 red-orange linear lights in the sky above the ocean. they appeared one after the other, and lasted 5 seconds each before fading out We're on vacation. It was around 9:30pm when my friends frantically called me outside. (I am a lover of all things UFO, so they couldn’t believe they were seeing it and I was missing it.)  They saw 6 diamond shaped shadows with bright red-orange lights in the center. They lit up one after the other, all in a row, and each light lasted 5 seconds before fading out, one after the other.  They started almost directly in front of our condo 1-3 miles out from the shore and much higher in the sky than the advertisement planes that fly over in the daytime.  That first time two of my friends both got to see them through the binoculars and saw that the light in the middle seemed to change like an LED light- red, orange, green, yellow.  As the lights were going out, my boyfriend called me out, and I just barely missed it.  They said the diamonds appeared to be close enough they were touching and as soon as the light faded they disappeared completely.  We were discussing it- they were all very solemn, I was more excited/upset I missed it- and a little less than 10 minutes later it happened again.  It gave us all cold chills. There was something so ominous about it-maybe just because the unknown of it was terrifying.  I saw as 1 red-orange light lit up, a second, a third… there were 6 again, though they appeared to be in a slightly diagonal line from our perspective, but still lined up. I was not able to see the shape of the crafts.  They seemed to be farther and farther apart from one another which each sighting. There was also a group of folks who came from our condo out on the beach taking pictures. (Unfortunately the only clip we were able to record was as the last two lights were going out.)  After the lights went out and theories started circulating between us I told them to watch for military jets- as they are often seen trailing UFOs in many reports. Within 5 minutes a black jet with a blinking white light came soaring over the beach. There were at least 5 or 6 jets flying- circling over the beaches and out in the spots where we had seen the lights. This gave us some perspective on the size of these crafts, which  were very easy to see even that far out, whereas we had to strain to try and count the blinking lights from the jets.  We had given up seeing anymore, though we remained on the balcony, shaken, and maybe 15-20 minutes had passed, the jets had all vanished, and we saw them again, even further down the beach (toward Myrtle Beach, from North Myrtle Beach). This time I only remember seeing 5. Each time we saw them they lit up one at a time and disappeared 1 at a time.  This happened a few more times- At least 6, but maybe 7.  Though, by the last time or two there were only two red lights visible. There were about 10-15 minutes between sightings- more if the jets were circling. It seemed that intermittently between sightings there were more jets scrambling around. Its as if these crafts disappeared as the lights faded. Over all the event lasted about an hour and a half.  There were 4 of us outside after the first sighting (for which there were three) and my boyfriends mother saw it happen one time, making 5.  We tried our best debunking different possibilities. It wasn’t fireworks as it didn’t move. Mother tried to pass it of as kites or flares, but there was no smoke, no movement, just blinking lights of different colors.  And the three of them saw diamond shapes with their naked eyes. It certainly was unlike anything we had ever seen before and from my search, seems it is definitely NOT the first time something like this has been seen over Myrtle Beach.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

Multiple lights in m formation moving west from the coastline.;2020-08-27 04:00:00;1 minute;Multiple lights in m formation moving west from the coastline. At about 4:00 AM, I took my dogs outside to go pee. I live less than a mile from the North Myrtle Beach coastline.  Facing south, I saw 8-10 lights in a formation shaped like a 3 or sideways “m” heading west and disappearing behind trees.  The lights moved almost like a flock of geese and it was completely silent.  All of the lights were white.  My dogs started barking and one was behaving erratically after I saw the lights.  I saw something similar back in May.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
