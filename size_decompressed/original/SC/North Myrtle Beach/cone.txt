Gazing into a black sky over the Atlanta Ocean from our condominium balcony. 4 extremely bright lights flying in a rectangle formation with a light at the corner of each point of the rectangle.  Then, to our amazement each of the four lights turned into orange cone and appeared suspended.  The orange cone then turned into an orange circle with a perfectly round black core.  Then the orange and black circle seemed to fade until we could not see it.  After only a few minutes another group of 4 lights, same rectangle formation, same orange cone changing to a circle with black core.  We thought we heard thunder over the ocean, but the sound could have happened during the transformation of the lights to the cones.  The 4 observers were all over 40 college degreed professionals. ((NUFORC Note:  We have contacted the Myrtle Beach newspaper, in order to determine whether they knew what caused the lights, and they had never heard of them.  We will submit a letter to the editor, urging anyone who knows what they are to contact our Center.  PD));33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
