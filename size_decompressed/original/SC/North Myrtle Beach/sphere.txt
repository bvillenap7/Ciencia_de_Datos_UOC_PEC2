Two sightings, 3-5 bright lights in a diagonal formation and 3 bright orange spheres moving together illuminating and fading out.;2008-09-02 22:00:00;1 hour;Two sightings, 3-5 bright lights in a diagonal formation and 3 bright orange spheres moving together illuminating and fading out. On the evening of 09/02/2008 from approx. 22:00-23:10 a friend and I witnessed two very different sets of unexplained lights over the Atlantic ocean viewed from north Myrtle Beach, SC. The conditions were clear with out a cloud in the sky. The first set of lights seen were 3-5 varying bright white lights moving very fast horizontally, faster then any commercial or military jet I have ever seen, northerly in a diagonal formation. The lights suddenly stopped and remained still for 10 – 15 seconds and then moved vertically straight up into the sky, again very fast. They stopped once again and then proceeded to move horizontally to the south only to stop again and move diagonally downward to the north again. This movement repeated again and again and each time lasted about 5-10 minutes. The lights would be bright and fade and get bright again. At the end of the last sequence the lights got very bright, separated, and each went in different directions and were gone from sight. The second set of lights was 3 bright orange spheres and either all were lit at once or they would alternate illuminating in a sequence. These lights were moving in a horizontal direction toward the south. They would move extremely fast and then stand still illuminating and fading out either gradually or all at once. They continued toward the south appearing and disappearing 3-5 times and then immediately changed direction moving back to the north while still illuminating in the same manner. They reached the point we first saw them and again disappeared only to re-appear again much further south in a matter of less than a minute. This sighting continued for almost an hour and then stopped.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

The large spares disappeared within 10 seconds.  The star sized objects moved north with a random blinking and jumping around flow pattern until out of site for 2 minutes.   Ten minutes later 2 fight jets approached from the south and headed north circled back then east and back south again. 2 more jets approached from the north headed south then circle back north.   This is my 3rd sighting in three years of the yellow spares and star sized objects.   This  is my third sighting in four years.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

At our resort in N. Myrtle Beach Ocean Creek, while on balcony with ocean front view, very close to 21:00 we (my husband and I and our 2 sons) saw a bright amber/orange sphere glowing above the beach, it did not make a sound, no blinking lights just sat there still for 1-2 minutes, ran to get camera, but it then disappeared into thin air before it could take a picture or video, like someone turned off a light.   We have never seen anything like this before, it was just sitting in one spot not moving. It was not a flare, meteor, plane, helicopter, or military.   We have never seen anything like it.  It was a clear night with stars out.  We did not see any aircraft except glowing sphere in sky above beach.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

At approximately 9pm EDT, while observing a full moon over the ocean from my balcony, 3 orange-red lights materialized to the right of the moon, staying in place, as another materialized in the 7 o'clock position, and then another in the 9 o'clock position.   A second sighting occurred over the ocean within the hour, however, just before, I noticed 5-6 strobe-like lights high in the sky just before the 2nd sighting which made me believe it may be military exercises.  The strange thing about it is that every video I have seen of military flares, does not match what I witnessed.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

Three orange spheres over the Atlantic Ocean in North Myrtle Beach, SC.;2017-07-20 21:00:00;3 minutes;Three Orange Spheres over the Atlantic Ocean in North Myrtle Beach, SC. It was about 9pm on the beach in the Cresent Beach area.  I was sitting at the base of the dunes looking out over the ocean.  Suddenly, I saw an orange sphere appear, as I watched a second sphere appeared than a third.  They formed a triangle type shape.   Suddenly, the sphere on the left blinked out, than the sphere higher up blinked out, and finally the sphere to the right blinked out.   At the same time there was a large aircraft approaching from the south.  It was very high up and was very lit up.  There was one red light to the west side of the aircraft and bright white lights near the center of the aircraft.  I thought it was a airplane but it was so high up I could only see lights. Following at a much lower level was a plane that I could see very clearly.  It was not a jet plain.  It looked like a military aircraft.  One other thing.  As the large aircraft was approaching I looked back toward where the spheres were and saw a glint of orange light as if the spheres were still there only I just couldn't see them.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

Orange orbs appeared and hovered off coast before moving towards beach, then they abruptly accelerated and extinguished their light;2021-01-20 20:20:00;10 minutes;Orange orbs appeared and hovered off coast before moving towards beach, then they abruptly accelerated and extinguished their light I was on the balcony of my North Myrtle Beach SC oceanfront hotel room observing the constellation Orion in the northeastern sky when I saw 4 distinct orange orbs/spheres aligned within a haze/aura or opaque/cloudy background of a larger figure appear over the ocean. They eased through the sky and seemed to be approaching the beach when they quickly accelerated and darted to my left and their light was abruptly extinguished. A few minutes later, they abruptly appeared again over the ocean where they hovered then they seemed again to stream towards the beach before abruptly accelerating and turning and their light again was extinguished. Additionally, there was no sound emitted from the vehicle.  I spent ten years in the Navy working in the special intelligence and cryptology communities (Naval Security Group/NSA) and I also spent 3 years at sea on an aircraft carrier, so I am very familiar with military aircraft and Navy ships/vessels. On another note, a week earlier from the same balcony, I saw and captured a poor image of a submarine on the surface near the horizon with what appeared to be a sub-tender and fishing trawler equipped with antenna array.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
