Yellow balls staying stationery in linear formation, then disappearing.;2002-07-14 22:00:00;1 minute/3 times;Yellow balls staying stationery in linear formation, then disappearing. Two circular yellow lights appeared in northeastern sky over ocean.  They moved apart, then disappeared.  They were higher than the moon, which was orange and large.  They were bigger than stars.  A few minutes later, three round circles with a fourth circle above on the left side, glowed in a stationary position, then disappeared.   A short time after that, a group in two beside each other, two above that and three above that, all in linear positions, stayed stationery for a few moments, then disappeared.   All these events were witnessed by four adults.  We were on a deck looking at the sea.   Looked up on Google who to report to and called you and we were told to go online and report incident.  Wondering if anyone else saw this.   Very dominant and easy to see yet we don't know what it was.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Balls of light appearing in various sections of the sky over the ocean;2003-09-08 22:00:00;2-3 seconds;Balls of light appearing in various sections of the sky over the ocean I am not reporting a alien spacecraft, just an unusual light in the sky that I am hoping someone can explain. My wife and I and two friends have witnessed these orange to amber balls of light (similar to a flare) on four separate trips (April 2002, Sept.2002, April 2003 and Sept.2003) We observed them always on a clear night, usually about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon and having a range of motion. Sometimes stationary, sometimes moving in a horizontal path for a short duration. I am an ex-pilot and know aircraft movements, and aerial flare patterns, these lights were not aircraft related. Due to there frequency of occurance, I am thinking they are some type of atmospheric phenom., but noone has been able to explain them. The closest explanation I have come to is ball lightning, but they do not match the descriptions I've read. These balls of light suddenly appear(like a flare) but there is no upward or downward movement, always horizontal. I have no way of telling how far out to sea they are or their actual size, but has an amateur astronomer, they have the appearance of apx. 3 to 4 diameters of Mars (as seen on 09/08/03). I have read in this register several observations similar to ours. I would appreciate it if someone could satisfy my curiousity about these lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Every thing was a very bright gold color.;2004-12-21 21:00:00;5.min;Every thing was a very bright gold color. It was either December 21 or 22, 2004, around 9:00 PM.  I was lying on the sofa in my ocean front condo that faces east when I noticed what looked like a sattalite.  This one got my attention because it shined like gold and blinked on and off.   I went out on the balcony to get a better look.  The lights were out in the condo.  Looking east over the ocean, about midway between the clear night sky and the ocean was this satalite shapped thing that glowed a bright gold color. It blinked on and off a few times.  Then it went real dim, like it was powering down.   Then three (3) round shaped bright gold colored objects came out of the bottom.  One went to the left (north?) and one went to the right (south?) and the third one went what I think was downwards towards the ocean.  The object powered up to its bright gold.  Then everything disappeard.  Everything happened quickly.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
My family & I spotted strange objects in the sky in Myrtle Beach, SC, then found one in a photo we took there;2005-06-06 13:00:00;40 Seconds;My family & I spotted strange objects in the sky in Myrtle Beach, SC, then found one in a photo we took there My family from Bell County, Kentucky was vacationing in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. We were located on Crescent Beach.  We were all out on the beach at approx. 1:00 p.m. Facing away from the ocean were myself, my husband, and my father, chatting with my mother who was tanning on her beach towel.  I happened to look up into the sky above us and noticed a round, grey object moving at a steady, fairly rapid rate of speed.  This object was absolutely not an airplane of any kind and appeared to be very far away, far enough away in fact that when it reached clouds it appeared to move either behind or through them, appearing on the other side.  I got the attention of my father and husband in time to point and ask, What is that?! The three of us watched as this object moved across the sky (right to left) and disappeared behind a cloud, not exiting on the other side as it had before, just disappearing into thin air I suppose.  The same or following day (I can't remember which), I took a photo of the ocean and skyline. I don't recall the time the photo was taken, but there was no sound of any kind of aircraft at all.  I noticed nothing in the photo until I loaded it onto my computer from my digital camera and saw a round grey object hovering above the ocean in the right side of the photo.   There is nothing in the sky at all (even clouds) except this strange object. This is not any type of aircraft that myself or any member of my family could identify, therefore I can only imagine it may be a UFO. It is rather creepy.

Multiple glowing orange lights at North Myrtle Beach.;2012-09-13 22:00:00;15 minutes;Multiple glowing orange lights at North Myrtle Beach My family and I were on vacation.  My two sons, my 4 year old grandson and my self were walking on the beach about 10 pm that night.  The night was very clear and the stars were really bright that night.  As we were walking toward our resort a very bright orange glowing light appeared just above our heads.  We first thought it was perhaps fire works but quickly knew it was not due to it hovering over our heads.  It seemed to be about 500 feet above our heads.   We started walking very quickly to get back up the steps to the condo (due to having a small child with us)  before we could reach the steps 3 more orange globes appeared next to the first.  They continued to glow for about 60-90 seconds before disappearing.  They appeared to be about the size of a VW bug each.   I then got the baby up the steps to the resort area.  My sons stayed on the beach.  When we reached the top about 30 steps we then turned and looked back at the ocean, all of a sudden one orange globe appeared, then the 2nd, 3rd and finally the forth all at the same time.  It was really amazing.   My grandson sayed it looked like a fireball.   They remained glowing for about 30 seconds.   Thank you.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

Fast moving, low altitude orange orb;2013-09-26 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;Fast moving, low altitude orange orb Location: Windy Hill section of North Myrtle Beach, SC – Oceanfront Condo Object: Fast moving orange orb The time I listed in Part 1 approximate. From my third floor oceanfront balcony, I saw a strange object in the sky. My vantage point gave me good visual clues to judge the height and speed of the object. It had a round glowing orange shape with no lights that you normally see on a conventional aircraft. The size appeared to be smaller than the small aircraft that you see in the area that pull ads along the beach. The object followed the shoreline from the east (North Myrtle) and flew to my right (west) towards Myrtle Beach.  With the night being clear I was able to track it for at least 15 miles.  It traveled at a constant altitude until it got about 12-15 miles away (Myrtle Beach) and then appeared to ascend, disappearing into a light cloud cover/haze. As it passed in front on me, it was only about 100 feet or so off the ground and was no more than 1/2 mile or so from my position. I heard no sound. I had seen other aircraft/helicopters during the day flying higher altitudes and further away and had no problem hearin! g them. Based on the time it took to travel from my vantage point to the clearly visible lighted landmarks in Myrtle Beach, I estimate that the object was traveling between 400 and 600 miles per hour. This was no conventional aircraft.  Over the years, I’ve seen hundreds of those in the night sky (and dozens at the beach)and know what they look like.  My wife and daughter saw the object but only after it had passed our position, moving away from us towards Myrtle Beach. I am a retired IT manager. I have seen and reported one other sighting to MUFON back in May, 2009. The sighting was during the day and involved a pencil/cylindrical object in West Virginia where I live.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Large Orange Circles hovering and &quotdancing&quot in the sky - North Myrtle Beach;2013-09-26 21:30:00;3 minutes;Large Orange Circles hovering and &quotdancing&quot in the sky - North Myrtle Beach 4 of us were sitting on the balcony at a beach resort overlooking the ocean.  Then we saw a large orange ball of light far up in the sky above the water.  It hovered there for a few moments.  Then another one appeared beside the first.  The first one moved to the right quickly.  Then the second one followed.  They kept moving as if they were dancing.  first the one and then the other would catch up to it.  At times the orange light would go out and you couldn't see it anymore and then it would reappear.  After they disappeared altogether two of us saw 2 circles fly VERY close to the hotel above us.  They were large but had no lights and no sound at all.  The moon was out and we could just see these large black looking masses fly a little above our hotel. it was very strange because it seemed like whatever it was should have been very loud but we didn't hear a thing. Later we saw the orange lights out again this time going in the opposite direction over the wa! ter.  This was at the Cherry Grove pier.  Not sure if it's related but we did see a dead bird by the pool and an injured bird soon after.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Several sequenced sightings of strange lights in night sky.;2014-06-10 22:30:00;15 minutes;Several sequenced sightings of strange lights in night sky. While sitting on the North Grand Strand beach during a full moon outside our condo, viewing a totally clear sky at the time, 3 red-orange orbs appeared in a triangular pattern, 2 arranged horizontal from each other, and one directly vertical from right horizontal orb. The vertical orb just disappeared, and then the 2 horizontal orbs remained.  Third orb reappeared in different location, now directly vertical from left horizontal orb.  Then all three orbs vanished suddenly.  The entire event stayed visible for about 25 seconds. About 3 minutes later the 2 horizontally arranged orbs reappeared, flickered on and off back and forth then disappeared again.  Their location had changed more southernly in the sky. About 7-8 minutes later four red-orange orbs appeared in a square pattern, several flickered on and off, then all disappeared.  These were now further out in the sky above the ocean and appeared smaller because the distance had increased. Last sighting was about 5 minutes later with just 2 red-orange orbs appearing horizontal again then disappearing. All four sightings were very linear in arrangement and precise in the lights.  There were no tails of light as comets or flares produce.  The lights were a definite red-orange that simply turned on and off in a very distinct fashion.  Their location was definitely in the sky and not in the ocean or on any ocean bound vessel.  All were located left to the full moon and the red-orange color was vibrant.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Multiple Amber Lights Seen In North Myrtle Beach around 11 pm, Thursday, June 12th.;2014-06-12 22:45:00;10 seconds;Multiple Amber Lights Seen In North Myrtle Beach around 11 pm, Thursday, June 12th. I was looking out over the beach at night at a pub and saw a single amber (dark orangish yellow) light in the sky.  Within a few seconds the single light split into 2 more lights moving to the left of the initial light, creating 3 total in a horizontal line.  The light furthest left on the light then split 1 more time producing another light which moved in a diagonal position (about 45 degrees) below the line of lights.  All of this took place in about 5-10 seconds. Shortly after the 4 lights disappeared two objects with faint whitish blinking lights were flying through the sky.  They started out in line with each other with one above and one below, and proceeded to fly on a diagonal trajectory meeting, or coming very closing to each other and then vanishing.  I don't know if these were jets chasing the objects, or other forms of the UFOs above, but they moved faster than I have ever seen a main stream human made aircraft move. Following the above events a bout 15 minutes later, another single amber light quickly blinked in the sky, and was not seen again. There were 20+ people who witnessed it on the deck of the pub. The observer filing this report has studied UFOs for a number of years though has never seen one before. He works in academia in the safety field.

It made no sound the entire time and then it was just GONE, also with no sound. It was extremely large and about 1.5 to 2 miles out to see. It's hard to tell the scale of things over the vastness of the ocean, especially in the nighttime but it was at least several football fields wide, could have even been a mile wide.  All I can say is that it was ENORMOUS and awe-inspiring.  I have no idea what this thing was, but it was definitely not of this world. It was not jets in formation.  It was not something coming from out in space like a shooting star. I know that aliens exist and that they come here, but I never thought that I would see anything like this in my lifetime.

My boyfriend and I were on vacation, sitting on the balcony of our Sea Pointe Condominium in Cherry Grove, North Myrtle Beach.

The two groups of circles traveled upward in groups of three and some flickered as if they were on fire.  Their departure into the sky looked as if it was arranged or planned.  The circles traveled so high that they each disappeared one by one into the sky as they flew higher.  The second group of three flew into the sky and formed a triangle.  The circle at the top point of the triangle changed colors from white to red/orange.  They stayed in the shape of a triangle for about 1 or 2 seconds, then all at the same time, resumed flying upward and out of sight.
