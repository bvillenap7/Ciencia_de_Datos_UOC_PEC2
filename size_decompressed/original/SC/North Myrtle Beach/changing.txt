Strange orange and white lights or obs over the beach;2012-09-10 22:30:00;15-25 minutes;Strange orange and white lights or obs over the beach My mom, dad, brother, and I were all sitting on the balcony of our condo last night after dinner when we saw a diamond shaped formation of lights just over the ocean, not a quater of a mile from us..  They were all 4 orange and did not stay lit for more than 4-5 seconds.   After the initial orange lights faded we witnessed white flickering lights that moved across the sky on the coast from north to south.  They did not have a consistent flicker (on/off) nor did they stay in the same formation very long.   The 3-4 orange orbs were either within the formation of the smaller flickering lights or just outside of the main formation.  This lasted about 20 minutes in total and then just stopped.   Some stopped to the south and then we saw 4-5 other lights back to the north about 15 minutes later.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Red, White and Blue hovering flying object that changed shapes and orientation over a 30 minutes period over North Myrtle Beach, SC.;2013-07-05 22:30:00;30 minutes;Red, White and Blue hovering flying object that changed shapes and orientation over a 30 minutes period over North Myrtle Beach, SC. UFO Sighting - July 5, 2013 10:30 - 11:00 PM EST  Three witnesses were on a balcony in Kinston Plantation, North Myrtle Beach, SC.  One witness was gazing out over the ocean and saw a strange set of lights that were rotating in a horizontal circular motion very close to the condo.  She told the other two witnesses to come outside and see this UFO.   They both came right away and saw the same thing.   We ran to get our video camera.  By the time we got back to the balcony, the object had moved horizontally to the southeast of us away from the ocean.  We shot some still pictures and by the time we videoed, it was very small and far away.  However, we noticed there was another red light to the bottom left of the larger set of lights.  After a moment, the smaller light joined the larger set of lights. We looked up the UFO Hotline number and called immediately to discuss next steps.  We were told to give the direction we saw the UFO and describe it.  While we were speaking to them, the UFO moved back toward us Northeast out over the ocean behind our condo out of site for us.    We were then able to video the circular flashing lights that were red, blue and white.  At one point, it changed and took the shape of an angel with the white light coming down in the middle and the red lights on either side.   Sometimes the lights would be circular and rotate horizontally and sometimes they would be solid horizontal red lights.   At other times, the lights would just be blinking.  We were on the phone with the UFO hotline for 8 minutes reporting at starting at 10:42 PM EST.  We ruled out human aircrafts that we know of due to the wavy movement of the hovering of the object.   At one point, it was almost like it was standing still but it was making small fast smooth movements left and right and then left and right again.  After standing in roughly one spot for several minutes, the UFO was just hovering in one spot.  We were on the phone with UFO hotline the entire time after it came back in our view and recording video.  Just as a note in case you are wondering, there were no drugs or alcohol involved in this sighting.  It is 11:34 PM EST and we are now uploading the untouched video to YouTube for sharing with Director@UFOcenter.com.

Sparkle lights turn to bright red/orange orbs over North Myrtle Beach.;2014-08-20 22:45:00;10 seconds;Sparkle lights turn to bright red/orange orbs over North Myrtle Beach. Around 10:45 pm I was looking put across the ocean when I looked up and saw what appeared to be 4 or 5 airplanes flying at high altitude.  I thought they were planes because if the white blinking lights.   I was on the phone when I said to my husband,  I'm looking at like 5 airplanes in one spot.   At that exact moment the blinking lights stopped and three red/orange looking balls appeared in the sky for 5 or so seconds.   Then they vanished.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Many lights over North Myrtle Beach ocean moving erratically;2021-05-14 23:50:00;30+;Many lights over North Myrtle Beach ocean moving erratically Last night while watching comedy on Netflix, I observed an orange light flash outside my beachfront condo. When it did it again I got up and got my binoculars and my iPhone to take a picture.  I could see many lights out over the ocean but thru the binoculars I can see that some of them are moving very erratically and changing color equally as fast.  I took a picture and when you enlarge the photo you can see one of the lights is a red color and looks to have energy coming from it.  The ufos stayed there for more than 40 mins.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
