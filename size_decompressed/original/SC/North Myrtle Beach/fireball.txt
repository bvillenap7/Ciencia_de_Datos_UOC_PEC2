Twinkling lights in triangle formation form straight line and light up like large fireballs;2012-01-18 19:50:00;4 minutes;Twinkling lights in triangle formation form straight line and light up like large fireballs 3 objects in triangle formation looked like twinkling stars moving across sky.  Objects formed a straight line in sky and glowed bright orangery red like a ball of fire.  Size of glowing object much larger than any lights ever seen on plane.  Objects glowed for approximately 10 seconds, then disappeared.  Reappeared less than a minute later what must have been several miles away over where the ocean is and glowed orange, hovered for several seconds and then completely disappeared.   When objects disappeared no trail was left and no twinkling lights as seen previously were seen.  I have heard many reports from friends of these orange light sightings in our area but was completely skeptical until last night.  Might have questioned myself if I did not have 4 others with me who saw the same thing.  The other witnesses agree, this was not a plane.

Large fireball seen over North Myrtle beach.;2012-07-12 21:30:00;20 seconds;Large fireball seen over North Myrtle Beach. Large light of what appeared to be a plane.  However, once it was overhead, it was clearly a ball of fire. It's hard to describe the size of the object.  It was obviously large.  From ground perspective,  the fireball was ~ half a centimeter.  Obviously the object was much larger than that.  That's just how big it looked from my perspective.  The object traveled in a straight path. As the fireball passed overhead, I could hear the fire it omitted.  It sounded like a blow torch.  I couldn't hear it very well.  (I am deaf in one ear). However, the other witnesses said it was very loud. Once the object was abt 45 degrees above the horizon, it died out. It still traveled in a straight path. As it died out, the fireball left a thick trail of smoke. Then it faded out into the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous provides minimal contact information.

Reddish yellow orbs seen off the beach in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina;2012-08-07 22:35:00;30 seconds;Reddish yellow orbs seen off the beach in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina My wife and I were sitting on the balcony of our condo adjacent to the oceanfront. While looking out over the beach in a southeasterly direction, we noticed 3 distinct reddish-yellow &quotorbs&quot or fireballs in the sky.  These were in a distinct linear pattern with what appeared to be a few thousand feet of separation.  We thought they could be aircraft traveling in an approach pattern, however, there was no movement off these lights.  They simply appeared, remained stationary for a period of 30 seconds to 1 minute and then they disappeared.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
One large red fireball descending from sky, which broke into 7 others and proceeded to blink and move sparatically.;2013-06-20 22:10:00;1 minute;One large red fireball descending from sky, which broke into 7 others and proceeded to blink and move sparatically. My wife and I were sitting on a condo porch looking at the almost full moon, when both of us watched what looked like a single fireball or large red shooting star descend from the sky.   The object was staying in almost one p,ace the whole time, then appeared to break into two pieces, maybe three.  They were blinking and moving in one direction, but then back tracked and blinked in different patterns.  Then one fireball or light broke into about 5 pieces and travelled upward together, while two other lights appeared to mimicking each other, while blinking back and forth to each other.  They would stay close to each other throughout the whole duration, but the two that mimicked each other (away from the other five) would some times back track, as if to go in reverse quickly and sort of far away, then come right back to where they were.   We were not in toxicated and do not do drugs, but are school teachers who would not have believed anyone if they told us......! we have never seen anything like this and I'm sure we will never again.   Just wanted to share, thanks!;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Chinese lanterns with orange glow very popular in the Myrtle Beach area.;2014-01-01 23:00:00;1 hour;Chinese lanterns with orange glow very popular in the Myrtle Beach area. There have been a large number of sightings of orange fireballs floating in the sky in this area.  I visit this area several times a year and have noticed that the fad this year at the beach is launching Chinese lanterns.  I witnessed at least 10 of these large lanterns being launched on the beach in a short time.  They are available in many of the tourist gift shops and have been very popular in the past year. This could explain some of the sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

Orange duplicating lights over N. Myrtle Beach.;2014-06-25 22:30:00;15-20 minutes;Orange duplicating lights over N Myrtle Beach Over North Myrtle Beach around 10:30 at night on June 23, 2014 my wife, brother, and mother in law we're sitting on our balcony talking before bed and I saw an orange ball of light in the nearby sky.   This light quickly turned into 4 lights moving across the sky like an inch worm.  The second that one ball of orange light disappeared, another would develope about a centimeter away (from my perspective of the sky).  The lights the all distinguished.  This lasted about 10 seconds.  About another 30 seconds later it all happened again in a totally different area of the sky!  This time exposing 8 lights. After telling my other relatives of what had happened, another day went by and no lights were visible that night. Then came June 25, 2014.   Again, at 10:35pm, the lights happened again, only this time they appeared and reappeared in multiple areas of the sky at the same time, and duplicated into 7 different balls of light, moving in a southern linear direction.  On this night I was with 8 other people, who all saw these lights.   On both nights there also appeared to be odd lights right next to the orange duplicating balls of light.  These lights were small and quickly flickering all around the area of the UFOs.  These lights would change direction and appear and disappear effortlessly.  This lasted 15-20 minutes.  No sound was heard throughout experiences ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Orange ball of light, low over North Myrtle Beach May 6, 2015 during the late evening.;2015-05-06 21:30:00;20 seconds;Orange ball of light, low over North Myrtle Beach May 6, 2015 during the late evening We were visiting North Myrtle Beach the week of May 2-9, 2015.   Late on the evening on Weds., May 6, 2015, my husband and I saw a low flying orange streak of fire, just flying over the tops of hotels.  This happened close to Boulineau's in North Myrtle.  This lasted for about 20 seconds, and then the light vanished.  No noise, and no crash.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
*VIDEO* multiple orbs sighted between 9:30 & 10 p.m.;2018-05-21 21:30:00;seconds per sighting;*VIDEO* multiple orbs sighted between 9:30 & 10 p.m. (Video linked at the bottom of full sighting description)   We had multiple sightings this night.  Each sighting was the same reddish-orange color, with a duration of between two and ten seconds per sighting.  There were no booms or any other discernible sounds accompanying any of the sightings.  There was little movement observed – perhaps a slight drift but the lights seemed to be mostly stationary.  There were also no aircraft observed during the sightings, but several jets and helicopters were observed approximately 10-20 minutes after the last sighting. The first sighting was about 9:30 p.m.  My mom and I were on the hotel balcony and we witnessed several extremely bright “orbs” that lit up over the ocean for approximately two seconds.  They seemed to be fairly close to the shore.  I saw four, my mom saw three.  This was by far the brightest sighting of the orbs we had that night.  Unfortunately, I did not capture this sighting on video. The next two sightings occurred at 9:35 and 9:38.  I captured both of these on video.  Each of these two sightings were of what seemed to be a solitary orb ejecting another orb.  The original orb would fade out and the ejected orb would eject another orb before fading out.  These seemed to be much further out over the ocean – maybe as far out as a mile but difficult to say with certainty. At around 9:43 another appeared.  I was trying to mount my camera phone (iPhone 6s) to the tripod while filming and accidentally switched it from video mode to picture mode.  I ended up with several blurry pictures, but one that was somewhat clear.  I included this picture in the video.  I didn’t get a very good look at this orb as I was frantically trying to get my phone mounted. The last sighting was around 9:50 and it seemed to be very far out to sea.  It blinked out just before I had the chance to get any footage of it. My family has been vacationing at Myrtle Beach for years.  I had heard that this was a UFO hot spot and I had always hoped to see the strange light phenomenon the locals were talking about.  I never saw anything out of the ordinary in any of my previous vacations there.  I guess I just got lucky – because this time I did!
