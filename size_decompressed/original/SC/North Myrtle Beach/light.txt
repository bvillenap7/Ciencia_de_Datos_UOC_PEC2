The whole time this was going on we notices a light of to our right that appeared to be a very bright star. The light stayed in one place for 30 minutes which was out over the ocean also. I then got my video camera on it and started taping. Shortly after the object started to move. The camera was set on manual for focusing because the auto focus would not lock on to it. The picture does go out of focus at times. I'm not 100% sure it was not a helicopter, BUT it was very strange.

Peculiar lights in the sky;2005-09-15 21:30:00;45 minutes;Peculiar lights in the sky I was with my wife, her sister, my brother-in-law, and their three children.  We were in the condo where we were staying.  It was about 9:30 in the evening.  The condo is on the fifth floor, overlooking the ocean.  We just went out on the balcony for some air when we saw some peculiar lights out over the ocean.  There was no noise and all the lights were the same configuration. They didn't appear to move but seemed to stay in the same place and blink on and off.  The lights were arranged in a horizontal line in a set of three.  They weren't very bright.  The lights were an equadistance apart.  They did seem to be at verying distance from us as some of the crafts (sets of light) seemed to be farther away or at least the lights were closer together like they would appear if the crafts were farther away. The lights were all the same color - white and it was quite dark and there was a high cloud cover so there were no stars. The lights (crafts) were spread out all across the sky at varying distances. I thought it could have been some kind of reflection or a peculiar bending of light but I couldn't see how it could be so widespread and appear to be at varying depths. The lights did blink on and off at the same time and while I thought that was important, I couldn't figure out what I was seeing. It went on for probably 45 minutes and then gradually faded away. There is probably some reasonable explanation but I couldn't see what it could be so I thought I would report it.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

Over the Atlantic ocean there were 3 orange  round lights.  They seemed to hover with very little movement.   They were initially arranged in a triangle shape with the 3 lights being the points.  The light to the right and on top seemed to go to the right and circle around the other two.  This one light was moving at a fairly rapid speed.  Then as it one circled around to the left, it was as if all 3 sped out to sea or just disappeared.   We scanned the sky to see if they had relocated or could find them elsewhere, but did not see any more.

The lights were bright, yellowish, and looked very similar to the landing spotlight of a large airplane.  We would see anywhere from 1 to 5 at once, in various random positions, as if a formation of many random aircraft were turning spotlights on and off in no particular patterns or arrangments.  If I had to guess I'd say they were several miles out to sea, but looked as bright as the ones taking off from the Myrtle Beach airport which were much closer.  This went on for almost 1 1/2 hours.

It was about 23:15 on June 17, 2009, and we were sitting and watching the waves and looking at the stars.  All of a sudden, three bright lights appeared in the sky.  We didn't know what they were.  They started out in a triangle formation.  But after a few seconds, they all moved into a straight line.   The three lights stayed in a line for a few more seconds before disappearing.   A loud rumble of thunder followed (it was a clear night, and it was not storming).   The two who  saw the lights called the rest of our family out to the balcony, but they were too late.  All they heard was the loud rumble of thunder.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

More Reddish-Orange light activity in North Myrtle Beach, SC.;2012-10-05 20:35:00;8 minutes;More Reddish-Orange light activity in North Myrtle Beach, SC. Background  Since mid-July of 2012, there have been numerous and semi-regular sightings of unidentified “orange balls” of light in the North Myrtle Beach, SC area.  The sightings have been ongoing, as recently as within the past week.  In an effort to witness these anomalous events, the author went to the area in question to observe on October 5, 2012. Two witnesses observed two instances of some anomalous aereal objects, and hereby submit this report. The witnesses conducted a field observation between dusk (approximately 7:30pm) and 10:30pm.  Subsequent to the sightings the witnesses did not discuss what they saw in any detail, preferring to prevent contamination of their individual accounts. Weather/visibility conditions  Clear until 9:30pm, then scattered altocumulus at 10,000' until 10:15pm, then clear. Temperature 77 degrees, Barometric pressure 29.95 in/Hg, Winds South at 12kt. Average amount of haze and ground lights, restricted observation of stars to 4th magnitude. Sighting 1:  Time – 8:35pm Duration of sighting: ~30 seconds Distance from observer:  Unknown Elevation above MSL:  Unknown Heading arc of object:  ~8 to ~10 degrees Azimuth of object:  ~ 15 degrees above horizon constant  Witness 1 Narrative:  I was sitting in a chair on the beach facing east.  I was watching the sky to the south, and turned towards the north and saw a bright reddish-orange light in the sky, with a magnitude of approximately -4.   I alerted Witness 2 to the object, who also observed it.  It traveled from left to right at the same elevation, and after about 15 seconds faded to a small pinpoint of light, with a magnitude of approximately 0.  It traveled toward the right (northeast) and gradually faded away to invisible. I am well versed in astronomical, meteorological, and aviation disciplines, and while the course taken by the object first appeared to be that of a conventional aircraft, I have never seen a configuration of lights of the sort.  There were no strobes (red/white), nor wingtip lights (red/green), and the object simply disappeared. Sighting 2:  Time – 8:42pm Duration of sighting: ~60 seconds Distance from observer:  Unknown Elevation above MSL:  Unknown Heading arc of object:  ~15 to ~20 degrees Azimuth of object:  From  ~ 8 to ~12 degrees above horizon  Witness 1 Narrative:  Alerted to the activity reported in Sighting 1, I concentrated my subsequent observation on the same area.  Seven minutes after the first sighting, I observed a very bright reddish-orange light very low to the horizon, estimate about 8 degrees, low enough to be partially obscured by the roofs of the nearby beach houses.   I again alerted Witness 2 to the object, who also observed it.  The object was rising in elevation to a maximum of approximately 12 degrees above the horizon, in clear view.  It was traveling from right to left, and was observed for approximately one full minute, traversing approximately 20 degree range of heading, and exhibiting similar flight and behavioral characteristics:  very bright, in the order of magnitude of estimated -4 to -6 for the majority of the time of observance, then fading to a clear white pinpoint of light with an estimated magnitude of 0 or 1, and finally disappearing altogether.  While the course taken by the object first appeared to be! that of a conventional aircraft, the lighting presentation was unconventional.  There were no strobes (red/white), nor wingtip lights (red/green), and the object simply disappeared.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

I am a retired RN and have never believed in UFO sightings prior to this experience.  As I got up to get my husband, they disappeared.  I opened the balcony door and said, I just saw four UFOs.

We have seen these lights numerous times over the years. They seem to occur around the times of 8pm - 9pm over the ocean (not on the horizon, but a great distance into the sky). It will all begin with several orange orbs appearing, we've counted up to 5. The lights will go on and off in order while in a straight line. Once all light are off,  they often appear again in different areas across the sky glowing on and off with their orange light this time not in a line instead, scattered. After a short period of time the light show seems to come to an end and they will disappear into the night sky.

One large white orb and several orbs individually red, blue, and green over the ocean;2017-08-21 00:00:00;1 hour;One large white orb and several orbs individually red, blue, and green over the ocean The events occurred on the deck off porch of home on beach near cross streets North Ocean Blvd and 39th Ave N. around midnight for four nights in a row after the solar eclipse August 21st, 2017. Each event started with one light over the ocean moving about and up and down. We observed the lights with our naked eyes but used binoculars during the event. With the binoculars we could see they were orbs. The lights were individually white, red, blue, and green. The first orb was white. When it moved close to the surface of the ocean we could see light reflecting off the water. After about 15 to 20 mins. The single white orb moved up further above the water and seemed to emit three new smaller orbs that were individually red, blue, and green.  The new smaller colored orbs moved around and all around the larger white orb and moved at right angles at times as the moved away from the orb.  They seemed almost playful at times but more often looked as if they were looki! ng for something. They never left the orb.  \After about 20 mins. The three orbs disappeared slowly. Later Two orbs were again emitted from the larger white orb. One red and one green.  These two orbs wandered north and south of the larger white orb at much further distances that the other three orbs.  The orbs never came as far as the beach. They stayed well out to sea.  After more than and hour and a half the small orbs disappeared. Once the larger white orb was alone the larger white orb slowly when down into the ocean.  This repeated very similarly for four nights in a row.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

Large, bright orange lights, appearing and disappearing over the coast, accompanied by smaller white lights.;2020-06-25 21:45:00;30 minutes;Large, bright orange lights, appearing and disappearing over the coast, accompanied by smaller white lights. Beginning at 21:45, 3 observers (later growing to 9) were looking out to sea from a beachfront property at the extreme north end of the Cherry Grove Beach neighborhood in North Myrtle Beach, SC.  The sky was mostly clear with a thunderstorm offshore to the SE, 10 miles or so out.  Temp was 77 degrees F. At that time, three very bright orange lights appeared in the sky ENE over the water, approximately 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon.  They were much larger and brighter than the stars, and initially looked like military flares, but they didn't fall.  The lights stayed in place for 5-10 seconds before fading out. At that point, 6-8 tiny white lights appeared in their place.  They were much smaller and dimmer than the orange lights had been and they resembled conventional aircraft when viewed at night from a great distance.  However, they were blinking randomly, did not appear to use conventional navigation lights, and were moving erratically in different directions.  Three of them headed NE while the others moved SW. We observed them for around 4-5 minutes before they disappeared from view. Within about 10 minutes, the large, bright orange lights reappeared a little further down the beach toward the SW. Initially, one light would appear in place, lasting 5-10 seconds before fading out.  Then another would do the same a few minutes later.  They were not launched from the surface nor dropped from any aircraft. A few minutes later, a chain of three orange lights appeared, flaring up in succession, one after the other, in a straight line in tight formation.  This chain was perhaps 10 degrees above the horizon.  They then faded out in the same order they appeared. After this, two appeared and then disappeared in the same manner.  Then, a chain of four appeared and disappeared in the same manner.  All of these “light chains” appeared in a range that was 10-15 degrees above the horizon.  After the chain of four faded out, the tiny dim lights reappeared in their place and flew away in different directions, blinking randomly. We observed these lights for 3-5 minutes before they were no longer visible. At about 22:15, after no activity for a few minutes, the group of observers dispersed.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
