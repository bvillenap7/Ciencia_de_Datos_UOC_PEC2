Three orange/reddish triangular  lights over North Myrtle Beach!;2011-06-28 21:25:00;2 Minutes;Three orange/reddish triangular  lights over North Myrtle Beach! Every year we travel to Myrtle beach for a vacation and stay somewhere between 7-10 days.  This year we stayed at North Beach Plantation in North Myrtle and really had a good time.  On our second to last night there, my girlfriend and I grabbed two beach chairs and headed to the ocean around 9:10 to relax!    After about a 10-15 minute walk we arrived to the beach and were looking for a place to sit.  As we were walking south, with the Atlantic Ocean to our left, I looked at the sky and noticed three orange/reddish lights that resembled a perfect triangle.  I dropped the chairs and couldn't get the words out of my mouth fast enough to tell my girlfriend to look as she was beside me.  We both saw the lights hovering for about 1-1/2 minutes before it completely vanished.  We sat for about an hour after that and rolled out every single possibility from a plane, fireworks, ship, moon, local airport, stars, parachutes, etc.   We were not under the influence of any d! rugs or alcohol and had no explanation for what we saw.  I NEVER believed in any type of UFO's, aliens, whatever.. but after seeing what I saw, I'm a believer!  We left around 11pm and went back to the house and looked online to see if anyone posted anything like this on the internet in the area, and low and behold there was.  Someone else spotted the same thing a few months back.  I almost feel like I should have to justify myself and explain that I'm not seeing things or that I'm in perfect health and not delusional, but I know what I saw.   We are actually headed back to Myrtle for another vacation in a few weeks and are eager to see this again.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Strange hovering light and military jets s.c.;2012-08-26 03:00:00;2 hours;Strange hovering light and military jets s.c. Saw a bright light hovering off shore of myrtle beach, moved slightly while hovering...light seemed to turn in different directions then a few times I noticed fast flying black triangle shaped jets flying by it and doing aerial maneuvers over the ocean back and forth past the light...I assume military training exercise and the light was from a chopper or herrier jet...but who knows.

3 orange lights at Myrtle Beach, triangle shape;2012-09-10 10:30:00;20 minutes;3 orange lights at Myrtle Beach, triangle shape I was enjoying my first night at Myrtle Beach with mom.  I was having a convo on our balcony when something caught my attention. 3 very bright orange lighs were flashing at each other.  Then they starting going out.  I told my mom to turn her attention to the ocean night.  She saw the last one flash before it went out.  I then noticed the smaller white lifts strobing  betweeen the points. And another triangle appeared to my left ding the same. Almost like they were strobing to each other. Not at the same time.  The lights would strobe drone one point were the orange lights were to ge other or flag anywhere in between, then the triangle to the left moved away and slowly both lights died. Later as I called my boyfriend one lone orange flashing light reappeared then dissapprared.  We saw a plane about 30 mins later when still talking about it and not even close to what we'd seen earlier. Id saw 3 football field across each in size. I don't know what I saw but I want! to see it again!;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Three points of yellow orange light appeared moving horizontally following a loud boom then disappeared.;2013-07-17 22:30:00;30 seconds;Three points of yellow orange light appeared moving horizontally following a loud boom then disappeared. At 22:30 at night I walked out of my building and heard a loud boom and the sound of a plane overhead.  I looked up but saw no planes.   In a few seconds 3 points of yellow orange (fiery) lights appeared in a triangle shape.  It or they moved horizontally towards the ocean for about 30 seconds then just disappeared.   They showed up from thin air and vanished into thin air.   I could no longer hear the plane sound.   When I went back into my building my roommate said he had heard a weird loud boom as well but didn't look out the window.   Outside with me was a man who was about to get into his car.  He watched it too then turned, looked at me, shrugged, got into the car, then drove away.   I have heard a boom like that once before when a meteor crashed near my hometown in Pennsylvania.  I looked up hoping to catch a glimpse of a meteor but instead I saw something that I couldn't identify. While watching the sky a few minutes later my roommate and I saw an incredibly fast moving blinking white light moving in the same direction as the three points of light.  It moved far faster than the planes I usually see and didn't have the same lights as the planes.  Just the white blinking light.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

I live about 500 yds from the airport.   I only saw the lights, not much bigger than the stars.   It blacked out what was behind it.  The lights were white in color, only on the outside edge of the craft.  It was a perfect shaped triangle.  It flew from the ocean N/W toward land.  No sound.
