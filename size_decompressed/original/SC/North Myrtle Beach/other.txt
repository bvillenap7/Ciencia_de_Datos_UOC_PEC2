Red light appears, disappears and the reappears in a different spotfollowed by white/violet lights flashing like sparkles.;2014-06-10 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Red light appears, disappears, and the reappears in a different spot followed by white/violet lights flashing like sparkles. I have been a skywatcher and UFO researcher my entire life.  I know where most (wandering stars) planets are and a decent amount about where the constellations are.  Look… You know when you have seen one.  There is no question.  Something lets you know that this moment is different from everything else you have witnessed.   This is the second sighting I have witnessed in two years.  The first was two years ago (a white orb) between June 6-9, 2012, and just yesterday June 10th, 2014, at 23:00 hours approximately a year and a day later, which I find to be significant in itself. Mostly cloudless night, upper atmosphere clouds scarce.  Red light gradually appeared out of no where around 160 degrees SW.  Came into focus for 3-5 seconds then dimmed out the same way it came into focus.  Red light then reappeared at about 125 degrees SW a bit lower on the horizon and disappeared in the same fashion as before.  Then at about 33 degrees on the horizon and at about 135 degrees SW appeared several flashing white/violet lights the size of stars, but within our atmosphere, like sparkles flashing randomly but yet sequentially.  My friend and I both witnessed the event. My First Sighting:  The person I saw my first sighting with (different person from this most recent sighting) told me a story in 2010 about being brought up (abducted) and would not discuss it again when I confronted him on the subject at later dates.  I knew for about a year or so I was going to see one soon and was watching the sky intently.  Later that night I asked my friend if we should report it.  Him and his brother said the next time I can report it. I replied to them both by saying, I don't know,  I have been waiting my whole life to see one it's kind of a once and a lifetime experience.  My friend said no maybe in a couple of years and it became clear to me he knew this to be a future factual happening which it has now turned out to be.  There is more to this story a big piece.  I'm not going to write about it.  Too difficult.  Contact me.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
A multi craft event, military personal sorrounded the sky during the event.;2014-06-18 21:00:00;2 hours;A multi craft event, military personal sorrounded the sky during the event . Walking on to the beach, we saw what looked like flashes of light communicating with each other in a very complicated yet uniform manner, walking a few yards a red light began to move across the sky towards us, a local military aircraft was flying in the opposite direction and for some time it looked like the light and the military air craft were going to collide, the light turned out to be much higher then the military craft and the 2 objects continued their routes, while this was occurring there were firework shows occurring several miles away in both directions of our location.   The communicating lights gave way to a massive red colored craft with black sections between the lights which grew and vanished after about 10-15 seconds, the red light that looked like it was going to hit the aircraft hovered over the ocean and took an immediate 90° turn to sea and sped off, red lights began to appear on the seas horizon and hovered there for at least an hour before vanishing as a ship passed by.   Walking on the beach back to the location of where the red light went out to sea was a very bright light, brighter then any star in the sky which morphed into a different shape, a helicopter went behind it and the craft vanished as the helicopter turned it's spotlight on.  The communicating lights continued throughout the night.   This event began around 9:30 pm and went on past 11:30 pm on June 18, 2014 in north myrtle beach;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Various orange light patterns. Stationary in sky turning on and off at different times;2014-10-08 09:15:00;30 seconds;Various orange light patterns. Stationary in sky turning on and off at different times There were 3 lights (orangy) that came on and off in a straight line.  Then a singular light above and a singular light quite a bit below.  The did not move but went off all at the same time. This took place twice.  Once at 9:15 pm then again at 9:30 pm. This took place out over the ocean.  Too bright to be stars.  Clear Moon light night. Too stationary to be reflections off a plane.  Not airplane lights as they did not move and were erratic in nature.  Not helicopter lights as there was not similar pattern between the various light formations. Too far in the air to be ship lights.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154

Red orange silent machine follows along the beach north to south directly over us.;2017-08-23 22:00:00;20 minutes;Red orange silent machine follows along the beach north to south directly over us. The event occurred on the deck off porch of home on beach near cross streets North Ocean Blvd and 39th Ave N.  The sighting started with a small red orange orb in the sky north over the ocean beyond the Fishing Pier close to 60th Ave North.  The orb grew in size and it move parallel to the Pier back toward the beach. Once the orb was over the beach north of the pier and noticeably moving south toward us (Three People).  The orb became larger as it moved south down the beach towards us. It was quiet and moved smoothly alone the beach.  As it approached 44th avenue we could see it was not an orb.  We could now see that it was two orb shapes connected by a small triangular part.  It remained the same red orange color as it approached and passed over us. It never made any sound but was about 500 ft off the ground when it passed over us. As it passed you could see that the two orb shapes were more like engines on an airplane, but glowing red orange and it was one machine with a triangular shaped body in the middle. Once we could see it looked like a machine and quiet, we were in shock. Our minds were focused on figuring out what it was. We all three agreed as it approached to would a unidentified flying object. The shock peaked as it pass silently over us. We all three expressed shock. We watched! it move south down the beach for approximately a mile and then turn to move out over the ocean. We could see it until it was located out beyond the Cherry Grove Fishing Pier and very distant out at sea and finally disappeared. Two of us had see other unidentified objects (orbs only) directly out in the ocean beyond that same deck four nights in a row after the solar eclipse. I’ll make a separate report on those sightings since they were different events.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
Flashing and fire in the sky.;2020-06-17 10:00:00;5 minutes;Flashing and fire in the sky. Hello, tonight as I was on my porch smoking and talking to my mom, I looked up and saw flashing lights I thought were helicopters started as two. Everything seemed normal until one went backwards on a dime. there was no time spent turning it just went back and forth again. so told my mom maybe it was a drone started thinking about how far out the lights were and it would be impossible for it to be a drone that would be miles out over the ocean. as I was talking to my mom more and more started to show up they were just flashing back and forth between each other in a white light. as they started to disappear a red fire orb that normally shows up around here lit up and it all stopped. the red fire looking ord normally doesn't show up as just one orb but tonight it did. i have lived at the beach for 7 years and seen the red orbs before. tonight was just so different.;33.8335884615385;-78.6592653846154
