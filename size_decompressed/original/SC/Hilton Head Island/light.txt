At first white object passed by spinning with white lights on the side.  The white light then turned orange and was floating and gently moving in the sky having static motions (jumping) from side to side and kept moving in the same position for almost half an hour before it faded out.;32.1754786427145;-80.7549668662677
Circular bright white light moving erratically across the sky before fading into an orange light that moved much slower.;2018-08-04 21:00:00;25-30 minutes;Circular bright white light moving erratically across the sky before fading into an orange light that moved much slower. Bright, hazy white light, circular in shape, moving erratically across the sky and spinning in extremely fast circles for around 30 seconds before disappearing. Light reappears and changes colour from bright white to a hazy, orange.  It moves much slower, going up and down and left to right.  Proceeds to make some extremely fast, almost jolting, movements, to the right, before returning to its slower state.  This proceeds for around 25-30 minutes, before it fades away. The light object made no noise and was definitely much lower than a standard aircraft.  It was spotted through the trees. We observed one craft and were facing an easterly direction out towards the ocean, which was approximately 2 miles from our location. All witnesses to the event were in a good state of mind at the time of the sighting.;32.1754786427145;-80.7549668662677
