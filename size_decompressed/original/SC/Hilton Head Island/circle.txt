We saw two orange orbs in the sky over the ocean off Hilton Head Island directly behind the Crowne Plaza Resort.  My wife and I saw it together.  It was one orange circle, rather small in size, and then it seperated into two identical circles.  The two circles became one again and then faded from view without moving.
