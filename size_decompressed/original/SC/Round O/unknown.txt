Lights over Round O, SC.;2018-08-21 21:45:00;10 minutes;Lights over round o South Carolina. I was leaving for work I got to my truck and noticed 3 yellowish white lights in the distance. I thought it was three planes flying around each other well within 3 minutes the lights moved all the way to me and went from white to red.  They were moving in the same direction at the same speed.  Now I knew they weren’t planes because I didn’t see any blinking lights, and there was no noise as they flew.  Now three planes flying the same direction of each other you’re bound to hear some kinda noice from the engines.;32.9405;-80.5739
