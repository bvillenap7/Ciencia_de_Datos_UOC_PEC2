It was around 8:30pm Thursday night February 12,2009.  I was standing on my balcony looking up at the sky.  I was actually looking at Orion when an object much larger than a shooting star and moving slower than I had ever observed a shooting star streaked north to south across the sky.  Im outside a lot and live in a rule community with little light noise.  I have observed numerous shooting stars, comets, airplanes etc.  This was none of these things.  The object left a trail and moved three to four times faster than any high flying air craft I have ever seen.  It was white and somewhat translucent.;34.1911;-80.9758000000001
