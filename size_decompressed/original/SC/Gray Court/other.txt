Triangle and cigar shaped stealth aircraft at night in gray court.;2014-01-30 23:00:00;1 minute;Triangle and cigar shaped stealth aircraft at night in gray court. Lead craft was cigar shaped, black in color and had one red light on belly.  Trailing craft was triangle shaped, black in color and had one red light on belly with a white light inset in trailing edge (facing backwards)of each wing.  BOTH were silent and traveling N.N.E. at an altitude of approximately 500 feet.  NEITHER had forward landing lights or typical flashing marker lights.  NEITHER left ANY type of visible exhaust trail. Incident background was a very clear, cold and starry night sky.  My deduction on shape and color was made using this information. I do live under a flight line for G.S.P. however commercial flights aren't that low and have NEVER been that quiet even at the 1,500 feet minimum glide height.
