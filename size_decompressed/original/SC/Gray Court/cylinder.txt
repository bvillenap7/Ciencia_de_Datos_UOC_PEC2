silent low flying fuselage with no wings;2014-02-15 02:00:00;4 seconds;silent low flying fuselage with no wings i just heard of you guys while watching ufo lost evidence:a few years ago i stepped outside in late winter to star gaze a little, i was out there at least 10 minutes, so my eyes were acclimated to the night sky, even thought there are some street lights none were real close to me. out of my peripheral vision i notice something coming down from the sky to my right (sw) as im turning my head thinking thats a large bird, then thats not a bird, a street light was reflecting off the bottom, at this point it was above the street light by maybe 10 to 15 ft. it was moving NE at about 35-40mph, absolutely quite, it looked like a fuselage with no wings but did have a tail fin (for the lack of any better terminology) it had a blunt nose, i really couldnt tell a color but it was metallic reflecting some light on the bottom, in front of me at about 40 -50 ft high, it was about 20-25 ft long and maybe 4-5 ft high, i noticed an orange glow, just like an old vacuum tube in ! a tv, it started out with a glow then lit up completley and that is when i realized it looked like a cockpit on an old WWII plane, the light went out, all was black, and it turned slightly to the N as it went just over the tree tops. i thought it was really cool cause, it was powered, but made no noise. i think the reason i noticed such detail was because i was in an observant mood already and i closed my eyes and went over every little detail several times so i could remember it well;34.5963;-82.1109
