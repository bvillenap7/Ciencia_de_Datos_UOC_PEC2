Me and my Mother in-law saw the object moving east to west very fast.  Never saw anything move like that before.  No noise at all.  Took this shot with my Droid 2 cell phone.  Object moved rapidly for a few minutes then disappeared.   No clouds anywhere.  I ran into the house to get the video camera.  When I came out about 20 seconds later the object was still gone.  We scanned the sky and then I saw it way over on the western sky.  Close the sky line.  We were both amazed at how fast this object travelled.  The pic is un-edited right from my Droid 2 cell phone camera which is a 5 megapixel.;34.5963;-82.1109
