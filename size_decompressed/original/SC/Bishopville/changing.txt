Multi colored strobe array pulling away from a VERY bright white light.;2012-05-30 21:30:00;10 minutes;Multi colored strobe array pulling away from a VERY bright white light. I stepped out of my house to open a gate for my horses.  As I was walking toward the corral I looked up and noticed an array of what appeared to be white, blue, and red strobe lights. (much like a light bar on a police car) I have seen it before and reported it to this site.   As I was making my way back to the house, I continued to observe the strobes which began to move south to north at a slow rate of speed, and stopped after traveling a short distance.  As it began to move, it left behind a VERY bright white light which remained on for 3 to 5 seconds, it did not move but was extinguished, a slight after glow was visible for another 10 to 15 seconds.  The strobe array was still there when I went indoors. It reminded me of a truck at an intersection, driving past a motorcycle with its brights on.;34.2241;-80.275
