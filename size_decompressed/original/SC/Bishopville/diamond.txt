Strobe-like blue,white, green, and red lights east of SC, MP108 I-20.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sightings of stars or planets??  PD));2011-12-31 18:30:00;4 hrs;Strobe-like blue,white, green, and red lights east of SC, MP108 I-20. I am an over the road trucker, currently disabled, my wife is a home maker. I first noticed the lights about 3 weeks ago. They seem to linger in the same general vicinity nightly, east of my home at about 10 O'clock. They are readily visible on a clear night. The lights appear to be strobe-like, alternating blue, red, white and green in no fixed pattern. Tonight my wife noticed one of the objects was lower and nearer our location than previously, and urged me with conviction, to report the sightings. I estimate the nearest object to be rather large, and about 20 miles or less away, as I write this report. Originally both objects appeared to be near Florence SC roughly 40 miles away. We have viewed the objects with binoculars but that provides nominal improvement to the image. (wish we had a telescope);34.2241;-80.275
