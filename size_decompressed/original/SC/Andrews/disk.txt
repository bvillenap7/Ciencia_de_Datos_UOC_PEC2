Unexplained Object Seen From Back Porch.;2013-09-24 05:15:00;5 minutes;Unexplained Object Seen From Back Porch I took my dog outside for her to do her business and as always I like to look up at the stars.  I went to the north side of my house and looked up and I saw these lights that were pulsating, sort of like the phoenix lights, but rapidly.  I stood there in awe looking at this object and it just continued very slowly right above the tree tops.  It moved without any noise and I continued watching it for approximately five to six minutes.  I then heard what I thought may have been a semi idling down, but the object was no longer visible to me.  I kept looking in the direction, but the object was no longer there.;33.4594;-79.5646999999999
