The triangle was flying low, about 1500 feet in the sky and made no noise.  It did have some odd blinking lights at each point of the triangle.  I find this very odd considering I always hear a aircraft when flying over, especially at 1500 feet in the sky!    I saw this UFO for about 30 seconds until it flew out of sight.
