Multi-colored light seen to the west of Seabrook/Lobecco, SC.;2016-08-30 03:00:00;30 minutes+;Multi-colored light seen to the west of Seabrook/Lobecco, SC. At around 3am on August 30, 2016, I took my puppy out to go to the bathroom.  I noticed a strange light, about the size of a star, moving in unnatural directions.  I noticed several different colors emitting from the light.   I grabbed my camera from my truck, and set it up on a tripod and started filming.  When I zoom in on the light, occasionally you can see an outline of something, which at one point looked like the corner of a pyramid.  You also notice multiple colors emitting from the object (red-orange-green-blue). Also, when I was filming, the light did not move as much as before I started filming.  But still, in the video you can see that the light moves downwardly in a right to left direction. This took place to my west (Lobecco South Carolina).;32.5658;-80.7196
