The 2 objects moved from north to south at a high rate of speed (10 seconds from one horizon to the other).  They made a few sharp angled zig-zags unlike any conventional aircraft.  It was a clear night, and altitude seemed like commercial jet aircraft.  No sound. No lights.  Very pales grey luminescence (almost transparant).  Shape was angular (butterfly or chevron -- speed so great hard to tell shape precisely).;32.7833;-80.2269
