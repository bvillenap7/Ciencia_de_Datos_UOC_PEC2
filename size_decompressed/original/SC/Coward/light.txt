As they passed I counted 3 and maybe a 4th one. We're out in the country where it's quiet and there was no noise at all and they were too close together to be conventional aircraft. The person who came and got me to witness this is presently a law enforcement official. He had watched them for a minute or so before getting me so the total time that he had witnessed them and the time that I got a chance to see them was around 4-5 minutes. They were headed in a northeast direction and were basically in a straight line at that point as they got near the horizon and also seemed to go up and down in altitude. They were filmed with the squad camera for maybe less than a minute or so although I haven't seen the tape to check for quality yet.;33.9932;-79.7516
