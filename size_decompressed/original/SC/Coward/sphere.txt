Very bright orb following our car.;2014-03-27 06:40:00;10 minutes;Very bright orb following our car We saw a very bright orange orb in the distance.  As we drove closer, we noticed it was following the car.  We changed four streets, and it followed us the entire distance even at speeds of 60 mph.  We stopped the car on one of the country roads and rolled the car window down on the drivers side.  The light started to descend towards the car.  As we realized it was coming to the car, we started to drive again.  It followed us another half of a mile keeping pace.  As we slowed again, I saw white lights come out both sides of it and it sped up high in the sky.  It was gone very quickly.  We didn't hear any sound when the windows were down from the object.;33.9932;-79.7516
