As The Garage Door Completed Raised I Looked Up And Saw These Bright Yellowish Lights In The Sky.    At First I Thought It Was A Plane But Immediately Knew That It Was Strange.  The Lights Were Very Bright, Yellowish, Almost Like Very Large Headlights Very Close Together.   As I Watched The Bright Lights, Waiting For It To Move It Appeared To Be Hovering.  I Kept Saying To Myself “This Is Strange.”   I Also Saw Reddish Flashing Lights On The Side Or Rear Of The Bright Yellowish Lights.   I Am Still Thinking It Is A Plane.   I Then Dismissed It And Left For The Gym But As I Got On To The Main Road I Saw A Plane Flying Across The Sky And Said “Ok, I Know This Is Not What I Saw Earlier.”   Still Not Thinking Any More About It. Later That Evening I Saw An Article In The Local Newspaper About UFO Sightings In SC.  Then I Was Telling A Close Associate Of Mine About What I Saw And As I Was Describing What I Saw I Realize It Was A UFO And That Airplanes Do Not Have Large Bright Yellowish Headlights Like What I Saw That Morning.   Then I Became Excited And Frustrated Because I Had An Opportunity To Get A Picture Had I Been Awake Enough To Realize What I Was Looking At.;32.9917999999999;-80.1187

I exited the back door to my house to let my dog relieve himself, and noticed a strobe effect in the cloud in the general area of the intersection of Ladson and Lincolnville roads.  There appeared to be a circular shaped object with a light beam projecting from direct opposite ends of the craft through the clouds.  This circulating light pattern continued at least 10-20 minutes.   An hour later I decided to drive to that area to determine if the lights were coming from the ground, but the lights had stopped, and there was no equipment on the ground that could have projected upward.;32.9917999999999;-80.1187
