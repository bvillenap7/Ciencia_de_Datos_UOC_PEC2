A cluster of red lights in the sky in Ladson, SC.;2012-12-28 21:25:00;10 minutes;A cluster of red lights in the sky in Ladson SC. December 29, 2012  I was talking on the phone last night to a neighbor of mine around 9:20pm.  After a few minutes her son came into her house and said “mom come outside and look in the sky” she told me to come outside too so I did.   When I walked out onto my driveway and looked up I saw two lights up in the sky moving at a pretty steady pace, I knew immediately that they were not airplanes and they were unlike any aircraft I had ever seen, they were traveling pretty close together and all of a sudden there came a cluster of them.  They were like all in a line traveling the same direction.  They appeared to be coming from the southwest traveling north.  I thought that we were being attacked or something because they kind of looked like missels traveling through the sky.  All of a sudden they all disappeared in the same spot.  We don’t know if they went behind clouds or just disappeared.  I am 53 years old and I have never seen anything like this before.   We were all startled and after they were gone I went inside and called the news station and asked them if there had been any other reports and they said no at least not yet.  I also tried several times to call the air traffic control to see if they picked up anything on their radar but they never answered the phone.   My neighbors son also took pictures of the event with his cell phone and has them posted on Facebook.  When he enlarges the photos they look like a red slender fiery object. This is the first time I have ever reported anything like this and also the first time I have ever seen anything like this in my lifetime.  Needless to say we all had trouble sleeping last night. Thank you Resident of SC.;32.9917999999999;-80.1187
Very bright light hovering in sky;2013-02-06 19:00:00;2 minutes;very bright light hovering in sky Stepped outside the car to smoke. Happened to look up in the sky and noticed a very bright light high above me.  It just hoveres in place for about 30 seconds, there were no noises or any other kind of lights coming from it.  It started moving slowly away from me becoming more and more dimmer and smaller it moved away until i couldnt see it anymore.  It all lasted about three minutes;32.9917999999999;-80.1187
