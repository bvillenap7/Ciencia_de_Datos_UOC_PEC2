Fireball With Long Tail Witnessed by 3 Observers  in Chester, SC, at 1AM on June 29, 2015.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite re-entry.  PD));2015-06-29 01:15:00;20-30 seconds;Fireball With Long Tail Witnessed by 3 Observers  in Chester, SC at 1AM on June 29, 2015 At approximately 1:15-1:30 AM today (June 29, 2015) my wife, 12 year old daughter, and I were returning from vacation on a late night flight from the Charlotte, NC, Airport, going South on Highway 121 headed home to Saluda, SC.  We had just passed thru the town of Chester, SC and were about 6 miles south of Chester on Hwy 121. Suddenly, all 3 of us noticed a fireball in the sky with a magnificent long tail for at least 20-30 seconds in duration (until it was out of sight) that was traveling at what seemed to be the speed of an aircraft.  The object was traveling parallel to the ground with possibly a very slight descending projection although it did not appear to be in an emergency situation.  No erratic movements or speed changes like portrayed on UFO sightings were seen.  The object was heading in a northwestward direction.  The altitude although hard to estimate, seemed to be what one would expect from a helicopter flying at its maximum height capability, but again distances can fool you and I cannot verify.  I can state however, that the object was blocked for a few seconds from the tree line.  I was able to get out of the car to observe this phenomenon, but did not hear any noise whatsoever.  The speed was consistent, the path relatively straight.  My daughter did mention that at times she tho! ught she observed pieces following each other, she described much like a train.  My wife and I did not share this description, but she has far better eyes than either of us. Although I am not a meteorologist, this did not resemble a typical meteor burning up in the atmosphere, and it lacked the excessive speed and downward projection of a “falling star”.  It had a consistent path and offered little change in its course or speed. I told my boss about this incident and he related a website from TV Channel 12 in Augusta, Georgia with reportings of it being seen there at the same time as we witnessed this occurrence.  Augusta is about a 2 hour drive from where we saw the event.  Lastly, my wife just reported that witnesses in Charlotte saw the occurrence at 1:30-1:45 (a little later than us) and it is being reported as a Russian satellite.;34.7131;-81.2188999999999
