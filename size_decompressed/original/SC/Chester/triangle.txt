Bright lights, shaped triangular with colored lights around that change staying in the night sky.;2016-04-24 23:00:00;almost daybreak;Bright lights, shaped triangular with colored lights around that change staying in the night sky. These have been appearing since 4/6/16  Extremely bright light in center.  I have seen them every night.   On 4/6 I was up around 4AM, noticed light shaped like a jet pointed upwards in Western sky.  It has lights around it, blue, red, green that changed around perimeter.  It stayed stationary until 5:30AM just over tree line.  On 4/19 there was one that was in the Western sky that was stationary and began to move slowly due West it was around same time.  The light was so bright that you could see the reflection off of our lake.  I see them every night in sky in different directions, mostly East to West.  Sometimes they are grouped and other times not.  I have noticed them blinking before also.  They are much brighter than stars and I do not think they are satellites.  No sound, always clear skies.   I have called my son in another area to look and also a friend that lives 8 miles away.  My husband and I watch for them.  I tell him the buggers are in the sky!  Very freaky.
