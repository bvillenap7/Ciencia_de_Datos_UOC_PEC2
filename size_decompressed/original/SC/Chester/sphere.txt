Two orange orbs flying around for 6 hours;1998-10-01 07:00:00;6 hours;Two orange orbs flying around for 6 hours I was about 13 at the time messing around in the yard around 7 that evening.  It was getting dark when I saw through our trees a bright orange orb about as big as a car.  I stopped and watched it when another appeared kind of floating around.  I stood and watched them for what I thought was a minute at least and felt faint like I just woke up in the morning then they went away quick.  I went back up to the house to my parents freaking out asking where I had been.  I asked what do you mean I've been in the yard, it was 1 in the morning.  They looked everywhere for me.  I'm 35 now and only a few have I told this to.  To this day, I still have nightmares about this .;34.7131;-81.2188999999999
