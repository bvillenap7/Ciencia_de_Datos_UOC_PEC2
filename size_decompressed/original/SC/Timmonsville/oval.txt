UFO at treetop level on woods;2003-07-02 20:00:00;5 to 10 minutes;UFO at treetop level on woods I live in a very rural town called Timmonsville, South Carolina. The population is about 3,000. I have acres of land in Timmonsville and trees are everywhere to be seen.  On one particular evening, as I drove my old car to the driveway, I observed a series of light just above tree level or some 50-100 feet in the air. It was suspended. I observed also, the shape of an oval object as large as my car which is quite big.  I got out of my car and stared up at it. It was motionless, with no sound to be heard. It must have been about 8:30ishPm. I live in a trailer with no houses around me for quite a distance. As I've stated, I own land out here and only occassionally do I hear a car pass by this desolate area. Certainly no aeroplanes or helicopters frequent this area...Please note that I was 79 years old at the time of this observation. I am now 82 years old and have confided this account only to my son-in-law to be. I prayed on it and was not afraid of it. I merely walked inside the trailer and closed the door and locked it securely.  I saw one object and one object only. The only possible background were the trees on my land, some are short and some are quite tall. But this object was plainly visible to me. I am certain that it was not a conventional aircraft as it stayed in the one spot with pulsating lights along the perimeter. That is all I can say.
