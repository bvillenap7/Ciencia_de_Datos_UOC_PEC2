Cluster of flashing white and yellow objects over Timmonsville;2008-10-19 19:30:00;15 min;Cluster of flashing white and yellow objects over Timmonsville A cluster of bright white and yellow flashing, sometimes disappearing altogether. Were hovering for the most part and sometimes drifting around the same general area. There were a couple of straglers on the outside of the cluster. couldn't see what size or shape the crafts were because it was very dark out. My girlfriend had seen the same thing previously about 2 years ago maybe about 4 miles from where we saw them tonight.;34.1023;-79.9393
