LOng cloud like object races across the sky;2003-12-03 17:30:00;4 min;LOng cloud like object races across the sky While my wife and I were outside sitting by a fire cooking hot dogs we looked up at the stars and saw a long very very high going from horizion to horizion, What I am going to describe is hard but i will try anyway. It was like a long narrow cloud, except it moved from west to east at an amazing speed and never seemed to get wider or more narrow. We both said boy look at it race across the sky. We watched it till it went out of sight to the east. We went back to cooking our hot dogs and looked up about 5 min later and watched another long narrow cloud like thing again race across the sky from west to east. This also reached from horizion to horizion. Like the other it RACED across the sky no way was the wind blowing this that fast. Even if you watched a jet fly that would be slow compared to how fast this cloud moved. We never heard a sound and it was a very quiet night. The moon really light it up. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed military fighter aircraft passing overhead at velocities higher than what is typical for a transport jet aircraft.  Just a guess.  We have received no other reports, yet.  PD));34.1023;-79.9393
