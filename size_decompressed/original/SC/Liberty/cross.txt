It's a bird!  It's a plane!  It's a what?!;2013-07-12 21:10:00;1 minute;It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a what?! Driving to Easley, SC, on 123 my boyfriend noticed a shimmering object in the sky.  He asked if it was a satellite or plane.  Me being an enthusiast of astronomy and air craft I could not tell.   As we drove closer the object in the sky got bigger so we guessed it was a plane until we got under it and saw it was hovering.  The craft was shaped like a bird but had a shimmering underside.   We immediately tried to think of any Air Force or other military bases around and could think of none.  We looked at each other and tried to look up the shape on our phones thinking it could be a weather ballon or other object as such.  Nothing came up.   Pretty thrilling experience to end the day with. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.7846;-82.6942
