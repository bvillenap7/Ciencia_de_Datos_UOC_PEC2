Possible u.f.o. sighting in Liberty, SC.;2014-05-06 23:00:00;1 hour;possible u.f.o. sighting in liberty s.c. As l was walking in  from the outside something told me to look up toward the sky so I did.  That's when I observed these unusual shapes in the sky.  I hollered for everyone to come see what I was looking at.  The lights were changing from white to red, to green and then back to white.   I grabbed my wife's tablet and started taking pictures of what appeared to be u.f.o's.  I know that these were not stars we was looking at because I tried to get a picture of some stars but this tablet could not pick them up.;34.7846;-82.6942
