As it got closer to us the size of the object became noticeably larger. It was a like a large light moving in the sky. The object came to an a brupt stop and we watched it for what seemed like three or four minutes. The object then moved at a super speed forming the shape of a triange in the sky. It repeated this move three times, sat still for a moment and then shot across the sky making a white streak across the sky. No aircraft we have can move in a manner as to stop and go from point A to B and to C making a triangle shape in the sky. A military jet came over towards where the object was after it left, followed by a helicopter. The object was gone by this time.

Extremely bright UFO staionary then spirals away out of sight.;2007-08-20 22:30:00;10 Minutes;Extremely bright UFO staionary then spirals away out of sight. This is the second UFO sighting Ihave experienced. I was looking in the sky as I normally do when I step out at night since my previous sighting in 2004. I observed an extremely bright light from slightly to the west of the constellation Big Dipper (Ursa Major). It was about centered between Megrez and Phad, the two stars on the side of the Dipper near the handle and slightly out of line with them to the west. There was no star or planet there the night before and the sky was clear. I thought it looked too bright and too twinkly. I thought it may be an airplane with its landing lights on but as I stared at it it did not move. It did appear twinkle a lot more than any of the other stars. I moved back and forth west to east and back a 100ft or so,  to try and get a feeling of how close it was. It did not appear to change its position relative to the nearby stars. It must have been very high up, possibly not even in the atmosphere. Just as I was about to say Hmm and go inside, it changed from its bright white twinkly color to yellow and through to red and made a clockwise spiral that decreased in radius as it moved toward the SSW (toward the star Mizar in the middle of the handle). The movement was so rapid it appeared to leave a trail to my eyes. The yellow to red color got dimmer as it spiraled off to the southwest. It disappeared in only a second after it moved, so the spiral was visible for a short time, but it was not very long.;34.3788999999999;-80.0830999999999
Meteorite object appears after what I thought an aircraft dissappeared.;2009-01-01 20:53:00;20-30 seconds;Meteorite object appears after what I thought an aircraft dissappeared. 8:53 PM 1/1/2009 exact time- observer location on ground approx 34deg.-38min.N, 080deg.-52min.W (Hartsville, SC) duration 20-30 secs In NW sky about 45deg up from horizon: Appearing to be high in altitude, I saw a few short irregular flashes of what looked like a small moving object. It appeared in the one spot, I do not think I just found it as it was moving. It was moving from North to South nearly directly. I would guess it could have been 10 to 20 miles from me. Its speed was like that of a high flying jet. I was not sure but I thought it looked as if it was slowing down! It looked like it may be an airplane very high up, but it quit flashing after about (4)four flashes (dull-bright-dull-dull flashes), and then I could not see it. About 3 seconds or so after I could not see it any longer, an object that acted like a meteorite shot to the NE from the same spot the flashes quit. The meteorite object was very brushy in its halo and tail, as if a lot of material was burning up very quickly, but it was not very bright. It had a reddish center with a yellowish corona and was very wide,also the tail was very long. The trajectory lasted about 3 seconds and had a pronounced arc as if it was slowing quickly. I estimate it traveled about 30 degrees in arc from the point it appeared before it disappeared.;34.3788999999999;-80.0830999999999
Very high altitude object makes sharp 90 degree left turn then disappears;2009-01-05 18:50:00;12 minutes;Very high altitude object makes sharp 90 degree left turn then disappears At 6:50pm on 01-05-09 in eastern sky over SC, I saw a dim steadily lit object traveling from N to S at a steady rate, not extremely fast, but sort of fast for the apparent altitude it appeared to be at. I estimated the altitude to be around 50,000ft. or more.  It was about 45 degrees up from the horizon.  It's brightness was that of an average star just visible to the naked eye.  It was nearly directly East when I saw it.  It traversed N to S only 5 or so degrees in 10 seconds.   I start thinking to myself here is another one!  So,I am thinking, I wonder if they know I see them?  So I say outloud: Do something, change speed, change direction, do something and I'll be danged if it didn't slow down to a crawl, then makes a perfectly short sharp 90 degree radiused turn to the E at its original speed and I watch it for about 5 seconds more before I can no longer make it out.   The sky overhead is overcast, but not in the East at that time. Then, 12 minutes later at 7:02pm what sounds like a flight of two to three F-15's comes flying overhead from the NE to the SW, on what could have been an intersecting path with the 'UFO' at some point. The flight sounded like it was approx. 15,000ft or less when it went overhead.  That flight was probably on landing approach to Shaw AFB as it only about 30 miles from where I was.;34.3788999999999;-80.0830999999999
