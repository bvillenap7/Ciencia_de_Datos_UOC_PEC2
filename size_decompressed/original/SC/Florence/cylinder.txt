I looked up to see where it was and saw a silver cylinder very shinney. I thought this must be the jet I heard but the sound of the jet was off to my left as I was facing about north. I tried to change my angle of view to see if I could detect wings but could not see any. The sky was clear blue with no clouds. The craft was directly over head moving very slowly toward the north north west. It wasn't making any sound. I watched it untill it went out of sight. I was in the Navy in navigation on a nuc sub and I am a private pilot. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474
