I just wanted you all to know that I witnessed it myself here in Florence while driving home from work.  I thought at first it was a meteor but it moved quickly from west to east and was 100 times bigger than any meteor I have ever seen.  It was absolutely amazing and when I heard your report I got chills! It was an enormous white fireball moving west to east at a low altitude unlike a typical meteor. ((NUFORC Note:  We are intrigued by the report.  The large meteor over South Carolina and Georgia occurred on 09NO99, and was seen traveling from east to west.));34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474
((HOAX??))  Two fireballs just looking at me.;2011-05-19 12:30:00;20 Seconds;Two fireballs just looking at me I walked outside during lunch at school to get some fresh air and i looked up and saw 2 fireball shaped objects flying in the air... I stared at them for a couple of seconds and stood in awe.  I ran inside to get my buddy and show him but when we came out they were gone.  They were two fireball looking things that looked kinda like eyes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474
