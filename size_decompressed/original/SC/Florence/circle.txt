Five bright orange orbs move across the Florence SC Sky;2006-02-15 21:30:00;1 min. 30 secs.;Five bright orange orbs move across the Florence SC Sky On a cool winter night in Feburary  I was standing on my porch looking across our apartment complex.   It was a clear night with out wind, and at the point I was out there it was also very quiet.  Our apartment complex consist of 7 builings that form a circle.  In the middle of them is a little park next to a little building that is the offices and the pool.   There also is the parking which is significant because the parking areas a lit with orange parking lamps.  As I was looking around this large open area I noticed another light that was the same color as the parking lamps except it was hovering over the building across from me.  The distance from my building to that one is about 200 feet.  After it had registered in my brain that a light shouldn't be there another orange circle apeared next to this one.  They were stationary and silent.  From my view point the UFOs were just above the three story building.  At this point I yelled for my girl friend to come out side and bring my camera.  As she was coming outside three more UFOs appeared below the original two.  After a couple of seconds the bottom three dissappeared.  Then one of the remaining two vanished.  When they would dissappear they would vanish like a light bulb being turned of slowly with a dimmer switch.  Now only one remained.  A couple of seconds later it vanished, but reappeared only now it was in a different spot.  It moved a little more east than it original position.  It repeated this action two more times.  Than it vanished for good.   Both myself and my girlfriend witnessed this.   However, it was very short.   My digital camera didn't have enough time to turn on.  I have never seen anything like this.  Like I mentioned above it was very quiet outside so that rules out any conventional aircraft.  These lights were solid and did not have any trails behind them.   They were very solid and smooth.  They were very bright, but did not emit any hue in to the night sky.   Since then we have seen them again, but in another area of Florence.;34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474

Looked up to view the stars.  Noticed something that looked like a dimly lit star moving southeast at a fairly fast pace.  It was white and did not blink or make a sound.    I would have thought it was a jet.  However, it moved faster than what a normal jet would travel. Also, there were no blinking or colored lights. If it moved any faster, I might have thought it was meteor.;34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474

Light turned red after staring out loud “well it can’t be a plane because there are no red or flashing lights” then the craft quickly went high in the sky flashed and disappeared before our eyes.  The sky was clear, no clouds.;34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474
