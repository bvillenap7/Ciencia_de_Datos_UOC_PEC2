We a UFO crashed very close to were we live.;2001-06-11 13:00:00;10 min.;We a UFO crashed very close to were we live. I can't exactly remember what time it was, but I think it was 2001 around the time specifide. Me, my Dad and my brother were going to the dump to take out the garbage. We started driving down our rode and went around a curve. Once we reached the end of the curve we saw this metalic looking UFO hovering right over the trees. We kept driving and the UFO went behind the trees for probaly 3 to 5 seconds before we saw it again and it had moved way up into the sky. We were all shocked because it moved to fast. But it wasn't far away so we couldn't see it anymore it was still pretty close to us. Then we kept driving down the rode and came to an area by our house that is a open field with no trees were the UFO was. We could see it clear as day. Across from the field are trees and as we drove the UFO started to hover down right above the trees over by were I used to go go school. Then it disapeared behind the trees. Then the next right were we saw the UFO hovering right across from the school in an area that there are lots of little pine trees there was a big clearing back in the woods and there were army trucks and 18 wheelers out by the rode. They weren't there the day before we saw the UFO. So when we saw this we thought immediately that the UFO must have crashed back there in the trees. After this the next day there were still some trucks back there but they had cleared out pretty much out of the area. Now there is still an open area where we think the UFO crashed. Now there is just a no trespassing sign up where a path leeds to the open area. This is my incounter with a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Two nearly invisible crafts spotted in Florence, South Carolina, before massive power outage.;2013-02-26 18:00:00;1 minute;Two nearly invisible crafts spotted in Florence, South Carolina, before massive power outage In the evening of February 26th 2013 two objects where seen and photographed hovering over the Walmart Supercenter parking lot on Beltline Drive in Florence.  They were almost impossible to see with the naked eye but showed bright and clear in the photos taken by a member of the store's management team.   They appeared near the end of a severe thunderstorm.  They were there for approximately one minute or so before vanishing.  Their disappearance only documented by their absence in the last picture that was taken because, as was previously stated, they were almost entirely invisible to the naked eye.  In the photos you can very clearly see a row of lights possibly and energy source along the bottom of the craft and one single light at the upper most point of the top of the craft.  I say light in quotes only because I assume if it were an actual light them people would have been able to see its luminescence with their own eyes wit! hout having to use a camera to see it.  So it may have just appeared as lights in the photos and not actually been lights.   Immediately after their disappearance the entire area suffered a huge power outage which knocked the power out for nearly 14,000 surrounding residents and businesses (Walmart being one of them).  The power outage was even reported on and was so odd and massive that it was written about online so you can look it up.   This is no joke.  Those involved are afraid to say anything because we don't want anyone to think we're insane.;34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474

Disk shaped UFO Ten feet off the road in front of me.  In midday.  2 witnesses;2017-03-15 16:30:00;3 min;Disk shaped UFO Ten feet off the road in front of me.  In midday. 2 witnesses While traveling down Old River Rd, away from Florence, a truck driver traveling ahead of me suddenly slammed on brakes and moved towards the side of the road.  This movement was caused by a saucer shaped object hovering ten feet off the roads surface.  The object slowly gained altitude while moving to the right.   We (the truck driver and I) watched this object move until it was level with the trees and suddenly appeared to go behind the tree line.  This was directly in front of a large building, that is open, but no one ever sees workers or trucks.  I drove this road daily, twice a day.  The vessel was around 10-15 feet in diameter, it was completely solid with no apparent openings or windows.  However, coming from the right of the center a L shaped thing was coming out of the vessel.;34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474

It kept moving through the sky to our right then continued on over neighbor's house and upwards and then I came inside to ponder what we saw.  not sure if it was a drone a big black ballon or what.  just wanted to share in case someone saw this and didn’t think they were the only one and maybe someone could help me understand what we saw.  now I am creeping out beacause I have no idea what it was.  did anyone else see this?  It was around 6-7:30 I saw.  Sorry not exactly sure about exact time but around those hours.  it was evening before dark on September 24, 2018.  Wish I had recorded it and got a exact time down.  No lights or anything just black.;34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474
