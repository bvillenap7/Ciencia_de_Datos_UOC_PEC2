As it came closer we noticed that there was no sound and was traveling extreamly slow, est. 5 mph. came within 200 yards of our position. At that time the sky became full of military planes and 2 chase jets. 1 jet came within a few hundred yards of the craft at which time it rose to 500 feet and literally vanished in a light trail.

I did not see it with my own eyes. Two rows of lights (6 each row) hovered close to ground, ascended above tree, returned descending, and jumped over fence close to where it started. It appeared to be between 1 to 3 feet long.  It appears to be transparent.  Only the rows of lights visible. No sound at all.;34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474
