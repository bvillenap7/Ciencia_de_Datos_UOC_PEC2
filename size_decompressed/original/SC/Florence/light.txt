3 Lights Appear in Sky over Florence;2006-12-13 20:30:00;45 Seconds;3 Lights Appear in Sky over Florence I was driving home from work and as I rounded a curve I noticed a light above the tree line that had a slightly orange hue to it.  At first I thought it was an airplane turning for approach as the light didnt appear to be moving.  As I continued to watch, suddenly another light of the same color/brightness appeared to move out from inside the first light and slightly down and to the left.  A second later an additional light appeared and moved down and to the right making a distinct triangular shape. There was still no apparent movement of the objects through the sky. (by this time I had slowed my vehicle into the median to watch) After sitting in the sky for about 5 seconds in this formation, all three lights faded out together just like a light bulb being turned off.  I frequently observe meteors from time to time at night and these lights displayed characteristics that were unlike any of the many meteors I have ever witnessed.

Lights in the sky;2013-05-18 10:30:00;30+;Lights in the sky My husband , our friend, an I were sitting on our front porch. It was a heavy overcast.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks when I saw all of these flashing lights in sky.  The overcast was very heavy so I knew it was not stars. Plus, the lights were moving very fast in multiple directions.  I told my husband and friend, and we all walked to the rode to see it.  They were very faint, but the little lights would zip across the sky.  As we watched three jets flew over followed by 2 helecoptors.  We called my neighbor to come witness it.  They saw the exact same thing. As of right this minute, they are still bouncing around.  They were on both sides of the sky in our viewing area.  Sometimes, the lights would be a little brighter and then quickly zoom off in another direction.  I cannot tell you exactly how many there were, but it was a lot and because they were in various areas it could have been the same crafts.;34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474
