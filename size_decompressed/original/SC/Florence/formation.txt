Around 5pm I noticed from my yard five bright circular lights.  They were in a formation like an arrow.  Three made a triangle and two directly following the triangle.  They moved back and forth slightly.   They remained in the same place  without moving forward for a few minutes.  No sounds were noted.   The formation broke off and they disappeared behind the trees.  I took some pictures.  I was only able to capture three of the lights.  They were breaking formation by the time I got my camera and was able to focus on them.   They looked like stars or round balls of white light.;34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474
