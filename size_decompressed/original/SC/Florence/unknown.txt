Object Spotted over Florence SC - Bright Red and Blue Light;2011-12-10 17:50:00;3 minutes;Object Spotted over Florence SC - Bright Red and Blue Light For approximately 3 minutes, we witnessed what at first appeared to be an airplane slowly moving through the sky.  I wouldn't have given it a second look until I noticed a sharp blue color radiating from the light source.  My wife and I then stood outside our home and observed the object which constantly changed from red to bright blue, and briefly to white.  It seemed to move slowly around in a small circle for several turns before moving a short distance across the sky and repeating the process.  We continued to observe the object until it went below the tree line in the distance.  There was no sound, and normal air traffic was visible in the area which made it easier for us to quickly determine that it wasn't a plane.  As I stated before, its ability to fade from vibrant red to blue is what made this object stand out to me.  I could tell it was at a relatively  high altitude due to the fact that it would become briefly obscured by a nearby cloud.  I have ! never observed an object moving through the sky in such a manner, and clearly have no idea what we saw.
