Motionless pitch black triangular UFO just disappears;2004-09-20 21:30:00;1 minute;Motionless pitch black triangular UFO just disappears The date is approximate, the time of day is pretty close. I went out to the back yard to have a smoke. The sky was clear and it was fairly cool at ~60deg. F. I was looking in the sky for the usual planes landing at FLO Airport. I noticed that where a church had been pointing search lights up in the sky the week before, there was a totally black triangle shape with its base toward me. It was so black the ambient light in the sky made its shape out very crisply. It was SWW of Florence (to my reckoning it was about on a line from Florence to Shaw AFB that some military craft use occasionally). I figured it to be at least 2-3miles away and about 2000ft up. It did not move, nor did I see any light emitting from it. I would estimate its size to be in the 100ft wide range and twice as long, as well as about 20ft thick. This estimate is based on the lack of atmospheric scintillation. It could have been farther or even closer. It did not reflect any light that I could discern and that made it so black it stood out in the sky like a black nothing. As I put my thumb up to measure it, which was about 1/4 the width of my thumb at arms length, it seemed to just wipe itself away, from tip toward the base in about 1/2 a second. That was the first time I could say I saw a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));34.1817044765341;-79.7605283032474
