A circle, or orb, of bright flashing multi-colored lights, hovering in one place..;2012-09-15 22:00:00;1 hour;A circle, or orb, of bright flashing multi-colored lights, hovering in one place.. I was sitting outside with a friend looking up at the sky, which was incredibly clear, and noticed what looked to be a star that started blinking..of course this is out of the corner of my eye, so i look over to see what caught my attention and its a blinking circle type orb..it flashed multiple colors, red, blue, purple, pink, green nd white..it would slowly fade away then stay one, dim, blue, light and looked JUST like a normal star..it would then start slowly flashing, getting brighter and brighter..and it didnt move..it stayed in one place..;34.3072265734266;-79.8765762237761
