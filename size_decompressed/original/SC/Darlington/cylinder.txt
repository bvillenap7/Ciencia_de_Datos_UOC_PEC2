Cylindrical glowing object seen in clear sky at dusk by multiple witnesses.;2014-06-02 20:25:00;30 seconds;Cylindrical glowing object seen in clear sky at dusk by multiple witnesses. Went to take out the trash, turned and noted cylindrical object in the sky overflying my home.  Called immediately for the other witness.  Watched until object disappeared in the distance. Pace of object was slow relative to aircraft.  No flashing lights, self lit (glowing) white. Hard to tell how high it was, but I would have called it 'low flying' were it a plane.   No sound.   It's June, so dusk was just coming on, and visibility was excellent with very few, light clouds in the sky.   Object was approx as bright as a full moon.  Object left no trail.;34.3072265734266;-79.8765762237761
