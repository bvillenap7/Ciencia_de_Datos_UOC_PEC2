3 orange-red lights appeared in the sky to form a triangle.;2009-10-05 20:00:00;5 to 7 seconds;3 orange-red lights appeared in the sky to form a triangle. On October 5th, I was driving home after dark.  I approached the city limits just near my house.  I noticed something in the sky moderately above the tree line.  I thought it was a firework at first.  It was a light that had an orange-red color to it.  I focused my eyes on the object thinking since it was not a firework, maybe it was a plane.  After 2 seconds, two more lights appeared above the first light.  This formation was two lights on the top and one on the bottom.  All three lights stayed lit for about 4 seconds and then it disappeared at once.  At no time were these lights moving.  It was too large to be an aircraft.  I could not explain to myself what this object was.  There was a vehicle behind me and I almost stopped the person to see if they saw this object too.  I am in excellent health, no mental problems, and I am not crazy.  I dont know what this object was.  But, I do know that this was not your normal lights that appear in the night's sky. ! It was somewhat cloudy on that night on the way home.  There were breaks in the clouds as it went back and forth between clouds and stars.  Either way, I saw this weird object and I am not sure what it was.;34.3072265734266;-79.8765762237761
