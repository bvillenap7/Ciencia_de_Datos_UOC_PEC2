Afte;2002-11-30 17:30:00;10 minutes;I was was approximately 5:30 pm when I noticed a ball of light slowly decending. I then called my daughter to come out and see it. After watching for a few minutes she ran in to find the camera. By the time she came back out it had winked out. A few minutes after that two helicopters coming from Supmter (possibly the Air Force Base?) came out and started circling the area. About tem more minutes two more came out. Approximately 7:00 pm I saw a streak of light across the shy, it happened very quickly. One of the helicopters cut across the sky towards where the streak had been. More helicopters came out after that. I then saw the second streak around 9:00 pm and another helicopter proceeded to fly towards that streak, but both streaks were too fast. The helicopters stayed around all night.;34.3424;-80.5
