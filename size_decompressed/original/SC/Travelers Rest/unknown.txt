Four lights hovering above us, following us, then disappearing.;2011-02-26 03:30:00;1 min.;Four lights hovering above us, following us, then disappearing. It was early morning. The sky was clear, the weather calm.  Four of us were riding around trying to find local haunts to do some EVP work at, when we found our selves driving around in the northern area of Greenville County. We took a back road, and followed it out to try and get back to civilization. We approached an area where the highway intersects with another and decided to make a u-turn. That’s when the incident occurred. My wife had been looking out the back window noticing some strange lights behind us. She had mentioned it once or twice. As soon as we were doing the u-turn, she had hollered out “LOOK!” Still maintaining its course, four glowing lights of a dim green-orange color rotating counter-clockwise hovered above us at a low altitude and disappeared. My wife was left speechless, and she refuses to believe what she saw.  The other two passengers barely caught a glimpse of the lights.  I saw them out my window the same time as my wife. We keep our eyes to the sky now.  This incident is the closest I have ever seen this type of thing.  I thought I would share this, since I haven’t reported any of my incidents before.  Thank you.;35.0043999999999;-82.4310000000001
