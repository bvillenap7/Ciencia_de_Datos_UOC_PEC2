High altitude star like cluster of very high speed spherical light objects, changing light intensity;2011-04-09 05:30:00;5-7 minutes;High altitude star like cluster of very high speed spherical light objects, changing light intensity Objects appeared same light intensity of low magnitude star, however they were moving at very high rate of speed.  They seemed to appear from point directly over head and moving in different directions stretching across the horizon.  Sometimes even though they had a lower light intensity would radiate more light up to 3 or 4 times as bright.  Objects occasionally appeared to change direction.  Shape was round like a distant star, color and light was bluish white like a distant star.  Objects would change intensity and shine bright a few times during lateral travel.  Seemed to be a cluster.  After about 5-7 minutes, all disappeared, no new sightings occurred.    I'm an electrical engineer, self employed and university student viewed this sighting.;35.0043999999999;-82.4310000000001
