Orange orb seen May 5, 2015, in from upstate SC looking west over hills, moving S to N.;2015-05-05 15:00:00;20 minutes;Orange orb seen May 5, 2015, in from upstate SC looking west over hills, moving S to N. The first week of May, 2015, a moon sized orange orb, clear to see, but with a fuzzy aspect to it, moved from S to N over the upstate South Carolina Hills.    Out of a large picture window I look  W toward Travelers Rest, SC, toward the western most NC state line, or North Georgia.  I only see 3 to 7 mountains, depending on the weather.   It took 15 to 20 minutes to traverse this line of sight.   I was mesmerized as if this were perfectly normal,  and did not take a picture.
