I look up at the sky every night but own this night there was much clouds and heat lighting.  But to my north west I could see a bright light redish in color almost like the color red star in orion. I observed it for a while thinking it maybe it was a plane but after a while I noticed no movement I could see local aircraft moveing in and out of cloud cover but to the naked eye this object seem not to move I then ask for some binoculars to watch the object it seem to move very fast  up and down really fast.  Leaveing light trails behind it my girlfriend claims that the object returns every summer I know what I saw.  It was indeed real.It had to have been A UFO;35.0043999999999;-82.4310000000001

They would move very quickly around each other in no certain pattern.  Twice we saw beams come from them.  Then they just blinked out one by one.  I tried to video them but got very little good shots on my cheap phone.  Two witnesses, ages 48 and 52.;35.0043999999999;-82.4310000000001
