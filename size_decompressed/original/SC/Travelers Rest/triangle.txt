something i never want to see again atleast not this close.;1995-01-01 06:00:00;8 seconds;something i never want to see again atleast not this close. One morning before school years ago, I was a the bus stop. All I can seem to remember is glancing up to be suprised.   I saw a triangler shaped ufo very very quite almost no sound at all just above the tree line 20 feet from me. and the ufo was not even 100 yards from me.  I can remember bright but not bright lights from it but not the colors or location of them.   That is the only part i can remember my memory is very clouded. and i dont even remember seing it leave or in fact ever going to school. ok i only have a cell phone so no collect call can be made and not sure of the zip code of this new county im in.
