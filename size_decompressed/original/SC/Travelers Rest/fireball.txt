Red Fireball over highway and truck;2010-07-08 01:00:00;30 seconds;Red Fireball over highway and truck It was around 1:30am, July 8th 2010.  My husband and I were taking his friend to the store after work. We were going down HWY-25 by the walmart, just fixing to stop at a redlight.  When we both looked up at what appeared to be a bright red fireballish orb(approx. size of basketball/soccerball), floating in the air about 10-15 feet above us.  We drove right under it, and then I turned around to look at the red light, and it was no longer there.  As if it just dissapeared.  Nothing fell from the sky or anything, we drove right underneath it.  It would have hit our truck. There was no one around.  No other cars, nothing.  We thought it could have been a light hanging on a electric line or something, but there was no line and no lights when we looked back and drove by it again on the way home. It happened in a matter of seconds, and I was in such shock I could barely drive.  Its as though it came out of nowhere, appeared in front of my car, then vanished again.  I didn't ever see it from a distance driving up to it. Just once I got close to stopping, and after my husband confirmed I wasn't completely crazy by pointing at it as well.  Its just hours after it happened now and I have a horrible headache, which I felt fine before this sighting, as does my husband.;35.0043999999999;-82.4310000000001
