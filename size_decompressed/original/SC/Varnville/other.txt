The lights stayed there not moving for a few seconds then slowly started moving away from us down the street but it stayed right on top the trees could not make out what shape it was or what it was could not hear anything nor feel anything no wind no nothing.  So I decided to run in and grab my phone and take a video but my phone re-watching it was just snow I couldn't take any video of it.  It was moving away from us down the street towards our country store so we decided to get in the truck which took approximately 1 and a half to 2 minutes and drive towards it as we were going down the street it was gone, we had gone over the tracks in the direction of the lights into an open field parked got out and looked and see nothing! totally disappeared.  My husband does not believe in UFOs but he could not figure out for the life of him what we were seeing and neither could I.;32.8358;-81.026
