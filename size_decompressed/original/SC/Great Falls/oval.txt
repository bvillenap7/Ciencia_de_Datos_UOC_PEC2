Oval object 90 yards above field.;2005-09-13 23:40:00;13 mins;Oval object 90 yards above field. Coming home I turned onto a back country road and noticed a light coming across the sky to my left.  I thought it to be an airplane and continued on.   As I came into a clearing, I saw the light again only closer.  Real close.  It was hovering over a field on my left.   I got out of my car and watched it.  It was only about 90 yards above the ground.   It had two flashing lights on the side.  A bright light on the front.  On the back was a red glowing panel.  It made no sound.  I could have thrown something at it.   As I watched it it moved slowly and turned not crossing the road in front of me.  It started picking up speed as it moved forward.   I jumped back into my car and proceeded to chase it but by the time i got up to 70 and to the next clearing.  It was at least 2 miles ahead of me. I could not catch it.;34.5673;-80.9163
