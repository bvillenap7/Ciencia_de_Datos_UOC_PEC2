I was getting ready for my shower, and had a eerie feeling that I was being watched. Looked out my kitchen window facing east, and freaked abit. I saw a( I know not a normal UFO---but still was flying) dark gray hummingbird tha was about 12 in. long and had a wingspan of about a foot also. Black beady eyes( cameras), and a sharp-cone-shaped 'beak'. It's wings moved just like the Ruby-thoated ones we all see in our flowers, just a blur. It had come around my house and right up to my window--watching (recording??) and sat there(hovering)about 30 sec.. It then did as the rest of the hummingbirds do--autogryated(that is backed up and 'rolled' over and made a sweeping turn out of my yard). I have had other events that are NORMAL ufos'back 76&78, tho they scared me and caused me to almost loose it. I also live in a place that when I was kid that I was scared to death of---due to the little men tha walked up to me and asked me to describe the funny' mirrored ball to them. It was their power ball! Oh! the sighting in 78 was of a bright light that made moves as if it was trying to find a door out of a glass shoebox in the sky, then the 8 people tha were with me went to the Starr Fire dept. to ask them if they saw this. When they wree gone a STUBBY-winged PLANE made a silent arc down from the light and stopped in front of me, THEN I saw a 'pilot' & copilot get out and walked up to me, then BLANK till my friends got back. My friends were upset with me as I didn't know they were back for about a hour, the said I was like a zombie! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));34.3958;-82.6896
