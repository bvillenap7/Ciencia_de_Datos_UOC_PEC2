Strange orange lights in the night sky;2010-10-10 08:30:00;5-10 mins;Strange orange lights in the night sky I was sitting at home watching tv when my dog started barking at something outside.  So I got up to look and see if anyone was outside and to reassure my dog nobody was here when two orange balls of light caught my attention across the street right above the tree line.  They were hovering diagonally of each other with one to the bottom right of the other.  They seemed to be hovering for a few minutes and eventually disappeared from vision.   I googled orange lights in the sky and found a video on YouTube that looks almost 100% like what I saw.;34.3958;-82.6896
