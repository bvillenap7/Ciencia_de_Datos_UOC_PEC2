Small circular object  took out the tops of trees;1978-07-15 20:30:00;10 sec;Small circular object  took out the tops of trees In the summer of 1978 my friend and I were walking back into the woods beside my house to return my puppy to his pen.  Near the intersection of Hwy 21 and Harris Road.   I was 12 at the time.  We saw a circular object about 3-4 feet wide with a light shining out the front of it - like a headlight.   It was moving quickly just above the tops of the tall pine trees, and took out the tops some of the trees in its path.  It was heading south - towards the Catwaba River.   We were scared and ran home to tell my mom - she said we were crazy and to take that mess somewhere else.  We went out to the woods the next day, and saw the branches on the ground where the tops of about 4 trees had been cut off.

UFO? Over Fort Mill.;2013-11-26 06:00:00;30 seconds;UFO? Over fort mill. I was driving on U.S 21 road to my girlfriend's house when I see this bright yellow and green light in the sky.  At first glance I thought it was just an airplane but as I got closer it didn't move at all.  I looked up and it looked circular.  I took a video that I'm 100 percent sure it lasted roughly around 30 seconds.  When I arrived at my girlfriend's house it came only to be around 10 seconds.  Which I found it to be very strange to me.;35.0079361173817;-80.916327088036
