Five fireballs fying slowly across the Fort Mil, SC, sky at night sighting of a possible alien.  (NUFORC Note:  Serious report?? PD));2010-07-01 22:45:00;5 minutes;Five fireballs fying slowly across the Fort Mil, SC, sky at night and a sighting of a possible alien. I was standing outside the car with my girlfriend when I saw five fireball looking objects flying across the sky to the northwest.  I ran inside my house to get my mother and ordered my girlfriend to stay outside to watch the unidentified flying object go across the sky.  When I returned back outside, I saw that two of the fireball objects had disappeared and became less bright.   Eventually, the last three fireballs disappeared.   After seeing the UFOs, I was say goodbye to my girlfriend when a pale-skinned boy walked through the side of my yard with his hand in his mouth.  He approached a stop sign in front of the car lights and decided to just stop.   He/it stared at us for 6 seconds before running across the street in a raptor-like way.  After coming to the opposite side of the road, the creature slowed down and watched us as we watched it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
