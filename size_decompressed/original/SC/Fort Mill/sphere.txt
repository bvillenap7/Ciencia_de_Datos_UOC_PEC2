I took my dog for a walk and at the end of our sub-division is a side walk area located on Farmhouse Rd.  I was thinking in my head (there are no chemtrails in the sky and it would be a perfect opportunity to physically see a UFO) as strange as it sounds I am being 100% serious.  The second these thoughts were going on in my head a Big ball of light emerged up in the sky (at first I started thinking holy cow) and then I was ruling out everything because it did not streak across the sky, it did not flash or move, it just appeared for about 4-5 seconds way up in the sky and then poof it was no longer there.  I did experience static electricity throughout my entire body and immediately called my spouse who was at home.  I do feel as if something intelligent heard my thoughts--at least this is how I felt.  This was a fascinating experience and I hope to communicate more and see results (hopefully film it).;35.0079361173817;-80.916327088036
