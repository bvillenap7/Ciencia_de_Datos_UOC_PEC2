I was out feeding my horse and it was dark outside. I looked up and to the right and saw 3 red lights flying overhead. The size was about 2-3 times the size of the stars. They flew to the left in a semi circle but not in any sort of formation. They drifted randomly amongst themselves/not too far from one another. As they circled left, I heard the hum of what seemed to be an engine or motor. I kept watching them and as the circle was about halfway complete they went up at the same speed. I kept watching, I was thinking to myself if these things dissappear, I'm going to ((be very surprised)).. and that's exactly what they did. My sister then came outside wondering why I was taking so long. To be honest, I never asked how long I was out there to know if it was longer than I recall. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

grouping of  seven yellowish-white lights traveling in the sky;2007-07-04 23:45:00;4-5 minutes;grouping of  seven yellowish-white lights traveling in the sky We were sitting on the back porch, when my mother stood up in awe of something.  I assumed it was a late firework, and ran around to her side of the table.  There was a grouping of lights in the dark sky.  There were five, yellowish-white round lights in the sky.  They were traveling at a slow gliding pace through the dark sky.  There was no noise.  There was a sixth light following closely behind.  Further back a seventh light followed.  We ran through the house to the front door to continue seeing them.  We ran, excitedly exclaiming, It's a UFO.  We opened the front door and were able to continue watching them travel through the sky.  i immediately yelled for my husband to come quickly, that he had to see this.  He came out and also watched them as the went through the sky, the first five, then the sixth, and ultimately the seventh.  The first grouping made a wide turn to the east and the sixth and seventh made the same wide turn heading east as if following.  There was no noise outside at that time.  it was very quiet with no sound of any kind.  The objects were not at a high enough level for aircraft and certainly had no corresponding sounds.  They were not fireworks as they stayed on the same level trajectory and same consistent light.  Embers from fireworks would have died down and gone towards the ground. We all three are certain we did not see any type of aircraft or fireworks.  The objects were lower than aircraft but much higher than birds would fly. We can not explain what would have caused this unusual sight.;35.0079361173817;-80.916327088036
Strange Lights in sky over Fort Mill, SC (just south of Charlotte NC);2010-09-16 21:30:00;15 minutes;Strange Lights in sky over Fort Mill, SC (just south of Charlotte NC) I was driving through a neighborhood called Knightsbridge in Fort Mill, SC around 9:30pm this evening.  My 16 year old brother and his best friend were with me.  I saw 3 lights in a diagonal line then a 4th appeared out of nowhere.  The lights were an orange/yellow color.  My brother and I dropped his friend off and then stopped and watch the lights some more.  They increased out of nowhere to 6 and then formed a V shape in the sky.  I took pictures on my phone but they did not come out.  These were not planes it was as if they were standing still.  They were not street lights or anything like that.  These things were HUGE!;35.0079361173817;-80.916327088036

It was going at a fast speed then it really started going fast and then slowed down to its original speed.;35.0079361173817;-80.916327088036
Series of 6 silent fiery-orange lights moving across night sky;2011-06-25 22:00:00;2 min.;Series of 6 silent fiery-orange lights moving across night sky June 25, 2011 Fort Mill, SC, (approaching Charlotte, NC)  Tonight, right at 10:00 P.M. as I was driving towards Charlotte, NC, from Fort Mill, SC a series of six deep orange glowing objects appeared  in the night sky.   They were moving in a linear fashion, and although some distance apart seemed to be following each other in formation and moving in a north/northeast direction. At first I though it must be a series of airplanes moving towards Charlotte airport, but it quickly became apparent that these were not airplanes.  There was no sound, and the burning glow these things generated bore no resemblance to airplane lights. The sight was so unusual that I pulled over to the shoulder and got out of the car to watch.  These objects looked like a series of large orange streetlights moving across the sky, and there was a fire-like quality to them.  As each moved overhead, it would suddenly get smaller, shrink to pin-point size and vanish completely. This was the most unusual (and unnatural) thing I’ve ever seen, and somewhat unsettling.  It probably took the better part of two minutes for them all to pass overhead and disappear.  This was very real, and it will be on my mind for a while.;35.0079361173817;-80.916327088036
Orange orbs moving in formation and 'winking out;2012-01-14 18:20:00;less than 8 minutes;Orange orbs moving in formation and 'winking out I went out side around 6:20 and saw 3 orange spheres moving rapidly up from the NW toward Charlotte . I am in the Fort Mill, SC AREA. The formed up a triangle, hanging motionless. Then Two of the orange lights appeared to merge into one, then slowly vanished. My neighbor and my wife both saw this. My neighbor stood outside watching as two more orange orbs move upward and hung motionless in the same area as the other 3 had been. These were brighter, more orb-like. The hung there motionless, sometimes they looked like they were dancing around each other until they vanished. Two more, much brighter and more spherical rose up from the same direction. They were much brighter than the previous 5 that I had seen.  My Neighbor and I continued to watch. These too slowly faded out, to a low magnitude star-like appearance, then disappeared. I asked my neighbor if he had ever seen anything like this.  He said he was a trained pilot, had been in the military and seen a lot of aircraft, but none behaved like this. There was a lot of air traffic coming  out of Charlotte Airport (we are in the flight path and one airplane flew almost directly over head.  In the distance, beyond the tree line I could see other aircraft making their approach to the airport. What ever these orange orbs were, they did not behave like aircraft.  Nor were they meteors and fireballs (I have observed and reported these also in the past to the American Meteor Society). They were not planets, or stars (I’ve been a sky watcher/amateur astronomer for years). They did not behave like fireworks. I did not notice any more orbs after 6:28PM, as I was taking garbage to recycle.  I keep looking but failed to observer any further orange orbs as I drove off and came back. I do not know what these were.  But there were at least 3 witnesses who observed the same thing in the sky. I would be happy to discuss this with someone and show them where I saw the orbs.  I reported this to MUFON. They also had similar sighting on that evening.;35.0079361173817;-80.916327088036
