Light across the sky;2014-07-16 22:00:00;5 minutes;Light across the sky I was sitting outside, enjoying the cool weather, smoking a cigar. I look up out over the trees, and see 3 or 4 lights in a long straight Diagonal line.  At 1st I think they are planes, but they are blinking Faster than I've ever seen, almost like strobe lights they were Blinking so fast. Each light was just 1 dot.  White.  Maybe a little Reddish in the light.  I also noticed they were blinking in a pattern In unison.  They were moving perfectly in synch so I believe it was 1 large craft.  It was moving steadily below the tree line and further away.   Took about 5 minutes before it was out of site.;35.0079361173817;-80.916327088036
