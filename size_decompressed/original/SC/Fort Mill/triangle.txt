Triangular craft with lights are corners with multi row lights in front;2014-12-16 17:00:00;:60;Triangular craft with lights are corners with multi row lights in front Noticed an usual series of lights at a much lower altitude than the planes that often circle before landing at the Charlotte Douglas airport.  There were apron 13 bright white lights in what appeared to to be a straight up and down configuration..   As I continued down rt160, the bright white lights went away and I say a triangular solid against the gray background , and lights were seen in each point of the triangle..  The up and down bank of lights was no longer viewable.   As I continued to observe, it was clear that he craft was banking, so saw the lights head on as banking and the lights were were facing away from me, then the underside was viewable..
