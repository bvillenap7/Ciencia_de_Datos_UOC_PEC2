Lights hovering above tree line;2012-09-22 05:30:00;10 minutes;Lights hovering above tree line Around 5:30am in Fort Mill, South Carolina I saw a rectangular shaped object with a light at each end it was hovering above the tree line making an 8 formation.  It was making a noise that cannot be described.   After about 10 minutes, all of the lights shut off, with 1 light remaining in the back of the object and it zoomed away.;35.0079361173817;-80.916327088036
