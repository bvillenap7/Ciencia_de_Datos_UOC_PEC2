Two triangle craft observed over Harleyville.;2015-10-22 03:00:00;20 minutes;Two triangle craft observed over Harleyville. At around 0330 Thursday October 22nd, 2015, myself and a co-worker observed two triangle shaped craft over Harleyville, SC.  Both craft were dark in color with red lights on the corners (non-flashing) and flew just above the tree line roughly 300 feet from our building.   They were moving slowly at first coming back and forth across a heavily wooded area as if they were looking for something.  They then hovered over the wooded area for about 5 minutes before accelerating very quickly upwards and then making an immediate 90Â° turn across the sky to the west and disappearing into the distance.   Local police scanner revived multiple calls about the 2 craft over the area.;33.2213;-80.4547
