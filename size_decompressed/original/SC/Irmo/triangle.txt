Noticed white lights visible from Interstate 26 westbound at Route 76 exit. Appeared to be 2-3 lights close together, side by side. They did not appear to be moving. As we got off the Interstate, heading southwest on 76, saw that the lights were ahead of us, appearing to be over Dutch Fork Elementary School. As we passed to the southeast of the lights, I was looking almost straight up at them and saw they were three white lights in a triangular formation, equalateral, with a red flashing light in the middle. I had not seen the red light until I was looking up at the object from underneath. The lights began moving slowly southeast along Route 76 towards Columbia. The red center light was blinking once every second or two, but as the object moved away it seemed to not be blinking constantly. It would appear to stop for a few seconds and then start. The object was eventually went below the horizon towards the east-southeast and could not be seen anymore. There had been heavy helicopter activity in the area since nightfall. A train was in the area as well at the time, so it was impossible to hear if it may have been a helicopter. It appeared to be, at most, a couple thousand feet up. The pattern of lights seemed too big for a helicopter, unless it had sponsons or wings with running lights. At arms length the pattern was the diameter of a penny, or slightly smaller, when it was seen almost overhead.;34.1108;-81.1949999999998
