We stopped, got out of the car.  There was no sound from it. It hovered right above the grocery store.  There were lights all across the front.  We watched it until it was gone about 5 minutes.;34.1108;-81.1949999999998
UFO sited 3 times in Columbia SC area, approximately 22 hours each time.;2013-11-16 21:54:00;>10 minutes;UFO sited 3 times in Columbia SC area, approximately 22 hours each time. This is the third time I have seen this object.  Today 11/16/2013, Thursday 11/14/2013 and earlier in the week but I do remember exactly which day.  Each siting happened approximately 22 hours. Object was seen just above a tree line.  It was cigar/flat shaped, had a red light on one side, a green on the other and seemed to be strobing bright white light in the center.  It appears out of no where....hovers, moves slightly left, and right, went down below the tree line and up again, and on one occasion, did a kind of loop.  It then just disappears. This is definitely not an airplane. Tonight, I had a friend witness this with me and we used a binoculars to look at it. We could easily make out the colors, but no definition of the center with the low power binoculars. My site is Irmo SC, but the object was off to the West.;34.1108;-81.1949999999998
