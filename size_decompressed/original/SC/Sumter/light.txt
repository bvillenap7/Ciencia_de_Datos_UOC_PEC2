Staionary light in the sky which appeared to be disintegrating.;2007-11-12 20:30:00;47 min;Staionary light in the sky which appeared to be disintegrating. At approximately 9:30 I exited my house into the backyard to call in the cat, when I noticed what looked like a bright star in the sky, which appeared to be disintegrating. The objecty was not moving, but had what looked like sparks or specks of light falling from it. I immediately thought it was it was a shooting star or some kind of meteor, but it didn't appear to be moving. The dripping lights slowed down and stopped after 30 minutes or so, and the light remained stationary for another 15 minutes or so before moving to the left sharply and then quickly vanishing.

Unexplained light that shone in my eyes and lit up and area of my yard;2012-09-17 22:30:00;3-4 minutes;Unexplained light that shone in my eyes and lit up and area of my yard Sitting outside on my deck at approximately 10:30 pm 9/17/2012 I observed a ball of light in the SSW.  I live near SHAW AFB, and they were doing night maneuvers however this ball of light suddenly appeared ....no trail coming from any aircraft, from the ground up or any beam associated with it.  This did not have any flashing lights, never moved or changed position or shape.  Next the intensity of the light, as though looking into a head light, shone directly on my face like a spot light and actually lit a path as such in my yard in front of me.  Thinking it could have been a helicopter with a spotlight however it never moved and again had no other flashing lights...suddenly it simply disappeared. No fading, no gradual dissipation , just gone.  I have lived here most of my life and having been raised in an Air Force family know what aircraft look like at night.  Also I spend many an hour on my patio & deck and have never witnessed anything like this ever.  I kno! w what aircraft flares are, ball lightning, and this was not anything like that.  I have sought all possible realistic explanations and I have none.;33.9043153965786;-80.3718488335922
Small, bright white light moving from West to East in Midlands of South Carolina.;2014-08-23 21:30:00;75 seconds;Small, bright white light moving from West to East in Midlands of South Carolina. Was walking the dog, then looked up and saw a small, but intense white light moving across the sky.  It was solid white--not blinking or twinkling.   It was moving from West to East.  It was definitely not an aircraft.  Not a sound was heard.   After about a minute...its slowly faded into the atmosphere and was gone.   I'm still baffled as to what it was, but I would testify under oath that it was not any sort of airplane.;33.9043153965786;-80.3718488335922
