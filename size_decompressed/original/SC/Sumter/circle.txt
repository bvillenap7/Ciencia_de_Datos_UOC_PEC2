This object was also reported to Shaw AFB. It appeared in the police blotter in the shaw spirit (base paper). I was watching TV when I saw a bright light come through my window. I looked out to see who was shining it in my house when i noticed a hovering object circular in shape approximately 75 yards away. I immediately went to wake my wife so she could also see it. Returning to the window I noted that the object was beginning to lift higher. returning to my bedroom i again tried to wake her. this time she came in but it had already climbed high enough that only if you knew what you were looking for could you see it. I didn't say anything more about it till i saw it in the base paper. then i told my wife the details. It made no sound, and the light it gave off made no shadow. It climbed at a rate no jet I've seen can make. 2 weeks after this event my neighbors were over for dinner, they breached the subject by saying your gonna think we're crazy. But we saw a UFO in your yard just 2 weeks ago.. Needless to say we exchanged our views of that night and they matched exactly. My background is a avionics Technician for the ((Deleted)). I was in the airforce for ((Several--# deleted)) years. I was retired medically for a injury incurred from a ((Reason deleted)). Which brings up another weird event. my 2nd day home from the hospital, i had a most troubling dream that i was being dragged from bed and dragged through some tall grass toward a bright light. I awoke that morning and woke the wife to go make breakfast, as i sat up she asked what was on my back. Then she brushed off a handfull of grass seed... I told her about that nights dream. and we both agreed it was weird. She says she remembers waking that night and i wasn't in bed, she thought i was on the computer so gave no thought to it. when we entered our front room, my brother 14 years old, was sleeping on the couch. he asked where we went last night. We said no where, why? He said he heard the door open and close once, like someone had left but never heard anyone return.;33.9043153965786;-80.3718488335922

It was early in the morning and I was standing at the bus stop just looking up at the sky then noticed that a circular light started to move very slowly I didn't say anything until another person said hey do you see that thing moving in the sky.  I agreed and while we both were looking the circular object disappeared.;33.9043153965786;-80.3718488335922
