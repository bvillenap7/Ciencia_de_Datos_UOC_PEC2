Classic saucer shaped object overhead at midday.;1991-07-15 12:00:00;<10 minutes;Classic saucer shaped object overhead at midday. While returning from vacation at Myrtle Beach, the 4 of us stopped at a gas station to refuel.  It was a clear sunny midday. The other gentleman noticed this classic saucer shaped object overhead.  Could not tell the size.  (ie. large and far away or small and closer) Nothing to compare it too at the time.  It appeared to look very similar to the poster that is now shown on X-files.  It was saucer shaped, domed and had dark areas around the lower part of the dome.  Windows?  It was slowly rotating with a slight wobble.  No sound, no lights, no exhaust trails, nothing.  Since we were close to an Air Force base at the time, I went into the station and asked the clerk to come outside and look.  Since there were no planes/jets around, I figured it might be a military protype.  She said she had never seen anything like it before.  It was moving slowly away.  No one thought to take a picture and by the time I though of using the binoculars, it was far enough away that the detail was no greater than when we first saw it.  Everyone at the gas station was staring and pointing at it.  I have been searching the net for years now to see if there were any reports in the newspapers of that time -- but have found nothing yet.;33.9043153965786;-80.3718488335922
((HOAX??))  2 UFO Sumter South Carolina, May 1st 2012;2012-05-01 04:00:00;40 seconds;2 UFO Sumter South Carolina, May 1st 2012 I was outside smoking a cigarette when my friend sitting next to me yelled out look! look! what i saw were 2 gigantic disc shaped air crafts coming from behind the treeline side by side very close to the top of the pine trees across from my front porch.  They both appeared be around 30-50 feet in diameter each moving around 7 mph.  They both seemed to be synced in movement and timing. They didnt make any sound They were so close we could almost count the number of round light bulbs under the bottom of the objects as they slowly passed above our head.  The lights were bright but didnt reflect of brighten anything under it.  Each object had a circular pattern of lights directly in the center of the bottom made out of the same round light bulbs that surrounded the outside ring of both 2 objects. the center circle of lights under the bottom in the center pulsated energy in a counterclockwise motion with each bulb changing colors like a rainbow in a synchronized patt! ern repeatedly like it was feeding the outside ring which moved in the opposite direction over and over form the center ring of bulbs. The line of bulbs that came from the center circle were in a pattern like a mint candy with the curved swirly lines instead of straight lines like a bicycle rim. one ring sending colors in a circle, bulb to bulb and the outside ring being fed from the line of colorful bulbs in the other direction. 2 of them side by side, what appeared to be 5 - 10 ft apart. when 1 tilted to the right so did the other. synced! True Story.  We watched them go east towards Bishopville SC. and the whole time i had my friend phone in my hand.  To amazed to take a picture i was stuck.  Next day I left and went to vist a friend when I recieved a call from my mother telling me 2  Agents came by looking for me.  The truth is out here!

2 big  saucer disc with light bulbs around the outside moving colors.;2012-05-19 09:00:00;45 seconds;2 big  saucer disc with light bulbs around the outside moving colors   I walked outside my front door to smoke a cigarette with an acquaintance, upon being outside for no longer than a minute when suddenly my acquaintance called to my attention 2 very large disc shaped objects moving northeast in our direction from behind the row of pine trees across from my home. Each object was about the diameter of a local McDonald's moving slowly above the top of the pine trees no more than 15-25 mph.  The crafts appeared to be moving in a synchronized pattern. Each disc had at least 100-200 round light bulbs going around the outside of the disc in a complete circle. Each circle bulb pulsating in a domino like effect.  1 bulb sent energy to the next over and over going from red, to yellow to green to blue and so on in a clockwise motion while there was a smaller ring of lights under the bottom of each craft doing the exact same thing but in an opposite counter-clockwise motion while being the source for all the energy feeding the outside bulbs down a series of 7 or 8 lines like the swirls in a mint candy or bicycle spokes.  Both at the same time.  It was so close It looked like Las Vegas in the sky but strangely did not leak a drop of light nor a shadow to anything under it.  They did not make a sound and one was like a duplicate of the other as far as movement and light synchronization. So to make a short story...2 big  saucer disc with light bulbs around the outside moving colors from 1 bulb to the next.  They had a smaller ring under the bottom that did the same thing counterclockwise. the smaller circle of lights feeding the out side circle of bulbs though a couple of mint candy type swirl of round bulbs repeatedly;33.9043153965786;-80.3718488335922
