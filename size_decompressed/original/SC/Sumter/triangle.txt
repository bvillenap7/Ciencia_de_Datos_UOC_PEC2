triangle shaped object-3 bright lights-blinked in a pattern-made no sound;2006-02-02 20:30:00;30 seconds;triangle shaped object-3 bright lights-blinked in a pattern-made no sound My daughters and I were heading home after eating dinner at my mother-in-law's house.  We live in the country, away from the bright lights of the town, so we have a good view of the night sky.  At first we saw a bright orange light that zoomed across the sky.  We thought it was a shooting star, but then it just stopped in the sky.  Then the light changed to a bright white light and we saw two more lights. They were in a triangular shape and they were blinking in a pattern. We live mear Shaw Air Force Base and we are used to air craft and jets flying over our house. This object did not make any noise. My husband was in his truck behind us and he saw it too.  We saw it for about 30 seconds and then it just disappeared.  It was just so eerie, not only to see, but the feeling that went through my body was just indescribable.  It just sent chills through me.  We did not report it.;33.9043153965786;-80.3718488335922

Triangular shaped object illuminating constant bright light over sumter, sc;2010-10-26 20:00:00;2 mins;Triangular shaped object illuminating constant bright light over sumter, sc The sighting occurred at 20:00 hours in Sumter, SC on 10/26/10.  The object was triangular in shape emitting a constant bright white light. The light emitting from this object did not flicker nor had any variation to it.  There were no atmospheric between myself and the other two witnesses and the object. The object moved in a very slow manner across the sky and then completely disappeared.  All witnesses to this event cited seeing the exact same object and description.  Also note at 20:00 it was a clear sky.  The object was also silent and had no emitting noise from it.  This object was also seen at the same location a few weeks prior to this incident with the exact same details as listed with the incident stated above.;33.9043153965786;-80.3718488335922
An unknown object appeared in the hour of darkness;2011-08-02 01:00:00;07:15;An unknown object appeared in the hour of darkness While looking into the night skys it came to notice that a particular seemingly star was moving faster than others. At this time my patience grew stronger as watching this specific seeming object closer.   As I continued my observations.  The white/bright unknown object began panning left to right/ forward then backwards at a high rate of frequencies.  I then became to wonder if I could any planes or helicopter.  The nught was very quite, nor did the sound of either could be heard. As the sun began to rise I requested that my co-worker to meet with me as to showing him what taking placed.   As my co-worker looked at the unknown bright object/light in the morning sky.  He stated thats a star.   He further stated its moving. I then asked him how many others stars were visible.  He stated none.   The unknown white/bright object continued to move from left to right then forward to backward.   After the sun had displayed complete daylight the object colorations changed to a light grayish tone as it appeared to inclined upward.;33.9043153965786;-80.3718488335922
Triangular object with blinking red light at bottom of craft with a smaller object ahead of it;2017-01-18 21:00:00;15 minutes;Triangular object with blinking red light at bottom of craft with a smaller object ahead of it Was outside walking my cousin's dogs with her 11 year old son.  We were marveling at Orion, as he was pretty high in the Eastern sky.  We turned and walked with our back to Orion, and I looked up (towards the West) and saw a triangular object moving EXTREMELY slowly towards the N/NW in the direction of Charlotte, NC (I'm 2.5 hours from there, but just trying to give some perspective of its movement).  We were able to observe it for 15 minutes before the dogs and the 11 year old got restless.  I came back outside, but the object was beyond the far tree lines.  I live with open fields around me in a rural area close to an Air Force base (Shaw AFB). The object was definitely an equilateral triangle with a slow-blinking red light in the middle.  It was low enough that I would be confident in saying the light was at the bottom of a convex/downward dome.  The points of the triangle had white lights that were not blinking.  I would estimate the width of the craft to be on par that of the wingspan of a Boeing 747.   Ahead of the object and to its left was a much smaller craft that was simply a red light as though it were towing the larger craft--definitely guiding the path for sure.  The light on that smaller craft was not blinking.  I could not make out the shape of this object, but the red light appeared as a dot from my vantage point. I heard zero engine noise.  Since Shaw AFB is home to an F-16 fighter wing, so I know what F-16 engines sound like, even at idle.  This object wasn't making any noises that any aircraft would make, much less an F-16.  I was stunned at how slowly the craft was moving and amazed it was able to stay in the air without me hearing any engine noise.;33.9043153965786;-80.3718488335922
Triangle shape.  3 red/orange flashing lights at each corner of the triangle.  Circular and triangular motion. ((anonymous report));2018-04-11 21:00:00;30 minutes;Triangle shape.  3 red/orange flashing lights at each corner of the triangle.  Going in circular and triangular motion.  Then up and down. I saw a triangle shape.  Alone.  No stars.  No airplanes.  At each corner of the triangle, there was a flashing orange light.  The triangle was moving in a circular motion... then a triangular motion.  And kept doing that on and off.  Would get closer to me.  Then would go back closer to te sky.  They seem as if they wanted to communicate and send a warning...  I was by myself.  I watched this for 30 minutes and I got bored bc they kept doing the same thing. So I went back inside while they continued to do this for a long time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
