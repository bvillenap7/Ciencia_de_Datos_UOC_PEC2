I noticed from just above tree level a craft surrounded by lights emerging from just above tree top level.  At first it appeared to be a small triangular object decorated with lights such as a hang glider.  Then as more of the object drifted into view it appeared to be one huge object that was made up of three smaller triangular objects.  Almost as if three hang gliders were attached together making up a larger triangular object.  As more of it became visible and it drifted into full view I realized that it was not hang gliders due to the enormous size of it.  It was almost silent.  Perhaps a small engine sound was barely audible such as a putter or hum, but not sure about that.  Then just as if it realized that it had drifted into a populated area it stopped, hovered, then the lights blinked once.. twice... three times... then absolutely dark it went.  But it was bright night and you could still see the object hovering above.  It then made a slow lumbering change of direction back to the cover of the tree top canopy and away from the interstate.  If you've ever seen the floating laboratory that scientists use to study the rain forest canopy in South America.  It is a floating helium filled raft like craft used by scientsts to drift over the rain forest and gather data and experiments.    This UFO was similar to that with lights.  I'm convinced that it is definitely man made due to it's crudeness and slow mobility.  It probably is hydrogen cel or helium and is manned by military special ops types doing training ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
