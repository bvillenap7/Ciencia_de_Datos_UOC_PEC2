They seem to have a leader, a large orange ball of light with four smaller  lights.  They do formations and gravitate toward the large light, which is  usually always in the  center.  They always do this in the same spot, although I have seen them over the river as well. My 12 year old son and I have witnessed these craft and their formations and maneuvers for approximately three years now.  We always keep our distance, although the craft have begun to come toward us at times. The leader can pull the other lights in and shoot them out from the top, side, or bottom.  They can disappear and reappear, but when they seem to be finished doing whatever it is they're doing, they either fly away or disappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
