The inmates on the yard watched a triangle shaped aircraft fly directly over the prison not far above tree level height and completely silent.  It moved slowly and kept moving. We were all confused and talked about it for a few days after that.  The next night after that I was informed to have the inmates off the yard before dark. I wonder if it was something from the government because of the announcement to have the inmates off the yard immediately following this event.  I only recently learned of other sightings during this time period which caused me to remember my sighting.;34.6498000000001;-82.4652999999999
Large, black, triangular, object flew low and silent over South Carolina state prison yard.;1997-10-01 19:00:00;3 minutes;Large, black, triangular, object flew low and silent over South Carolina state prison yard. While working as a Correctional officer at Perry Correctional Institution I was working in the medical ward. The inmates were allowed to be out on the rec yard until a certain time and in fall it would become dark before they had to come in. One evening after dark I and several inmates witnessed an object fly low over the prison and directly above us. It was huge, black, moved very slow and made no noise. I did not report it at the time because I had applied for federal law enforcement and didn't want to be labeled a nut. We (the inmates and myself) joked about it a few times but as far as I know it was never reported. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
