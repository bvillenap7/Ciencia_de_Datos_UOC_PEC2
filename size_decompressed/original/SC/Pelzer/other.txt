Long object circle the moon.;2017-12-04 07:15:00;Seconds;Long object  circle the moon. As I walked outside this morning I was looking at the moon.  Then, I saw a dark line that was about 75% across the moon, moving left to right.  I've seen airplanes leave contrails in front of the moon before but this wasn't that.  This looked more like it was in orbit around the moon.  Like I said it covered about 3/4 the distance across and also had a slight curve to its path.  It only lasted a few seconds as it appeared to pass around the moon.;34.6498000000001;-82.4652999999999
