Intense orange light.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;~1 minute;My wife and I were sitting on the front porch when I noticed a really intense orange light.   At first I thought it was fireworks but it never fell.   I got up and walked out in the yard to get a better look and called to my wife to come look.   The light  contuied to get closer and in a few seconds was over our neighbors house.   I had to run to the back yard the keep it in sight.  It was gone within 10 seconds. The whole thing lasted no more than 45 seconds. Hard to guess the speed but from where it appeared to where I lost sight was probably about 3 miles. It was traveling south.;34.6498000000001;-82.4652999999999
