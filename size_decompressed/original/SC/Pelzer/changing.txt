It was 3 red lights all spaced out in the shape of a perfect triangle, the objects moved slowly foward but then stopped and en t backwards and just stayed there untill exactly 5:30am.  The second time 09/03/2010 wich is what i am reporting now the same objects were spotted in the same area as the first time. I sat and watched them change shape and color from red to green.  i watched them untill the sun began to rise and as I was watching an airplane came by and it looked as though it scared the objects because 2 of them disapeared and the 3rd looked as though it was lost because it began to move back and forth and all around as though it was on a winding road and finally disappeared completely. It was to say the least..amazing.;34.6498000000001;-82.4652999999999
