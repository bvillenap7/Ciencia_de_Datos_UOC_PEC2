Steam power plant;2004-08-15 21:30:00;1.5 munites;Steam power plant I was with my father on our way home from my sisters house.It was very dark and foggy as we pass a steem plant. My father was driving real slow and i was just looking toward the plant. Its about a half mile off the road and at the entrance is a large open area.  As soon as we approached the open field i saw a wierd set of lights.The closer i got the bigger they got. There were two beams of light coming down from about 50 feet and about 75 feet from the road. The beams would flash on and off very strangely.Once,three times,twice,three times and so on.one beam was about 8 feet at the top and about 10 feet at the bottom. The other beam was about 12 feet at the top and about 14 feet wide at the bottom.They were wight and very,very intense! I noitced looking at the beems where they should have hit the ground ,It did not illumeanate. As i got a colser look at the top of the beems there was a dim oval outline. I wish everybody could have seen it.  P.S. i was pretty close to this thing and i never heard a thing. I never saw it move it was kind of spooky!

Oval object seen on film (camera) but not visible to the naked eye).;2016-05-23 02:00:00;>1 second;Oval object seen on film (camera) but not visible to the naked eye). This was an event during 5th grade Field Days at an elementary school.  If you look up at the top center you will see an object that wasn't seen live, but was visible after the pictures were uploaded.  It seems as if the craft is operating in the IR range of the electromagnetic spectrum.  It was also taken in the exact same place as that one from 2012 was taken (next report).;34.6498000000001;-82.4652999999999
