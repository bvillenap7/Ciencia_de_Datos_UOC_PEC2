After stopping my car i watched the light for at least 5-6 seconds before they went off. I rolled down the window on the drivers side of my vehicle  to see if i could hear a sound i.e. plane. helicoper etc. No sound was heard. i could not detect the shape of the object that the lights were attached too. when i drove in the direction of the light i still could not hear a sound.As i looked to my right i saw a red light flashing beneath an object traveling south just above the tree tops. This object made no sound as it traveled paralled with interstate 95 and towards the south. I live in the area where i observed the light. I am a college graduate with  a background in science and I also spent two years in the military.;33.8644;-80.1276
