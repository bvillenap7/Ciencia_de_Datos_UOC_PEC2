Bright orange light seen  hovering in sky, disappears and then reappears;2004-10-20 20:15:00;30-40 seconds;Bright orange light seen  hovering in sky, disappears and then reappears We were standing on the front lawn of Union Presbyterian Church off Hwy 377, facing NW (towards Kingstree, SC) when a bright orange light appeared in the sky, at the level of what a small aircraft might fly. The light was much smaller than the moon would appear, but much larger than a normal star or planet.  The light was stationary for about 15 seconds, with no sound. Then it faded quickly and instantaneously reappeared in a different location not far from where it was originally seen but far enough that it could not have been an airplane and reappear that quickly. The light was just suddenly bright again, lasted another 10 to 15 seconds and faded quickly again. We waited, but saw nothing further.;33.5623;-79.834
Saw the same lights again tonight that we saw on October 20, 2004.;2004-12-07 18:30:00;30 seconds;Saw the same lights again tonight that we saw on October 20, 2004. My husband and I were driving North on Hwy 52 somewhere between Lane and Salters when we saw the same bright orange light my husband saw in his Oct 20 report in Salters on Hwy 377. We both saw it this time. There were two of them that appeared simultaneously.  They appeared  at the same time, side by side in the sky about the same level as before.  The lights were stationary for about 20 to 30 seconds, then they faded quickly.;33.5623;-79.834
