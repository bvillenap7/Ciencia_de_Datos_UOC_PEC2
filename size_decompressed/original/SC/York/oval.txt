Bright colorful lights, capsule shaped object;2020-09-11 03:30:00;1.5 hours;Bright colorful lights, capsule shaped object Object was stationary a majority of the time.  Bright lights around the middle changing from white to blue to red and then a night lavender.  Lights faded into other colors.  It was distant but I could see a faint outline above and under the object.  It was shaped like a Tylenol capsule lengthwise. Long part up and down, not side to side.  I was sleeping on my couch and woke up and noticed the light in the sky from my front window.  I went outside to get a better look.  It occasionally moved quickly from left to right.  Over the next hour and a half or so, I kept going out to see if it was still there.   My last venture out, it moved away to the left quickly and disappeared.  The lights were extremely bright, and the color changes were almost rhythmic.  Beautiful colors.  There was a haze above and below the lights that outlined an oval capsul like shape.  I saw this one other time months ago but it only was around about ten minutes.  This time it was an extended time;34.9969;-81.2259
