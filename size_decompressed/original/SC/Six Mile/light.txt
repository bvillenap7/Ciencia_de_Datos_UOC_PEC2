I thought someone was messing with the horses so I ran downstairs and grabbed a powerful flashlight and went outside and pointed the light down Duncan road.  Nothing was there, there was no sound, absolutely nothing was visible or could be heard. I scanned the flashlight beam all around and the horses were resting and did not appear disturbed.  I forgot about it.  Shortly after that I heard a crash on the porch and a chair with cat food on it was turned over with no sign of an animal.  This could have been a raccoon or something.  My wife works late and got home about 00:30 after midnight and I told her about the chair, but did not mention the lights. Today on 6/12 my wife and I were coming home from eating lunch and she mentioned she saw four lights red and yellow on Mile Creek road where Love Care road intersects.  This is no more than a mile from our house. She said the lights moved rapidly off to one side and were gone.  She thought it was someone with a trailer in a nearby house, but when she passed nothing was there.  We decided her sighting and mine were very coincidental and unusual and may be worth reporting;34.8297;-82.8257
