Five lights created a triangular shape that darted and bounced around for about one hour.;2005-12-27 04:00:00;1 hour;Five lights created a triangular shape that darted and bounced around for about one hour. At first I thought it was an airplane in the distance, but then it continued to hover and bounce around in the same area for about an hour.  It had one bright light in the middle and a smaller light directly above the bright light and three small lights in a horizontal row below the birght light, giving it a triangular arrangement of the lights.  I woke my little sister up to prove to myself that I was not dreaming or halucinating.  We watched the object for about an hour before returning to bed around 5:00 am.  It seemed to be shooting flares to either side and the light changed from white to red and green or blue.  It was rather far away, but it was obvious that it was moving in a pattern that was not consistent with that of an airplane or helecopter.  At times it would dart in a diagonal direction and then bounce around then dart in another direction and bounce some more.  The light grew brighter then dimmed several times while we were watching it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.8734;-82.9559
