From Fairmont, NC to Hamer, SC, when out of nowhere what seems to be a long object with a light at both ends.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-17 20:56:00;2 minutes;Driving home from Church from Fairmont, NC, to Hamer, SC, when out of nowhere what seems to be a long object with a light at both ends came very close to the ground.  No noise heard after windows were rolled down.  Craft seemed to be banking toward right side yet flying straight and hoovering for a small amount of time before flying away.   My son took a picture and it was a blurred circular light on his iphone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.4829;-79.3491
