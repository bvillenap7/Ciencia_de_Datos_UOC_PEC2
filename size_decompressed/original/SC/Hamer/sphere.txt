2 orange spheres.;2019-08-26 20:45:00;5-7 minutes;2 orange spheres I was sitting on my porch and saw a flash of light. I thought it was lightning so I looked up and saw a very bright sphere with an orange glow.  It was moving very slow and the light was pulsating or the object was rotating.  I ran in the house and got my son and father-in-law.  Came back out and saw it again. It would go from dim to dark to extremely bright.  It was still moving slow and stopping.  All of a sudden it shot up into air and disappeared, but came back just as fast.  While looking for the first one a second one came in just like it and followed a very similar pattern.  The objects appeared like a sphere but the light or glow around it was similar to an upside down top.;34.4829;-79.3491
