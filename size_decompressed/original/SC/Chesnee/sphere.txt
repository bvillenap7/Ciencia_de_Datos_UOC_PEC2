Sphere like object with lights dropped 2 smaller ones and vanished.;2019-07-10 21:35:00;1 minute;Sphere like object with lights dropped 2 smaller ones and vanished My 2 Kids - ages 14 and 9 were laying by pool reading and swimming in pool back and fourth - at dark the kids put the books down and began swimming continuously with no lights, in the country, pitch black... come out to check from doing laundry and they were fine went back in and 5 min later they come running inside saying they saw a round sphere like shape that just appeared over the house that was hovering.. with numerous lights all over it - that they were stars at first but began looking harder and noticed it was on an aircraft of some sort - they also reported dark red lights on it..  they said that it dropped two smaller versions of itself and they went two opposite directions and they began to get really scared and ran inside..   I ran outside and nothing was there.  They said it didn’t make any noises.  When I told them I didn’t believe them that it isn’t a joke they started to get really upset and swore on it.  I believe it - wish I could have seen it.;35.1144;-81.8708000000001
