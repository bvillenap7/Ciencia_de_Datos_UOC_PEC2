It was the middle of the day, and the sun was to the right of it. At first I thought it was an rainbow trying toform because of the orange color that reflected off of it, or maybe I had looked into the sun and messed up my vision, but then I saw a shadow underneath it, and It ddid not move, just hovered. I could then see that it was not a rainbow trying to form, but the sun was reflecting off of it. It was like something in stealth mode, but because of the clouds behind it, I could see it because clouds seemed to disappear behind it. It had like a clear and orange tint from where it faced the sun.;35.1144;-81.8708000000001
