UFO sighted on 1/25/07;2007-01-25 22:55:00;4 minutes;UFO sighted on 1/25/07 I heard of sightings that occurred on the night of 1/24/07 in the general area of SC and NC.  At 10:55pm on 1/25/07 I went to take my dogs outside before bed and noticed a bright light (not flashing) and relatively close to the ground staying in one location.   My first thought was that it was a plane, but that quickly faded the more I looked at it.  It was not moving, just sitting still in the air.  I could see traces of light or smoke (looked kind of like what sparklers do when you light them and swing them around) and it was a bluish color.  I watched the object for the entire period.  It all of a sudden went slowly higher and the light became a small dot in the sky, and then proceeded to fly out of sight.  I know that it was indeed not a plane because I have a hot tub outside and have seen many planes fly over at night, and this was totally different.  There were no flashing lights on this object at all and a plane can't sit still in the air and then go higher at the same location, and then take off (atleast not to my knowledge).;35.1144;-81.8708000000001
