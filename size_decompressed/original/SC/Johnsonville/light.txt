It was low overcast with clouds, no stars or the moon were visible. I was walking west when I noticed a bright gold glowing round object hovering motionless. It was much lower than plains fly.  At first I thought it was a flare but there were no movement, sparks, smoke, sound or  vapor trail. It sat there motionless for a few seconds then a second one appeared in front of it.  The same color and size.  They were both motionless.  A few seconds later a third one appeared in front of them, all three were motionless, still no sparks, smoke, sound or vapor trail.  They sit motionless for a few seconds then started to slowly move toward the east, still no sound, sparks, smoke or vapor trail. At once all three vanished.  There were no visible signs that anything had been there. The lights were visible for maybe a minute.  I could not see any planes in the area.;33.8272;-79.4787

Originally, I thought it was only a star, but it moved to the left, went behind a tree, but came back to the first place I saw it.  Then I thought maybe an airplane.  But stopped for a few seconds, then went straight up and stopped again.  I called my son to come outside and jokingly said, Do you wanna see a UFO?  So I pointed it to him then it got weird.  The thing started moving in circles, started zig zagging changing directions in a flash, all while very slowly getting higher.   It is now over 4 hrs later, and while much higher we are still it at 1:46 am eastern on 10/15/2015.;33.8272;-79.4787
