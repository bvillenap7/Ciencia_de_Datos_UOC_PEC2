A linear pattern of 12 reddish lights moving to the South.;2014-01-15 20:00:00;3 minutes;A linear pattern of 12 reddish lights moving to the South At around 8:00 pm, I arrived back at my house after making a brief store trip.  As I was pulling into my driveway I looked in the southwestern sky and noticed what appeared to be two versions of the planet Mars low in the horizon directly over the tree line.  At first I thought they were planets or stars but their color and proximity to one another was noticeably odd.  I exited my vehicle and as I watching the objects another light appeared directly beside them.  Then another, while the additional lights were appearing I noticed the lights were moving in a linear pattern to the South.  As I noticed the pattern and direction of the lights I went inside and had my wife come outside to see the lights.  By this time there were at least eight reddish colored lights in a linear pattern moving in the same direction.  The formation appeared to be evenly spaced and remained linear.  I estimate there were twelve lights before they disappeared out of view.  They did not! disappear all at once, it was more like a passing object with the first lights leaving our line of sight due to their low appearance in the sky and the topography of the land.  As the sighting came to an end I thought I noticed a shape to a craft, almost as if the lights belonged to one large object.  However, I am not certain that this was the case.;34.6215;-82.5146000000002
