On my way home from work as I topped a hill 2 miles from my house I noticed a triangle shaped object above the tree line.When I got to where I could get a good look I slowed my car to a stop and rolled my window down.When I looked up I absolutly could not believe what I was seeing.About 20ft. from the road at around 150ft. up a trianguler craft was hovering.The craft was over a pond and didn't make any sound and I couldn't see any lights.I would gess that it was around 30ft.wide and 8ft.tall.I could see 4 tanks along what I guess would be the rear of the craft.I could also see tiles on the bottom of the craft.I went home an told my wife and kids what I had just seen.They wanted to see it, so we grabed the camera and camcorder.But when we got there it was gone.;34.6215;-82.5146000000002
