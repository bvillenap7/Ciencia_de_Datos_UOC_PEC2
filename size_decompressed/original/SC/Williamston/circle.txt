Ball of orange light over main street Williamston.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-25 22:35:00;5 minutes;Ball of orange light over main street Williamston. On my way home, I saw a ball of orange light in a starless night, traveling across the sky at a high speed.  It seemed low for a normal aircraft and no pulse lights.  The only light was the bright orange glow.  After around five minutes of watching the unknown craft, it vanished over the tree line.   I seen it directly over main street.
