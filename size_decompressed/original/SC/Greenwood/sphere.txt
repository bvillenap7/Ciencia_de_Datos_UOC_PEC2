Bright red sphere floating and completely silent takes off and disappears.;1995-01-01 15:00:00;20 seconds;Bright red sphere floating and completely silent takes off and disappears. I don't remember the exact date or even the year.  I know it was in the 90s and I was In Junior high school.   I was in my yard about to cross the street to go to a neighbors house when I saw a bright reddish sphere with an orange tint.  It was floating over my friends house and completely still.  It did not seem far away and did not make a sound.   I stopped dead in my tracks staring at it trying to figure out what it was.  I was in shock.  Before I had the chance to do anything else it took off to the left in a perfect line so fast and disappeared.   It was the weirdest thing I've seen in my life.  It wasn't a weather balloon or any other thing like that.  It was different.   I never told anyone because I did not want to be made fun of.  Recently I told my husband and he thinks I'm nuts.   But after reading other peoples descriptions of what they saw it sounds like I am not the only one. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two shiney spheres spotted in sky following airplane;2009-02-07 16:45:00;About 8 Minutes;Two shiney spheres spotted in sky following airplane I was walking back to my house after checking the mail and noticed a plane flying overhead.  Just behind the plane a little was what looked like a small round shiney object that followed in the same direction of the plane for a little while but at a slower pace.  It slowed almost imperceptibly to a complete stop, then began moving north-east and it was at that time that I noticed a second object come in to view behind the first and they both sat their for some time before fading out of sight..;34.2075326732674;-82.159886138614
