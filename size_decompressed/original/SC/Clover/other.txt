Maneuvering arrangment of lights.;2014-04-14 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;maneuvering arrangment of lights My buddy and I were in the back yard when we saw a arrangement of lights in the distance seemingly appeared from nothing.  I put other under craft shape because all we could see was a line of lights but I felt like there was more to the object that we couldn't see.  The object didn't move that quickly but made turns and maneuvers that didn’t seem to be possible from conventional aircraft.  After a moment or two it was gone but we saw it again after a few minutes passed.  I have never considered myself much of a “believer” and I don’t know what I saw but I saw something.;35.1046;-81.2168000000001
