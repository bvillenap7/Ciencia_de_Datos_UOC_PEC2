I was looking up in a WNW direction. I heard other reports of strange lights seen by others, not only on the Art Bell show but a radio station in Delaware on the East coast was taking reports on the air when I tuned in at 5:30 am. I was star gazing with my husband on Wednesday evening Sept 01 1999. We went outside at about 9:20pm with our night vision scope and binoculars-it was a clear night. I was facing WNW and observed with the unaided eye (except for my eyeglasses) a couple of shooting stars.  I thought it was strange to be seeing them, because the next meteor shower that I know of won't be untill Nov.17th. Then at around 9:30pm from the same direction, I then saw what I described to my husband as 'a white light that looked like it exploded'.  It was a quick burst of light and then it was gone...like a pinpoint of light that burst out and got bigger.  It did not light up the whole sky, just a small diameter about the size of my pinky. I thought it was strange, but it could have just been a meteorite that entered in at about a 45 degree angle and exploded--untill I tuned into Art Bell's show and heard about all these people calling in about the lights they were seeing at about 9:30 coming in from the west. I couldn't believe it! I wondered if this was just a coincidence, because no one was reporting anything happening on the east coast...Not yet. Since Art Bell goes off the air at 5am in my area, I decided to tune in via the internet and picked call letters WGMD which is in Delaware. Art was supposed to be on that station till 6, but for some reason he wasn't. But when the host returned after commercials it was someone else's voice saying that people are calling in to ask if anyone else was seeing strange lights in the sky. I continued to listen for about a half hour as they were airing phone calls from the ones who observed them in the Delaware area. Obviously something country-wide or even bi-coastal was happening that night into the morning...not just on the west coast.;35.1046;-81.2168000000001
