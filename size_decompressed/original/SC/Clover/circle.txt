Large circular flying object that appeared to be on fire.;2011-08-21 20:45:00;2-3 minutes;Large circular flying object that appeared to be on fire. After picking up our son from practice we were preparing to turn onto the highway.  It was approximately 8:45 PM.  As we were waiting for on-coming traffic to clear I noticed something strange very high in the sky and directly in front of us. My son and husband noticed it also. At first I thought that possibly an airplane had been struck by lightning.  Then we realized that it was much too high in the sky and moving way to slow to be an airplane.  There were no flashing lights, and no sound that we could hear. It appeared to be circular in shape, but had the appearance of being on fire.  A bright orange fireball is the best way I can describe it.  It also looked abnormally large for how far up in altitude it had to have been. The object moved in a straight line for approximately 2 minutes.  During this time it maintained a uniform speed, size, and glowing orange.  Abruptly it turned west (a 90 degree turn) and almost immediately became a tiny pin-point of light.  Then it was gone.;35.1046;-81.2168000000001
