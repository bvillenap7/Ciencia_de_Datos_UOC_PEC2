Bright boomerang shaped object caused corneal burns;2018-12-26 02:35:00;5 seconds;Bright boomerang shaped object caused corneal burns Very bright boomerang shaped object right above tree level moving very fast.  It was about 30 feet long.  I saw while waiting at the light on 557.  After it passed, my vision was very blurry and I would up with minor corneal burns.   I'm not sure what this was, but it was so close to the ground, it could not be a shooting star.;35.1046;-81.2168000000001
