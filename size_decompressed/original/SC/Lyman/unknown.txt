Star that moved up and down and side to side.;2018-01-06 19:30:00;1 hour;star that moved up and down and side to side Was at my daughters in a rural area so not much light interference. I went outside to have cig.  For the past 40 plus yrs I've been a star gazer and always look at the night sky, it is dark at her house so I can really see the stars, I was looking to the NW at about 30 degrees and thought it was a star and kept looking at it trying to determine what star / planet it might be.  (Orion was behind me in SE at about 70 degrees )  It just looked like a star but then it started making slight movements, up and down, side to side and little loop-de-loops I watched for about 10 min. and thought my eyes where playing tricks so I called my son-in-law out to see if he saw the same thing.  Yes, he did!  We both continued to watch the movements for at least another 30 min.  Tried to video it but was to dark out to capture anything. I have no idea how far away it was or how many miles above the earth it was, so what seemed like slight movements to us, may well have been huge maneuvers. We were finally driven inside frozen by the cold.;34.9689;-82.1480000000001
