Bright white light over the ocean.;2018-06-24 00:00:00;10 minutes;Bright white light over the ocean. Over the ocean, initially saw a flashing light that split into three distinct objects before quickly coming back to the apex.  We continued watching as the light blinked across the sky for 4-7 minutes before emitting a brilliant white light.  The light was so bright I looked away, but when looked back the night was still and there were no lights in the sky aside from the stars.;32.552;-80.3068
