At first look, it appeared as a brightly lit planet (Jupiter) during ideal viewing conditions. It was rather large (very noticeable) and it resembled the brightness of a planet but the sky wasn’t quite dark enough to see such brightness from a planet and its location ruled out the possibility for it to be a planet. I grabbed my binoculars and was astonished to see upon focusing, that the single bright light I saw actually appeared as 4 large yellow lights with flashing red lights in between.  It remained stationary as I observed and then the lights changed to a vertical or north south position and the flashing red lights disappeared while the four yellow lights I had initially seen changed to 5 or 6 solid yellow lights (I was unable to confirm 5 or 6 because it start! ed moving off to the right in this position and faded out of my view.) No sound could be heard (such that would be associated with an airplane.) Reflecting back, the whole viewing lasted (given that I had time to get up and take my binoculars from their case and adjust them) about 2-3minutes. I am a college educated healthcare professional (nurse) and my husband, a physician, witnessed this with me while having dinner on the porch.;32.552;-80.3068
