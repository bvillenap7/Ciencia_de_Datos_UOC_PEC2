Orange glowing Orb off Edisto Island.;2019-09-21 22:30:00;10 minutes;Orange glowing Orb off Edisto Island. Light was observed on Edisto Island off the coast of SC.  I was traveling south to north and was roughly100-200 ft in the air.  It would travel north then circle out to the west and then reappear further south and perform the same pattern, slowly and methodically getting further from view.  It seemed to have only one forward facing light as when I made its turn, the light faded away.;32.552;-80.3068
