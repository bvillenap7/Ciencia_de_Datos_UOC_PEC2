Saw small cone shaped object near Fort Jackson army base.;1998-01-16 17:00:00;40 seconds;Saw small cone shaped object near Fort Jackson army base. My neighboor and I were driving home from the RC Aircraft Field, at fort jackson. We were approimately 5 miles on interstate I-20 (west bound) out of fort jackson looking toward the city of Columbia. I noticed an object in the air that I could not identify. (I am a licensed Pilot) I attempted to look at it further to identify the object as I do often to practice (scanning technique) for flying. The object was cone shaped with what looked like a flare on the top 1/5 of the object. Silverer in color and seemed to be vibrating (car was stable so this was ruled out)Car = Nissan Maxima. It was also near dust so an aircraft should have had it's lights on. I do know there was helicopter activity in the fort jackson area due to an over flight of an apache attack helicopter earily at the RC Field (gave us a little scare). But this object did not look like a helicopter. The object did not appear to have any kind of velocity. We passed the object, it was on the drivers side I was in the passenger seat, I leaned over to see the object from the back seats and it was gone. The other witness is a RC Pilot and grew up with airplanes his father was a light bird in the army who flies to this day. I am sepectical of this object, I am thinking about calling columbia's approach control and asking them if they had anything on radar for that area.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
