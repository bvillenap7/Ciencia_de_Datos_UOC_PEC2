I have strange dreams of  very hightech information  thats ruining my life. While driving to a meeting in Florence S.C. I happened to look to my left to the north  when I noticed a faint red object slowly moving over the treetops. I noticed the at equal segments there would be small flashes of lightning like light coming from the bottom of craft. I could not believe what I was seeing. I stopped my jeep on the side of the highway and got out of the jeep to get a better look. At this point I still could not believe it. I reached into the jeep and got my handheld floodlight and plugged it in the lighter I pointed it at the object and flashed it a couple of times at the craft and it stopped changed to a faint orange and it flashed three times and changed back to red . I flashed a few times more and the craft matched what I did. then the craft moved on heading west. So I got in the jeep crossed the median to follow it. All of a sudden it just took off straight up at super high speed. I stopped the jeep again got out to look all I could is several starlike objects moving in the western sky and they where gone. I could'nt believe no other cars drove by during this time. So I drove on to Florence. When I got there everyone was angry with me and I could not understand why. then they asked me why was I almost four hours late. All I told them was I had car trouble. For all these years I never told anyone until I found your website. This is not the first time. Ever since this time I have memories of strange incidents simular to this, going all the way to my childhood.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Moving single white light in sky that changed directions then halted until it faded from sight.;2013-02-09 06:35:00;10 minutes (?);Moving single white light in sky that changed directions then halted until it faded from sight. I was outside doing stretching with my Soldiers during physical training and was laying on my back.  I saw a single light moving across the sky.  It was near day break and could see only a single bright star in the sky.   At first it looked as if it was a satellite moving east however, it began slowing down and started to turn north and then halted and remained in that position for several minutes.  It was high enough where it was not a distinguishable craft but just a single bright light.   One of my buddies conducting the stretch with me also saw the same light.   It then became dimmer and dimmer as if it was moving up and away into the atmosphere until it could no longer be seen.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
