At the time, there were a few other cars around me. Something caught my eye to the west of me in the sky.  At first glance I thought it was firecrackers, but the objects moved directly towards the interstate. I notice that the objects were flying in a V-formation.  As the objects passed directly over me, they changed formation. I looked upwards and notice that there were about seven of the unidentified objects.  On the bottoms of the objects were stripes of red in which each stripe would appear brighter as a light alternates across each stripe.  I also noticed that the objects had a rotational spin as they continued to move toward the east. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
