A large circular craft with many different colored lights blinking around it (like they were windows or lights on the craft).;1978-06-01 21:00:00;15min;A large circular craft with many different colored lights blinking around it (like they were windows or lights on the craft). The date is not acurate since I am reporting this from my childhood, about 22 years ago. On a clear night in the mid to late 70's, my brother and I observed a very large round strange craft with a rounded bottom and sharp circular edge and above that a row of various colored lights that seemed to light in circular fashion around the craft.  It had a smaller circular top.  We observed this object hovering over the tree line and were very disturbed by this since it was very different.  I don't remember what happened afterwards I think it slowly drifted away.  At the same time (not sure if it was the same day) I was walking up some stairs and observed 2-3 bright spheres out the window making a pass over our house.  NO sounds were ever made by any of these objects.  I have heard other reports that these spheres have been seen entering and/or leaving a large craft like the one I described before.  Any other reports of these incidents at the time? ((NUFORC Note:  Approximate date.  It is very difficult to report to a witness if anything similar was reported, unless an accurate time and date is known.  The time and date of an event are very important for comparison of possibly related events.  PD));34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Enormous Round Object with Lights in the Sky;2003-11-25 05:33:00;2-3 minutes, Not totally ;Enormous Round Object with Lights in the Sky I was driving on I-26 west heading North when I noticed what I thought at first was a strange reflection of lights in my windsheild. This had been going on for a few minutes when I became aware of it. I then looked up at the sky and there seemed to be lights behind the clouds, I thought maybe lightening. But the lights were not flashing and I could not see streaks or bolts. The lights seemed to be undulating(for lack of a better word) behind the clouds. I then became aware of a light and some movement in the corner of my left eye. When I looked I saw an enormous(huge!) round object with 2 sets of lights in a large and small circle (inside the large) on it. It appeared to spin slightly one way and then the other. I'm not sure if it was turning or if the lights were just blinking. The object was very close to the tree tops and was at a slight angle. I was in a total state of shock. And then I realized how close it was to me and that it seemed to be following along with me. I kind of panicked and turned off my radar detector, cell phone and radio. I realize now that this was silly. But I suddenly became scared. Then as suddenly as I noticed it , it was gone. I don't remember seeing it fly away or anything. I just remember it no longer being there. I may have just sped up and left it behind. There were no cars near me going North and I could see some heading my way on the other side of the interstate, but they were not close. It was strange because I forgot about it for about a half a day and then suddenly I remembered and told my daughter about it. I have been searching to see if anyone else saw this. It was so huge that I could not be the only one to see this! I was wide awake and had only been traveling about 2.5 hours.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Round metallic jellyfish-like craft with white blinking lights flies over car low & slow, Columbia, SC;2011-11-09 19:00:00;5 seconds;Round metallic jellyfish-like craft with white blinking lights flies over car low & slow, Columbia, SC I was driving West on Rt. I-26 and was near exit 104 (Piney Grove) when I saw what I thought was a low flying plane headed East, almost directly over the road but slightly South of the road.  It was dark outside and the craft had several white lights (4?) underneath that blinked on and off about every 1 or 1.5 seconds.  It was flying very low and slow and as it approached and flew overhead I looked up twice and saw that it was circular in shape. I thought perhaps it was foggy outside and that the glow from the lights made the craft appear circular (it had been very foggy on a prior night, but it actually was clear this night). I am not sure if it generated any sound as I had the radio on, but certainly there was no loud engine sound.  I wanted to turn around to follow the craft, but I had just passed an exit.  I thought it had the shape of a sort of metallic jellyfish but without any tendrils.   I could not locate any media accounts of this sighting, so maybe i! t was a plane after all.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Four circles of light spotted in the sky creating a 1 and 1/4 rotation before converging.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light?  PD));2015-02-20 21:30:00;1 hour;Four circles of light spottwd in the sky creating a 1 and 1/4 rotation before converging on a central point. Tonight at around 9:30 my mother called for me on the porch, she stated that there were some strange lights.  Naturally I went out and there in the sky was 4 circles of light. They seemed to very carefully and precisely make a 1 and 1/4 loop before converging into a single mass at their center.  This behaviour continued for an hour or so before they just vanished.  At first we assumed that it had been spotlights but after investigation found no evidence of an origin for the lights on the ground. Even more shockingly after this incident I sent my footage to a friend who lives about 6 miles from me.  He in turn went outside and recorded the exact same light pattern I had.   Neither of us could figure out what was causing this as no origin could be seen coming from the ground. Both me and my friend are juniors in high-school.  I myself am color-blind to a degree.  I have never been one to jump to calling something a UFO but what I saw tonight was not normal at all. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness was observing a rotating advertising light.

Then noticed 3 small objects.;2017-08-13 20:30:00;2 hours;I was watching Perseid meteor shower, when I noticed random flashes of light that appeared to be far off.  Then I noticed 3 small objects pulsing and moving slowly towards the moonrise.  The objects re positioned themselves several times.   Then in the area of the random flashes, I saw a solid orange small orb emit a beam towards one of the pulsing objects.   I watched the small orbs moving very slowly for over an hour, until i went inside for the night.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Large bright green ball with red tail crossed W to E very high up in pre-dawn above res. area for 5-6 seconds.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-04 06:55:00;6 seconds;Large bright green ball with red tail crossed west to east in very high up in pre-dawn above residential area for 5-6 seconds. Near the end of my pre-dawn walk, I saw high in the sky a bright green ball with a diminishing sparkly red tail move west to east and disappear behind silhouetted large trees.  The sight was astonishing!   I quickly moved across the road to follow it, but I lost it.  This happened just before sunup while the sky was not bright yet.   I have never seen this and at first tried to consider a plane, but the green ball was too large and planes do not have red tails.  The tail was not very long, but was definitely in a pennant configuration.  Comet? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
