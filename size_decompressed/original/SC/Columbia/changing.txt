White objects at high altitude and high speeds during clear daytime conditions.;2005-01-01 13:45:00;5 minutes;White objects at high altitude and high speeds during clear daytime conditions. Saw UFOs while grilling on deck. Noticed them while watching airliner depart local area to the north. Saw three of them and thought at first that they were high-flying seagulls or other birds. But as the airliner flew by them they suddenly took off toward the southwest in formationn---and at a hight rate of speed. Then they separated from the formation, flew apart for a while, then resumed close formation and disappeared beyond the horizon. Changes of speed and direction were unusually abrupt. I am a former USAF pilot and can say I never saw anything like this before.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536

Round changing shape UFO with multiple fins spotted flying over Columbia South Carolina near forest acres.;2014-02-19 15:17:00;45 seconds;Round Changing shape UFO with multiple fins spotted flying over Columbia South Carolina near forest acres I was sitting in my back yard looking at the sky.  I was smoking a cig and sitting in a chair. I leaned my head back and looked up at the sky.  Around a minute or so later I saw a spherically shaped object.  It was probably 800 to 900 feet up it was tiny a little smaller than a fighter jet. from what I could tell.  The object had around 5 to six small looking fins projecting out from the front of the craft sides and back of the craft with faint blue lights flickering.  The spherical shape started to change shape form sphere to a pill shaped with the fins staying in tact.  The object was moving fast from the north west to south east.  The object stopped for a short second then accelerated very fast in the same direction it was heading.  No jet trail was left and even from the ground it was obvious it was not a bird or a plane.  The object made no sound what so ever.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
