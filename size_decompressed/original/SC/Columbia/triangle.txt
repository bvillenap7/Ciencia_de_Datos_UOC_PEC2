My wife and I went onto the patio to smoke.  We were seated facing due East towards Ft. Jackson.  Normally there is frequent air traffic overhead as there is an airport 5 miles South West of us. I saw what I first supposed to be running lights of an approaching aircraft, except they were not as bright as usual...Very dim by comparison. As the object got closer, I noticed it was traveling quite fast faster than an approaching aircraft usually goes, a vaguely bulbous triangular outline was visible from the ground light. I called my wifeâ€™s attention to it, and she remarked that it was odd and resembled a parachute. My best guess is that the object was at an altitude of roughly 1500 ft. away from us at about 60 degrees above the horizon... neither my wife nor I heard a sound from the object.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Massive triangle in skies above Columbia, SC;2019-07-02 22:25:00;4 minutes;Massive Triangle in skies above Columbia, SC A massive triangle shaped object moved slowly across the night sky at what appeared to be 7500 feet in altitude.  There was no jet engine sound.  Red blinking lights were in synchronized and equidistant in distance.  Total area of object at a guess would have been around the size of a city block.  The weather was clear and Venus was clearly visible.  Object was flying NE to SW.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
