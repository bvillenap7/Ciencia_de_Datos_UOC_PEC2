Nearly stationary teardrop shaped with short contrail over Richland County;2010-10-22 15:10:00;15 - 20 minutes;Nearly stationary teardrop shaped with short contrail over Richland County At approximately 3:00 in the afternoon, my adult daughter and her husband phoned me at work from another part of town to tell me they were watching an unidentified tear-drop shaped object in the south-western sky and they wanted to know if I had heard about anything that it could be. I went into a co-worker's office with a south-facing window and we both observed the object which appeared to be at least a couple of miles into the sky, over in the direction of the southern-most part of Richland County. The object didn't look tear-shaped from our angle, however, it was more like a very short contrail, the way you would think a meteor would look, however, it wasn't moving enough to be an airplane. It just stayed there, adn eventually got smaller and disappeared. I went back to my office and phoned my daughter and she said they watched the object until it disappeared as well. They tried to video tape it but it wasn't showing up on their phone camera.  Our local t! elevision station said no one has called anything in.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
