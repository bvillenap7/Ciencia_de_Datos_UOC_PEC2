Weird Experience with Men in Black maybe?;2014-05-01 19:00:00;~20 minutes;Weird Experience with Men in Black maybe? 	On May 1st, 2014, I was confronted with a threat by a unnamed individual on the internet.  I have always have had a interest in UFOs and Area 51 and other stuff.  Never thought anything serious of it until May 1st. 	I came home from a day at school and I thought I’d look at some sightings and go into chat rooms about UFOs like I usually would do on a normal day.  I looked at sightings for about an hour, got bored, and moved on to talk to others who are interested in UFOs.  Usually I get a lot of pranks and people who are just trying to joke, but every now and then I receive a legit person who shares info with me. 	On May 1st, I encountered a man who was very interested in UFOs and had a lot of information that most people never shared or even had opinions about. 	He said things like there are these “people” who try to quiet him and he refuses and is spreading the word that he has “come in contact with a UFO”, and never had a chance to grab his camera, but he could describe it like he was there. 	He started to explain the object to me, he said it had blinding, bright lights and moved in incredible different ways. Before he could go further, my computer glitched, but I was still in the chat, however, he had stopped typing. I thought it was just bad connection but then a stranger came in the room and these exact words appeared on my screen, “Do not speak of what this man said. This conversation didn’t happen.”   It seemed like a threat, I thought it was some dumb prank, but then, all my tabs and links I had pulled up were immediately shut down. 	I do not know what became of this man but ever since that day, I have no doubt in my mind someone or something didn't want me to know about the object this man had seen.  Since then, I've been looking for a place to share my story.  All I know is whatever he saw, it must of been something that we were not supposed to know about.   I have know idea why he chose a live chat to tell me this, and I have know idea if anyone else knows, but this is my experience.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
