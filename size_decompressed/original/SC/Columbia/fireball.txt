I saw a flaming object falling from the sky at a tremendous rate of speed.;2001-12-03 20:00:00;3 seconds;I saw a flaming object falling from the sky at a tremendous rate of speed. I was driving down Gervaise Street, approaching Millwood Avenue, and heading, I would guess, in a northerly or north-easterly direction.  Suddenly, I saw a flaming object falling out of the sky at a tremendous rate of speed.  I would guess that it fell at about a 30 degree angle.  I lost sight of it when it fell below the tree line.  I screamed and prepared for an explosion, but there was none.  I have no idea what I saw, but I thought it was an aircraft in flames.  Just seconds after that, I heard sirens and thought emergency vehicles were on the way to the site.  They passed me and turned up another street.  I followed them, but they went to the scene of an auto accident. I found out later that there would be a meteor shower 7-10 days after the sighting and wondered if this could have been an early arrival.  My 7-year old son was with me and saw it also.  I am a college graduate and fairly intelligent.  I am pretty logical and have never witnessed anything like this before.  If it was a meteor, it was extremely close to the ground.  As I said, I really expected to see an explosion when it hit the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Red fireball UFOs over South Carolina in controlled flight  to a northerly direction seen south of Columbia;2009-03-28 11:45:00;4 minutes;Red fireball UFOs over South Carolina in controlled flight to a northerly direction seen south of Columbia On the night of March 28, 2009 I was driving on I26 going west, just south of Columbia, South Carolina.  I had just spent an hour at a roadside rest area and slept for an hour before continuing on my trip.  Not long after continuing my drive, suddenly I saw what looked like a circular shaped glowing ball of fire. About the size of a Frisbee it flew in toward me out of the western sky. In the total darkness, I could not judge how high up it was. I marveled at it as it flew directly overhead and followed it threw my sun roof.  I did not think of it as a UFO because I kept thinking about how this thing resembled a bright red and orange amber in a fire.  The inside of the circle sparkled with white flashes as the orange color graduated to a cooler red at the perimeter.  The outside of the circle was not well defined and wavered slightly. I did not think of it as a UFO because I had a preconception, from what I so often have heard, that UFOs are glowing white lights in the sky at night.  I also never really believed that there were such things as UFOs. As fast as I could, I crossed over two lanes on the interstate, stopped on the side, opened the sun roof, and stuck my head out to continue looking at this fireball.  To my surprise I saw yet another similar object approaching from the east on a collision course with the first. When they were relatively close to each other, they both made sharp turns to the north.  They continued flying in formation until they disappeared in the horizon.  I was driving a hybrid car so the car engine was completely silent and no traffic was on the highway at this moment. Yet I could not detect any noise from these objects in the sky.  I have seen thousands of aircraft in the sky and live near an airport, so there is no mistaking these items for airplanes. Shortly after these items had disappeared into the horizon, I witnessed what I thought at first was a shooting star. However, as I thought about it, it dawned on me that this could not have been a coincident. This beam of light, coming from space, intersected the pathway of the two flying objects. It appeared to me that if this beam of light had appeared ten, fifteens seconds earlier, it would have been right on top of these objects or even possibly hit one of them. It is also worth noting that these UFOs were in this geographic location on the same day that the shuttle landed at Cape Kennedy.  The shuttle landed at 3:14 pm and this sighting occurred at 11:45 pm. I realize that these occurrences are many hours apart, but never the less it is on the same day and only a few hundred miles apart.

UFO bright like the North Star no doubt about what I saw.;2015-04-22 21:30:00;30 seconds;UFO bright like the North Star no doubt about what I saw. Sitting on my back deck, I look at the stars and aircraft from the airport every night.  I've seen satellites and shooting stars on occasion but tonight I noticed something that I could not make out.   It was lower than any plane from the airport would fly near the city and had no flashing lights no sound.  It was so bright it was like the North Star.   It was gliding and begin to gain speed at a high rate.  And suddenly, it started going vertical and went straight up into space until the light faded.   It was so clear it was unbelievable what I saw next. It came back down barely in sight and took off towards the east.  The sky was clear no clouds.   I've been in the military for over 17 years and I can say without a doubt that this was not from Earth.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Soundless oval fireball - first still, then moving rapidly over Southeast Columbia, SC.;2015-06-20 21:40:00;20-30 seconds;Soundless Oval fireball - first still, then moving rapidly over Southeast Columbia, SC. On the night of June 20, around 9:40pm, I was walking home with my son when I believe I witnessed a UFO.   As we were walking, I saw what appeared to be an oval fireball to the east.  It appeared to be very close but I did not hear any sound.  It also did not appear to be moving.   After 5-10 seconds of looking at it, I pulled out my phone to make a video.  After a few seconds of video with my son and I walking toward the object, it appeared to move away at a rapid speed.  The video ends when the object disappears under the tree line. I will be emailing that video to the address given.  Subject june 20 Columbia South Carolina.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536

Very bright white ball of light, followed by a helicopter.;2017-10-18 22:00:00;3 seconds;Very bright white ball of light, followed by a helicopter. I'm not sure if this was actually a UFO sighting, when we all first saw it we assumed it was a shooting star.  After a couple minutes went by I was thinking about other shooting stars I have seen and thought this looked a bit different. The closest I can describe it as is being a very bright white, like an LED light, with a slight tint of blue.  It was almost shooting out sparks along the outside of the circle kind of like a giant sparkler.  Behind the light were bits of a dull red, similar to a bit of smoldering ash.  I felt like it was diving down instead of going straight across the sky like you would see with a shooting star. About 10 minutes later me and my wife left.  I was talking to her a little bit about it and she had similar thoughts about what we saw.  While we were discussing this we heard a helicopter in the sky that sounded like it was heading in the direction that this light was traveling.  We were unable to see it.  We were out in the suburbs and far from any kind of airport.  The fact that we heard a helicopter, in the same area, seemed weird and made me think that we saw something other that just a shooting star.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
