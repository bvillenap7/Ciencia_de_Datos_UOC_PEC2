Star-like object reported in Natchitoches, LA seen previously in South Carolina;2001-09-25 21:00:00;15 seconds;Star-like object reported in Natchitoches, LA seen previously in South Carolina Sorry I do not have an exact date and time for this, but I was not aware of NUFORC at the time this happened.  I would not have reported this at all if I had not read the sighting posted recently from Natchitoches, Louisiana on 1/24/03.  I too have seen a star-like object in the eastern sky that suddenly begins to move toward the north. I was standing on the deck behind my house about 9PM during the autumn of 2001 waiting for my dogs to come inside.  I was looking at the eastern sky at a group of three stars when one of them started moving in a straight line toward the north.  Considering the distance away of this object, it had to be moving quite fast but showed no signs of acceleration, that is, it did not start moving slowly and pick up speed.  After approximately 10-15 seconds the object simply disappeared as though its light had been turned off. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Driving on the highway and saw something fall out of the sky.;2009-12-29 20:30:00;5 secs;Driving on the highway and saw something fall out of the sky. I was driving northbound on 77 above Columbia, SC and off to my right I saw a rounded shape light falling almost straight down.  The lights were both white and red.  To me, it looked like a bullet without its casing.  It was falling really quick.  There were trees blocking its trajectory. So, it may have hit the ground.  There was no explosion of any kind, no fire, no sound, no smoke. It all happened in just a few seconds.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536

We have never seen anything move that fast. like seconds from the ground up.  The light was wide, no beam from and ground light.  There was a stream of light from the ground and then it was gone.

Within;2011-05-11 21:40:00;10 minutes;Yesterday, 11 May 2011,  I noticed a white circle in the sky above my neighbor’s trees at the same time I heard a plan engine.   Within a couple seconds the object dropped down to about 20 feet above the ground.  Then it proceeded to flash and fly in the field behind my house.  It also went across my neighbor’s fence, and back into the trees.  It seemed like it was taking it’s time in the field when it was flying.  I only noticed an orange/or red light. I have seen this three times this week the 11, 10, and 9th of this month.  The first time I witnessed it was in my fence it flashed lights in the trees.  I got scared and went in the house. On the 10th of May 2011 I saw it about 15-20 acres away in the field about 20 feet above the ground within two seconds it crossed the 15-20 acres and was at the corner of my fence.  It moved about 20 feet and flashed in my trees.  A second after that it was two houses down from me in the trees and flashed every second the light on it was a yellow/white. I will try to capture these UFO’s tonight again.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Glowy orange lights on Cayce side of the river.;2011-08-27 01:30:00;30 min;Glowy orange lights on Cayce side of the river. I saw two orange glowy lights moving slowly around the Cacye side of the river.  One was about twice the size of Venus while the other was three to four times as big.  Only watched for a few minutes but about 30 min. later engaged two other witnesses who told me they had just seen 5 of them.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Mulitiple sightings of the same UFO.;2011-10-15 19:00:00;0:03:00;Mulitiple sightings of the same UFO. My friend and I were sitting outside in my driveway around twilight.  We then saw what looked like a moving star coming from the north, but we didn't really recognize it as a UFO and disregarded it.  We then saw it again coming from the west and then thought it was an airplane coming in to land, so once again we diregarded it.  Next my friend, brother, and I went for a walk around 19:30-20:00. We noticed it again coming from north.  We kidded about it for a second with my brother saying we were wizards and moving the star, but then we realized it was abnormal. It wasn't a plane.  It had no blinking lights, no sound, moved swiftly, and looked like a star.  We stood and watched for about 3-4 minutes in shock. It started to get brighter and then suddenly began to shrink and turn into a light tint of red.  Then it just disappeared into nothing but the black sky.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Very bright light passing overhead at observational speed;2012-06-06 22:15:00;20 seconds;Very bright light passing overhead at observational speed At approximately 10:15pm I went to retrieve my trash can and was prompted to look-up to the sky, instinctively.  I immediately saw a very bright and fairly large light without sound slowly flying over my home at low altitude, heading due North.  I could estimate its low altitude, as an airplane was passing in the background at a much further distance and higher altitude, from a diagonal perspective.  The airplane had the standard pulsating lights. The vessel was coasting at observational speed.   As a student pilot, I conclude that it was not an airplane, as no flashing lights were active and neither the red or green orientation lights were apparent, as is featured on most aircraft wing tips.

Verified by multiple neighbors asked to come look the sky. Looking west from NE Columbia.  Started high in the sky within 15 min it has sunk much lower.  It is ongoing.  Moving to much to be a star, not enough for a helicopter.  However, the brightness can be compared to looking at a helicopter search light head on a few miles away.

Saw two bright white lights in the sky completely still;2016-10-12 07:25:00;1 minute;Saw two bright white lights in the sky completely still I was driving to school, and on my way to the gas station, I saw 2 craft.  It was completely clear accept for some small clouds (blue skies pretty much).   These white lights were very bright and white, too much for an airplane, and it was completely still I saw no chassis to a plane in the clear sky, i walked out of the gas station and saw that it had disappeared. so i'm guessing this phenomenon was a possible sighting and I think that's pretty cool.

Orange orb-shaped light arcing across the sky towards horizon at high speed.;2016-10-31 00:25:00;~1-2 seconds;Orange orb-shaped light arcing across the sky towards horizon at high speed I am a 17-year old male, currently done with high school, and am employed.  I am on two medications, ((deleted)) and ((deleted)), which are used to treat ((deleted)).  These medications have not caused hallucinations during the 2+ years I have been taking them.  This is my first sighting of something like this, although I've read very much about UFOs and seen many photos and videos of strange objects in the sky, but no videos I've seen match exactly what I saw. Very early this morning (Oct. 31 2016) I was sitting at my desk, which faces a window, while watching videos on my laptop.  Sitting at my desk and looking up, the sky takes up about 40% of my window, with my neighbor's house and yard toward the left side of the window taking up the other 60%. At about 12:25 AM (00:25), a sudden moving light in the sky caused me to be distracted from what I was doing and tilt my head to get a better view of the light, adding about 10% more of the sky to my view. The light was an orb/circle shape and was moving very fast, much faster than any plane I've seen in person, including military jets (at high altitudes).  It was bright orange in color. The orb was, from my perspective, about the size of a quarter.  I can't accurately estimate the altitude because the sky was dark at the time of the sighting. The orb flew into my view from the area of the sky to the right of my house and seemed to curve in a flattened, inverted U shape, like a ball being thrown, while moving away towards the horizon. The light disappeared after about 1 second of flight from where I saw it it could have been in flight longer but I can't be sure because I only saw it once it came into my view of the sky.   After 3 hours, I have seen no other lights.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
