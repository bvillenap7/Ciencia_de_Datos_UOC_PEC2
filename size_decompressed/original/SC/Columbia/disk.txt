Columbia, South Carolina 1974 Sighting.;1974-09-13 21:00:00;5 minutes;Columbia, South Carolina 1974 Sighting. I spent 12 years in the U.S. Army.  From 1973 to 1976 as an M.P. (Military Policeman) working undercover for the D.S.T. (Drug Suppression Team)  C.I.D. (Criminal Investigation Division) in Germany.  Basically, I traveled throughout Germany, wearing civilian clothes and pretending I was a former soldier that now resided in Germany dealing narcotics.  My codenames were Porkchops or Frisco, depending on what part of Germany I was at.  I went after what was known as the Khaki Mafia that originated in Vietnam.  The perpetrators recognized me, because I was known to wear a black trenchcoat, sunglasses, dark clothes and at the time I was sporting a beard and mustache.    But, before this excitement took place, I was in Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, in 1974 on a training exercise.  One night, two other soldiers and I were in Columbia, South Carolina, checking out the sights and we looked in the sky and saw 6 glowing blue discs in formation.   As we watched the UFOs dispersed in erratically zig zagging movements and disappeared quickly.  The first thing that came out of one soldier’s mouth was ‘geese?’  We looked at him and said ‘no way!’.   That was my first time experiencing a UFO encounter and it stayed with me for a long, long time.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536

It was at the height of a powerline, we could see it really cloae. The color was so bright and beautiful, we couldnt speak nor keep our eyes iff the object.  The energy from the object was very strong, as if it forced us into its world.   When the object reappeared it moved with such grace, nothing we ever seen before, no noise. If it eas an airplane it wouldnt be able to pick up the spped to gain altitude, it would have crashed without a proper landing location.  The object shot to the left and a bright red orange color appeared as it flew away over the nearby trees, and at that moment we were able to turn to one another and at that time we both said did you see that as if we were both unaware that the other party noticed the phenomena.! I dobt know if we will ever see this again, but what I do know now is that what others have seen is true and I too am now passionate about this all. I am a believer and I dont mind tellung the world. I AM NOT AFRAID....;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Saucer shape with red, yellow, green lights like lights on a ferris wheel at the stat fair.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD));2015-07-29 22:00:00;2 hours;saucer shape with red, yellow, green lights like lights on a ferris wheel at the stat fair To:  National UFO Reporting Center Subject: Reporting UFO sighting  last 4 days   	I have observed a saucer shaped UFO sitting in the same basic spot for three ot of the last four days.  Last night the cloud cover kept me from observing it.  The UFO is very high in the sky, I would guess about 4000 to 5000 feet, I am judging that distance because  a commercial airline flew fairly close to the UFO and it was about half the distance I  altitude than the UFO.  I do not have a camera to take a picture of it nor binoculars.  However, I have a rifle with a 50x scope and I can see the UFO clearly.  It must be very large disk, I would guess 100 to 200 feet in diameter. 	The UFO just hovers in one spot.  I have not seen it dart or move around any at all.  Through my scope I can see it continually bobble like a ship in the high seas.  It is very colorful like the rides at the state fair.  Red, green, yellow lights are flashing continuously. 	I would very much like to find  a local group of UFO watchers so that, I can contact them to send someone to my house with some recording equipment to take pictures or video. 	Please, inform me if you know of such a group.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
Extremely fast bullet shaped craft moving E-W no sound. Veteran observer.;2016-01-16 15:00:00;20 seconds;Extremely fast bullet shaped craft moving E-W no sound. Veteran observer. First off I have never reported a unidentified object.  I am 51 and been in aviation all my life.  Pilot both fixed wing/heli. 35+ yrs in rc aircraft and quadcopters for the last 10.   Bottom line is I have seen most every type of aircraft, civilian, military and remote controlled craft. Object was moving extremely fast E to W.  The refection of the sun is what got my attention. Sky conditions are severe clear,bright sun.  Object appeared shiny and possible pointed in the front.  Overall the classic bullet shape.  No wings or tail seen. Size and altitude are hard to judge but my estimate is either it was 5 thousand agl and the size of a fighter or fl 300 and airline sized.  The speed either way was very fast.  No sound.  None.  Had it been a fighter at that speed it would be Mach 1 + easily.  Tracked E- W until going out of view.  Hard to judge distance but best est is less than 5 miles away.  Again its alt and distance depends apon the size of the craft, which I cannot verify.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536

Metallic saucer floating and slightly shaking;2019-02-26 18:25:00;5 minutes;Metallic saucer floating and slightly shaking I was outside playing in my backyard and the sun was setting but it wasn't completely dark. When I opened my gate to go to my front yard.  About 100-150 feet was a saucer shaped object.  It was a metallic color and the hull of the craft looked a light different color.  The craft also had a cap on top of it.  It was standing still and was shaking a little bit. There was no sound and for about 2 minutes it stood there still.  I was in shock and I didn't even pull out my phone to record it because I couldn't believe my eyes.  There was a circle at the bottom of the craft that looked like it would lite up.  Then it tilted to the side and that's when I saw a part of the top of the craft.  Then it went upwards and diagonal west insanely fast.  That's when I knew that it wasn't an airplane because it seemed like it broke through the sky because it disappeared so fast. The aircraft looked about to be a little under 20 feet long and about 10-15 feet tall.  Metallic color and had three square things at the bottom of the craft.  Everything was metallic silver/metal color.  The top of the craft had this metal cap too. In between the three bottom square objects was a medium size circle, about 5 feet in diameter.  It looked like it would light up but it wasn't.  It looked like a white light that went out with a metallic hue over it.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
