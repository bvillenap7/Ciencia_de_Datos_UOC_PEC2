PD));2015-09-02 06:22:00;2 minutes;very scary thought it may have been a meteor but it was flying not falling had a huge boomerang shaped aura. The object was moving in a straight line no noise, it had a haze around it in the shape of a sideways boomerang and a thick contrail, it was not in a perfect straight line i saw two jets heading in the direction a few mins after seeing the object, the aura was huge i thought it was going to crash never seen anything like it.

BRIGHT light, east-facing, above I-20W;2016-01-25 18:35:00;2-3 minutes;BRIGHT light, east-facing, above I-20W Traveling west-bound on I-20, between mile markers 30-40.  Coming across the hill, a bright, white, light shown horizontally from a spherical object several hundred feet above the tree line and about a hundred feet behind a cell tower (I think it's a cell tower) that had a blinking red light.  The light was BRIGHT--several times brighter than oncoming headlights.   As I drove closer and under the object, the light was less bright which meant to me it was pointing horizontally, eastward toward Columbia.  I didn't see any propellers or blinking side lights, which I looked for carefully.  On the back of the object, there was a dim red light circle, but it was dim and barely visible.  The best I can describe it is like a ring of LEDs being around a spare tire on a jeep--except the lights seemed continuous and dim.  Because this was after sunset, I tried to locate a pole or suspension wires for the object (although there aren't any other objects at that height).  It didn't! move, and appeared to be perfectly still.;34.0409198830417;-80.9708038277536
