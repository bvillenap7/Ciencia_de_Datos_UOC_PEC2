Light in the sky;2010-11-13 20:30:00;2 min;Light in the sky My husband, I and my 11 year old son were outside grilling around 2000 - 2030 and I noticed that in the distance (the sky was dark, and clear of clouds or fog)   The figure looked like a plane at first or a bright star, but the lights were not blinking like other planes and as it got closer to us it stopped and ascended straight up in to the sky until it disappeared.   It was amazing to finally see some first person evidence of extraterestrial activity, awesome!;33.8561814814815;-81.2362555555555
