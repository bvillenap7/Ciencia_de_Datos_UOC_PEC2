2 Orange/Red Balls, Flying Low, No Sound;2012-01-05 18:30:00;4-5 minutes;2 Orange/Red Balls, Flying Low, No Sound Was watching TV and glanced out our front window and saw two unusually large bright lights outside our window. Went out on porch to investigate and saw 2 large orange/red  fireball-type lights in the sky.  One followed the other flying very slow â€“ almost hovering, about 1000 ft. above ground, but no further than a mile away at most. The objects made absolutely no noise at all. They were flying northeast, slowly turned east, and seemed to vanish fairly quickly.;33.8561814814815;-81.2362555555555
