Red light slipping effortlessly through sky.;2003-07-14 22:45:00;1 second;Red light slipping effortlessly through sky. My family had car trouble on their way to play bingo.  I went to pick them up and took them to bingo.  They said to come back at 10:30 to pick them up.  I arrived before 10:30 and just waited in the van.  I got out a couple of times to have a cigarette and walked around, but it was when I got back in the van and was just waiting that I saw something real different.  I was looking out the window at some trees across the street and pretty far away.  There was a space shaped like a U' between two treetops, and I saw a red sphere cross this open space between the trees.  I kept looking all over to see it some more, but couldn't or didn't.  Now it was unlike anything man made in that it slipped so effortlessly through the sky, and there was no sound.  Planes would be real sluggish compaired to this effortless slipping through the sky of this red light.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606

Have seen what I thought was 2 stars lined up for the past week.;2015-10-24 20:00:00;30 seconds;Have seen what I thought was 2 stars lined up for the past week so when I looked up just alittle bit ago I thought it was the same thing. I sat back in my chair in the back yard and just kept my eyes on sky when the 2 (what I thought were starts) went racing towards each other and raced off.  The one that was higher went below the orb on bottom and stopped and, not super fast but went to the east.  It was coming straight down then stop, then left.   The one on bottom just kept going up and has stopped way up in the sky and remains there still. I have no camera and my cell only shows black.  This was very cool.

Green orb over Ladson, SC.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-07 20:10:00;15-20 seconds;Green orb over Ladson Sc. Tuesday, March 7, 2017, at 8:10 PM, my wife and I were traveling in two separate cars SSW on Royal Rd in Summerville, SC.   She was about 200 yards behind me, when we both witnessed from our driver side windows a green glowing orb traveling 100 feet from the side of the road, and just above the tree tops moving in our direction.  The object was in view for about 15 to 20 seconds, before we lost sight of it because of the trees.   Based on my speed of 35 MPH I would say the object was moving about 45 to 50 MPH.  I looked for the orb when I came to the next clearing over the junk yard, but the object was not visible in any direction.  The object was silent, solid, glowing steady green, spherical, and moving with definite purpose.
