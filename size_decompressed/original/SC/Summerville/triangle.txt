Triangular ship with bright white lights and complex outer body.;1992-07-01 20:00:00;2 min;Triangular ship with bright white lights and complex outer body. I cannot remember my exact age but I will guess close to ten.  Perhaps younger.   I was playing in my room with my younger sister and wanted to suddenly glance out the window.  I lean out of the window and glance up to see a giant triangular space craft.  It was the shape of what appeared to be an equilateral triangle.  On each point was a bright round light.  The part that may sound weird, is that it looked similar to that of the Borg ship in Star Trek.   The outside of it looked like that but in a triangular shape. It hovered low and silently.  It was moving from my left to right.  I can only guess North West.   I was able to see most of it pretty well because the moon was out that night and from what I remember, the skies were pretty clear.   I pulled my self back in to tell my sister, but my family often made fun of me for liking the movie Mack n Me so they never believed me.  They thought I was making it up.  I never told anyone this since because to be honest it makes me sound like a lunatic.  I dont know why I wanted to suddenly research this years later, but I did.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
Triangular shape with lights in a V, no sound, very slow moving.;1997-10-01 22:00:00;20 min;Triangular shape with lights in a V, no sound, very slow moving. I was driving towards my house and noticed a bright orange light in the distance barely above the treetops.  It seemed stationary as I drove toward it. I thought it must be a tower or a planet because of the orange light. When I got home, my yard faced the direction of the light and I told my mother to come outside and look at this light that I've been watching for five to seven minutes. We came outside, and about five minutes later, the light began to get larger as it was moving toward us. My mother and I constantly asked each other What is that and we felt all giddy inside. I've grown up near an Air Force base and have seen plenty of flying objects butntohing like this!  As it came closer, it made no noise.  It passed directly overhead very slowly, and had five lights arranged in a V shape on its underside. It never made a sound. It seemed to be barely above the treetops and bigger than a house by far.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
My 2 children and I were heading out to the store.  We live near an air force base so we constantly watch the skies for odd aircraft.;2005-09-05 23:30:00;1-2 min;My 2 children and I were heading out to the store.  We live near an air force base so we constantly watch the skies for odd aircraft.  This night as we were leaving our street to get on the main rd we noticed a slow moving craft to our right in the sky not very far up maybe 500-800 ft. with 3 white lights in a triangle shape on its bottom. It was moving so slowly we thought it was wierd so we stopped to take a closer look as we slowed the craft smootly banked to the left and slowly crossed the road we were on and within about 10 sec it had done a complete 180 degree turn and was heading the opposite direction. My children and I knew this was an impossibility because 1) we hear aircraft all the time overhead, and this on made no sound what so ever 2) It moved way too slowly for anything that we normally see 3) The size of the arc created by the turn was only about the width of 8 streets. The size of the craft was huge maybe 200 ft wide triangular shaped, dark maybe black or grey. We turned around to follow it to get a better look but as we did it seemed to silently accelerate with amazing speed to a point we could not keep up with it. Anyway I''ve been waiting my whole life to see one now I have and I have my children as witnesses.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606

As i looked up i thought it was a satelite, but as i looked closer I could see the lights were on an object which was stationary in the sky just to the south of our location. We rushed home and grabbed my video camera and headed back to the spot where we had spotted the object but it was no where to be seen.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
Charleston Area UFO June 27, 2010.;2010-06-27 04:40:00;5 minutes;Charleston Area UFO June 27 2010 I went out to smoke a cigarette before going to bed and saw a bright light through the trees to the west. I stepped out into the yard to see what it was.  The light was very bright.  What made it interesting is that the light was solid and not blinking.  It was probably about 2,000 to 3,000 feet off the ground.  It was moving in a straight line.  No noise was heard from the triangle shaped object.  As I watched this craft moving to the east and it started to fade from my line of sight, I heard jets taking off from the nearby Charleston AFB.  Were they trying to chase this craft?   As the craft got further away to the east it started changing colors rapidly from red to blue to white and green.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606

V shaped crafts, 3 of them in a Triangle formation VERY Close.;2012-12-29 01:00:00;5 minutes;V shaped crafts, 3 of them in a Triangle formation VERY Close I was out camping trying to light a fire (my friends had just left to get some food)When these 3 crafts came off in the distance coming directly in my direction.  They were right over the tree line.  They was very close. There were three of them, all shaped like a V.  Each one had 3 bright glowing lights on the bottoms of the craft along with reds lights.  Also, all three crafts were flying/hovering in a triangle formation.  I quickly climbed on a rocky hill to get a better look. They were a couple hundred feet above when I gave a signal with my flashlight and then they pivoted 90 degrees to my right and flew off rather fast.  I was alone in the dark scared shitless.  At first i thought it was a military aircraft (on the account of a nearby local airforce base)  But military aircraft do not hover that low to the ground in such a tight formation.  Apparently a few other people saw similar things in the Lowcountry in the past month.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
three hovering triangular objects in a stacked formation;2013-09-10 05:15:00;unknown;three hovering triangular objects in a stacked formation was on interstate 26 east bound as I am every morning at 5am, I was approaching Summerville exit and thought I saw a radio tower on my right, it was extremely bright and as I approached it was three triangular crafts hovering in a stacked formation? they were very close to the highway.  I could look up on the right and they were just above tree line in an open space above some retail buildings no noise and they didn't move i then saw which had to be to air force jets circle around close and then went out wide, as I was traveling further eastbound i could see the jets circle wide and back to the objects.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
Huge Craft in South Carolina Sky (Summerville);2015-07-20 22:00:00;15 minutes;Huge Craft in South Carolina Sky (Summerville) Five minutes after the fore-mentioned time, a vibration interrupted our household and myself as well as my girlfriend proceeded to observe an aircraft come low and turn sharp overhead our community.  Others were outside alongside the street.   It circled around over the course of 15 minutes and returned in the same way, exiting in the same direction.  On both wings I saw a stable red light.  The front was conventionally triangle-shaped, with the back end open.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
Saw a v-shaped object with 6 white lights and 1 red light in the center.  ((anonymous report));2016-11-09 18:30:00;8 minutes;Saw a v shaped object with 6 white lights and 1 red light in the center.  I was headed towards them from about 2 miles out.  Thought it must be an airplane headed toward me, but as I continue forward it was not advancing towards me.  When I got closer, I realized it was over ingredients above the signal light at the intersection.   I  rolled my window down and heard no noise coming from it.
