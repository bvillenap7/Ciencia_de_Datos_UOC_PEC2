Glowing light that filled the entire sky over summerville south carolina starting small then growing large enough to cover the sky.;1969-07-31 20:00:00;an hour;Glowing light that filled the entire sky over summerville south carolina starting small then growing large enough to cover the sky. I'm not sure if this happened in  1969 or 1970 or 1971.  I listed it as July 31 1969 but am very unsure about the date.   I do remember that it was hot, very hot.   So I'm guessing it was in the Summer.  At the time, I was a very young boy.  My Father worked at the air base in Charleston but we lived in Summerville. I don't recall a lot of the specifics but will never forget what I saw and felt that night.  It started with a commotion outside.  I remember going out the door and seeing so many of our neighbors outside by the street all looking up.  As soon as I got to the edge of the carport, I could see it too. What is was is still difficult to say.  The only way I can describe it was like a glowing light, a light that started small and slowly grew large enough to fill the sky.  I don't know how long it lasted but at the time, to me it seemed to have lasted an hour. I remember everyone trying to decide what it was.. or more accurately what it was not. First thoughts were that it was from the air base but that didn't make sense.  There was nothing large enough there to cover the entire sky. I remember asking lots of questions about what it was but no one had any answers. There were at least 20 families on our street watching the sky.  I remember being scared to death and going inside my house with some of the neighbors.  When it was gone there were lots of phone calls and lots of discussions.  To this day, I don't know how it was ever explained.   I have told very few people of this incident for obvious reasons, most insist you are exaggerating or just not remembering the events accurately. To this day, I've not seen anything that can fill the entire sky with that kind of light.  I'd love to know what the news archives have on the event from that night.

A powerfull light in the sky.;2006-12-20 17:40:00;1 minute;A powerfull light in the sky. I was walking outside my house in Golfview Lane, Summerville. Saw a very brilliant light much more brillant than the planet Venus. I stop and remain watching the light in the clear sky. Suddenly the light dissapears for a couple of seconds, reappearing two or three seconds later in the same place place in the sky (NW). Again after a few seconds the light is gone. The object was always in the same place. No movement, no noise.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
very bright and fast moving light traveling low in a westerly to easterly direction;2007-12-12 21:30:00;2 seconds;very bright and fast moving light traveling low in a westerly to easterly direction I was walking out to my parking pad beside my garage and a low level craft with two lights in front and traveling from west to east, (from inland out toward the ocean) flew over my left shoulder and behind me, out over my quiet neighborhood until it vanished in the distance.  The origination point of the lights were very sharp and clear, so I assume the thing was very low.  It traversed the entire sky in about two seconds.  There was no noise whatsoever - an absolutely quiet night.  I understand how worthless this report is in and of itself, but I'm reporting it simply because there may be other (and better) reports in this area.  I'm sorry I couldn't be more specific and helpful. If it was as low as I estimate it was (possibly 100 feet over the ground), then the thing was going so fast it was completely unnatural and unusual.  There is an airport (the Charleston airport in that general direction, but this was no airplane.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
On November 23, 2008 I saw a blinking orange light in the sky that hovered for a few minutes and then disappeared.;2008-11-23 20:00:00;15 minutes;On November 23, 2008 I saw a blinking orange light in the sky that hovered for a few minutes and then disappeared. On the night of November 23, 2008 my girlfriend and I were on our way to her house after leaving a restaurant in Summerville, SC.  I looked up and saw this blinking orange light in the sky at about 8pm.  I know that it wasn’t a light from an airplane because I've grown up looking at planes and know what their running and landing lights look like.  This light was a lot bigger than any you'd ever see on a plane and it was blinking at a lot slower pace than that of plane lights.  As a matter of fact at the same time I could see a plane off in the distance and was watching both things at once.  The blinking orange light seemed to be standing still while I could see the plane moving across the sky towards it.  I then ended up driving under where the light was and I could see that it was actually moving straight up.  At this point I thought it may be a rocket launched by NASA or something, but I checked NASA's launch schedule and their last launch had been on the 14th and wasn’t due back until the 30th.  When we got to her house it was gone, had disappeared;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
Three red lights in triangle formation over Summverville, SC.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from retired submariner.  PD));2012-06-30 21:47:00;3 minutes;Three red lights in triangle formation over Summverville, SC I am a U.S. service member in the United States Navy submarine force about to graduate with a Bachelors Degree in Political Science.   My wife and I were leaving our neighborhood at approximately 21:47 EST when three red lights appeared in the sky.  They were in a triangular formation heading from a southeastern to a northeasterly direction at around 8-10,000 feet altitude.   At first we discounted it for airplanes or even helicopters but saw no flashing lights, and heard neither jet nor rotor noise.   The lights then just disappeared chronologically.  I tried to take a video with my cell phone but could not get the lights to show up on the screen.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606

Light in the sky, looked as if it was a star VERY close to earth but it was much closer than a star could be, very big light, stagnant.  Know with 100% certainty that it was not a plane.

8 red lights in the sky.;2015-10-10 22:20:00;45 minutes;8 red lights in the sky. My wife and I observed about 8 different red lights floating in their air for about a hour. They were loosely in a string, barely moving across the sky.  Some would disappear, then show back up in a different area on the horizon.   After about a hour, they all sort of lifted and left.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606

While star gazing and looking at the super moon in a telescope on a clear bright evening, man and woman noticed a bright, orange orb-like light flashing across the horizon for about 10 seconds.
