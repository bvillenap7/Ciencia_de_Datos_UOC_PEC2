As I let my dogs out at 5:45 am the morning of Friday, Sept 17, 2010, I was watching the stars.  I noticed a 7 light V formation of blinking lights in the South East sky. There was no sound involved. They stayed in perfect formation and flew from the Southern sky to the Eastern, as a flowing motion. The lights that blinked were white and red and did not blink at the same time. The lights blinked as if they were airplane lights. Military training does not go on at night. The following what it looked like.  			 						. 				. 			.							. 		.								. 	.											 		. 			. 				.			;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
