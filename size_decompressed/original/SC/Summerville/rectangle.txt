This morning I got dressed and went out back of my house to cut the grass. I was looking around at the mess of my back yard and something caught my eye. There was a rectangle shaped box flying over my neighborhood above the treeline. The box was shiny and reflecting the sun. I saw now blades or propulsion of any kind. The whole time looking at it my eyes were watering from the sunlight so it was hard to really make out any other details. It was traveling west to east fairly slowly but high enought that it was hard to determine size and speed. It traveled out of sight within 45 seconds.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
