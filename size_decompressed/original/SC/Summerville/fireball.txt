3 burning objects hovering.;2011-05-22 08:10:00;4 minutes;3 burning objects hovering A coworker and I were driving home from James Island.  When we reached Trolley road in Summerville 3 circles that seemed to burning on the ends were hovering in the sky.   We watched them for a minute and when we proceeded to exit the veichle to gain a better view the fireballs flew away in the opposite direction.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
Large, bright green light accomanied by a deep whirring noise;2012-05-29 22:15:00;1 minute;Large, bright green light accomanied by a deep whirring noise I do not necessarily believe in UFO’s but I can find no other explanation for what I saw last night. It was about 10:15 and I was suddenly awoken by a very bright light. We had been having heavy rain and possible storms so my first thought was that it was lightening.  However, the rain had let up at this point and the light didn’t flash like lightening. It stayed for a few seconds and then disappeared. Also, it was accompanied by a sound that was a low, deep humming or whirring that faded in and out each time the light appeared and disappeared.  My mind started racing with possibilities so when it happened again, I thought it could be a car in a cul-de-sac behind us but the sound and the light didn’t match that scenario either.  I jumped out of bed when it happened a third time and far to the left, right above the tree line, I saw a very large and very bright green light the color of the green on a stop light.  It seemed very close. I yelled for my husband to come look but it was gone by the time he woke up.  The light didn’t show again and there were no other sounds associated with it.  I’ve been searching for a plausible answer as to what it was but there is none.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606

They saw this gold- illuminated, flickering but not flashing, as if made of fire. No other lights....pure gold light. Moving quickly at first, then slowed and decreased altitude, then disappeared over the treeline behind our home. There was no sound whatsoever and I think at the decreased altitude, we would have heard some sort of sound. We heard nothing.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
