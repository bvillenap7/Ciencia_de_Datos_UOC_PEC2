Red lights over Summerville, SC.;2016-05-15 21:30:00;2 minutes;Red lights over Summerville, SC. My wife was outside with the dog and called me out of the garage.  She said look up in the sky over there (W) in the distant there were numerous orange/red lights moving from west to east.  At first I thought they may be helicopters, but I couldn't hear the rotors.  Slowly the lights started to fade away and then across the sky more light started to appear, they were flying in a V- formation, then they started to separate to fly in their own paths.  I walked down the road trying to see what they were, but then they just dissapeared.  My daughter also saw the light when she came out of her bedroom, through the window in our loft.
