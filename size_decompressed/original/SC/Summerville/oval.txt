I was going outside at 10:50 PM to let our dog out in our backyard. As I was outside I saw a lit-up ring. It was late at night so I thought I was seeing things, so I call my husband to come out, and I get binoculars. I go outside and it is still there. I take my binoculars and see it and for about 2 minutes it is just still. It was very big though. On the UFO I see yellowish-orange lights with a red tint on it. So about 2 to 3 minutes later it starts moving super fast. It jerked from side to side, then jerked up and down, and it kept repeating the same motion. About 11:10 PM we went inside cause we were tired. But we could still see it as we were going to bed. We don't know when it went away. I will say that my husband might have seen a shooting star across the sky, so we don't know if it could be a meteorite, but we never saw it fall to earth.;32.9858646387833;-80.1841724334606
