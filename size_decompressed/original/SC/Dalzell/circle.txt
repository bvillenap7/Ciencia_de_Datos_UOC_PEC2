UFO?? Dalzell, South Carolina;2020-01-22 18:40:00;5 minutes;UFO?? Dalzell, South Carolina This is the third night this week we have seen these UFOs. Except this time there was 6 and not one like the last two nights. There was also something different this night as well because we had done strange phenomena like weird bangs, shuffling along the side of our house and then what appears to be interference within the video recording itself.  There is the main UFO or orb followed one by one by 5 smaller colored light UFOs or orbs. 1 orange, 2 white light, 2 red light, and 1 blue light.  The blue light only appears after the ground phenomenon around us which also captured in video.  Below is the link to the YouTube video. I recommend turning up the volume and pull up the big screen because this is just beyond anything I can describe in words. Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this and 3 nights in a row has me on edge.  https://youtu.be/DttBu7_hnvU  Thank you, take care  Ariane Willians;34.0183;-80.4662
