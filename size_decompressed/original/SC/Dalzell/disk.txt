I got out my camera and witness a large circular object with 3 distinct spot lights shining in a row downward. I watch a helicopter and 2 planes, one of them being a cargo plane fly directly under this object, and this object never flinched. At one point it actually jumped in what appeared to be a backwards notion from where I was at, because my camera lost focus of it when it moved and was unable to zoom in as far as previously. I watched this object for at least 45 minutes move south thru Sumter.  I got in my car at one point and watched it sitting in open sky in what looked like an open field area towards AFB. The spot lights never dimmed they only seem to change direction. I don’t know what this was. I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ve been in the military all my life, I’ve lived near military bases all my life. I’ve NEVER seen ANYTHING like this. I have no explanation, I’m truly stumped.;34.0183;-80.4662
