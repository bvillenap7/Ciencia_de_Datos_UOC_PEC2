The next night i went to bed about 11:00 pm and around 2:00 am i awaken some one or something was looking at my hand which i the doctor had in a cask i felt my hand up off my pillow and as it turn from one side to the othere i was afraid to open my eyes than i heard a movement of someone going from beside the bed which  was close to the dresser. after i thought what ever it was gone i got up right away and turn on the light.  i wanted to see if my brother or sister -n-law was up but they were dead sleep i than went to the bath room and as i started to wash my hands  a bright light so bright  came throught the window it lit up the whole back yard and the bath room i ran back to bed and stayed wake the rest of the night.  My husband came the next night and i did not tell any one but that next night i ask my husband to go with me to the bath room and after i used the tolit he started to use it also while i wash my hand the light came from the wash room next to the bath room only to shine dead at me i say come look hurry look at this bright light he came over to look and time he got there it just went off before he could see it.
