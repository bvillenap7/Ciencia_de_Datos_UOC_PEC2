Disc shaped, changing colors rapidly, moving horizontally just below the full moon.  Started white, then like red, blue and green, and back to white.  Grew slightly larger as it changed colors and moved then quickly disappeared.  At first, I thought it was a falling star and then I realized it was moving horizontally and it was too colorful and bright.;34.3379;-79.4411
