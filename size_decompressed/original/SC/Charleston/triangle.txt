Hwy 61, triangular shape craft w/ multi colored lights on one side and red lights at points.;2010-10-21 22:30:00;1 min;Hwy 61, triangular shape craft w/ multi colored lights on one side and red lights at points. Flew over Hwy 61 while driving.  Thought was C-17 @ first but it was too low with no noise. It was triangular in shape with multicolor lights on one side and red lights at the points. It seemed to slow down and hover in the woods to my right as I was heading into Charleston.  I lost sight of it shortly after it flew over the hwy, as we were going in opposite directions.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Black triangle, white lights, three, night, clear, many stars, slow, afraid;2012-10-14 23:34:00;20 seconds;Black triangle, white lights, three, night, clear, many stars, slow, afraid It has been a beautiful, clear fall night so after an evening out, I opened the sunroof of my car to enjoy the fall air and relax for a moment. I was in awe at how many stars were visible and how clear the skies seemed. I had been sitting in the car for approximately twenty minutes, enjoying the air and listening to music with my seat reclined while I looked at the sky when I saw a large black triangle glide over my home and car. The triangle was large, black and isosceles triangular in shape. It had three lights one on each point. The lights were white but not brilliant enough to illuminate the bottom of the triangle for a closer inspection as the triangle itself seemed very black, blacker than the sky. The entire event occurred so quickly and I was so startled that I cannot tell how far away the object seemed I can only put it in perspective that it seemed much lower than a plane would fly. It was not flying as a plane would, either, since it was moving much slower and differently in the sense that when a plane moves across your field of vision, it does so in a linear fashion across the sky and this object's flight deviated in such a way that seemed unnatural and in-conducive to flight. I was very startled and, quite frankly, afraid after it left my field of vision and quickly restarted my car and ran inside. I am still afraid and have looked up for twenty minutes how to report a sighting. I'm not sure why I feel so compelled to tell someone about this and I feel quite foolish stating that I think I saw a UFO but I have no idea what I just saw. I am still quite shaken and will likely be up all night researching to see if anyone else has ever seen an odd black triangle in the Southeast.

Hovering craft, completely silent.;2013-09-15 21:35:00;6 seconds;Hovering craft, completely silent. Triangular object about 200-300 feet off of the ground. Had 7 lights on the underside all dim and light yellow.  About 8-10 feet high, enough for there to be inhabitants.  Side of the craft looked to be set at a 45 degree angle.  Lights were evenly spaced apart. I was riding my bike about to hit University when I saw what I thought was an air plane coming in for a landing in the west.  It took me a second to realize that there was no sound coming from it and it wasn't getting any larger and therefore was not an airplane. I stopped and listened a little harder for some sound and I noticed that the crickets and frogs were both silent in the area.  For a swampy area, I thought this was strange.  So I turned around and saw that this object was still hovering in the same area I saw before. I believe it knew I spotted it and slowly maneuvered itself behind the treeline a second after I regained visual contact.  It went south.  Again, there was absolutely no sound. About 10 minutes later down the road, I spotted a military cargo plane fly directly over me. It was heading south towards the area where I spotted the object.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339

Triangular object sighting in Charleston.;2014-10-31 22:58:00;? I was driving;Triangular Object sighting in Charleston I was driving on the James Island Connector towards James Island at 10:58 pm tonight (Halloween).  I was in the left lane (the fast lane) and I got a sense that somebody or something was watching me. Not in a bad or unsettling way, just had a sense I was being watched.  I then noticed a craft of sorts that was at about the 11 o'clock position from where my car was (that is to say it was on my upper left). I was in disbelief what I saw! A car behind me was driving very close to me, annoyed that I was going slow, not realizing what was in the sky. The lights on this aircraft were not too bright, about the same brightness as the lamps on the Connector. There were four lights all together- one on top and three on the bottom. The one on top was a little bigger than the other three. I was seeing this in the dark, but I could make out a pitch black background of the aircraft- it was a triangular shape. When I got home, I asked my husband what he thought it could be,! for we have a military base close by to us. He thinks I am making up this entire story. I hope you believe me that I am not telling a tall tale and I know what I saw. I am not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when I saw this. The craft was fairly low, that is what initially caught my attention. It  was about the distance away from the highway as a kite would be that was flying in the air. The craziest thing about it was it seemed not to be moving- it seemed to be stationary. I did not hear any noise. If you have any other questions for me, I will try to answer it.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339

Stranger Object Photographed.;2016-09-16 12:43:00;Unknown;Stranger Object Photographed. I was doing some photographic work in the area of Folly Beach & the Morris Island Lighthouse.  It seemed like a typical day of shooting, the sun was shining, a slight breeze blowing etc.....  There was nothing really noteworthy about the day, until I reviewed the photographs later that evening.  My camera had been set in a rapid fire mode, which allows for continuous shots to be taken as long as the shutter release is depressed.  In one frame or photograph, a bright orange triangular object appears.  This object is seen in only one of the photographs of this sequence.  The shot just prior too & the shot that follows are void of the object, as are any of the other photographs from that day.  The three shots mentioned above where photographed from the same vantage point and all within less than a second of one another.  Times on the photographs are as follows (12:43:13, 12:43:13, 12:43:14).  I’ve been trying to wrap my head around what it is that I may have photographe! d.  I’ve shared the photos with only a few close family members and friends, but none of their suggestions or ideals seem to provide a logical explanation.  I would truly like to have an experts opinion on this matter.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Completely silent, slow-stopped triangle aircraft.  ((anonymous report));2018-06-05 01:00:00;3-5 minutes;Completely silent, slow- stopped triangle aircraft My BF and I went out for a smoke on the desk.  We observed a slow moving light.  It stopped twice in the sky.  It crossed directly over our house.  It had a constant red light, along with white and green blinking lights, in an alternating pattern.  It was triangle in its shape.... of all the things that were odd about it- speed and the stopping in place-... it was the SILENCE of the aircraft was most disturbing.
