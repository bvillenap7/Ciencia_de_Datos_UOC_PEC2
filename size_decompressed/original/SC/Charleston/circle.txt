One evening, we decided to go down to a pier near the water which seemed to be a popular destination.  When we arrived, there were many other people around the aream probably 100 other people or so.  We walked down the pier to the water and, as we neared the end, we suddenly saw a VERY large object (much larger than a football field  it seemed to cover the sky) moving very slowly at a low altitude.  In fact, it was so low and so large, I can remember flinching and ducking because I was afraid that it was going to strike the large suspension bridge to our left.  The object was completely silent - almost like a vaccum of no noise - and I did not see any type of trail or emission coming from it.  We both quickly looked around wondering if anyone else was witnessing what we saw, but no one else seemed to see it.  Every other person present was carrying on as if nothing were happening.  I can distinctly remember being extremely confused and somewhat frustrated that no one else was seeing what we saw.  That is where my memory ends.  The situation is the same for my friend.  This event transpired some eight years ago, and she and I have conversed about it several times since.  We cannot remember what happened to the object, where it went, how we got back to our car, or even how we got back to our hotel.  We woke up in our hotel the next morning and continued our trip Washington D.C..  We were both very confused and somewhat scared of the incident.  We laughed about it to a degree, as young people will do, but we have recently spoken of our concealed fear and confusion about the sudden loss of memory.  Neither my friend nor I had been drinking or taking illegal drugs on this trip or in any period of time immediately prior to or subsequent of it.  We are both college-educated, working professionals with families.  Both of our memories of the actual event are exactly alike.  We both saw an extremely large, black object with many small lights (or what appeared to be lights).  The object was so large that it covered most of the sky and it was flying at less than 300 feet (my best estimate).  It is difficult for me to state the exact shape of the object because it was so large.  However, it was rounded on the front end (the end that was moving toward the bridge), so I assumed it was either circular or oval in shape.  I was fearful of it for the brief period of time I saw it, but now, looking back, I’m very curious to know what it was and what happened to us after we witnessed it.

large sphere stationary for an hour;2001-06-20 17:30:00;1 hour;large sphere stationary for an hour Let me first say that I have always been a sceptic, though I have tried to keep an open mind about all things. Well, it was pretty weird and I feel even weirder talking about it. I wish I could remember the exact day and month, but I think is was in the middle or late part of June in 2001. My father brought it to my attention in our front yard. Facing north-north east and looking approximately 65 degrees up we were staring at a fairly large sphere that was orange/red in color. At first I thought it was a star in the early evening, but quickly brushed that aside when I saw other stars near it. They were basically dwarfed in size. I am familiar with the sky in that area as having lived there for many years and watched the stars and meteor showers with my father over the years. soon my mother joined us. I ran to get my fathers binoculars and when I came back, our neighbors had pulled up and jokingly asked if we were trying to find aliens. When we pointed to the sky, the neigbor ran inside to get HIS binoculars and him, his wife, and my family all wached it for almost an hour. It did not move, nor did it change color, yet at the end of the hour, it quickly faded away (while looking through the binoculars, it was an intense bright, hot orange/red and as it faded it shimmered a shade of sliver....maybe the sun relecting off a craft???). It was not a reflection of the sunset off a star, as I have often watched the sky over the years and previously noted that the stars in the rest of the sky were quite small in size in comparison (I have always been intrigued by astronomy and took several classes in college). I have no clue what this was, but there were 5 adults watching this phenomenon.... one ex military, one working in media, one school teacher and 2 nurses. Any suggestions what it could have been??

Round object above US 17 Charleston, SC.;2003-07-19 13:00:00;15 Minutes;Round object above US 17 Charleston, SC. Traveling high above US Hwy 17 moving towards downtown Charleston in the West Ashley area an object was spotted moving in northerly direction.  The object was small and round, remained a constant height, had a whitish to silver tone but did not reflect light.  Its movement was characterized by being rather fast while the clouds above and below it were stationary. It moved northerly while also erratically moving left and right along its flight path while pausing in one spot on several occaisions.  My first inclination was a weather balloon but due to the stationary clouds above and below the object as well as the object's intermittent pauses in flight and seemingly random movements left and right I decided to file this report.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339

I was facing the ocean and saw a light from my left and thought it was an airplane.  It traveled across the sky in a straight line and stopped in front of where I was sitting.  It was not really close but it definitely was not far away - maybe a few hundred feet. Once the object/light was directly in front of me it stood still and then very fast went straight out towards the ocean.  It was incredibly fast and I was very confused at what I saw.  A few minutes later the exact same thing happened again.  This time I took a picture of the object while it was travelling away from me.  The only thing I could tell was that it was a light - I could not see any kind of body with the light.  Also, I don't think there was any noise with it but I can't remember. I told my family about this event when it happened and just yesterday I read the articles about the Navy pilots that experienced object sky over the East coast.  I wanted to report this in case you want to see the pic.  It isn't a great pic but is shows a red ball of light.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339

It was stationary with a blue, red, green swirling light.   The object tend to move slightly southeast and stay there for a few seconds.   The object then turned the opposite direction and moved fast towards the North.   I didn’t see it after that;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
