Observed very bright sky illumination over Charleston, SC.  1-2 seconds duration.;1998-10-04 21:10:00;1-2 seconds;Observed very bright sky illumination over Charleston, SC.  1-2 seconds duration. While taxiing in, following a military training flight, night turned to day for 1-2 seconds. We had a thin stratus layer around 6000 feet and only saw the flash---figured it was a large lightening flash.  But... heard a civil (commercial) aircraft ask Charleston Tower if they saw that. The tower didn't see it but the commercial pilot described a very impressive, bright streak that looked like a large meteor. If needed, Charleston Int'l Tower has the tapes doubt if they would release it, since there was no mishap involved.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
