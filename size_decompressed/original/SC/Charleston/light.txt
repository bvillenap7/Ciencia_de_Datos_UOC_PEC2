Flashing object above Charleston, SC;1996-10-10 22:00:00;5 min;Flashing object above Charleston, SC   My friends and I were gathered in a courtyard of an apartment complex in downtown Charleston.  Being downtown among all the streetlights, only the brightest stars are visible.  I was reclining on a lounge chair when I noticed a light flash above the roof of the complex.  It seems odd that it flashed just once and was gone.  I stared at that spot for a few moments and then it flashed again, about 5 degrees from the original spot.  This continued and I started counting between flashes.  Each interval was a full 15 seconds! This contined all the way across the sky and by the time it reached the opposite roof of the courtyard, everyone was looking up at the sky.   I walked outside the complex and watched it until it disappeared behind a building next door.  I thought it was very strange because it wasn't moving fast enough to be a satellite and aircraft lights usually stay on continuously.   I spoke to my father about it and 2 years later he and my brother saw the same thing above the Blue Ridge Mountains while observing Saturn with a amateur telescope.   He tried to focus the telescope in the object but could not.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))  Single craft tremendously high moving north north east explodes;2005-04-29 20:55:00;5 minutes;Single craft tremendously high moving north north east explodes continuing in the same directions as two crafts. Single craft (point of light) moving north, northeast - very high - as it moved it appeared that light bent around it in either direction - easily 100 times the length of the craft itself. There was what appeared to be some sort of explosion (no sound only a circle of light) followed by two crafts (points of light) moving in the same direction. One moving faster than the other. After the explosion the bent light was no longer and the two points of light progressed with no visible means of propulsion and leaving no trail. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339

Unfortunately what ever this was went out of my sight due to a pine tree obstruction. I looked about above the tree and waited for it to return to my vision across the other side of the tree but it was gone.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Two lights in the sky that stopped and hovered above us before shooting off in different directions very fast.;2008-07-12 21:00:00;2 minutes;Two lights in the sky that stopped and hovered above us before shooting off in different directions very fast. I just found this website, but my experience was a number of years ago. My friends and I were sitting on the roof of my apartment building in Charleston, playing guitar and chatting for about an hour when I leaned back against the roof and saw what I thought at the time were two shooting stars.  I said out loud to my friends, Oh my god guys, shooting stars..   About the time I got the words out of my mouth the lights stopped directly over us for what seemed like minutes, but was probably more like 30 seconds.  They lights had no sound and they just hovered above us. Soon after they stopped, both crafts shot off in different directions extremely fast in a zig zag way, before they disappeared from sight.  All of us just sat there in silence, kinda in disbelief.  Then, once we realized what we had just witnessed, we collected our stuff and went back inside.  I would think I was crazy if I didn't have so many other witnesses.  I kinda would like to know if a! nyone else in the area has reported this....;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Very bright light travels across night sky in slightly irregular path and then fades;2010-09-13 20:42:00;3 min;Very bright light travels across night sky in slightly irregular path and then fades Starting at about 20:42 on 13 Sep 2010, two witnesses observed an object travel across the sky starting from the northwest and traveling to the southeast. It appeared about the same size as a planet seen in the night sky, appeared to travel faster than an airplane and stayed a steady, yellowish light that was brighter than Jupiter.  While it moved in primarily a straight line, it did appear to both observers to have slight wobbles or jogs in the trajectory. It appeared much brighter than other space debris or satellites that we have seen. It traveled across about 80-90 degrees of the sky, and then gradually became less bright and then disappeared altogether.  We observed it for about 3 minutes from when we noticed it to when it faded away. It was primarily notable due to its brightness, speed, and how long it stayed visible. Both observers are professionals with scientific backgrounds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339

While glowing a redish and orange color the object slowed almost to a complete stop then moved very quickly out of sight.;2014-06-25 21:15:00;3 minutes;While glowing a redish and orange color the object slowed almost to a complete stop then moved very quickly out of sight. My father and I were kayak fishing all afternoon and into the night when about 9:15pm when we were paddling back to the boat landing right off the Wando River, I noticed a very bright orange light slowly moving through the sky.  The light was bright at times, while turning into a redish color then turning orange I wondering if it was a satellite reflecting the sun.  The reason why I am reporting this is because the object slowed down almost to a stop in the sky then moved very quickly until the light faded away out of sight.  I find this very odd.  This was no satellite or plane of any any kind.  The shape of the light seemed to be square at times while it was fully lit.

Three bright white lights moving across the sky stopped abruptly and formed into a triangle and then an L shaped formation.;2015-07-12 10:40:00;25 minutes;Three bright white lights moving across the sky stopped abruptly and formed into a triangle and then an L shaped formation. Three lights (looked like bright stars or planets) were moving at a steady pace from south to north across the sky before abruptly slowing and forming into a triangle.  Their motions were very counter-intuitive, unlike any aircraft I’ve ever seen.   They then then loitered for a couple of minutes, before started moving north again where they reformed into what looked like a crooked L-shaped constellation in the sky.   They stayed fixed in that formation for several minutes before they started to slowly, almost imperceptibly drift apart.  From the south, two green flashing lights, which I presumed to be aircraft(s), approached at a steady pace.  They too stopped abruptly in the sky and loitered off to the south an unknown distance from the other objects.   As they stayed perfectly still, the three objects to the north began to slowly drift apart in different directions, eventually fading off.   Meanwhile, it appeared that aircraft were approaching were approaching from t! he south in the direction of the objects.   After approximately ten minutes, the flashing green lights started moving south again and disappeared into haze of the night.  They didn’t turn around they simply reversed direction, after sitting motionless in the sky.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339

We stepped off the porch into the yard to get a better view. There were 4 flashing white lights moving very eratic across the sky.  It lasted for about 5 minutes before they finally flew out of view.  I wanted to make a video but I knew my camera wouldnt be able to catch anything.  It was a very cool experience to get to witness.  I hope they come back soon.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
