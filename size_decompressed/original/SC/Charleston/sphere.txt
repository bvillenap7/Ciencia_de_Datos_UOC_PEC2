Green flaming ball streaking from north to south with tail behind;1998-12-20 19:30:00;3 seconds;Green flaming ball streaking from north to south with tail behind While driving along in my car I saw a burning ball, greenish in color, streaking across the sky from north to south.  It appeared for approximately 3 seconds.  At first I thought it was some sort of firework, but, it was too large and it did not burst as most fireworks do.  It had a tail that made it appear as one would think a comet would appear, but then it went out of view.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
silver orb associated with chemtrails;2003-11-14 14:50:00;5 minutes;silver orb associated with chemtrails I had stopped the car at a park and got out to watch planes spraying what looked like chemtrails. I had just ran across that subject on the net and waas surprised  the first time I looked up at the sky and saw what I had just been reading about. There was only one other car at the park and I asked the lady in it if she had binoculars or camera, but she didn't. She got out of the car and as we observed the 3 planes apparently spraying, we noticed a small flash of light right at the junction of 2 trails, where the trails made a large X in the sky. The flash was only momentary and we couldn't perceive what it was, it seemingly ddisappeared.  We turned our backs on that spot to follow a certain plane as it was preparing to swing back around for another flight over the city.  Then we saw, at our left field of vision, a peculiar object. It seemed to rather glide, and it maitained a consistent altitude, and it came our direction.  I became rather frightened as it approached. It was not too far away, not so high. (I have difficulty estimating distance and altitude, as I've never had a reason to do so before) At first I thought that whatever it was, it was the same thing as I'd just seen, ie. that flash of light, though it may have been a totally different thing. As it got closer, I  could see that it appeared metallic silver, and it was perfectly spherical.  Also, completely silent. When it reached a point that was more or less in front of us I noticed that it seemed to be exuding a purple or violet haze.  I asked the lady with me if she could see the color, but she couldn't see it. I know that as an artist I am more sensitive to color that the average, non-artist.  The color was not solid, the substance seemed to be a vapor, a mist, or like a gas.  When it just about had made a complete 180 degree parade across our field of vision, it began to ascend, rather quickly, and straight upwards. This sighting occured on a relatively clear day. I don't use drugs or alcohol, and don't take any medicine that would interfer with perception. I can't speak for the other witness, but I did find out that she was a Christian also, and after this incident we were both frightend and we prayed together before leaving the park.  Two days later, over my house, I watched similar planes apparently spraying.  Another silver orb seemed to appear at the X mark of the trails.  This orb I saw through my binoculars and it was at a high altitude. I maintained sight of it for only about a minute.  I reported these incidents to the local Air Force Base, and to the local FAA district manager but no one wished to take a report.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Gold, non moving light in sky that vanished completely over river near Charleston;2004-12-14 23:00:00;5 seconds;Gold, non moving light in sky that vanished completely over river near Charleston Was driving home to North Charleston from Mt. Pleasant on the 526 or Mark Clark expressway and saw a dim gold sphere in the sky.  I always watch the skies around here and have seen some pretty strange things before.  It wasn't moving at all and then it completely vanished right where it was with no light, nothing but black sky to be seen.  Very errie to be watching something motionless over the river for a few seconds then have it vanish right before your eyes.  Almost unworldly.  Just the night before I was out sky watching because a relative came home and said they saw a falling star.  I drove out and saw two from a downtown park and believe these are a result of the genemid meteor activity here recently.  And recently in our Charleston papers, there was a story about the mysterious boom sounds of the east coast.  We learn that they have been happening for over a hundred years with no explanation yet.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Orange lights seen over the ocean from Charlseton Harbor;2012-10-23 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;Orange lights seen over the ocean from Charlseton Harbor On the night of October 23, 2012, my friends and I were in the Charleston Harbor on a boat.  We saw a bright orange light over the ocean that began to separate into other orange lights in a horizontal fashion.   As soon as all of the lights would go out, another bright orange light would appear miles away, at different altitudes, and they would also begin to divide into more orange lights.    This lasted for about 5 minutes and was seen happening over Isle of Palms all the way to Folly Beach and everywhere in between.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Sphere with red glow within and bright orange light beneath, chased by helicopter.;2014-03-15 23:30:00;4 minutes;sphere with red glow within and bright orange light beneath, chased by helicopter. There were over a dozen of us around the fire, when the host asked, What is that?, we all looked to see bright orange light directly above which was a perfect circle which was glowing red from within.  It moved slowly and silently just above the tree line.  At one point it stopped as if to decide on a new course, as soon as speculation of what it could be began there was the distinct sound of helicopters.  The helicopter flew in my range of sight at tremendous speed, it had its search lights on, but pointed straight ahead rather than at the ground, it also had a large green light on its side, which I initially thought were navigation lights.  the sudden appearance of the helicopter drew my eye away from the orb, when I looked back in the direction I'd last seen it there was nothing. I have grown up here, sandwiched between the international airport and the air force base, however what I witnessed this night did not remotely resemble any craft ive seen prior.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
5 solid green lights moving from SSE to NNW.;2014-08-30 22:09:00;3 minutes;5 solid green lights moving from SSE to NNW. 5 green lights were seen moving from the SSE to the NNW at 10:09 PM, on 8/30/2014, in Charleston, SC.   Two groupings were seen, three lights in front, two in rear.  Lights were moving relative to each other and stars could be seen between the lights indicating they were not connected by any solid object.   All lights were moving at generally the same speed in the aforementioned direction.  The first three lights moved only slightly in relation to each other.  The trailing two lights moved at great speed in relation to each other, where one light moved 270 degrees around the other light in approximately 10 seconds.   The movement was not in a perfect arch, again suggesting the two were no physically connected.  While the trailing lights were performing the 270 degree movement relative to each other, one of the leading green lights became intensely bright relative to the others.   This could best be described as seeing a laser pointer that was suddenly pointed direc! tly at the observer.  This lasted approximately 5 seconds.  Lights did not blink and were constant, and their brightness in comparison to each other was similar, with the exception of the sudden brightening of the one object.   Light intensity could be described as that of a slightly brighter than a standard green airplane navigation light at approximately 1,000 to 2,000 feet (as compared to known aircraft landing at CHS on most any other night). Absolutely no noise of any kind was heard during the entire sighting. Lights were first seen approximately 45 degrees from directly overhead and it took approximately 60 seconds to move to the corresponding 45 degree angle.  90 degrees were covered in approximately 60 seconds.   The objects were seen for another 90 seconds, moving to the NNW, until they slowly faded from sight.  No additional movement relative to each other was seen at that point. Many flights go over the house in the direction of Charleston international airport.  The direction of these lights was different in that it was 30 degrees to the west of the normal flight pattern to the airport. Sky was clear, no clouds.  No haze was observed. The pattern below generally reflects the relative position of each light although there were subtle variations of this during the observation.  The distance from the lead light to the trailing light was the distance from the pinky to the thumb with full spread of fingers at arm’s length when the objects were directly overhead.  The distance from the two trailing lights to each other was approximately the size of a half dollar at arm’s length. 							X 		X							X X  						X 								  Given the speed the trailing two objects moved relative to each other, it gave the impression that these objects were not at any appreciable height.  The general speed of the objects across the sky was much slower than an aircraft landing at CHS.  A landing aircraft takes approximately 15 seconds to cover the same 90 degree arch these lights covered in 60 seconds.  However, landing aircraft are only visible for approximately 20 to 30 seconds where these lights were visible for 90 plus seconds before they slowly faded into the distance.  That gives the impression these lights were higher in altitude which contradicts the impression of a lower altitude given by the relative movement of the trailing two objects. My wife observed the objects for 10 to 15 seconds before calling me outside to see them.   We were the only two witnesses that we know of.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
We saw single orange ball of light moving slowly with no sound in night sky.;2015-04-08 22:10:00;<1 minute;We saw single orange ball of light moving slowly with no sound in night sky. We saw one orange ball or orb of light moving south to north high in the night sky.  There was absolutely no sound as it moved slowly finally disappearing beyond the trees.  It was bright enough we could see the light well after it had gone behind the trees.  The single light looked to be about 5 times the size of that of a light on an aircraft.  It was definitely an orange light and not red like an aircraft.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Bright red light sphere moving silently and very low in the sky;2016-02-01 21:55:00;1 minute;Bright red light sphere moving silently and very low in the sky Went out for a walk with the dog, at 9:50pm EST and after 5 minutes of walking down the road, both, my mom and I, saw a glowing bright red light sphere, moving horizontally above us, across the sky.   The object moved  with a steady speed, light was mostly red, glowing with yellow and orange tones, was moving at a significantly lower altitude than an airplane or even a helicopter, and it was making absolutely no noise.   It took it a minute or so to pass us, after which it blinked and disappeared.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Two red-orange glowing orbs in the sky above North Charleston, S.C., witnessed by two.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-23 20:00:00;1 minute;Two red-orange glowing orbs in the sky above North Charleston, S.C., witnessed by two. My wife and I saw two red-orange glowing orbs over North Charleston, S.C.  They were some distance apart horizontally, but the same exact height in the sky.  It was just before 8P.M. so it was still light outside.  They were below the cloud line, so not very high in the sky.  They didn’t move at all.  They were so still, I can’t even say that they looked to be floating, more that they were just fasten to the sky.  The light they produced was from the entirety of the orbs.  I mean it wasn’t something with a red light on it, that would have looked different.  They were glowing.  We were about to get off the interstate when my wife noticed them, as we got off it we went below the tree line and couldn’t see them anymore.  We drive this way quite often at around the same time and have never seen anything in the sky where these two orbs were.

Red glowing half-sphere;2020-11-05 18:27:00;4 minutes;Red glowing half-sphere We saw a red glowing object appearing to be similar in size, if not larger, to a star in the sky. Arising off the object, above and below, was a red half-sphere. Imagine the letter ‘C’, but almost cone-shaped, and the red object would be the tip of the cone. This object appeared to glide through the sky at a high altitude— we were able to observe said object for approximately four minutes, it gradually became no longer visible. The object appeared to have changed direction becoming more and more faint in color, however the altitude seemed to have remained the same. At the time that the object apparently changed direction we saw a second glowing spherical object descending toward us, it disappeared once it got very close to the horizon. This second object appeared similar in nature to a flare, without a smoke trail- just the spherical red glowing object.  Observation Notes: two observers no noise obtained photo of second object unable to get photo of first object with phone;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
