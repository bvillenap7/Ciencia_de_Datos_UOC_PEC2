Noticed a blue bomerang shaped haze. Then noticed a light just inside of the center of the curve and that it was moving north northeast. After several seconds of watching the shapes a large sparking like a firework sparkler flashed for 2 seconds and the one light became 2. The first was a sharp bright light and the second was a hazey slower moving light. Like watching two stars. They then continued in the same direction but the second ligh was much slower. Niether appeard to loose altitude or have a vapor trail like a meteor or comet.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339

Appeared to be Japanese coating lanterns on 4 separate occasions. 2 people and video. Charleston SC.;2012-06-15 22:00:00;15-25 minutes;Appeared to be Japanese coating lanterns on 4 separate occasions. 2 people and video. Charleston SC The shape was more of a rectangle or cylinder but horizontal in its length. I have video on an old phone.  They appeared to be about 1-2miles away and floated as if on the wind.  There were no abrupt acceleration variances.  In fact they appeared to resemble what I would describe as looking like the traditional floating Japanese candle lanterns. My girlfriend at the time and I observed these objects on 3-4 separate nights fairly close together. ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Middle of the day, decent skies, up about 6 stories. It was all black, we thought it was the new amazon drone, but realized they weren't doing that currently. It had the same build, but different style. It was bulkier with thicker arms going into the propellers and had a smaller central body then the amazon drone.  Although I suppose its possible, I doubt its a toy. We were going 25-30mph through the back of a subdivision along the marsh and it passed us with no trouble and we eventually lost sight of it. I'd say it was going between 35-50 mph. I just cant think of a kids toy that could do this.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
