AfB and I walked off an airplane and looked across the horizon and saw it moving horizontally. I have seen thousands of shooting stars in 18 years of grave shift but this was the first one that flew straight across the horizon very low and then disappeared. It was not a falling object. Thanks;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339

My thought was it looked like a Roman candle because fire sparked from it in all directions before it just disappeared. It was similar to a shooting star but much brighter and closer than any I have ever seen.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
streaking blue/green fireball lit up sky. fireball going east to west and appeared to disintergrate after 3-4 seconds;1998-10-04 21:00:00;3-4 seconds;streaking blue/green fireball lit up sky. fireball going east to west and appeared to disintergrate after 3-4 seconds I am vice pres. of a real estate mgt company here in charleston and was walking on the Isle of Palms beach at approximately 2100 hours on sunday, october 4. Very , very suddenly the sky lit up extremely bright. I looked up thinking someone had launched a fireworks rocket and saw a streaking object that appeared to be a giant meteor racing across the sky from the ocean (east) towards the land (west to northwest).  It appeared to have a large head with an extremely long tail that was glowing a blue-green color. although the sky was already well lit from the full moon, the brilliance was magnificent. It was over in a few seconds. Many witnesses walking on the beach that night yelled at me and we all were in a state of awe.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Saw a large reddish orange fireball with a long green tail..;1998-10-04 21:00:00;seconds;Saw a large reddish orange fireball with a long green tail.. I was driving south on I-26 towards my home in Charleston SC around 9pm. A large object appeared from my left which I first saw in my peripheral vision. At first I thought it was a shooting star which is commonly seen drivng this route. However, as I focused, I saw it to be a large reddish orange fireball with a very bright and long tail. It appeared only briefly, shooting from left to right, just long enough for me to tell my 11 year old daughter to look at it. We rationalized it must have been a flare or fireworks, but the next day's paper confirmed our sighting. My background is that I have been a nurse for 22 years, with a degree in Nursing and a degree in Business. I am enrolled in graduate courses at the Citadel. As a child I witnessed a UFO following my brother and I though we told no one. I believe we are not alone in this Universe and we are foolish to even think we are.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
This was an amazing fireball!;2002-12-06 23:07:00;3-5secs;This was an amazing fireball! Location = Charleston SC Date and Time = 12/6/02 11:07pm EST approximately Fireball appeared from the W. Fireball disappeared from the E. How long, in seconds, were you able to see it in the sky? 4 to 5sec? About 90+° off horizon when it appeared. Disappeared at the horizon. Magnitude = moon+! Color blue, & yellow orange Clear persistent streak! Duration  unknown... Inaudible... This was an amazing fireball!   It lit up the night sky briefly as if it were a deep blue daylight.  I first noted that the dark sky began to lighten very quickly as if someone were turning on the daylight using a switch controlled by a rheostat. Like a bolt of lightning that grew in intensity over time. By the time I had eyes on it and realized that it wasn't lightning but a fireball, it must have been at about 80° of arc heading quickly toward the horizon from west to east.  I had a fortunate vantage point  as I was facing that direction precisely at the time. It was an awesome sight!  Tied with first for my most impressive fireball observation in my 34 years of life.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
Orange/fiery circular object streaking thru the sky but was gone within 3-5s of seeing it;2020-05-14 00:20:00;5 seconds;Was on a run and heading back home down Harborview, looked up above the tree line and saw something very similar to another report I saw on here: an orange/fiery circular object streaking thru the sky but was gone within 3-5s of seeing it.  Looked to be much closer/larger than a shooting star.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
