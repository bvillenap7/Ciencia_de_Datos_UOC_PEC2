For about 2 miles ahead of me (far left of the interstate) appeared to be very large 2 identical objects, both with running white dots (lights), plus, what's really weird is that they both were in a 'leaning' position.   As I took the next exit so I could head out towards where they were, next thing I saw were 2 red lines and then they totally disappeared.  I drove out to a high bridge and saw nothing left in the sky.  This is my 2nd UFO sighting I've seen (last one was last summer).  Can't wait to see another one!;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
