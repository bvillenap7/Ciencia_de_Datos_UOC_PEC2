I was with another witness that is ex-military\veteran & ex-fire (he stated he has never seen anything like this nor could he identify these).  Facing the West Ashley direction there were 5-6 very bright radiating orange to red orb shaped lights in a horizontal linear formation (with only one being slightly displaced). These lights were massive.  They appeared to be at a high altitude of 40,000+ feet but still extremely large in size (much larger than any C-17 or C-5 Galaxy could produce).  They slowly seemed to be moving in the direction of where I was standing.  And just like that, one of the lights dimmed out- then the rest just dimmed out with in a second.  I had to be standing there for 10 minutes watching this. I should have grabbed my phone to record but was just in complete awe.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
