As stated before I saw four airceaft in charleston SC heading south along the coast, one was leaving a trail that looked like soneone blowing smoke rings.  The others looked normal.  I brought this to the attention of others as being strange, at the time I had no idea as to the oddity.  I was listing to G. Gordon Liddy show one day and heard that this is the signuature of the AURORA aircraft, well last night I was listening to the Art Bell program and heard something about this again and this web site,thats about all I know, I'm sure that I saw the AURORA and would like to know more. Again I am not to sure of the time frame because I did not know what I was looking at.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
LOUD ROLLING BOOM!!!;2003-08-01 13:25:00;2-3 secs?;LOUD ROLLING BOOM!!! Loud thunderous explosive boom heard!  This was heard at least throughout the greter Charleston area, and further off possibly... certainly as far as Hollywood SC.  Likely too wide a range to be a thunderclap.  Local Coast Guard  had no idea what it was, a report from the air force base claims they had nothing to generate a boom of this sort in the air  at this time... and that when they perform manuevers that would generate a boom of this magnitude they would do it out at sea.  My expectation is that this was a meterorite that was large enough to make it into the lower atmosphere and generate a sonic boom, but small enough to not hit the ground or to have hit without observed incident.  Perhaps just off coast?  It there was a visible streak or fireball associated I have not heard an account of it.  some of the sky was obscured by clouds, otherwise it was a bright sunny afternoon.  www.NAtlantis.com ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having considerable technical experience.

It was round on the top and got narrower going to the bottom, round and narrow on the bottom and got wider going to the top the object looked like a top. It was all yellow lighted with red vertical lines all around the sides and it had an orange light in the middle of the top and in the middle of the bottom. It hovered over the house. And then it was still then it got down lower and went over the neighbors house. Then I looked up and it disappeared and it was gone. I didn't see the object no more. It made no sound. It was partly cloudy. I looked around the house and I still didn't see it no more. It was gone. I was wondering what this object was I saw and where it came from.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339

3 objects buzzing around in broad daylight and vanish in formation.;2020-01-05 16:22:00;:02;3 objects buzzing around in broad daylight and vanish in formation. Witnessed 3+ Flying objects that first appeared as birds, but were so far up in the sky it was hard to comprehend.  It was daytime, and the moon was out, but not one cloud in the sky.  The objects were buzzing around each other for over a minute when we noticed they began to get in a formation and the next second disappeared.  We looked all around the open sky, and couldnâ€™t make sense how they vanished so quickly.  They were white in appearance, but also appeared reflective.;32.8057390977443;-79.9702814536339
