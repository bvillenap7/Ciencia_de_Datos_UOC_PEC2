Large Craft hovering over Highway surrounded by Bright white lights;2011-09-09 21:00:00;20 sec;Large Craft hovering over Highway surrounded by Bright white lights 3rd Party Report from civilian witness.  Under investigation at this time, please contact me for further details if needed. I received a report of a Large Craft hovering over Grays HWY (HWY 278) Cross street Wooden Horse Run on the sharp Curve. Caller was very upset and stated that she just observed a large unidentified craft move and hover in front of her car from the sod farm fields next to the HWY at tree top level.  The current information I have is that the craft had an unknown number of bright white lights surrounding it or encircling it, after hovering for a moment it then departed at a very high rate of speed and was visible again in the distance through the trees on the opposite side of the HWY for a moment. Note:  I have also found that this isn't uncommon for that area and that in the past a vehicle was pursued or tracked by a similar object.  Obviously many of these reports are not readily shared. I also made a report about 2 years ago in which myself and a number of other Emergency Responders witnessed similar lighted crafts within 15min North of that area from different locations.;32.4827;-80.9784
