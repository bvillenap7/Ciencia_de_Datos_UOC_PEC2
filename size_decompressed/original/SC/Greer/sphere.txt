5 red spheres in sky Greer SC 9-13-11;2011-09-13 09:00:00;3-4 minutes;5 red spheres in sky Greer SC 9-13-11 We are a married middle aged couple who live in Greer, S.C..  While sitting on our back porch Tuesday night (9-13-11) around 9:00 to 9:30 pm .  I looked out in a southern direction to see 3 red lights traveling across the night sky.   All three looked the be the same size, altitude and equally spaced, but you could tell they were at different distances. Like traveling single file. It took us a minute or so to realize these lights were something we had not ever seen this kind of a sight before.  Even though we  live close to the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport, Google Maps has us at 2.09 miles.  We could not tell the distance or size even though the moon was very bright.  I ran inside to get our video camera and by the time I returned  only one of the lights could still be seen.   Oh well, I thought. Just as I put the camera down. T wo more of these red lights appeared from behind the trees just two doors down.  I grabbed the cameraâ€¦Started recording what we were seeing.  They were very close together, much closer than the first three.  They moved slowly across the sky parallel with each other, then one  started to move in a vertical direction.  One on top of the other.  They stayed this way until I stopped recording.  In our research we found a man and his child recorded this same type red sphere in 2009 also from Greer, S.C. Does anyone have any idea what this was?;34.9258130115423;-82.2399912906611
