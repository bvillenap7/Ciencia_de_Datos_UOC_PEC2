Orange flame looking object observed over Greer SC;2011-11-06 22:30:00;3-5 minutes;Orange flame looking object observed over Greer SC My wife and I saw what looked like an orange flame moving slowly above our house.  It was not round, but oblong with points at two ends at times.   The shape and size changed slowly, like a flame growing and shrinking.  It was much bigger than a star, but not as big as the moon, maybe 10 to 15% as big as the moon.  It was not distinct but seemed to come in and out of focus.   We could not gauge the altitude.  It moved from in front of the house to over the house and seemed to pause, then moved back to the front again.  Our house faces south east.   When I went in the house to get a camera, my wife said it seemed to shrink away to nothing before I came back.   She said it looked like the flame went out, not like it climbed in altitude.

Zig zagging star?;2018-05-12 22:30:00;5 minutes;Zig zagging star? The event lasted about 5 minutes, from 10:30 p.m., till about 10:35 p.m., on May 12th, 2018. For most of the siting, the craft appeared to be the size of a star and occasionally would elongate into what appeared to be a small oval.  Just to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me I looked at other stars and they were remaining still.  I braced myself against a wall to steady my observation.  The object moved in a straight line and in a zigzag pattern alternately.   The object covered a patch of Sky approximately 3 finger widths (2.25) at arm's length (21.5).  The viewing direction was about 10 degrees east of due south by compass.  The elevation was about 60 degrees above the horizon.;34.9258130115423;-82.2399912906611
