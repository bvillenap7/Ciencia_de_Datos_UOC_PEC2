saucer like object across the horizon 8:15pm southern sky, south carolina;2003-12-09 20:15:00;5 seconds;saucer like object across the horizon 8:15pm southern sky, south carolina myself, my wife, infant daughter, and two friends from wales had just left el a mexican restaraunt. we were all in the car when i said, look at that. it was after dusk, but before all light was gone. i thought that it might be a shooting star, but as i tried to explain the direction and what i was talking about, it arced and disappeared into the tree line. no one else i was with saw it. i couldn't believe it, i got out of the car and just said holy shit... holy shit. it was a cliched as thing as one could imagine. a saucer shaped object looked like it was made out of some brushed metal like aluminum. it was not herky-jerky, it moved smoothly and uniformly across the horizon. i followed it until it was out of sight. i used the compass in my car to determine that the object was in the southern sky.  it sounds ridiculous and if i was going to make something up, i would have not descibed the thing to look like a saucer of all things.  i have a college degree in photography and english and am an executive in the music industry. i am reasonable person who would normally dismiss such a thing.
