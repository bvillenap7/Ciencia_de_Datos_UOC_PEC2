It appeared as though it was there before I looked at the sky.  I stared at it for a good minute before it just dissappeared.  It looked like a candle being blown out.  Not even 30 seconds after the fireball dissappeared I saw at least 4 military jets flying towards the location of the fireball.   My uncle is a pilot and he was standing there with me and said that they were flying way too fast to be civilian airplanes.   We were both in a state of shock afterwards.;34.9258130115423;-82.2399912906611

I was flying a small plane in what appeared to a collision course, turned left to avoid, flew parallel half a mile away for maybe a minute or two, then these lights simply vanished, without any visible trajectory change.;34.9258130115423;-82.2399912906611
