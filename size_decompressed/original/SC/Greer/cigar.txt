White cylinder object disappears in a blink of an eye.;2020-04-22 08:58:00;1 minute;White cylinder object disappears in a blink of an eye. I was on my way to work when I witnessed a small white dot in the sky moving from west to northwest. I didn’t pay much attention thinking it was an airplane.  Suddenly it got moved my direction so much that I noticed it was a white cylinder.  Then suddenly it change to a gray metallic cylinder, and then it vanished.  It didn’t shoot off in any direction.  It just disappeared in a blink of an eye.  It was as if it was cloaking itself.  I stopped my car to look around for anything in the sky, but there was nothing.  It is a perfect clear day with no clouds in the sky.   I can’t explain what I witnessed today.;34.9258130115423;-82.2399912906611
