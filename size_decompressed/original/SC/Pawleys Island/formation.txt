At approximately 9:40 pm on May 14, 2019, we were sitting on the second floor balcony after dinner.  My friend exclaimed “What’s that?”     I immediately looked up and saw something in the night sky to the SSE of our location.  As soon as I looked up and saw the first lights, which were three horizontal lights, those lights disappeared as if they were “turned off”.  As those first lights were turning off, another set of three lights turned on, one at a time, then all three staying on for maybe 20 seconds.   Each light was shaped like a thin wide cat’s eye bright white with an orange glow….I know the exact time as I had my cell phone in m hand and immediately raised it to take a photo the object doesn’t  show in the photo.   We sat around speculating what it was and still don’t know.  I believe I could see the form of something behind the lights as if the lights were headlights on the object, whether a plane or whatever it is,  It did look dark.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
