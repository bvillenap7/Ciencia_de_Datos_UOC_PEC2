One directly over top the other. they appeared suddenly from seemly no where lasting several seconds, then like a switch was thrown disappeared. Suddenly after that the same strange glowing spheres appeared, this time 3 of them in a triangle.  One over the other with one to the left forming a triangle.  Lasting a few seconds then disappearing all at once. Several minutes later two appeared side by side (looked like orange/red headlights) at just above the ocean horizon.  These two lasted 10-15 seconds, then disappeared.  There were several people in chairs on the beach that witnessed it.  After this twinkling white lights were seen at the same point on the horizon moving back & forth up & down rapidly. These lasted several minutes.  Many on the beach thought they could be military.  We didn't hear any aircraft.   We saw a very similar I incident in Pawleys Island in May 2010 and reported it on this site.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998

First object rose from the area of South Litchfield Creek traveling south. Lasted approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared.   I continued walking north to the end of the north point.  I turned around and after walking approximately 200 hundred yards another object appeared coming from the same area and again traveling south for approximately 20 seconds and then disappeared.  There was no noise or flashing lights.  The winds were light out of the north.  The objects moved too quickly to be riding on the wind and did not waiver.  The general appearance was that of a fireball without a tail or trace.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
