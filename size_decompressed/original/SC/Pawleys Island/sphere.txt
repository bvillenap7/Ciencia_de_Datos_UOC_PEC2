Several orange, sphere shaped UFOs appeared off the coast of Pawleys Island, SC on 06/08/2011;2011-06-08 21:30:00;1 hour;Several orange, sphere shaped UFOs appeared off the coast of Pawleys Island, SC on 06/08/2011 We were sitting outside our beach house looking over the ocean.  Initially, we saw one orange/red light that began as a glow and got brighter until fading to dim and then disappearing completely. It was a circular/sphere shape.   Quickly, another light (that looked exactly the same) appeared just to the north of it at the same altitude and faded away as well.   After several minutes, more lights appeared simultaneously in the same general vicinity, all displaying the same characteristics.  The lights appeared on and off again across about a 40 mile stretch of ocean.  At most, there were about 12 lights at once.   Finally, four smaller, white blinking lights appeared in a straight line and traveled from off shore, over the beach and continued until they were out of our line of vision behind us.   Just minutes after that, the orange/red lights appeared back out over the water in front of us and were brighter than they had been previously.  They also appeared bigger and then faded completely.   We used binoculars throughout the viewing duration but were unable to identify any distinct characteristics of the UFOs other than what is listed above. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite eloquent, serious-minded, and sincere.  Please see other report from North Carolina for the same time and date.

Large orange glowing orb moving over Litchfield Beach;2011-07-22 21:00:00;4 minutes;Large orange glowing orb moving over Litchfield Beach On the night of July 22, 2011, at approximately 9:00pm, my 5 ½ year old son and I were on Litchfield Beach (Pawleys Island, SC).  We had just watched some small fireworks from people about 100 yards up the beach and remained on our blanket to look at the stars.  It was a clear night.  We were facing the ocean and lying down.   We gazed at the stars and talked as a few people walked by but we were eventually alone.  Other fireworks were seen about a mile up the beach (north).   After about 30 minutes I decided it was time to return to the beach house.  My son sat up first and when he turned around he immediately exclaimed about what he saw in the sky behind and to the left of us over land.   I sat up, turned, and was startled to see a large orange glowing orb (far larger than any aircraft relative to were it appeared--smaller, about half the size of  a full moon).  It was about 50 degrees above the horizon and probably under but close to 500 feet in altitude..  It appeared to moving toward us at first but was actually moving away (north) from us.    We watched it move slowly and smoothly in a straight line for almost 2 minutes before it disappeared into either isolated cloud cover or possibly the haze of Myrtle Beach lights many miles north.  My son was a little worried but I remained calm and explained that it was simply unidentified, and what that meant.    We talked about  what it could have been and another minute later I turned around (from the ocean facing inland) and it was there again but directly behind us and closer.  We both saw it.  It was clearly visible and seemingly a brightly glowing gaseous orange orb with a faint red outer tinge.  My son said, It looks like fire and gas  It was unlike ANYTHING I’d ever seen in the sky before   This time I was uneasy because it was quite ominous and eerie so when my little boy said, I think we should get out of here, Mom, let’s go  I stood up grabbed the blanket without shaking off the sand, and we quickly left, still watching it as we walked up and over the board walk.  (About 2 minutes time again that we viewed  the object).   On the golf cart ride back to the beach house, I remarked that no one was going to believe us.  We returned to the house and told all family members.  My son described  the object the same as I would have as orange and round and -on top what looked like a red cap.  It was little hard falling asleep just thinking about what we had seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and credible.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.  PD));33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
A series of bright orange spheres that appeared and then vanished.;2014-05-27 21:30:00;45 minutes;A series of bright orange spheres that appeared and then vanished. This event occurred as a series of orange spheres in the night sky over the ocean that lit up for a second or two, and then dimmed.  The first bright red/orange light that got our attention looked almost like a super-sighting of Mars at first, but then we realized that it was way too close, too large, and too bright.  Then it went out. Over the next 45 minutes, bright orange spheres high in the sky lit up in the same area - then went out, sometimes in a row of three, sometimes forming an angle.   On two occasions, six in a tight row lit up in quick sequence, then went out.  These were the last we spotted.  There were perhaps 25 light-ups in all. These were NOT fireworks--way too high in the sky and out over the ocean.   They did not rise or fall or leave any sort of trail they just appeared and then vanished.   I've never had any experience with anything like this before, nor do I have any possible explanation.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
