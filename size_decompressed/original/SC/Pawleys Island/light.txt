Sporadic, orange lights, unlike any common aircraft appear over the ocean;2006-07-13 22:30:00;30 min - sporadically;Sporadic, orange lights, unlike any common aircraft appear over the ocean After dinner with my extended family, two friends and I carried folding chairs out onto the beach adjacent to our house.  This was around 10:15 p.m. and we set the chairs up to face out over the ocean to get a good view of the moon rising.   We sat there for several minutes observing the sky as it was a clear, cloudless night.   We carried on a casual conversation as we tried to identify constellations and planets, and two of us even caught a shooting star.  Then, suddenly, around 10:30, I pointed up at the sky because a bright orange light had just appeared.  It was stationary for probably 5 seconds and then, almost like a firework, six more (though i'm not sure it was exactly six) orange lights emerged from the first light.  In fact, my first reaction was that it was a firework.  However, the lights did not descend, but instead remained in a V-like formation for a few additional seconds.  My friends and I immediately discussed whether it could be some strange firework, but came to the conclusion that it could not be for three reasons:   1)  The small number of lights and their duration were unlike any firework we had ever seen  2)  There was a firework show going on a few miles up the beach, and it was neither as bright nor did the tallest firework reach a quarter of the height of the orange lights and  3)  The lights were directly over the ocean and would have had to been fired from the water. It was then suggested that it was an airplane, but we didn't think it could be that.  Firstly, it didn't move or act like an airplane the sudden movements and sudden appearance of lights were unlike any airplane I have seen before.  And secondly, airplanes have red, green, and white lights while this aircraft had a single, bright orange light.  After several minutes of discussion, some of the lights suddenly appeared again, this time all at once and slightly south of their original position.  It did not appear, however, that the lights were all on the same shit as they seemed to move independantly, sometimes blinking and a few of them oscillating a bit. The final time we saw them was several more minutes later, much further down the beach.  They behaved in the same way, but appeared to have picked up speed.  They were only visible for a few seconds, and that was the last we saw of them.  The event has perplexed me as that same night I witnessed a shooting star, fireworks, a definite plane, and what we thought might even be a satelite- yet this was something completely different than any of those or anything I have ever seen.   Perhaps they were just fighter jets, but it didn't seem like it to me.  The unusual lights and the sporadic appearances have left me wondering what the source of these lights might have been.  After this, the moon had risen and my friends didn't share the same interest in the lights as I did and do, so we left the beach, but since that point i have been looking for some explanation.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
Two Orange Lights Over the Water;2007-01-29 19:00:00;40 Minutes;Two Orange Lights Over the Water Saw a very bright low light as I was traveling down the road at 6:50 pm.  Went to go pick up cousin and tell him.  Then went looking for it but couldn’t find it.  So, we went to Hagley Landing for a better view.  We arrived at about 7:05 pm, we saw the white/orange colored lights, not as bright as before.  The light seemed to be hovering in place but it seemed as if it was dropping extremely slow.  We could see a reflection of the light on the Waccamaw River and noticed that the reflection was decreasing in light.  We decided to leave because it was cold, then as we got into the truck and started to leave, out of nowhere another orange colored light was moving in a straight line from right to left until out of sight.   We get out of the truck once again and thought it might be an airplane but it didn’t have any blinking lights.  We looked over to the first light and noticed it was almost gone, behind the trees.  The whole event took place over 40 minutes.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
Orange glowing lights appearing & then fading away/White blinking objects moving across the sky freely;2009-10-08 20:30:00;one hour;Orange glowing lights appearing & then fading away/White blinking objects moving across the sky freely We saw bright orange lights appear - they seemed to be on fire or ignited. There were organized in a horizontal pattern. First there would be one light, then another. They were larger than stars, and were fully visible for about 3 full seconds before dimming and fading out. We saw a few formations of these lights, about 5 minutes apart and in all different areas of the sky. In total, I think we saw about 5 different appearances of these lights over the course of an hour. We also witnessed flickering/blinking lights directly after seeing the orange lights. These seemed to be moving independently and would cross the sky back and forth with no pattern at all. They seemed to be moving faster than an airplane, and had the ability to change direction or stay in one place. The flickering of these objects was white and seemed to have no constant, regular pattern. Although we were trying to get a better look at both of these strange lights through use of binoculars, they were both visible to the naked eye. This was the third night in a row I had witnessed the orange glowing lights, but the first time I had seen the blinking lights.

Bright lights seen off Pawleys Island SC;2012-07-18 22:00:00;30 minutes;Bright lights seen off Pawleys Island SC July 18 2012  Nine of us were on the beach at Pawley’s Island, SC around 2200 hrs.  We were sitting in a circle at the people facing the ocean saw several bright lights that came on suddenly, stayed on for 5-10 seconds and then faded.  Those of us with our backs to the ocean turned around and watched.  Over the next 30 minutes we saw them repeatedly. Sometimes there was just one and other times 2- 4 at a time.  One time three of them came on in a sequence moving left to right and then faded in the same pattern.  We probably saw 15-20 of them during that 30 minutes. The light was reddish yellow and came on intensely, stayed on for several seconds and then faded. There were some low clouds on the horizon and one time one lit up behind the cloud and gave the impression that it was a VERY intense light. These were located due east of the beach at about 25 degrees off the horizon. It was hard to tell how far away they were but probably 5-10 miles would be my guess. No aircraft were visible anywhere near the lights.  The nearest air bases are Shaw Air Force Base and Charleston Navel Air Station.  There was a southeasterly wind of about 15 mph. The lights did not appear to move in any direction while they were visible.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
Lights off coast at Pawleys Island, SC;2012-07-19 22:00:00;30 minutes;Lights off coast at Pawleys Island, SC July 19 2012  8 of use went back to the beach at Pawley’s Island, SC around 2200 hrs. We again saw intense lights out over the ocean.  Usually only 1 at a time.  However, once there were 4 in a row. They went out after about 10 seconds and then came back on 10 seconds later. This time they were closer together.   They went out and came back on again but this time there were only 2 and they were closer together than any of them had been before.  Over 30 minutes we saw about 10 of them. There were no aircraft in the area of the lights. They were due east of the beach and about 25 degrees above the horizon.  I would estimate that they were 5-10 miles off shore.  There was a southeastern breeze of about 15 mph.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998

The lights hung still in the air in a horizontal line formation without moving for about 10 seconds before disappearing.  This happened at least 6 times in a 15 minute period with different variations in number of lights.  The lights appeared over the ocean and did not have any trails like a flare or a Chinese lantern.  Others on the beach confirmed having seen the same light patterns. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998

Orange lights appeared over ocean off Litchfield Beach, SC;2014-06-23 20:00:00;15 minutes;Orange lights appeared over ocean off Litchfield Beach, SC Witnessed several groups of orange lights in sky over ocean at Litchfield Beach of Pawleys Island, SC.   At first, a group of orange lights appeared, flared then disappeared.  Next, a second group of 3-4 orange lights appeared, flared, then disappeared.   Next, two groups of several orange lights appeared close to each other in the same general area as the other two groups of lights.  The orange lights in the left group began to rotate in a line to its right (our left) and disappearing to the right (our left) as if the lights were rotating around a circular object and disappearing behind it.   Then these two groups of lights disappeared.   Next, two groups of orange lights appeared to our right what had to be several miles from where the original orange lights had appeared.  The timing and location of these groups of orange lights indicated that there was no humanly way that they could be the same orange lights as we had seen to our left.  These also flared and disappeared.   There were a couple more of sets of orange lights that appeared, flared, and disappeared in the same general area and to our right of where the last groups appeared before the event ended.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
