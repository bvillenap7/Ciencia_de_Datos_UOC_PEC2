Strange lights in sky over Pawleys Island.  ((NUFORC Note:  Many other sighting reports.  PD));2009-05-27 22:00:00;30 minutes;Strange lights in sky over Pawleys Island At approx 10pm my husband and I were on the beach at Litchfield resort looking skyward at the stars. Suddenly over the ocean horizon appeared a bright red/orange round glowing object which stayed brightly lit for about 10 seconds before disappearing. As we stared out over the horizon waiting to see it again, and about 4 min later, Two lights appeared same color/size as the first, next to each other like headlights from a car, they seemed to flicker a few times then disappeared at the same time.  They stayed lit about 20 seconds. About 10 minutes later, as we discussed what it could be, one light, same color appeared, then split in two  in a split second, horizontally, into equal sized round glowing objects stayed lit for maybe 15 seconds and disappeared at the same time.... at this point we knew it wasn't flares from a ship because the one light split into two horizontally not falling downward towards the ocean....we watched for about another 10 minutes then left the beach. Once we returned to our condo about 3/4 of a mile away we took the dogs out for a walk, and while looking skyward and discussing what we had seen, a pattern of  five white lights, which looked like stars from the brightness & color, began a flashing pattern.  Five lights in no particular arrangement flashing in a sequence... we heard the sound of aircraft but this was no normal plane(s) whatever it was, was flashing  separetly and too close for normal multiple aircraft to be next to each other. The flashing lights appeared to stay in the same spot in the sky. We speculated it could have been some type of military aircraft ( multiple ) flying in some formation. But the rumble we heard was no louder than a normal single plane. This flashing white light pattern lasted about 1 1/2 minutes.. then they disappeared. Not into the distance..they disappeared right where they were. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Three bright red lights in sky over the ocean at Pawley's Island, SC;2012-06-14 20:00:00;30 seconds;Three bright red lights in sky over the ocean at Pawleys Island, SC In the evening sky above the ocean at Pawley's Island on Thursday evening, June 14th, a bright red light appeared for several seconds above the ocean then disappeared.   Within a minute or so it reappeared, and within another few seconds one more bright red circle joined.   Both disappeared after a short period one showed up again and 2 more joined (one at a time) almost in a triangular shape.   All 3 could be seen at once and then were gone.   They were all very close to each other.  Thought it was a plane, but they came back.  Thought maybe it was a planet, but there was more than one.   Three other individuals were on the beach standing on the shoreline looking up which led me to believe they saw it too.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998

They suddenly disappeared without ever having changed position.  In the same direction as the red orbs that had just disappeared, a white strobe like light then flashed briefly but noticeably from horizon upward.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998

Small orb moving in erratic patterns;2019-11-28 08:43:00;45 minutes;Small orb moving in erratic patterns Our family was on the beach enjoying the evening when we noticed a light on the horizon. What drew our attention was the erratic movement of the small orb. It was white to orange in color. What drew our attention and held it was the erratic movement of the orb.  It would move left to right, up and down in jerky movement with no apparent rhythm or order.  It stayed in basically the sane location but would move in all directions and then come back.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
Orange lit circles appearing over the ocean off of Pawleys Island, South Carolina;2020-08-20 22:00:00;1 hour;Orange lit circles appearing over the ocean off of Pawleys Island, South Carolina While sitting on the widows watch on top of our rental house we witnessed what appeared to be four military aircraft flying at a high altitude above us coming from W headed E NE. They continued to fly in the same direction for five minutes making a large sweeping circle until coming back headed directly W passing almost directly back over top of us. About fifteen minutes after the military aircraft left our field of view the four of us observed two large orange circles appear in the sky to our ENE that stayed illuminated for roughly fifteen seconds.  The two circles were side by side with one slightly higher than the other and almost appeared to be angled down to the ocean. We waited and watched in the same direction to see if anything reappeared and we then noticed two military aircraft coming from our W again but this time traveling at the same altitude but at a much higher rate of speed. The two aircraft passed directly over top of us again and headed towards the ocean and started to veer ENE in the direction of where the two circles had appeared. While heading in that direction the two circles appeared again blocking out the light from the military aircraft. We then continued watching the sky towards the E to see if we saw anything else.  We continued watching for another half hour but never saw the circles again.  We did witness the military aircraft making passes back and forth up and down the beach line, but well out over the ocean, and on one pass multiple other aircraft joined into the existing two aircraft.  When we came off of the widows watch the military aircraft were still making passes up and down the beach line. This same event has happened every night we have been here but this is the first night I have gotten to witness the event.  It is never the same amount of lights and they appear in different spots in the sky for different durations.  Another member of our party posted a report from earlier this week of their sighting.  We have tried to debunk the lights as flares but the light never moves like a flare would in the sky.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
