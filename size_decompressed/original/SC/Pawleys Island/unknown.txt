A shaft of light from the sky.;2007-06-15 22:00:00;about 1 min.;A shaft of light from the sky. I was standing on my back porch, and my husband was in the kitchen. I saw a shaft of pure white light, about 4ft in diameter, shine down in my back yard.  I called my husband to come see. He took his time walking, and the light disappeared by the time he stepped beside me.  There was no sound, so I know it wasn't a man made aircraft.   I was too scared to step into the yard to look up and see what it was.  This is my second experience with something this scary, and I did not want to find out what the light was.   I still can remember that light.  It is something I will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides little contact information.

It caught up to other plane and stalled for a few seconds and then went in a forward then stall pattern a few times across the ski.  During the forward movement, it only took a second to move great distance.  Always wanted to see something like this!  I now believe !  Thx ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
