High altitude fast moving object becomes stationary over Pawleys Island for over 30 minutes.;2014-08-11 21:00:00;30 minutes;High altitude fast moving object becomes stationary over Pawleys Island for over 30 minutes Saw a light come very fast from the direction of the ocean.  I thought it might be a satellite as that was about the height it seemed to be.  It then came to a complete halt and stayed stationary for 30 minutes or more.   It was bright like a star but seemed to blink a series of colors.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
