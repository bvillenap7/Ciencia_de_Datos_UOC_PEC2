While watching tv with the porch door open, noticed one large bright oval light with three smaller ones to the side all aligned over the condos near the pier at Pawleys Island.  They vanished from the bottom to the top all aligned.  At first I thought it was the moon (???) and clouds but it was a very clear night with lots of stars in the sky.  The siting did not last very long.  By the time I told my husband to look they had vanished.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
