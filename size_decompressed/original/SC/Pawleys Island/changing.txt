Mysterious orange lights and apparent military search over Pawleys Island, SC.;2020-08-17 22:00:00;1 hour;Mysterious orange lights and apparent military search over Pawleys Island, SC. The event started with two orange lights that randomly appeared out over the water which quickly faded out.  Within 10-15 minutes, more orange lights appeared further north up the coast, but this time there were four separate lights that seemed to be stationary in a diamond pattern.  Just as quickly as the lights appeared they disappeared just as the first two had. This is where things really got interesting.  After about 10 minutes we noticed a line of white lights appear and they continued to move north towards our location.  As the line of white lights approached it was determined that this line of white lights was a group of around 10-15 military jets.  While closing in on the location of the first witnessed orange lights the jets proceeded to scatter and start what could only be described as a search flight pattern.  After roughly 15 minutes of the search flight pattern the jets reformed into a line and departed south back from the direction that they appeared from. Finally once the military jets were no longer in sight another craft(s) appeared but much closer to our location.  Once again it was either four orange lights in a diamond formation but we were in able to determine if they were four individual crafts or one large one with four lights.  Either way the four lights showed up and blinked off twice to finish the event.;33.4498999999998;-79.1359999999998
