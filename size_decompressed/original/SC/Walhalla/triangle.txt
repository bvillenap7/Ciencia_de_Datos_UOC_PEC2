3 very bright non flashing white lights in a triangle formation moving slowing from west to North East w/no sound.;2011-03-18 20:40:00;1 minute;3 very bright non flashing white lights in a triangle formation moving slowing from west to North East w/no sound. At approximate 9:40pm on March 18, 2011 I was out taking pictures of the moon and noticed what I thought was 3 bright white stars moving to the NE in formation.  They were in a pattern like a triangle so it was either 3 UFOs or one in a triangle shape.  They were moving very, very slowly through the trees but high above from West to North East.  There was no sound and no flashing lights.  A plane was coming from the North East to the west and the UFOs or UFO was above the airplane.  I had my camera and took a picture and the minute I did and looked, all three of the lights had disappeared.  When I took the picture it was against a dark side of the sky and many pine trees so after enlarging it, I did not see anything.   This ends my report.
