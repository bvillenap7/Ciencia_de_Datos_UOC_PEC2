Approx. 30 lights, in two groups, flying in a 'V' formation.;2014-06-07 21:30:00;10-15 minutes;Approx. 30.lights in two groups flying in a 'V' formation Driving west on #9 Bypass, I looked out of the passenger side window and saw multiple lights in the sky.  My husband pulled over so we could get a better look.  From our perspective, the lights were in the north and appeared to travel in a north westerly direction.  Each light seemed to consist of three red lights, with the center light pulsing. We watched for approximately 10-15 minutes as two groups of 12-15 lights each passed by and eventually disappeared behind clouds.  They weren’t moving extremely fast, but they were not slow either.  My husband noted that each group appeared to be moving in a “V” formation.;34.7487;-80.7595000000001
