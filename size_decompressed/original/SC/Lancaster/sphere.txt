Vibrating bright white ball of jello 50 feet wide.;2017-12-21 21:00:00;5 minutes;Vibrating bright white ball of jello 50 feet wide. I live approximately 20 miles south east of Charlotte Douglas international Airport.  I am an amateur astronomer and have a fairly large telescope.  Being so close to the airport there are passenger jets that flight continuously from 6 AM until 12 PM daily.  Over the past couple of months, I’ve seen this object three times, and I did manage to capture a video with my cell phone but it’s hard to see.  I did buy a Samsung HD video camera just so that I can capture this object on video.  The really strange thing about it is it flies slowly over our neighborhood and the only way I can describe how it looks is like a jiggly ball of bright white vibrating jello.   Do you want another interesting thing is since I started seeing these there of been Apache attack helicopters fly over our neighborhood periodically, maybe three times per month and just the other day they came down over our neighborhood just above the tops of the houses like they were chasing something.;34.7487;-80.7595000000001
