I told my son and he looked in the wrong direction.  I told him it was over this way and pointed at it he looked where I was pointing and pointed at they one he saw.  They were identical in every way including speed.  I can't say whether they made a sound or not because as far away as they were we wouldn't have been able to hear them anyway. I am 62 and my son is 28.  I have always studied the sky with and without my telescope and I have never seen anything like this.                           In my opinion I would say these objects were not in earth's atmosphere.  When I saw the first one I thought it might possibly be the space station, but when he showed me the second one, I knew that wasn't the case.;34.7487;-80.7595000000001
