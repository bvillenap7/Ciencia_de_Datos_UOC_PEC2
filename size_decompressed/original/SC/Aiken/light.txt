Another one of the same comes back 30 minutes later. disappears. A VERY bright red light was observed traveling from approximately South East to North West at (8:45 PM).  This was against the wind currents at that time and no cloud cover.  The light was of greater intensity than any current star, planet, or aircraft typically sighted at this time of year and did NOT change color, shape, size or speed during the duration.  As if someone lit a roadflare and flown it across the sky.  A video of the object was made but is grainy, not really showing anything useful and no where near as bright as the object appeared to be. No sound was observed coming from the direction of the object.  As the object got closer, it was going to go into an area that was obstructed by trees in my yard.  Once it became obscured, it disappeared.  I visibly scanned the area for several minutes from different perspectives to see if the object had changed direction or intensity in light but never saw anything else.  The amount of time from when the object was spotted to when it was lost or disappeared was around 1 minute or so. Approximately 30 minutes later, at  2115 (9:15 PM), the object, or another one just like it, reappeared in the same area/location as the first one and traveled in approximately the same direction/speed as the original( horizon to very close to my location).  It had the same color and intensity as the original one 30 minutes prior.  I first observed the second object from the same location as the first, and it to, was in the process of being obscured by the treeline.  I moved very quickly to change perspective in order to continue observing the object.  This change in one location to another was less than three seconds.  Again, during that change in vantage point, the object disappeared in the same spot as the first one.  Again, a visual scan from multiple vantage points within several seconds of the disappearance yielded nothing, no other aircraft in the area, no sounds of any kind from the object, no change in surroundings.  A continued visual scan of all surroundings for the nex! t hour Clouds moved in from opposite direction) yielded no further sitings.  No video was taken of second object.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
Fast moving bright blue orb/ball of light;2016-12-28 04:30:00;3 seconds;Fast moving bright blue orb/ball of light In the early morning, while still dark, a very bright blue orb-like ball crossed the sky.  It was very low and close to our car.  It moved very fast, lasted for approximately 3 seconds, and then completely disappeared.  I was not a believer before today but am convinced that the object was a space craft of sorts.  The second observer is educated on this subject yet still could not believe what he had just witnessed.  Definitely a little frightening.  Left us feeling very confused and amazed.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
