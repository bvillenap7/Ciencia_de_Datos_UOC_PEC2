Unknown Slow Pulsing Light object moving accross I-20;2003-01-10 19:30:00;30 min.;Unknown Slow Pulsing Light object moving accross I-20 We were driving from Augusta, Ga. to Aiken S.C. on US I-20 around 07:30 EST. Crossing above the interstate moving in a North-North West direction was an unknown object this was at the first Aiken exit on I-20. The shape of object seemed long due to the pulsing lights along the side of the craft. We turned off on SC highway 19 to the south and stopped just a short ways down the road. I observed this object for around 30 minutes in a stationary position. After approx. 30 min's the object moved toward the north very slowly. One small aircraft was around as if their were watching it, but not getting to close. At least it seem that way due to the path the smaller Airplane was flying.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
Small, rapid blinking, fast moving lights.;2016-07-26 23:10:00;1 minute;small, rapid blinking, fast moving lights. My boyfriend and I were sitting on our front porch when he pointed out these rapidly flashing lights in the sky.  There seemed to be 3 rows of 2.  There was no sound at all. We live near an airport and would immediately recognize a typical aircraft.  They were traveling west to east.  At one point it seemed the first two lights slowed, almost like they were waiting on the others to catch up.  But, that did not happen.  They continued blinking rapidly and moving until they were just gone.  The lights were so small and fast at first I thought it was fireflies. I really would like to know.  My boyfriend has told me before he has seen this. I thought he was crazy, until now.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
