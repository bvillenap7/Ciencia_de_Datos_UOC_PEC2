Black circle in sky over a lake;2008-08-01 00:00:00;10 SECONDS;Black circle in sky over a lake While fishing at a private lake my son took a picture of a single black circle that appeared in the sky in front of a cloud.  He said it stayed at the same spot for about 10 seconds and then zoomed off extremely fast. After looking at the picture he took enlarged several times, it appears to be a complete black circle outlined with a purplish blue light surrounding it. There was only 1 circle that appeared and the only other things in the sky at that time were clouds and a few geese off to the left side, but not near the circle. We have a photo of this circle on my cell phone.  I would need to send it to you in a text message.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
Sphere UFO sighted on ISS live stream.;2016-10-15 02:30:00;<1 minute;Sphere UFO sighted on ISS live stream. While watching the ISS live feed on youtube, I saw a bright white sphere in the distance.  It was too small and too close to the Earth to be the moon, but seemed to be very large.  It was not there one moment.  I looked down to read the chat, then I looked up a few seconds later it was there.  It was very far away at the horizon moving away, and moved past the horizon in probably 10-20 seconds.  It was either metallic and shining or bright white.  Only two other people said they saw it.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
Bright Sphere;2020-01-16 23:00:00;5 minutes;Bright Sphere Sitting on my patio approximately 11PM. Noticed a bright, round light 'hovering' over the trees across the golf course in the back of my house. It got dimmer after 5 minutes... then about a minute later it came back brighter than when I first saw it. Soon after it appeared again, it took off very fast - in an upward, Northwestern direction... then it disappeared!;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
