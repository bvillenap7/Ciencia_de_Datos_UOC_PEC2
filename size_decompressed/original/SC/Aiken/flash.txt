Very eerie....;2015-10-18 06:30:00;20 minutes;Very eerie .... Looked like a star but it was smaller and moving like it was rising above other stars in the distance.  Then below it around the other stars I saw flashes of like.  Sort of blurry flashes of that makes sense.   Lasted for a while during 6:30 am.  It was still dark here at that time.  Tried to get my iPhone to take pic and video, but all all I saw was the gate I was behind and darkness.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177

I am very sure I saw lights moving very r Saw a small orange light that flashed intermittently, while traveling very fast (much faster than a commercial jet) west to East in the Southern sky, but also moving up and down.  Each time it flashed, it was above or below the horizontal axis of its travel.   I observed it and immediately called my wife, who saw it but only just before it went out of sight, blocked by the roof of our house.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
