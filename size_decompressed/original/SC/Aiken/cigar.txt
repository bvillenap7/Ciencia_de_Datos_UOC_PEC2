Clearly visible metallic cigar shaped craft hovering above densely wooded area at night 75 yards away;2007-11-09 01:30:00;15 minutes;Clearly visible metallic cigar shaped craft hovering above densely wooded area at night 75 yards away My girlfriend and I were driving back to her house around 1:30 am.  She lives in a heavily wooded area.   As we were driving we rounded a curve and to our left just above the tree-line, no more than 75 yards away, was a clearly visible cigar shaped craft.  It had four square shaped white lights evenly spaced on its top half. The entire craft had a soft metallic glow.   I estimate that it was 15 feet long. No wings. No vapor trail. No sound.  The area below it is was nothing but trees. We continued to drive a short distance then turned around.  This time it had sunk slightly below the tree-line.  We turned around once again headed back toward her house.  As we passed the third time only the very top of it was visible above the trees.  We continued to her house which is about 5 minutes away.  We stayed there for about 30 minutes discussing what had just occurred.   We decided to go back and see if the craft was still there.  We passed by the spot that we saw it numerous more times, but could not see anything.  It possibly could have landed or moved on. The trees were too dense to see very far.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
