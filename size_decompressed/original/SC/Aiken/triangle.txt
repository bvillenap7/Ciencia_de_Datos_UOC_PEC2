Triangle shaped object moved slowly with no sound.;2010-04-13 08:30:00;30 seconds;Triangle shaped object moved slowly with no sound. Last night (4/13/2010) at around 8:30, my wife and I were sitting outside looking at the stars. I happened to notice an object moving across the sky and for a split-second thought it was a plane. I very quickly realized that it was not a plane. This object was traveling from east to west and made no sound.  It was 3 white lights in a triangle pattern.  I called out for my teen son and he witnessed it also.  We stood in awe as we watched this object slowly move across the sky.  It made a very sharp turn back in our direction then just as quickly turned back to the original course.  It faded in the distance with a sighting time of about 30 sec. total. I could not tell the shape of the object, just the pattern of the lights. I also could not judge the size but would guess it was smaller than a commercial airliner but bigger than a Cessna.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
