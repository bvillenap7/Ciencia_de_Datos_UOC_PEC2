Straight-line flight with no visible wings or no vapor trail.;2004-11-18 11:30:00;2 Minutes;Straight-line flight with no visible wings or no vapor trail. Straight-line flight from Nw to SE silver no visible wings no vapor trail no discernable sound. As it passed beneath the dispersed contrail of a jet, but appeared to be at some altitude(maybe 10,000-15,000 feet?). Object was 8 or 10 times longer than wide. The rate of passage from my perspective was similar to a jet airplane, but the impression was that it was not being propelled so much as gliding. This was observered on the Savannah River Site.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
