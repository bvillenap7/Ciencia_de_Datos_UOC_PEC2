Silver cylindrical object no wings no vapor trail no sound .;2004-11-18 11:30:00;2 min's;Silver cylindrical object no wings no vapor trail no sound . Straight-line flight from NW to SE silver no visible wings no vapor trail no discernable sound. It passed beneath the dispersed contrail of a jet, but appeared to be at some altitude, maybe 10,000-15,000 feet. Object was about 8 times longer than wide. The rate of passage from my perspective was similar to a jet airplane, but the impression was that it was not being propelled so much as gliding and their were no noise. Weather condition were Clear. This Occured Over the Savannah River Site which is approx. 16 miles south of Aiken SC.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
Orb with orange glow;2013-07-04 21:00:00;1 minute;Orb with orange glow I dont know how long it stayed there because I was driving down the road but I was able to slow enough to get a short video.  I am very skeptical but I honestly have not idea what was in the sky last night.   It had a orange glow from it and it was not quite as high as the clouds.  I was moving slowly so i could not tell for sure if it was stationary or moving.;33.5334544117647;-81.6955602941177
