Slow moving craft;2003-08-28 13:30:00;3 minutes;Slow moving craft Tie craft was white, basically a cylander but had knobbly projections at either end.  What caught my eye was the slowness of the object's forward motion.  I don't think it was moving forward fast enough to maintain loft.  As I watched, I noticed that the object did not have any part that reflected any shine, although it was a bright sunny day. It passed into a white cloud and came out the other side. I watched until it became obscured by trees.Object left no trail at any time.;33.1218;-79.509
