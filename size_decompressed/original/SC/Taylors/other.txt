Airplane shaped aircraft motionless in the air.;2009-12-06 12:00:00;6 hours;Airplane shaped aircraft motionless in the air. On my way to church, I saw a thing that looked like a commercial airplane about 2,000 feet in the sky. It was motionless, it wasn't moving at all. It wasn't moving even while we were stopped at the stop light, but it was pointed forward. I don't beleive in UFOs, but this was really weird and I think it was something of the sort. My brother who is ten saw it too. My dad saw it but fails to admit it. It looked like a black plane. 2 hours later, after church, we were coming back and it was in the EXACT same position. It was definatly shaped like a plane, like a commercial airliner, but it's impossible for those to hover. Later that night there were lights where it had been, but then they vanished. While I was trying to take a picture of the aircraft, my phone wouldn't turn on until we started moving again.

Large spheres of light making formations across the sky with flickering lights coming and going.;2012-09-12 21:15:00;1-2 hours;Large spheres of light making formations across the sky with flickering lights coming and going. A friend and I were on her back patio and the stars looked extremely close.  We began to notice some getting bigger and flickering.  Most were spheres of light that would make different formations as if they were working together.  Some appeared suddenly in the shape of a triangle and different colored flickering lights.  Some appeared suddenly down low through the trees and vanished suddenly.   There were different size circles of light. Some appeared blue, some appeared reddish orange and some were white and then faded in and out. One was moving in a circular motion repeatedly.  Some would shoot down beams of light. It appeared to be several as if they were hovering and working together to create some type of formation.;34.9273999999999;-82.3186000000001
Bright, white, elongated object moving at super-fast speed.;2013-09-28 19:30:00;3 seconds;Bright, white, elongated object moving at super-fast speed. Date of sighting:  09/28/2013 Time of sighting:  between 7:30 and 7:45 pm Location of sighting:  Taylors, South Carolina  Two of my sisters and I were sitting on a bench on a screened porch watching the sunset. We saw a large, elongated object emerge from a group of trees.  The object was similar in size to a large passenger plane.  It was traveling from North-West to South-East. It immediately caught our attention because it was bright white (similar to the bright- ness of the moon) and completely illuminated.  There were not any flashing lights or any colored lights. The front was larger and tapered off at the back.  It was traveling much faster than any type of plane any of us had ever seen.  The house is very close to the Greenville-Spartanburg airport so we are used to seeing planes go over.  The object disappeared behind a tree but we never saw it emerge on the other side. We were shaken up because of the speed it was traveling seemed abnormal.  Approximately 15 to 20 minutes after the sighting, we saw a plane emerge from the same group of trees and take the same flight path.  This was what we normally see.  Red and white lights and traveling at a normal speed.  This plane disappeared behind the same tree but emerged on the other side.  All Three witnesses are female siblings, ages 50, 64 and 66.;34.9273999999999;-82.3186000000001
