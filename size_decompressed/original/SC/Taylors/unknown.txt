I was watching t.v. at my house.  I got up to get something out of my car.  My neighborhood is somewhat rural, not a lot of people around.  I live at the end of  a cul-de-sac.  I looked up in the sky as I was going to my car, and saw two lights going in the same direction, but they were connected. It looked kind of like two airplanes in formation at first.  There were other planes flying in the area (I live near an airport).  There were some stars showing and it was partly cloudy. The object floated about 10 â€“ 20 mph if had to guess, and was maybe two football fields in length (no sound).(guessing)it floated into the clouds, and that was the last I saw of it.  If I were to guess, I would guess it was a blimp, but it  seemed to go into the clouds sideways.  Thanks for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting was flawed.  We assume the witness implies a date of November 25, and we have altered the report.  PD));34.9273999999999;-82.3186000000001
