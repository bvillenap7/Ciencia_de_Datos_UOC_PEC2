All of the lights were the exact same color of orange and came individually, then in pairs, one shortly behind the other and then at the end three of them together, one behind the other.   These orange lights followed the exact same trajectory moving from west to east and were slightly to our south.  These lights all stayed solid and non blinking lights, and appear to move at the same speed.  At no time were we able to viable see any shape to these objects, other than the solid orange light, nor could we distinguish and audible sound from them.   We live near the GSP airport and are very familiar with aircraft flying over, these were nothing like we have ever witnessed.  And they seemed to be lower than what we normally will see, although it was had to tell for certain because it was very dark and we couldn't see a solid shape to estimate distance.   Halfway through the event my son called a friend who lives within 10 miles SW of us, his friend and his friend's wife we able to witness these lights as well.  However for them they saw the formations roughly a minute before we did and the saw them towards towards their north and moving still from west to east.;34.9273999999999;-82.3186000000001
20 odd orange lights in Taylors, SC.;2016-01-03 20:30:00;15 minutes;20 odd orange lights in Taylors, SC. We saw about 20 orangish/reddish lights hovering over E North St and we thought they looked weird.  So we pulled over, and then they started moving ENE, and they all moved away.   We pulled over and they were gone except one that went right over our head and then disappeared into the clouds. Very quiet and very strange! ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above.
