Four or five  yellow glowing balls of light;2003-08-21 22:40:00;1-2 min.;Four or five  yellow glowing balls of light While locking our car for the night,around 10:40 p.m., in our hotel parking lot located along the beach, I happened to look up at the stars and noticed a red light moving quickly overhead, eastward,into the dark ocean sky. When, what I believed to be an airplane suddenly had four or five yellow glowing balls of light appear one at a time behind it, in a line. I told my wife to look, which she did. We both watched the balls of light seem to hang in the air and then disappear several seconds later. All I could think is they were signal flares,she was unsure. Before the balls of light had disappeared the red light had changed course and sped out of sight to the south at the same high rate of speed. There were other people walking along the beach and fishing on a public fishing pier nearby who must have seen the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the report is not inconcistent with a military jet releasing flares of some variety, perhaps the type designed to confuse an infra-red- homing anti-aircraft missile.  However, it would be unusual for an aircraft to do that over a populated area, we believe, unless the flares were released accidently.  PD));32.6658;-79.9298
Multiple orangish points of light, turning on and off in a random pattern.;2016-04-18 20:38:00;15 minutes;Multiple orangish points of light, turning on and off in a random pattern. My wife, 2 kids, and I all saw multiple points of light, mostly stationary, but turning on and off in a random pattern.  First 1-2, then up to 6 or 7, then back to 2, then none.   About 5 minutes later several would reappear.  They all had an orangeish color, unlike stars.  They appeared off the eastern coast of Folly Beach, SC.;32.6658;-79.9298
Orange orbs over the ocean at night, every 20-25 min, some grouped and some individual;2019-07-30 22:00:00;Variable;Orange orbs over the ocean at night, every 20-25 min, some grouped and some individual My wife and I were stargazing near the water on a clear night.  There was light cloud cover and a storm very far out to sea. Our first sighting was what appeared to be 5 orange lights, all in a row parallel to the horizon, slipping from behind a cloud, moving out and around the cloud, then moving back into the cloud and fading.  This occurred in the skies south of our position.  Total visible time was about 10-12 seconds. These objects were circular, with a slight twinkle to them.  The hue was definitely a bright orange, almost yellow toward the middle when they were at their brightest. Throughout the night we saw several single flashes of orange light.  The flashes were primarily located in the south eastern sky and only lasted a moment.  They resembled jet engines, but we heard no sounds that might indicate military aircraft. Our second sighting, coming just before returning to our house, was of a long string of orbs that seemed to extend/“come from” a single orb that appeared/“turned on” first and began to move slowly.  The orbs moved in unison and were bright enough that the orange light they gave off reflected on the ocean surface.  Again, they faded into clouds and were gone.  Total visible time was again about 10-12 seconds.;32.6658;-79.9298
Approx. y 40 white lights in a straight line moving from right to left all disappearing at a certain point.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-28 21:30:00;3 minutes;Approximately 40 white lights in a straight line moving from right to left all disappearing at a certain point. We saw approximately 40 white lights, perfectly spaces in a perfect straight line, cruising across the sky.  They all would get to a certain point and disappear.  These lights were between us and the big dipper.  There were 4 of us, all sitting around the fire when my friend looked up and said, “what ((deleted)) is that?”  The objects were moving from left to right.  The whole thing lasted about 3 minutes.  Speculation was 4 things drones, satellites, high altitude night jumps or UFO’s.;32.6658;-79.9298
