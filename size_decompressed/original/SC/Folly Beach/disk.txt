I was in the Hotel parking lot at my hotel and I saw a big saucer go over the hotel over the ocean and it was red lighted and had pink in the middle of it. It went over the ocean.  I went out on the public pier and I still saw it.  There were people walking along the beach as well.  I was with a friend we walked back from the pier to the hotel parking lot and we still saw it way out over the sea.   Then we lost sight of the object.  Other people on the beach and the pier must have saw it.  It was 10:40 P.M. on 11-22-2005 when we saw this saucer over the hotel and pier.;32.6658;-79.9298
