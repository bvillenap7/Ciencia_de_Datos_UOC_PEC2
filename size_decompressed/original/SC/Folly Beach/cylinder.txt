Orange light with red outline moving north;2012-01-01 22:01:00;10 sec.;orange light with red outline moving north I took my dog outside and was sitting on my front steps waiting for him to finish his business, when a Reddish orange light, rectangular in shape flew across the sky overhead, heading north. It did not seem like a firework, plane or helicopter . It was silent. Can't really say how high it was, but It didn't seem as high as a jet.  I jumped up and walked out to the street to follow its track, but it was soon obscured by trees.  Im not sure if my memory is correct, but I think it was red on the edges and orange toward the center. Hope someone else saw it.;32.6658;-79.9298
