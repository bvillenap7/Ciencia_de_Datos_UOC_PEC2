teardrop shape, bright, lime-green glowing orb;2001-06-16 22:30:00;1-3 seconds;teardrop shape, bright, lime-green glowing orb Last Saturday night, my wife and I were sitting on a porch looking out at the ocean.  We suddenly saw a teardrop shape, lime green lighted orb zip down toward the water.  It began at about a 50 degree position in the sky, streaking north to south very quickly, and diappeared just before hitting the water.  We didn't see any splash at all, and its impossible for me to judge the distance.  It was about the size of a B-B, but light up the cloud cover behind it to about dime size.  It lasted about 1-2 seconds.  My wife saw the last part of it out of the corner of her eye, but I happened to be looking in that direction at the time it began.  This was very, very, odd.  I've never seen anything like it.  It did not change color, and did not change directions.  I do not mind being contacted, but I'd like to remain anonymous.  I am a Professor in a very conservative little school in the CHarleston area.;32.6658;-79.9298
