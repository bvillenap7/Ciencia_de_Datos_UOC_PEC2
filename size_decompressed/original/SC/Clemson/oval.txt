My friend (24, student) and I (26, job searching) were driving home on January 15, 2008 at around 2:30 in the morning. It was a clear, starry night. I was talking to him, when from the Corner of my eye I saw a round/oval shape of light shooting by. This only lasted for 2 to 3 seconds. We were moving east at the time.  It was about the size of a headlight of a car, maybe even bigger and it was radiating a very bright light. I would say the light had a color between yellow and orange. The object radiated those 2 colors intermittently (You can compare it to a star blinking in the sky.) The object was moving downwards choosing a curved path. It looked like it was going to land, but we can't be sure of this. The object then disappeared behind the tree line. There was no sound whatsoever.  I was about to say to him: “look a shooting star”. But because of the size of the object I don’t think it was a shooting star. Then he asked me if I just saw that, I answered yes, and we compared our sightings. We came to the conclusion that we both saw the same thing and that it wasn’t a shooting star or a plane.;34.6819192307692;-82.8277076923076
