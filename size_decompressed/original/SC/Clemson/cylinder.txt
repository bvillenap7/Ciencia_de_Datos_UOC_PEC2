Observed large bright orange fiery object over Clemson SC night sky near midnight.;2011-09-24 23:20:00;3 minutes;Observed large bright orange fiery object over Clemson SC night sky near midnight. One large object fiery orange in color almost appeared to be on fire or burning up.  Object traveled west/northwest rapidly across night sky - very bright and large at first and then dwindled in size as it moved across the sky.   Uncertain if this was due to distance (moving away) or actual burning up in the atmosphere.   We observed this from the Clemson, South Carolina area near the football stadium.;34.6819192307692;-82.8277076923076
