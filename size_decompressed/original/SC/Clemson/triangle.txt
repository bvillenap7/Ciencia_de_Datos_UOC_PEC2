A girlfriend and I were arguing on Clemson Campus, it was sunset.  I looked and spotted a trinagular craft, with a circle in it's center.  The circle had lights on it's edge and seemed to rotate in a clockwise rotation where the triangle did not.  I made my girlfriend at the time look and see it as well.  The craft circled a bit and seemed to hover near the Death Valley football field's lights, which were on for a game the next day.  It was friday, and games were on Saturday.  After she saw it, and asked me what it was,  I said I didn't know and it either dissappeared, or accellerated way quickly enough that I could no longer see it.   1991 was before the internet, but I have never forgotten this incident.  I mentioned this on /UFO on the IRC once and was advised to report it then,  but I chickened out.  But after years of looking at UFO pics,  I have never seen one that resembled what I saw.
