I was driving down Hwy 123, coming into Clemson.  I was looking at the sky admiring the night clouds when I saw a bright orange light come from nowhere and start flying across the sky.  It was going extremely fast, and it flew parallel to the horizon.   After about 5 seconds, it sped up even more and disappeared into the open sky, almost comparable warp drive from star trek.;34.6819192307692;-82.8277076923076
