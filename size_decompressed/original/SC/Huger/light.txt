High red lights moving accross sky;2010-10-18 05:00:00;15 seconds;High red lights moving accross sky 	When returning to bed after early morning trip to bathroom I noticed two 	small red lights in the sky through upper section of bedroom window. 	They moved one following behind the other, at some distance apart and 	very high in altitude, possibly orbital as their speed appeared similar to 	passing satelite or orbital station. Just before the two red lights passed 	out of view (blocked by edge of window) the lights turned from red to pink 	to white almost instantly. Then I saw two more red lights traveling along 	the same path but far behind the original lights. These new lights seemed 	to be alongside each other, possibly on the same object. They seemed 	to fade out before leaving field of view.   	** 									*	*;33.0488;-79.7864
