I turned around and to my amazement there was something crazy in the sky it was almost as big as the Sun.  I thought it was a meteor going to hit the earth.   But then it stopped and turned at a 90 degree angle.;34.1327000000001;-81.3361000000003
Bright light in distance moved about mostly stationary early morning hours 1/06/18.;2018-01-06 05:15:00;~30 minutes;Bright light in distance moved about mostly stationary early morning hours 1/06/18 Bright light in long distance SW from my home moved about in early morning hours. In the early morning hours of January 6, 2018, I got up to go to the bathroom.  I then looked out a back window to the view over our lakeside home (Lake Murray near Chapin, SC).  I viewed the lake and sky.  I saw a bright light in the sky, larger than visible stars.  It was not the moon!  I watched for a period of time and it did seem to move a bit downward and to the right.  I observed for a period of time to ensure this was not an airplane or jet (or normal one at least).  This viewing was approximately 5:00 a.m. and in a SW direction from the back of our home.  Distance could not be determined - it seemed to be a good distance away. After observing for a period of time, I got my Panasonic DMC-FZ70 and took pictures through our windows - it was very cold outside.  As I recall, there was no moon visible.  I took a series of pictures from 5:15 a.m. to 5:24 a.m. Of course, at first, I thought my eyes or imagination were playing tricks on me.  But, I really believe I observed something really unusual.  I called for my wife to get up, but, she refused.  I continued to watch to about 5:30 a.m. and then went back to bed.  When I quit viewing, the strange light was still visible. I had thought about calling the Lexington County Sheriff's Department at the time of sighting or at least the next morning, but, I did not do this. Today, on January 18, 2018, I finally downloaded pictures from my camera.  I had forgotten about these pictures.  I do have a collection of 15 pictures - this camera has a relatively long focal length and some are at 215mm.  Upon seeing these pics, I wondered what to do about this and I did a google search and found this website and amazingly found another report for that same day in South Carolina.  However, that report was for some type of similar sighting that night. (1/6/18 19:30)  In summary, I saw a very bright light, that to me was NOT a star or a normal airplane.  It did appear to move about in a generally small area.;34.1327000000001;-81.3361000000003
