Fiery Orange Ball Slowly Moving over our house at Lake Murray, SC;2012-03-11 20:45:00;3 minutes;Fiery Orange Ball Slowly Moving over our house at Lake Murray, SC My husband had gone outside to feed the dog and heard a “rumble” and looked up.  Above our house moving very slowly was an extremely large (as big as our house), fiery orange, round ball.  The night sky was clear. It appeared close to us (500 feet or less).  The rumble was only heard for approximately 2-3 seconds.  I was on the other side of the house when he started shouting, “Look up, look up!!”  We watched it for 2-3 minutes as it headed northwest.  It had no tail. It was definitely not an airplane.;34.1327000000001;-81.3361000000003
Same UFOs observed in South Carolina as seen in Ohio over Lake Erie.;2018-05-04 21:00:00;1+ hour;Same UFOs observed in South Carolina as seen in Ohio over Lake Erie. I witnessed a bizarre event on Friday May 4, 2018, in the South Western sky, along with several relatives, between 8:45PM and 10:00PM EST. in Chapin, South Carolina 29036.  It involved up to seven [7] multicolored [red, blue, green, white and yellow] round entities along with a transforming white mother ship (?) having 5 retangular windows.  The multiple colored UFOs are in the Lake Erie, Ohio, videos and seem to be exact duplicates to what has been seen in other states and countries and London, England.  They were also here on 09May2018. The entities were NOT stars, as all five colors were visible with binoculars at the same time and they would flash their colors at random like a police car.  The binoculars are powerful enough to see Jupiter's moons.  Two were following the mother ship [pictures attached] then stopped.  That's when bursts of energy like heat lightening were seen [flash] in outer space.   What happened next was and is the real story and all of us saw the same thing.  The multicolored entities were zig zaging all over the place as if they were controlled by a mouse on a PC.  Up, down, left, right, diagonally and rotationally.  Days after I thought about it and could have it been a war in space?  At first we thought that the white light was a planet or the International Space Station.  That's when I took a look at the white object with binoculars and saw what I perceived as five horizontal retangular windows.  They were black like a human DNA chart.  The others also looked at the objects with the binoculars and they all confirmed as to what I saw.  What we witnessed was so bizarre we thought it was possibly a Holographic image, laser or military aircraft but they were way too far out in space.  We also had two commercial jets fly over [9:45PM-10:00PM]  while all of this was happening and the entities were way above the jets. My IQ is 88 percentile.  Others included a Corporate Comptroller and an Anesthesiologist among others.  I am retired and have been in the public arena having appeared on CNN in 1990.  I was part of the #1 ongoing investigation among all Federal agencies back in the day for several years.  It was important enough that President Regan was given a daily briefing on same until it was sanitized by the Feds. Let's see if this email makes it to you and can your steer us to what we possibly witnessed.;34.1327000000001;-81.3361000000003
