Two balls of light beneath the tree canopy swoop over my car and vanish.;1992-06-25 12:30:00;3 to 5 min.;Two balls of light beneath the tree canopy swoop over my car and vanish. I would have reported this before now, but didn't know of this site until today.  Well, I was driving to the store late one night. At the time I was living in the country, well away from any town. The road that I had to travel to the store was covered by tree canopy.  As I was on my way, a vehicle was coming towards me.  I noticed that it had two lights above it.  I thought it was a 4x4 truck with the spot lights on the roof turned on.   To my amazement it was a car with two balls of light above the roof.  When the car passed me the balls of light swooped over my windshied and vanished.  At that instant my car's engine quit and the car that passed me slammed on its brakes.   I immediatly looked at my watch to make sure I had not lost time and got the heck out of there. I had always been a believer and that was just the icing on the cake.  I tried to rationalize it but nothing could explain the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));34.1327000000001;-81.3361000000003
