It’s was going southeast to northwest and then changed to west.  The object appeared as a very bright white light (almost like an electrical flash).  During its flight path it dropped a small object that was also bright in color.  I would say that it was a meteor or something to that affect but the dropped object did not stay in an angle path with the first.  It completely stopped when ejected and then drifted toward the ground.  The big light was moving at an incredible speed and was at best 4 miles from me.  The sighting ended when both objects vanished (they did not dim out they were there and then they weren’t).  I have seen a fireball when I was younger and have also seen several recordings of dissipating / breaking meteors but none of them behaved in the manner that this object did.
