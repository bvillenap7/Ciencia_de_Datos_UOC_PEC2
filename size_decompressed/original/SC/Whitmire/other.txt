The UFO I saw was on the FOX network!;1988-08-10 06:00:00;15 min +;The UFO I saw was on the FOX network! I had been outside watching the last of a meteor shower this particular night, when I had gone to bed. The sun was just coming up and I was looking out the window when I saw, what I thought was the moon at first. I got up and went back outside. I then realized that it was NOT the moon. It was a stationary object that reminded me of the shape of a king's crown. I stayed outside for about 10 minutes just looking at it. It didn't move at all. It was a silvery color that had a satin finish. I didn't see any lights although I do remember dark spaces like windows. After I went in to the house and went to sleep, I forgot about this. Years later, I was watching a ufo show on FOX when out of the blue I remembered seeing this. They had a pic on the show of the UFO that I had seen. On the show, a person had taken a photo of this. The photo was taken in Florida. I have searched and searched but I have not been able to locate an image of my UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.4925;-81.6028
