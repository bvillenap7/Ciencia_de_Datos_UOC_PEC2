I was camping alone in my little treehouse DEEP in the woods that I made for deer hunting (I swear I'm not crazy) when I heard a VERY weird sound of a low and slow flying object. I was awakened about 3:00 or 3:30 a.m. by a dog barking way off in the distance and a VERY strange sound that kept getting louder as it approched and flew directly overhead and then beyond and out of hearing range. Of course it's extremely difficult to describe sound but I'll try... It sounded like bubbles popping or like you stuck a straw into a bowl of water and blew accompanied by an electronic high pitch sound that would rise and fall about four times per second. No whirring of blades, no engine sound either, jet or piston, whatsoever. Scared me to death!  I've never heard anything like this in my life. I'm sorry, but I didn't see this thing because I was tucked into my sleeping bag and I had tarps draped and tied overhead to cut out the wind. I thought about trying to get a look at it, but by the time I got my wits enough to think about this it was very close and I guess I was just too scared or something and, man, the sound was just reverberating through the woods and it was just too weird. I'm really sorry now that I didn't try to see it but I just laid there wide-eyed and I bet you would have done the same (and I had a loaded Marlin 35).
