Evenly Spaced Lights.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-13 22:00:00;8 minutes;Clear sky.  Around 15-20 evenly spaced lights that sort of resembled stars. Traveling in unison with one line going  north and the other going south. Eventually they would disappear or seem to fade away. Almost looked as if you could actually some sort of “line” or “path” they were traveling on. Went on for around 8-10 minutes.;34.4925;-81.6028
