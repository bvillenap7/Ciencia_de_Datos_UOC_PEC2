Sudden Rush/Vacuum of air.;2015-01-19 03:22:00;7 seconds;While lying in bed I heard/felt a sudden rush of air that shook our house. I normally don't report things I see or encounter, but this was a first. I was having trouble sleeping so I was just lying in bed half asleep when a sudden rush/vacuum of air outside our home shook the whole house.  It lasted about 5-7 seconds.  I don't know how to explain it, but it was sudden and tremendous.  I've never experienced this before.  And it wasn't like wind pushing on the house, it felt like an upward vacuum with a crescendo.  We have occasional military jets fly over low so I understand the buildup of sound and vibration from those.  This was different. It was quick and right outside or above our house. It's not uncommon for me to see things people would deem ufo's and that's just normal. But this was different so I thought I'd report it.  Wish I had more info.  Thank you.;34.6006;-80.7142
