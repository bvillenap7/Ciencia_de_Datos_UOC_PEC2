3 bright lights - triangular formation.;2012-12-10 20:00:00;1 minute;3 bright lights - triangular formation 3 bright lights appeared in a triangular formation.  They stayed this way - really bright- then they were gone as fast as i could say what the heck is that to my husband- he seen them and then they were gone- we could not find them again-  we will be going out to check to see if there is any more activity- i am glad to have found this site- as we have seen around 5 sightings over the last few years.  We also heard around 5-8 gunshots after the lights disappeared- but none before that.;34.0555;-78.9183999999999
2 more pairs of light sightings over Myrtle Beach.;2013-01-15 09:35:00;30 seconds;2 more pairs of light sightings over Myrtle Beach The same thing just happened about 7:30 tonight.  We just seen the same lights in the same spot.  Then about 9:46 it happened again with 3 lights this time.  Gone before I could get my camera on. Earlier I had used my compass and i used it again and earlier it was 180 degrees off. This time it read 121 degrees SE from Loris SC.  It could be in the ocean???   I have no idea- my husband and I have both seen many flares, planes, helicopters.   My husband was ADA in the Army.  We have never seen this before.  I will be out tonight.;34.0555;-78.9183999999999

Orange lights in one direction although not in straight line and go out like flame;2020-05-10 23:50:00;5 minutes;Orange lights in one direction although not in straight line and go out like flame I was on highway 701, right outside of Loris, SC and saw an orange light coming from my right. I thought it was maybe a plane or helicopter although I have never seen a plane or flying craft with an orange light before. I then noticed 3 more coming along behind it although not in an exact straight line. They were going fast. I decided to roll my window down and my radio off in order to listen for any related noises. I could not hear anything. I did not take video of the incident and did not think to until I was parked in my garage. I went to put down my garage door and saw another orange light heading in the same general direction, which I believe to be west although I could be wrong. I took a short video, around 25 seconds, of the lone light. All of them just disappeared without a trace. I looked at them until I could see no more. They almost seemed to go out like a flame would. The lights were still going straight when they disappeared and not towards the ! ground. I have never seen anything like this before nor have I reported any related incidents.;34.0555;-78.9183999999999
