Myself and a friend were driving down Red Bluff Road towards Loris.I know it was 10:00pm.I had just looked at the car clock,wanting to make sure it wasn't to late,my husband worries when I am out late.About 100 yards ahead was a green glowing Tube shaped object. To best describe it, it was like a gaint glow stick.It rose above the tree line hovered maybe 5 seconds and then just shot straight up. Scared me so bad I was shaking. When I got home I wasn't sure I wanted to get out of the car.  After several deep breathes, I got out and went straight inside.I was to scared to even look up at the sky.
