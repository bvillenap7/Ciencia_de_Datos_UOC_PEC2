Strange Slow moving string of lights over Loris, SC, Not an airplane;2012-09-12 19:30:00;30 minutes;Strange Slow moving string of lights over Loris, SC, Not an airplane I was sitting in my vehicle in a parking lot waiting for my children to come out of a youth group meeting. I had my sunroof cover open and it was dusk. I noticed some lights going overhead from my peripheral vision and looked up to see.   I passed it off as an airplane going over about to land and did not think much about it. I noticed it again when we were leaving and thought the airplane would have already landed.  This was still moving Long at a very slow pace and the same altitude.  It was a long string of lights moving very slowly and low in the sky, almost hovering but moving.  As I was driving I lost sight and tried to find it again to get video or pictures, but never found it again.  There were probably 15-20 lights, but not in a straight line.  Possibly could have been a chevron shape and the angle I was looking made it look closer together, so would make the odd shape I saw.  The lights were not white, they were like a golden orangey color and they did not! blink like an airplane. They were constant.;34.0555;-78.9183999999999
5 lights seen above tree line NW of Loris, SC.;2013-01-15 18:30:00;1 minute;5 lights seen above tree line NW of Loris, SC. I have seen a lot of activity in this same area. This activity was NW 310 degrees from Loris. There was one light white in color.   We thought it was an airplane and then another light appeared to the right of the first one.  We thought it was two airplanes and then 2 more lights appeared to the left.  Then the second light mentioned turned into 2 lights for a total of 5 individual lights.  Before I could get my camera on they were gone.  The first two appeared to spin and then they were all gone.;34.0555;-78.9183999999999
