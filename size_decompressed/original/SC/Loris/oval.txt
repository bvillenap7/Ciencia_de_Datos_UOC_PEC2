We were very alarmed.    When we saw the lights there were only 2 at first, then another appeared then the 4th appeared.  They were spread out in a diamond shape. When they disappeared they did so in order like 4, 3, and then the last 2 went out at the same time.  I believe the whole thing lasted about 15- 30 seconds.  When the lights went out it was as if a door was pulled accross them from left to right and each one went out in this sequence.   I do not believe this could have been flares because they appeared and went out in a very orderly way as if it was in a pattern that someone was controlling.;34.0555;-78.9183999999999
