At about 6:45 in the evening (it was still light out), I saw two rice-shaped white objects in the sky.  They were moving parallel to one other, somewhat slowly, but steadily.  A minute or so after they disappeared from sight, I saw another similar object moving in approximately the same direction.  Shortly after that one disappeared, I saw another one moving in the opposite direction (the only one moving in that direction).  I saw a total of either six or seven objects, over about a fifteen minute period.  They did not move in an unusual way, they just looked different from anything I have seen.  At one point during my sighting, (I would guess the third or fourth object that I saw) the object appeared very bright, or reflective.  That brightness/reflectiveness lasted a few seconds.   And also, during this (approximate) fifteen minute time interval, I saw a military aircraft (dark gray in color) in the same general area of the sky in which these other objects were appearing.  A military maneuver of some kind??????  I am interested to know what these things were. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke to this witness as length, and we found her to be exceptionally credible.  We do not know what it was she witnessed.  We know that the beach at Hilton Head, SC, has a high frequency of osprey birds (fish eagles,) but we seriously doubt whether the witness would have mistaken these birds for something other than what they are.
