strange lights off south carolina coast;2006-07-16 21:00:00;30 minutes;strange lights off south carolina coast We were on the balcony of condo vacation rental and my dad (68 years) said I wonder what those lights are. We all watched for a good half hour as they would appear and disappear, as well as light in a succession of bright orange lights a couple of times. There were four adults witnessing with no explanation. Checked out local news for other reports but did not find any.;32.2125;-80.7539
