My family was staying on Hilton Head Island for a week on vacation.  One night, my wife and I decided to take a stroll on the beach.  As we were heading back to the beach access point, I noticed an orange glow in the sky.  I stopped to take a good look at it.  I can best describe it as a very dimly lit bonfire in the sky.  I did not hear sound (other than the crashing waves) and it did not move. Before I could mention it to my wife, it faded away.  About a minute later, there it was again, only this time, a little farther away from the first location.  This time my wife also witnessed it.  Two minutes later, faded away.  Again, within a minute it had reappeared in a third location.  As before, it slowly faded away after about 2 minutes. We stood and watched for it again, but it never reappeared. Sadly, I had no camera or cell phone with me. We could easily rule out fireworks, flares, Chinese lanterns or aircraft.  It was well above the water line to be a ship's lights. The best we could explain it was a dim fire just floating in the sky.  No noise, no movement other than appearing and disappearing in 3 different locations.;32.2125;-80.7539
