We went oustisde to look and saw several single flashing lights moving about in an ununiformed formation.   My wife looked west and pointed out a large slow moving triangle with flashing lights.  We watched it for 15 minutes go 10 miles north then turn and return towards us and passed us by heading towards the ocean(5 miles away).  It was probably hundreds of feet long with three lights that were flashing like laterns.   We also watched several single lights for 20 minutes.   We tried to take photos using 3 different devices with no results.  Very very clear night. one of the clearest i have seen in months.;33.9064;-78.7934
