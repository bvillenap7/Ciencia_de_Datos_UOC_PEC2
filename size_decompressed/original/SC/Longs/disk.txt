Orange lights on large disk, followed by smaller lights.;2015-03-06 17:00:00;5 minutes;Orange lights on large disk, followed by smaller lights. at first it was orange lights in the sky, coming closer to where we were standing, it seemed as though it was a number of small craft, but now after looking at the video, it was one large craft, and I mean large, perhaps miles larger and two smaller ones following it,  I did take video tape of it, and the craft is visible on it, as well as the lights.   My sister took a video with her Iphone as well,  my mother was also present.  I  continued taping with a second video the end of the event, we thought it was over until we watched the whole video.  Not visible to us at the time but visible on the video is a light that came down and kind of followed us.   As I said, we did not notice this at the time and not sure what the light was.  It seemed we were out there forever watching this, but the video says it was for only 2-3 minutes, not sure what that was about.   I also now have some white scarring on my arms where it looks like skin is missing, but it isn't missing, just the color has changed.  WE are very confused about what happened.  Can you help us?  I have videos, the file is too large too email on AOL, how can I get them to you?;33.9064;-78.7934
