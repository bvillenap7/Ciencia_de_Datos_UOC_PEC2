Very large triangle craft that was only lit on leading edges, silent and not actually visiable against night sky;2003-02-13 00:15:00;15 seconds;Very large triangle craft that was only lit on leading edges, silent and not actually visiable against night sky Saw a very large very quiet triangle shaped blank in the sky. It had 4 or 5 lights on each leading edge that were exactly as bright as stars and one very bright flasher following behind. It was silent and barely discernable like picking satellites out except that it was a perfect @120 degree V shape moving fluidly NW from directly overhead. The leading edge lights were star colored (same intensity but moving in unison), not red, green or blue and they were not navigation or formation lights. The light that was seeminly following the triangle was much brighter and seemed like a distraction that drew your eyes away from the perfect geometric constallation of smaller lights ahead of it. My wife saw it as well and was positive that it was one large solid object that had to be hundreds of yards across and emmitted no noise. It also appeared to pass through stars and not block them out. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS) I'm sorry about that, I was in a hurry before work. It was 12:15am Feb 13, 2003.
