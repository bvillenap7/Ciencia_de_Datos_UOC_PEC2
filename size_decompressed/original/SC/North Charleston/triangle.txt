Triangle object seen in sky above North Charleston.;2014-08-01 16:00:00;10 minutes;triangle object seen in sky above North Charleston. Was driving on Rivers Ave towards Cosgrove around 4pm, when I saw a triangle type figure hovering in the sky.  The object appeared to move quite rapidly.   I took a picture of the object on my cell phone.  It was in the distance but can definitely tell something is in the sky.;32.8883346153845;-80.0313269230768
