Object stood still in Charleston sky;2006-08-02 19:45:00;45 minutes;Object stood still in Charleston sky The dark grey-black object high in the NW sky stood still it was bell or dome-shaped.  A friend and I were lounging in my pool, just chit-chating and I was looking up and began to focus on what I thought was a bird.  Then I realized the bird wasn't moving I stood up and really began looking at this thing which looked like a dot in the sky.  My friend couldn't see it at first, but when she focused in at exactly where I told her to look, she said, yes, yes, ooohhhh, that's weird, what is it?  It wasn't until I got the binoculars that we could see that it was sort of dome or bell-shaped.  It was really far away and we couldn't make out an details.  We watched it for about a half an hour, then the night sky faded it out. Wonder if anyone else in the area saw it.;32.8883346153845;-80.0313269230768
