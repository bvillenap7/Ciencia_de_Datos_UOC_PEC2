A circular craft emerges twice from clouds on stormy night.;2014-07-21 21:00:00;5 seconds;A circular craft emerges twice from clouds on stormy night. Coming home from a birthday party that evening, I was sitting in the passenger seat looking at the clouds.  It was a stormy night and the rain had just died down.  The street was busy and the street lights were on.  It occurred on the end of Ashley phosphate.   As I was looking up towards the clouds I see this circular mass with lights around the edges of the craft emerge from the clouds.  It was still slightly covered with clouds leaving it looking foggy.   After it came down it went northwest and headed back up. about a second later the craft came down about 200ft away from the original position.   The craft was dark and the lights were a white yellow color that were shadowed by the clouds.  It was very large and was surprisingly close.  The clouds were hanging low already and the ship had to be maybe two feet higher than the clouds itself.;32.8883346153845;-80.0313269230768

Husband and I saw a bright round light (the size of a penny on the windshield) appear twice and fade, never moving.;2016-04-09 15:15:00;8 seconds;Husband and I saw a bright round light (the size of a penny on the windshield) appear twice and fade, never moving. My husband saw it first, a bright light the size of a penny (in perspective), then fade. He pointed in the direction he saw it.  This time I saw it as it reappeared, not quite as large the second time, but just as bright, then it quickly faded away again.  It never moved as it flashed.  We continued to watch the sky but it never reappeared.  The sky was relatively clear with a few short chemical trails, but nothing close to the object other than a lower flying aircraft appeared to be flying unusually fast toward the spot.  The sun was visible some distance away from it in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.8883346153845;-80.0313269230768
