Saw a UFO at night in the woods near power lines.;1998-08-08 00:00:00;8 minutes;Saw a UFO at night in the woods near power lines. Was sitting in a car with 4 friends in the woods. There were power lines going through the woods for miles in one direction. We were just talking and facing in one direction of the lines. One friend mentioned a bright star and the rest of us looked at it and paid no attention.  After about 5 min, it got bright enough to look like a plane was coming straight along with the power lines and had a headlight.  When it got close enough for us to get a good look at it, it was right over the tree line. It had 3 colors swinging under it.  Blue, white and red.  We had one car window rolled down and I noticed there was no sound coming from the so called plane. I turned the radio off, rolled down my window and so did my friends. We all sat there silently watching this thing pass by. It made a silent whining sound and passed by very slowly and dissapeared beyond the trees. After we couldn't see it anymore, my friends panicked. We never could explain what it was and noone could explain to us what it was. It was about 50 feet from us when it passed by at about 5 MPH. I am now 35 and this happened when I was around 18 years old. Every now and then, we talk about it and we can't figure out what it was. Maybe some kind of high tech government plane?

Object with very large bright light chased by jet with rapid flashing red and green wing lights.;2003-01-17 00:00:00;10-15 min.;Object with very large bright light chased by jet with rapid flashing red and green wing lights. Late one night last month (January) my teenage son called me to go outside. He was standing in our front yard staring at the night sky. I looked up to see an object being chased by an aircraft, a jet. The object being chased had what seemed to be a circular shape of very bright light or lights. The light appeared to be one mass from our distance and point of view. The shape of the whole craft could not be made out. We recognized the jet by the wings lights, one red, one green, and a center light. The lights on the jet were flashing in rapid procession. I commented that it looked like the air police. The jet was gaining in distance between it and the object, and just when it got close the object accelerated and began and incredible acsent as it was circling back toward the Charleston Air Force Base. We live only a few blocks from the AFB main gate. I went into my house to find a pair of binoculars. My son ran in to get the phone to call a friend that lives in the neighborhood. My son's friend saw the 'chase'. I recall the chill in the air and wishing I had something on my feet. The sky was not very cloudy, or atleast there was no cloud coverage to obstruct our view. The crafts were flying SE to NW. Looped around the Air Base and then continued WNW. My son has studied aircraft since the age of 3. His goal is to become a pilot, but what he saw was difficult to explain with all his knowledge of aircraft, old, new, and experimental. Because of my son's interest we have for years looked to the sky. He is somewhat expert in recognizing types of aircraft from sight and/or sound. He, nor I, have any knowledge of what American craft uses such lighting. The object was so large and bright that it was highly noticeable. We thought that something would have been broadcasted on the news. There was illness in the family which did not permit me to do an online search until now. I was very happy to see that atleast one other person in the area could confirm our sighting. One explaination was that the USAF was testing out a new aircraft, but that gave rise to why it was pursued by a jet with rapid flashing lights. I would have thought such a test would have been more discreet. I am suggesting to my son and his friend that they add their own discription and comments to this site.

It was coming down slow within tree height and flew away when we got close to it.;2014-09-01 04:00:00;4 minutes;It was coming down slow within tree height and flew away when we got close to it. Flew down slow with flashing yellow lighting and when we drove closer to area, it flew away behind trees from our sight like it knew we seen it.

Strange light in sky sitting still not moving Strange aura or haze around it;2015-01-02 02:15:00;3 minutes;Strange light in sky sitting still not moving Strange aura or haze around it Was driving home from work around 2AM on I-26 heading east away from Charleston (In between Aviation & Ashley Phosphate) when I noticed a light in the sky about a mile from me. This happens to be within a mile of the local airport, Charleston int or Charleston AFB.  Anyhow the light caught my attention because it was not moving just sitting there.   As I went under the overpass for Ashley Phosphate and came out the other side I could see the object very clear.  The object was just above the tree tops. (200 ft.)  The strange thing was that it had like some kind of plasma around it.  So I was unable to figure the shape of it.  Decided to pull off the road and look at this strange object. It had some type white lights on it.  Was able to pull over just after the on ramp from Ashley Phosphate, this put me about 300 yards away.  It was directly across from me. Could see the object without any problems.  The sky was clear no clouds and cold not hear any sound.  After stopping it seem to notice me watching it.  Within 3-4 seconds it started to move slowly forward and down below the tree line.  Watched until it was out of sight. Was in the AF for 21 years and never saw anything like this before.  This kind of Technology should be shared with us.  I know what I saw.  This is not the only siting that I have had.   What is going on out there????;32.8883346153845;-80.0313269230768
Shiny object tumbling across the sky.;2017-05-18 15:25:00;4-5 minutes;Shiny object tumbling across the sky. I was walking my dog and a shimmer caught my eye above me.  When I looked up directly in front of me at @ 45 degrees, I first thought it was a birthday balloon.  I quickly realized it was much much larger.   I had on a very good pair of sunglasses and had a clear unobstructed view.  The object appeared to be tumbling and moving from south to north.  It reflected the sun intensely and intermittently.   I observed the object for about 4 minutes until it vanished.   I would estimate its size to that of a car.  Altitude approximately 8-9000 ft.  The object made no audible sound.;32.8883346153845;-80.0313269230768
Bright light, not changing, moving fast and low, completely silent.;2018-10-06 01:00:00;2 minutes;Bright light, not changing, moving fast and low, completely silent. 10/6/18 @ 1:30am EST  Noticed a bright light with two smaller red blinking lights close to the Charleston International Airport.  By all indications, including proximity to the airport, I would guess this to be a helicopter based on the altitude and speed, however, there was no engine/rotor noice what so ever.   At this time of night, sounds of traffic and sirens can be heard from miles away on Rivers Avenue or I26, however, this 'craft' was moving at a fairly fast clip, very low altitude (approx only several hundred feet max) and based on the size of the light/glow, suggesting close proximity, the engine or rotor sounds should have been heard.  This is the second sighting of this in approximately the same location, however, the blinking red lights (similar to any ordinary aircraft) were not present on the 1st sighting which occurred in early September 2018.   Another oddity about this particular sighting is that it appeared to pick up speed and get lower, however, the size of the light did not app! ear to change which suggested that the range stayed roughly the same, as if moving in a circular pattern, which would then not suggest the airport as a destination.;32.8883346153845;-80.0313269230768
