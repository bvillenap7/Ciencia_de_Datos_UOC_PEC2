White light in North Charleston, SC;2010-07-04 21:30:00;a few minutes;White light in North Charleston, SC On July 4 2010 I was in the hospital in Trident Medical Center in North Charleston, SC,  watching fireworks out of a window, looking towards Charleston Southern University, which is across the street. It was sometime between 9PM and 10PM. I noticed a bright white light, in the direction NWN, about two fists above the horizon, not much higher than the fireworks going off all over the horizon.  I guess it was two or a few times brighter than Venus, and seemed to be stationary, maybe moving a little bit.  My guess was that it was a helicopter less than a mile from me, coming in to the hospital - except that it never came.  I watched it for a few minutes, maybe 5-10, but it didn't change appreciably in any way.  Then it just kind of disappeared.  I assumed it was a plane or helicopter that turned a different direction, but I never saw one. It seemed a little strange.  I assumed (and still think it's likely) that it was a plane or helicopter, but considering the numerous reports that night, I have decided to make this report.;32.8883346153845;-80.0313269230768
