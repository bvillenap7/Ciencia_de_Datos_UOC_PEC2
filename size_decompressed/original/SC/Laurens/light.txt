Bright light and several others and it went completely out;2001-02-05 22:00:00;30 minutes +-;Bright light and several others and it went completely out My husband came home about 9:30pm, we went outside to have a cigarette and my husband told me to look towards the east which I did, there was a bright light coming towards us it was moving very slowly and I assumed it was a plane with it's landing light on, which is alot in this area because of a nearby airport. We spotted a plane to the south of it and noticed that it was going to be above this light, as soon as the plane was over it, it disappeared completely. We then noticed it but it was now in the south sky, how it got from being east at one moment and then to completely disappear and then show up without us seeing it move. We then watched it head towards the west a little more then it headed sort of northwest, it had several lights on it, a strobe, and a green light and a red, but it made no sound, and there were several plaanes in the area that did not match this thing at all. Also. about two weeks ago we saw a similar light more towards the southwest and it basically did the same thing except it never disappeared like it did last night.;34.4973;-82.0079000000001
