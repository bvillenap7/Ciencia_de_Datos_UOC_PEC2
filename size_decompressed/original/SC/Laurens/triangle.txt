pulsating orange lights in a triangle formation;2011-11-07 19:00:00;2 minutes;pulsating orange lights in a triangle formation Around 7 pm est I saw three burnt orange lights in a triangle formation moving south above the tree line parallel to my home.   I live beside a 50+ acre field with great visibility and a perfect view of the night sky.   At first I thought I was seeing maybe car or truck brake lights on my property so I walked to the edge of the field to check it out and quickly realized it was something flying.  The lights seemed to be pulsating on and off about every two seconds.   I cant say how far away it was, but I heard no plane or helicopter sounds.  Sounds crazy but thats what I saw.;34.4973;-82.0079000000001
