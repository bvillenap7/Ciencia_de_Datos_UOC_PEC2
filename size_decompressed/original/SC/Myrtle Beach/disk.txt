Spotted Medium Speed moving object heading NNW, below the clouds.;1998-12-21 02:10:00;30 seconds;Spotted Medium Speed moving object heading NNW, below the clouds. Heading North on Hwy 17 bypass at 2:10 A.M. on 12/21/98. While in a very dark section of roadway, the hood of my pickup truck started to glow gold (brown truck), suddenly above, suddenly above my truck I saw a glowing green object heading NNW, at a medium speed, slower than a meteorite but faster than a jet. It continued in this direction for about 10 seconds, when it suddenly turned left, not a curved left, a sharp angle left, and disappeared over the horizon. It was cloudy, so when I arrived at my destination ten minutes later, I turned on the weather channel to note the cloud level at 10,000 feet. It was definitly below the clouds.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

We were not all the way out to the ocean, and in the marsh heading out, and had stopped to see if we could get a bite, and the sun hit the Huge Silver Saucer, and for a few min. it just sit there, and then all of a sudden, it flew off to the South with NO Sound!   We think it was around 300-500 feet in the sky, and it was tilted towards us, and that was when we seen the sun bouncing off the Large Silver Saucer!  We did not see any lights, I guess because it was daylight.  We also saw a cigar shaped UFO just hanging in the sky, as we came down Business 17 South in Myrtle Beach,S.C.   My wife saw a Large Bright light years ago, that chased her while on a date, on Fork Shoals Rd, in Greenville/Piedmont, S.C. in the fall of 1972.   She also saw another light that was following her, and she thought it was the police pulling her over, while drivin! g a large truck to pick up some gas lanterns in Georgetown,S.C.,  But her and the girl getting the Lanterns had just got something to eat in Florence,S.C., and she had just pulled out of a steak house around 8:00 PM, and when she started to pull over, the light just vanished, and that makes twice she has had a light to chase her!  I also saw some lights out over the Ocean while I was surf fishing, and there was about 4 of us out there on the beach, an the lights would split apart, and one would be one color, and  The large one that came on first was pale white, and closed like a lens closing, and it was about 3 ft, and two more came on. It looked like a swirl, and split off, and the people that was shooting fireworks, and these lights reacted to the fireworks.  I saw jets that looked like they came from Shaw AFB, that looked like F15-16, and they had missiles under them, and flew around, and returned to Shaw right after they were in the sky.   One light was in the East, and one i! n the south east. We would like to talk with you about these UFO'S IF YOU WILL PLEASE CALL US SO WE CAN TELL YOU MORE!;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Two circular object with morphing interchangeable colors, definetly discs,emanating blue green light.;2003-12-27 14:30:00;10  minutes;Two circular object with morphing interchangeable colors, definetly discs,emanating blue green light. On the afternoon of Dec 27th,  2003, while sitting and talking to a man on the bench near the ocean In Myrtle Beach South Carolina about 500 yds from the ocean, there appeared in the sky above and to the west a disc approximately the size of a slightly oversized silver dollar. Above it and to the upper left hand quadrant was a smaller one about the size of a nickle. I observed the object kind of floating with the wind which was moving from SW by W (I'm A sailor and am very cognizant of wind direction and speed.) I commented that it looked like someone's balloon had gotten either loose or out of control. What made me think it was a balloon was the fact that it looked like a target, circular in shape with an orange center and a black perifory. This color combination changed from black out side to orange outside and as that happened the black moved to the center. I assumed I was looking at some sort of prismatic plastic balloon that changes colors as it changes angles to the light source. Then something happened that made me realize this was not a ballon at all, because it stopped and hovered for a bit then it began moving into what would have been the winds opposite direction. The smaller one did the same thing also. The two of them moved in a floating manner and there were no sudden or quick movements. At this time both the man I was talking to began to realize we were looking at something entirely new to both of us. However about two minutes into this sighting the large circle went up on it's side turning the target like image on end. It was at this point we realized we were looking at a disc.  There was no dome it seemed to be a flat disc with only a small thickness in proportion to it's size.  After about a minute more in this position it again went circular and turned once more to the side   Now we saw a glittering flash indicating that we were looking at something metallic. It flashed momentarily then went on it's side at this point the colored side would have been facing away from earth with the shiny side down. There was an instant when a blue green light best described as aquamarine in color emanated from the circular disk in a cone like manner,and completely around the disc, so much as we could discern form the angle we were looking at it. The light seemed to be widening as it shone down towads earth. This lasted for about two seconds. Meanwhile the two objects still close enough to be observed without having to look from one to the other, the small one went up on edge and we lost sight of it never agan to see it. After the larger one exhibithed the light phenomenon, we saw it return to it's original orange and black colors and still the colors seemed to bleed into one another and exchange places black inside orange outside and vice versa, kind of reminded us of a lava lamp. By this time we noticed another course change the large one still it's approximate original size began to change directions and again going with the wind began to move out over the ocean. We watched it turn from circle to flat and back to circle. all the time this object was not hurrying. We both agreed that we were watching something totally new to us, then without so much as a change in course the orange and black circular disc facing us back on the beach and still at this time the size of a quarter just absolutely and completely disappeard before our eyes. We tried to guess the height of the objects we were looking at,but since we had no way of knowing what size it was we couldn't accurately describe the height . There was no relative size to compare it with . However based on the size of one to the other and comparing the two we thought perhaps if one of the object s the larger one was at 3ooo feet the smaller one would have been perhaps 5ooo We could only guess. The sky that day was crystal clear not a cloud, or a mist or anykind of sight inhibiting thing that would have caused us an illusion of any sort.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Lights cut on then off like some one cut on a light switch.  Waited about 5 seconds then cut off.  This happened 4 times in the same spot over the course of about 20 minutes.  The objects didn't move they were stationary. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from the Myrtle Beach area for this date.  PD));33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

We were looking around in the sky and noticed a strange circular or balloon shaped metallic object in the opposite direction.  This was a craft than none of us have ever seen before.  We watched the craft for 30 seconds or so then we decided to get some videos of it.  By the time I had reached for my phone I watched this craft take off at a profound speed that I have never seen before then it was gone.  This was something totally different than I have ever seen before.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
