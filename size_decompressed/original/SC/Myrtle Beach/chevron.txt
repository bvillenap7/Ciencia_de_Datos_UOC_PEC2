My roommate and I had just taken the dogs outside for the last time of the evening. As a habit of mine, while walking my dog, I always look up to the nighttime sky in search of shooting stars.  Suddenly this orangish-reddish glow appeared in the sky moving in a zig - zag pattern from North to Northeast. Keeping my eye on it, I thought it's going to fast to be an airplane and too slow to be a shooting star. Eventually right before it hit a patch of clouds in the sky, the thing seemed to disappear.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Clear, starry night.  Looked up at sky at airplane and then my vision was blocked by a huge, black, chevron shaped object with 3 red lights at the middle and tip of the object.   It totally blocked out the sky as it went overhead, but I could still see the plane in the distance and the stars, all but where this object (huge) was overhead, about 1,500 feet off ground.  Seemed very low to me.   Did anyone else report an object in sky.  No sounds at all of an engine.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
