Bright orange balls of light in random formations and quickly moving, chased by military jets;2011-06-08 21:45:00;45 minutes;Bright orange balls of light in random formations and quickly moving, chased by military jets Bright orange balls of light were making random appearances north of Myrtle Beach.  At times there would be one bright orange ball of light that would appear, disappear and the reappear miles away in just a fraction of a second. At other times more than one object would appear and then move around at velocities and speeds unknown by known aircraft.  No sonic booms, no sounds. At approximately 22:00 5 bright orange balls of light appeared in a pentagon formation all at once and then 2 other lights appeared.  The 5 lights remain steady while the other 2 move around. At approximately 22:15 we see 3 jets approach the area at high speed.  When the jets arrive there is nothing there so they quickly turn around and head back in the direction of Shaw AFB. We have been seeing these balls of light, on and off, for several months and it always happens around the same time of night.  The balls of light appear to be over the North Myrtle Beach area.  Sometimes over the ocean and sometimes over land. The appearance last night, based on this report, happened over land.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Then it dissappeared! I ran into the hotel lobby to tell my neice!  Then she followed me outside, so i could show her the place in the sky I had seen it!  Then we witnessed a lot of blinking lights that we thought were airplane, only they stayed in place.  As we continued to watch the bright lights appeared again but multiple, then vanished!  We continued to look and within minutes they appeared again but this time bright in a triangler formation! We saw a guy pass and asked him to look to see if we were crazy but he was amazed also!  They vanished again then appeared again.  Then we walked closer to the ocean! All of a sudden it looked like a sphere of lights hover the ocean and the sky!  Really creepy this couple was passing and wanted to know what all the fuss was about!  Of course it dissappeared when they looked but after a few mins they also witnessed a fo! rmation of lights going up like steps! Then they vanished and we saw the blinking plane like lights again moving east until we saw nothing! It was creepy yet exciting!;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Bright orange lights in a formation, some seperation movement, then vanish in SC.;2012-11-04 19:00:00;2 minutes;Bright orange lights in a formation, some seperation movement, then vanish in SC. I was standing outside my front door having a cigarette and just happened to look towards the lower sky in front of me.  I see 4 or 5 orange glowing lights almost in a circle/oval type shape, they didn't move at first, then it appeared at least two of them started moving into the center of the formation after a min or so and then all of the lights vanished at the same time.  The lights were brighter than stars and all of them glowed orange in color.  After they vanished i heard faint rumbling sounds like thunder for about 30 seconds in the sky.  This was not very high in the sky either....from my view point the lights were maybe 300-500 feet in the air.  I noticed flashing lights from aircraft shorty afterwards flying around and through the area.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Witnessed from two different distances within the same 10 mile radius.  3 lit up an orange-golden amber in an ascending line segment of about 45 degrees.  Another three followed the same light up pattern totaling 6 visible at once.  Each of them dimmed in the same pattern as they fired.  As the last two were dimming a 7th light identical to the other 6 followed the same pattern of dimming.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Balls of red light over ocean doing a leap frog motion.;2013-06-11 22:30:00;15 seconds;Balls of red light over ocean doing a leap frog motion The was a red ball of light in the sky over the ocean. It was very high, and far away.  A second red light appeared to the right of it.  The first faded out and then a third appeared to the right of the second.  A forth red light then appeared as the second faded.  Then, the third faded, soon followed by the fourth.  They were all evenly spaced from one another, seemingly on the same craft, which would have been enormous.  This was also during a lightning storm which was also over the distant ocean, but miles to the South.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

My wife and I were watching the fireworks from our balcony that was at Pier 14 that started at 10pm that night.  The fireworks lasted till around 1010 pm and approx 1015 straight over the ocean I noticed a orange light that lit up and disappeared a few times.   Then six lights appeared in a half circle and appeared to rotate and disappear one by one.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Three bright white lights seen in formation above the ocean in Myrtle Beach;2015-06-16 19:45:00;5-10 minutes;Three bright white lights seen in formation above the ocean in Myrtle Beach I was in Myrtle Beach with a group of my friends for a vacation and we all had decided to go sit down on the beach itself and just take in the waves and wind. The sun had just set, and there was a fair amount of light still illuminating the western sky, but the shoreline faces east in South Carolina so the sky over the ocean was about 80% of the total darkness it would reach, by my estimation.  My friends and I were sitting in the sand directly facing the ocean. I was looking above the water at the stars and the various aircraft traveling through the sky when I noticed something odd. There were three sustained white lights in a very close and tight triangular formation. When I first saw them they weren’t moving, and I shrugged it off as a natural occurrence but still kept my eye on them. Suddenly, all three objects began advancing westward (toward land) in perfect unison. This is when I alerted some of my friends to what I was seeing. The lights kept perfect formation and moved very slowly. The lights continued to move for a minute or two before stopping on a dime and maintaining the formation. The lights held there for another minute or so, and then they simply vanished. No movement or anything. The lights were there and then they weren’t. It was almost as if they were switched off somehow.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Orange lights in saucer like formation over Myrtle Beach, SC.;2017-11-16 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;Orange lights in saucer like formation over Myrtle Beach, SC. My fiancé and I were sitting outside on our balcony having a smoke when I saw a row of 4 orange lights in the distance over his shoulder.  I immediately told him to look, because it was very unnatural.  As soon as he turned around they all went out, then the one that was furthest to the right went back on.  Then the one next to it came back on.  Then those 2 went back off and the third one came on and went off.  Then the one that was furthest to the left cane on.  My fiancé, who always finds a way to explain things rationally was a little shook up.  He stood up and started scanning the sky and we were both asking each other what it was and both decided it couldn’t be explained.  After about 30 seconds to 1 minute one single light popped on a little ways from where the original lights were, to the right and up higher than before.  And it quickly went back off.  The four lights that I saw at first appeared to be a part on one single object, they were in a perfect line! and didn’t move at all. It seemed like a saucer type object, but the line of lights was slightly tilted.  They were not very far away, they appeared to be sitting about as high as a helicopter flies.  If it has been daytime I believe it would have been close enough to make out the details of the object.  The lights were a dull orange color, and much bigger and brighter than lights I’ve seen on planes.  The light that appeared on its own had me thinking all the light may have been separate objects, but were just in some kind of formation.  It’s hard to say.  The entire experience was very eerie and unexplainable.  Furthermore, this is the second UFO experience I have had in the Myrtle Beach area.  The first one was 8 years ago at about 3pm, a bright clear day.  I saw 3 huge bright orbs zipping around, almost like they were dancing in the sky.  They were turning on and off, appearing and reappearing in different spots in the sky.  I was driving when it happened,  I pulled over and watch! ed the orbs for about 10 minutes with 4 other people.  I was so! concern ed that I drove to the Myrtle Beach airport and reported what I saw.  That has always stuck with me, and ever since that day I look up every chance I get.  I don’t know what these objects are, but I know they weren’t anything the public has any knowledge of.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
