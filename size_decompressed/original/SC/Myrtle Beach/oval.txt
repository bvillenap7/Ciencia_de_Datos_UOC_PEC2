They faded within 3-5 seconds and were directly followed by white/blue/silver lights that appeared to rotate around the first light. This kept repeating for 2-2.5 hrs. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the correct date of the alleged sighting is.  The witness states above that it was on August 17, but then enters a date of August 16.  The lights sound like they might have been advertising lights.  PD));33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
I saw a bright oval object in the skies over Myrtle Beach SC.;2006-06-20 22:30:00;15 SECONDS;I saw a bright oval object in the skies over Myrtle Beach SC. I could not believe what I was seeing. I believe they knew we were looking by the way they moved in the sky. It would disapear then reappear in a different spot. Then it pulsed and disapeared. It reappeared one more time in a due westerly direction. The object was a bright yellow, pulsating to a blinding yellow before disapearing for good. This experience lasted for approxamately 10 to 15 seconds. I was not alone.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Bright light with bright blue tail;2007-07-27 21:00:00;2-3 sec;Bright light with bright blue tail My brother and I were sitting on a small deck at a condo complex at the beach. The beach was to our left approximately 100 - 200 yards away.  With the ocean to our left. The view directly in front of us was a parking lot, approx. 50 yards across, and another building of the condo complex. As my brother and I sat there talking I was kind of just gazing at the sky.  It was a pretty hot somewhat humid night.  Out of nowhere above the building facing us, a very bright white oval shape with a very bright kind of halogen blue tail flew about half way across the building east to west at a slight down hill angle.  I was already looking at the sky so I saw it just appear and immediately said to my brother something like look at that shit and he looked up and saw it fly across the building.  It flew across with no sound for approximately 2 seconds then just disappeared. It appeared very close.  Very vivid color, very bright. The path of travel was east to west, appearing to me approximately 100 yards from the beach and flying about 2 seconds I would say about 50 yards.  It seemed to be right over top of the building which was about 50 yards away and maybe 40-60 feet above the building. Very close. There was no arch to its path it was almost horizontal. Just at a slight downward path. I donâ€™t know what I saw but I cannot imagine what it could have been. Fireworks were being let off on the beach but this was silent, had no smoke or trail left behind of smoke or ash of any sort and flew with no arch.  I rule firework our pretty easily. It appeared to be way to close to be a meteor.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Two red ovals moving in irregular movements in a south-east approach.;2007-08-22 21:00:00;15 minutes;Two red ovals moving in irregular movements in a south-east approach. My friend and I were staying in a Hotel in Myrtle Beach South Carolina on vacation. We were in a beach front room, so our balcony was overlooking the ocean. We were out on our balcony (on the 18th floor) because we were smoking a cigarette and we were trying to see lightning as it hit the ocean. It was a stormy night but we could see some stars still. So my friend looked off to the left of our balcony, so he was looking north, and he spotted these 2 red-orange ovals in the sky. Then he pointed them out to me. They were fairly small just a little bigger than the stars, we couldn't hear any noise from them. They were traveling from North to South (from the left to the right of our balcony). It was hazy out, so they were not bright at all. Kind of a dim red orange glow. At first I thought they were just airplanes, but they moved in an irregular way. They moved very slowly, and the did not stay the same distance from each other. They did somewhat of a dance around each other, getting closer and further from each other. We watched them do this slow dance all the way across our view of the sky, but as they moved south they also moved out over the ocean further (east). Eventually, about 10 or 15 minutes after we first spotted them, they faded too far into the horizon to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

((HOAX??))  The object was orangish in color with red lights hovering still above the ocean for about an hour and just faded away.;2011-05-29 01:00:00;1 HOUR;The object was orangish in color with red lights hovering still above the ocean for about an hour and just faded away. Saw an oval object yelloish/organge with 3 red blinking lights on the bottom of it.  One light on each end of the object and one in the middle hovering over the Atlantic Ocean.   Saw what looked like people dressed in all black climbing down what looked like a latter and dropping into the ocean.   When I tried to take a picture with my phone the phone would shut off.  I did get two pictures, but all you can see is a bright light.  It didn't look like it was very high up in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether this is a serious report.

Orange oval-shaped object, with orange droplets, seen over Myrtle Beach.;2014-07-24 20:00:00;5 minutes;Orange oval-shaped object, with orange droplets, seen over Myrtle Beach. Around 20:00 hrs., an orange oval appeared in the sky.  It almost appeared to be a star, but was much to bright.   After not moving for a few minutes it looked as if droplets were dripping from the craft.  These droplets were the same color as the craft.   It remained stationary for about 5 minutes before slowly fading away. I'm usually very skeptical of UFO sightings, but this was something I couldn't explain.  My sister was also outside with me and saw the same thing.   I was lucky enough to get a video of it, sadly my phone doesn't have the best quality, but never less I feel lucky to have a video regardless of the quality. After searching on the internet I was easily able to find similar stories containing UFOs that are explained exactly as I just did, even down to the droplets I saw.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
A orange round light. It would get brighter then move and leave a trail behind it, get brighter again, move and leave a trail behind it;2018-03-07 22:30:00;15 seconds;A orange round light.  It would get brighter then move and leave a trail behind it, get brighter again, move and leave a trail behind it again.  It did this about 5 times.   I believe this is the same siding as the person who posted the last post below me;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
