Bright stationary orange light of short duration near Mars;2003-08-26 21:00:00;2 hours;Bright stationary orange light of short duration near Mars My wife and I were on Myrtle Beach at about 21:00 to observe Mars. The sky was very clear and many stars were visible over the ocean horizon. There was a slight haze over the water that obscured the horizon.  As we sat on the beach watching the sky, there appeared a bright stationary light with a orange huge high in the sky. It was as intense as Mars and for a moment looked as though there were 2 Mars. The light persisted for several seconds and winked out. We continued to watch and the light appeared again in a different location, it appeared first on the left of Mars and then on the right and slightly lower in the sky. Again the light appeared and blinked out after 2 seconds.  We were really excited as this was like nothing we had ever seen before, it changed position but not in a straight path.  After about 20 mins. 2 lights appeared together to the left of Mars both appeared and winked out after about 2 seconds. The last sighting was to the right of Mars and low on the horizon, the light was partially obscured by the layer of haze and shone more red in color.  We observed Mars for several more nights and looked for the lights, they did not reappear.  The night was quite and what aircraft traffic was in the sky was clearly visible. One thought I had was that the lights might be the afterburners on some military aircraft out over the ocean. I have never observed them at night and do not know how they would appear. I mention this because there is a military base near by and I did see 2 F-16â€™s earlier that day. They were very load and flew out over the ocean. The lights we saw were stationary and we heard no aircraft noise. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but we believe one possibility to explore would be landing lights on approaching commercial or military aircraft.  Just a guess on our part.  PD));33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
More orange lights over Myrtle Beach;2003-09-09 22:00:00;10 seconds;More orange lights over Myrtle Beach My wife and I were sitting on our front porch, about five blocks from the beach. I noticed several yellowish or orange lights in the sky to the east, which would place them over the ocean. I drew my wife's attention to the lights just before they blinked out. She did get to see them, saying that there were four lights configured so that they appeared to be the headlights of a car. A similar sighting was reported to NUFORC on August 31, also in Myrtle Beach. The NUFORC note suggested they could be landing lights. As a resident of Myrtle Beach, I can state that these lights were the wrong color and were stationary, whereas aircraft landing lights are a brilliant white and slowly move toward the airport. Our sighting was several days after that other one, and yet the similarity is striking. As to our backgrounds: my wife works in law enforcement and I am a teacher.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Lights off the coast;2005-02-03 15:00:00;15 Seconds;In response to the Myrtle Beach Reports: I was vacationing in Myrtle Beach. I saw red lights off the coast. A few seconds later, they appeared again, at least a mile from where they first appeared.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Fading lights over Myrtle Beach, SC.;2006-07-21 22:00:00;A few seconds.;Fading lights over Myrtle Beach, SC. I was driving home on highway 31, when I saw a circular light fade in on the night sky. At first I thought it to be some sort of star, but as it started to fade away (there was no horizontal or vertical movement just fading) another object started to fade in to its right. Then that faded and at the same time, another object was fading in downward to its right. Then that faded, as it faded, two lights faded in next to it. Once those lights faded there was nothing else. A few days ago I had seen footage a man took of the pheonix lights three hours before they showed up to most people, and these UFOs or this UFO took the same fading in and out pattern as that but it was the opposite direction of fading.

Strange Red lights over Myrtle Beach;2007-10-18 21:30:00;5 minutes;Strange Red lights over Myrtle Beach I saw a round reddish object 5-10 times brighter than Mars 15-25 degrees above the horizon over the ocean. It faded out over a five second period. Within 30 seconds  I saw the same object several miles or degrees to the North. It also slowly faded out. I searched the sky for minutes looking for moving clouds or other circumstances which would have caused the fading lights. After about 3 minutes I had one last sighting, this time two lights right next to one another. They also faded out in 5 seconds.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
4 bright lights moving towards the ocean, then vanish into a cloud of lightning.;2013-06-11 09:43:00;1-2 minutes;4 bright lights moving towards the ocean, then vanish into a cloud of lightning. I was inside packing my bags for a trip I was taking. It was thundering outside but no rain or lighting. Suddenly my father screamed out from the deck &quotCOME OUTSIDE NOW!!!&quot.   I ran outside and he pointed up at the sky. I looked up and saw four rapidly (but randomly) flashing lights in a line.  My dad and I began asking each other what it could possibly be, as we were doing so the four lights shifted from a line into a rectangle in about 30 seconds.    These flashing white lights proceeded to move closer to the ocean at an exceedingly rapid pace.  Once they reached the ocean, lighting began shooting off from only the cloud that the lights disappeared into for about a minute.  Shortly thereafter there was no lightning, no thunder, and the clouds began to clear away.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Fireball lanterns in night sky seen at beach in SC;2013-07-23 23:00:00;15-30 seconds;Fireball lanterns in night sky seen at beach in SC On July 23, 2013, at 10:00 pm, I was standing on our hotels 6th floor balcony at Myrtle Beach, SC, looking at the beautiful full moon over the ocean.  I noticed a red object over the water - far to the left of the moon which appeared to be about a half mile down the beach over the water.  I thought maybe it was an airplane but it didn't move - just glowed red like a small fireball.   After about 15 seconds, it vanished.   That's when I noticed another object directly above me.  I looked up and it looked like a Chinese Lantern with fire burning at the bottom of it.   It moved slowly down the beach until it vanished.  I wasn't sure what it was.  And I was so amazed at looking at it, that I didn't take a picture of it.   There were lots of people outside at the beach.  Surely someone else saw this.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Orangish lights rising in the distance. Began to fade in and out as they went overhead. Then disappeared.;2017-09-09 20:08:00;3-4 minutes;Orangish lights rising in the distance. Began to fade in and out as they went overhead. Then disappeared. The lights seemed to be rising out of the northeast.  A little left of where the sun rises. Solid orangish lights from far away.  I thought they might be rising flares or low flying large planes.  But there were no sounds or blinking lights.  There were approx 3 separate groups of the same lights with 3-4 in each group.   As they got closer and overhead, the light would fade out.  Then it would light up 3 to 6 time as it flew overhead.  Sort of like a lightning bug.  But it was above the clouds, which were at least a couple thousand feet.   When overhead, they were more white than orange.  They seemed to be moving faster than a jet if it was 35,000 feet.  But only moving as fast as a fast small plane if it was a few hundred feet.  They covered way too much area, too fast and too high to be a drone, unless there are some serious long distance ones out there.  No blinks no sound at all.   They were rising 3 or 4 at a time.  And I might have seen 8 to 12.  Over a 2-3 minute pe! riod.  The lights were heading south west with no erratic movements, other than fading lights.  There was some sort of fast jet that flew over just prior to me seeing the first lights in the distance.  That was why I looked up in the first place.   It didn't sound like the normal commercial planes that frequent Myrtle Beach.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Orange lights moving in formation seen from the southern end of Myrtle Beach, SC.;2018-05-30 23:00:00;~20 minutes;Orange lights moving in formation seen from the southern end of Myrtle Beach, SC. I was recently visiting Myrtle Beach, SC, and awoke from a deep sleep and walked out onto the ocean front balcony of my room sometime after 10pm.  The moon was full and could occasionally be seen through dark rolling rain clouds.  I first saw a bright orange light seemingly just turn on at the edge of a dark cloud.  It was in my left field of vision. It disappeared and then another orange light appeared in my right field of vision also seeming to be at the edge of another dark cloud.  It disappeared, and then three orange lights appeared coming down into formation in a break in clouds.  They stopped in what appeared to be a perfect diagonal line.  The lower end was on my left as I looked out over ocean from the seventh floor.  It was as though they stopped to observe something.  Then two orange lights appeared with a greater distance between them.  It looked as though they were guiding a much larger object made of dark metal reflected by moonlight.  I only saw ! one end of the larger object which was round or oval and moving away from me into the clouds.  The orange lights looked like bright stars with spikes of light coming from them like bright objects often look in the night sky, but the spikes seemed more defined or like jewels would appear in bright light.  I am not sure about the time.  It was a restless night, and I did not even consider leaving to find my telephone to make pictures, but I now wonder why.  I think I was overwhelmed, and could not get my friend awake enough to look.  I hope someone else saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from the Myrtle Beach area for this date.

Large Cargo Plane Hovering.;2020-02-06 11:15:00;2 minutes;Largre Cargo Plane Hovering I saw a very large military cargo jet over Oak Street not far from the old Pavilion site. It was extraordinarily low. But that was not the strange thing. It appeared not to be moving... at all! At first, I though this was just an optical illusion since it was likely just flight very slowly and I was in a moving car going in the opposite direction.  However, when I stopped at a traffic light, I could clearly see the jet was actually motionless in the sky! I looked at it for at least 20 seconds while sitting still and it did not move at all in relation to the ground or my stationary car.  My thought was, I can't believe this. It's like time has stopped!  The people behind me at the light obviously also saw this as they were looking and pointing excitedly in that direction and talking to one another.  When the light changed, I drove to Oak Street (via 9th) to get closer to where the jet was hovering. As I turned the corner onto Oak, I saw black smoke start to pour from the jet's engines (which had not been there before)  as if it was throttling up and it started to accelerate and move like a normal jet. In fact, it began to move very fast and made a rather sharp right turn and disappeared over the treetops.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
