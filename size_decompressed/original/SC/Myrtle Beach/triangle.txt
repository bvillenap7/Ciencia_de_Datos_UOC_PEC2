we saw a large  bright orange circular lights that formed a v shaped pattern clearly then blink rapidly and disappear.;2011-09-29 21:00:00;5-10 min;we saw a large  bright orange circular lights that formed a v shaped pattern clearly then blink rapidly and disappear. I was driving south towards the ocean to pick up a friend for work between 9-9:30pm and directly in front of me in the sky was a large very bright round orange lights in a v pattern.  It was very clear. I stared at it through my windshield what seemed like a good 5 mins or so trying to figure out what it was. It certainly did not look like an airplane or anything else.  Then all of a sudden it started blinking really fast and disappeared.  Then I saw a smaller set of rapidly blinking lights directly next to it and then it just disappeared completely.  When I got to my friends I told her that I saw something crazy and didn't know if I was seeing things and she described it and said she had seen the same thing.   I talked to two other people that night who were at different locations at the same time who said that they had seen it as well and described it the same way.

Orange Orbs Form Equilateral Triangle.;2013-07-17 22:23:00;30 seconds;Orange Orbs Form Equilateral Triangle I began hearing a loud rumble, so I looked up into the sky searching for the cause.  After a few seconds, three orange orbs appear and form a perfect equilateral triangle.   The lights dropped in altitude slightly, all in perfect harmony, and disappear.  It was like the lights just turned off.  The noise disappeared instantly as well.   The more mysterious incident was that my cell phone would not work the battery was charged, but the screen kept turning on and off and I could not call anyone (even with full signal).

Orange lights in shape of triangle.;2013-07-22 22:00:00;5 seconds;Orange lights in shape of triangle. My Mother and I were sitting on the balcony at Bay View Resort on the Grand Strand around 10:00pm.  When suddenly two bright orange lights appeared over the beach and ocean.  They appeared to be horizontal to each other.  A third appeared that created a triangle form with the other two.   There was no sound and they were stationary.  They appear half the sized of the moon and twice as bright.  They appeared to be 4 inches apart from my view.  They disappeared about 5 seconds after appearing.   About 10 minutes later a jet plane of some sort flew in the vicinity.  It flew a few circles over the ocean and flew away.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
7 total objects seen in the sky coming from the vicinity of the ocean, triangular orange lights that seemed to pulsate, stop and hover;2013-11-28 19:00:00;15 minutes;7 total objects seen in the sky coming from the vicinity of the ocean, triangular orange lights that seemed to pulsate, stop and hover My Co-worker and I were on top of a parking deck talking and she saw the first one come off the ocean and hover, I looked up to see a triangular orange light that seemed to be pulsating and at a stand still.  It was close enough that had it been an aircraft we should have heard some type of noise, yet we did not.  Then 2 more came from the vicinity of the ocean and hovered with the first.  They then appeared to be getting smaller and we could tell that they were actually getting farther away from us.  Then they disappeared.   We were in shock and were talking about what we had just witnessed when two more in the same formation as the two that came in together before came in, stopped and hovered, then again started to ascend until they disappeared.  My husband came up and we were telling him what we had seen when a single object appeared coming from the ocean and it too hovered then started to ascend.  We talked for a couple of minutes then went upstairs into our of! fice.  I walked to the window to look one more time and another single object was in the sky in the same space as the others, I knocked on the window to get my husband's attention and pointed to it, and he too saw that one and we watched it until it disappeared like the others.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Orange lights (flying object) sequencing across sky over the ocean.;2014-05-27 22:50:00;15-25 seconds;orange lights (flying object) sequencing across sky over the ocean Started as one bright orange light that caught my eye from the 19th floor of a hotel balcony.   It was over the ocean then suddenly 4 lights around it making it a square shape with a light in the center then it suddenly started sequencing as if it had reproduced itself into 5-6 identical shapes all objects still lite up and they went in a straight line out going towards the shore into 5-6 identical shapes.  I called for my husband to wake up, and as he got to the balcony the lights all went out...about 10 seconds later three similar shapes appeared briefly (he saw) and then lights out again!   Crazy sighting-glad he saw it too! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Orange lights over Myrtle Beach.;2014-06-10 22:30:00;30 minutes;Orange lights over Myrtle Beach. My wife and I were sitting on the beach about 10:30 in North Myrtle Beach.  I heard my wife say, What the hell is that?   She said she saw three orange lights in the shape of a triangle out over the ocean.  I then saw one orange light.   A few minutes passed and the lights showed up again in front of us.  This time in a straight line pattern.   They would disappear as soon as we tried to take a picture.   They randomly showed up several times over the next half hour in different patterns and would fade away as quickly as they came.   Finally we saw the orange lights disappear and turn to fast blinking lights in three separate entities.   These three entities appeared to have lights blinking in a circular pattern and appeared to be heading inland until they disappeared.

Unexplained Triangular Flying Craft With Bright Lights At Myrtle Beach.;2014-06-23 09:30:00;2 hours;Unexplained Triangular Flying Craft With Bright Lights At Myrtle Beach. Around 9:30 on June 23rd my family and I decided to take a walk on the beach near pier 14 in Myrtle Beach.   As we were walking my husband first noticed one really bright light.   Then as we watched for over a period of 2 hours yellowish orange lights would appear in different formations then would disappear.    Finally the craft or flying object appeared and was very close to the shore. Two bright lights appeared and seemed to be about half a mile apart.   Then a third light and the craft seemed to be rotating in a circle.  This is how we could tell the shape of the ufo.  It had 3 distinct points.   I'm not sure what we watched for over two hours but have never seen that color of lights in the sky and the form andquickness of it.   I would love to get feedback or know if anyone knows for sure what it is.   We were able to record a few seconds of the lightsâ€¦;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Triangular shape with arched front white lights and red flashing lights, stationary for over an hour, seen by 2 people 3 miles apart.;2016-03-15 02:00:00;>1 hour;Triangular shape with arched front white lights and red flashing lights, stationary for over an hour, seen by 2 people 3 miles apart. Saw a friend's Facebook post asking what were the red lights in sky over Socastee/Burgess, SC.   I went out side and saw stationary lights ..that could be missed as stars..it was a bright night but there was lightening off in distance over ocean.  A plane flew by at about the same altitude and I could see the difference because it was moving..  The shape was an arched triangle, wide in front with line of whit lights and red flashing in center.  There were more lights inside the trianglular shape which is what made it clear.   I wondered if it could be a weather balloon or drone.  There was no noise..I came back out 3 times to veiw it and it never moved.  There was no sound but it was very big up and impossible to photograph on my iPad or phone..probably would have been quite clear by telescope.  Sighting confirmed by my friend.   I also saw much larger clearer triangular moving lights between Pine Bush and Walden in Orange County, NY, in the 80s, confirmed by many people, who also saw it.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Triangular Fire object slowly lifts off the coast, then moves south at a steady rate of speed while increasing altitude.;2016-05-22 22:00:00;1 minute;Triangular Fire object slowly lifts off the coast, then moves south at a steady rate of speed while increasing altitude. Fire triangular object slowly lifts off ground (I noticed it when object was approx 200 feet off ground) on the shore of the Atlantic, then at a steady rate of speed, moves in a southern direction all while going farther up in the night sky.  Did not shoot across the sky, but was going as fast as a plane does.    Thought it may have been a firework at first, then I thought it could of been a hot air balloon...  I have ruled both out and am left with it being unexplained.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
