Unknown lights in Myrtle Beach.;2014-10-22 20:45:00;10 minutes;unknown lights in myrtle beach Last night my roommate and I were sitting on my front porch, the time was between 20:45 and 21:15.  I was stargazing and just looking around because it was a clear, very crisp night for South Carolina, I looked left and noticed about 4-5 lights all in a row, orange, red and white hues (almost like track lighting) just above the trees.  I said to my friend do you see that and he acknowledged the same thing I was seeing.  I got up to walk to the driveway to get a better view and the lights completely disappeared.  We may have only witnessed it for about 20 seconds.  After about five minutes of trying to figure out what we saw we walked down the driveway to the road to see if we could see it anywhere else in the sky and we didnâ€™t.  We did however then notice about 3 white blinking lights in a line at first close together and the pretty far apart going through the sky very fast, we thought maybe fighter planes? These planes started at the area where we first saw! the lights and we watched them until they were out of site, they did not disappear just flew out of visual range.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

All of the sudden 5 red lights in a straight line appeared out of nowhere.30 seconds later they disappeared just as quickly.  My wife and I noticed them reappearing again what looked to be about 2 or 3 miles to the north.  At this time there are only 4 lights in a straight line.  Then about 30 seconds later it instantly disappeared again.  Then a couple of more miles to the north 1 light appeared then disappeared within a couple of seconds.  About 1 minute later one of the lights that looked identical to the others reappeared at the same point where they began.  The UFO looked to be bigger than two aircraft carriers in length and definitely at least a couple thousand feet in the air!;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
