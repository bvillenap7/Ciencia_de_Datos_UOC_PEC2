7 Colored Balls of Light seen north of beach acess at 82nd Ave N. in Myrtle Beach,SC  Aug 1986;1986-08-20 00:30:00;3 mins;7 Colored Balls of Light seen north of beach access at 82nd Ave N. in Myrtle Beach,SC  Aug 1986 A  girlfriend and I were walking on the beach north of 82nd Ave North in Myrtle Beach, SC.  There are no Hotels and no lights on this area of the beach.  It was a clear night.  We were sitting on the beach looking out toward the ocean when my friend pointed out the light that were coming up the beach. 6 Balls of light.  All playing follow the leader.  The Balls were of different colors Blue, Green, Red, and Orange. The first 3 balls were the size of SOFTBALLS held at arms length. The last 3 were the size of a golf ball held at arms lenght.  We saw the Balls travel from the south going north follow the coast line. The Objects were about 200 Yards out over the surf.  The water was very calm that night and there was no breeze.  The Balls were casting no reflection on the water.  They were at most 100 feet above the water.  We heard no sound from the objects.Speed of objects above 100mph plus or minus. The six Balls passed by and went another 50 or son yards and went straight up. They traveld upwards for about 10 seconds and were gone.  About 1 minute later small red ball was seen travling at a HIGH rate of speed following the same path as the 6 before came by us, went up, and was gone.   Total time of sighting was about 3- 4 mins. I was a LifeGuard on the Beach not far from were we saw these Objects.  My friend i meet that week on the beach.  I am from Myrtle Beach  She was from Ohio. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

3 disk shaped rotating objects emitting bright orange lights over Atlantic Ocean.;2001-06-15 23:00:00;5 minutes;3 disk shaped rotating objects emitting bright orange lights over Atlantic Ocean. While standing on my first floor balcony I noticed a bright orange light over the water several hundred yards away.  An exact distance would be impossible to tell from the human eye but it could not have possibly been more than 1-2 miles from shore.  I pointed it out to my friends asking if it was a planet and as soon as we all caught sight of it it disappeared.  One of my friend claimed it was probably an airplane passing behind the clouds.  It quickly reappeared what looked like some hundred yards away and then disappeared once again.  About 2 minutes later we noticed a large orange glowing streak that looked like a falling star that was frozen in time, motionless.  Then this obeject slowly made a revolution clearly revealing a disk shape.  As this object slowly rotated a new light would appear which conclusively showed us the disk like shape.  Upon gazing at this slowly rotating object, my friend pointed out another craft displaying the same exact behavior.  An orange central light, with one orange light becoming visible with each rotation and orange lights displayed on the sides.  We then noticed the third identical object displaying the same behavior.  The three crafts seemed to reveal themselves in the order of left to right, slowly rotating and hovering above the Atlantic Ocean. These crafts made no identifiable sound though it was very windy.  Suddenly, all of the orange lights emitted from the three crafts went out.  They disappeared. About 3 minutes later we saw these disk shaped figures flying to our northwest, diagonally out of sight.  These crafts no longer emitted the glowing orange lights but now displayed what appeared to be multiple strobe lights around the edges.  Without these strobe lights around the perimeters of these crafts they would not have been visible to us.  We could only make out what appeared to be three ovular structures surrounded by strobe lights on the edges flying away from us in the northwest direction and out of our sight.  The first two were flying in a line in tandem with one another and the third following up in the rear.  This formed what appeared to be a triangular formation by which they exited from our view.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
orangish yellowish sphere over the ocean at myrtle beach s. c.;2003-09-09 22:00:00;approx 10 min.;orangish yellowish sphere over the ocean at myrtle beach s. c. My girlfriends and I were sitting on the beach the night before the full moon looking at Mars. While we were talking I looked out over the ocean and saw an orangish yellowish what looked like a star but much larger.It faded out after just a couple seconds.By the time my brain processed what I saw it was gone. I told my friends that I saw a strange light and I wished they had seen it. They laughed at this and we continued talking. After about 10 min. it appeared again this time my friends saw it also. It moved behind a cloud and showed up way to the left of us over the water after about 1 min. It then dissappeared again and showed up after about 30 sec. the first place I noticed it. It disappeared again and we never saw it again. One of my friends said it appeared to have red around the edge of the light. My vision is more distance challanged than hers so I could not dispute that. I reported this on this site on 09/12/03 but for some reason it didnt show up. I was checking the site 09/13/03 to see if anyone else had reported and saw another sighting at the same time but mine wasn't listed. I did notice that we wern't the only ones in myrtle beach that night that saw the strange lights. Would love to know what they were.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
yellowish orangish looked like a star but larger moving erraticly disappearing and reappearing in different places;2003-09-09 23:30:00;2-3 min.;yellowish orangish looked like a star but larger moving erraticly disappearing and reappearing in different places My girlfriends and I were on a vacation at myrtle beach s.c. on the night of sept 9th we were sitting on the beach at approx. 11:30 pm talking and marveling at how close Mars was to our moon. Conversation drifted off in other directions when something caught my eye over the ocean a good ways above the horizion. It was ayelow orangish light that looked at first as a large star would. It faded out in just a matter of a second or two. My mind couldn't process what I was seeing before it was gone. I said to my 2 friends that I had just seen some strang light that I wished they had seen before it disappered. They kinda laughed at me and we went on talking. About 5-10 minutes later it appeared again in a simelar position, this time both of my friends saw it also. It would stay for a few seconds then it went behind a cloud. We continued to watch the area when it appeared over the horizon way to our left. again it was there only a second and changed position again closer to where I first noticed it. This time when it disapeared we did not see it again. Its change of position was not in the pattern of a plane we didnt hear any aircraft in the area. We all 3 agree that it was the strangest thing we have ever seen. One of my friends thought she could see reddish edges to the light, my eyesight is more distance challenged than hers so I can't disput that. We are women in our 50's and I assure you we don't know what it was but we do know it was real. We want to know what it may have been we saw and hoping that there is a reasonable explaination for this. We were unable to find anyone else that saw a strange light that night. Can anyone tell us anything.                      ((initials and professions deleted));33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

While on vacation in Myrtle Beach South Carolina I was fishing on the peer and spotted a group of flying objects hovering over and very near the Myrtle Beach airport.  They appeared to round objects and were a white metallic color.  The sky was crystal clear. The objects appeared to be moving in a formation very slow at first and then accelerated out of sit in a few seconds. The objects traveled in a formation of four to five on top forming arch and a single round object on the bottom. Many people on the peer on the your witness to the sitting and tried to explain what they had seen.

One Object, mostly stationary but finally moved at a rapid pace away at 10 pm. I went out of the porch with my husband.  Our porch faces the east, and this object was more southern.  it blinked red and green lights, and they appreard to be in a sphere like shape. It was  in the sky, for about 20 minutes, all of a sudden I saw another object moving towards it, and the 1st sighted object moved up to the sky, straight up, in very rapidy and it began to emit only the red lights, moving a very fast pace, followed my a shooting star in almost the same location.  The object disappeared, then came back into view. It was a sphere like object, and definitly not a star.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
I observed orange lights off of the coast.;2008-02-20 19:45:00;5 Minutes;I observed orange lights off of the coast. I was on vacation in Myrtle Beach this week and I had stepped out of my hotel room which faced the beach. It was a nice night, a bit windy and cool with a full moon with increasing cloud cover.  From the balcony on the fifth floor room, I observed as the clouds began to obscure the moon a orange spherical light appeared from the cloud cover drifting against the wind to the east.  A second one appeared as the first one blinked out. The second one stayed in place and faded out.  Another light appeared still drifting to the east and blinked out.  Finally three lights blinked on simulatneously in a staggered line formation and a fourth one appeared to the left of the formation before zooming into line with the others. The formation tightened up and I left the balcony to get my wife outside to see this. When we both came back out, there were no lights. We waited for 15 minutes but nothing else appeared.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

I was standind on my back porch when a light in the sky caught my eye. I starred for a bit at it when all of a sudden a total of three lights appeared. Sphere shaped, white, yellowish lights danced across the sky at an unbelievable rate of speed.  I watch for a few minutes when all of a sudden the lights disappeared. I finished the cig I was smoking and flipped it in the yard when two fighter jets of some sort flew over my home. I went in the house told my wife, and then fell asleep. I went to work then next day and a co-worker was talking about a possible UFO they had saw the same night I saw the lights in the sky. We compared notes and proceded to investigate via the internet. To our suprise, several people noticed the activity on May 27, 2009. There is even a video that was posted on youtube.com about the encounter. For a couple of nights the lights above the Grand Strand appeared. I don't think we are alone on earth!

Orange lights appearing in half-circle formation over the shoreline of Myrtle Beach.;2009-10-08 21:00:00;45 mins.;Orange lights appearing in half-circle formation over the shoreline of Myrtle Beach. Offshore, we noticed one orange light NE up the shoreline, come on for a few seconds and fade out.  About 5 mins. later a formation of these same spherical lights appeared much closer to us, just past and above the 1st Ave.N. pier. They formed a triangle, stayed lit for a few seconds and then faded out.  Some 10 mins. or so later, they appeared offshore, just up above the horizon, directly across from our viewpoint.  A total of 5 or 6 of these lights appeared, one by one, first 3 in a curved line (quite similar, in fact, to the Phoenix light UFO's)on the right, then 2 more on the left side of the curved formation.  Then, just as they faded into view, they would fade out of view one by one.  We saw some more of these lights over the next 15 mins. noticing higher up in the sky a pattern of very faint white or blue star-like lights appearing immediately before the larger orange lights down low, almost as if they were beckoning or transmitting to each other.

Large bright lights in half moon shape over ocean along coast.;2012-08-07 22:00:00;2 minutes;Large bright lights in half moon shape over ocean along coast. We were in the water just after dark in front of the Best Western on the surf side.  There were 5 or 6 very bright lights that appeared to the south.  All were in a half moon shape and seemed fairly distant from one another but also seemed like they were all in line in the half moon shape.  They all came on, and then went off and then back on in random order. Not flares for sure.  Then later about 10 minutes,one glowed again by it's self but not the others. I asked another family walking by if they seen it and they said yes and that they just saw the same thing further north about 30 minutes earlier and we both agreed we have never seen anything like it before.   I am prior service in the Army and have seen choppers and A10 shoot their flares out in the day and night while serving in Iraq.  This was certainly not the same thing. Very strange how they were all in perfect position in a half moon shape. Later there was some sort of plane that flew in the direction of ! the spheres that seemed to fly as fast as a jet but the spheres were quite a ways away and over the ocean so I could not tell what kind of plane it was. Also, a helicopter flew quite a ways out over the ocean in a circle around the surf, much further out that what the tourist choppers have been flying. I don't know what it was, but as far out as the spheres were and as bright as they were would make me think that it was not a normal occurrence. My son, myself, and the 3 other people from the other family, that I know of, seen this happen.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Ten to 15 bright red orbs independently moving and blinking on and off over the ocean.;2012-11-08 21:20:00;20 minutes;Ten to 15 bright red orbs independently moving and blinking on and off over the ocean. I was in a second floor condo on the North end of Myrtle Beach, SC that is oceanfront on a beach that faces to the SE.  I was starting to doze but I awoke at about 9:20 pm because my ears were ringing loudly.  I had an urge to go outside on the balcony and look at the sky.  The water was calm like glass and it was eerily quiet. It was a clear, dark night with Jupiter and stars of Orion’s belt shining brightly to the E.  (Sirius had not yet risen and moonrise was after midnight.)  So I called my friend, B out to see them.  We both saw a sudden flash of bright pinkish-red, dime-size round light SE at about 2 finger widths above and closer than the horizon over the ocean.  The center was the darker pink-red and the perimeter was a red-orange.  I am guessing it was closer than a mile as the visibility was 10 miles at the time.   It blinked out then flashed on and off again.  She kept asking, What is that? and I grabbed her arm.  In about 30 seconds it flashed on from a greater distance for about 3 seconds.  Then it blinked off for a second.  Then further away there was another red light that separated into two side by side lights about one finger width apart, then rejoined as one (or one was in front of the other).   Then I saw another one higher and more towards the SSE.  (At some point my friend went inside for a few seconds to get a coat.  Unfortunately we did not have our cameras at the ready.)  A larger/closer red flash to the SSE stayed on a little longer so I could see a grayish area with the red light in its center, with all outlined in a blackish ring.  One of the red lights traveled SE to ESE parallel to the shoreline.  Then we started seeing small pinpoints of white light (10 or more of them) between that one (to our left) and the others and a little higher altitude.  They blinked on and off but the light from some of them was so bright that we could feel it on our eyes (like tiny flashbulbs).  Some seemed to be getting closer to us.  Some turned red but stayed small.  Two more flashes of red light appeared and rotated or orbited around each other.  Then two small red lights flashed briefly and at differing spacing from each other (as two separate objects).  They stayed lit, rose and headed off to the SSW.  We went out the front door but the height and lighting of the other buildings prevented us from seeing them.  We saw no more of these lights but saw the white, red and green blinking lights of an approaching small plane.  The plane was coming up the beach offshore probably having taken off from the airport at the south end of Myrtle Beach.  We could hear the faint sounds from the plane.  Otherwise, we heard NO sounds other than the gentle wave sound.  At 9:45 pm we came inside and each independently wrote down what we had just experienced.  Weather Conditions:  43 degrees, clear, dew point 36 degrees, wind W at 8, pressure 30.10 rising, visibility 10 miles.

Several orbs observed by 2 witnesses.;2018-09-07 20:10:00;10-15 minutes;several orbs observed by 2 witnesses. 2 observers, husband and wife, simultaneously observed several (7-10) hovering orbs in the vast night sky of different sizes, colors and locations.  The brightest was the furthest south location, the 2nd brightest which was multicolored, was the furthest north and west.  There were about 7 others which were much smaller and white appearing in between the distance of the aforementioned 2. The sighting lasted about 10-15 minutes as we went inside while they were still present.  There was one large orb which was solid white (the southern most) in color.  Most of the rest were tiny in comparison and appeared further away.  There was one furthest away from the largest white one which appeared multicolored.  After viewing with the naked eye for about 2 minutes, my wife got binoculars and we could see the surface of these orbs were not one solid light, but much smaller lights making up their mass, reminiscent of an LED flashlight or golf ball dimple configuration.  Upon viewing the multicolored 2nd largest orb, the shape was clearly a triangle which seemed to have changing color lights.  Some red/orange, green, yellow and white.  There was no discernible movement of the orbs, they were just hovering in one spot.  We went inside after viewing them for approximately 15 minutes. I took 3 poor quality photos with my phone before going inside. I sent a report to MUFON and just before downloading 3 photos, I decided to go outside and see if they were still there.  The largest white one was gone, and didnt see but a couple of the much smaller ones.  However, the multicolored triangular one was still in the same location and one of the other smaller ones was now larger and appeared closer and it appeared to change colors as well as very slowly moving from south to north.  I didnt have the binoculars with me so I couldn't see detail.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Red-orange lights over Myrtle Beach;2019-10-08 23:00:00;4 or 5 min;Red-orange lights over Myrtle Beach I was at Myrtle Beach with my elderly mother and her two friends for the week. It was a Tuesday night on Oct. 8. The ladies were already in bed for the night and I was out on a 3rd floor hotel balcony overlooking the beach boardwalk. I was drinking bourbon at the time.  It was around 23:00 and as I looks northward up the beach, I noticed Orangish Red lights in the air moving south following the beach. Weather was very cloudy and these lights were below the clouds. There was southward wind around 10 mph. as we were having poor weather last few days.  I first glance I thought all the tourist helicopters were flying down the beach with a landing or spotlight on. I though it was cool, an evening air show of sorts. But then the several lights started dropping other reddish orange lights from the bottom. Just like them but smaller. These lights descended a bit and disappeared. First thought was roman candles or flares.  I then noticed there was no sound coming from the objects. The tourist helicopters were loud, and I should be hearing them, but I wasn’t. As they drew closer. Still dropping their lights. I noticed there was no red or green wing tip lights. Just the reddish glow of the objects themselves. But still no engine noise.  As first one was in front of the hotel and myself, I noticed no white blinking tail light either. Just a spherical light at about a 45-degree angle, below the clouds.  And still no noise. It was at this time I woke my mother to look and see if she was seeing what I was seeing. She started watching the event mid-way through and also wondered what they were and also noticed no sound from them. The objects were still continuing to drop other lights. This entire time. My thinking if these were flares, they would illuminate the ground or water, but didn’t. they just dropped and dissipated. They were dropping light so frequently, there would be three small lights under the main. As the forth light would drop the first would dissipate. After 8 or 10 moved by the last one in the formation which unlike the others, was not dropping lights came by, and as they moved south disappeared into the low clouds. The objects in front were still dropping lights as I could no longer see them but the dropped lights still appeared as they fell below the clouds. This entire event lasted 4 or 5 min.  I still have no clue what I saw. I have considered drones, but cannot explain the dropping of the lights. I have considered candle balloons as they were moving south with a southern wind direction with pieces of the burning materials falling off. But the straight-line formation along with the regularity of the dropping lights discounts that to me. I frequent airshows. I am a fan of military aviation, and I can identify aircraft as I see them fly over. Not being able to explain this is irritating to me. I do not believe in UFOs. I still don’t. However, there is video footage online that is very similar to what I saw. And I finally realized I had a cell phone to record this and I did video the last sphere as it went by. But as I said. It was not dropping lights like the others so I have no proof of that activity.  If I was to describe this in UFO terms. Foo Fighter seems to match.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
