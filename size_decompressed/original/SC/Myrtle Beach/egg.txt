Large ghostly shape like a stacked hamburger almost transparent and extremely large prodominantly white.;2007-12-31 23:53:00;25 seconds;Large ghostly shape like a stacked hamburger almost transparent and extremely large prodominantly white. We were getting ready to celebrate the new year and from the northeast over the ocean, a large object in the shape of a highly stacked hamburger (best I can describe the shape ) passed right over our heads traveling southeast. It was mostly a whitish light (almost ghostly or see through )with several other colored lights in and around the edges of it. From the distance we were positioned it appeared to be the size of two or three hot air balloons on top of each other. I would say that it lasted 15 - 25 seconds and must have been traveling 500 to 700 mph. It was overcast so I could tell it was below the clouds. If there was a powerful enough spotlight on the ground that could produce this and size, shape , and detail then I would say thats what we saw due to the transparency and the way it floated across the sky with no noise, but it is definitely something I have never experienced before.
