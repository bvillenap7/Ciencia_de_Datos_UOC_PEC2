I was on the 14th floor of Ocean Creek apartment in Myrtle Beach, facing the ocean, when I saw this bright light shooting from the sky at first I thought it was a shooting star or maybe it was a plane that was going down the object from me was slowly move in but it could've been going really really fast it was heading down is if it was going to hit the ocean and then it broke off into two piece.  When it broke off the object was of circular form.  It then was in the sky for a few minutes and then it disappeared.  I have pictures and video of the object,;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
