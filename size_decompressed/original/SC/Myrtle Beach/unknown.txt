4 Lights appeared in myrtle beach.;2004-09-15 21:00:00;10 seconds;4 Lights appeared in myrtle beach Well this is the first I've ever mentioned this event in my life, never really knowing what I saw.  I had recently broke my leg and had just gotten into my walking cast.  I was walking home from a friends house and in front of me 4 orange lights appeared, not seaming to be very far away, and one by one they dimmed out and went away.  They were still and did not move from their position in the sky.  Thing of a square on its corner with all 4 corners pointing north, south, east, and west. The lights appeared at the points of the square almost in a diamond shape.  There were no street lights in the area which allows me to believe I would have seen the shape of the object, yet I saw nothing but the lights.  I have been thinking about this day for years and everything I think it could be I rule out from common knowledge. It couldn't have been an airplane or helicopter for there was no noise. Nor a weather balloon as the lights would have continued to appear as it rose up and away. A flair is out of the question for it rises and falls. There are no cell or any kind of towers in the direction I was facing.  I don't know what I saw but, it was definitely something I haven't seen before or since.

lights moving closer and farther away same direction and still at one point and a ufo lighting up the sky with its red/orange light;2004-09-16 20:15:00;10 mins;lights moving closer and farther away same direction and still at one point and a ufo lighting up the sky with its red/orange light It is dark and cloudy on the beach. All of a sudden I notice 3 blinking lights in the sky staying still, then all of a sudden they start moving out to sea. one of the blinking lights moves over to another then back to its orginal position. if you were to draw straight lines to each they would have formed a right triangle. After they were out of viewing distance another single blinking light comes across the sky. 3 times did this ufo let off a light that lasted about 5 seconds each time and it was a orange redish glow that only shot upwards. That was it but remember during all of this it is cloudy no stars are visible.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
White lights, in unison, left to right, not change in velocity, direction, or speed, much too large for a normal A/C;2004-12-07 19:05:00;10 Seconds;White lights, in unison, left to right, not change in velocity, direction, or speed, much too large for a normal A/C Heading East on the highway, about 60 degrees above eye level, well above any city lights, there were 5 consecutive large, white lights, perfectly in unison. From left to right, one would flash brilliantly with a slow burn on, then a slow burn off. then the second, then the 3rd and so on... these lights appeared to be perfectly level during the pattern, with no direction changes, nor any running lights to speak of, just pure white lights. Night background was dark, and although there is an  public (MYR) airport in the area, object, would have had to landed sharply and aggresively to even possibly be a plane, or helicopter. I worked Sikorsky Jayhawks for 3 years and my wife and I both spent time in the service underway on the open seas with plenty of nights on lookout watch and have NEVER seen anything close to resembling this.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Video taped the object and noticed that it released a smaller flashing light.  Watching in slow motion it appeared to pulsate and at times would almost completely vanish in a puff of smoke and then the light would intensify.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Bright Lights over the Atlantic Ocean;2009-01-13 04:45:00;10 minutes;Bright Lights over the Atlantic Ocean Hello, My name is Al Gohl and I live in Myrtle Beach this morning at 04:45 January 13, 2009 I stepped outside to smoke on my back porch. I noticed one bright light at first sitting stationary over the Atlantic ocean at first glance I thought it was a plane but realized that it was just sitting there then I noticed a second light of to the right side and down from the other light I watched these lights for about ten minutes just sitting there not moving I’ve lived near airports and usually they will come in back to back so I’m used to that and it wasn’t anything like this. I would also like to point out I served six Years in the military and I know what flares are and how they move so this wasn’t any flares. Well thanks for your time I wanted to share this information with you I goggled to see if there were other reports and found that this wasn’t the first time someone has seen lights on the Atlantic Ocean.

Tonight around the same time we were waiting to see if they appeared again.  They did but were more northerly.  There was a bit of overcast so visibility was not that good.  They appeared to blink on then blink off and the lights were red.  Not a plane or flares.  The lights also appeared to change positions rapidly or else they were turning off and on lights around it's perimeter.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Observation, numerous times, orange lights to the East of Myrtle Beach, SC.;2012-10-24 20:40:00;2 minutes;Observation, numerous times, orange lights to the East of Myrtle Beach, SC. My wife and I have seen these orange orbs/lights on and off for the last 3 or 4 years. I accessed this site several years ago to see if someone else has seen this phenomena.  Tonight was the first time we have seen these lights for several months,and no one we have spoken to has seen them. We spend a lot of time on our back porch which faces due East, and have been observing this &quotlight show&quot for several years now. We have never heard any sound of overhead aircraft, seen strobe lights from aircraft, or any such visible or audial evidence of any terrestial craft involved with these sightings.  The duration of the &quotorange globes&quot is usually a matter of 1, 2 or 3 seconds, at most. Usually they appear in singular, but tonight we saw several &quotbatches&quot of 3 to 4 at one time. As an addendum, last year about this time, we saw a series of these orbs passing from North to South, and then turning to the right, and headed West out of sight. These lights individually stayed visible for relatively longer periods of time than the &quotnormal&quot sightings we've had. In other words, they stayed visible for periods of up to 20 seconds, whereas the lights we usually have been observing last approximately 2 to 3 seconds, at most. We would be most appreciative if anyone could enlighten us at to the origin and substance of these lights, as they have been puzzling us for quite some time. Thank you very much.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Light had something fall from bottom which then turned into another light of the same kind.  This soon split into more until there were 3 hovering together. The lights were extremely bright, and hovering irregularly. They looked to be a diamond or egg shape, but definitely not perfect circles. There was no sound emitted from the objects, and shortly after they fell behind the tree line I saw planes circling the vicinity. I could hear the plane engines, so I know it was not a plane. This emitted no sound. I have short video footage of the lights hovering. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD));33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Triangular shaped dark orange light. Very large in the direction of the ocean.;2013-09-27 21:20:00;4 seconds;Triangular shaped dark orange light. Very large in the direction of the ocean. While jogging around 9:20 PM something caught my eye in the direction of the Ocean (I was about 5 miles inland.   I focused on what at first I thought had to be an airplane but it definitely was not. It was large and probably over the ocean, but it appeared to have 2 ribbon like curved lights, almost like a belt but not quite.  The shape was Triangular but not a steep triangle.    It was a dark orange light, and lit up for a half second and then the light faded very quickly.  I stopped dead in my tracks and it did it again, same spot -same lights.  It almost appeared as if something was attempting to power up and the lights came on very briefly and then faded very quickly.    I took out my phone, hoping to get a chance to film it, but it never re-appeared.  Nothing, just dead silence. I've never seen anything like it...It was very strange.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

They would shine bright and glow.  There were no navigational lights like on planes.  Some of them were together and some of them spread out.  They stayed on for about 3 seconds.  The time between sightings was about 5 minutes.  I could not hear any engine noise because ot was windy.  Most of the lights appeared to be  stationary while durring some sightings they moved.

Object with red then white lights seen over the ocean 3 separate times in different locations.;2018-07-10 23:00:00;30 minutes;Object with red then white lights seen over the ocean 3 separate times in different locations. My boyfriend and I were on vacation and sitting on the balcony overlooking the beach.  We were looking at a very bright reddish color star which we found out was Mars via the skyview app.   All of the sudden, something appeared in the distance over the ocean close to where we were seeing Mars.  It had red lights that seemed to be in certain places around the object.  The red lights dimmed and white lights followed in a straight line around the object.  The line of lights trailed off with the end of the string of lights disappearing before the front. Approximately 10-15 minutes later, the exact same thing happened again, this time to the left of the original sighting.  This time, a man sitting on the ground level patio alone turned around.  We asked if he saw anything and he replied “what the heck was that thing?!”  He also mentioned the red and white lights. Another 10-15 minutes later, we spotted the object again further down the beach.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
