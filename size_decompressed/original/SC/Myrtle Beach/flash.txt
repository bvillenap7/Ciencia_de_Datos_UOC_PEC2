lights in the middle of the ocean.......;2004-11-28 03:30:00;30 mins;lights in the middle of the ocean....... I was unable to tell the shape of the craft i was viewing, but i can assure that this object was stationary for well over 30 mins and is still there as i type this. me and my fiance have been at this same location for about a week now and this is the first time we have witnessed this light although the lights resembled a commercial aircraft the lights were continous in there placement over the ocean and would appear and disapear frequently. A bright flashing of red white and another unexplainable color were displayed but in more of a sequence of rotations around the object though it was to far away to determine the size, shape, or color of the craft im sure it was nothing commercial......we observed it for quite a while and it never moved and unbenounced to my knowledge there are no towers or structures with these lights that far out in the ocean or that high in altitude off the coast of south carolina....i just went and looked to see if the lights were still there but some substantial cloud cover has rolled in since i started typing this.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Red Flashing Lights Over the Atlantic;2006-07-29 22:00:00;22:00 - 23:30;Red Flashing Lights Over the Atlantic It was about 10:00 PM on tuesday august 29, my elderly mother had told me to come outside on the porch, and to look out above the ocean, she had told me that she had seen an orange-red lighted ball flash on for about two seconds then flash off almost as if it were a rotating beacon on a plane. She said she had seen the flashes of light the night before but did not want to tell me, because I might think she was insane. so i stood out looking over the ocean for about 10-15 min. then i saw what apeared to be a redish flash of light come on then go off within a second or so, i at first thought it was a plane, then i saw the same light apeare a little bit to the left of the last light then fade out now i thought it was just a plane moving to the north, but within a few minutes i saw the same light again in the exact same spot as the first light to the south.(let me add that the ball of lights themselfs do not move) next i saw someting that really freeked me out, the light to the north lit back up with three other lights almost apearing out of eachother. then i thought how the hell can a plane move from the south to the north then back to the south and then back to the north giving birth to two other objects all within a few minutes. this sighting of either a ufo or a plane realy scared me and my mother. me and my family have been visiting myrtle beach for years and now own a house on the beach an we both have never seen anything quite like this, and by reading other reports of these sightings in the area we would love to know what caused these flashes of lights over the ocean? we have asked family members that have spent their lives in the airforce and do not know of any aircraft that can emite these types of lights. Please, any type of explination would be helpful.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

They appeared in various locations over a span of 15 min.  I also saw a sequence of 5 lights in a linear formation light up and fade out.    I'm also an aviator and these lights were not aircraft recognition lights, landing lights, or flares.  Very neat sighting!!!

Flashing red and white looked like 4 or more flashing objects, bouncing back and forth in a pattern over the Atlantic Ocean.;2012-11-08 23:00:00;15 Minutes;Flashing red and white looked like 4 or more flashing objects, bouncing back and forth in a pattern over the Atlantic Ocean On 11-08-12 Thursday night, my wife told me about so loud music & singing across from our home. We were standing on our front porch listening to music, and spotted Flashing lights over the ocean infront of our home.  They could no have been far out to be able to see them infront of us.   These Flashing lights were red and white, and they were jumping across, back and forth, but these stayed inside one area with a constant pattern of moving together as they flashed. But it may have been one object that had all of these lights flashing, but No Sound! It was late, but The Sky was Clear,and There were no planes around at that time frame, We only saw them for about 10-15 minutes left in a flash and just like they appeared togather, they We live only 2 miles from the Airport, and when they talke off, we can see about all of them. Our home is on Stilts and two story,  So that puts us up pretty high up. We could see the ocean before they built houses across the lake from us. I called them to report it, and The Airport give me a number at the FFA. I called  to report it, and was telling him what I saw, and he stopped me.  He said he was going to put me on Speaker phone, and he wanted me to start over.  I told him what my wife and I saw the night before, and many of other different object sightings, out over the Atlantic Ocean,  But they were straight in front of us. I have seen moreo objects that I will add to more of these Description forms.  The man I spoke with told me to type up everything I had told him, and mail it to him, and I told him of other sightings I had seen, and he said to include them and the dates and places of them all.   The gentleman got back intouch with me, and he said to fill out this form. So because there are more sighting, you will see more listed with my name on them. Thanks,;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Not dropping like a flare.  I am ex military and I know how flares work.  These were not flares.  They continued to move east ward out into ocean.  Tiny but bright quickly flashing sparkles.  Yet Sparkled back to their moving positions which was fast.  Not fireworks but something moving across sky.  Quick flashing eastward in unison.  Then they disappeared and I then saw lower orangeish brighter lit flashes in the sky where they had been and they lasted for about a minute and moved east as well.   I doubt Chinese candles as they were quick sparkles and I also know what Chinese candles look like.  These were flickering UFO's.  In uniform that were there for a couple minutes and then gone.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Come to Myrtle Beach and see for yourself...seeing is believing.;2014-06-10 22:00:00;45 minutes;Come to myrtle beach and see for yourself...seeing is believing. I was checking out some UFO reports and was giving up for the night, when I notice two bright orange lights, just south west of me.  After about a few seconds they disappeared.  I started walking toward the beach again, then all of a sudden, I  saw the lights due east of me, blinking on and off for about 20 minutes.  I took my eye of them for a second after that, and they broke up into about 6 smaller lights, and flew away, blinking very fast.. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above to reflect a sighting on Tuesday night, June 10th, 2014.  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he stated that the sighting was Tuesday night.

I have all this on video as well,to verify my story so that this occurrence is not overlooked.  Extremely amazing but at the same time out of this world.  I forgot to mention moments later fire trucks were dispatched for something I'm assuming as I heard the fire horn roaring in the quiet night.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
