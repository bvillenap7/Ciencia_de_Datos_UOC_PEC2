Odd lights seen over ocean in Myrtle Beach, SC.;1995-07-01 03:15:00;15 seconds;Odd lights seen over ocean in Myrtle Beach, SC. I happened to be on a hotel balcony looking at the stars on a very clear night and five lights approx the size of stars passed my vision.  They were in a typical fighter pattern(V) so I thought they were aircraft at very high altitudes flying extremely fast.  My girlfriend was next to me and I tried to point them out.  When they were about in front of me they stopped and appeared to stop and quickly moved into an circle.  After a few seconds they abruptly took off in different directions at jaw dropping speeds.  I know this sounds nuts and I doubt my own eyes but this is what I saw.  The date is wrong but I know it was summertime. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
One orange light split into two lights over the ocean .;2002-08-18 21:45:00;3 sec.;One orange light split into two lights over the ocean . The observers are 2 female ages, 22 and 24. We were sitting on the beach looking over the ocean. Somewhere between 2-4 miles out over the ocean at about low cloud level we saw a light. The light started as one point in the sky and immediately split into two lights. They went horizontally away from eachother. The light that went to the right faded first. Immediately after the light to the left faded in the same fashion. The lights that we saw were an orange color.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Several of us from diferent area of the country meet there a couple of times a year. It happend to be a very nice clear night. There was over 10 adults in ages from 54-72 sitting out talking and enjoying the nice evening. All of a suden out over the ocean several miles out I saw this light. It was very HOT in color and looked as though it wa moving very fast on a horizonal line with sevral pulse bursts. I hollard and one other person saw it. I was excited as I had never seen anything like this before. As everyone was looking (7-10 people) it happend once again and in a different direction. Most of the people there saw it that time. Even other campers cam by and asked if we saw it. My first UFO.... I hacve travel the world, ex military and a Government employee for over 25 years. I have never seen anything like this and probably never will again.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Bright orange lights appearing and disappearing over the ocean;2003-09-09 22:00:00;15 minutes;Bright orange lights appearing and disappearing over the ocean My sister, my friend and myself were sitting on the beach enjoying the almost full moon over the ocean.  I looked up and saw what I thought was Mars.  I pointed it out to the others and thought nothing of it.  Then it disappered.  I figured it just went behind a cloud.  A few minutes later we saw it reappear in a different location.  That was when I noticed that Mars had been just off to the lower right of the moon.  Sure enough, this object faded out just as the first one had.  A few  minutes again, and it shows up in another location.  This happened for about fifteen minutes and then just seemed to stop.  At one point two of the lights showed up right next to each other and again faded.  We all know we saw something that was witnessed by a lot of people based on the other reports from the same area and time.

LARGE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT DISAPEARS AFTER SPLITTING 2 RED LIGHTS  TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT IN THE SKY!;2003-09-27 22:00:00;On & OFF 3 HRS.;LARGE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT DISAPEARS AFTER SPLITING 2 RED LIGHTS  TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT IN THE SKY! HUGE LIGHTS OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN SPLIT APART! I was standing down near the ocean in Myrtle Beach,South Carolina with some friends and we saw a large light in the sky. A large white light turned red and split apart into 2 red lights in the sky. The red lights would stay there for about a minute and they would disapear. The same thing happen again down the beach, big white light went out while smaller red lights shoot out, the large white light disapeared again! We saw jets (military) Aircraft coming from the area of Shaw Air Force Base out of Sumter,S.C. go out to the location of where the lights were, as though they were searching for what I had seen in the sky. This has happen several times a week in the sky and almost the same spot. The jets would fly out circling and I'm sure they was sent out for that purpose. The jets had weapons on them as if they were on a misson! I have seen these lights off and on the whole month of September. I saw the UFO's over the ocean and the jets landed at Myrtle Beach airport, every time the jets showed up the lights never appeared! The Jets stayed at the Myrtle Beach Airport 4 days and no lights! It was like the (UFO's) knew when the jets were around because they never showed back up until the jets left.  I surf fish almost every night in September and October (The fall months) because the fishing is the best, These nights were clear and I could tell what was stars and what was not. These things (UFO's)that I saw was not Stars!..not any that I've ever saw! I have seen serveral UFO's over the past 15 years, There was a write up in the Myrtle Beach News Paper about these lights and a lot of people reported seeing them, I will try and get the news paper about the reports of sightings. There are UFO's in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Thank You, Ed ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Series of lights, lighting in sequence from right to left, and fading out in same sequence.;2003-12-03 22:35:00;20-30seconds;Series of lights, lighting in sequence from right to left, and fading out in same sequence. At 22:35 I observed the following from a hotel balcony overlooking the ocean: A series of lights fading in in sequence, each light staying lit for about 3-4 seconds before fading out. The lights began to the right and lit up one after the other from right to left. First 5 or 6 in straight line, the remainder at various heights but close in proximity of height (estimate 500 to 1000 feet above the ocean and 1-3 miles from the shoreline) Only 3-4 lights could be seen lit at any one time. The lights were orange-yellow in color and appeared to be shining directly at the shore as each one faded in and out. While lit, the lights could be seen hovering slightly upward and to the right very slowly, as if almost floating. Night was partly cloudy, and the lights were definitely below the cloudline as the lights were very clear and large.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Bright orange light lasts 3-5 seconds over ocean, accompanied by multiple strobe lights;2003-12-08 21:30:00;30 minutes;Bright orange light lasts 3-5 seconds over ocean, accompanied by multiple strobe lights Have seen this phenomena several times over the last couple of months, and did a web search to see if anyone else has seen it, hence this report. I live in an oceanfront condo, and was sitting on my balcony overlooking the ocean when a bright orange light appeared approximately 25 degrees off the horizon over the ocean. The light was bright enough to reflect in the water, although how far away it was I could not discern. The light basically blinked on, remained bright for about 3-5 seconds, and then quickly faded out. It did not move. Another light appeared about 5 minutes later at about the same height, but a quarter of the horizon north. Another appeared 10 minutes later, directly in front of me, at the same level, and as soon as it faded out, another one appeared maybe 5 degrees away from the first. The light is large, to my eye approximately 10 times larger than Mars. Focusing binoculars on the light does not provide any discernible object, with no running lights visible after it fades to indicate an aircraft. There was a full moon out, which backlit the sky enough to make any physical object visible through binoculars. The sky was clear. Each time I have seen these orange lights, they are accompanied by a multitude of white strobes, numbering anywhere between 10-30, which move across the sky at various altitudes, but the movement is erratic. I am used to seeing aircraft strobes as planes departing and landing from the Myrtle Beach airport fly across the ocean regularly. These strobes do not track like an aircraft, but erratically bounce around. At times a red strobe can be seen alongside the white strobes. Mostly the strobes can only be seen with binoculars, however it is not uncommon to discern them with the naked eye once you know what to look for. I have always seen these objects between 9pm and 11pm, sometimes they last for two hours, other times for a half hour. Tonight I observed a set of 6 white strobes move inland for the first time. They normally remain offshore. The strobe! s are very small, which makes judging their distance difficult. The strobes and orange lights sometimes appear on one side of the horizon, then the orange light will appear on the opposite side, and the strobes appear to race across the sky to it. A multitude of aircraft with strobes moving as a group may appear they are moving erratically due to the nature of a strobe light. The only explaination I can devise concerning the orange lights is possibly the glow from afterburners, although there is no aircraft visible when it fades, ie no running lights. Two guests have seen these lights on different nights with me.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

They were very bright white lights, 4 lights vertical and 1 over to the side.  I saw them for a few seconds and then they moved away and I could not see them.  About 2 minutes later I saw the same thing and it caught the attention of 2 other people.  It was very silent and we heard nothing.

I was driving down 31 towards 501 and I spotted the first two. One was higher up than the other, about as high up as the smaller planes fly in the area, but they couldnt have been planes because they dissappeared. These big orange lights sat in the sky motionless for a moment before vanishing. I don't know how long that had been there before I saw them. I turned off of 31 to 501 and saw the other one. Same as the other two, big orange light sitting in the sky then vanished. I watch the sky all the time and I have never seen anything like this.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

As soon as we herd the blast we rushed to check the kids then we herd the jets screaming accross the sky. We ran out side as well as some neighbors .I have not herd a sonic blast since I live at Edwards AFB in California. My wife pointed out 3 lights in a straight line that just seemed to faid out as fast as they appeared it freaked us out and I blew it off as just some military practice. The local news is not very helpfull and are just as confused as myself. I have herd and seen these befor in california with the excepion of the strange lights, and sounds. To me the fighter jets sounded more like they were chasing something, not just practice. I have herd a report of an Air Raid siren going off in NC just befor the sonic blast. This come from someone in Surfside beach who was on the phone with a friend in NC at the time and herd it all. I have also watched a report on the news and one persons experiance was close to ours and she discribed the lights as flairs. Well I live around the military long enough this was not normal. Then I was searching the internet and found somewere on this site someone in Goergetown saw lights but no sound.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

At first I didn't really notice it because it blended in with the sky and looked like a distant star or planet. The light trail retracted as quickly as the acceleration, in a delayed reaction from lft to rght.  It traveled horizontaly from left to right in the southwestern sky. I tried to play it off as a shooting star, but I'm not sure if shooting stars fly horizontally. ((NUFORC Note:  No date provided by the witness.

Bright Orange Stationary Lights;2005-11-07 18:45:00;minutes;Bright Orange Stationary Lights It was about a quarter till 7 in the evening and it was  pretty much dark.  I took my dog out to use the bathroom.  While waiting on him, a light caught my eye.  My first thought was it was a Bright star we have seen in the sky for months now that twinkles.  As I looked at it my thought changed.  We live in a flight path of our air port and often on hazy nights when planes come in their lights look orange.  Having a love for aviation I always watch planes flying by.  As I was watching the stationary bright orange light that appeared low in the horizon, suddenly a second light light up just adjacent to the first as it went out, then a third light further away light up and the second one went out.  Each lasting about 2-3 seconds.  All of the lights seemed to be in a horizontal plane.  As I could not believe what i just saw, I stood there watching the sky.  About 3-4 minutes later watching the same area the sky lit upwith about 6-7 more of these bright orange lights all seemed to be in the same horizontal plane all lasting 2-3 seconds.  None of the lights lit up at the same time but some were overlapping( one was going out as another was lighting up). after the last one went out I did not see any more.  As the last one went out my dog that was now inside started barking. I went inside and my wife had called me just as the last one went out and he was barking at the phone.   I dont know what I saw, I have never seen a UFO before but this was very weird.  The area where they lit up was over wet land and a portion of state route 31 not where there are any people.  The sky was not 100% dark and I could not make out any shape behind them and the lights did not move and they all looked alike and they made no sound and no low flying aircrafts around. there were planes at like the 30000 feet flying way above this area.  What ever it was I freaked me out a bit and made me wonder what I saw.  I just thought I would share what i saw with everyone else in case anyone else saw it too.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
1-2-3-4-Red/Orange orbs out at sea blink on for 30 seconds then gone. very strange;2006-05-19 22:00:00;3 - 8 min.;1-2-3-4-Red/Orange orbs out at sea blink on for 30 seconds then gone. very strange Every yr for bike week Myrtle beach S.C. we rent the same house on the beach, It was around 10-11pm several of us watched a lightning storm for a good half hr or better after it died down,  I (alone) looked out at sea from a upper deck of the house, when i noticed a red/orange light ball , it was to high off the ocean to belong to a ship and to low,fast, steady to be a aircraft. The moment i noticed it, it was bright for a 5 second count standing still, then suddenly shot left about 5 ft.,stopped, then it was gone(light went out) Several friends where standing behind me, but not paying attention to what i just seen, so i said Hey, anyone just see that? they all joked and broke my stones, then about 4 friends and myself where looking for what i just descibed, when suddenly 1-red/orange light popped on, then the 2nd light, 3rd, and 4th, they all where in line same height off the sea, same distance from eachother, they stayed on for about 30 seconds then they went off in the same order they came on 1-2-3-4. We waited to see if there was any more activity for approx. 15-20 minutes with nothing more. Then the discussion started, I was in the Marine Corps and I immediatly said too high to be a ship/boat, forget flares of any type, and forget after burner, 3 out of my 4 friends all admitted never have seen this ever and no one offered a logical solution to this event, we believe we saw something that is not normal maritime behavior or normal airline/flight behavior;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Amber lights over Myrtle Beach South Carolina;2006-07-26 19:00:00;2 hours;Amber lights over Myrtle Beach South Carolina On the evening of the 26th of july 2006 my family and I saw something we could not explain. We were on the balcony of our hotel facing the ocean and saw 3 amber colored lights hovering out in front of us probably a few miles out.  At first we thought it was the lights of a plane that was flying directly at us.   This obviously was not the case when the light on the right split into 2 lights. This was not a flare either because the lights were not falling, they were stationary.  This got my attention! I knew then that this was not our technology.  After a few minutes passed the lights just disappeared.   At this point we all were just in astonishment that we just witnessed this.  A few minutes later the 4 lights reappeared in a different location on the horizion. It seemed like they traveled miles and miles in only a minute.  The lights disappeared and reappeared again in a different location.  This happened 4 or 5 more times in the next 60 minutes or so. During this t! ime the sun had set and it was dark outside.  My cousin and I went down to the ocean and we sit on the sand and just watched.  As I looked up at the stars I saw around 20 white lights in some kind of formation traveling together and leaving together.  That is what happened to us so I thought I would share that.  That day changed my whole perspective on this ufo phenomenon.   Thanks for letting me share.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

My wife and I spotted lights over the Atlantic while sitting on the 19th floor of a highrise. They appeared about 8-10 times over the period of the hour we sat out. The glowing lights were about 1/3 the size of a moon, but possible haze could have magnified them. They would appear for 3-7 secs. , then dissappear. At times three were in a line while another was on the horizon. Most of the sightings were about at 40 degrees. I asked other hotel guests and even asked a policeman, but no one heard anything or witnessed them.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
White ball of light over ocean east of Myrtle Beach, then planes to investigate;2007-02-22 23:30:00;25 - 30 sec.;White ball of light over ocean east of Myrtle Beach, then planes to investigate I saw something that was definitely not an airplane, or a seagull, or refracted light from Venus through swamp gas, right after the Slayer show behind the House of Blues, Myrtle Beach (2/22/07). I was perfectly sober though a little tired from the show, so I was sitting on the curb behind the HOB waiting for autographs in a crowd of about 30 people and was facing due E. At the risk of sounding like a fool to these strangers and losing sight of it in the sky by trying to share it, I chose not to draw attention to what I saw. I wish I would have thought to take the camera in my pocket out and snap a few shots, but I was in a state of shock.  It was just a hazy light ball and it was definitely airborne because along the back of the HOB is a fence that is at least a little bit taller than I am, but it is also 20-30 ft. away from the curb I was sitting on. Perspective-wise it was a good couple of feet above the fence. Behind the fence and off to the right, (the direction it was traveling), was a light pole some distance away with a light gleaming away in my face, and hotels in the distance along with shrubbery and branches along the back of the fence. It was a windy night, pretty clear and it was sometime between 11:30 and 12:00 AM. I was sitting on the curb smoking a cigarette and chillin' facing about E, away from the HOB towards the ocean and checking out the stars. I saw the typical air traffic and seagulls enjoying the windy night.  It was a small, faint and hazy white light and at first I thought, That jet is hauling a$$!!  I’ve never seen a jet moving that fast, then it struck me how much like a star it resembled. Because it was just a ball of light it was hard to judge it's size and distance, however if the planes that appeared after I saw it presumably went to the general area it was at, and my own judgement of perspective wasn’t too far off, it was definitely waaay out over the ocean. I checked it out on Google Earth from the direction I was facing the shore was roughly .7 of a mile away, these planes and my own judgement of perspective put it AT LEAST a mile or more away.  It's path, from when I first noticed it started out parallel to the earth and traveled like this for maybe 5 seconds. Then almost a 90 degree turn at what seemed to be straight up, then another sharp degree of turn up and away at an angle, then another turn at a downward angle, and yet another at a down and backwards angle, then once it reached about where it's original path was, it resumed. Half of these turns were in a span of maybe 1-2 seconds, but no more than 3 at the absolute most and the other two were really short. Once it resumed it's original path it faded out after about 3 seconds. Like a lightbulb slowly going out, then instantly it began glowing again, so quickly I never lost track of it. From my perspective it was headed into the gleaming light, but it faded out for about a second, if only for a second and then came back to full glow before it passed behind the light pole and remained glowing, so I never lost it through the light. Now, on the other side of the light pole and after about another 2-4 seconds it faded out again for the second time and that's when I never saw it again.  I kept watching for it, but it never reappeared. It's path was straight, and looked very deliberate, not like it was a trashbag blowing in the wind or another seagull or something. The three things that have me pretty much convinced what I saw is some sort of a UFO is the blazing speed, the ease of the change of direction without even slowing down and that it was traveling in straight lines, not circling or twirling as if something caught in the wind. It was like someone was holding one of those laser pointers in the sky only it was faint and white.  I was glued to the sky, but saw no more. About 5-7 minutes later I saw two planes coming from the N along the coastline or there abouts and heading that direction, about the time they got where it was, I noticed another plane that must've come from the SW or that general direction. The two planes from the N went further S and I almost lost them behind the hotels and stuff on the horizon and then returned, while the other plane continued N for a few minutes and returned. I wasn’t sure what I was seeing, so I just stared in disbelief. I thought about telling some of my friends, but decided not to get picked on that night.  I documented this the next morning and waited to see if someone else reported this, but I’ve not seen anything yet.  I am a believer and was before this incident, but still remain skeptical as to what I saw.  If you also saw this, I urge you to report it. I also am attaching various files that may explain this in greater detail.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Large Orange Lights Appear in Formations;2007-06-26 22:30:00;30 Seconds & Over 1 hour;Large Orange Lights Appear in Formations Myrtle beach, S.C. 06/26 & 6/28  On the first night my fiancé and I were sitting on our ocean front hotel balcony eight stories up.  The moon was almost full and the sky was mostly clear during the sighting and turned cloudy shortly after.  It was around 10:30 p.m.  We were admiring the night sky when we saw 5 orange lights appear one by one.  They were huge lights, bigger than any passing planes and much larger than the biggest stars.  They lit up one at a time with out any trails around them and without moving.  They lit up from left to right in an upwards facing bow pattern one by one.  Once all five were lit they turned off one by one in the reverse direction.  The lights were well above the horizon and appeared to the left of the moon.  The formation was huge in length and at least twice the size of the moon in the night sky.  The whole thing lasted only a few seconds.  The moon was very bright and we could tell that there was no visible shape behind the lights.  We then watched the sky for around 15 minutes to look for anything else without luck.  After this we rushed down to the beach to see if we could walk around and see if anyone else was talking about the lights.  As we got out to the beach a low flying fighter jet rushed to the north along the shoreline. 	The next night, 6/27, we watched briefly for the lights but saw nothing.  On 6/28, we decided to sit out on the balcony at 10 p.m.  The moon, even fuller than the preceding nights, illuminated a partly cloudy sky.  At 10:08 p.m., as we were gazing out at the ocean,  the same large orange lights appeared in the sky, this time there were 4 and they were in a ‘/’ diagonal shape.  Again, the moon was very bright and we could tell that there was no viable shape behind the lights. So, upon seeing them again, we called for my fiancé’s brother and his mother to come outside onto the balcony with us.  We waited, looking at the sky, hoping to show them the lights.  Over the next 30 minutes or so they showed up again a few times, but only one or two at a time.  Their locations varied each time they appeared.  Then they appeared directly in front of us.  There were 4 and they were in a ‘-_-_’ staggered pattern.  Immediately after they turned off, they same formation appeared again slightly above and to the left of the first.  Then after a few minutes had passed, another formation appeared.  This one was three lights in a ‘/’ diagonal pattern.  It looked slightly further away than the first but it was still significantly bigger than any planes or stars.  A few more minutes passed and we saw what looked like a plane or fighter jet heading in the same northwards direction towards where the lights had been. 	 I am in college and my fiancé and I are science buffs in our free time.  We are very skeptical people and always look for logical explanations to every situation.  This was totally beyond our explanation.  There was NOTHING visible behind the lights.  Each time they appeared in plain view in the light of the moon.  There were no trails like with a meteorite and the lights were not moving.  They did not dim, they simply went out. They were much bigger than any known man made aircraft.  The lights left all 4 of us utterly speechless.  We did look again at the same time on 6/29 but we saw nothing out of the ordinary.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Red/orange lights over ocean appearing, moving horizontally, then disappearing;2007-06-28 23:00:00;5-10 seconds each occurre;Red/orange lights over ocean appearing, moving horizontally, then disappearing While on vacation, my wife and I both saw unidentified red and orange lights over the Atlantic Ocean from the beach and the balcony of our hotel room in Myrtle Beach, S.C.  We observed these lights June 24, 26, 27 and 28, 2007, between the hours of 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. (the one night exception we were not outside at night).  The lights didn't appear in precisely the same spot, but were always about the same height (roughly 30-40 degrees above the horizon). They were red (more so earlier in the week) to a reddish-orange (more so later in the week). I would estimate the size to be larger and brighter than Mars they were large enough that they had appeared to have a round shape to them, but weren't orbs, per se.  The lights appeared in different numbers there was always at least two, and at least once there was five. The lights would come into view, sometimes one at a time, sometimes almost simultaneously, and move on a horizontal plane (maybe with a very slight downward arc) either in the same direction or in opposite directions before fading out nearly simultaneously after 5-10 seconds. Generally, the lights would appear one at a time or almost in pairs, and move apart from the center, although it wasn't always symmetrical, and they didn't always disappear at the same instant.  The lights appeared often in the same general location, but they would also appear at different spots. Once, the lights appeared in their “usual location,” then reappeared no more than two minutes later quite a distance away (20-30 degrees). We saw the lights more than once each night, probably as many as 5-6 times.  The particular nights we saw these lights, the moon was working its way toward full and there were few clouds, so the sky was quite bright, making it more interesting that these lights showed up so brightly. It was impossible to judge their distance, but it felt like they were distant the fact that the moon was bright would mean these lights would have to be fairly bright to get through the light pollution.  Seeing as how were at the ocean and in a hotel with dozens of humming air conditioners, there was no sound connected to the sightings.  Our hotel was beachfront, located on Ocean Boulevard more or less across from 27th Avenue South. We also saw the lights as we walked along the beach, and once heard someone near us say something to the effect of “Look at the airplane!”  As for possible explanations of the lights, they were certainly not airplanes. The airport was near our hotel, and we observed a number of planes taking off. But the lights appeared and disappeared randomly, and moved in different directions. We thought they could be signal flares, and since I'm not a nautical type, I'm not sure how such a thing works. However, I would expect signal flares to move up, not slowly horizontally, and not in different directions. Also, I don't know far away you could see signal flares. The color and intensity of the lights would remind you of fireworks viewed at fairly close range, but they didn't wink out quite like fireworks, instead seeming to fade from view. Additionally, they didn't “twinkle” the way a star does instead, they were steady while they lasted.  As for other incidental notes, there were a number of military fighter jets taking off from the nearby airport each day, but these always took off during the daytime and usually turned inland, so I don't think they were addressing the lights in any way.  As for background, I am an editor/graphics person and my wife a high school teacher. I've never claimed to have seen a UFO, but I was indeed a big fan of the X-Files, so you can make of that what you want.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

UFO in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina;2007-09-04 20:30:00;10 seconds;UFO in Myrtle Beach South Carolina I am a commercial pilot with over 6000 flight hours.  I was walking on the beach approximately 1 mile north of the apache pier when I witnessed lights turning on, then off in sequence.  My girlfriend saw them too.  Approximately 15 minutes later, my girlfriend, my son, and her two sons witnessed the lights again. They illuminated and then extinguished within 10 seconds.  The lights illuminated 3 at a time. They were red with circular shapes around them.  The craft was approximately 5 miles away, and I estimate it to be 500+ feet long.  From my experience piloting over 60 different aircraft, this was not a vehicle created on Earth by our species.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Observed red lights over the ocean that appeared and then faded out.;2007-10-15 21:30:00;30 minutes;Observed red lights over the ocean that appeared and then faded out. We observed several lights in the sky over the ocean just offshore of Myrtle Beach, SC.  The red lights seemed to appear in the sky glowed brightly and then faded out.  The did not move. We could not tell how far away or how high they were because it was dark and the sky was a little overcast. We saw one light and then another appeared to its right.  Once these faded out there was another that appeared to the right and higher in the sky.  This light remained bright and then another appeared in front of it and to the left and then another as though there was a progression of them.  All the lights were red. This was on October 15, 2007 at about 9:30 EST. We called the coast guard and reported it since we didn’t know if this could have been a boat sending up distress flares.  While we were talking to them someone else called to report the lights. The person at the coast guard took the information and said that they thought it was something that the air force was doing.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Bright lights over the ocean in Myrtle Beach, SC... 3 of them forming a diagonal line.;2007-10-18 21:45:00;5 -7 minutes;Bright lights over the ocean in Myrtle Beach, SC... 3 of them forming a diagonal line. My husband (a supervisor for a finance company) and I (a stay-at-home wife and former telephone operator for 15 years) were vacationing in Myrtle Beach, SC in October.  We stayed at an oceanfront hotel and the first evening we arrived, we went downstairs to take some pictures of the indoor lazy river and the outdoor pool area of the hotel.  We noticed a very bright white light with a little red in it, in the sky over the ocean.  Thinking it was a plane at first, we still continued to watch it because it was so bright!  It was moving very slowly to the left (north).  After about a minute or two, another light shot out of the bright one (to it’s left) and then 2 other lights lit up in a straight diagonal line with the one that had shot out.  They lit in sequence at evenly spaced intervals of time (about 2 seconds apart).  They were bright white also with a little red in them, but were smaller in size than the initial one.  The initial bright light and the 3 other smaller lights all moved very slowly to the north in the same formation (still over the ocean).  The initial bright one went out after a couple of minutes and the smaller 3 lights went out about a minute later, one at a time and at evenly spaced intervals of time.  Then just a few seconds later, we could see 2 very small white lights traveling at a very fast rate of speed much higher up in the sky.  One was slightly below and behind the other.  They were also traveling northward.  We did see a plane in another section of the sky, and observed that these smaller white lights were moving so much faster than the plane!  We have no idea what any of these lights were, but we were certainly fascinated by them.  Dumbstruck might be more like it.  I had a camera in my hand and didn’t think about taking a picture until after the first bright light had already gone out.  I tried to take a picture of the other 3 lights that formed the diagonal line, I used the 12x zoom, but I had just gotten this digital camera and am still learning how to use all the different settings, so the picture came out very grainy.  The lights also look rather orange in the picture, but in person they were white with a bit of red.  Just to note: the other pictures I took outside that night (before we saw any of the objects) didn’t come out as grainy as the picture of the objects.  We would love to have an explanation of what these lights were.  My husband and I are pretty skeptical people when it comes to UFO’s, aliens and the like, but this experience is certainly one that we will remember for the rest of our lives.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Multiple unexplained lights;2009-10-08 21:30:00;1 minute day, 2-3 minutes;Multiple unexplained lights On the day's of October 7th and 8th, my sister, mother, and myself were vacationing at Myrtle Beach, SC.   At approximately 21:30 my sister and myself were on our balcony of our hotel room.  When suddenly a bright light appeared out of nowhere.  Then a second light flashed on beside the first. Then a third flashed on, followed by a fourth.  These lights looked like no more than 40 feet from shore distance wise, the height of which they were at was probably no more than 700 feet at the highest.   My first thought was they had to be flares, but they would flash on and off and never descended from their altitude. They stayed for approximately 2 minutes or so the first night.  The second night at about the same time approximately the same light appeared this time much farther out.  This was followed by the same flashing on and off pattern from the night before.  After a minute or so they faded out, only to reappear much closer...one at a time.  The same flashing fo! rmation continued for approximately 35 seconds or so.  At this point they disappeared again, only to reappear at a third sight much farther out but parallel to their original point approximately 1400 to 2000 feet off shore.  The height remained about constant from both days.  This time though, my sister, my mom and I all witnessed the lights.   I have done some research on these Myrtle Beach lights, and have seen some video.  The video's I have seen are the exact same lights me and my family witnessed.

Disc-like object emitting a cluster of lights spotted over Myrtle Beach, SC.;2009-10-10 05:00:00;~2 minutes;Disc-like object emitting a cluster of lights spotted over Myrtle Beach, SC. Around 5:00AM on October 10, 2009, I was sitting on a balcony of the South Beach Resort (XXXX ((numbers deleted)) S Ocean Blvd) in Myrtle Beach, facing the ocean.  A light appeared over the horizon just above the surface of the water, and as it grew closer, I could see that it was a cluster of four large lights, hovering silently toward the land. Over the span of just a minute or two, it hovered from the water toward the hotel, ascending steadily at a 45 degree angle to the ground until it was out of sight.  When I took a photo on my phone, the lights were not visible, and the object's shape was disc like.  I will send the photo via email. At the time, I was a seventeen-year-old high school student and never would have thought to report it. No one else that I know of witnessed the event.  I'm currently a graduate student studying early American roots music, and cryptozoology is nothing to which I have ever given much thought. However, I recently saw a special which described the 1967 sighting at Shag Harbor, Nova Scotia, and the event sounded so eerily similar that I thought my sighting might warrant sharing with an expert.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

It could have been birds, but the lights never broke formation.  It moved at a constant speed (fast).  My fiance saw the object, or objects, first for about 5 seconds and then by the time her brain processed and she told me to look it was about 3 seconds, so I only saw it for about 2 seconds, but that was enough.

Yellow lights in changing formations off coast of Myrtle Beach;2011-03-29 20:00:00;5 Minutes;Yellow lights in changing formations off coast of Myrtle Beach Incident at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on Tuesday, March 29, 2011. This incident happened around 8:00 P.M. on the beach located at 5200 North Ocean Blvd. and was witnessed by my wife and I, my daughter and her husband and their two children.  We were walking on the beach to the north and it was dark.  Looking out over the ocean to the east I noticed a bright yellow colored light moving parallel to the beach toward the north.  The light slowed to a stop and went out.  I had shouted for the others to look at the light and they also were able to see it going out.  The next we saw was a single yellow light appear and it was stationary. A second light appeared south of it and then another and another.  A total of four lights were in a row and all stationary.  Then a fifth light came on further south of it.  The lights then went out in sequence and reappeared in sequence twice more.  My daughter said it appeared to her to be rotating.  This all took approximately 30 seconds.  The lights then disappeared.  We stood watching that area of the sky fo! r another minute or more when we then saw another yellow light appear further north and travel toward the south.  Two more lights then came on toward the south and one of them moved north until it appeared to joining with the other light coming south.  The lights went out again.  We stood there for another several minutes and saw two more yellow lights appear in the same area and then go out.  Each time the lights did not appear to flicker or loose altitude due to falling or drifting.  It was also pretty windy that evening. My son-in-law was able to capture the second set of lights on his camera video.  We watched for quite awhile after this however we did not see the lights again.  Upon doing a search in my computer I learned that there had been other numerous sightings of these lights by others in the Myrtle Beach area.  One of these posts is where I found your website address. My wife and I and our daughter and son-in-law are all professionals and none of us has ever witnessed anything like this before.

Two orange lights were spotted near the heart of Myrtle Beach, SC.;2011-11-01 17:20:00;2 minutes;Two orange lights were spotted near the heart of Myrtle Beach, SC. I was driving beachbound down US 501 on my way to the gym when I happened to look to my left.  I noticed a small, orange light appear in the sky.   After a second or two, another orange light appeared just above it and a bit to the right, forming a small diagonal.   Just as quickly as they had appeared, the first light went off followed by the second.  As they disappeared, they seemed to shudder off into the dark. This was the third sighting I've had in the Myrtle Beach area and the second in the last 2 years.  Every sighting has been the same in color and shape, from what I can tell.  My very first sighting was in September of 2003 and was too close for comfort.  After seeing orb-like orange lights along the coast and then in the Carolina Forest area, I experienced what appeared to be two extremely bright white lights (I've described them as looking like the headlights on a car) hovering silently just above a two-story house, over the driveway.  There were six witnesses that night, but only three of us believed what we saw was a UFO.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

5 Bright yellow/orange lights flash then fade in sequence over ocean at dusk in Myrtle Beach;2012-04-17 20:10:00;15 Seconds;5 Bright yellow/orange lights flash then fade in sequence over ocean at dusk in Myrtle Beach I was sitting on the boardwalk in the center of Myrtle Beach,looking at the ocean at dusk.  First couple of stars in the sky were barely visible.  Planes and boats were still plainly visible.  All of a sudden relatively large golden/orange ball appeared and glowed brightly for approx. 1-2 seconds then faded quickly.  A 2nd appeared and faded in the exact same fashion right beside the first.  A third and then 4 appeared/faded in the exact same fashion.  All appeared in an exactly straight line.  5 appeared, glowed and faded directly below the line of the other 4.  All appeared and faded sequentially.  When the first faded, the second appeared 1-2 seconds later. when 2nd faded the 3rd appeared and so on.  Entire incindent lasted approx. 10-15 seconds.  As I explained planes and other objects were still plainly visible as it was dusk.  There were not other objects associated with these lights.  Although it was fairly clear with no cloud reference, they appeared to be a few miles away and quite large.  The lights were significantly larger and significantly brighter than the planes arriving and departing the airport a few miles to the south.  The glow was similar to a firey color/fashion - what I imagine a fighter jet engine flare would look like if you were looking directly into its tail.  As if a jet went full throttle and then quickly throttled back.  Only much larger.  It almost appeared to burn and disappear like a flare only each light was perfectly stationary.  When it was over I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it and there was only an asian couple - like any ignorant American, I naturally assumed wouldn't speak english and didn't talk to them :) I asked several couples that walked by if they'd seen it but no one else seemed to have been looking.  I kept watching the sky for 15 min but saw nothing else.  Either way feel very lucky to have witnessed something so spectacular.  From a cursory search of Google, I'm one of several dozen folks who have seen such a thing a Myrtle Beach over the last 5 years.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Orange glowing lights then fading out several times in eastern sky;2012-06-14 21:00:00;10 - 15 minutes;Orange glowing lights then fading out several times in eastern sky This relates to the same event that occurred back on 04/17/12 in Myrtle Beach, Sc. So on this evening my wife and I was sitting in our drive way enjoying the nice evening when close to 9pm we noticed to the eastern sky a bright light glowing orange in color such as a fireball, glowing bright then fading out. When it first appeared it was 1 then the  2nd one appeared and as soon as it appeared the first one faded out and soon after the 2nd one faded out both in about 10 - 15 seconds.  I asked my wife did she see that and she said yes, what was it? I stated I don't know. Then in about 3 minutes later in the south eastern sky it appeared again but this time it was 3 lights..  One and as soon as the second was lit then the third.  Then the first faded, then the second, then third.  Again, back to the eastern sky in about 5 minutes the two appeared the same way as previous and then fading back out.  Then about 5 minutes later back to the south eastern sky 4 appeared the same fashion as 3 and fading out just the same.  My son and stepson came out and seen the last 4 and are now wearing my wife and I out with questions and we have no answers so we turn to the web and see that several responses have been posted over the past few years in this area. Even though we live about 8 miles south from MYR airport and the 2 planes I seen was more towards north of the glowing lights.

The lights seemed 3-4 times bigger and brighter than the biggest and brightest star around.  What ever it was it definitely was not normal.  It was not a plane or helicopter or flare.

I see it off the coast of beach resort.  The only thing that it could be is a formation of fighter jets but I do not hear anything and they appeared to multiply as odd ad that is....  they are staying in the same location and a fellow whitness claimed to see it the night before at the same time.  Now I see them blinking like planes but in a group of around 2 to 4 some are hard to see.  All I know is that these were not commercial aircraft;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

At first it was one red/orange light that would go out, move far away, and come back on.  Then it was 3 lights, then it became 6 lights. They stayed in lines of 3 together.   This occurred at approximately 6:30 PM on October 23, 2012.  It only lasted about 10 minutes.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Bright orange lights appeared above the horizon, only to disappear, then reappear in formation.  Lasted about 30 seconds.;2012-10-24 20:30:00;30 seconds;Bright orange lights appeared above the horizon, only to disappear, then reappear in formation.  Lasted about 30 seconds. A bright orange light appeared just above the horizon (12 o'clock position), facing east, towards the ocean from Highway 17 Business in Restaurant Row.  It disappeared.   No sooner than it disappeared, another bright orange light appeared (2 o'clock position).  If this was a plane, there was no way it could have traveled across the sky to reach this new location in that short of a time span.  The 2nd orange light disappeared.   Within a few seconds another bright orange light appeared above the last position. I had to look up to see this third bright orange light.  No way for a helicopter or a plane to make such a vertical ascent in only a few short seconds.  This third light also vanished.   At this time all 3 witnesses (myself and 2 co-workers) are watching this unfold.  After the third light vanished, in roughly the same position, 4 bright orange lights appeared in a perfectly straight horizontal line, side by side.  This lasted only a couple of seconds unti! l they slowly faded out, one at a time, from left to right.   We cannot explain this.  As far as all 3 witnesses are concerned, this was not any type of plane, helicopter, hot air balloon, or aerial vessel that we have ever seen.  There was no sound, nor did they move in any direction once the lights appeared.   They simply appeared and then vanished, only to reappear in different spots, and then as a whole formation at the end.  This entire process lasted about 30 seconds.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
A bright light moving across the sky, then it changed direction.;2012-10-30 23:00:00;~1 second;A bright light moving across the sky, then it changed direction. I was taking my 2 dogs out for their evening bathroom break and it was around 11 at night on Oct 30, 2012.    While I watched my dogs do their thing I caught a bright small white light out of the corner of my eye.  It was moving across the sky north of my house and was moving from East to West.  It was moving so fast that it traversed the sky in less than a second.   As it was approaching the West side of the horizon, it turned its trajectory away from the ground and disappeared  from view.  It was totally silent and appeared to be fairly high up.   I did see something similar to this sighting a couple of years ago, but didn’t report it.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
2 yellow-orange star-like objects.;2012-12-05 20:30:00;3 minutes;2 yellow-orange star-like objects My husband, young daughter, and I were traveling to Myrtle Beach for a few days and were about 15 minutes away from our resort traveling on 544 W when I noticed a bright, yellowish-orange light that was star-like, but noticeably larger.  At first, I thought it might be a cell tower light because it was stationary and it faded out, but less than a minute later, it appeared again in a different location with another one beside it.  They both remained stationary and faded out.   About a minute later, they appeared again closer together for only 2 or 3 seconds and faded out a final time.  It was cloudy and foggy the rest of our evenings in Myrtle Beach.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Approximately 19:30   Driving southbound on Hwy 501 from Conway, SC to Myrtle Beach, SC while crossing the Lake Busbee bridge, my partner and I saw several red lights grouped together in the north east part of the sky.   The lights proceeded to separate and form triangles (obtuse and acute) moving south.  There were three lights per triangle.  The movements were very rapid and linear.  The movement was so fast that the shapes just appeared.  There were several triangles formed. My partner and I pulled over to observe the phenomenon.  The lights started to disappear.  South of us, two orange lights remained.  Then one disappeared and only one was left.  It dropped down below the trees, and then it slowly rose in the sky.   From the distance similar to that of a star, it transformed to a blurry white/silver spot.  The blur started to drop closer until it was close enough to recognize as a triangle with rounded edges.  It was spinning very fast, which created some type of waves in the air around it.   When it got to the height slightly lower than a hovering helicopter, it transformed into a bubble/balloon with some type of ventilator on the side.  It was falling in a floating fashion similar to that of a plastic bag.   It floated over our heads and towards the woods before reaching Hwy 501 Business.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

At an altitude of 150 to 200 feet.. Approximated of course because I had nothing to reference it to.  The lights would  appear and disappear.  I had my phone in my hand waiting for call and I took a chance and took a photo of the lights.  I looked at it later and have been curious to what it is.

Looking toward the Eastern sky at approx 8:20 PM,   My wife, myself and my son watched 8 blinking objects fly from west to east at a fairly high rate of speed without any sound whatsoever.  Given the speed, at any altitude we should have been able to hear noise from either turbine or normally aspirated engines. NO SOUND!  Because the moon was full and so bright,  We would have been able to see a shape had the lights been one object. It is obvious that the lights were separate objects.   I am a pilot, (single engine, fixed wing) I know what airplanes and helicopters look like in the sky.  These were neither.

Airport is very near sighting.  There appeared to be one light from a second object following behind though low clouds may have obscured other lights. At first I thought a light then two then the third were stars but then noticed they were moving and not quite white like the other stars.  Then I thought it was a plane but first the plane was too high to be landing and it was a strange flight pattern coming directly west from the Atlantic ocean.  Then I noticed the lights jumping directly up and down a number of times.  I followed the lights over too long a distance for it to be a searchlight and the lights were distinct like distant stars or maybe aircraft lights.  It seemed strange and especially with the single light from another craft following close behind at the same low altitude. Conditions were not ideal because of the low clouds over the horizon.  The lights appeared visible to me intermittently through the clouds.  Don't know if they were satellites or even how far away they were but I was not looking high in the sky at all.  Wasn't super alarming but strange and no obvious explanation.  No one was nearby on the beach at night and no one with me.

Series of Yellow Lights Seen Over Myrtle Beach.;2014-10-21 21:14:00;3 minutes;Series of Yellow Lights Seen Over Myrtle Beach My son and I were sitting on the beach facing the ocean around 20:30.  Approximately 21:14, he asked if I saw the lights off to our right.  He described them as 3 yellow lights, well above the horizon in a single line.  They were spaced apart and didn't move.  According to him, they remained on for several seconds and disappeared.  As they were near the landing approach to the Myrtle Beach airport, I didn't think too much about it.  There were also some clouds in the night sky, so when I looked that direction I wasn't concerned that I did not see them. About 3-5 minutes later, a single yellow light appeared off to our left.  It was well off the coast and appeared to be 1000-2000 feet above the horizon based on airplanes seen during the day.  About 3 seconds after the first light appeared, a second light appeared to the left of the first one.  About 3 seconds later, a third light appeared to left of the second one.  Approximately 3 seconds later, a fourth light appeared to the left of the third one.  As the fourth light appeared, the first one faded out and disappeared.  As the fifth, sixth, and seventh lights appeared, this pattern continued.  Once the seventh light appeared, it remained lit until the sixth one went out.  Then the seventh faded out. We contined to look for another 30-45 minutes and did not see anything else out of the ordinary.  We did observe a couple of planes cross the sky from the left to right and land at the airport.  With landing lights on and marker lights, they resembled nothing like what we had seen.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Then after my sister exclaimed that was exactly what she saw, me my mother and cousin were silent in this incident, jokingly questioning our soberness, but as we got in the car discussing our somewhat insane experience we were traveling down hwy 501 south as we were about to go under the 31 overpass south we saw the orb again and then observed the pattern occur two more times before we went under ! the overpass once we came out the orbs were no more and the thing is last night the skies were relatively clear with few stratus clouds.

It was midway between the horizon and Orion. When I asked my wife to look at it we began to notice that it was moving.  The movement was pretty erratic.  Side to side and up and down.  Never moving very far in any direction and not moving particularly fast.  For long periods it remains stationary. At times it appeared to have a greenish color.

Orange Orbs appear and fade over ocean in Myrtle Beach;2016-04-21 20:50:00;10 seconds;Orange Orbs appear and fade over ocean in Myrtle Beach. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I was looking out over the Atlantic ocean, so East.  The orbs were high in the sky, if you were looking at the moon in the sky at the time they were southeast of that.  I would say at least a 40 degree angle from sea level. An orange orb light faded into view over the sky.  As it brightened, another orb brightened to the left of it, spaced out by about half the size of the moon in the sky.  When the other orb brightened the first orb faded systematically.  This happened several times for a total of 4 orbs that I observed.   When the last one faded, no other lights were visible in the sky. It was a clear night and no aircraft were noticeable.  The spacing of the lights would have made it inpossible to be a normal aircraft.  They were too far apart and they were stationary.  So while one was fading in one spot, one was brightening in another. Another friend saw at least two of them fade in and out.  Same thoughts, orange orbs that faded and brightened one after the other.  The whole time was only 5-10 seconds. Thank you for the quick response!  I have never seen anything like this before, and I am not sure if others may have see  this or may be able to explain this type of lighting in the sky.

It wasn’t even showing up on the app.  We figured it must have been a mistake and was about to stop looking until I saw a light appear out of nowhere.  Immediately, I told him I found it and showed him,  except this light was followed by 4 others!  All 5 lights moved in a line like pattern.  The app didn’t register anything in the sky when we pointed it in that direction.  The ISS flyovers take about 6 minutes to travel the distance these moved in 30-45 seconds!;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Our last night at the beach I was taking pictures of the moon over the ocean.  While taking photos I noticed something flash across the sky extremely fast starting from my left field of view to the right.  It literally flashed by less than a second.  When I checked my photos I found that I caught a pic of the object that I had seen flashing across the sky.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Orange orbs;2021-05-24 09:00:00;30 sec;Orange orbs It was 9 pm and my my whole family was sitting on the balcony at the resort. The sky was beautiful it was almost a full moon. I looked up and noticed two orange ( color of a fire)  orb lights, I said to my husband look! what is that?  When I told my husband to look a third orb appeared. The first two lights would have made a horizontal line if you were to draw a line connecting them. The third light was below the first two and off to the right slightly.  As soon as my husband looked and saw them the third light disappeared then the other two disappeared as well.  I said to the whole family that was a ufo! I can be very open minded to things like that and like to watch shows about ufos and Bigfoot sometimes when they are on. Im someone who likes to know a little bit about everything and can find a common interest with anyone. My husband is the total opposite! He thinks things like that are kind of crazy. He can come up with a logical explanation for anything. We both have college educations and make a good living.  The point of saying that is to let anyone know who reads this is . . . my husband even thought it was strange and was not trying to explain it away!;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

We looked out into the ocean and we saw three orange lights that were lit for 3 to 5 seconds and then dimmed out. One second later, the three lights appeared further down the beach going south.
