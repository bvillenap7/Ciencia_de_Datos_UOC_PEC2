A fire ball that stood over the ocean and came from the ocean!!!;2006-03-18 23:00:00;1 min;A fire ball that stood over the ocean and came from the ocean!!! It was a giant fire like ball floating in the sky. My mom and sister both saw it and thought it was the moon, but since hen is the moon firery red!?!? It just stood there for about 1 min, then it rose up above the clouds. It really scared me, but I'm used to seeing paranormal stuff, so I can't entirely explain the feeling. It also may have come from under the ocean because the day before the water stood still in one spot and glowed a bright orange clour coming from betheath the surface.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Bright white fireball with blue green and red tail shoots accross the sky during baseball game.;2007-07-27 21:00:00;1 second;Bright white fireball with blue green and red tail shoots accross the sky during baseball game. My family and I were at a baseball game and in about the 7th inning there was a bright white fireball with a blue, green, and red tail that shot across the sky right over the stadium. The Ball was traveling from east to west at lightning speed. There was no sound that I could hear and it just shot through the sky for a second then was gone. Everyone in the stadium that saw it gasped. I have never in my life had seen anything like it, the strangest thing was how close it seemed either that or it was huge and far away I don't know but it was the most bizarre night.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Large Orange Fireball Traveling Coastline in South Myrtle Beach July 17 20012;2012-07-17 02:00:00;3 minutes;Large Orange Fireball Traveling Coastline in South Myrtle Beach July 17 20012 We were in south Myrtle Beach, on the 10th floor balcony at a popular resort, on July 17th, at 2 AM, when we saw a large orange ball, coming from a southwest direction, traveling close to the shoreline. It was traveling in a straight line down the coastline. It looked like a fire- ball and was turning in different directions as it moved. It traveled down the coastline a good ways and then just disappeared. On the same balcony, on July 20th, around 1AM, we saw two similar balls of orange light, further out, over the ocean. They would appear for a few seconds and then disapper. This happened about 3 times that night. These lights were similar to a large orange ball of light we saw on a mountain in WV, about 40 years ago. We watched it most of the night and it just disappeared around 5am. The large one we saw at Myrtle Beach seemed to be turning in all directions, as it traveled along.  It looked like a huge ball of fire but didn't burn up.  Got on here when we returned home to see if others had seen it and were surprised to learn that they have been sighted there in past months.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

And it was way to fast for an air plain.  Then we got home went in and we herd the fighter jets circling around.   And like 2 min after we went back out we saw the same exact thing again one orange light then it went away then another orange light a good distance away.

Unidentified orange orbs flash and then synchronize over the ocean;2012-08-08 21:30:00;15 minutes;Unidentified orange orbs flash and then synchronize over the ocean While sitting on the beach waiting for the local fireworks show to start (there's one every Wednesday), my boyfriend and I noticed a bright orange/red ball of light directly east, out over the ocean, below cloud level. The first light appeared and disappeared, then another did the same.  Several minutes later, similar lights were seen doing the same. A few moments later, approximately 5 of these orbs synchronized and appeared in a slightly curved line and were equidistant from one another. They appeared for 5-10 seconds, then disappeared again, all at the exact same time. One more object appeared and disappeared afterward. The entire event occurred over the course of about 15 minutes. The orbs were roughly the color of a flare, but did not move as such.  Instead, they hovered and disappeared quickly, not slowly dying out like a flare would. Several aircraft left Myrtle Beach Airport around the time of the sighting, but when they flew near the orange orbs, they were much higher altitude. No sounds accompanied the sightings.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Strobe like flashes with orange fireballs in the shape of a triangle.;2012-09-10 23:00:00;1 hour;Strobe like flashes with orange fireballs in the shape of a triangle. Sitting on the balcony of our condo we saw a series of flashing lights.  They looked like chasing strobe lights forming a circle or even a cigar shape.  Then 3 fireballs formed one after the other creating a triangle.  We watched these flashing lights for almost an hour and in the distance where the ocean would meet the sky we saw 5 fireballs form in a straight line and then go out after about 10 seconds.   Then one fireball appeared by itself and then about 10 minutes later another appeared.  We followed the flashing lights with our eyes come from over the ocean inland.   They moved slowly but the flashes were strobe like.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
Fiery ball of light slowly growing bigger then fading away all in sequence in triangular formation with other lights.;2012-10-24 20:00:00;2-4 minutes;Fiery ball of light slowly growing bigger then fading away all in sequence in triangular formation with other lights. ll some of you will think I'm nuts but here it goes.....Monday night while I was standin on the balcony, of the room we are in, I seen a something slowly start to get bright like a perfect ball of fire then slowly fade away. then it moved what I figured was about a mile ,judging the distance it was from the shore line, and it lit up again. I just shrugged it off like it was some kind of coast gaurd training thing perhaps. Well lastnight I was in the same place same time roughly and I seen the lights again this time it was 2 to 4 lights on the south end of the water followed by 3 lights in the middle going tto the east and then 4 to 6 lights to the north all making a triangular position.  As soon as I seen the first lights I hollered for my wife to bring the video camera.  I think we got about 50 seconds of the lights. They seemed to be lighting up off and on back an forth at each other. Then they moved closer to shore and they were so bright and low I could se! e the lights shining off the ocean. After that happened all at once it was gone and over. No noise no nothing. I tried ruling out that it was landing gear lights. Planes lights helicopter lights etc. But I know bwtter then that and I can tell the difference. My only conclusion is maybe the govt. Has some kind of noiseless cloaked airplane they were testing or it was indeed a ufo. Soon as I get home I will post tthe videos but if you type in google search &quotweird orange lights over myrtle beach&quot there are websites and videos dedicated to what we saw. We are leaving Saturday morning but I will be watching tonight and tomorrow night to see if I can get another view of this. There was no sound and the lights seemed like they were attached to some sort of craft but if that is so then the crafts were different in size because some had lights that lit up in a line that had 4 or 6 lights in a row.  When I get home I will submit the video, I can't here because all I have is! my iPad and I don't have a card reader for it.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Fireball and bright objects shooting through the sky that took formation into a Y then disappeared.;2013-07-03 22:10:00;5-10 minutes;fireball and bright objects shooting through the sky that took formation into a Y then disappeared On July 3, 2013, around 10:10 pm, my friend and I were sitting in my car that was parked infront of her house, off a side street that runs parallel to Forestbrook Ave, facing towards Conway (a bordering city to Myrtle Beach). As we were talking she said to look up at the shooting star. As I looked up the object did infact look like a shooting star but then it started to glow even brighter and looked like the back end of the object had caught on fire. I quickly got out of my car because the first thought I had was that it was a plane that had caught on fire since we live pretty close to the airport. As I started to pay more attention to the object I realized it was moving at an unbelievable speed. It crossed the sky almost in the blink of an eye. I hurried up and took my phone out and began to video tape it. The way the object cut through the sky was unlike anything Id ever seen before. Then as it began to slow down another bright white object came into view as! well as 3 others. The original object shot up in the sky higher than the others did and just hovered there. Then my eyes shifted to the remaining 4 objects. They started to make a Y formation. One at each end and one at the intersecting point. They stayed in this formation as the other just hovered above them. I believe they were in it for no more than 5 to 8 minutes. As this was happening one of her neighbors stopped on their way home and observed it with us. As we were watching the formation it seemed to come together but my attention was drawn to the top object as it started to drift down towards the ground. We watched it for as long as we could till the tree line covered it. I have never seen anything like this. Not the speed, movements, formation, or the brightness of these objects ever in my life. About 10 minutes after we noticed several airplanes and helicopters in sky in that area as if they were looking for something. I also watched the way those planes and helic! opters moved and their speed. It was not even comparable to ho! w fast a nd smooth those objects moved around the sky. Myself and my friend are both females in our early 20s and have college degrees. We both have serious professionals careers and take what we do serious.  The other observer was probably early 50s and male. He saw most of what we saw too and agreed that it was something that he had never seen before.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Five orange orbs over the Atlantic Ocean at Myrtle Beach.;2014-05-13 22:30:00;3 minutes;Five orange orbs over the Atlantic Ocean at Myrtle Beach. I was on the beach, deep in thought when I saw a total of 5 orange orbs, pretty far out over the ocean.  I am an avid sky watcher and weather spotter for the national weather service...  I was very curious after the first one.  I paid closer attention, to see if there were any sparks or tails, which there were none.  At this point I determined these were not fireworks or falling stars. First single ball, then approx. 30 seconds later, another about 4 oclock from the first and 3 inches away by the naked eye.  The third was smaller than the rest, back to back with the 2nd and was very close, slightly right and lower. (5 oclock)  Approx. 45 sec-1 min went by.  The 4th was farther left than the 1st by 2 inches. 15 - 20 sec. later the 5th orb appeared 7 inches away from the 4th, farthest right of all. (4 oclock)   I would consider this to be a distorted Z pattern... shorter and wide.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364

Sometimes these lights were spread out and other times very very close and blinked in patterns.  I'm aware that others noticed these lights as well and we're attempting to record them.  An aircraft took off from the nearby airport as the lights were still visible and flew directly into the area of them and then immediately returned to the airport.

The objects were different sizes, one larger and the second somewhat smaller.  From the shore line, the objects were in an easterly direction over the ocean.  At the time of the sighting, the lights did not move at all and no audible noise came from the direction of the objects.  There was also no reflection of the objects on the surface of the ocean.  Within a minute of the initial sighting, the objects disappeared from view the larger one disappeared first and then the smaller one.  No further lights were seen that night.  The next day, several customers of the same hotel reported seeing the same lights around the same time, but none of them were together when the sightings were made.  It appears these are the same lights that have been repo! rted in the area of Myrtle Beach and vicinity over the last several years, including numerous sightings in early October of this year.;33.7071922563412;-78.9372522029364
