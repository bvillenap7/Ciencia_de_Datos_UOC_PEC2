Orangish, multiple light source objects appear out of nowhere, then vanish in the order they appear.;2005-05-24 21:15:00;7-10 minutes;Orangish, multiple light source objects appear out of nowhere, then vanish in the order they appear. Two friends and I were at the beach to watch the moonrise and I noticed a bright orange glow above the horizon.  We began debating about what this object was when another identical object came out of nowhere next to the other. Both objects seemed to be suspended in air.  They were made up of multiple lights of red, orange, and yellow.  A few minutes after the second object appeared a third one appeared, again out of nowhere, but looked larger or maybe closer than the other two.  The third object was higher above the horizon and maybe 30 degrees to the left of the other two.  The objects went away in the order they appeared.  After the second object disappeared the third seemed to be gone but came back(no movement, as if the lights were simply turned off).  When the third object left for good its lights blinked and it shot off.  When the objects appeared and left they made no vertical or horizontal movement.;32.7674;-79.8414
