Flashes in the sky, brighter than stars, then no more, and they're not lightning bugs.;2011-11-03 20:52:00;2 minutes;Flashes in the sky, brighter than stars, then no more, and they're not lightning bugs. Using the same description of the sighting reported on September 29th from the Saint Stephen area, we, my wife and I, have seen other sightings because of intense observation since the 9/29/11 report from Saint Stephen.   On three occasions we have seen flashes of light at around 9:30 in the evening, on clear starry nights, from the same visual perspective.   Tonight, we saw five distinct flashes, from the same area, very small movement from left to right, and then no more flashes after that.   The rime was, after reading David Davenport's description of his event, 8:52 and 45 seconds.  Time on telephone said 8:52 p.m., followed by about 15 seconds until it hit 8:53 p.m..  The sighting involved us looking north-northwest, at about 45 degrees in the sky.  Looking intensely towards any following lights in the same trajectory, we never saw anything after the five flashes we saw originally. Like I said, this has happened a few times since our first posting to this sight which was dated 09/29/2011.  Tonight we got the time and reported the area from which it was observed.   Thanks for doing what you do in maintaining this site!;33.3343;-79.9197
Activity, many crafts, in South Carolina..including Jets;2012-01-18 20:15:00;10 minutes;Activity, many crafts, in South Carolina..including Jets Looking directly to the north of the property, I called my wife and my son outside.   There were 4 flashing lights in the northerly direction heading east-north-east.  As we all watched, a large orb lit in the northeast for about two seconds.  It was easily 10 times brighter than anything in the sky.  It disappeared and the blinking lights continued heading that direction.  There is no moon tonight at this time and,extremely clear. As an aside, when I originally left my home, ..from the east I could hear jets heading up the coast of South Carolina from Charleston towards Myrtle Beach. My son and I looked at the lights that I described for around 15 minutes.  My daughter headed to her home 15 miles away in fear to be near to her husband.  My wife remained with us intermittently.  We tried to get something on video after the fact, when a light showed up to the east, and remained there, but could catch nothing on camcorder. Jets were present after the lights appeared and observed them during this period.  I have no doubt about this fact.  My son was amazed completely by what he was seeing.;33.3343;-79.9197
