Either 1 large craft or 6 objects, 4 escorting 2.;2014-01-15 19:45:00;12 minutes;Either 1 large craft or 6 objects, 4 escorting 2 I suddenly felt the urge to go outside. I asked my wife to get the night vision video equipment. I went outside and looked to the north.  The moon was full. Little or no wind. Clear for the most part.  I witnessed an orange sphere that de materialized from sight.  My wife came out and we were both looking north.  I began video taping the event and scanning the northern sky.  We then noticed some bright flashing lights to the north.  Three at first.  Then right behind the three flashing lights, we spotted an orange sphere. It was followed by a smaller red light or sphere.  That was followed by another flashing light.  The flashing lights were noticeably smaller than the larger orange and slightly smaller red spheres.  They were proceeding slowly to the west.  The duration of the event was about 10 and a half minutes of video.  Straight line path.  They flew behind some clouds but I continued the video until they became visible again.  The distance was pretty far, but the o! range sphere was about the size of an aspirin. Clearly round.  Very excited to have it on video at last. We lost sight of the objects due to trees to our west.  If these lights were fixed, the craft was easily in excess of 5 miles in length.  Also, there has been a good amount of military aircraft in the skies this evening. More than usual. The video is about 11 minutes in length, but please watch the whole thing.  It goes behind a cloud for about a minute and a half.  Also, if the six lights are one object, we are talking about an object over 5 miles in length.   Here is a video link to You Tube that I uploaded today:  http://youtu.be/rNvgg-qPCxw;33.3343;-79.9197
