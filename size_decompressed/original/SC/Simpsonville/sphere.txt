3 Blue/Green spheres sighted by two people in Northern sky, flying quickly in tight formation.;2012-08-29 22:00:00;2-3 seconds;3 Blue/Green spheres sighted by two people in Northern sky, flying quickly in tight formation. 3 spheres of a blue-green color were seen flying, in tight formation, in an arch across the Northern sky.  They appeared suddenly, arched across the sky, and then disappeared just as suddenly.  They did not appear to be flaming, or burning, but rather left a bluish/greenish tinted streak behind them that faded quickly as they moved.  Two of us saw them, and both of us were astonished at their speed, color and appearance.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
4 fire colored travelling balls of light--no sound.;2014-07-12 22:00:00;8 minutes;4 fire colored travelling balls of light - no sound Walked outside around 10:00 p.m. to water plants and saw a bright ball in the sky the color of fire travelling west.  It did not make any sound although it seemed fairly close.   The first ball faded away and another came into view at the same starting point, travelled the same path and faded away in the same spot.   And then a third and then a fourth.  Exact same thing.   None of them made a sound.   Recorded two on my old digital camera using video.   Video was not good, but shows color.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
Glowing brillant orb moving east to west.;2014-12-14 17:15:00;8 seconds;Glowing brillant orb moving east to west. A glowing, brightly lit orb with no discernible edges hovering above the tree line about 100 feet in the air.  It was moving quietly in an east to west direction.  The light was not bright enough to glare or hurt my eyes, but it was a brillant white.  The size would have been about the size of a medicine ball.  There are no streets in line with the path it was taking.It faded off into the horizon just before dusk. I am posting this because two weeks prior my husband saw a similar thing, he said he thought something must be wrong with his eyes.  His UFO was more cylinder shaped. There was another posting in our city. The only aircraft that fly this path are repaired helicopters going and coming from Donaldson, AFB.  Occasionally we will see a fighter jet or troop carrier/cargo plane.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
Spherical color-changing light seen in the NE sky.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the star, Capella?  PD));2017-10-05 23:00:00;3 hours;Spherical color-changing light seen in the NE sky. On the night of Thursday, October 5th, 2017, ~10:58-11:15pm, EDT  I was in the den, when my wife came in and said, “Look out the side window, there is something there I can’t explain!”  As we looked into the NE sky at approximately 45-50 degrees from 0 degrees north, we observed a colorful sphere about the size of a small marble or a large BB at arm’s length seemingly bobbing up and down just above the tree line approximately 45 degrees from the horizon.  To the naked eye, it appeared like spherical net lighting that you use on Christmas shrubs or small trees and it looked like it blinked from red to blue (or green) to yellow (or white).  We also focused binoculars on it and was the same effect (changing colors spherical net lighting). After scrambling to find my camera (a Cannon T2i with a EF-S 55-250mm lens) and took the following footage and pictures (will be sent).  It was the most amazingly beautiful, non-living thing I have ever seen as it appeared to be series of images of different colored balls resembling our planets and/or other colored spheres including Earth so the view with the naked eye and even with the binoculars looked different!  As I took several short clips (to make their file sizes small), I was waiting for my battery to die, which it eventually did. One weird thing are the triangular blue and red reference points or dots on my images slightly to the left of the pictures and footage.  I also noticed that the camera would work sometimes and not others so I kept restarting it.  When I was recharging the battery for the Canon, I tried my iPhone 6 which did not provide any discernible images.  Later shots about ½ an hour afterwards with my battery charged just enough, I noticed it had moved much as a star would but at an angle up (towards the East up and clockwise), not straight up as most stars would rise.  I knew it wasn’t Venus or Mars because as I remember it, Venus and Mars were due to rise at the same time (~5:22am) about 6 hours later that same morning.  It did resemble Venus in intensity but not in color.  Also, there was no noise coming from the object.  When I went to bed around 2:00am it was higher in the sky but still visible. I am currently a High School Physics teacher, posses a BA in Physics and worked on three different NASA contracts in the 1980s and 90s for 5-1/2 years: Space Station Freedom (which never materialized), COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) @ Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD, and at NASA Headquarters in Washington DC.  Also, as part of my MS degree program, I have a Graduate Certification in Space Operations which includes Remote Sensing, Space Environment and Space Operations.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
