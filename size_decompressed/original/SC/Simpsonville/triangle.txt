Points of lights in the formation of a triangle spotted in Greenville county South Carolina.;2012-01-15 20:20:00;20 seconds;Points of lights in the formation of a triangle spotted in Greenville county South Carolina. I had stepped outside of my house and lit a cigarette.  I had seen something in the sky out of the corner of my eye and I looked up and saw 3 yellowish orange solid lights in the formation of a triangle just sitting there and not moving at all. I then moved to my right a little bit to get out of the range of a tree and it slowly started moving upwards in a diagonal direction for about 3 seconds.  Next as I stared at it, it got faster and faster for about 5 seconds and suddenly disappeared. It was definitely much faster than an airplane or helicopter.  I then looked up for about a minute and saw nothing but a few stars.   Finally I ran inside my neighbor's house to tell them and we called the hotline.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
