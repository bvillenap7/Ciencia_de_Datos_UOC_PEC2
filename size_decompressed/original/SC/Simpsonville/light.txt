I was traveling roughly southwest in my car on highway 146 at 45 mph. It first entered my field of view from the left side, or from the east. The object appeared round in shape and was glowing brightly, it was whiteish in color. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and seemed to stay just barely below the high overcast until it left my field of view moving westerly. The object never changed direction nor did it change speed. I work in the tire industry as a mechcanical/electrical troubleshooter. I have done this for 12 years. Prior to that I was a machinist for 5 years.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021

An identical sighting almost one year after the first one over the SC sky;2020-12-02 15:20:00;00:03:47;An identical sighting almost one year after the first one over the SC sky I was moments away from arriving home when in the sky I saw what looked like a plane with a contrails at first. The difference was is that it was not a plane and instead of moving like a plane this object first moved down torward the ground  emote stopping and remaining still for what seemed like an eternity. That was when I noticed a smaller light above the larger object then directly below those two coming from the left side of the sky there was what looked like a plane with a trail flying from left to right but it was a straight line. My video looks identical to a sighting that I found from exactly one year ago in South Carolina also. Same time of day and all. Very strange;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
