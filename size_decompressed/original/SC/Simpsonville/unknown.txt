Literally, right by us.  Close enough to scare us.  It was so fast that all we saw was a big darkish blur.   It passed us on the left hand side and it was going the opposite direction from us.  We both turned back to see what it was but we didn't see anything.   I've never heard of or experienced anything like that.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
Two very bright orange objects moving at an extremely high speed across the sky.;2018-03-31 23:30:00;30-45 seconds;Two very bright orange objects moving at an extremely high speed across the sky. My husband and I were walking into our home and I saw a bright orange object moving very fast across the night sky.  I asked him what it was and as we watched we then saw another one that looked identical flying across the sky just as fast.  We watched them until they were out of sight.   We've never seen anything of that nature;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
