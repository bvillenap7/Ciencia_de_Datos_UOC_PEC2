They were shielding their eyes because of the sun!  No clouds at all. I asked what they were looking at and they pointed up! To my amazement their was this cylindrical almost snake like object floating in the sky.  It was very high in the sky and moving slowly.  It looked black but as it would turn it would change to a silver color.  We watched it until it slowly moved on, either disappearing or moved higher in the sky so that we could not see it. My neighbor took 5 pictures with his phone it did not show up in any of the photos.  I am still in awe of it.  I just thought it would be worth having a record of it.  Thank you.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
