Suddenly we both see a white/yellowish light traveling south at an incredibly high speed (approx 1000mph or more). The object did not descend or slow down. It was traveling at a constant speed at approx.a  few thousand feet high. It was very quiet outside and the object did not emit any sound whatsoever nor did it have any blinking lights nor a headlight. We continued to watch the object until it left our field of view, not losing speed or altitude. I have seen many strange looking objects in the sky before which were explainable by either natural phanomena or conventional aircraft. Unfortunately, this object did not pause in mid-air nor had made any right angle turns, but I believe it was worth reporting, so hopefully you can give us some kind of insinght or info regarding our sighting. Thank you very much for your time. P.S. Both of us were sober at the time of the sighting and do not have any interest in making pranks nor making false reports.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
