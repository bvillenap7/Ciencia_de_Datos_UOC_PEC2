Trail and horizontal lighted craft.  ((anonymous report))  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a contrail??  PD));2016-12-15 17:50:00;10 minutes;Trail and horizontal lighted craft Let my dog outside to backyard.  Saw what looked like a hazy white trail leading straight down to horizontal lights (3 blinking right to left white? and red in a row) midway down from the night sky.  I went into my house after a minute or so to get my camera to zoom in to see what it was.  This took about a minute and a half to two minutes.   When I went back outside and looked in the same general area, the trail and craft were no longer visible.  I looked all round the sky, and saw to my right and further up and farther away in the distance what appeared to be the same pattern of blinking lights traveling to the right a very fast pace.  I then went from my backyard thru my carport to the front yard hoping to capture an image or video, but just that quick- it was not in sight.   After squinting my eyes trying to locate it, I think I caught sight of it even higher and further away and so faint, it was hard to say for sure that that is what it actually was.  Of note, to the left of the trail/craft and higher up I noticed what I'm assuming to be the North Star looking exceptionally bright.
