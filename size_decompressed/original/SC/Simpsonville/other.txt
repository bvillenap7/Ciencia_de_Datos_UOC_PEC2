Dim, low orbit, high detail, backyard satellite shaped object, hazed by distance.;2007-11-10 18:00:00;5 minutes;Dim, low orbit, high detail, backyard satellite shaped object, hazed by distance. Well this object was really high up, like in orbit....bear with me. It looked like a satellite dish. I would of checked the saucer shaped box, but the bottom was moving in the direction of travel. Basically it looked like a backyard satellite dish, but it was so far away it had that blue haze on it, like viewing a mountain, or high altitude airplane from a distance. The sun was starting to set, but the sky was still lit fairly well. 3 other people saw it, but everyone just assumed it was a satellite. Now i might be wrong but this didnt look like your traditional NASA satellite with the solar arays and what not, and even if it was it would of had to been in a super low orbit, and ginourmous for us to of seen the detail that we saw. It moved in a constant direction, with a constant speed, until it disappeard into the horizon.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
Lots of yellowish lights with red flashing lights at the end.;2013-02-11 23:30:00;7 seconds;Lots of yellowish lights with red flashing lights at the end. I was laying in bed and heard a VERY loud sound outside.  I thought it was an airplane but it was too loud to be that.  The sound was shaking my window and pictures on my walls. I pulled up my blinds and there was an elongated kind of trapezoid looking shape with multiple bright yellowish lights and big flashing red lights at the end of it. It didn't look like anything I'd seen before so I came here and read the last report for SC, it also mentioned what seems like a good description of what I saw, Reddish flashing lights on the side or rear of the bright yellowish lights..;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
Burning object in the sky with balls of molten material falling from it.;2016-12-23 20:45:00;10 minutes;Burning object in the sky with balls of molten material falling from it. Saw very bright fireball in the sky over Woodruff Rd.  Simpsonville/Mauldin area.  Had what looked like molten metal dropping off of it as it went through the sky.   We thought it was a meteor or space junk, but it changed direction.  Heading was Southwest originally then went and turned and went Northwest, until it disappeared slowly out of sight.  Looked like an Indian head dress in the sky (best way I can describe it).   Pulled off Woodruff Rd into a subdivision to video it with our phone.  It never lost altitude, just changed direction and went out of site.  There was no trail left behind it.  Happened around 8:45 PM.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
