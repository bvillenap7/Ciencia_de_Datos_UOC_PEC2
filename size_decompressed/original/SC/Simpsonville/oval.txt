A large pulsing green oval traveled across the sky in an arcing trajectory in a horizontal direction.  The object was lower than the typical altitude of a plane, but higher than the tree line.  The object moved at relatively fast pace towards the north.  I slowed my vehicle to try and track the object, but it had already accelerated out of sight.;34.7432867083646;-82.2607938233021
