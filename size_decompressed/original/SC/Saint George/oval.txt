It was an oval shaped object.  It had flashing white lights on the bottom.  I saw it just over a corn field that Thursday night.  It just hovered in one spot and then it shot off.  I didn't even see it leave.  I ran home immediately and told everyone.  They didn't believe me.  I hope you do.;33.1898;-80.5659
