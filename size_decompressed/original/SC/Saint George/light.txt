Strange white light in sky along with other aircraft;2011-12-15 21:55:00;40 min;strange white light in sky along with other aircraft I had been hearing many aircraft flying over my house.  Both military rotor wing and fixed wing jets.  They were seemingly flying in some pattern as if they were looking for something.  Standing on my steps I saw a very bright round light moving south to north probably 400 feet in the air.  It made no sound, was not blinking, just a white light.  The aircraft were in the immediate area of this object, as if they were trying to observe it also.  This same type of sighting happened on Dec 14 2011 near St George SC.;33.1898;-80.5659
