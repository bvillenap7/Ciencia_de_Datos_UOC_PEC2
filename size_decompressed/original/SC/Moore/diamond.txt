My house faces North and the object was traveling very slowly primarily towards the East and moving away from me in a slightly Northward direction.  It was low about the altitude you would see a helicopter or small engine plane. The best way to describe it is that it appeared the object was on fire (bright orangish-red) on the top surface in a dome shape and the glow extended very slightly downward.  It also appeared that the bright lights extended towards the front and the rear but in more of a pointed shape.  It was visible to me for about 2 or so minutes until it slowly faded out as it moved away from me.  It never seemed to change speeds and never seemed to change altitude. I usually do not do this (i.e. send out this type of thing), but I was very intrigued by it.  After checking this website, I read someone else’s account (Greer – 11/8/11) and it sounds almost exactly like what I saw tonight so I decided to send this in.  My family thought I was fooling around with them until I read the Greer sighting to them after I tried to explain what I saw.  Even though this is New Year’s Eve, I have only been drinking diet coke so my account is about as genuine as it can be.;34.8646;-82.0214999999999
