Large object with one bright white at each corner (square shaped) moving slowly and low over town. ((NUFORC Note:  From a/c mech.  PD));2013-04-15 21:35:00;1;large object with one bright white at each corner (square shaped) moving slowly and low over town 4 bright white lights with two red ones in the center flew low, slow, and quietly over my house. It happened in the dark, so I couldn't see the shape of the aircraft, but it looked to be square by the layout of the lights. there was one light at each corner, with a double red light towards the middle.  this object flew extremely slow and had very little noise to it.  it sounded like it had at least two turbine engines on it, but they had no acoustic volume to them, they just made a quite noise as it flew. I am a pilot and aircraft mechanic, this is nothing I have ever seen or heard before!;34.1637;-80.8116000000002
