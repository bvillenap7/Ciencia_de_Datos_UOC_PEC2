Pinprick of blue-white light seen from the interstate that blurred in almost a digital fashion , seen early in the morning.;2001-04-02 07:25:00;5-7 min;Pinprick of blue-white light seen from the interstate that blurred in almost a digital fashion , seen early in the morning. I recently moved to Taylors S.C. while in the middle of the spring semester at my school. Since the move, I've had to make a 45min drive down I85 to get to exit 19B in Anderson S.C. to get to Tri-County Technical College in Pendleton S.C. in the morning. While driving past exit 35 on 85 I noticed an extremely bright object over the tree line. It was like a pinprick of blueish white light. Just by the objects appearance I was able to decern it was not any type of conventional aircraft. If it was a passenger jet really far away, then its lights were way too bright, If it wasn't very far away then it had no discernable shape and it hovered motionless in the air. From what I saw I think it was pretty far away though. One noticable event that happened was that the light blurred for one moment then returned to its normal brightness. When I say blurred I don't mean it looked as if it was obscurred or anything like that. It sort of fizzled. The thought immeadiatly came to my mind that it seemed almost pixilated like a distortion on a crappy computer monitor. I was on the interstate so I quickly got to a point where my vision was obscurred by the trees and I lost it completely.;34.5221322564099;-82.6452017948717
Unknown light hovering in sky toward Townville;2009-01-12 03:27:00;21 minutes;Unknown light hovering in sky toward Townville In the early hours of January the 12th, a friend and myself walked to my car and started it in an effort to get some heat on a cold morning. As we sat and waited for my car to get warm, I noticed a peculiarly bright light in the Western sky. The light caught my attention initially because it was the brightest light in the sky, much brighter than any of the stars. But then as I sat and watched it, I noticed it was traveling incredibly akward to be a plane. First off, it was traveling left to right, then remaining stationary (hovering like a helicopter), then continuing to take off again, sort of zig-zagging. As it proceeded this routine, I ran back inside and grabbed my digital camera and batteries (nothing substantial seemed to come out, but they're open for review). I did notice, however, as i tried to focus on the object with the camera, i could clearly see a purple, cyan, blue alternating color pattern (this could just be coincidental, but even with the naked eye an alternating strobe could be seen). All in all, I'm not saying it was ever close enough for me to say it was an alien craft or UFO. I am, however, asking for an explination for the object I most certainly witnessed in the sky. Take into concideration that my father has worked with airplanes his entire life and being that we live less than a mile from the city airport (that has no military connection), I'm familiar with the common planes. Thank you for your time;34.5221322564099;-82.6452017948717
Orange light that set down in woods, got brighter, then left;2010-01-05 20:10:00;Seven Minutes;Orange light that set down in woods, got brighter, then left I was at my car in my driveway (which is on a hill that lets you see a good long way over tons of tree tops) and I saw what at first I thought were airplanes. They were two orange lights and the one that was higher up was brighter. The dim one went out of view and again, I thought it was just an airplane, until the brighter orange ball seemed like it was getting closer. I then figured it was a helicopter (even though I have never seen a helicopter with that didnt have flashign lights and was a halogen orange), but I couldn’t hear it and it eventually landed on either a road or in woods, and then got brighter. I thought it might be a fire since it flickered, but then it got extremely bright (still orange) and came back up and then grew very dim. Then I realized it hadn’t gotten dimmer, it had just moved away from where I was very fast until it disappeared over the horizon. There were also planes flying overhead;34.5221322564099;-82.6452017948717
Odd light effect in clouds;2011-10-28 06:30:00;less than 1 min.;Odd light effect in clouds Low hanging clouds, with sunrise approximately an hour away, yet.  There is a heavy humidity, but no rain.  As I'm walking up the driveway, the clouds in front of me light up.  Left.(off) Center.(off)  Right.(off)   ALL OF THEM - the whole sky (so far as I can see), then off. It's a blue-ish light that appears to come from inside or behind the clouds.  It's slow, and crisp - with no random flashes like lightening usually produces.  Also, no thunder. I thought at first that my neighbor was spotlighting deer.  When I arrived at work though, my boss had also seen it.  He lives appx. 5-7 miles away - as the crow flies.;34.5221322564099;-82.6452017948717
Orange and red ball of lights moving slowing.;2013-05-26 22:00:00;15 minutes;Orange and red ball of lights moving slowing Observed orange ball surrounded by red flying over house and seemingly very close to ground.  Appeared to be moving very slowly and following a straight path.  It gradually got dimmer until gone.  It did not appear to disappear because of distance, but rather just gradually “go out”.  Then another appeared about 30 seconds later and followed same path and did same gradual disappearance.  When this second one was overhead, another one appeared over the trees behind house.  They were close together.  This “trail” of lights following same path, moving slowly, no noise, and gradually disappearing involved about 10 lights over about 15 minutes.  This is Memorial Day weekend and maybe these were some type of flares floating as a result of some fireworks.  But, we live in more of a country setting and as the lights appeared coming over the trees there were no indication of firework “sounds”.  This was close to Hartwell Lake.

But when we first noticed them we noticed a faint lime of light between them like it was connecting them.;34.5221322564099;-82.6452017948717
