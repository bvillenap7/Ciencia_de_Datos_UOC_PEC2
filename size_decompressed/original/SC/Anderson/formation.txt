I kept waiting for them to move one way or the other which they didn't.  I watched for a little less than a minute.  I could see a fighter jet approaching the same area from the lower left of the red lights.  As I watched both, the red lights disappeared and the jet came to that area..   The first  week of Jan. 2013 I saw a bright white light that dropped several thousand feet and went out as jets approached from both sides. I'm seventy years old and have been watching the skies since I could look up and I have never seen anything, all the time wishing that I could>   Now two sightings in two months..  I'm outside at all hours of the day and night because I don't smoke in my house.   I know I can't be the only one to have seen these two incidences...;34.5221322564099;-82.6452017948717

My granddaughter and I were driving down the Main Street in Anderson, SC.  She told me to lookin the sky.  There was between 50 to 75 objects hovering in the sky.  A couple had lights... they just kind of moved around and then began going into the sky in a line.   It was very low grey clouds and they disappeared into them.   I have pictures of it.  I cannot figure out what it could be.   I did call the police dept and reported what we saw.;34.5221322564099;-82.6452017948717
