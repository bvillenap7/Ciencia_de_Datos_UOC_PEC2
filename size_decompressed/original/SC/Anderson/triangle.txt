My wife, daughter and myself were walking across a restaurant parking lot to our car when my daughter asked what's that?    What we saw was a black object in the distance with no lights.  It was close to dusk, but the object stood out clearly because the sky behind it was still fairly light.   It appeared to be low flying (my first thought was an ultralight plane).  There was no noise, and it was moving in our direction.   It looked as if it would fly over close to us.  We watched it for at least a minute and decided we looked foolish out in the middle of the parking lot.   We turned toward our car and had to walk behind a small tree which blocked our view for a couple of seconds.  When we were past the tree we all looked and the object had disappeared.  The shape was roughly triangular with the points rounded.  My wife thought she saw a faint light at one point.  It seemed like it wobbled and didn't hold a straight path.;34.5221322564099;-82.6452017948717
Large unbelievably fast moving object that was like looking through a smudge on glass or a pool of water in the sky at night.;2012-03-15 21:45:00;15 seconds;Large unbelievably fast moving object that was like looking through a smudge on glass or a pool of water in the sky at night. At approximately 21:45 on March 15, 2012 there was 3 of us standing outside our apartment looking up towards the sky.  We saw a large object sort of triangle shaped, which looked to be a few 100 feet above us.  It was moving to the north west at a very rapid speed and completely silent.  The surface of it can only be described as reflective in the night sky.  It appeared to have very dim lights, atleast 3-4, but it was more like it was reflecting the city lights.  It was almost as if you were looking through a smudge on a window, moving at a rate of speed that was indescribable.  Another way to describe it would be like in a Star Trek movie when a Klingon ship was uncloaking.  Like a pool of water going across the sky.  We only saw it for a few seconds and it disappeared beyond the tree line.  Very amazing sight to see.  Wish we could describe it better.  The size was like that of a boeing 757 flying very low.;34.5221322564099;-82.6452017948717
