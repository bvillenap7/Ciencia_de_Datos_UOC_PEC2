The lights appeared to be a foot apart along a straight axis when the object passed beyond a tree line that is 300 yards away.;2015-04-11 20:34:00;10 minutes;We live in a rural area at least 7 miles to the nearest small town.   My wife took our dogs out that night so they could do their business before calling it a night.  She called me to the front door to look at what she was seeing in the night sky.  One of our dogs will bark at any and everything but he made no sound.   Three lights were flashing with equal brightness and equal separation as witnessed from our front yard.  The lights appeared to be a foot apart along a straight axis when the object passed beyond a tree line that is 300 yards away.  There was no audible sound from the object.  It passed beyond a tree line that is 450 yards away and then back again.   Before the flying object passed from sight the last time, the lights on my truck that was parked in a shed came on by their self.  When the object was out of sight the lights on my truck went off.
