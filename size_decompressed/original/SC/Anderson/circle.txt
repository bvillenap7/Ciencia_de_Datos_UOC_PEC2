no noise, with no light, but with white glow, no markings, very close to ground and moving slow 1974-75;1975-06-30 20:00:00;5 minute;no noise, with no light, but with white glow, no markings, very close to ground and moving slow 1974-75 33 years later, I am starting to tell people what I saw as a young man.  I lived in small subdivision that was surrounded by farms, I was walking home trying to get home before dark from friends house.  It was a very clear summer night.  As I got to my driveway, all of a sudden I seen this object just about 40-50 feet in the air above me. At first I was amazed, I thought helicopter, then immediately realized that there was no noise. The object had a glow to it, but there was no source of light.  It appear to be just floating, moving very slow.  For some strange reason, I was not scared. It moved across the street in a northerly direction over the neighbors house. I ran across the street, then through the woods behind the neighbors house that backed up to the pasture. Normally, I would have never ran into the woods at night.    I watched this object slowly follow the couture of the land, and just disappear over the trees at the other end of the pasture.   I am very clear on what I saw. I did not tell anyone, including my parents. I am now 46 years old, intelligent, and not crazy.  I was watching a segment on TV about some air force personnel somewhere, I could not even watch the show, when they started to describe the object.   It was identical to what I had seen.

Round, black basketball-like, silent flying object.;2019-04-27 20:15:00;1 minute;Round, black basketball-like, silent flying object. I observed for about a minute a black basketball-like object as it traveled north with no sound or lights.  I first thought it might be a drone, but it was jet black, perfectly round, and drones are required to have aviation lights, and this object had no lights.;34.5221322564099;-82.6452017948717
