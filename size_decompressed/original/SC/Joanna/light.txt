Bright object western SC for over 4 hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2020-03-17 21:30:00;4 hours;Bright object western SC for over 4 hours At our RV Park, I was closing a curtain and noticed a very bright oval shape light toward the west. I got my son and we took a few pictures. Saw commercial aircraft fly between our location and light, it would pulse and would dim if planes got close. after 4 hours moved toward west (or up) slowly until dimmed out of view. It was also seen 2-3 weeks earlier by a guest west of us as well. It gave off no sound even tho I could hear the other aircraft.;34.4075;-81.8237
