Blue light stricking in the sky.;2004-05-30 20:00:00;Under a minute;Blue light stricking in the sky. This is the description my 9 year old son gave me of the object he saw. About 8:00PM at night he was looking out his window. He noticed a bright neon blue light about two to three times the size of the largest and brightness star in the sky. From about the top of the horizan the object streaked down. It appeared to be some distance away. He said that the object was moving faster than any planes he had ever seen in the sky, but didn't move so fast to leave a tail or tracer. He is unsure if the object blinked on and off or if it appeared that way because he was seeing it from behind some tree limbs. After a few seconds the object disappeared behind a mountain across from us. I would have been skeptical to file a report for him except I feel he is familiar with the night sky, stars and the appearance of aircraft in the area. We enjoy the sky and stars and watch them on a regular basis.;34.8987;-82.7073
