She noticed it first and pointed it out.   I tried with only a smartphone, to record it.  It was too dark, and there's nothing but audio to support my claim.   We've seen planes, helis, and even fireworks, over the past couple years, but this impressed me.   A fireball moving across the sky laterally, but with obvious trajectory.   If anybaody else saw this, let me know.;34.8987;-82.7073
