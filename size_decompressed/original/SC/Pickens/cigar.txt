The time was between 9:30 and 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2007. I was one of four grandmotherly women at a rural gas station at the foot of Table Rock Mountain in Pickens Co., SC.  Two of the women -- both retired newspaper reporters -- were talking at the gas pump with the woman who runs the store, when she suddenly pointed into the sky and all observed what they said were (at least) two cigar -- or tube-shaped wingless, exhaustless, noiseless aircraft crossing the sky overhead.  I am severly crippled so by the time I got out of the car to look, the things had passed over and were hidden by trees.  It was not clear how many there were, as one of the women saw only one.  The store owner said that two days before, on a Sunday, she had seen five such objects go over, in formation, and two army-type helicopters seemed to be either accompanying them or trying to intercept them.  But they were fast and soon disappeared over the mountains.  One of the women, an experienced news photographer, tried to photograph them but the extreme brightness of the sky and their high altitude made it impossible.  I reported this sighting to the FAA in Atlanta, the RADAR room at the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport and the Flight Standards Office in Columbia, SC, where I was directed to you.;34.8987;-82.7073
