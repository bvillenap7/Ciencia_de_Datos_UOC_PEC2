3 Silver Triangular Ships close and low disappeared as I turned around;1993-07-14 20:00:00;5 minutes;3 Silver Triangular Ships close and low disappeared as I turned around Date at present is 3/31/2020.  Siting occurred early-mid 90's, around 8 pm.  Dusk, but still daylight, no headlights needed.  Driving self home from grocery store.  Less than a half mile from home, while crossing RR tracks, something told me to look up.  No other cars behind me or in front, small rural area/town.  I see 3 silver, triangular ships, very low, no noise, as close together as they could be, just silently floating.  I jumped out of the still running car, as they were passing overhead and I wanted to see where they were going, as they were not something I had ever seen before and I was perplexed.  As soon as I jumped out of the car I turned around to see their direction and they had disappeared.  Never have forgotten the event.  Still see it all in my mind.  Wondered about it since.;34.383;-81.1109
