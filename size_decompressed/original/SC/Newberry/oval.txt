A UFO came out from the top of the trees, came down HWY 34 and stopped at my car.  The UFO hovered over my car.  I stopped my car and it continued to hover.  I got out of my car and then the next thing I remember is i was back in my car, leaning over, and I heard my door shut.  I lost 25 minutes getting home.  A flying creature followed it.  It saw me also and chased the UFO. My car gave off an electronic magnetic field as my husband checked my car when I got home.  When I got home, I had a circular puncture wound on my left cheek on my face.;34.2876;-81.62
