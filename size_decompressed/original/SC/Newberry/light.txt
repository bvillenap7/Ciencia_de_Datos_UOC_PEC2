Sun shining white light brighter than the sun.;2014-04-26 15:35:00;45-60 seconds;Sun shining white light brighter than the sun. Approximately 15:35 in the SW clear bright sunny sky, we saw a bright light with a motion similar to a jet plane doing fighting manoviers..   The light appeared on and off then we saw a black object.   We did not hear a jet sound or airplane then it disappeared.   It seemed to be very high altitude around the same as a commercial jet liner.  It was very exciting.;34.2876;-81.62
