Silver Cigar-shaped object at 7:38 am in Lamar, SC;2010-01-18 07:38:00;5 minutes;Silver Cigar-shaped object at 7:38 am in Lamar, SC This morning was a very clear and sunny morning. I didn't see any clouds in the sky. I was on my way to work traveling down W. Seven Pines in Lamar, SC. I just crossed over route 403 and continued on down Seven Pines.  I immediately saw a silver reflection in the sky to my left over a huge bare-ground field.  I noticed it immediately because the sun was to my right, and had a sharp shine on the object up in the sky to my left. It was very clear to see. The object was at least 2,000 - 3,000 feet up, traveling very slowly back the opposite direction from me.  This is very unusual as I travel this road every day for the past 2 years and have NEVER seen a plane or any object for that matter traveling over this field or anywhere near it at this early in the morning. The object could have been a plane, but I was staring at it and could not see any wings at all.  The object was very long, silver, and shaped like the typical cigar shape other people report, and was incredibly shiny from the sun reflecting off it's body. I pulled over onto the side of the road and watched it slowly move on at about 20 - 30 miles an hour, estimated.  I never saw any wings. I never saw any smoke or exhaust trail either.  I had my window rolled down and no noise at all from the object. Could it have been a plane? Maybe...but I didn't see any wings.  Any planes usually leave exhaust trails as well as noise.  My first reaction was, wow a cigar shaped object....not oh look a plane. Any one else see this object this morning?;34.1832;-80.0994
