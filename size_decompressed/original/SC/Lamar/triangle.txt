((HOAX??))  4 winged shaped ufos flying 2 or 300 feet with 2 jets flowing and a government car in the middle of the day.;2013-07-01 02:20:00;4 minutes;4 winged shaped ufos flying 2 or 300 feet with 2 jets flowing and a government car in the middle of the day i was pressure washing outside by the pole my 3 kids were swimming and started yelling look look what are those!   i turned to the right and looked up and i seen a jet about 2 or 300 feet above the trees moving slow for a jet south.  i turned on around and opposite of the jet was four triangle shaped things. the color of the shapes were dark don't know if they were black or dark gray,  more black than gray.  there shape was like a pterodactyl,  they were not birds the wings were very wide close in and went to a point just like two triangles that meat butt to butt with a small cone out the back and a bigger looking cone out the front. one would fly out of formation and come back then  the one on the other side would fly out.there was a large circle around the sun like a rainbow and a thunderstorm coming also but it wasn't here yet,  this made it easy to see the 4 objects.  they were about 2 or 300 feet above my house,  the sun hight right and the storm  to the left so they showed up really well. at first i thought that it was hang gliders but when they moved that put that to rest,they were to fast for that and they never lost altitude like hang gliders do.  with the jets flying around and then a government car stopped in the middle of the rode,  i just know it was a ufo.the car stayed for about 10 minutes after the ufos had gone and the jet circled back once.;34.1832;-80.0994
