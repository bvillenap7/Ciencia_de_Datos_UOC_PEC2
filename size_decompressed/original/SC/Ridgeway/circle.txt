The driveway is a long driveway, about halfway down we saw two lights coming down this driveway. We both saw these lights, I thought it was a car coming down this driveway.I was fixing to say something about this car coming down at a pretty good speed. This car should have stopped to let us pass. As we went pass the end of the driveway my husband and myself looked up the driveway and saw nothing, no car or truck, it had not turned to right or left and nothing was blocking our view. My husband asked what happen to that car. As I have thought about this and asked the person who lives at this address if anyone was leaving at that time of night, they said no. These lights did not put out beams of light like a car light.;34.3189;-80.925
