Bright orb spotted in the sky.;2013-07-17 17:30:00;2 seconds;Bright orb spotted in the sky. I was laying on my couch watching TV.  It was during a thunderstorm, and I had seen periodic flashes of lightning.  This was not lightning.  In the window next to the TV, a bright circle flashed in the sky.  It appeared very briefly, perhaps for 2 seconds, before vanishing.  It was an extremely bright, white light similar to lightning, but it was circular.   I could faintly hear a sound similar to a train or tornado and when I stepped outside to investigate, the sound faded quickly.;34.3189;-80.925
