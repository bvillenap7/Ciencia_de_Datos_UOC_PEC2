I'm using iPhone 5 word processor to report this incident for my wife.  We live 1/4 mile deep in the woods off a public dirt/gravel road off Hwy 34  6 mi. E of Ridgeway, SC. 29130.   My wife let our cat  out at 1:18am (6/1/13) & had her Pantech phone in her hand & was looking to take a pic of the moon but saw an usually bright, large star?  She thought. She took several pics of it from our front yard.  Living where we do, it is dark here.   She took  7 pix with her cell camera.  When we saw the images 6/1/13  mid-morning.  I had her text them to my iPhone so I could use my iPhone's use its standard photo software to enlarge the images & keep her originals as they are.  Only the bright blue light a bluish light in center & a less bright white at the other end (on the same plane) underneath remain constant.  It looks like several squares together but not touching.   Pic 2 looks like the same square base but now it has 2 stacks of boxes with 1 top box on & in the center of the 2 stacks but not actually touching the stacks.   Pic 3 looks like the same square base but now has a child's top looking thing with the tip of the top in the center of the square & standing at 90 degrees to base.  Pic 4 shows nothing but the  3 lighted areas.pic 5 has the 3 lights & a white thing that looks like a white camper on the plane of lights.   Pic 5 has changed to a beer can look. Pic 6 is same as 5.;34.3189;-80.925
