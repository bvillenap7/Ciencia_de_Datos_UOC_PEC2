We were outside for about 10 minutes at 9:30 pm(04/20/2020). We heard our cat meowing very close then very far- seconds apart - we thought something had got her and moved her- because she was meowing really close to our lawn again- I looked up and noticed a grey rainbow in the sky above us & told my girls to look because it was really odd to see in the night sky.  We kept hearing our cat very close and seconds later very far away.  After about 10 minutes trying to get her in, I was still looking in the woods when I saw an extremely white triangular light coming from the woods- I froze thinking who is driving in the woods- then common sense kicked in and I thought- there is no way any vehicle could drive through the woods as it is so dense- and I could not comprehend the shape of the light coming towards us-it was the point of a triangle of white light - lighting up the entire woods -! coming towards us- at that point I turned- yelled to my girls to get in the house- they were yelling, running and asking me if I saw the bright yellow lights lighting the tree tops up- It was very surreal -;34.727;-81.6156000000001
