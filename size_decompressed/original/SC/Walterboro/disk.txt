circular disc with oberservation windows floating in the sky.;2003-12-20 17:00:00;10 minutes;circular disc with oberservation windows floating in the sky. We were traveling north on I95 just before the junction with I26 in South Carolina. I look up right at dusk and saw what I thought was a aircraft. I keep watching and as it got closer I noticed a unusual landing light formation. The closer it got the clear it became. It was a round type of craft with two rows of what appeared to be oberservation windows quite wide in the front of the craft. The were fully lighted and the craft appeared to be just floating along. We pulled over and observed as it went over head. It made no sound as it was only a mile or so over head. The lights wrapped around theright side of the craft. We could not see anyone , but felt we were being watched. I am wondering if anyone else reported any sightings around that area. It was quite large, we couldn't believe what we were seeing.;32.908;-80.6671000000001
