strange moving light;2010-11-07 01:13:00;still moving;strange moving light Thought this was a star at first but it started moving.  Up down then back and fourt from left to right one second then changing moving all around. It is still out there moving around right now.  From my location in walterboro it is in sky aprox. in a east south east direction.  It was very strange moving it would move stop still and move quickly in the oposit direction.  It still looks like a star but I know that a star does not move around like that.;32.908;-80.6671000000001
