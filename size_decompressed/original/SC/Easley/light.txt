Bright white light moving in cloudless pre-dawn sky suddenly disappears;2008-01-01 06:10:00;2 min.;Bright white light moving in cloudless pre-dawn sky suddenly disappears I noticed Venus in the east and then noticed what I thought was an equally bright planet probably about 30 degrees east if Venus and lower in the sky.  Realizing that Venus is normally the brightest object in the sky, I assumed it must be a plane and stared at it for a bit to see if it was moving.  It did appear to be approaching so I kept trying to make my eyes focus on it.  Rather than one bright light as I am accustomed to seeing on airplanes in the early morning, this object appeared to have a ring of several lights, not exactly in a circle formation, but more like a closed half-circle.  I heard nothing, even though this object seemed to be fairly low. I woke my husband to see if his eyes could make this object look like something we had seen before, but he agreed that the lights seemed to form this half-circle.  To be honest, I could not make my 45 year-old eyes focus well enough to count the lights, but there only seemed to be four or five at most.  As we watched it together for the next minute or so, it suddenly disappeared.  We ran outside to see if there was cloud cover, but there was not a cloud in sight.;34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
Bright light with three different colored lights attached and danced across the sky for several house.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2009-04-27 21:00:00;2 hours;Bright light with three different colored lights attached and danced across the sky for several house. Bright light with three different colored lights attatched (blue, green, and red).  Blinked a lot. Moved unlike anything I've ever seen before.  It could not have been a helicopter because the moves it did would have crashed a helicopter.  Not a weather ballon because it did not follow the wind. And no plane that I've ever seen could stop in midflight and move from left to right.  It was completely silent.  It danced across the sky for several hours, I only stopped watching because I got tired. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
Driving and saw stationary flashing white light in passing.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2015-12-01 01:55:00;Unknown;Driving and saw stationary flashing white light in passing.   I've been in this area my whole life and have never saw this at all!  It definitely wasn't a radio tower. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
50 light anomalies headed north east in PERFECT FORMATION AND SPACING apart.  ((Starlink satellites??);2020-04-28 21:00:00;18 minutes;50 light anomalies headed north east in PERFECT FORMATION AND SPACING apart. I only started counting after I was gathering what I was watching realizing what I seen was really happening I definitely counted 39 but there had to be 50 1by 1 by 1 appearing and moving in this perfectly straight formation mathematically perfect spacing between each light could fool you for a star if it weren't moving .... and they all moved so fast for such altitudes SO MANY OF THEM BUT after the last of them dissappear five minutes later only one singular light appears from the direction these 50 some headed into it head to where those 50 came out of into this fog but never came back into sight this one was alone and could move in such manners the defy our laws in physics itself. And this one got bigger shaped like brighter flashes it flashed 4 times before dissappeared for good;34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
