I am prior USAF SSGT, Retire after 23 years of government service.  What I seen last night was not an Air Craft.  I was out to take a picture of the super moon on the 26 April.  In the sky between to trees just above the lake I saw to bright white lights at the tail section. I could make out a dark triangular shape it was just hovering. The moons light was reflecting off the object.  I could not believe what I was looking at, I just froze! My mind could not wrap around what I was looking at. I just stood there looking at this thing.  I then realized I had my camera and before I could take a picture the object shot straight up to the north and was gone in less then a second.;34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
