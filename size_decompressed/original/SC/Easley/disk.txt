The craft floated over our car and on top of a house !!!;2000-10-20 20:00:00;maybe a minute;The craft floated over our car and on top of a house !!! This even took place about 5 years ago . I remember it like it was yesterday . My dad , my brother , and I were in our car and were on our way to my dads girlfriend's house . It was very dark and cold and I was sitting in the backseat looking out my window . And from a distance I noticed a tiny object that had shimmering white light . I always watched shows on TV about aliens and so I told my dad that I think I see a UFO . My dad looked and said it was probably a helicopter . Well we came around a few streets and it looked like the craft was getting bigger and heading for our direction . Then my dad changed his mind and said he didn't know what the craft was . I was very young at this time so my brother and me was getting scared . As we came up this hill the object came over some trees and we saw that it was a saucer shape . I was terrified . My dad stopped the car in the middle of the street . There were no other cars in sight . The craft slowly flauted over our vehicle and into a yard where it floated over the top of a tiny house . I didn't know what to do . I was screaming telling my dad to go because I didn't want to get abducted !!! I thought it was going to blow that little house up !!! So as my dad slowly started to move the craft began to come out over the street . A tiny door towards the bottom of the craft began to open . It was behind us now over the street and I was staring out the back window . As the tiny door on the craft opened I saw a very very bright white light . I screamed louder and my dad I think got scared so he began to speed off and as I watched out the back window I saw the craft float off over some trees . We never saw the object after we searched through the skies again . I know that all sounds crazy...but it is the truth...and people seem to not believe when I tell the story...my mom has her doubts I think .

2 Black Disc shaped ufo's fly overhead incredible speed.;2014-07-09 14:00:00;1 second;2 Black Disc shaped ufo's fly overhead incredible speed. Hello,  I caught two UFO's on the video that I attached.  The UFO's were recorded flying overhead in Easley.  They are obviously no known bird or bug species, they made no sound, and made no vibration to the camera as they flew over.  The recorded video is originally around 24 minutes, but I shortened it down because these were the only UFO's that I saw in the video.  I would appreciate any feedback or information on what these objects are.   Thank you for your time.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJLjDjQEFHA   I have numerous other video's of ufo's recorded in Simpsonville S.C.  I have screencasted some of them in order to point out the ufo's on video.  I captured a Cigar shaped ufo for over 8 minutes with smaller ufo's surrounding it.  http://youtu.be/9MZ2Hx2crzo   Thank you for your time,  I look forward to hearing back from you.  Thank you.     ;34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
Floating, hovering object in sky that ascended and eventually disappeared.;2017-10-04 20:00:00;3 minutes;Floating, hovering object in sky that ascended and eventually disappeared. As my family and I were returning home from dinner, I observed an object in the sky with lights around the edge of the object, giving it a disk like appearance.  I was heading SW on Three Bridges Rd, in a rural area between the cities of Greenville and Anderson, South Carolina.   I first saw the object through a clearing of trees that line the road, directly in front of me.  It appeared to be at least a couple of miles away, maybe 500-1000 ft in the air.  There was an airplane that passed by in the vicinity, but this object was stationary, almost like it may have been hovering.  I tracked it with my eyes as much as I safely could while driving to see if it moved at all.   Having grown up bird and duck hunting, I used trees and other objects in the sky to try and triangulate the location as best as possible.  The object wasn’t moving. I then approached an area that is heavily wooded and blocked the line of sight I had on the object.   When I came out of the area, I saw the object in the same location, then all of  a sudden, it quickly ascended in the sky to the point it disappeared.   During the duration of the time I saw the object, I had feeling or sense like I was being watched by something or someone.;34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
Saucer shaped object with 3 white lights in triangular pattern on the bottom. Seen by one person and her puppy;2020-05-02 22:20:00;3 minutes;Saucer shaped object with 3 white lights in triangular pattern on the bottom. Seen by one person and her puppy The environment where my sighting took place was in a suburban type of neighborhood. I took my puppy to the front yard on his leash to go to potty around 10:15. After about 5 minutes passed, which I can only guess because I did not have my phone at the time, of us walking in the front yard I noticed two bright white lights in the sky about 300ft in front of the house with what looked like a spotlight on top of the object pointed into the clouds. The object was directly over the neighborhood approximately 50ft above the ground, it was so close to the roof of my two story house, after a few seconds and I could see more clearly that it actually had 3 lights on the bottom and had a very obvious saucer silhouette.  The object continued to pass over my house and the neighborhood in a matter of a minute. It was only in my eyesight for 3 minutes before the trees in the distance obscured my view.  I think it’s also worth adding the object made a very low hum that felt like a vibration or possibly an engine hum. Another thing to note is that my puppy is a dog that barks viciously at aircrafts flying over him like helicopters or military aircrafts, in my area it is not uncommon to see military flights, even with the unidentified aircraft so close to him he was incredibly calm and didn’t move a muscle. The very last detail is that there were 3 people inside the house awake at the time of my encounter and not one person inside heard the noise.;34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
