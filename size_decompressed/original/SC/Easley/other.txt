Hockey-puck-shaped-thing.;1991-10-01 14:45:00;fifteen minutes;Hockey-puck-shaped-thing. This was about ten years ago, I was a fifth grader.  My mom picked me up from school one day and as we were driving home, I noticed a black object hovering in the sky.  At first I thought it might be a balloon, but as we pulled into our driveway, it looked more like a hockey-puck turned on its side.  It was maybe 200 feet above the ground (without knowing its actual size, it's hard to know exactly how high it was) and was spinning counter-clockwise relatively to the ground at maybe 45 rpm.  I can't remember what day it was, but I can remember what it looked like exactly.  It was black, not entirely shiny, but not flat, either.  After about fifteen minutes, it finally began ascending.

Vshape object during Daylight hours spotted.;2010-08-25 17:30:00;30 seconds;Vshape object during Daylight hours spotted. UFO Spotted on August 25, 2010 in the upstate of South Carolina  Tuesday evening around 5:30 pm I was standing out side my home talking with a friend when over his shoulder off in the distance I saw what I though was a flock of birds coming straight toward us because of the shape but it was very strange as I could see air disturbance like heat waves or a mirage and I also started to think my eyes was playing tricks on me but I realized what ever it was it was moving very fast coming straight toward us and as it got closer I could make out it was V-shape and a fairly large object  that was almost transparent and there was large round spots on each wing and when it got right over the top of us it made a hard right turn and quickly disappeared. This object was moving very fast and the right turn it made would be impossible for any aircraft that we know of today, and the color almost matched the color of the sky, there was no noise but the air around it looked like it was a mirage. I have seen some of the TV shows where People have seen V-shape objects at night but never any in daylight, the round circles on the wings could be lights but they were not on. This is very strange but I know what I saw and have not been able to get it off of my mind, this is actually the third UFO sighting for me but the only one I have put down in writing, I would like to know if anyone else has seen and object like this in the daytime.;34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
