I spotted what I thought was a falling star at first but just before going behind the tree line it made a left turn without changing speed or shape and seemed to slow a bit as it moved across the sky parallel to the ground in a northwest direction (toward Pickens). My husband and I watched it until went out of sight, beyond a house up the hill further up the street. It wasn't a light but more like a glow that you would associate with a fire ember. It was perfectly round. I couldn't tell the size or distance because it never went below a tree line or behind a power pole, etc so I didnt have a reference. I recall this being the spookiest Halloweens I ever experienced.;34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
8 Red/Orange spheres flying slow and very low at night.;2019-04-12 21:00:00;20 minutes;8 Red/Orange spheres flying slow and very low at night. The objects are sphere like and are orange or red in color.  They fly low and slow, sometimes seeming to just stop and hover, before fading out to nothing.  You cannot hear any noise at all, like with a plane or helicopter flying over.  While staring at them closely they appear to have bursts of the same color light around them.  They are solid red or orange and do not blink at all.  I saw 8 tonight, first two, then 2 more, then 3, then one.  No more than 3 were in sight at one time.  I have seen them before about 6 months ago.  At that time it was only 3 and they all hovered in one spot for over 10 minutes in a triangle pattern, then just faded out to nothing.  I have never really believed in UFO'S, but I really like to know what these are!;34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
