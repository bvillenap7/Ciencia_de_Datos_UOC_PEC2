I always look at the stars and admire them on a clear night. This particular night I saw a bright light, the only colors I distinctly remember are red and yellow. The thing was so high up, I could not distinguish a shape.   My 1st thought was probably the space lab, or a satellelite, but it was not moving.  I stared at it for a long time, the lights seemed to flash or twinkle.  I was awestruck, not frightened, but curious what it could be.  Suddenly, it moved very fast, up and left.  Then just as suddenly back into place.  It had moved a few inches from my perspective, which I know had been many miles actually.  It stayed in place several more minutes, then disappeared.  It didn't move away, it just vanished. I have been curious if anyone else in my area saw it.;34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
