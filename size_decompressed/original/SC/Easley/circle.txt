Very bright white light, alarming speed and a change of direction.;2008-01-27 23:46:00;6-8 seconds;Very bright white light, alarming speed and a change of direction. At 23:46 PM EST in Easley, SC I was located on the back deck facing the skies that Ursa Minor reside on the horizon and noticed a round, very bright light(I cannot state it as a craft) fly overhead closer than most planes that come out of the local airport fly by. It proceeded at a very alarming speed to the horizon, paused for not but a second and changed direction heading NW I believe. It was very agile in that its speed and turn were impeccable. The object appeared to move over miles easily, I've not seen any shooting stars or meteors in my time to stay on an even level as if it were in flight. The Light was very quiet and the event couldn't have lasted for more than 6-8 secs.  I have heard rumors of a satellite that should be coming down and also of various fragments entering our atmosphere. The level of speed was simply astonishing and the way it changed direction was what made me contact you. I hope for my sake someone else reports seeing this. I left my contact info on your machine.  Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));34.8045911564627;-82.5830275510203
