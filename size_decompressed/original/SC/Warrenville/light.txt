I was smoking a cigarette outside at about 9:20 pm, when I noticed a star was moving, and getting brighter and brighter.  It zigzagged a bit, then spiraled down in a funnel and disappeared.  It looked like it crashed into another dimension.  Then just a couple of seconds later, another unidentified object came flying across the the sky from right to left, going south southwest I think.   I watched this second light for about 1-2 minutes, before just disappearing.  I was shocked, and in awe at the same time.   I haven't seen anything like that since I was a little girl, don't know what it was exactly, but it was not a shooting star, or an airplane.;33.5229;-81.7983
