It was late (around 1:30 am) and we were driving along Beech Island Ave. we both saw the light at the same time - it was way up in the sky and far away from us - the fireball was lime green on the bottom and hot pink on the top - it fell straight down (not at an angle) and just seemed to appear out of nowhere - the fireball left a small tail behind it - almost looked like a firework (expect it was def NOT a firework)... It disappeared as quickly as it appeared - it fell for approx 10 seconds - very pretty, but very strange ... We both couldn't believe that we saw it!! It wasn't really a perfect sphere and looked as though it may have been sort of shaped like a child's spinning top (but the top portion was thicker than that of a top). Hope this makes sense!;33.474;-81.8626
