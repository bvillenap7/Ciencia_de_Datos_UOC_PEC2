Two vertical lines of 3 lights apiece, hovering.;2011-10-13 20:00:00;5 minutes;Two vertical lines of 3 lights apiece, hovering. A friend and I were driving over a hill at night and could see a vertical line of 3 lights in the distance. They almost looked like tower lights but they were orange and far too high in the sky.  We commented on the oddness and decided to take a darker back road to see what the lights were. When we turned off the main road and drove out of a tree set, we could see there were two lines of 3 lights, both vertical and orange. I pulled off the road and we got out of the car to watch them.  They were not moving and there was no sound.  They were far above the horizon and were obviously not connected to anything from the ground.  There were no other colors other than a bright orange and they did not flash or blink. We watched as the left hand set of lights seemed to move a little to the left and then the bottom of the left hand lights started to move a little away from the line and faded.  One by one they faded out.  It could have been cloud cover as the night was very cloudy.  But after the fading they were gone.   It was an interesting sight and I was hoping someone might have seen it and reported it to local news so that we might get an explanation but nothing seemed to be in our news.;35.046;-81.9809999999998
