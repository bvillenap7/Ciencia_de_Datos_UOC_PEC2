We saw 3 red lights hovering over our neighborhood.  They seemed to be just floating or hovering.  My neighbor, or former firefighter, was very startled and kept asking, What is that?  I said, it looks like large Japanese lanterns or maybe drones.  He said, It's not drones.   In about 3 minutes, they flew upward and off together in formation into the distance (northeast toward Chesnee, SC) and out of sight.  We heard no sound.  I couldn't see if it was 1 object with 3 lights or 3 separate objects.;35.046;-81.9809999999998
