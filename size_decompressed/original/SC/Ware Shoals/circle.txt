Large UFO flies within 50 feet of surprised bystander.;1975-11-01 23:00:00;5-10 minutes;Large UFO flies within 50 feet of surprised bystander. This is an old report. Sorry, but at the time there weren't any reporting agencies. I actually stood within 50 feet of a flying UFO that was only 30 feet in the air. It made no sound.  There was no wind. The stars were out and what I saw was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life.  It was round, but had a magnificent display of lights that seems to rotate around the circumference of the disk like object.  There appeared to be a dark hole in the center and the disk was probably only about 300 ft. in diameter.   I thought I saw windows at the top, as it made its way around the old cotton mill.  That part of the building was only about 25 ft. high.  But, the UFO was near the top of the building's outer edge.  I was looking at it from an angle.  I was standing on a walk way that led to the street that was between me and a parking lot.  The UFO passed over the street lights of the parking lot very slowly.  It appeared to be moving about 20 miles an hour.  I and a friend of mine watched it as it slowly made its way up river towards Greenville, SC. The time seemed to stand still.
