The craft was moving from the east to north at a moderate speed and had appeared to fly with an altitude equivalent to that of military craft or a low orbit satellite.  The object soon after began to slow, practically to a complete stop, at which time the object became much brighter while still maintaining its altitude. The craft's light then faded and the object appeared to rapidly ascend at a sharp angle into space or the upper atmosphere.  It should also be noted that both military and commercial aircraft are common in the vicinity in which this craft was spotted. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  Date is approximatel.
