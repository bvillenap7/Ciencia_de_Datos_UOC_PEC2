Fireball over sc;2011-12-31 21:00:00;5-10 sec;fireball over sc I was sitting on my porch smoking a ciggarete.  I was looking down when i realized the porch lit up a little enough for me to look up to see what looked like a comet or fireball the size of a dime from where i was.  It moved from east to west for about 5-10 seconds.  As it was moving it looked like it changed colors from red to a sort of green.  There also looked to be flames falling from it.  There was no noise and then dissapeard.  I tried to look on the local news stations and the internet to see if anyone else saw it too.  I believe our local news station posted on thier website that someone reported the same thing some miles away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.0405;-81.8175
