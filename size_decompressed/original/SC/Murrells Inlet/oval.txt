Ufo and Uso in same frame video recorded.;2011-07-05 23:00:00;30 mins;Ufo and Uso in same frame video recorded. It was a family vacation to South Carolina Murrells inlet.  On June 5Th 2011 at 23:00 hours we witnessed activity over the ocean from our beach front 3rd story condo. My father in law brought it to my attention, how these lights would get into formation of a triangle and disappear. This went on for 30 mins. They would go away and show up seconds later miles apart from were we saw them. I saw a burning red color and as it streaked away it left a red trail behind it. That prompted me to get my video camera.  After about 15 mins of waiting the objects appeared again this time right in front of our condo. I got at least 20 secs of the oval shaped craft with lights fixed around it. I zoomed in for a better view and they vanished as quick as they came.  After watching the video i discovered another craft spinning on a slant heading right into the ocean.  After that the other one took off upwards.. The lights were luminous and strange.  Not like lights I have ever seen!  The video is with a dark background being over the ocean at night.  Nothing much to compare size to.  However the crafts are Highly visible on camera.

I went outside to feed my dog when something caught my eye in the sky.  I looked up and saw what I thought was a low flying plane but then really looking I saw 3 separate crafts with red blinking lights going out from the center to the ends then turned white and then started all over again continueously.  They were moving a little slower than a normal small plane.  As I was watching them the last one just disappeared, then the middle and then first.;33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998
