Military plane the size of 2 boeing 787 with 3 cylindrical tubes the middle being twice as long as side tubes and laced on the sides and bottom with lights.   The aircraft (I'd say airship from size) was below the low hanging clouds giving me a great video,  the closest thing in comparison I'd say was a super sized SR71 Blackbird.;33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998
