THE AIR WAS PLEASANTLY DRY AND VISABLITY WAS UN-LIMITED.  AS I WAS SITTING ALONE ON THE WATER WAY,I WAS LOOKING  AT THE SKY,AND THE STARS. AS I WAS LOOKING FOR A SHOOTING STAR,I NOTICED TWO OBJECTS MOVING VERY HIGH,AND VERY FAST ACROSS THE SKY.SINCE I HAD UNLIMITED VISABILITY ,I WAS ABLE TO SEE THESE OBJECTS AS THEY APPEARED TO TRAVEL AT A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE ,AT A GREAT  SPEED.  AS I WATCHED THESE OBJECTS,I NOTICED AS THEY APPEARED TO GO NORTH,AND THEN ABRUPTLY  TURNED DIRECTION,AND  WENT IN AN ALMOST REVERSED DIRECTION.ALTHOUGH THERE APPEARED TO BE NO NOISE AND NO BLINKING LIGHTS,I DID NOTICE THAT THEY WERE VERY BRIGHT IN  A WHITE LIGHT AS I SAT THERE WATCHING THESE OBJECTS ,I WAS AMAZED THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING BOTH VERY FAST ,AND VERY SILENT ,BUT  MOVED IN FORMATION   LIKE DIRECTIONS.  I WATCHED THEM AS THEY APPEARED TO BE  PRECISE IN DIRECTION AND MOVEMENT, . AFTER APPROX.FORTY MINUTES THESE OBJECTS, WENT  NORTHWARD AND THEN SEEMED TO GO OUT OF SIGHT BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE THEY WERE AWAY FROM ME.

I thought to m;2015-08-29 20:00:00;30 seconds;I was driving on Hwy 707, headed toward Socastee, when I saw 2 VERY bright headlight beams flying VERY low in the skyline.  I thought to myself that it might crash into a cellphone tower as it flew toward Surfside Beach/Garden City area.  Hwy 707 is quite curvy and lined with trees.   The lights were very large, very bright, side by side.  I could not see the aircraft because the 2 lights were intensely bright.  I could see the approaching headlights through the trees next to the road,   I tried to keep an eye on the aircraft as it crossed over hey 707 above or just behind me thru my rear view mirror.  I was unable to do so because of the curvy road and I could not find an area to pull over to get a better view to observe more detail of the craft and I then lost sight of the craft.  I could not hear any sounds coming from the aircraft.  No engine noise, but it was flying slowly and very, very low.;33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998
