First pulses of light brought object to our attention.  Three pulses of dim yellow light that grew rapidly in intensity, dimmed rapidly then reappeared very close to the preceeding pulse within a half second before the first light had dimmed fully like 3 lights from the same object just happening at different intervals. Same three pulses happened further down the coast within 15 seconds and further out to sea, estimate distance travelled in the 15 seconds was 5 miles.  That was the last sighting.  All who viewed the lights were around 45 to 50.  The reason for the report is the pulses of light were unusual and everyone noticed how unusual they were.
