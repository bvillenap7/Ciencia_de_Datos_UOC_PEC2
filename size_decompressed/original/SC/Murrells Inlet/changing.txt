We were sitting In the creek. I looked over to the inlet about a half a mile away.  I saw seven lights standing vertical and moving to the left . It was very strange.  I pointed it out to my friends and had originally thought it was a very odd plain. The lights were a yellow orange bright bright glowing color.  They then shut off completely. I decided to start filming at this point.  The lights came back on up over garden city s.c in front of the Gulf stream cafe for the locals. There were two initially very close almost attached, one light went out and one flickered out shortly after.  The lights then dissapeared and popped up far away.  They then shot back over the original location. 1 light came on and the second then off.  It then lite up 1 light all the way up to about 8 -10 lights and looked to have spun to the right in a circle.  On my large tv it looks amazing. After rotating the lights got smal! ler and formed a straight line of smaller lights and was gone . Search you tube video under ( Myrtle beach UFO 9/13/12 );33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998
