Triangle Lights over BrookGreen Gardens.;2013-09-24 20:30:00;3-4 minutes;Triangle Lights over BrookGreen Gardens Driving US Hwy 17 South near Brook Green Gardens at about 8:30 PM on September 24, 2013.  My 3 year old started shouting Daddy - look at the Helicopter.  I saw what appreared to be a very bright star in the Southern sky.  The Star became brighter and began to get closer.  As we drove south down 17, the traffic began to slow considerably (from 60 to about 30) as people noticed this light.  As it approached, I made out 3 distinct white lights in the shape of a triangle.  There were no strobe lights and no Red or Green Navigation lights visible  (as would be required on any civil aircraft).  The object slowly moved over the highway at about 500' and then drifted, slowly, to the west, out over Brookgreen Gardens.;33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998
5 Yellowish craft overflew Murrells Inlet this evening.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from former USN fighter pilot.  PD));2014-06-20 21:35:00;2 minutes;5 Yellowish craft overflew Murrells Inlet this evening At approximately 9:35 this evening I observed 4 glowing objects coming from S, moving N/NE, traveling at between 70-200-mph at about 600-800 feet in altitude and climbing over Murrells Inlet South Carolina.  (Highway 707 at around Tournament Blvd.   The objects were flying in pairs of two.  They appeared to be parasails with lights around them, but they were moving too fast and climbing too fast to be a parachute.  They were arc shaped and looked to be 40-50 across.  When I first observed they were slow, then within a matter of 15 seconds sped up and flew into a cloud later at a high rate of speed.  There was no sound associated with these objects.  Zero sound.   I thought they were flares initially but I’ve never seen flares slow down, speed up and accelerate as these did.   The lights associated with these craft was a yellowish haze with stronger lights in the center trailing edge. No blinking lights observed.   This is one of the strangest sightings I have ever seen.  I am a pilot and flew military aircraft in the 70’s.  I also fly radio control aircraft and sailplanes.   This occurrence does not match up with anything I’ve ever seen.   One other identical craft over-flew about 30 seconds after the first 4 craft flew over. Total of 5 craft. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, shortly after his sighting, and we found him to be quite eloquent and sober-minded, in his description of the event.  We suspect that he is a superlative witness.  PD));33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998
Three lighted triangles glide quietly over Murrells Inlet toward Myrtle Beach, SC.;2015-01-20 21:00:00;7-8 minutes;Three Lighted Triangles Glide Quietly over Murrells Inlet Toward Myrtle Beach, SC On Tuesday evening, Jan. 20th, 2015 at 9 PM, I walked out front to run an errand, and noticed movement coming from the southwest sky there were 3 sets of lights approaching very slowly.  At first I thought they might be military planes in close formation but as they got closer I realized there was absolutely no sound and they were traveling - more like gliding - much slower than conventional aircraft.  The weather was perfectly clear and the night seemed remarkably quiet. After about 1 minute, the formation passed directly over my driveway at an estimated altitude of 250 feet and each craft appeared to be the same size or a little larger than the wingspan of small private planes at that height. I observed 3 dark triangle-shaped objects with red nose lights and smaller green & white lights on the side points.  The shape of the objects was like a flattened triangle or boomerang as the distance between the green/white lights was very wide and approx. twice the span from the front to side.  The red lights seemed unusually large and remained constant the green & white lights blinked alternately.   I could not make out any detail on the bottom of the craft. I ran into the house and grabbed my primitive camera phone, but could not capture anything but dark night sky.  I watched the formation move off to the northeast, then jumped in my car and followed it for another 4-5 minutes until it eventually went out of view over Myrtle Beach.   It seemed to be following along the Highway 17 Bypass, and maintained the same steady speed for the entire sighting, which lasted 7-8 minutes.;33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998
