Orange lights in the sky hover over the SC coast near Myrtle Beach.;2008-10-16 23:00:00;5-7 mins;Orange lights in the sky hover over the SC coast near Myrtle Beach. Leaving work in Murrells Inlet, SC (just south of Myrtle Beach) I witnessed an orange sphere in an otherwise clear nighttime sky out over the Atlantic Ocean.  It moved slowly left and right, disappeared, reappeared in a different position and was then joined by two additional orange lights.  The lights did not disappear and reappear behind clouds because their were no clouds.  Though it was humid and hazy I could make out stars in the sky.   All three dissappeared and I waited to see if they would reappear and they did not.;33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998

I happened to look towards the East ( the lights appeared to be in the direction of Surfside Beach and Garden City beaches ) and noticed 6 to 7 glowing balls hovering in the sky.  It happened so quickly.  I passed a wooded area that obstructed my view for about a minute.  I then pulled into my neighborhood literally a minute or less later and looked back towards the direction of where I saw these glowing objects.  They were gone.;33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998
