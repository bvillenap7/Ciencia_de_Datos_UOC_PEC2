Three orangish Red balls of light were observed hovering over the ocean, motionless, for 15 minutes.;2007-06-15 22:00:00;15 minutes;Three orangish Red balls of light were observed hovering over the ocean, motionless, for 15 minutes. One night around 10 p.m. in June of 2007 I was relaxing on the beach with two adult friends.  We noticed three orange red balls of light hovering about 100 feet over the ocean about five hundred yards off the shore.  They were at equal distances from each other and remained in this formation for approx. 15 minutes!  (At arms length, the width of your hand apart.)  The balls of light had the color of intense fire but no movement. No sound. They never changed position or tracked any course.  They just held there over the ocean for about fifteen minutes and then just adruptly went off. It was dark, partly cloudy,about 80 degrees. Our vantage point was from a reclined position on the beach, facing N.E.  We were able to watch them very closely with an unobstructed view. This occurred near Murrells Inlet South Carolina.  I only wish to submit this as an affirmation to the validity of these new reports of  fireballs in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

15-20 orange/reddish orbs, moving in a similar pattern, heading south, then disappearing.;2012-11-10 20:30:00;5 minutes;15-20 orange/reddish orbs, moving in a similar pattern, heading south, then disappearing. 15 - 20 orange/reddish orb type lights floating south then disappearing and reappearing.  There was no sound whatsoever.  Smaller orbs were breaking off some of the larger orbs.  They were all moving in a similar pattern.  Some higher than others.  They were moving together in a line but it was not a perfectly straight line.   Later that night, I do not know if the lights were related, but there was a green falling flash that came out of an empty sky.  The green ligh happened around 3am.;33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998

The hour of incident may not be accurate but between the hours of 9:30 & 10:30 pm on 23June14 I was on patrol in a Murrels Inlet resort;2014-06-23 23:30:00;5-7 minutes;The hour of incident may not be accurate but between the hours of 9:30 & 10:30 pm on 23June14, I was on patrol in a Murrels Inlet resort (which will remain anonymous) and was watching over the horizon of the ocean and spotted a red light which glowed into view, remained lit, then faded out.  I saw this occurrence happen again and asked a guest in the pool area where I was standing to look over the direction I was pointing.  I told him what I saw but he said he saw nothing.  This object remained in a constant position over the horizon.   On my next glance, I saw the light glow red and appear to split off to the left in the northern direction.  The red glowing light never came back into view.   My first thought was a meteor but the duration of the constant light, the lack of movement from its location, and the sudden departure from view, made me question that.  I saw no other reports of this, but would like it documented.;33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998
Two bright white lights hovered over the ocean, then became blinking lights as it flew out over the ocean.;2020-08-20 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;Two bright white lights hovered over the ocean, then became blinking lights as it flew out over the ocean. We saw 2 equal distant horizontal random blinking lights high in the sky. At first we thought they were 2 planes but they stayed the same distance apart and, unlike planes that you can always see a solid light in addition to the blinking wing lights, these were completely dark in between the flashes. There was also no sound (we heard planes flying over many times that were that high in the sky and you could hear their engines). We watched it come from west to east across the sky and then it stopped over the ocean. The 2 blinking lights became solid, bright white/yellow lights and it hovered silently over the ocean for a minute. The lights were horizontal to the ocean, seemingly looking toward the beach. Then the solid lights went out and the blinking lights started again and it flew out over the ocean toward the horizon. Minutes later we saw 6-8 more blinking lights out on the horizon far away, moving south slowly (left to right) before they just disappeared one at a time.;33.5461999999999;-79.0427999999998
