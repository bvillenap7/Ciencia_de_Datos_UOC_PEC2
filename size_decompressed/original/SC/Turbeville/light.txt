It was dark outside as we had no lights.  The glow was lighting up the yard.  I went and got a bunch of people.  At the time I was 13 so everyone said to go to your room and go to bed.  That light just glowed there for about 30 minutes until it faded.  It also had a mist around the glow.  It was about  20' X 20' and very bright.
