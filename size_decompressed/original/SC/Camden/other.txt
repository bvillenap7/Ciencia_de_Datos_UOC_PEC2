The  largest fastest moving object that I have ever seen and never heard.;1996-02-15 16:00:00;5 minutes;The  largest fastest moving object that I have ever seen and never heard. My wife at the time were driving down a road at night and noticed this big bright light way up in the sky. THe lights looked like there were about 7 huge spotlights pointing down. Then it started to move slowly down towards us. My wife was getting scared and I couldnt believe what we were seeing. This light was so bright it felt warm when I got out of the car. Then it came to a stop about 500 above us. You couldnt see exactly the shape because it was to bright to fully look at it. I would say it was bigger than a 747 but there were no wings as far as we could tell and there were no blinking lights. This is what surprised us the most is that this thing had no noise dead silence. Then all of a sudden it took off. It went from just sitting there to gone and I could see it leaving in the distance. I have seen F-16s and other fighter jets and they could not touch this. This thing did turn off his lights right before he left. THere still was no noise of it even when it took off. This object was just gone. My wife and I said to each other right there that we would never speak of this because nobody would ever believe what we just saw. Well this is the first time I have ever spoke of it to anyone.;34.267;-80.5913
