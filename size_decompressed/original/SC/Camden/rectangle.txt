Orange rectangular sunset facing east;2014-05-14 20:45:00;1-3 minutes;Orange rectangular sunset facing east I don't think it was a craft persae, but it was orange like a sunset and rectangular.  It couldn't have been the sun setting because we were traveling east.   It was hovering over the tree line at the horse track.   When we got to the stop light to turn onto 521 it was gone.   The trees were mostly tall, dark pines, abd it was partly cloudy.;34.267;-80.5913
