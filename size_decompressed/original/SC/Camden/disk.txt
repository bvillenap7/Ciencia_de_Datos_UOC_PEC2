Saucer shaped the length of a football field;1985-10-15 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;Saucer shaped the length of a football field I've waited many years to tell my story , so here goes. After a high school football game my mother and I were riding home down dark rural streets. Behind the trees it appeared to be a flying object flying paralell to us at about the same speed ( maybe 30 mph ). When we got to a cross road by our home we stopped , got out of the car, and looked up and was dumbstruck at what we saw. It was a clear open area (the crossroad ) and it was directly overhead, maybe 300 feet in the air ( very low ). From directly underneath it was round with 4 white lights and a red one in the middle. It was probably 75 - 100 yards long. It completely covered all the stars behind it and sat there for maybe 30 seconds hovering above us with NO noise what so ever. It then started moving away from us behind the trees and out of sight. When we got home I immediately called the Camden airport to see if they had anything on radar or knew of anything flying in the area , and they said no. I often wonder if they even had a Radar system. Anyway, I know what I saw, It was nothing I've ever seen in life or on TV . I truly believe it was from a superior intelligence.;34.267;-80.5913
