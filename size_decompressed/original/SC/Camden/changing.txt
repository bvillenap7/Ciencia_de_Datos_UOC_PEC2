3 witnesses and we are not crazy.;2014-07-10 23:00:00;10 minutes;3 witnesses and we are not crazy. My wife's cousin was outside when she yelled we are avid ufo investagators.  I feel the pull sometimes when the ships are close.  The cousin screamed and i ran to the door she was standing on the side porch in rural sc.  As i got to the door, it was approaching fast and stopped about 60 feet away and 80 feet up.  It hovered as clear as day silent as a smooth wind .my wife screams as i have to see what was the commtion.  We watched it watch us for 10minutes solid at least.  I stood dumbfounded and afraid.  Upon the final minute or so it pulls off circlelar in shape with light blue lights rounding the edges with a red light emitting from the bottom. As it left it seemed to grow wings as pass as silently as it pulled up.;34.267;-80.5913
