large with only white lights hovering above the ground from 30-50 seconds;2019-10-16 21:41:00;30-50 seconds;large with only white lights hovering above the ground from 30-50 seconds On October 16th around 9:41 PM my husband and I was leaving Savannah Georgia heading toward South Carolina. As we were going down a dark 2 lane road which is Hwy 17A not far past the Georgia line into Hardeeville South Carolina we noticed from about half a mile away a large object larger than a full moon hovering above the ground. It was close to the ground so much that it could have not been a plane and to quiet to be a jet. As we drove under it the object looked triangular in shape with only bright white lights on it. I stuck my head out the window and there was no sound. From what my husband says it lasted anywhere from 30 to 50 seconds because we saw it from a distance, drove under it and past it. From the picture it looks as if its moving not long after we passed it. The picture was a accidental mirror shot, but you can see it above a car behind us.  We turned around and by the time we got back it was gone. la;32.2628;-81.0647
