Five reddish-orange, round lights that spanned about two miles.;1990-05-21 20:50:00;5 minutes;Five reddish-orange, round lights that spanned about two miles. My girlfriend and I were smoking a cigarette when she said, what is that?  I looked and saw about 5 or 6 reddish-orange lights.  Up in the sky i would estimate the object was 2 miles long.  It moved slow like an aircraft.  We watched for 5 minutes then it disappered or kind of faded.  When I first saw the craft I noticed one light, then three following, then one following that.  There was a plane that crossed behind it and I know it had to of seen what I saw, only closer.;34.723861038961;-82.938977922078
