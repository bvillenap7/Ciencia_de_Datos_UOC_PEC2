Driving down country road and noticed 3 white lights in a triangle up ahead.  Thought it was an airplane until it came to a complete stop above us.   Then as we stopped to view it, it picked up speed with ease and continued flying straight ahead, as if it were a car stopping and going again.  It didn't lag at all or shake, it hovered perfectly still.  There was no sound at all.;34.723861038961;-82.938977922078
