My boyfriend and I saw 5 round orange lights in what appeared to be the shape of a large ship.   The first light(at what appeared to be the front of the ship) was approximatley 2 miles from the last light. In the center of the ship were three more lights in the shape of a triangle.  The craft slowly passed over our home, and as it was moving towards the west the three orange lights went out, then a minute or so later the light at the front of the ship went out.  Several minutes later as the craft appeared to go higher in the sky, the light at the end of the ship went out. Before the final light went out, an airplane crossed its direct path.  When I first spotted the ship it appeared to be only a mile or so above where we were standing on my back porch.;34.723861038961;-82.938977922078
