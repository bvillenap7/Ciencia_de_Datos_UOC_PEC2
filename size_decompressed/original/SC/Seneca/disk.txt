I saw a large plane at altitude a guess of 50,000 ft.  The disk either popped through the contrail or out of same came toward me then sharp 90 to its right, my left.  It came up beside the large plane for 1 to 2 seconds then veered away and passed at approx. 45 degree angle and left plane like it was standing still.  I then lost sight of it.  The plane was traveling east to west.;34.723861038961;-82.938977922078
