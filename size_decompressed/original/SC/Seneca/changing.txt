Four dancing lights.;2014-04-29 22:34:00;1+ hour;Four dancing lights. I walked out onto my deck, facing east, around 10pm, April 29, 2014.  The overhead sky was cloudy.  I noticed a light on the bottom of a cloud to my southeast, towards Lake Hartwell.  I called my domestic partner to come look.  I told him to turn the porch light off as he came outside onto the deck.   Then we watched 4 lights, hovering around in the clouds, then they grouped together, then one each flew in each direction, being north, east, west, and south.  They constantly done this and would even fly in random patterns at times.   I came back inside, and went back on the deck approximately 30 minutes later, and they were still doing as before.;34.723861038961;-82.938977922078
