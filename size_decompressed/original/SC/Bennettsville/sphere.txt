A friend and myself were in his backyard training in his wrestling ring. After about an hour and a half of bumping around I laid down to rest, Looked straight up in a clear blue sky and saw a metallic sphere directly above us. I'm like what the hell is that! It's not moving and it was as bright as a star at night but it was 4:40 pm . This thing was way up there because we saw two airliners I know for sure and it was way higher. after a 10 minutes of watching we saw a smaller sphere or orb, It looked the same but smaller also metallic. The smaller object then vanished or desolved,That's the way it looked anyway.But soon after I would say 5 minutes the larger sphere began to move slowly away. niether object did any quick u-turns or fast zig zags. Just a slow ,very slow silent parting. These objects looked to me like the one's caught on film in Mexico.;34.627;-79.6893
