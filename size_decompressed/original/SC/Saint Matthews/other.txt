Unknown craft flying towards the eastern hoizon.;2014-03-08 15:30:00;~10 seconds;Unknown craft flying towards the eastern hoizon. While I was taking a picture of a passenger jet that was a high in the air (going from my right towards my left or East to West) I noticed a small speck/flash (reflection) of white against the sky, which I thought was another airplane.   As I got my camera focused and zoomed in on the object it did not appear to be a regular airplane, it looked more tubular with no visible wings like an airplane would have and it was white in color.  I was able to take 2 pictures of it before it left my sight.    The object was flying initially a more North to South direction then it turned East towards the horizon.   After downloading the pictures I noticed that it did not have any features of a regular airplane or helicopter and I could not identify it.;33.6973;-80.8654
