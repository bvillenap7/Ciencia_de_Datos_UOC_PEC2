Pulled over to view the aircraft. Aircraft had multiple white spot lights pointed on the ground. Heard what sounded like jet engines rather than helicopter rotors, but the aircraft was hovering in place for minutes. Had to leave the scene due to traffic. Aircraft never moved before losing sight in my rearview mirror.;33.6178;-81.059
