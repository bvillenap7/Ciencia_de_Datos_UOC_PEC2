Bright object seen in Gaffney, SC.;2017-05-28 03:45:00;30 minutes;Bright object seen in Gaffney, SC. My daughter and I were traveling North on Interstate 85 and saw a large bright object to our east.  The object stayed stationary for approximately 20 minutes.   At first we thought it might be a huge star or planet, but my daughter used her sky map to see what would be in that location and there was no planet or large star mapped in that location.   The object then appeared to dim and go out.  Hownever, 5 minutes later, the object reappeared and was just as bright.  It then moved left and then right and appeared to separate and the join back together.   After about 10 more minutes the object disappeared again.;35.0808099476441;-81.6743764397904
