Craft vanishes into thin air.;2013-06-15 05:45:00;5 minutes;Craft vanishes into thin air. Craft was very high altitude, seemed to be stationary.  White or silver in color, at that time of morning, the sun was just up, and you could tell the sunlight was reflected on one side of the craft.  About 10 times as long as it was wide, angled in the sky like a backslash ( / ).   Myself and other witness observed it for about 5 minutes, never wanting to say the words UFO.  We ruled out all possibilities, then the craft started slowly rotating, so that we where seeing one end of it.  Once it got to this position, it simply vanished.  Did not take off, or move at all, it simply vanished instantly.;35.0808099476441;-81.6743764397904
