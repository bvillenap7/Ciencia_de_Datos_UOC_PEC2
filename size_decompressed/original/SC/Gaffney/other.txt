Gaffney, SC, Report. Bright Light With Sparks;2004-02-24 21:00:00;5 minutes;Gaffney SC Report. Bright Light With Sparks Time was 8:30-9:30pm not sure as we just arrived home from shopping in Shelby NC. I was standing at the edge of my property looking at what I thought was Venus. It was stationary for some time but, started moving. It appeared to start moving very slowly and appeared as just a large star. As it moved closer it emitted large sparks. I would estimate it about the size of a car. I couldn't make out any distinguishing features only that it was a yellowish/white color light ball.  It was about 50ft high in the air and wobbled back and forth a bit.  At first glance I thought it was a helicopter with problems but, as it became closer it was apparent it was not such a craft because it had no noise nor as big as a helicopter. It sped up by the time it reached the other side of the property and made a directional turn northwards. The sparking was occasional and rained down on the trees below. My parents were also witnesses to this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));35.0808099476441;-81.6743764397904
