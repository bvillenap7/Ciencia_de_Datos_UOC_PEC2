They were perferctally aligned one on top, the other on the bottom but space inbetween them, no movement at all, just two very bright lights that looked like stars, but were bigger than stars.  The top light then started to flicker and just disappeared, then about 15 secs later the bottom light flickered out and disappreaed as well.  I drive this route everyday and never seen anything like this, I have no clue what I saw.;35.0808099476441;-81.6743764397904
