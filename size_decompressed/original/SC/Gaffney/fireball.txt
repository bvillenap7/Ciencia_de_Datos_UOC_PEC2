Fireball seen in South Carolina;2004-06-05 20:00:00;1 minute;Fireball seen in South Carolina Walking across the lawn to my brother's I was looking at the this yellowish fireball which looked to be sparkling and thinking it's early for them to be shooting fireworks but the object did not move and I told my dad, hey dad look at this he walked up and exclaimed What the hell is that I start yelling for mom to get her video camera and she came out and watched and the object started moving very slowly towards interstate 85 appearing as if it was moving north and when it crept approximately a mile past my house it shot off very quickly like a steak of light North. Mom was confused by us yelling to get video camera and never did go get this to capture it on film.;35.0808099476441;-81.6743764397904
