Two points of light chased by helicopters over Lake Greenwood, South Carolina;2002-11-02 20:45:00;10 seconds;Two points of light chased by helicopters over Lake Greenwood, South Carolina A group of approximately 10 people were on my back deck watching a football game and socializing when I started hearing a faint mechanical noise. At first I thought it was a train (there is a track approximately 1/4 mile from my house). After about thirty seconds it became clear that it was a helicopter. I thought at the time that it was quite strange for two reasons: first, I don't remember seeing any helicopters at the lake before, and two, it was dark. A friend and I ran down my steps and into the clearing near the water. We then saw that there were two helicopters flying very low and fairly fast. There was enough ambient light that we could clearly see the silhouettes of the helicopters. It was several seconds before I noticed that they appeared to be chasing two points of light that were traveling equally as low and fast, staying about 750 feet in front of the helicopters. They were moving independent of each other and the helicopters, but there was no silhouette of any kind associated with the two objects that I would estimate as being 3-5 feet in diameter. My friend works as a project engineer for a contractor. I am 37, working on my pilot's license, have some college, run my families' business, own a small business, am elected to a minor local office and have a 16 year old son that lives with me.;34.3369;-82.0867

An aircraft with blinking lights approached the light and circled its last position just as the big light went out.  I am not sure what the bright object was.  Just reporting a weird sighting.

Bright white stationary light in the sky during space station sighting.;2019-10-10 20:05:00;2 seconds;Bright white stationary light in the sky during space station sighting. During an ISS sighting of 10th October, at 20:00, ISS passing from NNW to East.  Myself and my wife observed a bright white light to the south at an elevation of 30 degrees after the ISS had passed by.  Looked like a spotlight being turned on then off. I originally thought that the light was aircraft landing lights as we are under several busy air corridors. Continued observation of the sky in that area revealed no aircraft, also thought it could be a satellite but continued observation along the projected path revealed no further sighting.;34.3369;-82.0867
