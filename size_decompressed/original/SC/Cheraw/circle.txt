The sound was so loud a stray cat that wonders the parking lot took off running . I grabbed my ears and held my head down and when I looked up I seen a HUGE white ball falling out of the sky.  As it was falling I noticed it was being flipped like a quarter so I seen the white light underside then I seen a black outline.
