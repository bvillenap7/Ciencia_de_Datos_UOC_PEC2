I was just leaving my after school job in October of 71.It was around 8 PM and as I approached a stop sign at an intersection,I saw some bright lights coming towards me.The lights were just above some high voltage power lines.I assumed it was a helicopter checking the lines, but when it got in front of me it made a right turn and went down behind some trees.I went straight across the intersection and toward the place it went down.The object appeared to be hovering just above the pasture.I got out of the car and walked over to the pasture fence.Since it was dark,I couldn't see any shape.The object appeared round or disk shaped due to the circular light pattern.The lights seemed very bright in intensity and were different colors.The object made no sound at all.I stood and stared at the object for a minute or so.I really couldn't believe what I was seeing!I pinched and slapped my face to make sure I wasn't hallucinating.I remembered seeing a house off the road a piece when I stopped,so I thought if I went back to the car and blew the horn, someone would look out and see it also.So I turned toward the car and as I did, the object started slowly moving up and back in the direction from which it came. I jumped in the car and sped back toward the intersection.I almost didn't get stopped and would have collided with a tractor trailer truck.When I looked around all I could see was some blinking lights off in the distance.I headed home and told my parents,only to be laughed at.I told my boss at work the next day and he laughed too.So I just didn't talk too much about it anymore.I know what I saw was real and I was not under the influence of anything.A few years later I found out that I wasn't the only one to see the object.A guy(who is a baptist preacher now),his brother,and mother saw the object just up the road a mile or so from where I saw it.He said his little brother got down in the floor of the car and started praying.He also said his mother went back to the sight almost everyday for 2 weeks.I know it's been! a long time since I saw this,but I still have a vivid memory of it.That's the only time I've ever seen anything like that,but I look to the sky often.Who knows?;35.1062;-81.497
