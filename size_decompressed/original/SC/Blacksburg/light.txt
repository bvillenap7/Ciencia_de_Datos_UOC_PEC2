( we were in a vehicle ) Since I was sitting in the back seat, must younger and much smaller I couldn't follow the shape of the object. All I remembered was seeing red and blue lights ( possibly had green light, I cant remember ) going over the tops of some trees. It was very low, practically touching the tops of the trees. The lights must have been at the back of the craft since the craft was moving forward. The lights were round and didn't seem to be going on and off. I was 15 yrs old then, I am now 41. Looking back over the years this has puzzled me a lot. I dont remember anything after that, I don't even remember going home. And no, I never used drugs. There was a lot of talk going on in the area at that time about ufo's being spotted. I never took any of it serious. I just went along for the ride. My main question is, were there really ufo's in that area that particular time in the 70's?;35.1062;-81.497
