UFO over SRS;2020-08-19 09:30:00;30 seconds;UFO over SRS I saw the object coming straight down from high in the sky.  I made three trails and at the end of the third trail the sunlight reflected off of a shiny silver round object before it went hiding behind a cloud.  The object never went below the cloud and as the cloud got overhead it formed what looked like a giant hula hoop with the trails in the middle of it;33.2301;-81.3511
