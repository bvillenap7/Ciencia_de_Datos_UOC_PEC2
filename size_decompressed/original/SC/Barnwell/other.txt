YEAR: 2010: late summer, Time :about 7:45 - 8:35   I was out side just before sun set when this odd jet like thing flew over me at about 40 mile per hour.  It looked like a air craft on fire with a rope( odd line) going down to a rock shape thing on fire!  I run after it through a few yards and woods! then it flew up in to the sky and was disappearing at the top of the sun set going over 250 miles per hour, right after getting a person 2 house  to look at the sky. By then , it was so far that it was about a dot!  They said the didn't see any thing so I went home about 5 min. before dark would come!  It flew one way most of time other than small turns(I saw it turn right form there) Other area info!  I was about 10 years old when it happen, also alone!   It was a mile from the down town area! PS:  It was near a train track line that closed and rails removed many years before I moved there.  It was dug in like a small valley (deep as a 15 ft. sloping down!  IF you remember this do say!  THANKS! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.2301;-81.3511
