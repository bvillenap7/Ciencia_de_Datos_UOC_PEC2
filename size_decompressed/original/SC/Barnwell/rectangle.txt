Rectangle shaped object in the south sky, followed by two jets.;2008-06-17 23:00:00;3 mins;Rectangle shaped object in the south sky, followed by two jets. On this night, while me and my dad were out on our deck looking toward the south, we noticed what appeared to be a very small cloud next to the moon. Then we watched it moved toward the north and descending. We then noticed that it was rectangle in shape and greenish color as it moved toward the earth.  When it got near the top of the trees it stopped and faded out of sight.  We walked beyond the trees, and noticed high flying aircraft entering the area, then turning and going in the direction of were the craft was last seen. After just a few  minutes, there were no aircraft in the area.;33.2301;-81.3511
