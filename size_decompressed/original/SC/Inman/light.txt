Caught my attention because the object was bright white oval with a glowing almost orange bottom.  No flickering lights or strobe and no noise .  I pulled off side of the road to try and get a video but my iPhone storage was full .  The object moved south parallel to the road  . I turned around and speed down to a point I had good view, the object stopped , for a moment then started an ascent straight up.  It then made a 45 degree vertical ascent and accelerated so fast in  less than a second it just disappeared.    Been in aviation 30 years , this was not an aircraft .   It was a full moon , good visibility .  I saw no plume , no vapor trail or smoke.  It was silent and I saw no other objects in the night sky in the area of said object.;35.0535;-82.0581999999998
