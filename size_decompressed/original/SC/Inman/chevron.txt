Chevrons of lights seen in 4th of July night sky.;2015-07-04 21:30:00;60-90 seconds each;Chevrons of lights seen in 4th of July night sky July 4, 2015, we had a small 4th of July party.  While waiting for a little more darkness to set off our fireworks, we were playing corn hole and watching other fireworks being set off around the area.  Someone noticed a strange, amber light in the sky, seeming to be getting larger.  The light came closer and was a noticeable chevron shape of about 7-9 lights.  A red light or red lit object fell from the chevron.  Not straight down, but first in a curved motion then straight down until it disappeared before reaching the ground.  The chevron continued to move toward us and within a blink disappeared. We were shocked and excited, questioning what we had just saw.  We settled down and went back to corn hole. (by the way, we were also waiting for 2 others to rejoin us for fireworks)  Then the second chevron appeared in the same way as the first except no red lit object and this one turned to the north before disappearing.;35.0535;-82.0581999999998
