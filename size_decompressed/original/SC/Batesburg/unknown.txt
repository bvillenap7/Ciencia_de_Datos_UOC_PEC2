Bright object with an orange tint hovered for 45 minutes.;2002-08-08 22:35:00;45 minutes;Bright object with an orange tint hovered for 45 minutes. I went outside my front door and noticed a brightly lit object with somewhat of an orange tint. The object remained stationary for several minutes and then started moving erratically for a few seconds, then perfectly still again. It repeated this behavior over and over for about 45 minutes, each time it moved it got farther away until we could no longer see it. The erratic movement included quick 90 degree turns, circular patterns and side to side patterns. It moved VERY fast for being as far off as it was (the exact distance I can't be sure of). I am no expert, but it does not take 45 minutes for a plane to pass overhead, and a blimp does not move quickly in any direction. I also had the impression that it was quite large. My wife and her mother also witnessed the object. The object moved off toward Aiken County. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness, who remains anonymous, implies an evening sighting.  We have amended the time to 22:35 hrs.   I believe the witness later contacted us later to report that the object probably was a blimp, but I cannot find the message.  PD));33.8725;-81.5465
