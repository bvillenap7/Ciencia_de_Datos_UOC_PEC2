8 Cigar Shaped Craft;2012-05-21 20:00:00;30 Minutes;8 Cigar Shaped Craft My Wife and I were taking our regular walk and heading home when I noticed a large Silver Cigar shaped Object off in the distance heading E/NE towards our location.  I also noticed another object flying parallel to it but at a pretty good distance apart which turned out to be a Grey colored jet.  The object was 4-5 times larger than the Jet as the Jet went almost directly over us and it's altitude was quite high.  As it went past it was Bright Silver due to the sun reflecting off of it.  Not long after that one got out of another Cigar shaped Object appeared heading in the same flight path as the first only there was no jet following this one.  All in all we were able to see a total of 8 of these Objects flying in the same direction but not all were in the exact same flight path as the first 2.  One of the Objects emitted some sort of a trail almost like a chem trail of a Jet but it didn't last long.;34.5062;-82.5067
