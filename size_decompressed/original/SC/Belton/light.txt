This object did slightly appear to flicker in the sky and stayed in position for several minutes.   Upon going back to look at approx 2050, the object was in a completely different portion of the sky and not really appearing to move.   When I went back to look at 2100, the object was gone.;34.5062;-82.5067
((HOAX??))  It looked as if two stars were shooting lasers at each other.;2015-06-11 22:00:00;30 seconds;It looked as if two stars were shooting lasers at each other. I was driving to my cousin's house, down 29 south, at around june 28th, and had just turned left on Danne Bannister road, and after about a mile I saw what appeared to be flashes of lightning at about a 70Â°incline to my left.  When I turned and looked it looked like two stars in the sky and they were shooting white laser lights at one another.   The lower one shot about four times then the one that was higher and to the right fired four times, then the lower one fired three more times only to get fired back at about five or six times.   Then they just sat there for maybe 30 seconds and the one that was higher moved in a half circle stopped underneath then took a right and vanished while the other just sat there. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report indicates a date of June 28, 2015, which is illogical, given that the date is still in our future.
