It was roughly 4:00am.  She stepped outside first as i was still inside. She shorlty called me to come out quick and that she had seen something strange in the sky. I stepped out to see a slow blinking white light about a mile away in the sky.  It was moving in a U shape, coming closer and then further away.  Then it just dissappeared. It only lasted about 30 seconds.  After ten minutes of waiting it never returned.;33.1213;-80.4033
