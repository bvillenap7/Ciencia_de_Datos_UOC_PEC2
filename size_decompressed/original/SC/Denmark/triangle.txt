My Son was near the window in his room talking on the phone, he called Mom come and see this, as I entered into the room and look out of the window which was open at the time because it was warm outside, I saw this black triangle thing with lights, it was moving slow, we watched it until it came over the house my Son said it is not making any sounds we both ran to the back door and stood on the steps to watch it when it got over the house, when it came in sight again from the front of the house to the back my son said to me again it is not making any sounds, what is that, it was so low I was afraid it was going to hit the top of my house.  As we stood looking I said to my Son no one will believe me and he said I know just as we said that the thing just took off fast and vanished right before our eyes. My Son has graduated form college now and everytime he comes to visit me, I asked him did you remember the thing we saw in the sky and he said yes, but we can't tell anyone no one will beleive us.  I held it for nine years and when I saw the story on Weird Travel I said to myself I need to tell my story, I did and now I feel better about it, although I know no one will believe me. Since I could on put one sighting on this page, I did the one that bother me the most.  In 2002 I also saw something that I reported to the Police, I don't know what it was and I was with my friend at the time when we both saw it.;33.319;-81.1391
