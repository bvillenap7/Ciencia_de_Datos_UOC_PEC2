Silver metal saucer, moving planks on the belly of the ship. Spinning lights on edge of saucer in sequences. Light on my face while in bed, rolled off the bed and crawled to window studup and looked but the light bent in the air and went up to the middle of saucer there was so many planks spinning and lights around the edge of saucer were also spinning around in sequence.  The saucer was a shiny silver metal.  Once the light noticed I wasn’t in my bed anymore, the light shot back into the saucer and the planks closed where the beam was coming out.  It then shot off so fast, it was the fasted thing I’d ever saw.  I watched it shoot off to my left into the far distance and vanish.

Disk;2012-10-24 18:42:00;5 seconds;On Wednesday evening, I was coming out of my house onto my back porch.  As I came down two steps, I looked south beyond our neighbor's house and saw a disk-shaped object.  It looked like a big black oval in the failing evening light.  I did not see any lights on it.  It flew horizontally.  I only saw it for about 5 seconds before it disappeared into the tree line.  From our house, we can hear when the larger jets land and take off from Columbia Metropolitan Airport.  This object made no sound.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
Disk with green & white plusing lights and shoots in air when approach.;2014-02-04 06:55:00;1-2;Disk with green & white plusing lights and shoots in air when approach. It was dark outside and on the way taking kids to school.  My nephew states look a cop plane and as we got closer it appeared to look like a UFO with green and white lights plusing.   I turned down old two notch road behind c-mart across from b-que resturant and when approaching the UFO it suddenly shot up in air  when I became close and as I passed the site where UFO was it dropped back down once I left the area.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
