Strange light in the sky seen while camping;2005-07-20 23:00:00;30 minutes;Strange light in the sky seen while camping I went out camping in the summer of 2005 with my scout troop.  We were camping on private property near Lexington, SC.  The event happened late at night while we were watching the fire and talking.  One of the troop leaders said that he had been watching a satellite that was crossing the sky, and then it had just stopped.  He pointed out to us where it was.  At first it just looked like a star in the sky.  It seemed a little odd because satellites usually blink and are not a constant light. After a while the light started to move around erratically.  This continued for some minutes then there was a small flash and the light split into two pieces.  After this happened one piece just stayed still and the other piece darted off across the sky.  I have no idea at the speed but it must have been pretty quick.  The other piece stayed there a while more and then it started to act erratically again.  After some time it then too darted off across the sky in the opposite direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Bright light moves slowly, stops,  and all of a sudden shoots off into space.;2009-06-12 21:00:00;10 seconds;Bright light moves slowly, stops,  and all of a sudden shoots off into space. I have seen this on two consecutive nights.  Looking nearly straight up ( I suppose you could say in the ne sky ) my wife and I saw a light.  This appeared to be a star at first but was larger. It was between the size of a star and the moon from our vantage point.  The object floated gently from left to right, stopped, and within seconds faded out to nothing, as if it were to have shot off into space directly away from earth.  I tend to look up at the sky and find the unusual, the only problem is that almost everything I have seen can be explained fairly easily.  This...I have no clue. The strange thing is that I saw the exact same thing, in the same part of the sky the night before as well.  It acted the same both times.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339

Silent orange balls of light in a straight line formation moving slowly for 5 minutes then dissapeared;2012-10-20 22:45:00;5 minutes;Silent orange balls of light in a straight line formation moving slowly for 5 minutes then dissapeared I noticed an orange ball of light in the sky and thought it was a meteor at first.  The light was coming from the west heading east too slow for a meteor.  Then I noticed 3 to 4 more orange balls of light spaced evenly like a formation one after the other and thought they could be helocopters.  The Orange balls had no strobe, red or green &quotaircraft&quot lights and they were silent.  The objects flew in a straight line in front of me going from my right to my left.  The lead light seem to make a slight turn then dissapeared in open sky.  Then one by one as the other orange objects reached the exact location of the lead object dissapearence they too turned and vanished.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
15 to 25 orange round lights above Lexington in a formation.;2013-01-12 22:00:00;15 minutes;15 to 25 orange round lights above Lexington in a formation We saw about 15 to 25 orange round lights following each other in a formation in kind of a straight line..some of the lights fading out of the formation.  We guessed that the lights could be about 1500 feet up.  The strange thing no sound like you would expect from an aircraft.  This was witnessed in the night sky above Lexington/Columbia SC.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
Orange lights.;2013-11-29 19:00:00;10 minute;Orange lights were silent and flying one behind the other then disappearing at the same place in the sky and were not flashing or blinking they were steady.   About two minutes later a plane came through on the same path of the orange lights were on looking for the lights but the lights were gone.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
Bright red-orange object that looked like a star.;2014-11-10 21:30:00;5 minutes;Bright red-orange object that looked like a star. I came outside and saw a bright red light that looked like the north star except for color.  My first instinct was to go and get my camera.  But instead I just stood and watched it thinking maybe it’s just a plane, because it was moving slowly across the sky.  I thought that planes all have flashing lights and all I saw was this magnificent bright red light that appeared to be slightly orange in color like maybe it had a white light in the middle.   It moved from probably south to north and all of a sudden it just dimmed and went out.  I thought it may have went behind clouds.  I looked hard into the sky and all I could see was stars and even a jet with its flashing lights at a very high altitude.   What I saw appeared to be at a low to medium altitude and not obscured by any tree line.  So I had a clear view of it until it just disappeared.  I hate that I didn’t get my camera.   It’s the first time in my 50 + years that I have ever witnessed such a sight.  I guess that’s what I get for being skeptical and thinking it has to be a plane.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339

While stopped at a traffic light in Lexington, SC, on Wise Ferry Road, a bright blue light was hovered slightly above the tree line for a few seconds, then suddenly fell behind the tree line.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
