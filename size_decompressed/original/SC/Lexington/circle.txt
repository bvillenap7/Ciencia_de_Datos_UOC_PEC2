Alternating green, white, red lights. 3 objects hovering at different locations with alternating green and red lights centered by a bright white light.  These did not appear to be standard aircraft due to the duration of appearing in the same locations.  We are in close proximity to an Air force base and a major airport. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness is reporting, but our experience suggests that the first possibility that would have to be ruled out would be celestial bodies, either stars or planets.
