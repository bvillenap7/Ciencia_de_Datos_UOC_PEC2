Bright green through binoculars. Returns to same location. My husband and I go outside a lot at night. This week 3 nights we have seen the same bright light show up around the same location. It is a very bright light and low in the sky.  Through binoculars it is a bright glowing green color. It will move very slowly at times from side to side, up and down and back and forth. Sometimes it moves a little faster when moving.  The photographs I took show the object in colors of green, purple, pink and white and in different shapes. When I am outside it doesn't move as much. When I go inside and look at it from the window, it moves a lot more. This goes on for hours.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
