A star-like object was seen during the day, before it changed to a bright red and vanished.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-27 17:30:00;~3 minutes;A star-like object was seen during the day, before it changed to a bright red and vanished. I was on my way home from school at about 5:30 pm EST, when I saw what looked to be a star to the West of where I was.  This confused me, since the sun had not completely gone down yet, and the 'star' was as bright as Polaris on a dark night.   About 1 minute passed before a cloud covered the 'star'.  When it emerged about 1 minute later, it was glowing a bright red.  It had not moved from its position the entire time, so it didn't seem to be a plane or jet.   About 30 seconds passed before a cloud covered it again.  The cloud completely passed after around 10 seconds, but the 'star' had completely vanished.   I asked someone in the car if they saw it, but she didn't seem to notice it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
