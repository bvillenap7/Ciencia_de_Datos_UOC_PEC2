8 Red-Orange Lights moving across the sky, then fading observed by several witnesses.;2014-03-22 21:30:00;3 minutes;8 Red-Orange Lights moving across the sky, then fading observed by several witnesses. Driving up Hwy Number 1 in Lexington, near Calks Ferry Road.  Saw weird arrangement of 3 red-orange lights above a cell tower.  After doing a double take I noticed the lights weren't as bright as the cell tower's lights and were much higher.  My fiancee then asked if I was seeing the 5 lights that were lined up in the sky.   I looked right and sure enough there were 5 more lights not to far from the original 3 I saw.  They were slowly moving across the sky to the West.   We then noticed several cars pulled over on the side of the road with people staring up and pointing.   I pulled over on Calks Ferry Rd. and my Fiancee got out of the car, another car coming the opposite direction pulled up and the driver and her friend asked if we were stopped because of the lights, which to me confirmed we weren't just seeing things. The lights that were lined up in a line started fading first, one after the other.   Then the 3 I originally saw in a triangle formation all faded at the same time.   They were clearly visible for at least 3 minutes.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
