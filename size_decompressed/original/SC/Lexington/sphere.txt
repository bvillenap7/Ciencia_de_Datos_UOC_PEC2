Largest starlike object floats through sky and disappears into.space.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??  PD));2012-10-18 07:45:00;20 seconds;largest starlike object floats through sky and disappears into.space I have been a sky watcher since my first encounter back in 1985 when I saw my first Ufo.  I see on almost a weekly basis a starlike object floating across the sky at nearly double the speed of a 747 that comes from the northeast and travels south west and disslappears into space within a few seconds. I live near a major airport and know what a plane looks like at 35000 feet.  This is more like 30000 feet to disappearance in a few seconds.  Not sure what I'm seeing but its not a plane.  Someone out there has the answers but I doubt I will find out in my lifetime.  Maybe I don't want to know.  I'm jaded with the whole subject due to the misinformation and lies. We know something is going on but no one is ready to man up with the answers.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
Two orange spheres seen travelling towards storm.;2013-08-29 21:05:00;2 minutes;Two orange spheres seen travelling towards storm. I was driving Northeast in Lexington towards a very active lightning storm that was coming in over Columbia when I noticed two bright orange orbs.   They hovered parallel to one another for about 5 to 10 seconds then began moving very slowly towards the Northeast.   I lost sight of them when they passed beyond the top of the tree line.   It is possible they may have been some form of lightning I am unfamiliar with given the sever storm that was coming in from that direction, but the orbs seemed to be ahead of the storm moving towards it.   The entire event lasted about two minutes from the time I spotted them to the time they were out of my view.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
I saw 3 sphere shaped fire orange colored objects in the sky.;2015-02-24 20:00:00;10 minutes;I saw 3 sphere shaped fire orange colored objects in the sky. We were coming home from Myrtle Beach, SC, and when we were pulling into our home, I looked out of the window and saw what looked like orange and red fire maybe in a sphere shape.   I saw the first one and followed it and it disappeared,  I thought that was it and was very confused about what I had seen, I then saw another one and another.  It was glowing.;33.9582026694051;-81.2345562628339
