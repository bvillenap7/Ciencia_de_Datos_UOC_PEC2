Black cigar shaped object hovering after storm over Red Bank in Lexington South Carolina;2010-06-16 17:00:00;30 sec;Black cigar shaped object hovering after storm over Red Bank in Lexington South Carolina In Red Bank, after the storms had passed through, my husband, daughter, and I were sitting on our porch enjoying the cooler temperature from the storms.  I glanced up into the haze of out-flowing clouds and inside of them I saw this dark, cigar shape just sitting in the thick haze.  I couldn't tell you how high up it was, but originally I thought maybe it was a goose about to land in the pond, but the object didn't get any closer.  It simply hovered and would vanish into the clouds and then back out again.  I told my husband to look because there isn't any towers or high trees like that around, I had to see if he saw it too.  Every time I would point the object would slowly fade into the hazy clouds, then back out.. it never once went higher or lower.  It would only fade out and in until eventually it was gone.
