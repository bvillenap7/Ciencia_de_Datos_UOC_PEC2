A flash of light went across the lake;2001-02-14 22:00:00;1 minute;A flash of light went across the lake I live on a small lake in South Carolina.   One night I was sitting out on the dock and I saw a flash of light go across the sky.  It zoomed right across the lake and went back up into the sky.  I have never seen anything like it before.;34.1613;-82.0302
