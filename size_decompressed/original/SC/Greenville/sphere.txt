7-8 yellow/orange lit objects flew by in loose formation.;2013-07-29 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;7-8 yellow/orange lit objects flew by in loose formation. On July 29th, 2013, at approximately 9:30 pm my husband and I went out to walk the dog.  We saw, crossing our path on high, 7-8 orange/yellow lit spherical objects sail by in a loose formation.  They flew by in absolute silence - leisurely - not fast like a jet nor hovery like a helicopter. They flew from southwest to northeast - disappearing in the distance. We live near a hospital so are quite familiar with the life-flight helicopter coming and going from the hospital.  We will also hear on occasion incoming or out-going jets to the local Greenville/Spartantburg Airport.  These objects were none of these.  We called to our neighbor to come and see them which she did. I am a local physcian with a fairly analytical mind.  I was not intoxicated.  My husband in a retired USMC Lt. Col and our neighbor is an executive in local charitable organization. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Fire ball spear moving extremely fast and hovering over my house Greenville SC;2020-05-15 21:35:00;5 minutes;Fire ball spear moving extremely fast and hovering over my house Greenville SC This is the 2nd time this particular UFO has flown over my house. Large ball of fire seems to be spinning. Moves extremely fast then stops and hovers. When it disappears it literally just vanishes!!! Iâ€™m December we saw around 20. They seemed to make laps around a spot light the local Christian college shines every Christmas. They would make laps around and come back. In pairs or 4 together. Then a few one by one. In the sky compared to the moon they are massive. Please let me know if there are any other reports in my area. Thank you. ((name deleted));34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
