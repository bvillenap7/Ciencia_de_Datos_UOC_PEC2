We were heading down the cut-through road that runs parallel with Mitchell Road in Greenville, SC towards Hudson Road when we spotted this craft.   I stopped the truck and we got out to observe.  We watched this thing for over 15 minutes.   It was completely silent and just hovering over the tops of pine trees.  It was absolutely huge. I am guessing that it was as big as a football field.   It was shaped like similar to a blimp.  It had red, green,  and amber/yellow lights all over it.  There were no aviation lights on it anywhere that a typical manmade craft would have.  The UFO slowly faded beyond our sight beyond the pine trees as the Sun came up.   I called the local radio station that morning to see if anyone else had seen it.  I could hardly believe that nobody else saw it.  Another friend of mine lived right near this sighting and is positive that it was a blimp that he saw there all the time.  Michellin is close by, but this was not a blimp in my opinion.   I have searched high and low on the Internet to find a blimp that was anything like this to no avail.  Also, why would a blimp be flying at 5:45 AM? I noticed on a website that indexes sightings that a gentleman in Boone, NC also saw a craft almost identical around the same time.
