Fireballs seen over the sky in Greenville, South Carolina on Thanksgiving 2001.;2001-11-22 00:00:00;30 minutes;Fireballs seen over the sky in Greenville, South Carolina on Thanksgiving 2001. It was Thanksgiving 2001 and my mother and I were on the way to visit my grandfather in Iva, South Carolina.  We were travelling southbound on I-85.   We saw what appeared to be just 2 or 3 fireballs in the sky.  I thought at first that they were airplanes, but over the course of about 30 minutes, about 50 or more of these objects appeared in the sky.  They were going in all directions...up, down, side to side.  Some were stationary for a while, and then just shot up into the sky...or to the side...or straight down!   It was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen.  We saw cars parked on the side of the road observing this as well, but as yet I have been unable to find any newspaper article or other eyewitness account of the event.  It was so obvious and so clearly seen - I know there must be others who saw it as well.   The best way I can describe the appearance is that each one looked like a fireball.  They were very small, so I assume they were very far away but I don't know how far.  They were covering the whole horizon.   Since this happened right after September 11th, I was terrified that we were under a terrorist attack, but when we called someone to have them flip on the news, they saw nothing of the event on TV.   Once I got home after that weekend, I looked on the internet, posted to message boards - and found nothing.   I am certain that what I saw was NOT some natural light phenomenon, nor was it airplanes - unless there were 50+ experimental aircraft in the sky.  These did not move the way normal planes move - they were going in EVERY direction imaginable.   I can't explain it, but I would very much like to know if anyone else saw it.
