Cluster of 15-25 objects moving in a SSW direction, with 3 of the objects making distinct manouvers suggesting some kind of intelligenc;2002-01-07 15:10:00;approx 5 minutes;Cluster of 15-25 objects moving in a SSW direction, with 3 of the objects making distinct manouvers suggesting some kind of intelligenc While taking break at our hangar at Donaldson Center Airport near Greenville SC on the afternoon of Jan 7 2002, witness whom we work with was outside taking a break when he looked up and saw something that grabbed his attention. He then summoned the rest of us out to take a look. Directly overhead, at an extremely high altitude, were what appeared to be just 5 objects moving in a SSW direction. After focussing a little more on the area of the objects, more faint objects appeared and as it turns out, there were no less than 15, and perhaps as many as 25 objects in a cluster moving in a SSW direction. There was no activity on the flightline at the airport, sicne it is mainly used as an overhaul facility for military and commercial aircraft, so if those objects were planes, we should have been able to ehar them, but there was no sound. Nor was tehre any contrail. Looking at other portions of the sky were planes had recently flown by, there were contrails. These objects left no trace of contrails. Less than a minute into this event, 3 objets on teh west flank of the cluster shifted and moved to the east side of the clutster while the other objects went in a straight line to the SSW. It is difficult to describe the shape of the objects, because they were at an extremely high altitude, well beyond jetliner altitude. My best guess was that they either an oval or circular in shape, and definately did not have tails like a jet would have, but they were at too high an altitude to be aircraft anyway. I am also a weather enthusiast, and 2 hours after the event I decided to check upper level winds (38,000 ft and above)and they were moving at a general easterly direction at the time. So, this rules out balloons and the like. The 3 or 4 objects that swapped from the west flank to the east flank appeared to have some kind of intelligence behind it. They were distinct manouvers. I am submitting this report in hopes that others who saw this event will come foreward and report it to this database also, because I realize that the thought of seeing this many objects at the same time is rather rare and incredible.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
watched object travel across sky and quickly gain speed and suddenly disappear;2019-12-20 07:45:00;2 minutes;watched object travel across sky and quickly gain speed and suddenly disappear My Mother and I were turning into Bons Secours St. Francis Hospital and noticed a bright flying object in the sky with a distinct illuminated trail behind it. At first we thought it could be a plane reflecting the suns light until we realized the sun was still not in sight. We watched the object travel across the sky and then witnessed it start dissipating and then saw it appear to go into hyper speed and quickly disappear. The flight path/trail was clearly visible for up to 5 minutes after the sighting. Also captured some of the event on video.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
Unseen UFO Appears In One of Two Photographs Taken Less Than 5 Seconds Apart;2021-06-12 20:36:00;5 Seconds;Unseen UFO Appears In One of Two Photographs Taken Less Than 5 Seconds Apart I was facing west and watching the sunset in a parking lot across the street from the downtown municipal airport. There were no planes on the ground or in the air. There were no birds flying and no wind. There was no sound of any kind other than birds chirping in the trees.  I shot two pictures less than five seconds apart with my cell phone camera. I did not see or hear anything in the sky. The second witness with me quickly noticed an object in one of the pictures which we could not identify. Neither one of us saw the object in the sky or heard it come or go, but it appeared in one of two photographs taken less than 5 seconds apart.  The object in the photograph is completely black with no lights of any kind and it has an irregular elongated shape.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
