I looked up and saw what I thought at first were meteors  coming down but I quickly realized they were coming down too uniformly and not burning out (not leaving a trail).  At first I was seeing two 'burns' then, looking for more, I looked ahead of the direction they were going and seen a third 'burn'.  I didn't think of them as lights, they were more like a friction burn .  These three burns against the starry sky outlined a huge triangular object.  We were heading to work therefore didn't wait for it to go out of sight.  I called the local TV station the next day and was told they were meteors. I told them I had seen them and they were not meteors.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
Strange Triangle Hovering/Moving slowly then vanishing.;2004-08-23 23:10:00;5-7 mins;Strange Triangle Hovering/Moving slowly then vanishing. When I first saw it I was heading east on I-185 right at the intersection of I-85 and I-185.  It was about 75 degrees up to the north of the road.  There were 4 white lights, about 1.5 the birghtness of venus in a line along what appeared to be the back over a distance of about 1.5x the diameter of a full moon.  Centered on the 4 back lights about the diameter of the moon away was another white light.  About half way between the single light and the middle of the 4 lights there was one red light, slightly brighter than the white ones.  It appeared to be facing west(the single white light was to the west of the 4 white ones.  It did not appear to be moving at all at this time(about 45 seconds).  I exited onto I-85 south and went south ~2 miles and turned around at that exit and went back to try and find a place where I could get out to look at it safely. When I arrived back it was to the south of I-185.  It was moving very slowly south parallel to I-85. It was at about 65 degrees up.  From this angle there were 2 white lights, the same distance apart as the farthest of the line of 4, and there was a red light, about 1/4 the diamater of the moon above the middle of the white lights. I watched it for about a minute, while glancing at road enough to stay on it(wide interstate, so not much).  I glanced at the road and looked back.  It was gone.  It is possible that it flew into a cloud, because it wasn't too far from the moon in the sky which was temporarly behind a cloud.  The cloud moved on leaving a clear sky in the direction.  I turned around and headed back towards 85 then south.  There was no more sign of the object the rest of my trip home. There are reguarly planes in the area, and I watch them reguarly.  This was moving much slower(didn't move for about 45 secs), than any I've seen that were heading to land, or taking off from any airports in the are, also appeared larger than these usually do.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905

It was hard to tell how big it was, but it was close to the tree lines and appeared as large as a bus,maybe larger.  It had several lights around the perimeter that were Red, yellow and green.  It got above our car and to the left and just disappeared into thin air.  PS,  there were reports of it being seen in our area, from charlotte NC on down to the coast of SC.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
Dark triangular UFO with three white lights, one red light, hovering in the sky;2008-07-09 22:15:00;4 minutes;Dark triangular UFO with three white lights, one red light, hovering in the sky I was driving home from night school on highway 14 between Roper Mountain and Pelham road. I was headed northbound. In the northwestern sky (a bit to my left out my car window), I noticed some new lights (it's a regular commute) over the top of some trees. I know you know where this is going, ha ha. Too big to be a radio tower, and stationary, so not an airplane. I, of course, used these two anchors of logic to dissuade me from what I thought I was actually seeing, but it was when I made out a chassis that my foot hit the brake and I slowed to a crawl.... it was wobbling... I started screeching all kinds of disbelieving profanities and I KNOW someone else saw it because as I was swerving off the road I saw another car wandering off to the side of the road as well, and they quickly passed.  It was triangular, dark and metallic, very sleek and smooth, with three white lights at each vertex and a concave red light, and it seemed blurry because the darn thing was wobbling a bit. I forced myself to look at the road and was surprised to find an unnatural glow around myself and the car, and as it grew brighter, I brought my eyes upward and caught it above my windshield and I craned my neck and promptly began to panic because the craft was now above my car, silent, higher up in the air but still too close for comfort, 500 feet perhaps.... I'm a horrid judge of distance....  It was at this moment I smelled, yes I know.... sulfur.... something like sulfur, so strong I held my hand over my face. I was fixated on the craft, but I had to look at the road.... kept swerving once again, thank goodness the road was now empty, and, yes, of course, when I looked back up it was gone. Nowhere in the sky...;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905

Triangle of 3 lights seen from I-85 hovering over Mauldin Rd area.;2014-01-30 23:45:00;4-5 minutes;Triangle of 3 lights seen from I-85 hovering over Mauldin Rd area Driving down 85 South, looking over the Mauldin Rd area, I saw three solid white lights in the form of a triangle.  There was a tiny blinking red light.   Iâ€™m not sure what it was, but it sat in the same spot in the sky for the four or five minutes I was approaching it, then once I got a little ways past it, the lights disappeared.   I just wonder if others saw the same thing because several cars around me slowed down and were swerving.   I saw this light cluster between 11:40pm and 11:44pm on 30 January 2014.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
