I HAVE BEEN CHASED BY A HUG BRIGHT LIGHT BEHIND ME IN A CAR AND TRUCK AT NIGHT!;1972-10-04 22:00:00;5 minutes;I HAVE BEEN CHASED BY A HUG BRIGHT LIGHT BEHIND ME IN A CAR AND TRUCK AT NIGHT! The first time I saw a bright light was when I was only 16 years old and I was on a date.  We were on Fork Shoals rd. and heading towards my home.  A huge light, It was the brightest light I had ever seen in my life.  It was so bright that we could hardly seen how to drive.  The faster my date drove the light stayed right with us.  Finally after about 5 minutes driving about 70 mph, the light just disapeared! We had no idea what it was or where it came from, all I know was we were young and never had seen anything like it before until in 1999 and I was driving a friend of mine's straight truck that we was going to Georgetown,SC to pick up her 2 mirrows and gas lanterns for her new house.  We had just left Florence,S.C. where we had stopped and eat and it was late, around 9:30. I had just pulled out onto highway 20 leaving Florence. I had just stopped at a red light and was not speeding and all of a sudden we saw a bright light behind us. The first thing I thought of was the police! I told my friend, oh, No! I said it's the police, and I started to pull over on side of the road and said to her...what I'm I been stopped for? I just pulled off from the red light! As I started to stop, The light vanished! NO Police, NO Lights, Everything was gone! Not a car around us anywhere, and there were cars there at the light when we stopped. Everything went from bright light all around us, to no light and Nobody around us!! It scared us so bad, we didn't know what had been behind us, because no cars, no police went around us at all. We have never forgotten that night or I the night when I was only 16 years old and on a date! What was this light? It was like a HUG white/blue LED LIGHT and No sound. Twice I have been chased by a HUG BRIGHT LIGHT, WHY?;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
Dancing Star;2000-12-15 22:00:00;45 sec;Dancing Star As my family and I were leaving a restaurant, I, riding in the back or the vehicle gazed at the night sky.  I saw more stars than usual on that very clear winter night, however one star appeared to move, however I just over looked it and continued looking around enjoying the beautiful night, but i looked up at the white light again and it began to dance about in the sky, in all directions, much like a ball in the game of pong, it just seemed to bounce around in the sky, I told my family to look in the same general area but as you can imagine they were to engaged in their own conversation to look up at the sky and it is difficult to spot a single light among hundreds even if it was moving. I am usually very skeptical in the paranormal, however this event that took place several years ago has altered my opinion on the possibility of ET life.

I am sure that I was awake, and I wasn't hurt at all.;2002-04-23 02:00:00;10 minutes;I am sure that I was awake, and I wasn't hurt at all. I was lying in bed that night after a long day ay school I could not sleep.  I though I heard faint whispers somewhere in my room.  Suddenly, a light in the middle of my room glimmered, grew, and shone brightly for a few minutes, then faded with a sigh-like sort of sound.  I then felt a sort of tingle across my face, neck, and down my arm, then my hand began to throb.  It tingled and pulsed, and began to glow a deep dark bluish-green.  Then a flash of light, and I felt like I was being lifted into the air, and dropped back onto my bed.  I am sure that I was awake, and I wasn't hurt at all.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905

Not long after crossing the Greenville county line I noticed 2 lights sitting at a 45 degree angle.  we both just watched it hover. At the time we were about 30 mins. from home. The whole time the thing just sat there hovering. After arriving home , my girlfriend went to bed. I stayed up till 6:30 or 7:00. Before I went to bed I walked outside and it was still there. Still sitting at an angle in the same place. I mentioned this to friends whom also saw it 2 nights before, doing the exact same thing,hovering. The morning I saw this I had a weird experience in my livingroom. It seemed like several dimenions were opened at once. For example, I saw a guy in my kitchen, another guy standing by the TV and I saw another guy come through the front door.I know it sounds weird. But I'm comfortable with it.It seems that the other guys were too.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905

A Bright COlor Changing Light over Southern NC and Upstate SC is seen and reported by Thousands.;2007-01-24 20:00:00;5-10 seconds;A Bright COlor Changing Light over Southern NC and Upstate SC is seen and reported by Thousands. In the early evening of 01/24/07, around 20:00 hours (8:00 pm Eastern Standard time), thousands of local residents began calling into local news stations and the local police call center to report a bright, color-changing object in the sky.    As reports continued to be filed, the magnitude of this occurrence began to be more fully understood.  People within a several hundred mile radius (myself included) witnessed a high velocity blue light, moving across the sky in a southern direction, leaving a trail behind it.  This light changed in color from blue, to White, to green.   From my vantage point, the light (at this point was green in color) seemed to take a sharp dive toward the ground and was lost behind the tree line.  Shortly before it reached the tree line, a smokey or hazy effect surounding the light became visible.  The sky was partly cloudy that evening, and the light seemed to pass between myself and the clouds upon its descent.  [Note:  This haze may have been the light passing through a low cloud, giving it a smokey look...it happened very fast, and the refraction of light in cloud vapor may very well be the source of the haze.]   The national weather service has begun investigating, but so far has not yielded any results.  There are various reports of Government entities in the area including FBI and NSA, but no comments or official statements have been released thus far.   The Greenville/Spartanburg Airport has not released any information as to a possible radar tagging of this object, and anyone official that could possibly verify the presence of something in the South Carolina skies that night has remained annoyingly mum.   Those of us that witnessed the event all agree that this object was far to bright and concentrated to be weather related, and the nature of its movements, and the brilliance of the light that was emitted, lead all of us to believe that it was not an airplane, or known  aerial craft.   The presence of these government agencies in our relatively small southern town has raised a few eyebrows.   Was this a UFO?  I have no clue, but I have never seen anything like it, and I am anxiously awaiting an official answer/report on the phenomenon.

10-12 points of light flying in the sky in formation.;2012-12-31 21:30:00;2 minutes;10 to 12 points of light flying in the sky in formation. My husband and I were driving down the road on New Year's Eve in Greenville, SC and noticed 10 to 12 points of white light flying in formation from west to east.  They were making no sound whatsoever.  We stopped the car and took pictures which did not come out.  They slowly disappeared in a couple minutes.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905

Four red/orange lights in cross formation hovering in sky, then disappear into thin air.;2013-04-06 20:00:00;2 minutes;Four red/orange lights in cross formation hovering in sky, then disappear into thin air. We were driving home with the kids and noticed four red/orange lights in the sky.  They caught my attention as they were in an almost cross formation or a &quotT&quot.  We pulled over to get a better look, and to listen.  We assumed they were helicopters. No other air crafts could be in that formation and their proximity to one another were close.  Furthermore they seemed motionless.   Upon pulling over we noticed two had disappeared. We watched the last two start to separate and then just disappear.  There was virtually no cloud cover so they did not disappear into a cloud.  They just vanished.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
Red/orange lights in a formation.;2013-05-12 21:45:00;5-7 minutes;red/orange lights in a formation On the evening of May 12, 2013 at 21:45 I observed 4 glowing orange/red lights moving across the sky at a constant speed seeming slightly faster than a commercial airliner. I went next door to my beighbor's house and asked him to look at what I was seeing. He came out and we watched the lights until they faded out. The lights were in a ''W'' formation moving from West to Southeast before fading out. I heard no sound, and could not make out a shape of any kind. This is the first time I have ever seen anything that I could not recognize.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
