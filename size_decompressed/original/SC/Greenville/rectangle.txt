YOU MUST BE CRAZY, OR WHAT WERE YOU DRINKING. WELL, HERE GOES!  MY GIRLFRIEND AND MYSELF WERE LEAVING MY PARENTS HOUSE AND TAKING THE BACK ROADS TO HER COMMUNITY TO GO CHURCH. APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES DOWN WOODRUFF RD.FROM I-85 HEADED TOWARD MAULDIN, S. C., WE SPOTTED A LINE OF CARS PARKED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.  THERE WAS NOTHING THERE BUT OPEN FIELDS. EVERYONE WAS OUT OF THEIR CARS AND LOOKING UP TOWARDS THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD. WE GOT OUT AND LOOK UP IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND WHAT A SIGHT TO BEHOLD.  HOVERING OVER THIS FIELD WAS A HUGE RECTANGULAR OBJECT APPROX. 300-500 FT. IN THE AIR APPROX. 2500-3000 FT. LONG.  ALL YOU COULD HEAR WAS A SLIGHT HUMMING SOUND.  THEN OUT OF NOWHERE TWO SMALLER VERSIONS APPEARED, ONE ON EACH SIDE. ALL THREE OBLECTS WERE PERFECT RECTANGULAR SHAPED.  THEY ALL HAD A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF RED AND WHITE LIGHTS GOING AROUND THEM AND TO BE HONEST WITH THE TOP OF EACH LOOKED LIKE A BATTLESHIP OF OUR NAVY. WHEN THEY LEFT, IT WAS ALMOST INSTANTANEOUS.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
