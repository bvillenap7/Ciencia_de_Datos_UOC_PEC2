We noticed two cigar shaped objects floating in the sky for a brief moment and then one of them shot off.  After about 30 seconds the other one followed.  They just had bright light.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
Slow moving UFO through semi-cloud cover on the night of a meteor shower, most definatly not a meteor.;2009-08-13 01:26:00;30 seconds or less;Slow moving UFO through semi-cloud cover on the night of a meteor shower, most definatly not a meteor. That night, I was on my roof trying to see the expected meteor shower. Around 1 o'clock, the clouds began to roll in. The shower was supposed to be at 2 I believe.  At 1:26, I witnessed the craft come into view from my left, behind me.  It was very low to the trees. I turned around and watched it go left across the sky.  It was absolutely silent.  Being accustomed to all types of planes or helicopters flying over head, I knew what to listen for.  But there was nothing.  It had two white lights on the front, and then three more white, yet somewhat smaller, down the side. These lights would strobe on and off. In a pattern.  The first would light, the second one would light, then the third would light. Each of these would fade as the next came on.  It was somewhat cigar shaped, but had a wider front end. I watched it slowly glide to the left, and then slowly arch back to the right, over the tree tops, and slip out of sight.  The craft was going very slow.  But it felt so! close.  Literally 500 feet away from me.  I should've taken a picture, but I was too captivated by what I was seeing.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
