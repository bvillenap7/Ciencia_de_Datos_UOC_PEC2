What looked to be a three stars in a triangular formation was moving across the sky at about the same pace as a satelite. They were very spread out...probably miles apart, but were moving the exact same speed. The space in between them was clear and we could see stars through it, so I know that there were three individual craft, not one craft with three lights. Also, we could tell that they were out of the earth's atmosphere because the sun was reflecting off of them, like it does on satelites. It seemed that they weren't shining their own lightsource. My brother and I had never seen anything like this before. We spotted them when they were about half way across the sky, and they were off of the horizon in about a minute. Pretty wild.

Driving with my sister-in-law.  We first saw them on Pleasantburg between Wade Hampton and Rutherford.;2017-03-19 21:15:00;10 minutes;I was visiting Greenville, SC, driving with my sister-in-law.  We first saw them on Pleasantburg between Wade Hampton and Rutherford. NE to SW.   At first my sister-in-law thought they were lights on Paris Mountain, and as we got closer she said that they are not lights on the mountain, because they were moving, lower then an airplane, going in line and heading in a SW direction.   They stood still in their course and began to rise up into space and finally disappeared.   We pulled over during the event, it was a very bright area,  I took a picture and video. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness forward the photos and video.  PD));34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
