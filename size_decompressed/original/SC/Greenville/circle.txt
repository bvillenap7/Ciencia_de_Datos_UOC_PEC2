I was a married 22 year old with three sons [ twins age 5 and the youngest just 2. I was visiting relatives in Greenville South Carolina on May 11,1972 at approximatly 9:30 pm. I pulled the car off the highway and drove to a clearing where my cousin's trailer was sitting.As i stopped the car the engine still running, i noticed a green light moving up vertically to tree top level. It seemed to float up and stop, then all of a sudden it jerked to the left faster than anything i had ever seen, stopped on a dime, floated up, it did this motion 3 more times [ like a climbing stairs motion ]until the object was directly in front of the car. It then began to float over the car, my heart was pounding and my head was spinning, i was totally stunned!I cathered up all the courage that i could muster and jumped out of the car and looked straight up, there was nothing only blackness! I had my three small children asleep in the back seat.The one min. that this sighting took has changed my life forever, i no longer have the luxury of not beliveing.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905

Last night 11/03/2012 around 10:05 pm, as I was on my way to work, I looked up into the sky and seen a lot of objects slowly moving to the west.  There were at least 50 to 60 0f them.  They looked to be almost round in shape and about the size of a basketball.  They were red and orange colored and looked like a small flame around them.  I pulled my truck over and got out to get a better look at them.  I did not hear no sound in the sky.  I tried to take pictures of these objects with my camera phone but as I aimed my camera toward the sky all I could get was a black screen.  I couldnâ€™t believe what I was seeing.   I stood there and watched the objects for about 10 minutes and had to leave.;34.8398489971342;-82.3661557390905
