Bright orange disk shaped objects over Garden City SC.;2011-04-01 22:15:00;2 MIN;Bright orange disk shaped objects over Garden City, SC. I was sitting on my front porch about 10:15 pm when through the trees coming straight at me was this bright orange light.  I stood up and when it cleared the trees I could see it was a round glowing object. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and made no sound.  When it was directly above me it flickered and went almost dark but what blew me away was I could see a solid shape against the night sky moving away from me at a high rate of speed and I lost sight of it.  I went to sit down and I looked up and in the same exact spot 2 more lights, the same color, same shape, traveling at the same speed came over and flickered and went almost dark and I could see the disk shaped objects again against the night sky moving away guickly and again with out a bit of noise.  The sky was clear and bright with stars, with no moon at that time.  I know what satalites look like and these where not satalites!  I have never in my life seen anything like this before and am baffled.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996

My husband and 14 year old son ran to the front and the disk shaped craft was flying low and making a pulsating sound.  It was round like a disk and flat on the bottom with blinking lights on both sides.  It was flying really slow.   There was also a beam of light shining down on the ocean when it was sitting still.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996
