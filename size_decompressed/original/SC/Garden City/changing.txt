Strange light over the Atlantic.;2017-04-19 02:53:00;1 minute;Strange light over the Atlantic. I watch the skies a lot.  Never see anything other than military fighters or transports here with the daily rotor craft.   Tonight while taking the dogs out for the fee final time at around 253 AM, I looked east towards the adjacent skyline to notice an amber or pink/orange light in the sky.  At first, I thought it was an oddly shaped planet.   To my utter surprise and disbelief my eyes did not decided he and the light began to move.  Then another light became evident.  The two then converged and grew brighter.  They appeared to be about thirty miles east over the Atlantic ocean.  I would guess their altitude to be in the 10-15k ft area.  Really interesting.   Also of note is that the light appeared to line in the distant sky for a short time after it appeared the source had vanished.   Also of note is that after the point of conference the light send to emit in a more cross like display.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996
