Orange ball of light in Garden City, SC heading NE.;2012-11-23 19:20:00;1 minute;Orange ball of light in Garden City, SC heading NE 1 Ball of fire entering field of view at the horizon heading NE.  Limited perspective limited estimation of speed. Best guess would be 150-200 knots.  Heading NE parallel to coast. Description is flickering ball of fire, no trail, no sound.  No altitude deviation after it leveled off.  I think I saw an arced trajectory initially coming from either the beach area, or within a mile of the coast off Garden city, SC.   The observation lasted about one minute and I believe died from lack of illumination rather than from distance.   MYR tower was called, but they observed nothing. Flightaware.com was consulted, but there were no IFR flights in that vicinity reported.   I believe the light source died before it reached as far NE as Myrtle Beach.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996

Last night I walked onto balcony of condo and saw three large orange lights come on, one two three in a row.  We had seen this phenomena three years ago here.   I called to my family to come see the lights.  Within a few minutes successive large red/orange fireballs would illuminate and extinguish.   Then we noticed small blinking lights, numerous, up to ten at a time moving all over the sky in the area of the big orange lights.  All of this activity seemed to be from Garden City pier to Myrtle Beach State Park and mostly over ocean.  Any number of arrangement of lights were seen up to a large perfectly shaped chevron shape formed by eight of the big fireballs.   The fireballs appeared as groups of three and four tightly spaced as well.  At some intervals between fireball appearances there were as much as 5 to 10 solid minutes of small sparkling lights moving for miles up and down the coast.   I am employed in aviation and I am! reasonably convinced that no aircraft were seen.  The appearance as well as the silence had more of a ghostly feel than of nuts and bolts aircraft.  Many people were on beach so im sure others witnessed.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996
4 red lights all next to each other rotating around it seemed then orange looking flare lights going upwards.;2014-06-25 23:00:00;30 minutes;4 red lights all next to eachother rotating around it seemed then orange looking flare lights going upwards. I believe it was around 11pm close to that.  My sister and her husband and my mom were sitting on the back deck and she called me to look up at the sky over the ocean.  I said is that a UFO and that is what we all believed, then other people who were vacationing with us saw it to.  People next door and few doors down were all watching it.   The first one seemed to be towards the right in the sky over the ocean.  It looked to be rotating around I saw 4 red round shape lights all exactly next to each other seemed to be going around and it just faded out.   Then for the next few minutes we saw what looked like orange balls start as one then go upwards two three four.  It couldn't of been flares because it was moving from the right side of Garden City to Surf Side and towards Myrtle Beach way to fast.  They would start to light up going upwards then just fade out sometimes in the middle and towards the left at the same time.   Someone called the police dept to see if maybe was a distress flare they told her it was military drill or something of that sort.  It def looked like a UFO the first one we all saw the others in orangish color looked like some time of round flares but would start lighting up one then two then three going up then just disappear, was pretty freaky.

Multiple Fireballs sighted off Garden City pier;2014-06-26 21:00:00;1 hour;Multiple Fireballs sighted off Garden City pier My family had been seeing odd lights in the sky over the ocean all week. I had to see for myself and walked out on the Garden City pier around 10:00 PM.  Apparently the lights had been seen earlier according to other family members.  I watched for about an hour as multiple lights would flash on, then off.  Sometimes singly, other times three in a row followed by three in a row.  They did not appear to move and seemed to last about 5-10 seconds before going out.  What was interesting was that the intensity was the same no matter where the lights appeared.  Maybe flares?  But very symmetrical in nature and occurrence.  Odd for sure, I've never seen anything like it.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996
