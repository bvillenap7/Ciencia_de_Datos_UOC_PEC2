6 equal size round amber colored lights equal distance apart, stationary for at least 2 hours.;1985-08-15 23:00:00;2 hours;6 equal size round amber colored lights equal distance apart, stationary for at least 2 hours. My mother, sister and I were sitting in back of our rental cottage (MY STARS) on lawn chairs in the sand facing the ocean as we did every night, every year where our family gathered for a week long vacation.   We all noticed about the same time that the amber circles which were all the same size appeared quite high above the ocean and a far distance from us in a line with a large but equal distance apart from each other.   They appeared stationary and were visible to us for at least two hours and were gone leaving no evidence including noise that they had ever been there.

A few minutes later 2 orange/yellow objects appeared over the ocean and then disappeared.  For approximately 15 minutes witnessed 10-15 objects that would appear solo or in groups.  This occurred slightly north of the Garden City pier.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996

Bright orange glow in the sky of the east coast.;2015-06-03 23:50:00;20-30 seconds;Bright orange glow in the sky of the east coast On June 3, 2015, I was on vacation with my family in Garden City, South Carolina (just south of Myrtle Beach). It was a full moon and absolutely beautiful outside, and at approximately 11:45 PM EDT, I went down to the beach to sit around for a while.   I got to the beach and was standing in ankle deep water trying to take a picture of the moon over the water, when I noticed something more directly overhead and to the right, which was south of my exact location.  Upon further investigation I saw a bright orange glow in the sky, and immediately thought “plane”.   I looked at it for another second or two and realized it wasn’t a plane at all-it was too bright, too consistent in color, and at the distance that I could perceive it was, moving far too fast to be a plane.  To serve as a point of reference, I immediately thought of planes that fly in on a regular basis.  Just earlier in the evening, I was sitting on the balcony with my grandparents, watching two planes circle over the ocean, before going back inland to land at Myrtle Beach airport.  They moved much slower than whatever the glowing orange thing in the sky was. I’m a Coast to Coast AM insider and overall nerd, so I immediately stopped trying to take a picture of the moon and started trying to get a picture/video of the bright orange glow in the sky.  Despite my best efforts, I couldn’t get my camera to focus on it and get a good look with my phone.  I don’t know if that was user error or something else. Also as a point of comparison, when you see a plane, and particularly soon after takeoff, it appears to go upwards, but also horizontally-it looks like its climbing at a steady rate.  While the bright orange glow was moving quickly, and upwards, after a couple seconds, it went straight up.  Its horizontal motion was short lived and once it started going straight up, it was completely out of sight within seconds. I took a second to gather myself and called a friend who is a fellow nerd and MUFON member.  My iPhone call record states I placed that call at 11:52 PM EDT, and I deduce the approximate time that I saw the bright orange glow was 11:50.   I only got to see it for 20-30 seconds, but there’s no doubt in my mind that whatever it was isn’t from around here. More about me I’m a church music director in a denomination of Christianity you’ve heard of before.  I have a undergraduate degree in church music, and I’m currently back in school working on an accounting-add on to my degree, with intentions of becoming a CPA.  As far as anyone can tell, I have a clean bill of mental health. I count myself lucky and blessed to have gotten to see something of such coolness on such a beautiful night.  The only thing I hate about it is no one else got to see it with me my girlfriend turned in early, and I’m kind of mad at her about it.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996

At least 5 miles off shore and over 5,000 feet high (comparing to boats and comercial aircraft in area at the time).  They light it up a row and seemed to be alternating positions.

Unidentified Objects - Garden City SC;2020-08-12 22:30:00;45 seconds;Unidentified Objects - Garden City SC Subject:  Unidentifiable object(s). Date: Wednesday, August 12th Approximate Time:  10:30PM Location:  1907 South Waccamaw, Garden City, South Carolina Viewed:  East North East 45° off the horizon Color: Bright Orange Shape:  circular Sound:  None Distance:  difficult to tell, but seemed far off out over the Atlantic Ocean. Size:  they seemed pretty darn big Movement:  seemed to be stationary, Starting with one orange orb, then adding 3 more (same size-one at a time). It took 8 to 10 seconds between each additional orb, but again, they were all from right to left and equidistant, in a straight line. Then, similarly another 4 more orbs came in succession (same size-one at a time), but the second group came in line much quicker (2-3 seconds apart), again right to left, adding to the first four orange orbs-totaling 8 in a straight line. Duration:  Once they were all in line, they all quickly disappeared at once. Note:  we could not tell if it was one object or 8 separate. Summation:  They were clearly not Aircraft’s as we know it. It was Clearly not a meteor. It was clearly not a lightning storm. It was clearly not fireworks. It was clearly not a light show. Thoughts:  The three of us that witnessed the sighting cannot imagine that no one else in any of the houses facing the ocean or people walking on the beach or people on the the pier did not see the object(s) too that on the contrary, with the amount of sky these bright orange orbs took lined up, someone had to see them.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996
