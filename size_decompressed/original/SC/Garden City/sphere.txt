Orange/Reddish glowing sphere over Atlantic in Garden City, SC;2016-05-15 21:15:00;2 minutes;Orange/Reddish glowing sphere over Atlantic in Garden City, SC Sitting in my car waiting to go in and pick up an ordered to go meal. I'm on Business 17 next to Greg's Cabana facing East looking across 17 towards the ocean. I look up into the night sky as I always do and I see an orange glowing sphere rising up in the sky. Judging from the distance I'm sure that it was out over the ocean.  The color is orange/red just like glowing fire, but no flame or flames.  Round spherical shape and as it began to rise higher, the color was changing to a more red and almost purple like shade and then back to the orange glowing fire color.  The size began to get smaller in diameter and while this was happening the color changed to white and it simply vanished into thin air. This is the first time that I have made a report on this or any site, but not the first time I've witnessed these unidentifiable flying objects.  I can honestly state that you're more likely to observe UFOs in this area than not.  It's that common here out over the ocean.  Over the last 6 years this makes about a dozen sightings for me.  Tonight, I was alone, but every other time there have been other witnesses and we all see the same things, colors, movements, etc. I personally, am of the opinion that somebody knows exactly what these things flying around are and where they come from and go to.  Otherwise some form of authority would be busy trying to investigate and determine why they're in our airspace and on a regular basis. I talk about my sightings and so many people in this area have had similar experiences.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996
Five bright orange orbs appear quietly over water not far from shore.  ((anonymous report));2017-04-19 20:50:00;20 seconds;Five bright orange orbs appear quietly over water not far from shore. Orange spheres quietly appeared over water, then disappeared.  We did not see movement of the objects.  They appeared and then faded away within a few seconds of each other.  They appeared to be in a straight line but the first and last were set further from the three in the middle.  They made no noise.   We witnessed similar orbs like this while visiting Gulf Shores three years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Large Orb that split into three orbs seen off South Carolina coast by five witnesses- June 18th, 2020;2020-06-18 21:30:00;Few seconds;Large Orb that split into three orbs seen off South Carolina coast by five witnesses- June 18th, 2020 The five of us were walking on the beach that night when one of my friends just exclaimed “What’s that?”  And we all look to face the ocean and a few miles off the coast directly in front of us we all see a large orangish-golden orb.  It stays motionless for a moment and then splits horizontally into three smaller orange orbs/balls of light.  They stayed motionless once they broke from the original until they just disappeared like someone had turned off a flashlight.  The way the object split into three was simply unnatural, and the way the lights moved.  About 20 minutes later we saw the same three objects, but oriented differently, in a tripod like shape and faintly, miles away in another direction away from us, before disappeared a second later.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996
