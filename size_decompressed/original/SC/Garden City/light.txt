Orange balls of light over the ocean fading in and out;2000-08-08 22:00:00;2 hours;Orange balls of light over the ocean fading in and out We were spending the week at the beach. On the second night, we noticed an orange orb of light out over the ocean but high enough to be a foot over the rooftops of the houses in front of ours. The lights were an orange color and were about the size of a street light. The sky would be dark, and all of a sudden, the light would just turn on instantly just like a car headlight. Only this was maybe 2 miles out over the ocean and were way too high in the sky to be confused for a boat on the horizon or a flare. The light would turn on, and start to dim and fade out. It would be dark again, and a few minutes would pass and all of the sudden it would turn on again, and begin to fade out again. We managed to capture this on video the second night with houses in front of us along with cars going by just to prove it was real. At one time, two lights would turn on at once and begin to fade out. I ruled it out that these could be natural occuring phenomon because there had to be thought behind it. There was a pattern that would keep occuring. The way the would light up one right after the other and fade out definitly showed that this could not have been any kind of ball lightning(no clouds) or a flare because a flare would be much brighter and would move. These lights never moved farther than a foot to the left or right. And every night, you could expect them to be in the same position. We could basically time them and know exactly what time they would occur.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996
Sequence of bright lights over Garden City, SC.;2012-06-14 21:00:00;10 minutes;Sequence of bright lights over Garden City, SC. Looking out over the ocean at dusk.  All of the sudden a bright orange light appeared in the sky, and a few seconds later another bright light appeared just to its left.  The two then vanished.  A few minutes later, far to the south, two more lights appeared for approximately 10 seconds then disappeared.  Five minutes later 3 lights appeared spread equidistant far accross the sky.  The were visible for approx. 5 seconds, then disappeared. No sound, no trails, no movement...only sequences of large, bright orange lights appearing and disappearing.  For a few minutes after some thought they saw smaller objects moving and communicating much higher up in the atmosphere, although this was tough to decipher.

Bright orange lights in the night sky.;2013-06-20 21:30:00;30 minutes;Bright orange lights in the night sky. We were sitting on the patio at about 9:30pm when my mother in law noticed a orange light brighter than any star in the sky offshore.  It went out like someone flipped a switch, reappeared flashing 2 x 3 times. Later we saw a larger orange ball light up following 4 additional smaller balls lit up one by one in a horizontal pattern almost like a string of beeds, they all went out at the same time only to reappear in the same way about 10 seconds later. 1 minute after that we first saw one ball light up again, then another and another until there was a row of 7 or 8 all together also in a horizontal pattern, after about 7 seconds they all disappeared, I tried to film it but my iPhone doesn't do very well filming in the dark so you can barely only see two of the lights in the video I shot. we sat out there and waited to see if they would reappear, after about 30 minutes we gave up. It was the most insane thing I have ever seen, our neighbors also said they had seen the same thing last year, I described what I saw to them and they replied quote:  Yup, that's exactly what we saw, now that you guys have seen it too we know we're not crazy.;33.5462;-79.0427999999996
Orange light larger and closer than a star appeared then disappeared 3 times over the ocean. Object did not move. 5 of us saw it.;2014-06-18 00:10:00;3 seconds;Orange light larger and closer than a star appeared then disappeared 3 times over the ocean.  Object did not move. 5 of us saw it. One orange light appeared for about 3 seconds approximately 20-30 degrees off the horizon and north a bit from our location on the deck of our beach rental near Marlin Quay Marina.   The light appeared 3 times within 10 minutes while 5 of us looked on. We also saw very small aircraft like white strobe lights moving in the vicinity of the object. Very well could have been planes but the orange light itself - very unexplainable by 5 intelligent non believers.

We know the two of us definitely saw 3-5 lights in linear pattern. Our specific account do differ slightly as I believe they went away;2020-08-12 22:30:00;15-45 secondss;We know the two of us definitely saw 3-5 lights in linear pattern.  Our specific account do differ slightly as I believe they went away simultaneously, while my wife believes they went out individually.  Either way the linear lights were there. We've pondered mentioning, but realized there is another report of seeing what we did. For you folks there is definitely others that witnessed what you did!  And we know there has to be more people, we too can't imagine others, it was simply too obvious and too early in evening for several beachfront folks not to see!;33.5462;-79.0427999999996
