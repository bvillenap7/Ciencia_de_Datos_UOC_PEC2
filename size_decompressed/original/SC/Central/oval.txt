Two silver balls sitting in clear sky for 2 minutes and gone at high speed in 5 seconds.;2013-06-30 18:30:00;2 minutes;Two silver balls sitting in clear sky for 2 minutes and gone at high speed in 5 seconds. I was on my way to work and was driving south on highway 93 near Central. I saw two silver/stainless steel orbs that looked to be the size of beach balls. They were just sitting still, side by side, in the clear blue sky. The balls were extremely smooth and very shiny. They did not give off any light, other than the sunlight reflecting off them, or sound. I saw them for approximately two minutes. Both objects began moving extremely fast toward the east, remaining side by side, and were out of sight in about five seconds. I told one of my coworkers and my wife about this event within an hour of the sighting.;34.7441;-82.7948
