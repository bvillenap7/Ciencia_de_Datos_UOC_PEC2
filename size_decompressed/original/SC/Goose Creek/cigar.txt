Reported this to ((Name deleted)) who researches privately here locally.  We wern't on the net then.  ((Name deleted)) is listed here in Summerville SC and own a business. We saw the cigar shaped object after coming home from the grocery store.  It was early evening not quite full darkness.  On the interstate it was about 11:30pm and clear.  I almost ran off the road looking and my husband was freaking.  I'm a finance manager for a auto dealer and he is a sales manager for the same dealer in sc.
