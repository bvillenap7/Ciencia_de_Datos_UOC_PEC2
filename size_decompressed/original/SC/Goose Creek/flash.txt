Brillant flashes of light;2010-02-12 21:00:00;15 minutes;brillant flash of light At approximately 2100 hours on february 12 my wife and i were laying in bed and we witnessed a brilliant flash through our blinds.  I got up and looked out the window to see a brillant green flash.  I ran around to my back yard and witnessed it 5 more times but could not pin point were the location of this flash was.   At that point I contacted the ufo report hotline and the operator told me that i should contact the authorities and possibly the electric company because it could be a transformer blowing out.  We were experiencing a freak snow storm that night and I contacted both the police department and the electrical department and they said they had no reports of either flashes of light or any surges of electrity or any power outages.   At that point I was at a loss for what it could possibly be. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be an exceptionally serious-minded individual.  He emphasized how bright the light was, and how many times the flash occurred, approximately 20 times.  PD));33.058;-80.0101000000002
