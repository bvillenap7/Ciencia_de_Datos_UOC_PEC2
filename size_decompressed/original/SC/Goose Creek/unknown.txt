3 orange lights, arrayed in a triangle formation, travelling across the sky near Charleston, SC.;2014-03-30 23:00:00;2 minutes;3 orange lights, arrayed in a triangle formation, travelling across the sky near Charleston, SC. At approximately 11:00 PM on March 30, 2014, I was about to retire for the night and realized that I had not taken the dog out before bed.   I walked out the door and after a few seconds, looked up at the sky, as it was a clear night.  I observed 3 orange lights, arranged in a triangle formation, travelling East at about 96* on the compass (checked later).   I noticed that there was absolutely no sound emanating from the lights.  It was very quiet outside and no sound could be heard at all.   I ran back into the house and grabbed my phone and was able to capture a few seconds of video.  However they had already travelled to a point that I was only able to capture the trailing light before they disappeared behind houses.   My house is on the flight line for the Air Force base and local airport, but they fly in on about 177* (S) heading and I always hear the props, jets or rotors.  I would estimate the height of the objects at around 2000 feet above the ground, but that would be 100% a guess.;33.058;-80.0101000000002
UFO with bright orange light with pencil like beams of light emitted from all sides.;2015-07-18 22:00:00;4 minutes;UFO with bright orange light with pencil like beams of light emitted from all sides. On July 18th at approximately 10 p.m. EST my mom and I were standing outside in my driveway and I looked up and saw a very bright orange colored light moving towards our direction.  I told my mom, that's not a plane.  We stood there without moving as the object came closer and it stopped moving several times and then would move slowly and then continue to speed up again.  We watched it until it went farther away and higher and the light became dimmer until it disappeared.  There was NO sound from an engine and my neighborhood was dead silent and you could have easily heard a pin drop.  No doubt in my mind that this was a UFO. About two minutes later we saw and heard a military plane take off and head towards the direction of the UFO.  The plane had a flashing white light and we both could hear the engine noise. It was impossible to tell what shape the UFO was because the orange glowing light was so bright and intense that all you could see was that bright orange light and what appeared to be lines of light emitting from all around the object almost like pencils circling around a circle.  Very strange and very exciting to see!!;33.058;-80.0101000000002
Three sets of hovering lights over Hwy 52 in Goose Creek, South Carolina.;2015-12-04 00:22:00;5-10 minutes;Three sets of hovering lights over Hwy 52 in Goose Creek, South Carolina. Ok so... Anyone who really knows me can probably tell you about how much of an extraterrestrial/ufo fanatic I am.  But not many know why... When I was 7, I was invited to a camp out at a buddies house for his birthday. Halfway through the night we look up in the sky to see two very distant lights chasing each other with UNBELIEVABLE speed and changing direction on a dime...  Things that planes can not do... That memory has stuck with my all my life and is the main reason why I find anything to do with aliens super interesting, but... I had not personally witnessed another UFO with my own eyes since then...  Until tonight... I stayed at work late to work on my car, nothing out of the usual.  I finished up and locked up the shop to head home.  So as I am making my way out of Goose Creek towards Moncks Corner, I notice 3 individual sets of lights in the sky.  As I got closer I noticed they didn't seem to be moving... AT ALL...  So naturally I think, no one's going to believe me, so I whipped out my phone and recorded the following video... (Insert Video). Video Description:  Three sets of lights hovered in the distance.  As I get closer the video quality improved.  I ride, pretty much right under the crafts and get a pretty detailed video of them.  As they passed over the car, and right as I stopped the video, I came to almost a complete stop and downed my window to find it almost completely silent… I never saw the objects again after they passed above my windshield horizon.  I tried to look back but they seemed to have vanished…;33.058;-80.0101000000002
Unidentified craft lit by dull orange light seemed to wobble silently through the sky.;2016-05-08 22:45:00;45 seconds;Unidentified craft lit by dull orange light seemed to wobble silently through the sky. I saw what I thought was a child's balloon that had flown away.  It was lit by a dull orange light and seemed to wobble through the sky.  I quickly realized that it was moving much too fast to be a balloon.  Before I could judge size or distance, it was already out of sight. It flew roughly south to north and two conventional aircraft were visible in the sky at the same time.  The unidentIfied aircraft made no sound.;33.058;-80.0101000000002
