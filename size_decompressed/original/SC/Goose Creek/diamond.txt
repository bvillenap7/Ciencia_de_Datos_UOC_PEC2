Object moved the full view of night sky in less than 60 seconds;2003-10-02 21:00:00;60 seconds;Object moved the full view of night sky in less than 60 seconds My daughter and I were out after dark when I spotted an object that was moving nw at an high altitude. I thought it was a falling star that had not entered the atmosphere yet. The object continued to move to the NW well above the aircraft in the area. This continued for approx. 30 seconds. The object made a short turn at a high rate of speed to the south unitl it was no longer visable. My daughter and I were both able to watch this event and were never able to come up with an explanation for the object.;33.058;-80.0101000000002

Diamond shaped with one side thinking back with LED like row of lights with circular lights in center;2013-11-07 18:30:00;20 minutes;diamond shaped with one side thinking back with LED like row of lights with circular lights in center I seen & then followed a UFO in Goose Creek, SC.  1st sighting on saint James Blvd. by Wall-Mart just above tree line moving about 10/15 mph traveling along right side of street going towards Red bank rd.  I seen this object as I was coming out of $ tree then @ light I turned right 2 follow.  This 1st view was like I was seeing it from the bottom @ an angle. Object had 4 red lights @ each pointed end of a diamond shape (I think).  I lost sight of it even pulling into Publics parking lot where I got out & tried 2 find object again but could not.  I only looked around 4 maybe 1min.  Then decided 2 turn back on Saint James to @ least follow the same path it was going toward b4 I lost it. When I got 2 the 5 light intersection I seen it across street in wooded area across from Wendy's moving toward north Charleston following along side Hwy 52.  All I can say is at this angle of view  Oh my God, this thing was huge and I was screaming.  It was like I was looking @ a back of this diamond shaped object, with either end having rows of round led looking lights with maybe 4 lines of round lights with 5 round lights in each row on either end & all white.  In the center was a circle of round white lights with a circle of smaller lights within.  The very center of this set of round lights in a circular shape was dark with no lighting and the rows of lights @ each end also had a gap of darkness between them.   There is no way I was the only person to see this thing @ that intersection!  I then turned on 52 & continued 2 follow while I did keep losing sight of it in the tree line as it traveled , I was able 2 see clearly again at that low bridge over swampy area b4 losing it again.  I decided to turn left @ the 1st light on rivers into that subdivision on Otranto between Stokes Honda & gas station.  See I had 2 turn around bc I live in Moncks Corner so what the hell I road back into this subdivision to try to find it again & did.  The 3rd & last time  I viewed this object that never seemed 2 move any faster then 10/15 mph was traveling over the lake/water area @ the very back of subdivision just going on its merry way toward Charleston.
