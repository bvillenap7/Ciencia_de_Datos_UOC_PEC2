Triangular Craft Flies Above Home and Goes Lights Off;2013-04-01 22:02:00;2 minutes;Triangular Craft Flies Above Home and Goes Lights Off Ok, so this is what I just saw fly over our house...I was joking with my roommate (he was in the kitchen and I was walking back to my room, when I passed by the window and saw the lights in the distance, and I said, &quotlook out the window and tell me if that's a UFO&quot...as it got closer, I could see that it was triangular, (see pics)...it had big white lights on the front of it, and two flashing white lights on the back ....and a red light in the middle....as I was joking out loud to my roommate, &quotyou better come and look it's going to land in the field next to us&quot...so I flashed our porch light, as if to get the attention of it....it flew right over us, and as it did, the lights when out, and only the red light was on, and I could clear see it was triangular.....by that time my roommate was in the back of the house...I looked online, and this is pretty much exactly what it looked like, other than how I described above....it actually had two ! more white lights on each side of the red light, but closer to the front...and it was those three, including the one on front that went out.;33.1962;-80.0245000000001
