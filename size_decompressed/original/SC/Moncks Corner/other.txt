What I heard was as if something very big & very hard hit the top of the porch-but there was nothing to be seen and no damage that we could see done to the porch.;33.1962;-80.0245000000001

Something resembling a rocket took off from the area the landfill is at. It's also a methane processing plant. I watched this rocket looking object shoot up. It released two smaller balls of blinking lights. Went further up and released another one. So three total. I had my girlfriend and her dad watch with me. It was kind of brief but I couldn't have been the only one who seen it. I've seen planes release contrails but this was not the same. If anyone else seen this event just know your not alone. I'm truly baffled.;33.1962;-80.0245000000001
