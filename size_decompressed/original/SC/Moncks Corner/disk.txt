When we were driving down the road I saw a spaceship and pointed it out to my brother and he got very excited and freaked out at the same time.  My grandma was talking on the phone and we were yelling from the back seat and grandma then hung up the phone.  It seemed like it was getting lower and lower.   My grandma then saw it and said Oh my gosh! and she was shocked as well.;33.1962;-80.0245000000001
