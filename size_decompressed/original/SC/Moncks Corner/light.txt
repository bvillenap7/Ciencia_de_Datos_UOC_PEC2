Red ball of light climbs to 15,000 ft, hovers, then fades out with no clouds in the sky.;2011-07-02 22:30:00;3 mins;Red ball of light climbs to 15,000 ft, hovers, then fades out with no clouds in the sky. My father and I were on our boat on Lake Moultrie to watch fireworks.  As we were heading back to the dock, we both saw a red-orange ball of light out of the south sky.  We see lights from aircraft all the time from the municipal airport, so we overlook lights in the sky, but this light was very bright, almost like a signal flare.   When first seen, this light was roughly 3000 ft in altitude.  We watched it for roughly 3 minutes all the while it was climbing in altitude straight up.  It reached about 15,000 ft, stopped climbing and hovered for 10 seconds, and then the light slowly faded out, which took another 10-20 seconds.   There wasn't ONE cloud in the sky.   All the evidence says a signal flare but it was too bright and signal flares and fireworks don't go to 15,000 ft in the air, they fade as they fall from the sky.;33.1962;-80.0245000000001

THE LITE WAS AS BRIGHT AS VENUS USUALLY IS, EXCEPT IT WAS 4-5 X LARGER!   I TOLD THE LADIES AT THE POOL I WAS AT TO LOOK UP!  WE WATCHED IT GO OVER AT A SLOW ARCH AND AS IT STARTED TO FADE FROM BRIGHT TO A RED AS IT FADED FOR ABOUT 8 SECOUNDS AND WENT OUT!  IT NEVER REACHED THE HORIZEN!  IF THE WEST WAS 3:00 AND EAST WAS 9:00 IT FADED AT ABOUT 11:00 OCLOCK!   OTHER PLANES WERE AROUND AND GOING BY BUT THEY ALL HAD STROBES,AND RED AND GREEN LIGHTS TO COMPARE WITH!   THIS WAS THE THIRD JULY NOT THE 4TH JULY, SO WE KNEW IT WASENT THE SPACE STATION!;33.1962;-80.0245000000001
A bright point of white light in the night sky that shot off into the horizon faster than anything I've ever seen.;2011-12-29 22:58:00;2 seconds;A bright point of white light in the night sky that shot off into the horizon faster than anything I've ever seen. I was driving down HWY 52 in Moncks Corner at Main Street in the direction of St. Stephen. I saw a bright point of white light appear in the sky, brighter than any star and from my pov, it was about the size of a penny.  It appeared very suddenly and just as suddenly it shot off as fast as it appeared. It moved so fast into the horizon that the point of light it started as was still there and it appeared as a long beam of light that went to a point, and the original point seemed to chase towards the point.

Large bright white light travels north east before disappearing.;2019-01-21 19:00:00;30 seconds;Large bright white light travels north east before disappearing. In my backyard letting the dogs out when I saw an incredibly bright glaring white light in the sky.  It was traveling East/North-East. I watched it for about 10 seconds before calling my husband to come see it.  We both watched it for another 15 seconds or so as it proceeded to dim before completely disappearing.  The size of the initial light seemed much larger than any plane or helicopter I’ve seen, and wasn’t blinking as planes and helicopters typically do, and definitely wasn’t a spot light either.   I’ve lived here for 2 years and spend a lot of time watching the skies.  Husband or I haven’t seen anything like this before.;33.1962;-80.0245000000001
