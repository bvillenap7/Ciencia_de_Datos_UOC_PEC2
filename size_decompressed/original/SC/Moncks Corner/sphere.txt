Bright red-orange sphere seen by homeowner from back yard.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch??  PD));2014-02-19 20:30:00;~20 seconds;Bright red-orange sphere seen by homeowner from back yard. While watching our new puppy in my back yard (facing south) a distant flicker of light caught my eye.  It was bright red to orange in color, appeared to be spherical in shape or emitting an intense light for its altitude.  The object moved much quicker than any other aircraft at high altitude that I have personally seen, a supersonic pace.  I tracked the object in a west/southwest to east/northeast movement losing the object behind cloud cover.  It appeared to have been above 25,000 ft, with an international airport/AFB 25 miles away I get to see a lot of air traffic at night.  I haven't seen anything like this before, I've seen meteors, many different types of fighter/bomber/cargo aircraft (USAF retired), missile tests at White Sands, civilian aircraft to include helicopters.;33.1962;-80.0245000000001
