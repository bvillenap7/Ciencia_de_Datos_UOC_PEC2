(approx.);The HugeBlur passed my field of view in no time flat, Like it was shot from a Very Big Gun. I was coming home from walmart one evening. I turned at the Unemployment Office and headed toward Hwy 72.  I crossed over the R.R. Trax and their is a good size field to the left. I always look to see the horses, but this time, I cought something out of the corner of my left eye.  I WATCHED as a Big Blur, flew right across my field of view and over the trees to my right. By the time I made it to the next clearing to my right, it was gone out of sight. It was maybe a few hundred feet from me, It was Aprox. 500' to 1000' from the ground. It was a hand and a halftall at arms lenght. It was as long or longer than my arm, held at arms lenght. It looked almost like, when you scramble someones face on tv, the blur you see. It was moving sooo fast! It took maybe 2to3 seconds for it to, with my head turned to the left then following it, go all the way across in front of me and over the trees to the right. Nothing can move that fast. But that did! I did not see any shape in the blur what so ever. It looked transparent as such. no color. Like what you would see if you hold someones very thick glasses up to the sky and look through one lens at a cloud. Just a blur. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.4706;-81.8751000000001
