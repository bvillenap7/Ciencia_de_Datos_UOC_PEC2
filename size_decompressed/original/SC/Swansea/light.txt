Bright white light that went below treeline close to Swansea S.C.;2010-05-09 22:07:00;15 mins;Bright white light that went below treeline close to Swansea S.C. Started off I saw it outside of North, S.C. driving on US 321 towards Woodford. It was pretty high in the sky at about my 10-11 o'clock. It was a very bright white light. Knew it wasnt a star but had no blinking lights that i could see. Then It got a little lower but what i really noticed is it started to become more parallel to me at my 9 o'clock so I knew I was right beside it. Past the hills on Woodford I started to notice it become even lower and go even past my 9. So I pulled over on this dirt road (lee witt rd), and I couldn't see it all. I had lost it in the trees before i turned of 321, then through the trees I noticed a outside light prob from a house and another brighter light, possibly the light itself, much lower now. So I did a 3 point turn and turned back to 321. Then I drove about 30 feet, killed the lights and got out, looking directly NE behind the truck. I saw it again!! Much lower prob 100 feet above the tree line in the distance. So I got! the flashlight,  and went into the field about 6-7 feet and could see it perfectly. Due NE, have no idea if it was 1-2-4 miles away b/c all it was white light. I swear for a sec i thought it had a searchlight on but it was like 1/2 sec only. It moved slowly down and then i could make out a redish not really blinking but tinge to the outside of the white light, on both sides. No sounds, nothing. And North air force was running manuvers toward the SE but they had just flown over and didn't even cross 321, way away from me. It just sat there and i watched it for prob 15mins as it just went behind the trees. I have Iphone video and pics but so far all it seems to have captured is darkness... Here is a google tag to exactly where I was standing.. http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.709095,-81.107557&num=1&t=h&sll=33.708945,- 81.107501&sspn=0.002231,0.003439&hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=33.710525,-81.107833&spn=0,0.003439&z=18&layer=c&cbll=33.709195,-81.107446&panoid=ZOpzLEwG1Wn1f01zs-QFBA&cbp=12,302.14,,0,1.6;33.7346;-81.0935
Long line of red lights across the sky.;2017-12-09 19:30:00;1 minute;Long line of red lights across the sky. There was a long line of red lights in sky.  They appeared to be in a straight line, as if hung on a wire across the sky.  There were no strobes or blinking lights.  I was driving, so I cannot estimate how many lights there were, but there were many!  They were not doing anything erratic or spectacular.  What caught our attention was simply their presence.  We could not ignore their abundance.  It was one of those, Wow!  Look at that moments!  They appeared from one end of the sky to the other.   We have never seen anything like this in the sky before.;33.7346;-81.0935
