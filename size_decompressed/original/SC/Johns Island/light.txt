Light floating above pasture;2008-05-07 20:00:00;5 minutes;Light floating above pasture I was out in my horse pasture waiting for the vet to come because my mare was having some major breathing problems. I remember sitting on another one of my horses when I looked up into the sky and saw an approaching light. There were no flashing lights and the light was pure white. It was moving as if it was a helicopter, but as it got closer, I saw that it wasnt. As it got above my pasture I freaked out and jumped off my horse and got into my truck, because it wasnt slowing down and kept getting lower. I took off and drove back to my house which is about a quarter mile away from my pasture, and when I turned around as I was driving through the gate, the light was about 20 feet above ground and I could clearly tell it was ONLY a floating light. When I drove back to my house I told my parents what had happened. They went back to check out what happened (I did not go because I was too freaked out), and my mother reported seeing the light but it was hovering over my sick horse, and then just floated away. I knew it was something that must have come from somewhere else...that was definately not some airplane or anything like that. I am a no nonsense kind of person, so this is not something I just made up for fun. This is real and the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

UFO sighting over Johns Island moving toward Charleston;2008-06-19 21:50:00;1 minute;UFO sighting over Johns Island moving toward Charleston I seen a star streaking across the sky.  It looked like a star.  Only it moved at a rate that could not be a plane and was slow enough not to be a falling star.  It was east bound toward Charleston.  From my vantage point, it was over the intercoastal waterway.   I seen it from my home in gift Plantation on Johns Island.;32.7863;-80.1055000000001
UFO sighting then fades away slowly over Johns Island;2010-06-24 23:42:00;5 seconds;UFO sighting then fades away slowly over Johns Island This craft, from my vantage point, was right off the right side of the Big Dipper.  It looked like a star.  It started moving east and away from the brightest bottom star of the Dipper.   After traveling slowly away from the dipper, it turned it's light off.  It disappeared.  It seemed as though it hit it's own dimmer switch as the light faded from it gradually.  It didn't just blink off.  Which makes me wonder, if they wanted to be covert, why shine like a star in the first place if not to gain attention???  BTW:  This is my second sighting in a week!!  ! I must be the luckiest guy alive!  Glad it didn't stop at my place! ((NUFORC Note:  No Iridium satellites visible from this location, on the date, and at the time, indicated.  ISS was visible in the northwestern sky, but at 23:14 hrs.  PD));32.7863;-80.1055000000001
