The pads/cushions did not appear metallic. So to recap: At first we saw a fiery/glowing orb but as it came closer I saw the craft itself which had the general shape of a 3-dimensional Chevrolet logo with 4 (2 red, 2 green)pads on the front. The craft emitted amber/red/green lights. As far as my background I have been in the military for 16 years and 2 overseas deployments.  I have seen flares and a wide variety of aircraft before.  This thing was defying physics/gravity.  This craft was unlike ANYTHING I've ever seen before and I am extremely grateful to have witnessed it.;32.7897;-79.7702
