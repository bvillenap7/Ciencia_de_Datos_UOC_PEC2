photographed white disk with red light on top/center;2003-10-09 03:45:00;1 minute;photographed white disk with red light on top/center latitude 32.47.825'N longitude 079.46.724'W  It was almost 4am and I was leaving for a long weekend before noon, so I emailed you the photo and a very short note prior to my departure. I just returned home last night and am now filing a siting report. I was outside on our second story porch having a cigarette. Looking northeast, fairly high in the sky, I was distracted by quick movements of an object lower in the sky. I tend to have my camera always nearby, but since I was packing for a trip, I happened to have it, extra battaries, a memory card, etc. in a case in the pocket of my robe! I quickly pulled it out, turned it on, held it up facing the area in the sky where I had detected movement, took a flash picture, and got the enclosed image. The image I previously emailed you (the night of the event), is the exact same image zoomed and cropped.;32.7897;-79.7702
Black disk occasionally flipping completely over as it moved across sky;2018-07-04 20:45:00;3-5 minutes;Black disk occasionally flipping completely over as it moved across sky Family member pointed out a black disk that flipped over completely as it moved across the sky.  The rest of us looked and saw the same thing.  It was so high in the sky that it would be hard to point out immediately, but could be followed through the sky once pointed out.  It disappeared behind clouds blocking view, but could be seen after passing by, and then became too tiny due to distance to continue watching.  This was on the beaches of Isle of Palms, SC, about 15-20 minutes before fireworks started.;32.7897;-79.7702
