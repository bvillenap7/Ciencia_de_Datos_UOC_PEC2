At around 8 PM 3 of us, myself included, decided to go out on the screen porch for a while and eat dinner there.  I noticed a large red sphere completely still in the sky,  I mentioned it to my cousins that it migth be the planet mars.  We agreed it seemed much brigther than usual.  A few minutes later we looked up and it seemed much closer to us.  I commented that No planet could moove like that in such a short time.  It began to move again, slowly at first like an airplane then much faster similiar to a shooting star w/o the tail,then it got brigther and completely vanished.  We looked across the sky to see if it had moved somewhere else.  We couldn't find it anywhere.;32.7897;-79.7702
