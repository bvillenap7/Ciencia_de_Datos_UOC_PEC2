white, chevron shaped.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Venus.  PD));2007-09-08 07:00:00;20 minutes;white, chevron shaped I am a 50 year old female investor. College graduate.  Attaching 4 photographs.  Went to bed late. Got up early and noticed as I looked south that the same bright “star” I’d seen the night before was still in the same spot. Within a couple minutes the “star” began sporadically moving, stopping in the east sky. The sun was just coming up but had not yet impaired my vision. It immediately became clear that the object was no longer star-shaped, but more V-shaped. It was white, like a wisp of cloud. I watched for about 20 minutes as it appeared to alternately thrash about, then float. After those 20 minutes  it’s movements stabilized and it moved toward the east and gradually upward.  I took several photographs and did not notice until reviewing them that there was a second object below and slightly south of the other.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Venus.
