Me, my husband and our 3 kids ages 16, 11 &7 were driving home to myrtle beach from north Charleston....it was somewhere between isle of palms and Georgetown on 17 that we saw them...actually I saw these lights first over the trees on my side of the road (inland side) I saw 3 looked away and looked back (because I was driving) and there was 1 and I looked away and back again but then there was nothing and I asked them if they saw what I was but they said saw what?  So I said nevermind..later down the road I was them again but over the trees on the other side of the road (ocean/marsh side)...and this time my family saw it...it was 1 large sphere (it was big and round) and then another appeared in front of it but smaller...then the big one disappeared and another appeared a little further away and then they were all gone....there was no sign of a tail or anything or any kind of shooting up look...nothing like a firework or flare or anything I have ever seen before....we didn't hear any sounds or anything either.;32.7897;-79.7702

On about the 5th or 6th of August, 2019, my wife and I went to the beach to observe meteors and we both saw out over the ocean two different times within a ten minute timespan five orange glowing orbs which looked to be pretty high above the ocean.  They seemed to come on in succession and fade out. There were no ships nearby.;32.7897;-79.7702
