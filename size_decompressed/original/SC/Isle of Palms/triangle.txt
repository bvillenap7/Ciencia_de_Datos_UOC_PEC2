Triangular shape with orange lights moving slowly towards ocean, then disappearing.;2011-11-24 19:00:00;5-7 min;triangular shape with orange lights moving slowly towards ocean, then disappearing. under a clear sky, I looked up and saw two orange round non-blinking lights.  One was behind the other a bit staggered and as I watched, the rear light turned towards the ocean.  I continued to watch the other orange light moving slowly towards Charleston, and I noticed a triangular shape..the orange light on the front tip.  It was flying extremely low, yet absolutely no sound, and the shape was very clear.  As I watched for about another minute or so, the object veered towards the ocean as well.  The orange light slowly began to dissipate and after ten seconds or so, it just disappeared completely out of sight.  There were no clouds as far as I could see.  It just disappeared.  I looked up higher to see if I could see more, then saw the blinking lights of an airplane coming the opposite way where the object disappeared.  Not five seconds later, I saw a beautiful shooting star!;32.7897;-79.7702
