Sunday night, July 3, three of us were sitting on the back porch and witnessed a fiery circular object come above the tree line from the Atlantic and move steadily in a north west direction.   It made no sound and moved at a steady rate of speed.  There were no erratic movements there were no running lights, no aircraft shape nor vapor trail.   The color was that of a red sun setting on the horizons but about 1/10 the size and fuzzy borders as opposed to a clearly circular shape.   It was about 2500/3500 feet up.  We have lived on bases all our working life and have never witnessed such an aircraft.   We called the Air Force in Charleston to report.  So glad someone else saw this!;32.7897;-79.7702
