I had just come out of the family dollar and was putting some power steering fluid in my pickup. Just then I saw a fireball or something falling due east (it look like it was just a few miles away.  There were military jets high in the sky (a normal sight for my area).  I thought it was a downed plane.  There was one other guy that saw it and walked over to me to ask me if I saw it.  I picked up my wife and we tried to drive to the spot where it looked like it fell without success.  I didn't think it was anything supernatural or unexplainable.  I just wanted to find out what happened.;34.4125000000001;-79.3804999999997
