However, the glowing trail could be observed, looking like a glowing worm for at least a few minutes longer. Then nothing but pitch black sky could be seen. There was no sound at all. No vibration at all. and no electrical problems were noticed. This was seen from a car as we drove past the I-95 bridge and went towards the coast. I am e-mailing a map of the area for clarification. I am a registered nurse. I have never seen such an object in my life. My mother also saw this and even drew a pictue of it when we reached our destination. There was a nearby airport perhaps they could have seen this on their radar. Whatever it was was burning up, slowly, as it traveled.;34.4125000000001;-79.3804999999997
