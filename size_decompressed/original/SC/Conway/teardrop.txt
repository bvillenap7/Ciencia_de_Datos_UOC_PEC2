I've never seen anything like it but it made noise it was moving faster than an airplane and it didn't have any flashing lights especially that red one you see on helicopters and airplanes.  I've never seen anything like it.  The speed of it and the shape were odd and the way it just vanished was incredibly odd.  I'm more than positive I just witnessed my first UFO.;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
