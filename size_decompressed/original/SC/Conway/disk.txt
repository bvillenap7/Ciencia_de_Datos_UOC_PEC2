Reporting for a neighbor who does not have computer access:  My dad and I were getting ready for work when my mother called us outside to see a meteor shower.  Both of us came out and saw the lights but realized it was not a meteor shower but lights blinking on and off in a stationary position.  The three of us continued to stare at the object.  There was not a sound coming from it. I sent my dad in to get a pair of binoculars and we looked at the object carefully with them.  We discovered the lights were not blinking on and off as we thought but were dimming and then brightening.  When they were dim you could not see them with the naked eye.  The lights circled a disk shaped black mass that seemed to create a void space in the sky yet at times it seemed almost transparent.  It was saucer shaped with the lights on the perimeter. All of the lights appeared to be white there was one white light on the top as we were able to view it as it left.   After about ten to twelve minutes the object started to move directly north toward town.  It moved slowly with no sound. It looked like it just floated away. Since there was nothing to use as a reference I would guess it was between 50' and 100' in diameter.  As it moved north, it appeared to be almost at tree top level around 60' to 100' and the body seemed to turn translucent looking like a frosted glass.   Total time viewed was about fifteen to eighteen minutes.;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
