My wife, a friend and myself we're traveling down E 501.  We saw four lights forming a horizontal line across the sky.   They were evenly spaced and seemed to be stationary as they begun flashing vigorously and then went out one by one from right to left.  White light;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
3 orange lights followed by 5 blue/white flashing lights rotating across the sky;2016-12-01 18:45:00;5 minutes;3 orange lights followed by 5 blue/white flashing lights rotating across the sky Walking my dog...Difficult to calculate how many craft as I first saw 3 orange lights appear toward the east...  Two on the right side of the night sky perpendicular to each other and one quite far off to the left.  These lights appeared for about 5 seconds then all 'turned' off simultaneously until there was no light in the sky other than stars.  The dog stopped and looked up to seem to see the lights as well.  When that event was over I took dog in house and told family member.  Went back outside to close my car windows and suddenly saw a series of blue flashing lights.  These were toward the north and were a series of 5 or 6 rotating lights that also flashed as they rotated across the sky.  I ran in to get two family members who also witnessed these lights.  We watched until 3 or 4 of them disappeared but 3 more continued to rotate in the sky and appear to move off to the east... the we saw a fast moving plane head toward the lights and the blue/white lights quickly disappeared.... this event with the blue/white rotating lights lasted about 3-5 minutes.  There was no noise with these events other than the airplane that eventually came into area;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415

It rotated and maintained that shape while seeming to rotate along a perfect path.  These orbs were about the distance of a low flying helicopter.  Much too large to be drones.  As it rotated, each orb disappeared one by one and it was gone.;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
