Orange balls of light going from beach area toward Loris area, seen from downtown Conway.;2014-07-07 20:45:00;1.5 minutes;Orange balls of light going from beach area toward Loris area, seen from downtown Conway. I was heading toward the beach on business 501 in downtown Conway just before the bridge over the waccama river around 8:40 pm when I saw about 7-9 glowing orange balls of light move from directly in front of my vehicle and covered a space of ninety degrees as heading to Loris direction so as to end up on my left side before they disappeared.   They were in a weird formation that did not change as they flew by, and kept same spacing the whole time.   This is not my first time seing these orange  balls of light, I had seen them about a half a year ago as well, so this would interest if we can figure out what they are.;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
2 orange stationary pulsating spheres then 5 smaller orange spheres moving irratically not pulsating with no sound;2021-05-11 22:00:00;9 minutes;2 orange stationary pulsating spheres then 5 smaller orange spheres moving irratically not pulsating with no sound On May 11, 2021 at 10:00 pm, I stepped out on my back porch for a second. I looked up and over the two story house facing west behind mine because something caught my eye. I saw two pulsating, glowing orange stationary spheres, one a bit lower than the other, as if they were floating. I watched for about fifteen seconds and then looked away to call my husband to come immediately. When I looked back they were gone. They made no sound at all. When my husband got outside I told him what I had seen. We waited about eight minutes and they reappeared again, but they were across Hwy 701 South and there were five of the orange spheres. One of these spheres then darted from right to left towards another one at a very high rate of speed and stopped just as quickly without touching the other sphere. On a clock the movement would have been from two to eight o'clock. No sound. Not pulsating or stationary and then disappeared. Within minutes a low flying plane flew over w! ith bright white landing lights on heading west to east towards Myrtle Beach International Airport. FAA tower supervisor was not able to tell me if any radio traffic confirmed my sighting. Will file a freedom of information application with the FAA. This occurred near a power company solar farm and high voltage power lines.;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
