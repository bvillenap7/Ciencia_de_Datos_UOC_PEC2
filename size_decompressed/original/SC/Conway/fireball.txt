9 bright orange fireballs falling to the ground from the sky...;2015-01-31 21:30:00;5 minutes;9 bright orange fireballs falling to the ground from the sky... I was on my way to the Kangaroo Refuel gas station off of Millpond Rd. in Conway.  As I was driving I looked to the sky and saw 9 bright orange/red orbs falling slowly from the sky.   They seemed to be very close to earth, to the point where they continued to fall to the ground beyond the trees until they were no longer in my sight.  They were in a line, yet not straight, they curved, some lower or higher than the others.;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
