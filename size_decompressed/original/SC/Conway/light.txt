3 or 4 lights in circular or triangular pattern with one trailing behind  ((NUFORC:  Satellites?  PD));2004-09-19 21:25:00;8 seconds;3 or 4 lights in circular or triangular pattern with one trailing behind, and on trailing behind and to the side I was lying in my hammock, watching and counting satellites goin over.  I saw two satellites close together following the same path from south to north.  The rear satellite started glowing brightly at about 60 degrees from the horizon, which I thought was odd because I didn't notice the first one doing this.  It almost looked as if something was shining a bright light on it for about 2 or 3 seconds.  About 30 seconds after they were no longer visible, an object(s) came from the north going south.  My first thought was a meteor, but then realized there were several lights.  Second thought was an airplane, but it was moving very quickly, seemed to be high up, and seemed to be very large.  There was a cluster of three or four lights, different colors but not sure what, followed by two small lights.  One light following was directly behind the cluster, the other was off to the side and rear.  This one appeared reddish.  There was no noise and it was moving too quickly to be a normal jet.  The following night at the same time, 9:25 PM, I saw two orangish lights following each other from directly overhead, curving around south and then quickly to the west.  They were gone in one or two seconds.  Possible search lights from the Myrtle Beach Airport, however there were no clouds in the sky to reflect off of. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed an Iridium satellite.  Just a guess.  PD));33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
Fast red light with three bangs.;2013-04-27 00:43:00;1-2 seconds;fast red light with three bangs i stepped outside onto my front porch to smoke a cigarette.  my attention was drawn to a bright red light assending very rapidly in the sky, almost like a shooting star. the visual only lasted for a second or two, and when it disappeared i heard what was similar to three gun shots. the sounds seemed like they were at ground level towards where i first seen the light above the tree line. then all thee dogs in the area barked for about five minutes.  i was shocked and puzzled at the same time.  i tried to think about what i just seen, and no it was not a firework. any explanations?

Bright light moving across the night sky.;2014-03-19 23:15:00;1:30 seconds;Bright light moving across the night sky. A bright illuminating light rising 95 degrees north, then proceeded across the sky to 110 degrees south east.   Then the light vanished disappearing from the night sky.   The light was low as if it was an air craft, but their was no beacons or flashing light.  The light was a constant stream of emitting light.  There were no sounds and it was moving at a constant rate of speed for 1:25 sec to 1:30 sec then it vanished right before my eyes. The light was not moving at a high rate of speed, but very slowly and steadily before vanishing.   It is a very clear night no clouds, and or fog, and the moon was out making it very bright out.  Not only on the ground, but in the sky.;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
Small light appeared with a flash dimming down moved around in a curving manner faded away then brightened and reappeared;2014-06-17 22:15:00;4 minutes;Small light appeared with a flash dimming down moved around in a curving manner faded away then brightened and reappeared Small light appeared with a flash in the night sky, dimming down to a normal brightness within the second it appeared.   It moved around in an odd, curving or circular manner far off in the distance over the downtown historic Conway area.  It seemed to dim and fade completely away at one point, but then brightened back to being visible.  It was in an area where planes don't normally fly.  There is an airport near where I work in Myrtle Beach, and I see huge low flying planes about to land there every day while driving so I know where they fly.  They also fly in extremely low since they're about to land so they are extremely visible.   But this craft was far off in the distance over the historic downtown Conway area most likely, and seemed very small but also bright for such a small craft.;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
Conway sc, bright star like light but not a star moving slowly through the sky!;2017-01-28 21:00:00;Days;Conway sc, bright star like light but not a star moving slowly through the sky! Looks like a bright star!!  But it is no star!!  Zigzags in the sky and moves very slowly.  You would think it was a star or planet but it seems to be way too low to the earth to be a planet.  We thought it was a plane but it made no sound and no flashing lights and in the video u can see other planes and such flying and they were no comparison!  The first night we saw it was two nights ago.  It was in the exact same spot and was green (video)!!  Tonight, same spot same movements, but it looked like it was orange for a moment then had a hint of green every now and then.  There is a star in the background and you can tell that whatever it is is moving away from the star and is obviously not supposed to be there!;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
