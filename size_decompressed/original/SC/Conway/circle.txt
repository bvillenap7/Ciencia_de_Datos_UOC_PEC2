White light much larger and simply vanised We puller into our dirt drive on our farm and immediately saw three Red-Orange globes circling each other at a random rate,each indepent of the other. Got out of car and watched this show,  They appeared to be between 500 and 800 feet off the ground and about 500 feet away.  I flashed a high power Mag lite at them and the show stopped, NO SOUND WAS HEARD EXCEPT FOR DOGS BARKING LIKE CRAZY.  I again turned the light on two or three times in session and a BRIGHT LIGHT appeared slightly farther away from the initial sitting lasting a couple of seconds,  The intensity of this light was brighter than an aircraft landing light at extremely close range;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
