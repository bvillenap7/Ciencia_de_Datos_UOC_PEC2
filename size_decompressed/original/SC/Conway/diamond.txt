I saw an object that resembled a plane but it wasn't because it hovering about 2 to 300 feet of the ground.  It was too big to be a helicopter. The object seen resembled a plane but wasn't because it hovering of the ground say about 2 to 300 feet.  It was to large to be a helicopter.  It has 4 visible white lights two of which were shining off into the distance.  The other two were just lit up.   I also saw a smaller green and red light.   The shape of the object appeared to be the it had some sort of wings or maybe it was a diamond shape but I could not see in between the lights.

Very large craft that I thought at first was an airplane.  But moved too slow, even seemed to stop at one point, and was HUGE.  Then saw move sideways, very low in the sky, and took a path no plane has taken to airport in this areas.  Had what appeared to be three lights at first, but when moved to side, could see at least 4 lights and they light up bottom side of biggest thing in the sky I have ever seen.  It seemed very close to me and made an odd, low rumbling noise, but not very loud, and did not sound like airplane engines.;33.8579959183673;-79.07048537415
