Driving to Florida, a green sphere in  the sky free falls, then curves upward, then disappears;2009-02-15 05:30:00;8 seconds;Driving to Florida, a green sphere in  the sky free falls, then curves upward, then disappears I am a 27 year old family man on a vacation to florida when my girlfriend, her cousin and I were driving South on I95 in South Carolina, in or around a surrounding town of Manning, when we saw one bright sphere that looked like a cosmic, foggy, neon green flare. It first looked like a shooting star, then started pretty much free falling from right to left, then slightly curved upward, then started accelarating up, then just faded like a burned out matchstick. It almost looked just like the texas fireball, but slightly smaller. We thought when we saw the Texas fireball news report that it was the same one, until we looked at the times, and they did not match up. The texas fireball was at approximetly 11:00a.m texas time, which is about noon in South carolina. This incident happend approx. 6.5 to 7 hours earlier which would be around 5 to 5:30 A.M. in south carolina. please contact me via E-Mail.;33.6183000000001;-80.2125999999999
