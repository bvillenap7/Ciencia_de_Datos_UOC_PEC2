It was iridescent orange and crimson red balls of pure energy about 10x larger and brighter than a star with no tail, trails, or place of origin (except some energy trails leaping from the ground to sky near Andrews).   There were three in almost in a triangle type formation initially, with the bottom two then sequencing and splitting to form 5 lights in total with 4 on the bottom and 1 up above.  The two on the bottom had the one light on the right side move (rather slide) horizontly and then split to form the rest.  It was literally insane.   When I pulled out my camera they blinked out of existence only to come back a few minutes later closer and in a similar yet different formation with the bottom two sliding across the sky to replicate into 5.  It was incredible.  Almost unbelievable but mt dad saw it too.  I pointed it out to him.  There was very strange lightning on th! e horizon.  Lighting upwards and very red and ominous.  Though there was no cloud cover where we saw the balls of energy, or lightning, or plasma, or whatever on earth or heaven this was.  They moved fluidly, they also all disappeared instantaneously at the same time at the end of both instances.  Absolutely no sound and they moved like fluid energy.  Very alluring orange and red, gorgeous yet ominous.  Amazing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.4308000000001;-79.3235000000003
3 orange fireballs.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-24 18:15:00;2 minutes;3 orange fireballs in a triangle shape.  They broke formation and moved through the sky.  They would blink off and re appear a short distance from original location.  Then seemed to almost collide or re form triangle and disappeared.   I was driving through Pleasant Hill community, and noticed them in the sky towards Georgetowns direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
