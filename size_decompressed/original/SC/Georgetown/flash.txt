2-3 Bright fireball lights in sky which fade slowly on and off.;2015-07-30 23:00:00;5 minutes;2 to 3 Bright fireball lights in sky which fade slowly on and off While I was outside in the country part of town stargazing cause stars are more visible away from the town lights.  I seen 3 red fireball lights.  2 was close together and the third was further out, almost made a triangle shape.  As one light would fade off slowly the second close one would appear and then slowly fade.   Then it is unable to be seen for a minute and would appear again a little across the sky.  Appeared very low cause lights were a third brightness of the moon.   Very weird and exciting.  I will be looking at same time tomorrow.;33.4308000000001;-79.3235000000003

I went outside and captured the lights dashing around in the western sky.  I captured the activity on my cell phone through Facebook Live.  We live in a rural area and saw this once before, several years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  We just received this report over our UFO Hotline.
