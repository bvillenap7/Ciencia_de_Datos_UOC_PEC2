At approximately 20:00 on Dec. 18, 2008 I heard loud jet roar over house which is very unusual in this vicinity, especially at night.   I went outside to investigate and saw what I am positive was a military fighter jet (I am ex-U.S. Air Force) flying fast, low to ground and making very tight turns.  The jet kept circling for approximately 45 minutes over vicinity of Sampit (10 miles from Georgetown).  I would guess that jet was flying no higher than 2000 ft., which I thought was very strange.  I saw no other aircraft or other objects in the sky.  Partly cloudy weather, 60 degrees, no precip, light wind. I would not have reported this activity if I had not seen 2 reports the next day at: www.myrtlebeachonline.com  Titled, Falling bright lights puzzle state officials, and Reports of downed plane linked to meteor shower..;33.4308000000001;-79.3235000000003
