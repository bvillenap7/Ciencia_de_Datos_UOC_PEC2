Triangular shape over Georgetown, early 1980's;1981-09-15 06:30:00;-3 min;triangular shape over Georgetown, early 1980's I can't remember the exact year that I saw the craft, I do remember that I was at least 8 or 9 years old, so I'm guessing it was around 1981-82. I remember standing at the end of our driveway waiting on the school bus.  It was early, 6:30ish, I also remember that it was overcast outside, whether it was cloud cover or fog, I do not know.  The weather was mild, maybe spring or early fall. I remember looking up for some reason or other and seeing something in the sky hovering no more than a few feet over the trees.  It was almost like it was using the clouds or fog as a camouflage.  I never heard any sounds or felt any breeze or wind from any aircraft type vehicle.  The aircraft that I saw was shaped like a rounded triangle with red and blue lights, I can not remember if they were flashing or solid.  The color of the entire thing was silver, not like stainless, more of a brushed nickle color. Being that I was a young child at the time, I was terrified and ran back into my house to get my Grandmother.  By the time we got back outside so I could show her what I saw, it was gone. My mom's house is no where near any Air force bases or airports, so it couldn't be passed off as any type of experimental airplane. I haven't seen anything like that since that day.  Although my children have often told me of unusual things they see in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is unknown.  Source indicates both early '80's, and the early '90's.

Possible sighting over Georgetown, South Carolina, December 4th, 2017.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-04 17:00:00;5 seconds;Possible sighting over Georgetown, South Carolina, December 4th, 2017 As I’m traveling passenger side from Conway to Charleston.  What first caught my attention were about 7 airplanes around the same area, normal but still something to look at.   As I continue to ponder at those planes an object sort of just appeared, I must have blinked because one second it wasn’t there and the next it was.  It resembled that of a scalene triangle.  Reflecting sun light tremendously.   It was gone as fast as it came. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
