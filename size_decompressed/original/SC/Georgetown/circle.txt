I went out on the porch to smoke around 8 p.m.  I saw a cluster of lights in the sky, over to the west.  Or maybe it was one light jumping around.  I thought it wad from the Air Force base.  But you know, airplane lights are not like that.  If you want to see the video, it can be viewed at: https://m.Facebook.com/story.pip?;33.4308000000001;-79.3235000000003
