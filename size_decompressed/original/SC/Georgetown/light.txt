There was a light in the sky that changed colors at random times, no pattern.;2015-08-28 06:00:00;1 hour;There was a light in the sky that changed colors at random times, no pattern. I was awoken by my grandfather around 6:00am, telling me to come out side quick.  When I went outside he said look is that thing moving and flashing red and green I said yes.   I stood out side for a hour while this light or object flashed, and it seemed to sway side to side at times.   I was also freaked out by the fact that I witnessed two shooting stars about three minutes apart around this object or light.
