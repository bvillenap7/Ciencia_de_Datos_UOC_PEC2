Orange lights triangular in shape.;2015-12-26 19:30:00;5 minutes;Orange lights triangular in shape. Around 1930 I was contacted to come outside and look towards the skyline, there were four orange lights/orbs that were moving.   My friend, who contacted me to come outside, said that a few moments earlier there were several others visible.    At this moment, three to four additional orange lights appeared below the four lights.  The lower lights were rotating in a triangular shape.   We called my grandmother to come out to see this event.   The orbs slowly disappeared.;35.1092;-82.1441
