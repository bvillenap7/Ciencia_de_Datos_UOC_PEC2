((anonymous report));2017-01-10 21:40:00;<1 minute;Driving from Carvers Bay high school to Hemingway, I looked up to see three lights out of my drivers window.  These lights were elongated egg shaped approx. 25 feet long and hovering.  As quickly as they appeared they disappeared.  I thought they went behind a cloud then they reappeared.  I rolled my window down to get a better look and one after the other took off.  I was able to catch another quick glimpse as I was reaching for my cell phone to take a picture.  No sonic boom no airplane or jet noises. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.7395;-79.4455
