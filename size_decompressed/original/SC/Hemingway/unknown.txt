I went outside around 9pm and noticed a strange orange light near the west.  I first thought it was a planet but upon further observation, noticed that more of these lights were coming from this one light in a straight pattern.  There was also another light farther away from these other lights about an arms length moving just above the tree tops. There was a total of four lights.  One by one the lights disappeared in the order in which they started. I thought the show was over but a few seconds later, I saw the fastest streak shoot across the sky not once but twice in different directions.  Each one was a few seconds apart.  Whatever those things were, they werent man made things.  Man hasn't made anything that moves as fast as those things moved.
