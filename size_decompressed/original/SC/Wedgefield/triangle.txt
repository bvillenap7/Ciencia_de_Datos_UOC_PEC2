Traingle or 3 separate crafts in triang. formation over AFB bombing range.;1997-09-15 19:00:00;15 min;Traingle or 3 separate crafts in triang. formation over AFB bombing range. My boyfriend saw this but will not report it himself.  Was in forest on Air Force base Bombing Range.  Looked up after eerie feeling and saw huge craft either traingle in shape or a formation of three crafts in triangle.  Lights alternated bright white to purple.  Moved very slowly -- took approx. 15 mins. to pass over him.  Was extremely scared, even to breathe.  He's been in air force family all of his life and also AIR Force ROTC high school & part college.  What scared him most was that it made absolutely no noise of any kind.  This was how he knew it was no ordinary aircraft or military craft.  He has never told anyone but myself about this and it took him several days afterward to tell me what he saw, and gets chills (his words) when I bring it up.;33.897;-80.5001
