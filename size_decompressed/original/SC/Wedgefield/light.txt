Entourage of pairs of lights which changed to single file, then leaped up toward the sky.;2002-05-23 23:00:00;3 min.;Entourage of pairs of lights which changed to single file, then leaped up toward the sky. We were camping here in SC in Poinsette State Park not 20 miles from our home.   I was sitting up front in our motorhome, around midnight, and watching for the wild dogs said to be roaming at night.  As I looked on about 200 yards beyond me, I could see what, at first, looked like the lights of the ranger's truck, but them there seemed to be an entourage of vehicles going along quite fast.  I yelled for my husband to look and he was looking and we saw the pairs of lights in the entourage change to single and go up into the sky. They seemed to go directly upward, then dissappeared.   When leaving the park the next day, we could see that the area where the lights were , was a big field. We have been thinking about that ever since.  This was on the night of May 23rd, 2002. Have you heard of any other sightings such as this? Thank you,;33.897;-80.5001
