i saw a ufo!!!;2010-03-22 10:20:00;9 min;i saw a ufo!!! Ok, at around 10:20pm, Tuesday, March 22, 2010, I was outside walking my dogs.  From the moment I stepped outside, my dogs were acting jittery, and I too felt like I was being watched. So I looked around at my surroundings, and saw no one. Then as I started to mumble to myself that it was probably just nothing, I heard like a whirring kind of noise. So I rechecked the area and no one was in sight, that is until I looked up. In the sky maybe 90 feet over, and above my head I saw the believed UFO. I stared at it in silence, and disbelief  for a few minuets when my dogs got worse.  It looked like a round disked, circle shape, with a rounded hump, or top, on the surface of the aircraft. Outlining the shape of the bottom surface, were glowing, no flashing red, and yellow-orange lights. It was flying in a downward angle as if to land in the vast abandoned cow-field not so far away. So I ran inside and asked my sister’s boyfriend if they (humans), had designed a mo! del like the one described above.  He simply shook his head and said no.  I was scared, and shocked. I had never believed in said “aliens”, or “UFO’s”, until that Tuesday night, that I saw a horrifyingly real, UFO, or alien aircraft.  I had never expected to see one, in all my life, and especially not in my own yard, flying, too low to be permitted to pilots from this world, above my head!;34.6602;-82.2435999999999
