Bright white light ,non flashing,leading in front of two airliners.;2005-01-25 00:00:00;30 seconds;Bright white light ,non flashing,leading in front of two airliners. We were outside taking a smoke break and were watching aircraft fly in to the Greenville/Spartanburg Airport when i noticed two airplanes about 45 seconds apart.At the first glimpse i noticed a single bright light in front of the lead aircraft.The light was much brighter than the beacon lights of the aircraft viewed.My friends said it was another airplane but that could not be true because if it was it would have collided with the first plane.Also i compared the flashing beacon lights with the stationary object several times and and could tell there was a distinct difference in the two.The object followed the two planes until they were out of sight but kept in a strait path until rising up out of sight.My friends concluded that it was an additional beacon light but if that were true the plane would have to be an enormous one,and one that could not land at that airport.This is not the first time i have witnessed unexplained objects in the day and night sky.;34.6602;-82.2435999999999
Point of light rapidly moves across the sky then fades away.;2014-04-24 21:00:00;10 seconds;point of light rapidly moves across the sky then fades away A bright pinpoint resembling a star moved horizontally across the sky in about 10 seconds then faded away in about 3 seconds. It began due southwest and disappeared due south at about 60 degrees above the horizon. I think it was between 8-10 pm EST.;34.6602;-82.2435999999999
