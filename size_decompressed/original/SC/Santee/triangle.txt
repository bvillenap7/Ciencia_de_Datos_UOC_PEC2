Large triangle ship with 3 white lights and flashing orange light, flew very low, with no sound.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jet a/c??  PD));2017-11-20 19:00:00;3-4 minutes;Large triangle ship with 3 white lights and flashing orange light, flew very low overhead with no sound. I was driving down Highway 6 from Santee towards Eutawville and saw 3 very bright lights side by side just over the tree line.   I pulled over once it got close to the road and a dark, very large triangle ship flew directly overhead.  From the bottom there were 3 white lights (one in each corner) and a flashing orange light by the front.   It moved extremely slow and made no noise.   I got some video from inside my car and jumped out when it was overhead and got a minute or so more solid video.;33.4882;-80.485
