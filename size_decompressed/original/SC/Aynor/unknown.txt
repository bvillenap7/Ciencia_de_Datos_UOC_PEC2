So I saw an orange/fiery glowing object in the sky as I was driving home from work and I like to look at Venus since I get a good vein of the planet from work on clear nights.  (Venus can be seen with the naked eye around the late evening time)  So anyway I’m driving and notice it’s cloudy so I can’t really see many stars but Venus gets pretty bright so I look anyway when I approach a big field.  Well as I’m driving I notice a bright object in the that resembles a plane that’s on fire so I kind of freak out, but then I notice the vehicle in front of me breaks hard as if they see what I see.  So I look up and this thing is definitely moving towards my job down 319 across the sky, and I have to focus on the road even though I slowed down from 55 to 35 to make sure I wasn’t crazy.  After that I slowly sped up and looked behind me only to see that I couldn’t even see this object in the sky no more and that’s when I had to really think about what I had just saw because! I didn’t even hear noice from when I rolled my window down.;33.9797;-79.1701
