Bright Orange Orbs seen in Little River, SC.;2014-10-22 20:45:00;3 minutes;Bright Orange Orbs seen in Little River, SC Oct. 22, 2014  Report sighting @ Coquina Marina - 4208 Coquina Harbour, Little River, SC 29566. Approx. time 20:45 EST. Description of sighting:  Looked up in the sky after dinner near the outside bar of Clark's resraurant and noticed one large bright orange orb hovering way over the horizon in the sky outside of marina possibly located near the channel or possibly further out above ocean. One orb became two orbs equidistant from the other, then three, then four.  Then four reverted to three then two then one and disappeared.  When asking my Fiance whether she saw the orbs she replied no like I was crazy they appeared again and she witnessed the orbs and how they multiplied to four and then disappeared. From more research this looks as if it was a common experience in this area.  Also when locals were questioned some were aware of these glowing orange orbs.  One of the inhabitants of an ocean front Condo in Cherry Grove called Springs Towers had witnessed this occurance on many occasions.  Also mentioned under further inquisition were talks of mysterious sonic booms which they called Seneca Booms.;33.8734000000003;-78.6493000000002
