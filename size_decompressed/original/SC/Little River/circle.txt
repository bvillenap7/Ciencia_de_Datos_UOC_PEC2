Three orange lights in the sky over Little River, SC in a triangle formation;2012-07-18 22:00:00;2 minutes;Three orange lights in the sky over Little River, SC in a triangle formation I saw 3 circular orange lights, in a triangle formation in Little River, SC, just a few miles outside North Myrtle Beach.  This was at 10:35pm 7/18/2012. It was a pretty clear night with only a few wispy clouds moving through the sky.  I was parking my car at my condo after work and happened to look up.  I heard nothing that would indicate it was an airplane, etc.  The lights went away all at once. I don't know how long it had been there before I had looked up.  I looked at it for about 2 minutes not believing what I was seeing.;33.8734000000003;-78.6493000000002
