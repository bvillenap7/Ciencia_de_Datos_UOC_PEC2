Suddenly awakened by a fast approaching, high accelerating, loud, roaring noise.  Vibration felt inside house. Like hovering over house. Lasted approx. 5 minutes. Intense and booming.  Ended abruptly after 5 min. Didn't fade out like vehicle or boat passing by.  My two dogs heard it also they ran into my room whimpering and hid. After 5 minutes, total and complete silence.  No fade out.  No other occurrences after. Outside - No traffic seen or heard. Waterway clear.  Sky clear of objects or lights.  Regular traffic/neighborhood sounds resumed within about 20 min.  NOT like military fly overs, which are common to Myrtle Beach area every week.;33.8734000000003;-78.6493000000002
