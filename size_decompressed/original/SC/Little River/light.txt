Red blue green and white light slowly floating randomly within same area, disappearing and reappearing brighter and dimmer at times.;2010-02-28 23:00:00;3 hours;Red blue green and white light slowly floating randomly within same area, disappearing and reappearing brighter and dimmer at times. Last night my girlfriend and I had my cousin and her boyfriend over as well as my girlfriends best friend and her boyfriend.  I had never met her friend before which made the night extremely weird. Hi nice to meet you, come check out this ufo in the sky!  My cousin, her boyfriend, and myself were standing out in the freezing cold last night smoking cigarettes and talking about life in general, when all three of us suddenly got silent and began questioning what was visually in front of us.  It was a bright white light high in the sky with six smaller lights blinking around it on both sides, six total.  There were only three other colors besides the white light in the middle.  RED BLUE GREEN, RED BLUE GREEN.  That was the pattern.  At times it would move farther away making it appear as one bright light.  Every few minutes it would begin to move around very slowly but then return to sitting still.  This took place for around two hours.  After I built up the ! self esteem to go inside and tell the others what I was witnessing thats exactly what happened.  They came outside and it only appeared to be a very bright star.  They began to laugh and give us funny looks when the light completely disappeared for three or four seconds only to reappear bright and flashing the pattern of multi-colored lights again.  We stayed outside observing for nearly three hours stunned in disbilief at what we were witnessing.  Im not saying it was a ufo I do not know what it was.  I am 22 years old and the five people with me were all between 22 and 26.  None of us have ever seen something like that before and when you witness something like that it is truly disturbing in a sense, it makes your spine tingle.  Shortly before the object went away two planes circled within the area of the object but would not get very close.  I just hate not knowing something and I really wish there was an explanation to what we witnessed.  I certainly never thought I wou! ld be sitting online typing this but i don't know what else to! do.  ho pefully others around the area saw the light also and they will hopefully talk about it as well.;33.8734000000003;-78.6493000000002
A pair of bright lights changed into bright organic lights like fire lights that went miles in seconds, no sound.;2012-10-24 22:00:00;120 seconds;A pair of bright lights changed into bright organic lights like fire lights that went miles in seconds, no sound. (Located in Little River, SC 4 miles from the ocean.)Suddenly there were a pair of bright lights in the north-eastern sky that looked like car headlights. They disappeared and reappeared seconds later, this time they looked organic like a fire light.  Again they disappeared and reappeared miles away in the south-eastern sky.  Again the fire looking light disappeared and reappeared in the north-eastern sky. Always they were a pair and moved in a pair.  I could hear a pin drop that clear night on October 24Th at apx 10PM.  I ran into the house and retrieved my camera only to miss a clear shot by seconds.  It could not have been a helicopter or airplane, I would have heard the engines.  It covered miles in seconds so not a balloon or glider.  Does anyone know what I saw?;33.8734000000003;-78.6493000000002
Approximately 8:00 pm on 12/10/12 three large glowing lights were seen over the direction of the ocean NEE of Little River SC.;2012-12-10 20:05:00;30 seconds each;Approximately 8:00 pm on 12/10/12 three large glowing lights were seen over the direction of the ocean NEE of Little River SC.  The orange like light appeared for about 3 seconds each in succession starting 1 then the 2nd, then the 3rd.  After third appeared all disappeared. Within 10 seconds multiple high maneuverable aircraft were circling the area.  The aircraft which appeared to be fighter aircraft due to their turn axis, remained in the area for 30 seconds and appeared to head south.  After they headed south, the lights appeared again in the southerner direction in which the aircraft were heading to.  After this they were lost from my view due to their elevation and tree's line or sight. No noise was heard, no engine sounds due to distance.  The lights and the aircraft appeared to be different in nature due to the light emitting aircraft having no faa lights, while the other aircraft had faa lights. Over the past three days there has been an increase in sonic booms.  I personally have heard three over the past week.;33.8734000000003;-78.6493000000002
Blinking/pulsing Lights.;2014-01-24 19:30:00;5 minutes;Blinking/pulsing Lights. Standing outside for a cigarette I look up at the sky.  This isn't the first time we have seen these lights.  They are blinking or flashing.  There are some times as many as 15 of them. Sometimes 5 lights in groups of two in different areas in the sky. Its too many of them too close together to be a commercial airplane.  Sometimes they may seem whitish in color and other times orange.  There are usually a group of them. Could they be military aircrafts or something of another nature. If anyone has seen any of these in this area please post. Thank you;33.8734000000003;-78.6493000000002

I was at a driving range with a friend of mine, I looked up and I noticed a orange light, not moving.  I showed my friend and we watched it for about 30-45 seconds and then it just disappeared.  After that, I kept looking in the sky around and didn't see any other lights.;33.8734000000003;-78.6493000000002
