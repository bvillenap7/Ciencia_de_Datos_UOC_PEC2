Someone else had to have seen this...;2012-01-18 19:45:00;30 Minutes;Someone else had to have seen this... My fiancé called me outside tonight to show me what he saw tonight.  He witnessed exactly what I saw around this time last year.  We previously lived on the Intracoastal water way and in February of 2011 I saw what looked light blinking white lights in a triangular formation.  He didn’t see it and thought I was a off my rocker.  They began in a triangle and then began to move closer together and then farther apart.  It lasted for about 2-3 minutes. Tonight (January 2012) what we saw was about 15-20 blinking lights moving randomly across the sky east to west and then north to south.  This lasted for about 30 minutes.  At one point I noticed other lights in the opposite part of the sky one of which was moving very slowly as a single, stable light and then took off and started to blink.   We also noticed another blinking light that turned orange and then blue in color then appeared to fall.  We heard police sirens about 2 minutes later. We noticed a really low flying plane about 10 minutes later. I am not sure if this is a coincidence or not but while we were looking at the sky we both noticed a shooting star at the same time. I have always been a skeptic but I’ve seen this twice now while living in Little River (North Myrtle Beach) in one year.  It was absolutely incredible to see.   I’m just curious to see if anyone else saw what I did.  It was mesmerizing, beautiful, and a little scary. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
