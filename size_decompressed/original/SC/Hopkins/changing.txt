I watched it for a second as it moved & I said look do you see that & we watched it for a few seconds and it appeared to be lighted.  He did not see it move as I did but all of a sudden it broke up into a lot of smaller pieces right as we watched it and it just vanished. The only way I can explain the way it looked was that it appeared to be a bunch of birds that were all together and then split apart and then just vanished.  I have not been able to stop thinking about it and I KNOW THAT THIS WASN'T OF THIS PLANET.  There is no way that it was military or man made.  Just thought you would like to know.
