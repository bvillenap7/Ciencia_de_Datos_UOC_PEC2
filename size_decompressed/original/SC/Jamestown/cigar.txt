I saw five stars at the bottom and one on the right upper top they were blinking, not at the same time.  It was moving from right upper to left lower.  It was north of me.  The lights were white.  It had no sound and it was really big, not like a plane.  I was wondering if you could tell me what is was.;33.2216;-79.6295
