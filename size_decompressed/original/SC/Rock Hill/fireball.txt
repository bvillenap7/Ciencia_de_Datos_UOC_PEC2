5 small balls of Orange light in a cluster.;2013-01-08 18:00:00;10 -15 minutes;5 small balls of Orange light in a cluster. A neighbor called me outside into the street to see the lights in the sky. He said driving home people had slowed down or stopped to watch them.  What we witnessed was 5 small pulsing orange to White balls of light.  They moved around apart then but then would come back close together. I ran inside for a scope to get a better view and my neighbor ran in to get a Telescope and as soon as we came out they moved away quickly.
