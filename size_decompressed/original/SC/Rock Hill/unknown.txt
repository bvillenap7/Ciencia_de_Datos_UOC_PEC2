After a few months, THEY are still here!;2007-07-26 21:00:00;Basically, all night;After a few months, THEY are still here! On or about May 29 2007, I reported seeing 5 objects at various positions in the night sky in my area [of northern Rock Hill SC.]  These stationary objects were bright white and flashing/strobing red and green in a counter-clockwise motion.  I'm reporting that those objects are still visible but in varying positions and at varying distances in the night sky.  This has been going on for over two months, and maybe even before my first notice of them, and I'm definitely concerned.  These 'indistinguishably shaped' bright white objects that are definitely strobing red and green are acting almost like sentries in some way.  They're just 'there' every night but in different positions and at different altitudes, BUT they are clearly discernible as being machines of some type.  These are NO planets/star bodies (unless we've never been told about planets flashing/strobing red and green in a counter-clockwise motion.)  Other heavenly bodies and aircraft are clearly discernable from these objects.  (As an aside:  Maybe this is going to sound even stranger but I recently realized that I haven't seen, felt or heard ANY mosquitos (and other types of local insects) in my neighborhood all summer.  There has been no spraying, tablet placement in standing water and no word of any kind from local government about either taking place.  I'm not saying that the appearance of the objects I've been seeing has anything to do with a surprising decrease in the 'bug' population in my area, but there may be.  I've never not been popped off and on all summer by mosquitos.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
((HOAX??))  Normal sightings at night are two or three. TONIGHT THERE ARE NINE!!;2007-08-18 22:00:00;Ongoing;Normal sightings at night are two or three. TONIGHT THERE ARE NINE!! I have been reporting over the past several months about my seeing bright white objects that are strobing green and red lights in a counter-clockwise pattern.  Mostly, the numbers of objects seen in a single evening are two or three.  I have seen tonight NINE, repeat NINE, of these objects in my immediate vicinity. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE WITNESSED THIS MANY OBJECTS [AS DESCRIBED ABOVE] IN ONE EVENING. These are NOT any known aircraft. These are totally stationary objects.  There is a nuclear power plant within 7 direct miles of my residence.  Other than that facility, there is nothing else of any interest in my area. We are a small bedroom community 22 miles south of Charlotte NC.  As I face due north in my backyard, FIVE objects are dispersed in the east and northeast quadrants.  A SIXTH is to my northwest (near the power plant), a SEVENTH AND EIGHTH are due west and the NINTH is to my southwest.  I live under the 'southern air traffic turn around' for Charlotte-Douglas Airport. To-date, not a single commercial aircraft has appeared to deviate away from the objects, even though most of the objects appear to be in or very near to the air traffic pattern. Also to-date, there has not been a single military aircraft come into this area to 'inspect or challenge' these objects.  My guess is that the presence of these objects is known to ATC and the government and these objects are being allowed to remain 'on station and unchallenged.'  What other rationale could there be? ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a hoax.  Nine sightings of GENUINE ufo's in one night is unlikely.  PD));34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501

Bright light moving side to side.;2017-07-15 22:00:00;30 minutes;Bright light moving side to side. A bright light at first believe to be a star or perhaps a satellite.  After viewing the object on our Skyview app, there was no satellite in the area at that time.   The object moved slightly left to right and from dim to very bright.  Object got brighter as it appeared to get closer.;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501

Appeared to be an off white or orange color.  Formation in a triangle.  One disappeared and then the other ones did within about a minute of each other.   Drove about 10 miles and saw the three formed again.  Driving on 77 north.  Not sure what we saw, but they disappeared very quickly both times.;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
