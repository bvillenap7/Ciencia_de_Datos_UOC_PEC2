Silent orange ball.;2015-05-30 22:00:00;30 seconds;Silent orange ball Sitting outside on Saturday night, May 30th, about 9:30-10PM we saw a bright orange ball pass over us.  It was larger than the light on an airplane with no blinking, no trails, no sound, moving very fast.  It went from south to north directly above us.   We watched it until it went behind the trees.  Took about 30 seconds to pass over.  Iâ€™ve seen a meteorite pass overhead and this was nothing like that.  It did not light up the area around us as it passed.  This experience almost exactly mirrors the descriptions from Ridgland, SC (5/24/15) and Charleston, SC (4/18/15.);34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
