I looked out the window near my bed.  Our curtains were not drawn, as we were on the eighth floor where no one could really see in.  I noticed a flashing yellow-orange light flashing slowly.  At first I thought nothing of it, thinking it was an airplane light or a radio tower light.  Soon white, or light yellow lights began to appear one-by-one in a ring around the original light.  I was frozen, trying to understand what I was seeing.  After the last light in the outer ring appeared. the entire set  of lights began to blink in unison, faster and faster. All of a sudden, the entire object zoomed out of sight, faster than anything I'd seen before.  I'll never forget it.;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501

Green and reddish/orange lights on the side, middle was a greenish color, moved right. I was on my back porch, facing south.  An orange/reddish  light caught my attention from behind a tree. I watched as it moved right.   When It was no longer behind the tree I saw that it was the shape of a circle it was just above the tree line. It had green and reddish/orange lights on the side, it's  center looked to be a green color.  From my point of view it seemed to  be a fourth of an inch wide.  It changed pace from kind of slow to slow.  As it went right it seemed to go back and forth slightly,  It eventually went south/southwest and I could no longer see it through the trees.  I heard no sounds coming from the object. Background wise.  The length from our porch to the tree I saw it  through is roughly 50-60ft.  Then there is a clearing behind that, that is about 30-35ft long.  Then it's a wooded area beyond that.;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
Unexplained light that accelerated towards the ground while changing colors.;2019-07-23 11:01:00;10 seconds;Unexplained light that accelerated towards the ground while changing colors. I was in the front of my home and a bright gold light appeared in the eastern sky traveling south slowly. It almost looked like a firework but I did not hear a concussion or sound.  By time my eyes got fixed on the light, it shot downward at a 45 degree angle and turned a bright green.  It accelerated until it went behind a tree line.  It was approximately 3 miles away.;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
