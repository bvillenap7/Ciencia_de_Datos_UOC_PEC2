Colorchangin Light over Rock Hill, SC 12/28/2009;2009-12-28 20:37:00;so far an hour;Colorchangin Light over Rock Hill, SC 12/28/2009 My Husband and I are watching a chevron shaped set of lights changing color.  When he was walking the dog, it seemed to move and be 3 colors serially, red, white and blue.  It also seemed to fly in little circles.  When he called me out, it was white then it turned green.  It flashes red every few seconds, but doesn't seem like equal intervals.  We have a small set of binoiculars, and through them there seems to be 3 separate lights.   We reside near Cherry Rd and Rte 77.  The lights were in the easterly direction.  We are in our late thirties. He is a truck driver, and I have 2 associates degrees, one in Math and the other in Music. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
