Bright silver object, seen on a clear day, moved right over my home from the south to the north heading towards Charlotte NC. Moved at about 20 mph at about 1,000 feet. Appeared to be about 100 feet in length. I went to get binoculars. Took about 15 seconds. Went back into the yard. Object had disappeared.  Then I saw it again through the binoculars moving west, still at a slow speed, but it was several miles away. Watched for several more seconds or so through the binoculars and it disappeared. No further contact. The object never made a sound.;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
