daylight ufo seen from my front window,amazing to see.;2005-10-04 13:30:00;seconds;daylight ufo seen from my front window, amazing to see. possibly cigar/disk shaped,off white with a door? or design of two brown vertical stripes a bit apart from each other,used about three quick zooming movements and was out of sight. seemed very low,and almost decending,but also appeared to be quite large so i believe it was the angle/distance that i saw it from that made it seem that way. i did call the police to report it but was told they hadnt heard of anything being launched/in the area and i was not told of anyone else making any reports and was told to call back if i saw it again,which sadly i did not.

Total of 5 red/green/white flashing objects seen over a 3+ hour period.  All were stationary!;2007-05-09 22:00:00;3+ hours;Total of 5 red/green/white flashing objects seen over a 3+ hour period.  All were stationary! On May 9, 2007, I witnessed 5 objects flashing/strobing/oscillating a red light, with steady green and white lights while the object was being quite stationary.  I could not make out the shapes of the objects due to distance (or maybe because they may not have been very large), but through binoculars I could defintely see the activity of the described lights.  At first, there was only one object (as described above.) That was at 21:45.  By 0100 a.m. on May 10, there had appeared four more objects, each quite stationary and flashing/strobing red, with steady green and white lights while the objects were collectively quite stationary.  All five objects were in a triangulated pattern covering about a 5-mile area in the sky.  These objects were defintely NOT aircraft of any known type.  Even though there was air traffic coming and going from Charoltte-Douglas Airport (some 30 miles away I live under an existing flight pattern), it was impossible to mistake these five objects as being normal aircraft.  The main aspect of these objects was that they did not move!  At whatever altitude they were at, they did not move!!  But, again, there was no mistaking these objects for normal aircraft.  The sky was clear, with minimal interference from earlier rain clouds that had passed through.  Normal air traffic was discernable from these objects.  Stars were clearly visible.  Temperature was about 60 degrees.  (As an aside - while I was looking at the first red/green/white object, at around 22:15 through binoculars, I distinctly saw and visually tracked [for about 5 seconds] a greyish rectangular object passing through the heavens. I say the heavens because that object was definitely outside our atmosphere and passing at maybe 200 miles up. I have seen the space shuttle three times [and even once when it was connected to the space station] as it passed over my area and I knew that the altitude of the shuttle was 200+ miles above me.  When watching this sixth object [just by chance] I had the disctinct feeling that it was at least as high as the shuttle would have been. And that means that this sixth object, to have been visible to me even through binoculars, had to have been a VERY large object.  Rate of speed of this sixth object was half again faster than that of what the shuttle's speed normally is when in orbit (meaning, this sixth object was moving at 17,500++ mph.) There was NO mistaking this sixth object for space junk, a satellite, the space station or anything other than a VERY large rectangular machine moving from West-to-East at a high speed.  All in all, it was quite a night.  Thanks!;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
1-4 Lights Flickering On and Off and Then Disappeared in Upstate South Carolina near Rock Hill.;2009-09-02 18:00:00;25-40 minutes;1-4 Lights Flickering On and Off and Then Disappeared in Upstate South Carolina near Rock Hill. Around 1800 I was driving Northbound on I-77 in Chester and York Counties, South Carolina.  When I proceeded to see 4 lights close to each other.  After further observation it would drop to 1 light or 2 lights then back to 4.  They were in a parallel up and down shape which is very hard to explain and they were very very close together.  They were at a stand still for about 30 minutes and i looked away for a split second and they had disappeared.  After they disappeared they were not spotted again.;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
Space Debris falls out of orbit and burns up.  ((NUFORC Note:  Confirmed satellite re-entry.  PD));2015-06-29 01:51:00;30 seconds;Space Debris falls out of orbit and burns up. I first saw this object out the corner of my eye.  It was falling from space and burning up.  As it fell it kept breaking apart. I knew it wasn't a meteor. The tail was short, orange, red and yellow in color.  The main objects were white hot. It disappeared or burned up after about 30 seconds. I called NBC Charlotte that morning around 0900.  They said I was the only person to report it.  Someone mentioned a SpaceX launch in Florida that blew up the day before.  I thought it was space debris, but now I'm thinking it was a booster falling out of orbit. ((NUFORC Note:  Confirmed satellite re-entry.  PD));34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
