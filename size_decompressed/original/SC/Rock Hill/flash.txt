white flashing light over Rock Hill, SC.;2006-03-10 20:30:00;10 seconds;white flashing light over Rock Hill, SC. My husband & I saw a series of 3 flashes high in the sky looking towards the North while sitting on our back deck. I am not sure of the time but it was approx. 8:30 pm. The sky was very clear & the moon had not risen high enough to wash out the stars. There were also several commercial aircraft flying at different altitudes. Some were on approach to Charlotte Douglas & some were much higher. We did not see a craft. We saw the first 2 bright white flashes about 1 second apart. Then after approx. 7-8 seconds, we saw 1 more flash in the same spot. We didn't see anything else. Since we couldn't see any shape of a craft & didn't hear any sound, we are assuming that it was from something high in the sky. It very well may be something quite earthly & not a ufo. Approximately 5 minutes later we observed a moving craft that had a bright white light on the front and a blinking white light behind that light. It was traveling very fast compared to the commercial aircraft in the sky & was low in the sky, also traveling towards the North. I watched it through the binoculars until it disappeared behind the treeline & could not see an outline of the craft. We had a similar sighting of the flashing lights last year that was also reported to this site. We live a mile outside of the city of Rock Hill, away from city lights. My husband is a computer executive & I am a scuba instructor & travel agent.  We both have traveled in planes extensively & I was formerly in Civil Air Patrol & earned my observor wings as a teenager to look for crashed airplanes. I would appreciate hearing whether anyone else saw the flashes of light.;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
flashy lights that stops in the sky and changes directions very distinctly.;2010-10-14 18:00:00;flashing lights;flashy lights that stops in the sky and changes directions very distinctly. I go jogging basically everynight for two hours, around 7 o'clock always. Right when it start getting dark i see flashing lights.  The lights flash on and off repeatedly. Its been following me for the past 5 nights. I called my friend to see if she saw what i saw, she stepped outside and she describe everything that i was seeing.  The weird thing is, is that when i called her the flashing light was moving to the right and when i told her to step outside it stopped and moved to the left.  I see these lights all the time now, i know for a fact when i go jogging tonight that i will see them again. This is serious and is no joke i don't know what's going on.   The lights are mostly white and flashy, sometimes they are a mix of white and red.  They move slowly and sometimes stops.  I've seen a multiple of 3 in one night.
