Balls of lght in a snowstorm.;2000-02-02 20:00:00;All night;Balls of lght in a snowstorm. There was the beginning of a huge snowstorm outside and I was inside by the fire.  My mom and I were listening to the radio when suddenly the DJ made that annonuncement that people in and around Charlotte, NC (30 miles away) were seeing balls of light flying through the air.  I immediately drove over to my best friend's house and we watched the sky light up with brilliant flashes of light.  I don't know how to describe them except to say they definitely weren't lightning.  Later that night the government let out a release saying that it was transistors blowing up (all at the same time, during a 50 mile radius mind you I could drive in this weather).  The next day they said that it was heat lightning (in the snow) caused by the strange change in weather (it was hot the week before). So many people saw it, I figured somebody should report it.

We watched a faint light, high in the sky, blink every ten seconds and made several changes in direction before gmoving out of sight.;2004-10-15 22:30:00;10-15 minutes;We watched a faint light, high in the sky, blink every ten seconds and made several changes in direction before gmoving out of sight. On October 15th, around 10:30 pm, my husband & I were sitting on the back deck of our home in the country, looking at the night sky. WE are a mile outside the Rock Hill, SC city limits.It was clear and there were many stars visible.  Toward the S-SE, I saw a faint blink of a light high in the sky. I watched & 10 seconds later, saw it again.  There was no sound.   I looked through my binoculars & told my husband to look in that direction & saw the blink again. Through the binoculars I could only see the light blink.  I could not see any outline of an object. Several commercial airplanes flying at high altitude flew over as we watched.  The flash seemed to be much higher than these.  I switched to my monocular nightscope & continued watching the flash, which came every 10 seconds.  Through the nightscope, I was able to see many more stars & got a fix on the flash's position based on 2 stars close by.  The light moved slightly to the East, stopped, moved to the west, then north. It made several more moves, then moved due east & out of the area with the 2 stars.  It was soon out of view because of trees & my roofline.   A minute later we saw with the naked eye, a dim object moving south to north along the same area of sky.  It moved out of sight.  Another couple of minutes later we saw a similar object moving north to south on the opposite path.  I watched it with the nightscope & it suddenly flared up very brightly & then dimmed until I could hardly see it.  It moved out of sight.  These 2 objects appeared to be satelites, except for the flare-up.  After that, we observed 3 meteors in that same area. (The Orionids are visible now) I have watched every night since & have not see it again.  The next day a high altitude plane made many Y-shaped contrails across the sky. I actually watched as it cut off the contrail to connect the Y.  This happened for 2 days in a row.  I don't know if there is a conection or not. Our Bio info is as follows: I am a 47 yr old SCUBA Instructor.  I also was in Civil Air Patrol while in high school & earned my observer wings.  I have flown in many types of aircraft & spent a lot of time on Air Force bases.  I have lived under the flight path of Charlotte Douglas International airport for 14 yrs.  I saw my first UFO with my family when I was around 10 yrs old.   My husband is a corporate exec in the IT field.  He is very analytical & tries to reason through sightings like this, but was truly stumped & a little un-nerved by this. ((AMENDMENT TO ORIGINAL REPORT)) Amendment to previous report on 10/22/04 This is an ammendment to my previous report dated 10/22/04. I got the times mixed up on the 2 objects that were a few minutes apart going in opposite directions. They were right after dark on Oct 15th. The object that blinked every 10 seconds was between 10 & 10:30 PM & there were commercial aircraft flying in the same area of sky during the sighting but the object appeared to be much higher in the sky. After reading up on satelites, I believe the 2 objects were satelites, with the one that flared being an irridium flare. The 3rd object, however, has me stumped.

At 9:40 p.m. on August 20 2007 I witnessed two bright spherical lights for about two minutes.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and STS??  PD));2007-08-20 19:40:00;2 mins;At 9:40 p.m. on August 20 2007 I witnessed two bright spherical lights/objects for about two minutes.  At first, there was only one. I couldn't make out the shape. It wasn't traveling very fast. Then, a second one literally appeared behind the first and at a distance of about one mile.  I tracked both visually and with binoculars.  As I watched the first one, and at the end of about two miniutes, it turned a dirty burnt orange hue, accelerated and then disappeared.  A few seconds later, the second object did the same thing.  Both objects left at the same point in the night sky.  There was absolutely no mistaking these objects for any known aircraft.  There was no sound of any kind.  The objects were traveling from west to east at an unknown altitude.  I have seen such objects in my area twice before over the past few months - slowing moving bright spheres that turn a different hue and then just disappear.  There is a nuclear power plant in my area.  These two lights/objects originally came from that direction (to the northwest of my home.) ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and STS??

Arcing Light Ball.;2014-03-01 23:15:00;20 seconds;Arcing Light Ball While my neighbor and I were standing in the back yard tonight he motioned for me to walk over so I could see something in the sky.   I initially did not see anything, but a white ball of light with a blue haze went above the tree line.  It traveled up about 10 degrees above the tree line, arced down 3-5 degrees, arced back up above the previous height and then went down below the tree line.  It was a very fluid like motion.  The size was around 4-5 times the size of Venus to the naked eye.  We were looking towards the southwest and located at 34.9732, -81.080.

A bright light that looked like a star, changing speed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sightings of satellites??  PD));2014-09-01 05:45:00;1 minute;A bright light that looked like a star, changing speed A bright light that looked like a star changing speed.   I was looking at stars and saw one that was moving ever so slightly, then it started picking up speed and moved at a moderate speed out of sight behind the treeline.   About 10 seconds later either the same one or another one came out of the treeline into sight, and was moving much faster than before until it disappeared into the atmosphere.  There were 3 of us there and we all saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501

Orange-reddish light traveling slowly from South to North near Hwy 901/ I-77 area.;2015-05-30 22:31:00;1 minutes;Orange-reddish light traveling slowly from South to North near Hwy 901/ I-77 area. Object appeared in southern Sky near Hwy 901 and I-77 area.  Observed a orange-reddish light traveling from the South headed due North.   First observed Orange-reddish coming from the south over the tree line, and thought it was a firework, but then realized it was not traveling up but horizontal from South to North.   Followed Orange-reddish light over trees and house.  It was traveling too slow to be a small airplane.  There was no noise coming from the object.    It remained on a steady South to North course and a constant slow speed.;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
