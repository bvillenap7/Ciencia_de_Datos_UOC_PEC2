I stopped in the middle of the road, and looked closer at the object.   In the car was my son closer we  and daugheter.  We all looked for a flashing light thinking it was a helicopter or airplane.  We didn't see one, as we looked closer at it we noticed it was an ornage cone shaped oblect that was pulsating.   We turned on a street to try and keep up with it.   We turned the car off to hear any noise and there wasnt any coming from it.  The oblect finally after about 7 minutes disappeared into the distance.;34.9353421875001;-81.0274085937501
