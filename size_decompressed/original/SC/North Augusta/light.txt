She has had no interest in the extraterrestrial, and she claimed that in her 81 years alive, she had never seen something like it. It was just one light at first, like a really bright star, appearing white in color. It would move back and forth in a general area, moving up very quickly, then left, so forth and so on, but never moving that far in the sky. At one point it multiplied into three dots of light, which we both witnessed, that were in a perfect line and moved with each other. It blinked into six lights at one point, still in a perfect line (but with a gap in between the two sets of three), though she didn't see it, as where she was on the porch she couldn't see the craft as well as I could see it. That was quick, and didn't happen again. It went back down to one dot again. I watched it move around a bit more before it eventually moved around enough to be out of my line of sight behind the trees. For a bit of debunking, it couldn't have been a plane, as the light moved rapidly back and forth, seemingly at random, and would move up and down. It couldn't have been a firefly, either, as it was behind trees, and would make that firefly at LEAST the size of an elephant, which I frankly don't believe is possible. I highly doubt it was a drone, as it was taller than the trees around my house (at least 100 feet) in a low visibility area in near-pitch black, not to mention that the lights that appeared would make the drone huge. I have had casual interest in UFOs before, but I never saw what could be one until now.;33.5432844827586;-81.9466086206897
Long  string of lights traveling for south west to the north east.  Evenly spaced apart.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-28 21:15:00;10 minutes;Long  string of lights traveling for south west to the north east.  Evenly spaced apart and traveling at the same speed. I saw about  40 or 50 but they were already  above and passing by when I noticed it.;33.5432844827586;-81.9466086206897
