A church sits right off the 4 lane road on the left at the top of the hill.  I was in the passenger seat & looked up.  What I saw was just pure confusion.  My first logical thought was IS THAT A PLANE GOING DOWN?  The object was completely & steadily vertical.  Simple, very uncomplicated plane type shape.  Vertical, cylindrical, 3 lights.  Shadowy aura, blurry background almost computer pixel-y looking.  More 2-d than 3-d, if that makes any sense. It was right above the church's roof.  The driver did not want to stop so I kept looking in the rear view window, I could still the 3 lights behind the trees as we headed down the hill.  I convinced the driver to turn around,.. we returned & there was nothing out of the ordinary.  It was gone. It was almost like an apparition.  Because we were SO close to this thing it was extremely confusing as to why neither me nor the driver could focus our eyes on it.  Everything around it was clearly there, but looking at this thing was just too much to process.  It was very jerky, fast moving - but at the same time not moving at all.  Seemed very busy, the energy was busy.  But it did nothing at the same time. I was too stunned & confused during & afterward to even THINK of grabbing my camera out of my purse.  But after doing some research online I found one picture that resembled what I saw.  I will e-mail it.  Note again though: that I did NOT take the picture it just RESEMBLES what I saw last night.;33.5432844827586;-81.9466086206897
