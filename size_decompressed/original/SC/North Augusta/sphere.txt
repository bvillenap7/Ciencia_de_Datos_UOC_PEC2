Three large round orange lights slowly drifting across the sky.;2014-02-02 22:00:00;4 minutes;Three large round orange lights slowly drifting across the sky. Something is lighting up my deck so naturally I look up.  I see three large orange round lights floating past my house.  They weren't going very fast.  For the most part they were in a triangle formation then two became fairly close together, then back into the same formation.  They drifted past my house, I called a friend to look out her door about a mile from me and she describes the same thing to me.  While on the phone with her, our call was dropped twice but, she was still seeing them last I spoke with her.;33.5432844827586;-81.9466086206897
