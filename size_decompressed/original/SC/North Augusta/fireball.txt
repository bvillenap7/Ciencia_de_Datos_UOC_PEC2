We were observing fireworks in Merriweather School District Area off Martintown Road and thought at first it was a spark from there but then it kept moving east and seemed to continue with the same intensity of glow.   It did not go out but went so far away it finally disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume and evening sighting, and have amended the time above, to reflect that fact.
