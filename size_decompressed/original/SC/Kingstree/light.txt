Each time they reappeared they were in a different spot, almost as if they were warping to get to the next spot rather than flying.;2007-02-27 20:00:00;2min;I'm 24 years old, and in the military.  I was nowhere near any military installation during the sighting I will explain in this paragraph. I was riding with my wife to my mother in law's house, I suddenly looked towards the. sky when I saw a very bright light similar to a star, in the sky.  Then it went out for about 2-3 seconds, and when it reapeared, there was a second one with it.  Then they both went outfor 2-3 seconds and when they reapeared there were three.  Each time they reappeared they were in a different spot, almost as if they were warping to get to the next spot rather than flying.  I asked my wife was she seeing this and she said yes. I asked her what could it be, neither of us had an answer.   This went on for about two miniutes, then they just vanished.  I've never seen anything like it. I did not get any pictures, I'm not saying this was an alien space craft.  This is just simply what I saw.  Thank you for listening.
