Aircraft flying over home in Kingstree, SC.;2014-04-10 21:00:00;10 minutes;Air Craft fling over home in Kingstree, SC. On April 10 2014 around 9:00 pm, my wife and I returned home after a talent show in Kingstree SC.   The driveway to our home is pretty long, but before pulling up to the house, we notice some type of aircraft hovering over the trees in our back yard.  I asked my wife to pull up a little closer so we could get a better look, and she did very frightenly.   We sat there and watched this flying object over five minutes as it just stayed in one spot.  It seemed like whatever it was noticed us watching and started moving slowly away.  The craft seemed to be moving at a slow rate of speed but but was covering a lot of ground.   The craft was very large, triangular shaped in the front with  big blue and white lights on the front, and red lights on the rear.   I watched the craft until it got out of site going toward Columbia SC.   I called the Authorities and told them what we had seen.  Their reply was, the Air Force was doing a test flight and would not give any details at all.;33.6897;-79.7829
