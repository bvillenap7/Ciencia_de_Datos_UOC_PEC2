bright light in the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of International Space Station.  PD));2011-06-15 05:16:00;3 minutes;bright light in the night sky At exactly 5:16 am I observed a bright round light moving across the sky.  The object moved at a consistent slow speed.  The object was low enough that if it had been a helicopter or small aircraft I would have heard noise.  I detected no sound other than a burger alarm and dog barking in the distance.   The object moved slowly across the sky for around 3 minutes before it passed behind a tree line, beyond my view. I attempted to film the object with my Android mobile phone.  Unfortunately, the overall darkness of the night sky and my shaky hand did not amount to any worthwhile capture. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of International Space Station.
