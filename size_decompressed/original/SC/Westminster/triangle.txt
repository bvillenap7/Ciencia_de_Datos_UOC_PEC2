My best friend and her husband and kids stay on my property right now and they were waiting on dominos to deliver.  They were hanging out outside next to my mommas car.  I went out to speak with my niece and I looked up in the sky and coming over my across the street neighbors' home were these 3 lights.  they were huge, triangle shaped and yellowish in color, than 3 more come over the home and again 3 more.  We just stood there looking up at them as they passed by, I could see the clouds in between the 3 triangular ships but could not see the clouds through the ships.  It took a total of 2 to 3 minutes for them to pass. Than they just disappeared. My husband was in the 82nd airborne so I know what planes etc. look like from beneath at night, I have watched the night sky my entire life because I love stars, and have seen flares and fireworks in the sky many times, but never have I seen anything like this! .  They were going north east (I think can show which way if followed up on).  All of us saw it and still cant figure out what it was. We are willing to speak to any professional who would like to follow up.;34.6962;-83.1558000000001
