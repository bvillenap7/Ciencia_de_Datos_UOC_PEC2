The low-hanging cloud looked too dense;1995-10-15 17:30:00;3 minutes;The low-hanging cloud looked too dense In about 1995 I was living in Oconee County, South Carolina. I was driving south on Highway 11 towards Highway 24 where there's an overpass. It was pre-dusk. I was about a mile away from the intersection when I noticed a strange looking cloud hanging low over the overpass. It was a grey, cloudy day but the cloud that caught my attention stood out from the background. It didnâ€™t look right, it looked too dense. Suddenly five strobe-like lights flashed from the cloud in a 1-2-3-4-5-5-4-3-2-1 horizontal pattern. It was over in a second. I immediately flashed my headlights five times and kept driving. I exited at the overpass and drove under the cloud and stopped. I looked up but couldn't see anything. Weeks later my husband said he was on his way home less than a mile from the overpass. It was just past sunset, a clear night. He said he saw what at first looked like a brightly lit semi trailer-truck cross Highway 24 in front of him. Except, it was about 30 feet up in the air. Seconds later, by the time he got to where it had crossed the road it had disappeared behind a fire tower and some trees. There's no cross street there, only pasture and a dirt driveway to the tower. He said he wasn't sure of the shape of the object, only that it seemed about the size of a semi, 40-50 feet long or so.
