repeating observation of object in westerly sky after sundown and before object sets, rapid flashing red, green white and blue;2020-10-07 19:45:00;30 minutes +;repeating observation of object in westerly sky after sundown and before object sets, rapid flashing red, green white and blue my third entry, first was on 09/30/2020. object can be seen every evening that skies are clear, about 1/2 hour after sunset until the object sets in the west, about 21:30. I have observed his object on several occasions prior to the first report over the past year. my first sighting was in Sept 2019. the object appears to the naked eye as a rotating sphere with rapidly flashing lights, red white green and blue. with binoculars, the object appears triangular possibly pyramidal or octahedron, rapid flashing lights make it hard to decide on shape. I believe it is a Human made object, but nit is unidentified to me, I would like to know what it is. I will continue to report it until I am contacted with reasonable explanation or in person.;33.8358;-81.1215
