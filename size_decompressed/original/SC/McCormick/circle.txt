My spouse and I were standing on our front porch of our home smoking a cigarette when we saw what we thought to begin with was an extremely bright star (almost looked like someone holding a flashlight from the sky pointed back down towards earth).   Then we both noticed it was moving.  It was solid white light with no other color.  Nothing was blinking.   It seemed as though it changed its course very suddenly and then faded out of sight quickly.   Time from first sighting to disappearance approximately 30–45 seconds.;33.9169;-82.2733
