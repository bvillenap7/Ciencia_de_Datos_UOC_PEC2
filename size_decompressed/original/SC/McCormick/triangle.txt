Silent, black triangular shaped craft ascending from water and slowly passing over treeline.;2015-06-29 20:30:00;30 seconds;Silent, black triangular shaped craft ascending from water and slowly passing over treeline. We were at Strom Thurmond Dam near Clarks Hill, when a black triangular object appeared in the sky.  When it was first spotted, it looked as though it was ascending from the ground.   It leveled out just above the tree line,  approximately 100 ft in the air.  It was completely silent and moved too slow to be an aircraft.  After about 15 seconds it was out of view.   I think this craft came out of the water near the dam.  Not sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.9169;-82.2733
