radial light seen as two object separate in night sky;2006-07-01 20:00:00;20 seconds;Radial light seen as two object separate in night sky About a year ago I was visiting with my neighbor at the time standing in the yard talking when we noticed what I thought up until today really was two airplanes converging.  They came together for a while and then we saw a burst of light going our into a radial pattern that almost resembled a large flash and the expected burst of a firework shot.  This had to be several miles away and up and the burst would have to be fairly large.  After the burst of light went out in the almost perfect symmetrical pattern, the two lights separated and moved away from each other until they were out of site. We both wondered what in the world it could be and I surmised that it must have been a jet doing a mid-air refuel and maybe the fuel upon separation caused the light.  I had not really thought about it in a while until watching a show this evening reminded me of the event.  The radial burst was so vivid that it makes me wonder what it was.
