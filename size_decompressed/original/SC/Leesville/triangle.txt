Triangular object with 3 red lights over Lake Murray SC.;2015-12-01 21:30:00;30 minutes;Triangular object with 3 red lights over Lake Murray SC. In December 2015, I was sitting on my back porch and noticed a big triangular shaped object in the sky.  It had 3 red lights.  I tought it was some type of plane at first but the object stayed in one place for approximately 20-30 minutes.  I also then thought it was some type of radio tower although I had never saw a tower there before.  I decided to try at take pictures of this with my phone.  I could not see the objects lights in my phone, but I snapped several pictures anyway.  All I could see on the picture was black.  After twenty or thirty minutes the object began to move.  It lowered slowly behind a line of trees and then it was gone.  Ive never saw it there again.  I really had not gave it much thought until today when I was scrolling through my pictures on my phone.  The pictures I had took that only showed a black screen before now have an object in them.  It's hard to explain the pictures but I will try and upload them for you to see.;33.9132;-81.4598
