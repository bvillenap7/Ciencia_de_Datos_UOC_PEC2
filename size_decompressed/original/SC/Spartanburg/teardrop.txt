Upside down teardrop hovering over hwy witnessed by others.;2008-11-15 18:00:00;5 mins.;Upside down teardrop hovering over hwy witnessed by others. Heading south on I-85 between Spartanburg and Greenville, SC just past the intersection of I-26 E (also locally known as the crossroads of the south) about 1 mile. As the wolfpack of vehicles I was in ( about 15 vehicles) turned onto a straightaway there was an object in the sky that resembled a lightbulb with the threaded part taken off the lightbulb. It had a texture like the moon but was orange and seemed to have a arua about it like heat rising in the desert, from the bottom to the top.. All the vehicles hit there brakes at the same time. Myself and another guy in a truck realizing this may be a one in a million event raced to where the object was over the road. The only time I took my eyes off the object was when I bolted into the emergency lane. As we both approached the object it turned toward the south and flew away with the same heat signature that appeared to surroound the object. It was almost like the orange part that I could see had disappeared when it turned, and the back part of it was the same color as the sky, almost morphing invisible, except for the heat trail. Even though it moved quickly it moved with such fluidity. By the time me and the other guy got to where it was it looked as if it was 20 miles away over Greenville, SC in maybe 30secs to a minute. I pulled over next to the guy and he said what the hell was that? I shrugged my shoulders and he drove away. About 5 minutes later I was home telling my wife what happened. I watched the local news that night and for days and no reports. I just wondered if anyone else may have seen the same as me and the other guy. I have never seen anything like this in any report or pictures anywhere. It appeared to be more biological looking then mechanical.;34.9073211916465;-81.9126249692898
