We were driving down the road and we saw something with lights.  We thought that it was a light tower, however when we approached it more it had the brightest light I have ever seen shining on the cloud.  As we passed it we show lights around the object.  As soon as we passed it, it flew across the road in somewhat of an arch and then came up behind us and followed us at about tree-level.  It seemed to fly curved to its side instead of a straight path.  It followed us for about 2 or 3 miles getting closer than slowing down.  We were the only ones on the road and then another car started to come down the road and it flew behind the trees and stopped.  We didn't see it after that. ((NUFORC Note:  No date is indicated for the event.  We have arbitrarily assigned a date for the night before the report was written.  We will attempt to obtain the date.;34.9073211916465;-81.9126249692898
