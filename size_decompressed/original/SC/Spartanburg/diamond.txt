Fairly large, diamond/kite shaped, white object spotted in mid-day sitting still in the sky for almost a minute or more.;2008-09-25 14:00:00;1 minute;Fairly large, diamond/kite shaped, white object spotted in mid-day sitting still in the sky for almost a minute or more. I was young, probably around 8, which is why I put 2008 in the date box.  I was driving in the car with my grandma, and I was in the backseat looking outside of the window.  As we drove and I watched the almost completely clear, blue sky except a few clouds, I noticed a white, diamond shaped object in the sky.  It was actually kite shaped, with two short sides attached to two longer sides, but it wasn't a kite. It was fairly large, much larger than an aircraft would be at the height it looked to be at.  It was completely still in the sky, staying at that one place until my grandma drove past it to the point I could no longer see it.  I was too shocked to say anything to her, and I was certain she would laugh at me or call me crazy.   I do not believe this was a dream because I remember it very clearly to this day.
