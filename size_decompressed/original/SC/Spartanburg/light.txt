white light slowly meandering directly above in upstate South  Carolina;2012-01-14 19:00:00;45 minutes;white light slowly meandering directly above in upstate South  Carolina In the highest point of the sky (the zenith I think it's called) we saw a bright white light about the size of a bright star or planet.  The light drifted in slow sweeping circles then would remain stationary for a minute then would drift off again.   Sometimes it would follow a straight line then pause to circle or curve again.  If I raised up both arms with hands two feet apart that would indicate how wide the path of this object meandered.  It seemed as high as small aircraft that would be passing overhead at the same time.  It also seemed to flash or pulsate about every three seconds.  This flashing wasn't always noticed, but more so when the object seemed to accelerate in a straight line.  I mentioned above that the time we obsereved this was  about 30 to 40 minutes but we actually went indoors after that long as it is a chilly nights a here in upstate South Carolina.;34.9073211916465;-81.9126249692898
