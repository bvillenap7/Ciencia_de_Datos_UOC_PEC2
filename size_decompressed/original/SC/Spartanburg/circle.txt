MY GIRL FRIEND AND I WERE PARKING. I NOTICED THAT HER SKIN STATED FLASHING WITH A GLOWING RED COLOR. WHEN I SAW IT I THOUGHT THERE WAS A FIRETRUCK PARKED BEHIND US. WE NOTICED MY SKIN WAS GLOWING TOO. MY CAR WAS BLACK INSIDE. NOTHING HAD THIS GLOW BUT OUR SKIN. WE NOTICE WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PLANE. IT HAD MULTICOLORED LIGHTS BLINKING ON IT. THE PLANE LOOKED NORMAL AND VERY FAR AWAY. THEN OUR SKIN STATED FLASHING BLUE. THIS TIME I JUST KNEW I POLICE. STILL THERE WAS NOTHING JUST THIS FAR AWAY PLANE. I TOLD HER I THOUGHT IT WAS A UFO. SHE SAID LET'S GO. I REALY JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE AT THAT TIME. MY CAR WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING. THEN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A PLANE WAS ABOUT 10 FEET ABOVE MY CAR. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE US AND THE CAR. IT JUST SIT THERE. LIGHTS WERE FLASHING BRIGHT FROM ALL AROUND IT. IT COULD HAVE BEEN DISK SHAPED. IF YOU SAW THIS THING IN THE NIGHT SKY. IT WOULD LOOK JUST LIKE A PLANE. BEFORE THAT DAY. I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A UFO. I HAVE NEVER  BEEN THAT AFRAID IN MY LIFE. THEY COULD DO ANYTHING TO YOU.  WHEN IT LEFT. I WAS ABOUT AN HOUR LATE GETTING HER HOME. WHERE DID THE TIME GO? IT WAS NEWYEARS. WE DIDN'T DRINK OR DO DRUGS.;34.9073211916465;-81.9126249692898
Bright circular object flashing red, green, and blue lights...had bobbing and subtle side to side movement.;2013-04-05 22:00:00;15 minutes;Bright circular object flashing red, green, and blue lights...had bobbing and subtle side to side movement. My cousin and I were leaving my house to go to the store when something bright caught my attention right before I got in the car.  It was circular and was flashing red, green, and blue lights and looked like it was about 10 miles away.   We both watched it for about 10 min and noticed it was bobbing up and down and occasionally made subtle side to side movements.  It was brighter than a star which is what made me initially notice the object.  From where we were it was located just above the tree line and when we returned from the store it was gone.  We realized it wasn't an aircraft becuase it kept the same intensity for a long period of time.;34.9073211916465;-81.9126249692898
