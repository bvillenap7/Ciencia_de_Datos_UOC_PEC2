I own a commercial cleaning business this is my usual routine route every night. I saw an object which at first glance I thought this was a low flying plane but the object was moving at a very low rate of speed. With my head hanging out of my window now I gazed at the object for over a couple of minutes as I proceeded slowly down the road. The object was triangular and resembled a Stealth Fighter. My employee riding in the front seat saw the same thing I did. The employee in the back seat had limited view of the object. The object was traveling adjacent to my truck at a crawl speed and then to a hover. It appeared dark-toned and had lights at each tip of its triangular shape. I was near 1604 East Main when I turned in the parking lot of the bank to further look at the object. When I entered the parking area the object ascended slowly to a higher altitude and slowly gained speed moving in the opposite direction I saw it first traveling in. The object was silent no engine noise or jet sounds. The flight pattern made me conclude this is not an airplane, jet, helicopter or anything of that nature. The object left my sight as it moved across the sky opposite from the parking lot.;34.9073211916465;-81.9126249692898
