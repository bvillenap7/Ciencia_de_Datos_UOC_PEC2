Stationary light with increasing brightness - then dimming and moving away to the west.;2005-01-26 15:10:00;20 seconds;Stationary light with increasing brightness - then dimming and moving away to the west. This object was stationary in the northern sky.  Initially, it could be described as a bright star but almost immediately, the intensity increased exponentially.  Then it faded to a point no brighter than the background stars and traveled west until it completely disappeared.  It moved at the same velocity of a commercial jet but there were no beacons, strobes, or navigational lights of any kind.  My first thought was that I had witnessed a meteor straight-on... it became extremely bright and then burned out.  But that would not explain the turn to the west and then the disappearance. The second object was exactly like the first but was never bright.  It followed a similar path again with no lighting that would identify it as a commercial aircraft.  There were aircraft in the sky and it was easy to differentiate.;34.7234;-82.4651000000001
