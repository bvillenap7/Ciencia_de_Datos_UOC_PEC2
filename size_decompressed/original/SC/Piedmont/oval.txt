While driving down I85 south, I saw a bright light with no clouds in the sky.  I assumed the object was a man made aircraft with sun reflecting off the metal surface.  The object then began to pulse bright light and made a jerky movement before glowing extremely bright and vanishing.  As said before, there were no clouds in the sky for the object to be hidden behind.;34.7234;-82.4651000000001
