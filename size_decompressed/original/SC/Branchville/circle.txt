((Advertising lights?));2005-02-07 01:30:00;30 minutes;It was a circular shaped object with about 10 to 12 bright white lights coming from it and it kept rotating back and forth. There was a circular shaped object that had about 10 to 12 bright white lights that were similar to search lights coming off it.  It kept rotating back and forth and would travel a distance of about four to five miles in about five seconds.  When I pulled out my flashlight the object started moving closer down towards us until I turned it off.  There was no sound coming from it.  It kept doing this for about 30 minutes and then disapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the possibility of an advertising light would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the lights were caused by genuine UFO's.  PD));33.2598;-80.8056
