2 lights of different intensity cross entire sky with one brighter than Mars. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 21:00:00;2 minutes;Two lights of different intensity cross entire sky with one brighter than Mars, Jupiter and no sound or marker lights I saw a white light go across the sky from one horizon to the other. It seemed to be at a lower altitude and followed at a consistent distance to a smaller light the whole time.  My wife and I didnâ€™t hear a sound. We watched planes at all altitudes all night and could even hear those at a very high altitude as I am in the outskirts of metro. It is dark and quiet. There were absolutely no other lights to these objects. No port starboard or marker lights of any kind. The brighter light was brighter than Mars and Jupiter and did not change in any way from the time we saw it till it disappeared. At first we thought a headlight on a plane however it went over and past us. It is not possible to see a light from behind a plane especially without a change in intensity and I am not an idiot. How could it be a three dimensional light and the object invisible? How could the light intensity not change in any way from horizon to horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.
