ARMY BASE;1970-08-14 02:20:00;4-5min;ARMY BASE WE WERE WAITING FOR A EARLY MORNING FLIGHT TO END SUMMER TRAINING AT A CADET BASE, AS IT WAS THE LAST NIGHT OF OUR SIX WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM THERE WAS NO CURFEW. ABOUT TWO AM MYSELF AND ANOTHER CADET WENT OUT SIDE AND STOOD ON THE ENTRANCE LANDING. IT WAS A VERY CLEAR NIGHT WITH LOTS OF STARS. I NOTICED WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PLANE OFF IN THE DISTANCE PASSING TO OUR LEFT. I SAID TO MY FRIEND THAT HE WOULD BE UP THERE TO IN A COUPLE OF OURS. JUST AFTER I SAID THAT THE LIGHT REVERSED COURSE 180 DEGREES AND APPEARED TO COME LOWER AND HEAD DIRECTLY FOR OUR BUILDING. WE BOTH SAID THAT IT WAS NOT A PLANE, AS IT GOT CLOSER WE COULD SEE THAT THE FRONT OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE A ROUND OBJECT HAD THREE LIGHTS THAT WERE WHITE AND WERE NOT FLASHING,THE OBJECT PASSED DIRECTLY OVER US, THERE WAS NO NOISE BUT WE FELT A SENSATION AS IT PASSED OVER US. ONCE PAST US THE OBJECT ACCELERATED AT A VERY FAST SPEED OFF TO OUR RIGHT TOWARDS THE HORIZON. IT MOVED EXTREMELY FAST AND WE LOST IT AMOUNG THE DISTANT STARS. WE NEVER MEMTIONED THIS TO ANYONE AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT HAS BEEN REPORTED. WE KNOW IT WAS NOT A HELICOPTER, TOO FAST, OR A PLANE, PLANES CANNOT TURN OR ACCELERATE AS THIS OBJECT DID. AS ARMY CADET STUDENTS WE WERE TRAINED IN SOME OBSERVATION SKILLS,THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE AT CAMP ALDERSHOT, NOVA SCOTIA ((NUFO;45.0806;-64.5012
