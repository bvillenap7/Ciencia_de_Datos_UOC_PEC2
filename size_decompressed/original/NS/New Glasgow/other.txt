Me and my one passanger on my left side were almost to the peak of the road when i noticed a large shinging light to my left I asked my passanger what the hell is that thing?. They responded with I dont know?.  We pulled over and viewed the object with two very bright lights, whiteish blue, flashing on an offset pattern horizontally from one another with no visable shape in the middle and flying very qucikly and at a very low altitude coming towards us. It was at about 10:10 pm EST and was very clear and dark ngiht with a few stars out.  We turned around in a drive way and started to assend down the mountin. I pulled over and looked back and the object was a minimum of 300 meters off the ground at the peak of the mountin hovering with both lights now staying on at the same time very brightly. We then drove away quickley to the bottom of the hill and turned right. This was 5 minutes into the viewing.I asked where is it? but it was nowhere in sight. 20 seconds later as we were driving towards melmerby beach road I saw the object now both lights flashing offsetly again coming towards us at a very low altiutde and quite rapidly. I have no idea how the oject got from the top of the mountin to infront of us in that short amount of time and with such grace. I periodcally asked my passenger  are you seeing this?, do you belive this?. We turned into a road on the left to park to again view the object coming towards us it was getting larger and larger, the closer it came. Both lights were now flashing at the same time and both were still bluish white. This was viewed in a heavily populated residential area but no other vehicles or people were visable to us. It was about 1000M away now and i turned left to go down the melmerby road back towards fraser mountin. I looked back and way the two lights now vertical from one another (one on top of the other with a space in between of darkness) as it the object wen! t straig ht up in the air. The radio began to crackle at this time. This was about 8 min into the viewing. We took a right and were in downtown new glasgow and then took another right and were on the road heading towards the power station in trenton. This is about 10 minutes after we first saw the object, we both looked to our right in the sky and the object was now visable in the sky at a quite low altitude. Once again the blueish white lights were falshing offsetly they were horizontal from one another again with the shape in the middle not visable. As we drove down this road both me and the passanger rolled down our windows and there was no noise whatsoever. The object slowed to a halt, it flipped verticaly so the lights were now one ontop of one another and for the first time we saw a very smooth, greyscale shape in the middle not very wide at all, liek a dumbell. The object the fly away very quickey and that was the last we saw of it. The viewing ended at about 10:23 PM EST.
