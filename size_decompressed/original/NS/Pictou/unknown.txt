SITINGS. IT FLEW VERY SLOW AT AN ESTIMATE OF 50 TO 100 KM/H AND FLEW ABOUT 200FT. OVER MY HOUSE AT A SLIGHT BANK TOWARDS THE EAST. IT WAS DEFINETLY NOT A SMALL PERSONAL PLANE BECAUSE OF THE SOUND IT MADE AND ITS ALTITUDE. I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE SOUND IT MADE BUT THE ONLY INCLING I HAVE OF WHAT IT MAY BE IS A STEALTH MILITARY AIRCRAFT BUT IT WAS FLYING TOO SLOW AND LOW TO BE SUCH THE CONCLUSION. SO I CLASSIFIED IT AS A U.F.O.! I HAVE A PICTURE BUT IT IS QUITE BAD AND I CANT TRUST YOU PEOPLE! THIS IS NOT BULLSHIT BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT HAS ALIENS ABOARD! EVERYONE ALWAYS THINKS THAT IF IT IS A U.F.O. THAT IT HAS ALIENS ABOARD! I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BUT UNTIL I HAVE CONTACT IT IS ONLY AN UNIDENTIED  FLYING  OBJECT!  ANYWAY..KEEP WATCHING THE SKIS!;45.6747;-62.7144
