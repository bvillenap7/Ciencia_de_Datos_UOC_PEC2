It was changing shape/color from bright to dark.  Eventually it rose very high in the sky and was still visible as a faint dark dot.  The object was traveling in the opposite direction to the local wind  direction. Several witnesses watched the object including two people from the Canadian Coast Guard who were alking by our location.  Total time watched was around 10 minutes until it disappeared into the clouds. No air traffic or sound was  recorded on my iPod Touch.  Unfortunately, the object is so small the camera cannot show an image. My gut feeling is that the object was a helium balloon someone released.  But why it traveled in the opposite direction of the wind is puzzling.;45.6747;-62.7144
