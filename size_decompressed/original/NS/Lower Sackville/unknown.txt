3 red vertical lights moving slow and silent over sackville.;2008-05-20 22:00:00;2;3 red vertical lights moving slow and silent over sackville. Went out on our doorstep one warm evening and my boyfriend and I saw three red lights, they were vertical and the light in the middle was slightly more to the left.  It moved very slow from west to east and made no noise.  It was flying very close to the ground and we could determine this because it moved behind the trees nearby. It was too dark to make out what shape it was but we will never forget it. Neither me or my boyfriend were under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
