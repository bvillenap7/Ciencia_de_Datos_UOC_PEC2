I told him to look, thats when we noticed that there were four...three flying in the shape > and one following (could possibly be an aircraft following as the flashing lights were more consistant).  Now they did kind of look like they could possibly be planes but they were way too close together....they had the flashing lights like an air plane but not consistant at all. They were moving east to west and moving very fast...we only watched them for approx 10 mins as we couldn't see anymore as there were trees in the way but I'm sure they were still going.;45.8367;-64.1879
