I'm always looking at the stars  on an early morning just before daylight I seen a big disc shape with a triangle shape piece in back that was looking as a piece of the disc was missing. It crossed the sky very fast high as the stars and as it passed two other. Star looking moving and crossing paths an disappeared as I could see and the disc went as far as I could see  I returned home and I was certain I was not outside that long but hours passed  did anyone else see this;45.8367;-64.1879
