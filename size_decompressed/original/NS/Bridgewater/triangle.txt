multi colored triangle;2002-08-18 02:00:00;5 to 7 mins;multi colored triangle At around 2 am myself and a couple of friends were camping at my parents cottage we were sitting by the beach and to the left over the channel and tree line i saw these diferent coloured lights seem to come together and make a triangle mass wich then moved over the trees fairly low and with no sound .i turned to my friend and asked h if he see,s the same thing as me and yes he did so we stood up amazed and watched it move across ther sky when my other friend ran to get her digital cam up at the cottage,but when she returned it was for gone across the sky and dissapeared out of our sight.my friend and i ran down the road to try and get another look but we were in  a pretty dense wooded area and couldnt really see through the trees.We waited up a few more hours but it never came back.we told some of the locals the next day but noone else had seen it.i was kinda reluctant to report this but less than a week ago  there was another sighting in nova scotia of the same damn thing in a place called cow bay.;44.3794;-64.5197
