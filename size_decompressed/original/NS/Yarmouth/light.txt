Four lights over Yarmouth Harbour that would blink off and on and move at rapid speeds and then remain motionless;2001-05-20 01:30:00;5 hrs;Four lights over Yarmouth Harbour that would blink off and on and move at rapid speeds and then remain motionless After midnight I was driving south down Main Street in Yarmouth when I noticed what looked to be a star out my driver's side window to the South East. I then thought the light must be a planet because it was so bright. I was marvelling at the brightness of the light when it all of the sudden became less and less bright until I couldn't see it. I was astonished and speechless. I pulled over to the side of the street in a parking spot. Not many people were around and there was only the occaisional taxi that was driving people home for the night. The light then came back on and was in the exact same spot as before. I scanned the same region of the sky and found what seemed to be three more stars of less brightness. For three minutes all the lights stayed in place. Then some of the lesser lights moved around at astonishing speeds as the very bright light stayed in place. It was like fireflies in the sky. Then the lesser lights stopped on dimes in the sky and remained still. They appeared to be elevated about 7500 ft to 10000 ft in the sky. It was hard to tell how large the craft or lights were. I was a little spooked by this and went to get a coffee around 2 a.m. in the morning. After getting out of the coffee shop around 3 a.m. the lights were still in sky. Every so often the lights would blink out and I could not see them. Then as soon as I thought they were gone they would reappear in the same vicinity. At one point three lights (the bright light along with two less bright lights) seemed to form a triangular formation. I was blown away by how still these lights were. The last time I saw the lights was at dawn over the Yarmouth Harbour. I will never forget this event during my lifetime.;43.8302;-66.1168
