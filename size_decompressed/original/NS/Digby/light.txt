RED LIGHT SEEN TRAVELING OVER WATER IN ANNAPOLIS BASIN.;2001-08-13 03:00:00;10 min;RED LIGHT SEEN TRAVELING OVER WATER IN ANNAPOLIS BASIN. well, a few years back myself and my female cousin were camping on bear island in the digby/annappolis basin.we were 13/14 years old at the time.(2001).we had to stay up because we had to wait for the tide to got out so were could catch the sand bar in the early morning hours.   It was about 3:00 am ,me and my cousin were just sitting there by the fire enjoing the nice calm night. when i noticed first the light about 1 meter above the water it was larger than a basketball glowing red,just at a steady speed coming closer. from the annapolis side. we thought it might have been a coastgaurd so we ran away from the fire and hid in the shadows and watched.  there was no sound ,no waves,no reflextion travilling way to fast and smoothly to be a boat, so we walked back and continued to watch it it was about 1 km or less away from the island .it went straight by us(infront of the island towards the digby gut) we lost sight as it went to far past us we ran around but there was no trace of it. it would have been at least 1/2 km away from digbys shores. i know there some crazy stuff goin on here ,there is just so much connection with everones sightings there pretty much all the same,  clear night ect.  my boy friend saw a blue light about 2 months ago with 2 of his friends it came at them then shot onto the trees when they started to run.    I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS FOR YEARS BUT I AM GETTING CLOSER WHEN I FOUND THIS WEBSITE I WAS SHOCKED TO READ ALL THESE SIGHTINS THAT WERE SO MUCH ALIKE!! THIS IS A GREAT WEB SITE. I ALSOCURRENTLY LIVE NEAR THE GREENWOOD BASE AND HAVE NOTICED AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF PLANES AND JETS FLYING OVER. ALSO THERE HAS TO BE A CONNECTION WITH TRIANGLES, AND CROP CIRCLES ARE A BIG ONE TOO, LIGHTS HAVE BEEN SEEN OVER CROPCIRCLES IN EVEN DAYLIGHT!  I THINK THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS ALOT MORE THAN WE THINK.AND I SAY WE CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR OUR ANSWERS.                       P.S THE LIGHT TRAVELLED ABOUT 65 KMS;44.5342;-65.7783
