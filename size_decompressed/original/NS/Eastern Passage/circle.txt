Strange gray circular lights making a low hum in sky;2005-07-19 23:30:00;15+mins;Strange gray circular lights making a low hum in sky This happened a couple of days ago. I didnt know where to report it and didnt want to go to the local news so i found your site.  I went outside for a bit to cool off because of the hot night and looked up and saw 3 dimly lit circular things in the sky. I at first thought it might have been spot lights but looking longer at it I ruled out the possibility that they were the spotlights. They were dimly lit, kind of a light gray and not a bright light it was like a haze over them, and were what looked to be 20 inches wide. They also moving in and out of the clouds and they looked like they would follow eachother and then sometimes they would hover apart from eachother for a bit. It wasn't a pattern to their movements either which made me also realize they couldn't have been spotlights.  I finished my smoke and went inside to wake up my boyfriend and tell him to come out and look at this. Then our neighbour was coming home and we called over to him and him and his wife also watched these things.  They seemed to give off a very low humm sound. It wasn't like anything really electrical we ever heard. It was something very very low but yet it was almost loud at the same time. It's very hard to put into words.  After watching these things for about 20 mins. we went in to get something to drink, the neighbours were already inside their home, but when we retured the things were gone and so was the sound.  unfortunetly we didn't have any film so no photo was taken.;44.617;-63.4871
