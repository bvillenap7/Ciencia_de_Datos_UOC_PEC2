When I came past the hill and was on the water front looking at the mouth of Halifax harbour I noticed that there was a ball of fire in the sky.  I could actually see what looked like smoke rising from what ever it was.  It was definetly a few hundred feet in the sky with nothing underneath.  I was able to see the reflection of the light from this object on the water.  I do not know how long this lasted, however, I watched the object in the sky stationary for about 10 minutes.  What I also noticed was another object which I believe may have been a helicopter circling the object counter clockwise.  I am confident it was circling because it would come from behind the object fly around in my field of vision, and then go back in behind.  The object was at least 1 or 2 Kilometers away from me and it was very large.  From the distance I was looking at it looked to be the size of a small building.  The color was steady orange and at the end the object simply faded out and disappeard, but I could still see the smoke that was coming from it disipating.  I could see the other object still circling with the stars in behind.  The other thing I forgot to mention was that this was a clear night with the Moon shining down.  This is the first and only time I have ever seen anything like this. It was definetly a new one to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));44.617;-63.4871
