We thought it was car lights but it got brighter and brighter.  There was a hum that you felt more than heard.  we went to the window to look and there was something coming towards us.  it had two vertical red lights on one side, two red vertical lights on the other side and one bright white light in the middle.  it came towards the house and got lower and lower.  At first we thought it was a plane but as it got closer and lower it looked more like two airplanes on top of one another.  it came so low we thought it was going to hit the house.  It flew over the house and we ran to the other window to watch it fly over the house and begin rising in the sky.  It just kept getting higher and higher until we could not see it any more.  I am not saying it was a UFO, but I am saying that we never saw or heard anything like it before.;45.62;-62.6158
