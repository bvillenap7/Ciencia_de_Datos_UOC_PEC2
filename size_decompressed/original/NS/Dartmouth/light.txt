They were round but the sky wasn't clear so the lights were slightly diffuse.  They converged to a single point and then diverged out to 4 endpoints creating a square if you were to connect them. The paths travelled by each light from the converged point out to the endpoints were not perfectly straight, but the complete motion was very symmetrical.  The convergence and divergence of the lights repeated many times.  Finally, the lights converged to a single point, which remained for 15 - 20 seconds, and then the light went out.

Flashing light over Dartmouth NS Canada;2010-09-01 21:30:00;2 minutes;Flashing light over Dartmouth NS Canada I was sitting on my back deck and I  looked up in the sky and saw an orb that flashed once, and then left, and I thought nothing of it. A couple minutes later I saw the orb again, and when I looked at it it quickly flew away. I was out with my father at the time, and he didn't see it, and he suggested it might be a sattelite, but sattelites don't fly away when you see them. I know it wasn't an aircraft too, because a few minutes before there had been a plane in the sky.;44.6759805555555;-63.5375722222221

My occupation as a truck driver did not prepare me for what I witnessed in the sky, behind where I live. I believe that my life-long interest of aviation however, has given me the ability to observe and determine the differences between conventional and non-conventional aircraft in flight. It was 02:05, Atlantic Standard Time, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, when I stepped outside and into my back yard to have a smoke. I was looking at the stars, as I often do, when they’re visible. That’s when I saw one of the stars moving at a fairly high rate of speed, South-East to North-West. Of course, I thought this to be a shooting star at first but the rate at which it moved through the air seemed too slow to be that. Then, to my astonishment, I noticed that the object was emitting a pulsating white light that engulfed it approximately every four seconds. The pulsations were also smooth. That is to say that it was like a dimmer switch being turned completely up, then back down again, to the almost off position. This dimmer effect would last about a second and a half between intervals. The object pulsated like that three times as it traveled across most of my field of vision. It emitted no sound even though it was completely silent in my neighbourhood. If the object had not done what it did next, I wouldn’t have been able to guess its size or its altitude. When the object moved to the far left of my view, it suddenly made an extremely sharp right-hand turn, North-East. No aircraft that I’m aware of could make such a turn at the apparent rate the object was traveling. I have never seen anything like it in my life. The object then disappeared into a nearby cloud.  I waited for it to emerge but it didn’t. Approximately ten seconds later, and to the right (South-East) of the cloud, there appeared a tremendous white flash, as if from a giant camera.  It was not lightning.  It was something else. Then, it was gone. The cloud appeared to be fifteen hundred to, two thousand feet from the ground and so I believe that the object was moving at a similar altitude as, it did not appear to change altitude during this observation.  I will admit that I do not know how far from my position the cloud was. At any rate, I should have been able to hear something if this was a conventional aircraft. I didn’t hear a thing.;44.6759805555555;-63.5375722222221

Some were hovering and way too close to be stars. Some were moving straight up into the sky and at least 4 of the lights were in a linear formation very close and moving in unison.   I stayed and watched for at least 10 minutes and went back out to look and most are gone but some remain.  Doesn't seem to be any pattern or shape of the lights.;44.6759805555555;-63.5375722222221

It frequently appeared and reappeared but always around the same area.  Sometimes it appeared to be making circles and the light would stay on.  Sometimes the light would be bright and prolonged and other times it would be faint and brief. It followed a very odd path.   I live close to an airport and a military base so I am used to seeing planes and helos.  If this is a helo, it can reach some pretty amazing altitude.;44.6759805555555;-63.5375722222221
