The object was very bright, and very still I did not see it move, to the eye it looked like a very bright white light, but after viewing a video I took, I noticed that in the video the object was actually Blue, Green and Red.  I have never seen anything like this an am very confused about what I saw.  I do have a video of the object hovering. Thanks;44.6759805555555;-63.5375722222221
