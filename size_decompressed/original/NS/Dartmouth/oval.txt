I leaned out my front window and smoked a cigarette and noticed a bright object hovering over the Woodlawn area of Dartmouth.  I was amazed and a little scared to be honest. I observed laser like beams leaving the (craft) or objectâ€¦ towards the ground every 20 minutes or so. I then woke my mother who also observed the object that I can only describe as an intelligently controlled craft.  There was no sound complete silence.  The object darted back and forth at a high rate of speed.  But stayed in one general area of the city.  It remained for over an hour. Periodically emitting beams towards the ground.  Then moved off at a high rate of speed towards the sky and disappeared.  The object seems to shift from one color to another and appeared to be saucer shape or oval. Smaller craft was briefly seen come from the ground and merge with larger craft  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;44.6759805555555;-63.5375722222221
