HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The object hovered and wobbled.;2003-12-04 21:00:00;approx: 1 minute;The object hovered and wobbled. I live in Nova Scotia.  This new sighting (my third currently) just happened a couple of months ago. It was a clear December night with lots of stars at around 9:00 p.m.. I believe Mars was out at this time and I remember attempting to find it when I first started to gather up the trash.  I was just coming up the back stairs to my apartment from taking the garbage out to the street when a yellowish/white glowing object caught my eye above and straight out towards me. I was standing facing my door and peering at the peek of the roof just above my head when this object began to (or continued) to travel towards me and over the peek of the roof.  Instead of going inside I waited until the object passed over my head. As it passed over me (I would say at least 5000 feet, I know this because I live near an airport) I followed it with my eyes until it rested adjacent to a tree limb in the foreground and the UFO in the background. It hovered for a moment and it began to wobble. This was very apparent. It was not a plane or helicopter, and this was very apparent. It moved smoothly with no sound, and when it hovered it wobbled. After about 1 minute of it wobbling beside the tree branch, it began to descend into the horizon. I went back down the stairs and followed it to the end of my parking lot until I lost sight of it again. It was moving quite fast.  Thank you to the witness for the reports.
