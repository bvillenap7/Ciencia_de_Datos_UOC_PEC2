Triangl shaped object;2002-08-21 21:15:00;1 minute;Triangl shaped object I was sitting in my backyard looking ito the night sky when I saw a triangular shaped object made up of three lights over head.  The lights on it were white like the stars but, all three lights were moving at the same speed and with no trail following them. From this I fell that the lights were one object It was moving with no sound and very fast.  As I called for others to come see it had moved behind a tree and never came out the other side.  Only momments after that there was three small aircraft  that slowly came over to the area that I had first seen the object.  They flew over the area for some time but I did not take notice of when they left.  There is an older airbase by my home and I am very use to aircraft in the night sky but the object that I saw was too fast to be any of the local aircraft that comes from there.;44.6759805555555;-63.5375722222221
THE PRT AND STARBOAD RUNNING LIGHTS;2009-02-17 19:00:00;walking dog;THE PRT AND STARBOAD RUNNING LIGHTS   SIR,  IT WAS ABOUT 19:00 WHEN I WAS WALKING MY DOG, I WAS WALKING NORTH ON BRIAN DR.  THIS OBJECT CAME OVER JUST ABOVE THE TREE TOPS AND SOUNDED LIKE A QUIET JET.   I THOUGHT AS I LOOKED UP FUNNY FOR AN A/C TO BE FLYING THIS LOW.  IT WAS HEADING NORTH AT A REAL GOOD CLIP.  IT HAD ONLY TWO RUNNUNG LIGHTS ON THE OUTWARD PART OF THE WINGS.  THE LIGHTS WERE RED AND GREEN BUT GET THIS, THE LIGHTS WERE ON THE WRONG SIDE.  RED WAS ON THE RIGHT AND GREEN WAS ON THE LEFT!   THE CRAFT WAS DARKER THEN THE NIGHT SKY AND HAD NO FLASHING STROBE LIGHTS LIKE OTHER A/C DOES.   I WAS A SAILOR IN THE RCN AND I KNOW THAT RIGHT IS GREEN AND LEFT IS RED, OR RATHER PORT AND STARBOARD.   IT WAS HEADING NORTH THE GREEN LIGHT SHOULD OF BEEN ON THE RIGHT NOT THE LEFT.   IN THE CANADIAN NAVY I HAVE TRAVELED IN MANY A/C I WAS EVEN STATIONED AT CFB SHEARWATER FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS SO I KNOW AIRCRAFT WHEN I SEE THEM, BUT THIS ONE STUCK IN MY HEAD.;44.6759805555555;-63.5375722222221
