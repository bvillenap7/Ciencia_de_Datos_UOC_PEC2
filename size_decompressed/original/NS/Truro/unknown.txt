Strange sight seen over nursing home.;2006-06-21 22:15:00;1 minute;Strange sight seen over nursing home. I am a healthcare provider in Truro and on the 21st of June 2006 was outside taking a break with a co-worker. Suddenly from the distance we spotted an object in the sky travelling at an astounding rate of speed and leaving behind a huge fiery tail. The tail had different colors but mainly consisted of a bright blue. It stretched from one side of the sky to the other and was 20 times wider than the trail a jet leaves! We heard no sound whatever and the object disappeared out of sight in a matter of seconds. Also as we pondered what this could have been we noticed there were numerous planes in the sky. Was this just an coincidence or were they looking for something?;45.37706;-63.25268
