I was outside having a smoke when I saw what looked like a large light in the sky I guess you could say a fireball.  At first I thought it was an airplane on fire but there was no sound.  It was very large in the sky, and it was moving quite quickly.  I got my parents and a pair of binoculars but it was to far away to see anything by then.  It also seemed like it was not moving in a straight line but rather traveled on a slightly curved path.   After 3 to 5 minutes it had moved out of sight.  I was not going to mention this but it was a box at the bottom of the report but a truck did stop working right as it passed by but other electroics in the area were unaffected so it may have been coincidence.  Also it was heading east if that is important.;45.37706;-63.25268
