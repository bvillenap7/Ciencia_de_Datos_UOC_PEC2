neon green, disappears and reappears;2007-06-27 03:00:00;8 min;neon green, disappears and reappears It was high up in the sky.... and florescent green. A long standing point of light... sputtering down. At first I thought it was a comet. Coming straight for us. Behind the clouds visible as they drifted past. It was there as least eight minutes... like a green cigar standing upright... and it looked as if it was coming straight for us at first. I tried snapping some pictures of it... and then it vanished completely.  ..then it appeared again... a little further away... still hanging an immense distance up in the atmosphere (indicating it would have to be miles tall, whatever it was) brilliantly neon green.
