A group of us observed red glowing objects moving in a v-shaped formation from north to south over the city. We were viewing this from a darkened backyard in the city. The intensity was moderate to faint on a night when the sky was exceptionally clear and the moon had not yet risen. The speed and distance appeared similar to the several satellites that passed over during the same time period (+ or – 30 minutes). The usual west to east parade of passenger jet aircraft was also easily visible during this time. The configuration of this relatively tight formation did not change noticeably during the viewing period. The spacing and colour led us to think that this may have been fragments of a satellite or a meteorite that had split up during entry into the earth’s atmosphere. The speed however, was slower than would have been expected from such an event.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227

Both between the hours of 9pm-11:30pm.  Still currently watching it now at 10:28pm Sept 8th.  Yesterday it was over one part of the city and this night it started a little farther to the left of where it was last night, but then slowly moved back and rotated a bit.  When I took photos and videos to nignt the image showed almost a beam or something coming from the object down on to the city;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
