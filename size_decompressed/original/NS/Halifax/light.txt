a fast, silent, bright flare-like light with constant velocity, trajectory and brightness;2001-08-12 00:35:00;15-30 sec.;a fast, silent, bright flare-like light with constant velocity, trajectory and brightness Sunday, Aug. 12, 2001. To whom it may concern:   At about 12:35 AM, I was just about to go inside after watering my plants and lawn when my eye was attracted to a bright mobile object appearing from the North over my neighbour's roof.  For 15-30 seconds or so, it sped across the clear sky in a straight line, leaving a substantial tail which dissipated fairly quickly as it crossed.  At first I thought it was a Navy type flare that some yahoo had set off for a lark.  It was the same size as such a flare and had the same velocity as those I have seen set off around here on New Year's Eve.  However, the light was a very bright white, not orange or purple.  After its rapid, soundless progress almost directly overhead, it disappeared from my view plane behind trees and a bright streetlight, having maintained its constant speed, trajectory, and brightness throughout.  I have no idea what it could have been, though I suspect that it was a large meteor or a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere.  It was probably nothing out of the ordinary, but it would be reassuring to have it identified. Please let me know if you have heard anything about it.  I can't believe that I was the only one who witnessed it. It was a real thrill!;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227

3 lit objects in triangle formation;2006-03-24 22:45:00;10mins;3 lit objects in triangle formation As I pulled into my driveway I noticed 3 lit objects in the sky flying in a triangle formation. They had bright green, red, and white flashing lights. The 3 objects were moving south and then changed direction and began moving east while keeping the same distance apart. As they got farther east, their triangle formation became more closed in. They moved down behind a large group of trees out of view, but then they came back up into view before going back down. This sighting lasted about 4-5 minutes. About 2 minutes later a single object identicle to the first 3 appeared where the first 3 had appeared. It began to move in the same direction as the first 3 before suddenly shooting downward leaving a streak of white light in the sky. Then it slowly made its way to where the first 3 had disappeared.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227

Bright stationary light seen from onboard a commercial airliner near Halifax, which got brighter then shut off.;2009-05-25 21:32:00;45 seconds;Bright stationary light seen from onboard a commercial airliner near Halifax, which got brighter then shut off. On Monday, May 25, 2009, while on board a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Brussels I looked out of my window toward the east and saw what I thought was a very large and bright star.  Briefly it appeared to become brighter and then suddenly it shut off as if someone had turned off a light switch.  It never re-appeared after this.  According to the onboard navigation screen in the cabin, I estimate we were approx. 25 to 35 miles off the coast of Nova Scotia and approx. 50 to 75 miles North/Northeast of Halifax. We were at approx. 33,000 feet.  I estimate the object was at about 38 to 40,000 feet and approximately 5 to 10 miles off to our right (toward the east). The time was exactly 20:32 EST on my watch and it would have been 21:32 AST. The event happened so quickly that I do not know if anyone else on the airplane saw it. Most of the passengers were either sleeping or watching the TV screens in the cabin. In Brussels, I saw the pilots in the airport and asked if they'd seen it.  They said they hadn't, but briefly heard other aircraft in the area talking about it on the radio.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
Bright white light bobbing across the sky for about 1 min over Dartmouth Nova Scotia Canada, Sept 22nd;2009-09-22 20:20:00;1 min;Bright white light bobbing across the sky for about 1 min over Dartmouth Nova Scotia Canada, Sept 22nd At about 8:20pm on Sept 22nd 2009 I was walking out to my car and looked up to wish upon a star, (the evening star, the only big and bright star in the southern sky) I looked down and a few seconds and then looked up again looking towards the East and I saw what appeared to be the same star in front of me, but then I realized that I could still see the first star out of the corner of my eye. (I wish upon this same star everynight after work so it is always in the same place in the sky, at this time of year)  I joked to my friend to look at the UFO in the sky and he looked up and stopped laughing at me. He saw the same bright white light that I did and we stopped walking and witnessed it “bounce” across the sky.  There was no flashing lights like a commercial aircraft, no sound and it was not moving in a straight line, but bobbing up and down as it moved away from us slowly like it was going up and down on waves in the sea. After about 30 seconds to a minute of observation, we witnessed it just fade away. I thought I noticed it dip slightly and turn further to the east just before it faded. My friend thought it was far away and moved at high speed away from us, and thought it was outside our atmosphere. I thought it was much lower in our atmosphere, maybe only 5,000 – 10,000 feet up, as I am an amateur Astronomer and have looked at the moon and comets through both binoculars and a small telescope and frequently lie back and watch planes go over head, I know how high a plane is when it is flying the North Atlantic great circle route probably 35,000 feet up, you have to tilt you head way back almost to lose your balance, this object was an easy glance up, maybe only 45 degrees up from the horizon. The sun was fully down, so I don’t expect this was a reflection, I have never observed anything like this in the daytime or nightime sky before, my friend guessed it might be a flare if it was as low as I thought, but it was not losing altitude, it was maintaining it’s forward speed and altitude like a powered craft would. I believe in life in the universe, but have a hard time believing this was anything other worldly, but I’d love to see if anyone else noticed this object over Dartmouth Nova Scotia, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Long, strait, bright, green light above the clouds.;2010-04-21 21:30:00;2.5 hours;Long, strait, bright, green light above the clouds. Wowzers!  I was working in downtown Halifax when I looked up into the sky and saw a long, strait, bright, green light above the clouds that was stationary.  At one point it simply vanished, then I saw it again in a different place in the sky - a good deal further than where I had originally seen it!   I've read that someone in Halifax had this experience in 2007, and I just thought I'd report what I saw. I think I will contact Dal and SMU tomorrow, just in case one of the universities was responsible, but I doubt it! I have to wonder, WTF it was!

One small line was spotted by two friends and I in the North end of Halifax.  It was almost neon green and pulsed in brightness from very bright to invisible.  The object was stationary and was about an inch long.  The longest sighting was maybe 30 seconds.

Bright white/orange light over Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada Mar 29/11;2011-03-29 21:45:00;1min 50 secs;Bright white/orange light over Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada Mar 29/11 This is the 2nd time I saw this thing from my bedroom window over the Bedford Basin. It doesn't move up or down nor side to side. It doesn't get bigger or smaller but just hovers in one spot and then is gone in the blink of an eye. Actually, I video'd this experience but it ended when I slipped off the bed (laugh, it's okay, I certainly did) and the five to ten seconds it took to get back in the window, this thing was gone. It disappeared in a flash just as it did the first time I had seen it. I've never seen a plane over the Basin and living in the area of the city, I hear all the noise from helicopters or the rare plane that flies over.  I live close to a container yard that was directly below where I saw the object.  I can hear the containers being loaded and unloaded onto large ships but I could not hear any noise coming from this object. It was one white/orange ball of light that looked fairly large in the night sky.  While watching the video it looks like there may be three distinct lights horizontal to one another and very close together.  Aside from the white and orange, I could also see reds and blues flashing from it.  Blue is not a normal colour from an airplane. I posted the video to my Facebook account and everyone who has watched it, cannot identify what the object is.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
Small bright red light surrounded by a blue/purplish halo or ring;2014-10-20 18:55:00;3 minutes;Small bright red light surrounded by a blue/purplish halo or ring It was just about twilight hour, however not dark enough to see any stars yet. I was walking on Bayer’s road near Joseph Howe when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I looked up to see a small bright red light in the sky.  It was stationary and was surrounded by a larger bright blue/purplish ring. It almost appeared like a halo around the smaller light. Both light sources were constant and not blinking. It stood still and made no noise. After about a minute it started to move very slowly in an almost fluid motion that didn’t have any real pattern.  It started going left then turned around and went right, then up and down and then spun around in almost a circle.  At certain moments between changing directions it would stay stationary for a few seconds.  As it started to go right one last time, the halo disappeared and the light turned to blue before it faded and disappeared.  Then very quickly it appeared once as a bright red light with the halo bef! ore it blinked and disappeared.  I stayed around for a few minutes and walked around but didn’t see it again.  The entire experience lasted about 2-3 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
