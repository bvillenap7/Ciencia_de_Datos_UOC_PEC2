In what seemed to be very high in the sky (outer space) we saw a yellow sphere moving very slowly among the stars, then after 4 seconds the sphere blinked out. No noise, not a satellite not a shooting star or meteor. Appeared to travel very slowly and blinking out after 5 seconds of sight. my friend saw it three times, I saw the object once for 4 seconds then blinked out. very similar to report in woodlands california reported on this site...  thnks.
