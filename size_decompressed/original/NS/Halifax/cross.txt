We went for a late evening walk in Point Pleasnt Park here in Halifax. The woods were dark and the air cold but calm. As we came about a corner of the walking trail we were on, over the horizon of the north west sky we noticed an odd light in the sky about a kilometer away from us and nearly the size of a large star. We stood nearby for about 5 minutes as it came closer to us and as it did, different colors came visible on the shell of the craft. Blue, Red and Green colors swirrled around the outside of this thing. Not much of a sound came out of it due to the sound of the Harbour and cars in the distant. Although the craft was a defined X shape it moved slowly across the sky up untill it hit the shore and shot off at a acceleration that we had never seen before. Blue light was seen in its speed across the sky, its trail. Though this is not the first UFO sighting I have seen, Its the most odd.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
