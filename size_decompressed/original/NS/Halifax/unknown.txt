August 24, 2007 1:30 am bright green/blue light steaks appear in sky  over Halifax, NS at  RNSYS. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2007-08-24 01:45:00;60 minutes;August 24, 2007 1:30 am bright green /blue light steaks appear in sky  over Halifax, NS at  RNSYS. August 24, 2007  While walking on the dock closest to the club house at the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron we noticed a bright green/blue light in the sky.  It was approximately 1:30am.  We first thought that it might be an airplane however after closely watching we noticed that it did not move.  We were facing N / NW and the lights were at approximately 11 o’clock in the sky.  We watched for about 1.5 hours and during that time the light streak not move at all it stayed stationary.  The light streak was about 5-10 miles long and at quite a height.  The sky was partly cloudy and the light streak appeared to get longer, shorter, dimmer and brighter as the clouds passed over.  The lights looked not unlike long green glow sticks in the sky.  This light did not move like a satellite, falling star, meteorite or plane, it had to be something well above the cloud cover moving in sync with the rotational spin of the earth.  Comparing it to a jet plane con trail, it would have had to be much higher than a commercial jet, and unlike a jet con trail it did not deteriorate at all over the 1.5 hours. At the end it was covered by cloud cover for about 5 minutes and when the cloud cover cleared it was gone and wasn’t seen again ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??
