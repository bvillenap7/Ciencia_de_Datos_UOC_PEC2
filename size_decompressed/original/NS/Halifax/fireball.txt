At about 1245 am we saw a fireball travelling north to south above us on a clear night.We could see 3 jets of flame and smoke the middle one being brighter than the right and left one which were the same unvarying brightness.It made no sound allthoght it was quite bright and travelled in a even straight line.I have seen a fireball meteor years ago but it was very irregular with chunks falling off. This sighting looked more like a rocket or something.Last seen heading into the atlantic ocean south of Halifax Nova Scotia.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
A bright green fireball in the sky that lasted only seconds.;2001-09-01 22:00:00;Seconds;A bright green fireball in the sky that lasted only seconds. I apologize for the poor time line. This event happened at night somewhere between September of 2000 and 2003. I cannot recall what season.  I was walking and saw a large green fire ball in the sky. It was in full motion when it appeared and disappeared, and did so almost instantaneously. The event lasted only seconds. It seemed to be traveling towards earth and west.  It happened to the north of Halifax. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227

Then I realized this was no comet or or shooting star.  It stopped very suddenly and let down 2 more fireball's. Wierd I was thinking. It stopped for only 4 more mintues but that was long enough for me to get what was happening.  It was emitting long beams of light in a pattern 1,2. then stop 3,4. then stop.  I hurried inside to get my binoculars but by the time I came out it had started moving again.  The other two Fireball's went in opposite directions. One east and one south.

Two red orbs over home in Halifax.;2015-10-10 22:30:00;5 minutes;Two red orbs over home in Halifax I am an apprentice aircraft maintenance engineer.  Tonight two red orbs flew over my home.  I was going outside for a cigarette and witnessed them fly northeast over my home. I then ran inside to grab my phone but was unable to get in time to get any footage.  I ran to the street in front of my home to see them far in the distance down the street, the orbs now heading south west.  One orb faded while the other seemed to hover for a while, fading after around 20 seconds.   I work on commercial aircraft almost every day, I saw no machine just two orbs of red light.  It is a surprisingly clear night here in Halifax, so I have no reference to size or altitude.  They approached very quickly and were too far to film in the 20 seconds it took to get my camera.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
