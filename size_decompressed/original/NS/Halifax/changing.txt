The Dark sky night made a clear image of this weird shape object. It was the brightest blue I had ever seen coming from the sky. Whenever it turned Bright blue it seemed tp turn towards me making an oval shape in a way. As time went on it became much smaller than when I first saw it.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
Yesterday evening my girlfriend and I where at the bayers lake movie theatre , walking over to target I noticed a very bright what look;2014-09-19 19:30:00;3-4 minutes;Yesterday evening my girlfriend and I where at the bayers lake movie theatre , walking over to target I noticed a very bright what looked like a star as it was sundown I knew it couldn't possibly be a star * we were facing north east that is the direction of the sun setting* This object looked like it was floating it was 100% moving as if it was slowly moving downwards  To my shock of this object I started to look for anything else  To my surprise I noticed 2 other objects the original object started to change from a dot on the sky to somthing a little long and thin and somthing broke off and fell faster down wards, the second object shot across the horizan I can only say it had a tail as it moved across the sky red as if it was burning, this thing was moving fast.   The 3rd object stayed NW of my location and didn't move untill the 2nd object that was shooting across looked like it changed direction to what I can only explain in the 3d sence that it started to move out, not up or down but out as if it was heading off our planet I can't explain more then that but I so have 2 pictures that really don't do any justice to my experience I hope someone else saw this incredible phenomenon;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
