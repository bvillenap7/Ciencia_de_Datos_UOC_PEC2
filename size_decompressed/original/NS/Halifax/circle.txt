Moving stars and V-shaped craft.;2014-03-25 06:00:00;30 minutes;Moving stars and V shaped craft. At 6 am, seen what looked like a star fly away, out of sight only to return a couple minutes later going opposite way and fly out of site.   Approx 20 later, I was walking and seen a low flying V shaped object with 5 to 7 lights on bottom green, yellow, orange.   It seemed to be turning after the turn, it just had lights like a regular plane.  The closet thing I could Find online that looked like it was a flying wing, but this was more V shaped.  Some artist rendering of the phoenix lights were spot on.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
Round circular pattern of lights yellow/orange, 6 with 1 red in the middle and multiple red slow pulsing lights.;2015-01-14 23:46:00;12 minutes;Round circular pattern of lights yellow/orange, 6 with 1 red in the middle and multiple red slow pulsing lights, randomly between the yellow/orange lights.   There was no audible sound, the sky was very clear, the object moved slower than what a plane would need to keep airborne.   I do have a photoâ€¦.it was taken with a Nikon D700 with a 24-120 lens - the image was at full zoom.  I wish I would have gotten the when it was above.   Normal air traffic flies over Halifax on a dedicated NE route.  This object was flying in an unusual direction.  It was heading 80 degrees east from my position.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
