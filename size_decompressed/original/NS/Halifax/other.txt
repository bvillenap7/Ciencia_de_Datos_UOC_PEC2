big, very bright and traveling slow;2002-08-18 04:24:00;50 secs;big, very bright and traveling slow Could not sleep, so I got up to go get a drink.  I looked out my window and saw it going by.  If I were to put my baby finger up in front of my face, and look out the window, it would be the size of my finger-nail.   It was big.  It freaked me out so bad that I could not go back to sleep, I just kept looking out the window to see more.   Then I remembered that the asteroid was to pass earth last night, but everything that I checked on the net led me to believe that there was no way I could have seen what I saw, and so big, with my naked eye.  And it was not traveling very fast.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
Bright morphing light disk thing… ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly not a serious report?  PD));2004-09-10 01:00:00;5 to 7 minutes;Bright morphing light disk thing... There was a large very bright light in the sky, not unlike seeing a streetlight at street level, except the craft was just above the jorizon, maybe 10 km away. We watched it for a few minutes, move back and forth very slowly across the sky, then it seemed to 'morph'into a blinking light, then a disk, which the metal could be clearly seen, as well as three lights, one in the middle one on each end, all white, and flew away. At this point, there was another bright light in the sky, but it disappeared. Apparently, things like this were visible across the city. The next night, the same bright light was visible for awhile, stationary this time, then the same disk type thing flew across the sky. The night after this, there were a lot of planes, seemingly military type, in the sky, around the area.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly not a serious report.  No date indicated for event.  Time and date of alleged sighting are unknown to NUFORC.  We have assigned an arbitrary time and date.  PD));44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
So much to say and so little space. Odd Dark object flying from Dartmouth out of Harbour, not a bird!;2005-06-11 01:30:00;20 min;So much to say and so little space. Odd Dark object flying from Dartmouth out of Harbour, not a bird! This would be my second viewing of what I would call a UFO sighting. I once sighted something out of the ordinary here in Halifax while walking in Point Pleasnt Park after hours when the park was closed. Although you are not allowed to be in the park after hours a few friends of mine liked to play childish games in the dark with flashlights, usually in the fog. I was facing I believe south looking over the North West Arm ( a body of water in the Halifax Harbour ) Where something caught my eye, This had been back in 2003, at the time I didnt think too much about it, mainly because I didnt want to get caught by my friends. The time was about 11 PM and the night was foggy. A blue blob moved from avove me from the north side of the water to the south in a quick swift motion. It went pretty fast. Becasue it was foggy i didnt see any shape to it just an odd blue color, like looking into a CD or something. But this was not the report I was looking to submit. Two nights ago I was awake and feeling bored, I went out for a walk down the waterfront here in Halifax and sitting on the boardwalk near the Metropolis building, or what I refer to it as, I seen an odd dark spot move across the sky from the dartmouth area to the harbour entrance. I'm guessing it went East to west. No sound and not moving fast. No lights and no real shape. really it looked like a huge blackish shaddow moving across the sky. I did have my Digital camera with me and I did manage to capture a video of this event but when I tried viewing the video on my PC I seen nothing in the video. I was not going to say anything about this sighting becasue people dont seem to believe in UFO, but what I seen 2 nights ago was not a plane, it had no lights and no shape, Was not a bird, only seaguls fly at night and I've seen my share of them flying here at night, plus they would show up on this video. My video is a mere 20 seconds long becasue it was done on my Digital cam.. Anyone else see anything like this?;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
Green line in the sky shaped as a straight line;2010-07-10 23:15:00;Aprx. 5 - 10 mins;Green line in the sky shaped as a straight line UFO SIGHTING August 13, 2010  Three days ago(August tenth) I went to the store to get a pack of smokes , only to find out that the store was closed so I went to different one . It was nice out so I took a longer route , which was up over a hill  As I was walking up this hill something in my peripherals caught my attention.  I looked up immediately and what I seen was a green line of light in the sky . Not very large and very sharp.  It almost looked like a small LED light.  I stopped to look at for about a minute when I got to the top of the hill, to make sure I just wasn’t seeing things.  I also Noticed a plane in the sky flying by. After about a minute of looking at the object. I walked down the other side of the hill to the store to get smokes.  The farther down the hill I went the less I could see it, until it disappeared.  I came back the same way I came to see if I could still see the object.  Unfortunately it was gone and I walked home puzzled at what I had saw.  I think It could be similar to the report on July 19, 2010.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
