There was a whilte glow around it, shiny metallic material could be seen through the glow, it was low enough to see good.;2005-07-15 22:15:00;4 minutes;There was a whilte glow around it, shiny metallic material could be seen through the glow, it was low enough to see good. At around 10:15PM Atlantic Canada time July 15th 2005, four adults ages 17 to 45 and four children ages 5 to 10 years old were out enjoying the night air in the city of Halifax Nova Scotia outside in the parking lot of our apartment building. I noticed what looked like a glowing star coming from out of the west heading east at a high rate of speed, but not so fast that it couldn't be tracked with the naked eye, I  said to the others what is that? The object was almost overhead and I ran into the apartment building to grab my binoculars to get a better look. After I looked I passed the binoculars to my neighbor to have a look while I was standing there in awe at what I saw. All four adults got to see it with the binoculars. I saw a glowing white object triangular shaped with a metal surface with what looked like black waves in the metal. it was only a matter of minutes and it vanished out over the Atlantic Ocean, Then we saw another object out over the ocean in the distance heading from the north to the south at a high rate of speed, there was a plane in the air to the north that looked as if it was heading in the same direction, but it was much slower then what appeared to be the second object, I also saw the second object with the binoculars. Around these objects there was what looked like a white glow, like a florescent light, the light didn't look attached to the object, but looked more like it emanated around the object.The object that few over head did not make any noise at all, we all agreed it wasn't a plane or helicopter as the airport is not far from here and we see planes all the time with there flashing lights, we don't know what the closest object we all seen was, but whatever it was, it was quite a sight to behold through binoculars going overhead.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
The lights flew acrossed the sky faster then any shooting star/meteor shower i have ever seen, moved back and forth acrossed the sky.;2011-05-21 01:27:00;20-40 Minutes;The lights flew acrossed the sky faster then any shooting star/meteor shower.  I have ever seen, moved back and forth acrossed the sky. We all saw around 36 lights that looked like ships flying, the lights were in groups of 3 and the groups looked like they stayed together so I assume the ship was triangular.  I was with 7 other people walking home from a show late at night.   No alcohol or drugs were consumed.   Only one of the people with us did not see it because he was in a phone booth making a call.  He noticed static on the phone line when we saw the ship approximately.;44.6516781746035;-63.6216347222227
