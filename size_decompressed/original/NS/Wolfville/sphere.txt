I stopped ridding for a break and stretched out on a stump and looked up into the sky watching dragon flies. I spotted a round orange light quite high in the sky, well over 200ft because it was difficult to spot when I turned my head for a minute. I thought it may have been an air craft but it was hovering rather than moving across the sky. I realized it was a metallic object as the sunlight reflected off it, rather than a light. I watched for 15 minutes and it only seemed to get smaller as if it was moving out ward. It was still there when I left.;45.0791;-64.3748
