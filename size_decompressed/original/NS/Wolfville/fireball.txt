There were dogs barking from somewhere down the street and my radio that had been previously off kept was kicking in and out, I went to my kitchen window to look out into the back yard. I had no sooner reached my window when there was a loud bang. The light disappear and the dogs that had been barking quieted down. In the morning I went out into the backyard to look at my window I found the screen a couple of feet away from the window it had been ripped off it's frame.;45.0791;-64.3748
