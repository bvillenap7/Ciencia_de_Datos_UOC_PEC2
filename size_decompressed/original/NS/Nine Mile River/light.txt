Green light paced my pickup truck on rural road, then sped off and headed east towards the atlantic ocean.;2008-10-15 21:00:00;1 minute;Green light paced my pickup truck on rural road, then sped off and headed east towards the atlantic ocean. I was heading to my parents in my pickup with my wife (girlfriend at the time).  We were driving along a section of unpopulated road with trees on either side.  A flash caught my eye as I was cruising along, but I didn't think anything of it at first.  The flash was green, and my dash lights in the pickup were green. There was another flash and we both looked at the same time.  This green light was pacing my truck to the left side.  I was headed due north, so the object was to my west.  It just appeared to be a single green light, low to the ground (10 feet over the tree tops)   My wife and I were both puzzled and both of us were like WHAT IS THAT?! I slowed down a little, and it slowed down, then I stood on the accelerator, and it sped up with us.  Then it tore off to the north, cut over the road about 1/2 a mile up in front of us and went east out of sight. It was cloudy, so no other aircraft were visible.  The green light also made no sound at all (truck engine was quiet, windows were cracked a little to allow air in)  I have NEVER seen anything like that before, and hope to never see anything like that again. Times are dates are approximate.  It was in the fall of 2008, because I had just bought the truck we were driving in. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
