Shapeshifting light seen by 2 teenagers at night;2006-05-07 22:50:00;5-7 minutes;Shapeshifting light seen by 2 teenagers at night  500 Lights On Object0: Yes My friends and I were playing Man Hunt (tag in the dark, pretty much) when I sighted a small ball of light moving across the sky. It was white, glowing dimly, moving straight across the sky at an arm's length, it was about the size of a pinhead.  A few seconds later, it stopped in the middle of the sky, and I asked my friend if he could see it too.  He said he could, and as I looked back the object quickly grew in size. I am unsure if it came closer or it just grew at the original distance, but it became equal to the size of a basketball at arm's length.  It stayed like this for about 2-3 minutes, then it vanished in an instant.  There were no sounds or additional light sources, and I have seen satellites in the sky before this was no satellite.  Afterwards I do not remember how much time may or may not have actually pasted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));45.5327;-64.0373
