Blue Light rockets up into space;1998-09-25 23:00:00;5 seconds;Blue Light rockets up into space I was standing with my old x-girlfriend on her step one night, I could hear a nise like a motor which was probably a car a few hundred yards away out of sight and was lookign in the direction, then I looked aboke me in the sky and saw an off-circle, almost oval Blueish Light about maybe 500 meters above. It was like the shape and size of a street light as you would see it from below. and It was almost the same color as a blueish street light aswell. It was much larger than a street light, but it looked that large from the distance. I saw it in place for a few seconds, then It shot up into the sky like a rocket and got smaller and smaller and gone in a matter of seconds. unfortunately my x-gf didnt see it, nor anyone else I told me story to.
