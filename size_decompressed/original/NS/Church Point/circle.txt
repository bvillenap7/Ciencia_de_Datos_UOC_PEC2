Saw a bright red flare like object looking off my deck to the NNE. It was between the North Star and the horizon. It was approx three times brigter than the star and very vivid. I did a double take when I realized it was moving. Looked very far away but moving at a high rate of speed much faster than a conventional aircraft. It was moving ENE what looked to be level with the horizon. I poked my head inside for a sec and hollared to my wife to come and see. I looked back out and saw that it was tracking away from me. It got a little more faint and seemed to flicker once or twice and disappeared. It was not below the horizon yet but there was very slight cloud (cirrus) but not that low to the horion from what I could tell. The object seemed ro pick up speed just before it vanished. Of course my wife missed it. I love to star gaze, watch meteors and am an avid aircraft buff. I've never seen anything like this before and am fairly certain it was not one of those. I really hope I hear about it on the news tomorrow. I wish I could have snapped a picture!;44.3002;-66.1532
