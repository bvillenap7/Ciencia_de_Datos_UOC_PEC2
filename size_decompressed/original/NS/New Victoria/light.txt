3 Lights chase a car in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.;2006-08-20 23:30:00;15 minutes;3 Lights chase a car in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. About 11:30 pm late August 2006 there was a strange orange light high in the sky above the ocean near New Waterford. As I drove to New Victoria the light came much closer, it was HUGE. Then out of nowhere 2 more of the same bright lights appeared & by this time 4 cars stopped to watch. It hovered, then moved side to side not making a sound. As it got closer and closer i guess we all panicked. Hit the gas and the lights started to follow, then a few minutes later the lights shot past the car. 3 HUGE lights, no sound whatsoever. I turned down my street and when i was halfway down, i stopped and watched it hover over the woods nearby. After another few minutes of this it was getting too close. Terrified, i hit the gas and booted it home. A friend happened to be driving by and then i saw her car stop dead on the road. Heh, they saw it too. I was home at this point, expecting my friends to show up shortly after but they kept driving. Her boyfriend says the lights hovered, moved a bit, then dissapeared a few minutes later.
