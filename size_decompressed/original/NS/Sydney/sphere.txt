I was outside around 5:40 pm Wednesday December 12, 2012, and saw suddenly a bright orb shaped ball of light come from the South across the Ashby area headed North and when it got over harbour it burst into a big green flash/glow and then turned orange/red and disappeared.  This this wasn't no shooting star and wasn't any higher than a thousand feet up.  I could see this ball as plain as day and not a sound.;46.1296132450332;-60.1945086092714
Mothership and Two Orbs;2015-01-10 18:20:00;2 minutes;Mothership and Two Orbs I went outside around 6:20 p.m.,  and observed two satilites that were about to pass each other like headed in opposite directions.  (N-S).  I noticed a flash in the corner of my eye and looked and there was nothing there.  I glanced back up at the satiltes and when i looked back over where i saw the flash there were 2 brigh lights sitting vertical.  They began moving South and began to climb and started to roll and tumble faster and faster as it fell deeper into space.   When i lost site of the lights there was a blue flood light came on for about 2 seconds and went out and repeated a 2 second blue light.  I could see a craft moving North.  Only for that blue light i wouldn't have see it.  It was higher than jetliners fly yet the light were right in front of me.;46.1296132450332;-60.1945086092714
