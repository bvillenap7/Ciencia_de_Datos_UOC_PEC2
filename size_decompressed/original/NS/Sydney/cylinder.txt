Bright cylindrical craft flew northward over Sydney, Nova Scotia;2010-07-08 19:25:00;2-3 minutes;Bright cylindrical craft flew northward over Sydney, Nova Scotia Sighting happened on July 08, 2010, at approximately 7:25 EST in Sydney, Nova Scotia. The sky was still quite bright. A single object was observed flying northward at a high altitude.  I canâ€™t say precisely what the altitude was, but I would estimate it approximately the same, maybe somewhat lower, than the passenger jets I see in the sky at high altitudes which leave the vapour trails in their wake.  I would also estimate it to have been approximately 8 to 10 times the size of those planes.  It moved very quickly and made no discernable sound and left no trail. The object appeared to be mostly white in color, possibly glowing or having a shiny reflective surface.  It appeared to be cylindrical or cigar shaped with a dark line or area at its center, with brighter areas at each end.  No flashing or blinking lights were observed, though there appeared to be a mild haze around it. Both my son and I observed the object until it disappeared from view.  Once it moved away from us it appeared as just a dot of light in the sky and it eventually vanished.  It flew in what appeared to be a straight line and made no manoeuvres of any kind.;46.1296132450332;-60.1945086092714
