Light overhead in Sydney Nova Scotia;1990-01-15 22:00:00;Maby 1 minute?;Light overhead in Sydney Nova Scotia I was about 13 years old. With a bout 5 of my best friends. I my younger brother was there with his younger friends. We used to go sleddingdown snowy hills in the winter at the top of our Street in Sydney, Nova Scotia. It was dark and cold and everyone was having fun. I remember being at the top of the hill, with a friend getting ready to slide down. We did, when we got to the bottom, we stood up and just as we were turning around. I noticed a really, really fast light streak towards us from over the trees. You see, I lived in a part of a city that is just on the border of county area. So, behind this hill was a vast forest. Anyway, just as fast as I saw the light, it was over all of us. I cast a extreemly powerfull WHITE light on all of us. I remeber looking around as this was happening and noticing that the light had boundries. It seemed circular and to be just around all us kids. I then remeber everything get REALLY REALLY quiet and then I remeber looking at my friend who was with me. He fell to the ground, perhaps in shock, I don't know. Then, I started to look up, it felt like slow motion cause I was really nervous. Just I started to look up, he streaked away, very fast. Immediatly, all the kids started screaming and crying and everyone ran down the street to their homes. We were terrified. We told our parrents and they called the police, but nothing ever came about it. Its a pretty tramatic story for a number of those that were there, and some wont talk about what that saw. I dont mind. Pretty amazing, it changed my veiw on things. 15 witnesses is alot. This is only one of the many witness I and others had in Sydney on different occations. Very odd things happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  NUFORC received a similar report from a mother in Traverse City, MI, regarding a disc-shaped object that approached four children sledding on a nearby hill on December 29, 1994.

Strange tumbling lights in sky.;2015-01-10 18:30:00;15 seconds;Strange Tumbling Lights in Sky I was outside around 6:30 pm December 10, 2015, and  a bright flash caught my perrifferal vision.   When I looked up, I saw 2 lights over top of each other, and were a distance apart.  Then they started to roll or tumble in the sky, all the while staying exactly the same distance apart.   I best discribe it as a baton with a light on either end.;46.1296132450332;-60.1945086092714
