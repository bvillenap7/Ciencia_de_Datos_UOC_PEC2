very high green fireball very high velocity;2008-02-19 02:15:00;15 seconds;very high green fireball very high velocity I went outside to smoke a cigarette two nights ago. I walked up the steps of my apartment and looked up. I sparked the cigarette then looked back up at all the constellations. It gets dark enough here to where you can see the Milky Way galaxy... so yeah, there are LOTS of stars of every color in the spectrum... compared to Miami at least.  Earlier in the night I was out with my laptop on Stellarium just star gazing, it is a hobby of mine.  The last time I reported a UFO everyone laughed at me and told me it was a satellite but this time I am certain that I didn't see a satellite.  As I was looking up I noticed something fly really fast from above my apartment's roof. It traveled VERY fast across the sky but not as fast as shooting stars do. It was faster than any passenger jet I've ever seen.  It shined with the intensity of Venus and flickered more than any star in the sky. But what made it different is that it was a brilliant green. Green on the rim and white in the center. It traveled across the sky and into the horizon in at least 15 seconds.  It looked sort of like a roman candle or a flare shot going off but it was way to high to be either and traveled at a constant velocity. I don't know what to make of it so far.;46.1296132450332;-60.1945086092714
