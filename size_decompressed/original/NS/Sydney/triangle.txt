July 14, 2019  UFO â€“ Sighting 2018 Sydney, Nova Scotia  	I cannot exactly recall the date but I think it was sometime in April or May of 2018. I thought I would share the experience. 	I have a business in the McCurdy Sydney Airport here had just started to drive home around 9PM. When I got to the end of the airport road and turned onto the main highway I noticed blinking lights to my left side, sort of just over the tree line.  There are towers in the area and I chalked it up to that. 	As I proceeded on my drive, I realized these lights are still there and moving.  What I seen was simply three lights blinking just off timing of each other but were consistent in blinking time and distance apart. The distance apart seemed to be massive much larger than an aircraft. 	I could not see anything other than the light. I saw them continue on right over the city of Sydney.  Once I got onto the TransCanada Highway, I lost them but when I got into Sydney River (5 minutes away) I spotted them again over the mountain range.  I got onto my final road (route 4) and watched the light go out of sight over the mountains. 	This is very unusual and I feel lucky to have seen these lights.  I was expecting to wake up and hear news reports of this but nothing.  This went right over the city!  	I am still amazed about it and will always wonder what it was.;46.1296132450332;-60.1945086092714
