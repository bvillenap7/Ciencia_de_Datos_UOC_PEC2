SEEN STRANGE MOVING LIGHTS MOVING OVER SYDNEY, CANADA.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-30 20:30:00;20 minutes;SEEN STRANGE MOVING LIGHTS MOVING OVER SYDNEY, CANADA. WHILE LEAVING SYDNEY, NS, AIRPORT, I NOTICED 3 LOW LIGHTS OVER TREE LINE ALL FLASHING AT OFFSET TIMES AND A FAIR DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER.  I THOUGHT IT WAS LIGHTS FROM A TOWER, BUT REALIZED THEY WERE MOVING SLOWLY, BUT IN UNISON ACROSS THE SKY.   THEY WERE VISIBLE JUST ABOUT THE ENTIRE DRIVE TO HOWIE CENTER.  THEY WERE WHITE WITH NO OTHER COLOR, BUT FUNNY HOW THEY WERE FLASHING AND ALWAYS THE SAME DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER.
