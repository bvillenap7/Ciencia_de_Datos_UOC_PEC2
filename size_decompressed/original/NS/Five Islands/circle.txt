Object disguises itself as a star;2008-08-16 00:00:00;about an hour;Object disguises itself as a star This object appeared to be circular, near the moon and just as bright. At about 12:30 am, on August 16th, it was a very foggy night, myself and my boyfriend witnessed this object moving very sporadically in and out of the fog, the fog would cover over the object making it much dimmer, after which the object would swerve very quickly back and forth in what seemed to us as a 2-3 ft area and emerge at the bottom of the fog and brightened. At one moment in time an airplane flew overhead the object did not move, almost as if it were disguising itself as star. After watching this object for about an hour, I went to get binoculars, when I turned back the object was gone.;45.3684;-64.0343
