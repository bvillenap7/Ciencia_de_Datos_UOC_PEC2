I felt compeled to look directly up and noticed a kids round mylar(bluish)balloon drifting by at about 15 mph @ 150' and rising while it was heading to the head of the bay.While I was watching the ballon I noticed directly the right of the ballon a most peculiar shape that seemed to defy description.It was pacing the balloon as it went along about 40' -50' away from it.It appeared to be 30'- 40'circular.....damn hard to describe.I'll have to use an analogy.Take a frisbee, construct it out of cellaphane. Remove the top centre flat portion leaving just the edge.This transparent circular thing was becoming more visable in someplaces and hardly visable in others about it's circumference.It was kind of like the edge was rolling up and then unrolling as it paced the kids balloon.As the balloon slowly stalled and just floated higher the circular phenomenon's visability just tapered off to nothing.It was truly spooky,I would have photographed it had I the chance. P.S. when I first noticed the kids ballon I was wishing that the poor souls and victims of the hijackings in the U.S. could find some solace.
