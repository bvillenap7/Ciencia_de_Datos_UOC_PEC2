Large bright light slowly flying/hovering over New Waterford/Lingan;2008-05-08 03:58:00;5 minutes;Large bright light slowly flying/hovering over New Waterford/Lingan I went for a walk about an hour ago, and while walking by my old high school I saw this very bright white light quite high in the sky, above the local skating rink. It moved overhead very slowly at first, didnt make a sound and then it stopped. Hovered in one spot for a few seconds, darted to the left very quickly and stopped again. It started to move left slowly and it hovered again for a few seconds over the neighbouring town Lingan, as far as I can tell. The light got dimmer and I couldnt see it any longer. I cant say I've ever seen a plane that could move like that. Maybe a satellite? I dont know much about them, but i doubt it. If anyone else saw this, please post.;46.2553;-60.079
