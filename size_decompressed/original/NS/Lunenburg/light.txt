High speed zig zagging point of light.;2003-07-23 23:10:00;3 minutes;High speed zig zagging point of light. The weather report was calling for risk of thundershowers however the sky was unusually clear. The temperature was 17 degrees Celsius and humidity 100%. I was outside looking directly overhead and noticed a small white light (like a small star) darting and turning in tight angular patterns at extremely high speed. I watched the light move erratically in this way for about three minutes. Occasionally the light would suddenly disappear and then reappear a little further north. Eventually it just disappeared from view. Shortly afterwards I saw a jet lower in the horizon towards the west tracking a slow straight line south, and then the clouds began to blow in covering the sky within a couple minutes.;44.341;-64.2938
