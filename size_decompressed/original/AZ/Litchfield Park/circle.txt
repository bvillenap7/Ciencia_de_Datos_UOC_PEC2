4 orange orbs hovering over Litchfield Park, AZ;2011-03-18 19:40:00;3 Minutes;4 orange orbs hovering over Litchfield Park, AZ First there were three orange round shaped objects parallel to each other.  They started moving further south, then one disappeared, a couple seconds after the other two disappeared, as soon as that happened the fourth one appeared same color but cigar shaped, it seemed to be coming down while doing so it was moving left to right like a grandfather clock.  As I got closer the fourth object disappeared. While we drove closer we saw other witnesses that were stopped on the side of the road, we also stopped, and a man stopped to talk to us and confirmed the sighting that we had just seen, he talked to us about what he saw, and he said that when he first saw it he witnessed 7 fireballs coming down at rapid speed from the sky, and they suddenly stopped and merged together into one then he stated that they disbursed and formed a single line hovering in the sky.   He also advised us that he has been studying planes for the past 17 years and that his father was in the air force and he had never seen anything like that. He guaranteed those were not regular planes.;33.5103;-112.409
