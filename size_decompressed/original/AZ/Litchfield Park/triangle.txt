AIR FORCE FIGHTER JETS CHASED UPSIDE TRIANGLE SHAPED CRAFT OVER ARIZONA SKIES;1998-01-14 21:00:00;APPROX 15 MIN;AIR FORCE FIGHTER JETS CHASED UPSIDE TRIANGLE SHAPED CRAFT OVER ARIZONA SKIES I WAS DRIVING WEST BOUND ON CAMELBACK ROAD, BEHIND LUKE AIR FORCE BASE ENR TO MY NIECE'S HOUSE IN WADDELL, WHICH IS 20 MILES WEST OF PHOENIX. MY THEN FOUR YEAR OLD SON WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME. WHILE DRIVING DIRECTLY BEHIND LUKE AIR FORCE BASE, SIX FIGHTER JETS TOOK OFF RIGHT OVER MY CAR. INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS NIGHT MANEUVERS, WHICH WAS UNDERSTANDABLE DUE TO TENSIONS IN THE PERSIAN GULF AT THAT TIME. BUT THEN I WONDERED ABOUT HOW SAFE IT WAS TO TAKE OFF SO CLOSE BEHIND EACH OTHER, AND I SAID TO MY CHILD THAT THOSE BOYS LOOK LIKE THEY'RE REALLY GOING OUT TO FIGHT. THEN MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO THE SOUTHWESTERN SKY, WHERE I SAW IT. IT WAS A HUGE, UPSIDE DOWN TRIANGLE, WHICH WAS LIKE SMOKED GLASS, WITH BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS ON EACH POINT OF THE TRIANGLE. REALLY WEIRD STUFF WAS GOING ON AS I WATCHED THE PLANES FLYING DIRECTLY TOWARDS IT. THEN SUDDENLY, IT WAS GONE, JUST LIKE TURNING OFF A LIGHT SWITCH. I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT EXPERIENCE, AND HOPE NEVER TO SEE ANOTHER THING LIKE IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.;33.5103;-112.409
to dark to see color.;2004-04-20 08:45:00;8:45-8:47;to dark to see color. I'm 12 years old, i was 11 when i saw it. 8it started when my dad and i were driving back from somewhere, i can't remember, and i saw this triangle shaped flying object fflying above a bunch of houses behind the wall from the street. it was about 5-8 feet long, and 4 feet wide. and had a light on each pointed end. it was flying right above the houses, about 3 feet above them, and soon flew high into the air above the truck. it happened close to luke air force base, so it could have been a fighter jet, but why would it be about 3 feet above the houses?;33.5103;-112.409
Strange craft with blinking lights in a solid dark black triangular formation spotted over golf course in Litchfield Park, Arizona.;2005-08-19 20:30:00;3 minutes;Strange craft with blinking lights in a solid dark black triangular formation spotted over golf course in Litchfield Park, Arizona. There appeared a triangular craft- a solid dark triangle with a light at the tip and several red and white flashing/blinking lights on the bottom close together.  One light seemed to be apart at a distance from the group of lights. It changed light formation several time.   It was flying very low and slowly over the golf course and I could see it as I approaced my home over the neighbor's yard.  I live on a golf course.   When I arrived in my driveway, I quickly ran to the back of my house/golf course to see up close what and where it was and it was gone in seconds.  Also gone was a large cloud in the sky.  The two disappeared around the same time. The cloud after the craft.  From initial sighting to disappearance was no more than 3 minutes at approximately 8:30 p.m.   My daughter was with me in the car however she is only four and I don't know if she saw what I did.   Craft approximately 50-75 feet (wide) x 100 -150 ft.(Length). Unually quiet evening with some clouds and lightening in the distance.  There wasn't any noise and it was gone as soon as I parked my car in the driveway and ran to the back to see it up close almost as if it knew it had been spotted.  The object appeared to be moving in a southeast direction.;33.5103;-112.409
