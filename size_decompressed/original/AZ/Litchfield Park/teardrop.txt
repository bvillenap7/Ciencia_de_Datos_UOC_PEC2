Large, teardrop shaped, white light emitting, stationary. ((NUFORC Note:  Confirmed high-altitude research balloon.  PD));2009-05-18 19:20:00;Over 20 minutes;Large, teardrop shaped, white light emitting, stationary Approximately 7:25 PM, I was in our north-facing front yard watering newly planted shrubs when a large white light in the northwest sky caught my eye.  It was located on the edge of some high, flat clouds. Too large and round for a jet, was stationary, and very  illuminated with pure white light. About five minutes into my observation, called my husband and daughter out to look, and by then the cloud cover had moved away from the object which appeared to remain stationary. We viewed object with binoculars:  It was teardrop shaped with a bright light on the western most edge (in the middle). At some points it seemed there were two lights (one on the west edge and one on the right). And at one point in the observation it seemed as if a thin line protruded down from the narrow end of the object. I asked a neighbor to view the object with our binoculars and he was impressed with the amount of illumination given off by the object.  Took photo with our digital camera... Returned inside about 7:47 to write this report.  It is now 8:00PM and the object is no longer visible in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Confirmed high-altitude research balloon.  PD));33.5103;-112.409
