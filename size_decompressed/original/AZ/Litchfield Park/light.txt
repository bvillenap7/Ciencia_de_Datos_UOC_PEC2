The sighting lasted about 30 min. other flashing lights were noticed around the main light, not real close but close enough for me to notice.

There was no sound associated and the sky was clear with no clouds.  Looked like a planes headlight but the aura was perfectly round and the aura looked like a smoky bubble.  The white light disappeared but the bubble was lit in white light for another 2 minutes. Then a blue light appeared in the aura and remained for another ten minutes, fading gradually. The blue light resembled a comets tail headed away from us but there was no movement. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));33.5103;-112.409

Fleet of moving stars.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-17 20:00:00;1 hour;Fleet of moving stars Looked like moving stars. First spotted one and then many followed over the hour. Most of them appeared in the west, between Orion and Venus, and headed north where they seemed to rise up higher and higher until they disappeared.  A few of them moved further to the east and one that hovered for about 4 or 5 minutes made a huge semi circle from west to north to southeast before it disappeared. Several just appeared and rose up briefly till they disappeared. One that was particular brighter seemed to slowly pulsate as it flew.;33.5103;-112.409
Star-like UFO and strange sound.;2020-05-17 21:00:00;3 minutes;Star-like UFO and strange sound had just seen the ISS in the sky after my startracker app alerted me. about a minute after it disappeared, what appeared to look like a bright star could be seen at 90 degrees, directly overhead, heading east from the west. i immediately referred to the tracker and could not identify the object as a satellite or anything.  i began filming with my phone, even though it wasn't visible on the screen, i thought maybe it would show if i lightened the video later. this is how i managed to capture this crazy sound, it sounded like a  frequency being tuned, or a microphone feeding back. it seemed omnipresent, got louder for about 10 seconds and then quickly faded away.  about 15 seconds later the object disappeared.;33.5103;-112.409
