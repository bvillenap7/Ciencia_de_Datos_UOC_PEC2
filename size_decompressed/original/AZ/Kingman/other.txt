The object began to appear between the constellations Bootes and Coma Berenices.  It suddenly appeared starting out as a tiny dot much like the Mir,  became larger up to the size of what Jupiter would look like, then suddenly began to become smaller and smaller and then disappeared altogether.  It went from North to South.  I thought at first maybe it was the Mir as my wife and I watch the stars at nite and are familiar with occasionally seeing satellites go by.  I have a little science background and to me, it looked as though a satellite had somehow begun to dip back down into our atmosphere, and then went back up into its orbit, however it never blinked, changed color, or looked like anything other than a satellite.  I still do not necessarily believe it was anything other than a satellite, but so out of control?;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
6 LARGE GLOWING PLASMA ENGINES OVER HEAD;2008-11-21 01:00:00;35 SECONDS;6 LARGE GLOWING PLASMA ENGINES OVER HEAD   While driving here from the grand canyon near Kingman AZ I saw a giant craft that had 6 large rectangle panels on the back end that were glowing blue white like plasma, it looked like the Milinum Falcon from star wars, that's what   First I saw sparkle on the bottom of the craft, that caught my eye as it moved over my car.  Then I saw 2 rows of 3 large rectangles of blue white glowing light. Each rectangle could have been house size.  They appeared to be at the rear of the craft as it moved away from me.  This reminded me of the Star Wars movie and the engines of The Millennium Falcon. It was amazing how big this looked to me, I said out loud to my self, I hope its one of ours. I had just come from the Grand Canyon and was driving almost due West on I40 toward Kingman AZ.  I had just passed US93 when I saw the electrical sparks through my windshield to my right.  It was flying along very slow for a jet and it had a ball of light traveling below it near the ground at the same rate of speed.  You can see the ball in the first few frames, might be a reflection too. I grabbed my video camera and while driving started taping.  In the beginning I passed a freeway sign, Blake Ranch Rd. Exit 1 mile.  I recorded until just after I pass the exit, the craft was to far away, maybe 3 or 4 miles.  It would have passed over the Kingman Airport or very close. When I played the tape later in Kingman, the time code showed I had traveled that one mile in 32 seconds!  No freaking way, I would have had to be going over 100MPH.  My car is 20 yrs old and was packed full, I was moving to San Diego, I was going up hill, no way could doing even 100 mph in that car.  Was I in a time warp of some kind?   I tested the camera and nothing wrong there.   I posted the video on Youttube, but its just shaky lights due to being hand held.  I also posted this report before but it must have been taken down!

Low flying object sighted outside of Kingman, AZ;2011-08-07 08:30:00;under 1 minute;Low flying object sighted outside of Kingman, AZ While I traveling from Kingman, AZ, to Peach Springs, AZ, along Route 66, Sunday, August 7, 2011, I saw what I first took for a large airplane in the sky just below 3000 feet.  I thought to myself that a plane should not be that low, even if they were landing at the Kingman airport.  I looked again and realized that the object I was seeing was not quite in the shape of a plane and as quick as I naturally blinked the object was gone.   The object was just to the north of Route 66 and about 5 miles to the east of Truxton, AZ.   If I had to guess the exact location this would be the coordinates: 35.550385,-113.523846 (these coordinates are taken from Google.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102

Appearance as a Very Bright Star with the naked eye, BUT...With 8-52x60mm W/52x Zoom Field Glasses, Please see my discription.;2015-07-23 20:20:00;15-20 minutes;Appearance as a Very Bright Star with the naked eye, BUTâ€¦  With 8-52x60mm W/52x Zoom Field Glasses,  Please see my discription. We just finished up doing yard work, & was about to go in the house.  I happened to glance up to notice a passing jet airliner @ 8:20 pm.  The sun had just went down behind the mountains so it was still real bright out yet. Just up higher & further out to the west of the jet looked like a very bright star to the naked eye. (I'm guessing the jet was heading to Los Angeles by its heading.  I'm located 20 miles east of Kingman, Az, on Hwy. 66.)  But it was way too bright outside for ANY stars to show. I told my wife to quick grab my field glasses!  (We both saw the star)  As I looked at the star with my field glasses, and zoomed in on the star, it was very apparent this is no star. This is the hard part... It had no wings, No distinguishable exhaust, just stationary. It glowed as the appearance of the night time moon, but its still very light out, so I guess it was reflecting the sun light.  The weird part is, when I zoomed in and focused in on it, it appeared like two 1/2 moons one in front of the other, in other words, picture a 1/2 moon, but then another 1/2 but smaller moon in front of the larger 1/2. Now these were not moons, I have no idea what I was observing just sitting there up in the air not moving. I wonder if the jet that was heading West/Southwest saw it?  Or anybody else for that matter. This object does not appear to fit any known UFO sightings I ever heard of??  Any ideas out there?  This was not a balloon of any type either. Very Strange.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
Huge low flying craft over Kingman, AZ, possible crash landing.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris?  PD));2016-07-27 21:30:00;60 seconds;huge low flying craft over Kingman AZ possible crash landing While sitting out on a clear night to see the stars, we spotted a bright light where we often see an unexplained light. But this was very different.  It had a lit tail behind it, and instead of hovering still, it was traveling fast from West to East, at a downward slant.  We thought it was a plane in distress, however it was silent.  We jumped up to get a better view, and became aware that the light was only the front end of something much much larger. There was a front white light which cast a lit tail behind it, a center lit up by fog or smoke and with red glowing material like red hot coals or hot metal, and finally a back greenish light.  The object moved extremely fast from one end of the valley to the other within 60 seconds, and based on trajectory, would have touched down somewhere between Kingman and Valle Vista.  We heard NO noises.  Wild guess at the size, HUGE at least 1 football field in length.  Shape could have been cigar or saucer...long and linear.   We continued to watch as a bunch of airplanes started to circulate along the trajectory and probable crash site. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris? Probably the re-entry of a Chinese booster.
