Light  over the Arizona Mohave Desert , Hoover Dam.;2000-07-07 21:30:00;10 mins;((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Vandenberg AFB at this time and date.  PD)) Light  over the Arizona Mohave Desert , Hoover Dam. My husband and I were driving to Las Vegas, and at appx. 9:30 pm Arizona Time, we saw a light in the sky over the open desert, the sky was clear with a small moon, the was not a lot of cloud cover, there was not any city lights reflection, however there was a very bright light in the sky. The light was steady, or hovering. It was not moving at all, the light had a point where it looked almost like a light bulb with a light trail that shaped into a a tringle shape, as the light faded there was a blue spot, streak or residue left hang in the sky. This was a very clear mark that remained for almost 45 mins, the color was a very vivid blue and stood out very well aganst the black night sky. I do not know what it was but I am not the only one who was asking questions about it when My husband and I stopped at the Hoover Dam,  a couple in there mid 50's asked us (without any comment form us) if we had seen anything in the sky a while ago. I have tried to find a reason other then the U. F. O.  thing  but have not been able to get anywhere with it it was turly an unaccountable event. This is a full account of the events that had occured, I would like to hear if anyone has any other story re this area or event.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102

11-12-07  three bright  lights slowly blinking  above the ground at  80 feet  within  1/8 mile,  no sound , farm road , disappeared;2007-11-12 18:00:00;5 minutes;11-12-07  three bright  lights slowly blinking  above the ground at  80 feet  within  1/8 mile,  no sound , farm road , disappeared While driving north on Blake Ranch road at about 6pm on November 12th  2007 I  saw what I thought were  new  lights  (stadium like ) placed high up on the side of the road  directly in front of me .This is  a farm road  with limited use for  rural neighbors.  As I approached   I noticed these three bright lights were stationary and slowly blinking all at the same pace. I called my sister who lives close and asked if she could see them. I had her on the phone as I drove closer. These lights were close, big, bright and less than  eighty feet above the ground .I would say the three lights  were about  15 to 20 feet apart . I had the window down to listen for an engine or some sound. As I stopped the truck and got out they were gone. Nothing moved off, no lights in the distance. Nothing . No airplane no helicopter. Nothing.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
Three small green lights moving across Kingman, AZ.;2008-10-31 19:30:00;about 20 minutes;Three small green lights moving across Kingman, AZ. On Halloween night, my wife and I ran out of candy early.  She decided to jump in the shower. I went out front to see if anyone else was coming to our house. I looked up in the sky, as I always do I am an amateur astronomer.  I was looking towards SWS at Jupiter.  That's when I noticed a green solid light, about the size and brightness of Jupiter.  I noticed it was moving towards ENE. I watched it for about a minute, then ran in the house to tell my wife.  Unfortunately, she was in the shower and could not come out and see it.  I then ran into the backyard and I could still see it, moving in the same direction.  I watched it moving ENE until I could not see it anymore. I then looked around, not expecting to see anything else, when I saw two more green lights, fairly close to each other, moving in the same direction.  I couldn't believe it. I watched them move in the same direction, until I could not see them anymore. I was trying to come up with a reasonable explaination for myself.  There were no other lights, like a red one, or a strobe, like on a small airplane, which fly aroung the area frequently.  Since it was Halloween, I had a strong feeling that maybe a kid tied one of those green glowing light sticks to a helium ballon, and it was just floating in the wind, since there was absolutely no sound coming from the objects. I later checked the NOAA website (weather.gov) to check the wind direction that night.  They reported at about 7pm and 8pm.  At 7pm they reported calm wind, no direction.  At 8pm they reported a south wind at about 7 mph.  I do not know what I saw, but they were not going in the direction of the wind.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102

Bright ball of light getting sucked up into vortex outside of Kingman, AZ.;2014-04-08 22:30:00;7 seconds;Bright ball of light getting sucked up into vortex outside of Kingman, AZ. We were driving north along 93 from kingmam, headed toward vegas. I think we were in the vicinity of several forest preserves.  There was limited light pollution, we could see the moon and several hundred stars clearly.  I believe the moon was a quarter moon, but youll have to verify the date.   The moon was on the left side of the vehicle.  Up in the sky, in front of the vehicle, but over toward the left some (colorado river side) we observed an extremely bright ball of light that was brighter than the moon, and about the same approximate size.  It appeared out of nowhere. In an instant, the ball of light dropped vertically downward at super speed, then was sucked up into what appeared to be clouds.  The clouds were parted in the area the ball of light entered, the clouds surrounding the immediate vicinity of the light were illuminated, there appeared to be no cloud movement.  The ball of light dimmed to where it could no longer be seen. I cant say how far the ball of light vertically dropped, but if you hold a ruler to the sky, it was probably about 5 inches.  The drop lasted 2 seconds.  The suck up and fade out lasted another 2 seconds. Definately not a shooting star because:  way too fast, trajectory of drop was straight down and didnt follow curvature of the earth similar to what shooting stars exhibit, was in front/below clouds and was sucked up into them.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102

Relatively slow moving but in total sync with each other.  Disappeared behind some clouds but light could still be seen haloing the rims of the clouds.
