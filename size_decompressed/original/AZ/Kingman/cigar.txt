I spotted 2 red twinkling lights and a much brighter orange light taking up the rear. The 3 lights, at arms length, were approx.1/2-3/4 inch apart evenly spaced,traveling west to east in a straight line,moving very slow. I stopped the car, we watched it for nearly 10 min as it slowly faded out in what now appeared a east northeast direction. as the lights were now at a sight angle and fading fast in the direction of the Grand Canyon..I would guess it was at east 20 -30 miles away.never seen anything like it before;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
