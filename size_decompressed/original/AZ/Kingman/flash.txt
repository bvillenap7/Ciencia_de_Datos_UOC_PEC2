Comet in Kingman?;1990-05-01 20:00:00;5 min;Comet in Kingman? Driving back from New Orleans to San Francisco, we pulled off the Interstate at Kingman and as we did so a comet like craft flew twenty feet or so above us.  It was silent and flashed by so quickly, we couldn't really tell what it was.  The next day driving into California we were in and out of a military convoy that went for miles, with many items on trucks under tarpaulins.  Perhaps it was a test flight...

My girlfriend and I we're sitting on my back patio stargazing in Clacks Canyon.  All of a sudden a spotlight appeared high in sky.;2016-07-12 21:45:00;1 second;My girlfriend and I we're sitting on my back patio stargazing.  I live in Clacks Canyon, Kingman, Arizona.   All of a sudden a spotlight appeared high in the sky and only lasted one second.  This was definitely not an aircraft and was high in the sky like where the stars and satellites were.  We both saw it it was very bright, and we both immediately said what was that.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
07/04/17 @ 04:28 hr Kingman, AZ.  Bright, quick flashing light every 5-15 seconds in constellation Andromeda.;2017-07-04 04:28:00;5 minutes;07/04/17 @ 04:28 hr Kingman, AZ Bright, quick flashing light every 5-15 seconds in constellation Andromeda While taking my pre-dawn morning walk in Kingman, Arizona, I witnessed this incident at 0428 hr PST. My Coordinates at time of sighting: LAT N 35 degrees, 11’ 3” / LONG W 113 degrees, 59’ 53”   While I was walking due north, I witnessed a bright, quick “white” flash high & to the east of me approx. 70 degrees up from the horizon to the left of the star Mirach in the constellation Andromeda.  This flash was the size of the planet Venus which was directly below it. I first thought that it was  tumbling space debris so I fixed my sight there.  Approx. 10 seconds later it flashed again.  It seemed to be in the same location as the last flash so I trained my eye to see if I can locate this objects faint trajectory.  I could not see one.  For the next 5 minutes (approx.) this bright white flash continued at about 10 -20 seconds apart.  The object was moving but it seemed to only move 5-10 degrees in between flashes.  It stayed within the area of Mirach and then finally stopped.   This sighting was unusual in that 2 days later, at the same time of the morning, I witnessed this object again, but this time it was being chased by a faint object that I will file in the next report dated 07/06/17 @ approx. 0430 hrs..;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
