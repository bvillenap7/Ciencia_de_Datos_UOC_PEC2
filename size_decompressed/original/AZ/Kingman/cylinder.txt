Flash of light, sky opened-circular cloud like forms-lights on the horizon around Kingman/Laughlin area through the dam area;2002-03-15 19:00:00;1 hour;Flash of light, sky opened-circular cloud like forms-lights on the horizon around Kingman/Laughlin area through the dam area While driving through Kingman and on the outskirts on our way to Vegas there was a huge break into the sky and a flash of light that looked perfectly star shaped and then turned into a cloud shaped like an oval and then the cloud sucked back into the sky and what was left was a circular spirally shaped irredescent white cloud thing.  We were on the interstate and several cars were slamming on their brakes and swerving, obviously they were seeing what we were seeing.  As the sun continued to set and into the darkness we could see 5-9 lights that looked like they may be planets in a line above the horizon and below the cloud thing that would be in a straight line and then move to a triangular shape and back to a line.  We kept driving for a good hour and could see this phenomenon the whole way to the hoover dam.  It was obviously many miles away on the horizon but it didn't disappear until we got into the mountains around Hoover Dam.....Very strange...Don't know if anyone else has reported it but we would like to know what it was we saw that night!!!! I was with my mother.  Nobody believes us!;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
