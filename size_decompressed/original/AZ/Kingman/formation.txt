5 BRIGHT orange lights flying in a V formation;1997-03-13 20:00:00;6 Minutes;Summary : 5 BRIGHT orange lights flying in a V formation Around 7:30 p.m. my husband first observed 1 light moving across the sky in a SW direction.  No flashing lights just steady.  I saw it also.  30 min later he was looking NW in the Hale-Bopp comet direction and saw a fuzzy light above the horizon.  Too late for the comet so we got a pair of binoculars and WOW.  5 BRIGHT orange lights in a V formation.  Not moving at first and then they were moving very slowly.  We went to get a better view and they were gone!  Where we live they would have been flying over the Lake Mead area .  Possibly Red Lake.   My husband and I are in our 40's.  We own a taxidermy business.  We are interested in astronomy so we are usually looking at the sky.  We know a plane from something wierd.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
String red lights , moving rapdly upw and away turned off, didn't fade away. More notic. than fireworks nearby.;2004-07-04 21:30:00;4 secs;String red lights , moving rapdly upw and away turned off, didn't fade away. More notic. than fireworks nearby. Long string of small red lights, like tailights rapid movement from directly overhead upward and away, as if traser lights from AAA. Witnesses: 2, 39 yr old prof's and 10, 14 yr old children. This happened during the grand finale of fireworks going off 2 miles away. We were on a cliff 200 ft up. The lights were clearly closer to our location (though high in the sky-how high was difficult to tell) than the show. Though the lights were small, they immediately captured everyone's attn at the same time this was interesting in that we were all concentrating on the show in the distance. The lights seemed to simply turn off rather than diminish (again, like traser fire) unlike traser fire it didn't curve back to earth and there was no sound nor logical point of origin (if from a gun).;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
Kingman, AZ, 3/13/19, @ 418AM.

As soon as I walked outside into my backyard, I looked up into the Eastern sky.  I saw 5 very bright lights shaped like orbs in the sky but low in the sky below the clouds.  They were moving southwest.  They were in Chevron formation at first.  Then right in front of my eyes the pattern broke.  They began flying in their own pattern and flying around each other, in a very unnatural manner, as if they were playing with each other in flight.  They changed course, QUICKLY, and began moving East again then changed course again and began moving southwest.  They flew into a cloud and I could still see them illuminating in the clouds and then they just disappeared, right in front of my eyes.  This lasted about 40 seconds.  Amazing.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
see above statement.;2021-05-05 09:15:00;5 minutes;see above statement. We witnessed between 50-75 or possibly more lights in a straight line from as far southwest as we could see to the farthest northeast we could see, moving fairly quickly. No sound or flashing lights. Lasted about five minutes. Called the police dept. and asked if anyone else called in and was told yes.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
