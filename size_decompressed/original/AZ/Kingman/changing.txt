S;2001-08-21 21:15:00;20-30 sec;While traveling southeast on US 93 from Kingman to Whickenburg, AZ one bright lite appeared approx. 45 to 50 deg. above the horizon.  Suddenly the one light split into two with the second appearing east of the first.  A third and forth light then appeared, also to the east as the first two lights went out. With my 25 year background in aviation as a pilot, I am sure this was not an aircraft, no dark shadow or outline of other craft could be seen at the time. The sky was dark but clear with various stars visable.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
30 lights heading toward Vegas over the Kingman area.;2011-08-04 21:00:00;15 minutes;30 lights heading toward Vegas over the Kingman area. There were about 30 of them.  About 15 or 16 were in a group at one time, about 5 minutes later 10 appeared.  Ten minutes later 4 ot 5 followed.  They all seemed to land.  They looked like rectangles and transformed into squares. They had white lights that came from the bottom of the figure.  They were about 3.5 times the size of stars.  The background was a clear sky no clouds and few stars.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
