Please see article.  PD)) ((BEGIN ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ABOUT LAUNCH)) Air Force Test Missile Out West Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly, said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early, Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is, Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability. ((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS));35.1879999999999;-113.83102
Recurring quick, bright flashing object from 07/04/17 being pursued by another object in Kingman, AZ;2017-07-06 04:30:00;8-10 minutes;Reoccuring quick, bright flashing object from 07/04/17 being pursued by another object in Kingman, AZ. While taking my pre-dawn morning walk I witnessed this incident at 04:30 hr PST. Foothills of the Hualapai Mountains east of Kingman AZ.  Very dark and clear. In the same location as my reported sighting on the morning of 07/04/17, I spotted the same bright white randomly flashing object at approx. 65 degrees up from the western horizon, just above, and in between, the stars, Altair and Vega.  This object again just like 48 hours before flashed bright white quickly every 10-20 seconds.   This object seemed to be moving slightly between flashes. I then spotted a faint object like a dim star chasing after the flash.  As soon as the flashing object appeared the other faint object would change its course to pursue it.  The pursuing object was visible throughout the sighting.  The flashing object seemed to be toying with the chasing pursuer changing locations slightly as the pursuing object abruptly changed it course to catch up to it.  This continued on for approx. 10 minutes in the space of approx. a 5 inch circumference  at arm's length until they both faded/stopped as the sun was rising.  There was no sound from either object.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
