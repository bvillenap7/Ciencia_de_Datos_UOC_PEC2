Kingman disc.  ((NUFORC Note:  Regarding alleged crash of UFO on May 20, 1953.  PD));2010-04-15 11:00:00;3-4 minutes;Kingman disc   This event occurred on April 15, 2010, in the rear of the KOA Park in Kingman Arizona.  I was waiting outside for my wife to retrieve a camera for a photo for use as a contributor in a book being written by Brad Steiger.  We had recently retired, and were in Kingman to pick up a 5th wheel RV. Upon looking up at a cloud less sky, I could see a silver disc ascending away from me at a slow pace. By the time my wife arrived with the camera it was almost imperceptible. There was no sound or emissions from the craft. This was five days before the BP Gulf oil blow out. I was missing 3-4 minutes of time. In July, this abduction was the subject of a regression conducted by a hypnotist in Kennewick, WA. This is one of many abductions that have occurred since my childhood. These entities (star people) are red/brown. They expressed serious anger over that blowout which was already underway. On January 12th 2011 while on a trip to Parker, AZ., from where we are currently staying, I found myself missing 30-35 minutes on a 15 mile trip. This will be the subject of a future regression.  Due to the substantial amount of missing time, I fear for the worst. Additional information is available at my blog:  http://destroyedbyoil.blogspot.com/ ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))   Sorry, I had no idea what to do.  I am sure it is the sight.  I will attach the photos.  I brought back some of the battery parts and light bars to the house.  I found this spot about 2 years ago but no one I spoke to was interested.  If you are I will be happy to help you with location and everything.  I believe it was Stancil that drew the picture I will include first.  The 2nd one is a photo of the rocks closer up.  If you are in the area you will see it as Stancil did.  Photos 2,3 and 4 are of the battery parts left laying there over the years.  The 5th one is the light bars that that are talked about by Stancil and everyone else at the site.  Be more than happy to go get more pictures if you are interested.  The sight is only a few miles from Kingman, AZ.  If there is anything else you want from me please let me know.  I think it is important for people that are interested to know that this really did take place.  Later, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2))   It is not of alien origin.  It is what was left after the military left.  They did not clean up well.  The picture that Stancil drew and the area North of Kingman.  The batteries and light bars that have been there for at least 50 years to decompose and rust as they have.  I KNOW what it is and I guess that is all that is important.  I'm not looking for any recognition or anything.  I only thought someone would like to know.  Thank you for your time. ((END ADDENDUM #2));35.1879999999999;-113.83102
Orange lights hover over Kingman Fairgrounds;2011-08-20 22:27:00;4 Mins;Orange lights hover over Kingman Fairgrounds While driving next to the Kingman Fairgrounds we notices 3 orange lights hovering.  We stopped the vehicle and looked for moment and they seemed to be floating/hovering about 25 feet above the ground, so we got out to get a closer look and the closer we got to the fence the further away they would float.   After the last person got out of the vehicle they started to move rapidly toward the 40 fwy and the one in the middle glided to where the left one was and the one on the left glided to where the middle one was, then they did that two more time until the middle one was on the left.  They kept moving further away until they dimmed out.   I dont know what it was but it was quit amazing to see it.  It looked like 3 glowing chinese lantterns in the sky, but there was NO sound and there was no smoke form a candle.  My camera will be with me at all times from now on.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
