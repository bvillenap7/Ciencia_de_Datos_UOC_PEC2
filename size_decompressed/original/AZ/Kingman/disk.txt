Dust devil caused by two UFO's.;2000-11-21 13:54:00;8 minutes;Dust devil caused by two UFO's. Travelling freeway westbound from Arizona toward California.  Saw 1,000+ foot dust devil in the distance off to the left, and took the next off ramp to chase it.  My daughter.  Stopped at railroad tracks bordering a large field, and watch the dust devil dancing around in a backyard, roughly 500 feet away.  Looked straight up and saw a highly reflective saucer-disk shape hovering perhaps 5,000 feet or higher above us.  After a few minutes another identical shape slowly approached and stopped within 50 feet or so from its companion.  Small shifts back and forth now and again, but mostly still.  After 8 minutes they both disappeared, and along with them the dust devil.;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
Kingman Gold saucer Sighting;2003-10-05 21:15:00;20 minutes;Kingman Gold saucer Sighting I was outside October 5th 2003, about 9:14 pm. I was having a smoke, talking to my bestfriend about my day. I looked off into the distance behind my house. It was North of Kingman, and I was amazed shocked off my rocker at what I saw. I froze in one spot and I don't remember if I said a word for a while. All of a sudden it hit me and I was like O my God there is a huge saucer floating over my neighbors house. I mean this thing was HUGE and had Gold flashing lights. All it reminded me of was gold and dimonds. It was so bright and so glamour like. It was kinda rotating back in forth in small motions. I started to yell into the phone. I told my friend to 3-way my Mother and get her outside. While she wasn't answering the phone. I looked back up. Just in time to see the saucer take off. I ran over to my Mom's house and told her to get her butt outside. She said she was so jealous, because I always catch this kinda stuff. I told her to hang around and see what happens. About 2 mins later about 40 planes filled the sky. They all met over the Cerbat mountians and then seperated. My Mom was like whats going on? Yes we do live by an airport, but I promise you I have never seen more then 5 planes in the sky on any given night. I watch the sky every night for atleast an hour to 5. After the planes left a huge bolt of green light flew out of the sky and landed in the little mountians by my house. At this time my Dad came running out. Then all of a sudden here comes 40 planes again. Then another huge Gold glowing light was hanging over by the Kingman Airport. We looked at it in the telescope and it looked like 2 gold cat eyes. My Parents and I were both blown away! Then here comes all these planes again. Within 5 mintues all the planes were gone. The intense vibe was gone and it was like everything was returned to normal. For the record. I do not take any meds, drugs, and I was not drunk. This was very real and very freaky! Thought I would share my experience!;35.1879999999999;-113.83102
