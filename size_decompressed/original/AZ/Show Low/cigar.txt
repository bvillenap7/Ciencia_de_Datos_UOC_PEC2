Gold colored cigar/cylinder shaped object traveling west to east in the sky at 1911 hours on 05/05/02 in Show LOw, Az;2002-05-05 19:11:00;2 Minutes;Gold colored cigar/cylinder shaped object traveling west to east in the sky at 1911 hours on 05/05/02 in Show LOw, Az At approx. 1911 hrs. on May 5, 2002 I went outside to have a cigarette.  It was a clear evening and the sun was just setting.  I noticed an object in the sky that was moving from WSW to ENE [the street I live on runs east and west and the object was moving at a slight angle to it}  Facing due South on my driveway the object was at an approx. 45 degree angle in the sky, approx. 1 1/2 miles away and I would guess the altitude to be in excess of 20,000 feet.  Extending my hand and trying to measure the object between my thumb and fore finger, it measured approx. 3/4 of an inch in length and approx. 1/8 inch thick.  The color of the object was a shiny gold and the shape was similar to a cigar or cylinder viewed from the side.  No noise was heard, no com trail, and no airplane features were observed [i.e. wings, tail, engines etc.]  I had been watching it about 45 seconds when a neighbor from down the street came walking by with his daughter from the east to the west [Scott is about 50 and Bria 13] We exchanged hellos at which point I pointed the object out to them in the sky.  The three of us looked at the object another 30 seconds or so and made some comments about it and then Scott and his daughter continued their walk home.  I continued to watch the object another 15-25 seconds until it disappeared in the eastern sky.  I am a retired police sergeant with 27 years on the job and have seen a lot of strange things in my career, but none like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies self as former public employee.
