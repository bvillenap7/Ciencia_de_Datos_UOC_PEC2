He mentally told me its ok were just passing through;1988-07-01 01:00:00;1 min;He mentally told me its ok were just passing through   I know I’m years late in writing my story, oh I’ve wanted to write and tell someone but who? Who would I tell and what would they think?  That I’m weird or for the most part why? Why would I want to tell, After finally seeing the Peter Jennings report on  UFO’s I decided that maybe I should say something. I’ve read so many other stories on UFO’s and Alien sightings, but I have never read anything even similar to what I have seen. In the summer of 1988, my then husband and our children set out to a Law Enforcement track meet in Show Low, Az.  My husband was a deputy and was on the track team. After the meet, we rented a room at a local 2 story Motel our room was upstairs and sort of in the middle of the bldg.  The door to the room faced west, as you entered the room the 2 queen sized beds headboards were on the north side of the room and on the south side of the room facing north were the dresser and television. That evening we were all in bed and asleep by midnight, my three children slept on the bed that was closest to the door and my husband and I slept on the bed next to them with	 me being on the west side of the bed. Sometime in those early hours I awoke to see two large size Alien Men walk through the wall coming from the room just south of ours, they walked through the wall, through the dresser and the television and as they approached the feet of our bed, they stopped and looked at me, by this time I was totally paralyzed and terrified,  I could not scream move or alert my husband in anyway, I feared for our lives and especially my children. As these being’s stood there watching me and my family, I could see that both had to be at least 6’5 or taller, they were very muscular but yet very lean no body fat, both were wearing body armor, I noticed their color, one was a bluish gray and the other was a redish gray color.   But these two also had a face like a horse, there mouth and nose came out just like a horse or a dog. As I looked at the one that was redish gray, he looked at me and mentally told me “ its ok were just passing through, after which time I think I passed out. I don’t know if anything happened to us that evening, for what ever reason it took years for me to remember that night, or maybe I blocked it out, I don’t know, but I do know what I seen. I never told my husband or children of the incident, and as I type this I wonder am I doing the right thing. Navajo ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.298897368421;-110.007644736842
This sighting was approx. 100-150 feet away from observer.  Please note second sighting 1.5 month later.;2009-08-25 17:10:00;1 minute;This sighting was approx. 100-150 feet away from observer.  Please note second sighting 1.5 month later. First Encounter:  Approx. late August of 2009. Place:  I was standing in the Cell-One telecommunications complex parking lot talking to an employee/customer who just got off work and was sitting in her car.  This complex is on Hwy 260 in Show Low, AZ, approx. two miles south from Deuce of Clubs. Distance:  Approx. 100 feet away. Time:  Just after 5pm. Appearance:  Object was a glowing, bright white light, approx. one foot in circumference.  Sighting lasted less than one minute. Sound or other emanations:  None. Vector:  Object was moving approx. 60-80 miles an hour in a unchanging Southeast direction coming down over the trees covering the hill on the West side of the complex, across the valley and toward Mt. Baldy area, maintaining approx. 100 foot height. Observations:  When I saw the light, I excitedly tried to point the object out to a woman who was a former customer of mine and had just gotten off work at Cell-One and was sitting in her vehicle.  She would not consent to raising her eyes to look at the object, saying it was probably “just a plane”.   I commented that I have seen plenty of planes and this was much too-close to be mistaken for a plane, and was right over our heads, and that she should look at the object.   She ignored me, and I noticed that she behaved lethargic, almost in a drugged state, and would not get out of the vehicle or look at the object.  The object became difficult to see as it past over the field East of us, and I lost track of it.  The woman’s behavior then appeared normal.  I reported the incident to the publisher of my newspaper, who informed me that these sightings of small lights above or in the trees are quite common in the White Mountains, and are often reported to a couple of the local n! ewspapers that she was affiliated with.  She recommended that I not write of the incident, counseling that I would lose credibility if reported publicly.    Also, there were no planes in the sky until approx. 30 seconds after the sighting.   A small propeller plane was moving in a southerly direction appox. A mile high, and I commented to the woman in the vehicle:  “See, that’s a plane”. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
