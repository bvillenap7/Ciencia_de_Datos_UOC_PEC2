3 lights disguised as a plane;1991-09-17 01:00:00;10 seconds;3 lights disguised as a plane 3 objects that I, at first, assumed was a small plane but it made no noise, sped across a clear and cold night. The 3 objects then contracted their formation until they nearly touched. They then took off, 2 along the horizon {1 north,1 south} while the 3rd{formation leader}went up.I kept them in my field of vision for 2-3 seconds until all I could do was track the leader.3-4 seconds of that and then it lost me. They were white lights that seemed to mimic airplane lights, until I noticed them. I know it sounds funny, but I believe they knew I was watching, so they abandoned their charade, in a flamboyant and blatant display of their technology. Then again, if they were so intelligent,why would they neglect the sonic aspect of their disguise? I would've stopped watching before all the good stuff happened if I'd heard anything. It was a clear and silent night.;34.298897368421;-110.007644736842
Giant disc in Show Low with 7 smaller discs in formation;2007-03-22 01:00:00;5 hrs;Giant disc in Show Low with 7 smaller discs in formation   I never have talked about this!   As i was stopped on a back road near Show Low i noticed a circular shape with brilliant lights mainly RED,WHITE,GREEN,BLUE and ORANGE. I had never in my life seen anything that big floating stationary with that many lights on it.  I took my binoculars and could not believe it,these were high dollar specs!  This was a giant disc slanted at an angle just floating with no noise!  It was approximately a couple of miles away,but my view was not obstructed in any way.  As i watched through my binoculars i noticed a red light coming in from the west flying east and just thought it was a small plane headed to Show Low airport since that was the direction it was heading.  To my amazement when this object was directly above me (approx 500 ft) there was no noise!  As it went by it took a direct turn towards this giant disc i had first seen.  I watched in amazement as it flew directly underneath this giant disc and dropped down into the canyon.  I then jumped in my truck and followed. I would guess it probably took 4 or 5 different roads to spot anything again but when i did the unbeleivable happened!   Now the next (discs) that i saw were alot smaller and there was 7 of them that seemed to be searching in a canyon ahead of me. My binoculars were right on these objects and i know what i saw truthfully!  I also flashed my lights at these objects and later noticed i lost 4 hrs that i could not remember what happened.  The next thing i remember is that the sun was rising and the discs were in formation rising above the canyon in a perfect formation!  This is something i witnessed with great binoculars, clear as day.  I still wonder if someone else had witnessed this object.;34.298897368421;-110.007644736842
