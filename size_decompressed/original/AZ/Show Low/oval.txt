Bright lights and no sound;1996-06-15 01:30:00;5-10 minutes;Bright lights and no sound I was coming home from work late and in a rather rual area of Show Low noticed a object coming toward the town.  At first I thought that it was a plane, but it came closer and the lights weren't right for a plane. Then I thought it was a helicopter, because of the bright light, but I thought to myself, why would a helicopter be flying in the middle of the night over open forest land.  I then noticed the light got brighter and there wasn't any sound. When my flight or fight response kicked in it was really bright and I drove as fast as I could home and ran into the house as fast as I could.
