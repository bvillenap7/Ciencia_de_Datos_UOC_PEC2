Object races across the night sky at a high rate of speed;2000-12-18 21:20:00;A few seconds;Object races across the night sky at a high rate of speed I saw one object race across the night sky at a very high rate of speed.  It was a very bright light to low and to fast to be a airplane.  It couldn't have been a meteorite, because it went across the sky horizonally.;34.298897368421;-110.007644736842
Brightly lit object moves erraticly through Eastern Arizona sky.;2012-06-27 23:00:00;30 minutes;Brightly lit object moves erraticly through Eastern Arizona sky. Myself a skeptic and my 12 year old daughter, an even greater skeptic were.looking at Polaris when we both noticed what looked like a star between Polaris and Draco.  It was obviously not a star though because it was moving very rapidly in circles and zig zag patterns.  Some times the object would move in a clockwise manner and then in a counter clockwise direction. Some times it would stop moving in a circle and it would star zig zagging very erratically.  I asked my daughter if I was seeing things and she said &quotno, I see it also&quot. Then I thought may be I am freaking her out so I asked her to tell me which.way it would move and she described its movements to me exactly.  I am still very confused and puzzled by the whole event. I wonder if it was space junk reflecting sun light back at me or the Hubble or the Space Station but I don't think any of those can move like this thing did. It was fast but didn't move in a linear way as I said it would zig zag. Even when it moved in circles it was erratic.  It would also speed up and slow down and move back and forth.  Could it have been a drone? May be the Government has flight technology that we are not yet aware of.;34.298897368421;-110.007644736842
