Bright round light shooting toward land.;2019-11-26 17:30:00;5 seconds;Bright round light shooting toward land. Driving North in Show Low, AZ.  The brightest round light I have ever seen, suddenly appeared mid sky.  The light stayed in one spot for about 5 seconds then proceeded to shoot toward land at a slight right angle.  The descent took less than a second and it disappeared right before it would have made impact.  No flashing, bursts, or explosions occurred.;34.298897368421;-110.007644736842
