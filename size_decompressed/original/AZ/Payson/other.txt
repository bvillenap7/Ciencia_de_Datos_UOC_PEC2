On the night of June 16, 2007, I  saw two of  the very brightest lights I have ever seen.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter??  PD));2007-06-16 22:00:00;unknown;On the night of June 16, 2007, I was camping in Washington Park north of Payson, Arizona, and saw two of  the very brightest lights I have ever seen in the sky.  They were much larger than any of the other stars in the area.  I took pictures of one these lights with my digital camera.  I am just curious if anyone can explain what it might have been.;34.2198;-111.2878

In the car we headed west on Highway 260.  The star was high in the sky directly in front of the car.  After going about 1/4 mile we stopped for a traffic light, the light or star made a horizontial movement, then a vertical descent and stayed low on the horizon, my thought was it is a helicopter.  We made a right turn on Highway 87, north bound.  I continued to watch the light out the drivers side window.  We both observed what appeared as though the light was moving parallel to us.  After travelling 1/2 mile I asked the driver to pull into a gas station, the movement of the light also stopped.  The driver exited the car and started videoing the object for several minutes, using the wide angle/ telephoto feature back and forth.  During the video the object changes colors from a solid to multicolor and the shape changes while maintaining a hexagon shape.  Reentering the car and again heading north, another 200 yards, I again asked the driver to stop in a parking lot as it seemed, beyond logic, the light again moved as we did.  After watching for short time and taking more videos I asked the driver to drive the car south while I stood in the parking lot and kept it under observation, it appeared to remain stationary.  Again getting back in the car we drove another block and made a right turn toward my home, stopping in the middle of the road to look behind us, the light was no longer visible. Attached are (3) still photos.;34.2198;-111.2878
