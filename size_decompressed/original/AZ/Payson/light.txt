I was camping in woods canyon lake north of payson,Az. I was with three friends of mine, two I worked with and one was a older uncle of the other. I had went to bed early that night and I slept in the blazer, I was wakened by a bright light coming from the woods. At first I thought it was a full moon and I knew that Elk was in the camp grounds from the night before. As I looked around I saw the shadows of the trees every where and at that moment I was falling back to sleep like someone or some thing was pushing me down to go back to sleep. I tried to stop and stay awake but it was no use I fell right back to sleep. in the morning I asked if anyone saw the full moon, nobody did. But it was pitch black that night like every night, and the older gentleman said that he saw the tent light up and he could see the other person in the tent. I asked the person that monitors the camp grounds and he said that there is no full moon for at least two more weeks. I walked out to the woods to see if there was a large light tower but I could not find a thing but trees from where the light was coming. This is the same area that a fire in the sky movie was made from.;34.2198;-111.2878

My wife and I were enroute to Phoenix from Payson, Arizona, south-bound on the Beeline Highway/Rte 87.  On the trip, we both noticed a single non-flashing light.  I pointed out to my wife that the object was not in the correct position for Venus. The light travelled from my left to my right over a 15 minute period.  I looked at the clock when we first noticed the light, and the time was 19:22.  We watched the light until it suddenly disappeared completely.;34.2198;-111.2878
Bright light moving slowly across the sky;2021-04-21 04:30:00;10 minutes;Bright light moving slowly across the sky While I was outside on my back porch having coffee, I noticed a very large bright light in the sky towards the North side of the State. When I first spotted it, it was sitting in the air not moving. I watched it for about a minute and it slowly began moving towards the West and eventually disappeared from my view towards the West. The object also made no sound that I could tell, although it did seem to be very far away, given its brightness.;34.2198;-111.2878
