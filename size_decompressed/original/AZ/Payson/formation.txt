6 objects in formation flying North at very high rate of speed, visible with night vision only;2016-05-11 04:00:00;5 seconds;6 objects in formation flying North at very high rate of speed, visible with night vision only While outside using night vision goggles, I observed 6 faint dots (faint with NVG's, would've been impossible to see with the naked eye) flying North at what had to be an incredibly high speed.  I had already seen a few satellites, and they were traveling at least twice the speed of the satellites, if not faster.  They were in somewhat of an M formation, but not precise or constant enough to be one object.  They were able to cross my entire field of view in approximately 5 seconds..;34.2198;-111.2878
