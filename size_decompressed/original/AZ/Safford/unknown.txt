ominous fog, amber glow and loss of time;1995-09-22 21:00:00;Unknown;ominous fog, amber glow and loss of time We experienced an ominous fog following which we retreated into the cab of our truck.  While in the truck we observed an amber glow ascending from the side of Mt. Graham however, never saw any sort of object.  We investigated and found there was no road or surface from which lights could be projecting.  We experienced electrical disturbances with our vehicle.  Our next recollection is being about half way down the mountain with all of our gear neatly packed.  Neither of us have any recollection of breaking camp or packing our gear.  We continued to experience electrical disturbances with our truck while driving down the mountain.  We did not talk about the experience for over a year following the event.  We still do not know what we encountered on Mt. Graham that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD));32.8273;-109.6266
White solid light making a very loud thumping sound;2010-09-28 21:00:00;5 minutes;White solid light making a very loud thumping sound Heard a loud thunping sound as it was almost loud enough to break the sound barrier, i looked up in the sky and at a low altitude i saw a white solid light traveling at a slow speed heading south towards Mt.Graham, it was not blinking it was solid.  It was a loud thumping sound that was loud enough to get dogs barking all over the Glenn Meadows area.  I watched it for a few minutes until before my eyes it dissapeared, the sound and the light was gone.   I was in the Marines for several years and my job was bulk fuel which consisted of fueling military aircraft like helicopters and f-15 and 16's, i know this was not a aircraft of ours.  Very weird.;32.8273;-109.6266
