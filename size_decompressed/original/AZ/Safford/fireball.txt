fireball just above cloud level approached from eastern horizon and disappeared into western horizon;2004-05-05 19:00:00;6 seconds;fireball just above cloud level approached from eastern horizon and disappeared into western horizon While camping in the desert approx 20 miles east of Safford Az on May 5, 2004, 15 miles down the Hykel road I saw what appeared to be a basketball size fireball approach at just above cloud level from the east. I observed the object approach from the eastern horizon it flew directly over my head and disappeared into the western horizon all within a matter of 6 seconds. The fireball was distinct glowing red yellow and blue with a red tail that appeared to be about 3 feet long. I'm not a UFO nut or anything and have seen thousands of meteors in the desert sky but never anything like this fireball, it was like something out of a sci fi show.;32.8273;-109.6266
Fire ball in sky over Safford Arizona;2007-05-30 21:00:00;5 minutes;Fire ball in sky over Safford Arizona It was shift change and I was relieving the employee before me. I looked to the sky and saw a large fireball like object form in the sky overhead. It split into 4 smaller fireballs which flew around a bit and then reconverged into one and disappeared. My coworker saw it as she stood beside me.As soon as the fireball disappeared it looked like there were many many plane lights blinking on and off around the same area the fireballs had converged to We didn't think there was any possible way that many planes should be in that small an airspace. I'm not sure what this was but it was unlike anything else I have seen.;32.8273;-109.6266
Fireball looking object in south sky 12 miles south of Safford, Arizona.;2012-07-25 21:00:00;10 seconds;Fireball looking object in south sky 12 miles south of Safford, Arizona My child was driving and I was the passenger.  We were 12-13 miles south of Safford, Arizona.  We turned east onto Artesia Rd after traveling south on Hwy 191.   We were traveling east approximately 25-30 mph as Artesia is a dirt road.  There was a half moon with a few clouds in the west sky.  The south sky was clear.  The east sky had rainclouds with lightening, far away, like probably on the Arizona-New Mexico border.   I was looking at the south sky, my window was halfway rolled down.  I said to my child, That's a strange light, and rolled my window down all the way.  I saw what appeared was a fireball and my first thought was a meteor, but the object was not moving.  I noticed that although it reminded me of a fireball there were no &quotflames&quot coming out.  It was kind of low in the sky and seemed close,  and I bet that if it was closer it would have been a very large craft, or object.  I saw it for about 10 seconds and then it was gone! , in the blink of an eye.   I then thought that a cloud was obscuring my view but I could see stars and there were no clouds in the south sky.  No sound , no vapor trail, no blinking lights, nothing coming out of it.     After being home for 15 minutes my husband and I went outside and started looking in all directions, about 9:20 p.m. (21:20).   I saw many commercial airplanes way,way up in the sky.  Then out of nowhere the object appeared in the east sky, farther away, and after about 3-4 seconds it was gone, in the blink of an eye.  My husband was looking south so he did not see it, and since my child was driving my child did not see it.  I know this area is a military MOA and have watched many war games, day and night.  I have seen many types of aircraft flying over, day and night.  I have also seen satellites moving across the sky, and I have seen flairs dropped.  The stars seemed brighter and twinkling more on this night compared to many other nights and the moon was ve! ry bright for being a half moon.;32.8273;-109.6266

Fireball seen over Safford Mine;2021-01-04 06:17:00;1-3 seconds;Fireball seen over Safford Mine I was heading North into the Safford Mine this morning. I had just passed the main gate and looked up to see an incandescent colored fireball streaming at a E-NE heading from the San Juan pit to the Lone Star pit.  The object was roughly 300 feet above the haul road and seemed to follow it directly. I originally mistook it to be a low flying helicopter but the object had no anti-collision lights. My suspicions were confirmed when the object passed in front of the Southern mountain peak (Peak 2) of the Lone Star pit. The object disappeared as it passed in front of the mountain. The object covered the roughly 3 mile distance in less than 3 seconds. It had the beginnings of the curved shield shape forming in front of the object like those typically seen in objects entering the atmosphere. Earlier this morning there was an unusual amount of helicopter traffic in the Gila Valley. I live in the flight path for the local hospital so, I thought there may have been an accident on the highway or at the mine, etc. The local med evac chopper is a small helicopter. The traffic heard this morning sounded more like multiple heuys hovering over my neighborhood. The noise diminished slightly when I went to get in the car. There were no helicopter lights visible in the sky at the time.;32.8273;-109.6266
