Bright orange flashes in the eastern and western Safford skies.;2011-02-15 20:00:00;30 minutes;Bright orange flashes in the eastern and western Safford skies. On February 15th 2011 myself and 4 others witnessed several bright orange lights in the eastern sky first around 630pm then several ,around 20 different flashes of orange lights in the western sky.  The duration lasted 25 to 30 minutes.  They would appear , sometimes 3 at a time and then suddenly dissapear.  They did not look like flares because they would not fade out.  That was my first assumption but i looked for blinking or any other light that may be a airplane and we saw nothing of the sort.  We counted over 20 different flashes of the bright orange lights.;32.8273;-109.6266
