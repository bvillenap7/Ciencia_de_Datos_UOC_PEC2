T shaped red object formation;2008-01-07 06:00:00;15 minutes;T shaped red object formation I was on my way to work heading down 8th ave Northbound around 6am in the morning and looked up to see a T shaped red light formation, non blinking. It seemed to be hovering low because it was a overcast morning and this was for sure below the clouds. It headed north towards the Phelps Dodge Mine then it took a sharp ninety degree turn and headed west towards Pima ,AZ. I watched the object until it was out of sight. This object did seem to move at a very slow speed and was definatlely not a helicopter or plane , very weird!!;32.8273;-109.6266
