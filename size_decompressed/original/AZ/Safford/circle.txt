They just hovered in the sky for approximately 30-40 minutes, changing different colors, then one by one, just disappeared.   When my husband  zoomed in on the objects with his camera, you see the shape as perfectly round.  It was a clear and beautiful night, with a beautiful starry sky.  Those three objects were not stars!  We have a video of one of the objects.   Check it out for yourself!;32.8273;-109.6266

It slowly faded away after being present for about 2min.   For about an hour you could still see a tiny green speck in the sky.  It looked and felt ominous.;32.8273;-109.6266
