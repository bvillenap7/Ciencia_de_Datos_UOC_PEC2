I was looking east toward Dragoon Mts (10 miles) and Chiriacua Mts (20 miles).  Thunder storms were present. A cigar shaped light emerged through the dark clouds, as a bright yellow light, leaning about 30 degrees to left of verticle as a back slant.   As it emerged a triangle shaped appendage arppeared on its left side and it slowly straightened to verticle at which time the triangle melded into the object.  It continued to move to about 30 degrees to rignt of verticle, like a (/).   Then, it began to move toward the south, sometimes quickly and then slowly.  It moved to a point above the Dragoons, then appeared to turn its atttitude toward the horizontal with the tail end pointed toward the west and became, to me, a dot.   It then moved rapidly to the south or southeast toward a major thunder storm south of the Chiracaua Mountain range in the vicinity of Mexico.  It soon disappeared below the horizon.
