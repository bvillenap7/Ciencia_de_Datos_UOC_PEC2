This is interesting because it sounds like what we saw was seen in southwestern CT a few days later â€“ in the daylight (see other posts). We were camping in our rented RV in Organ Pipe National Park, in southern Arizona, about 40 miles from the Mexican Border.  We were sitting outside of the RV.  It was about 8:45 pm.  Suddenly, my wife noticed a bright stationary light in the northern sky, close to the horizon.  I looked quickly and saw it too.  From that one bright light, another bright light came out of it, then another, and another until there were four bright lights, all stationary.   Then, one by one they merged back into the first light until just the original light was left.  The single orb flickered once,  then disappeared.  No noise, and no movement, other than moving in/out of the original orb.;32.2295;-112.6542
