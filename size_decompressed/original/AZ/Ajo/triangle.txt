My wife and I saw a huge triangular shaped object, red lights at each point, for about 5 minutes. ((anonymous report));2017-03-20 23:00:00;5 minutes;My wife and I saw a huge traingular shaped object, red lights at each point for about 5 minutes. My wife and I stepped outside to see what our dogs were barking at and heard a humming/jet engine sound.  (We hear & see jets all the time because we are 10 miles south of BMGR training area.)  This was not a normal jet engine sound.   When we looked straight up, we saw a HUGE triangular shaped something with red lights at each point  of the triangle.  This thing appeared to be as big as a baseball park (not just the diamond, the stands and everything).  It was flying in a totally different direction than the jets we see almost every night training on BMGR.  We never see commercial aircraft down here because of BMGR.  It's pretty much a no-fly zone.   This was the first time my wife and I have ever thought that we definitely saw a UFO (we're in our early 60's).  Stealth bomber?  If it was, it was by far the biggest aircraft we've ever seen.  We watch it until it faded out of sight.
