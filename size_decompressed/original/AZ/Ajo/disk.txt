IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN A SATELLITE, WITH NO SOUND AND NO NAVIGATIONAL LIGTS (I.E. GREEN, RED OR WHITE).  I GRABBED MY PALM CAMCORDER AND GOT IT ON TAPE. THE OBJECT CHANGED ITS COURSE TO SOUTH NEAR THE END OF SIGHTING, AT WHICH TIME ITS GLOW FADED.  ABOUT 15-20 MIN. LATER, I SPOTTED WITH MY BINOCULARS A MILITARY JET (IDed BY THE WHITE BLINKING LIGHT)-  FAR TO THE SOUTH FROM THE NEARBY AF RANGE AND AIR CORRIDOR USED BY THE A-10s GROUND ATTACK PLANES- FLYING ON INTERCEPTION COURSE FROM D-M AFB TOWARD THE AREA WERE THE DISC WAS LAST SEEN HEADING TO.
