Its size was comparible to the moon. I went to get the Binoculars, but when I got back it was gone. The light was 4 or 5 times brighter than the lights from all the other airplanes in view. It didn't seem close, but very large. The light was a bright White color. That's all I was able to see. I personally think it was probably a plane flying even with my eyes, but the extreamly bright light makes me wonder.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Just to the east of the moon, and below it, a light just appeared.  Brighter than any of the stars that were out!  As if it had intelligence, realizing that I saw it, it just SHOT across the sky, in a WSW direction.  I watched, expecting to see it complete it's journey, but almost as soon as it started to speed up to go, it was like it hit a speed that I cannot describe, and just simply DISAPPEARED!!  I was left with a tingling feeling, and an emotional impact that I just did not expect!  I almost cried!  I saw this, I KNOW I did!!!  What an experience!;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

I looked up into the southern sky and noticed a red flashing light ( There was not a rythm or pattern to how it was blinking)in the sky(at about 30 - 35 degrees from the horizon) It was moving slowly towards the east / north. My line of sight of the object was about to be blocked by the corner of the apartment, so I ran out to my other patio (off of the living room) so I could have an unobstructed view. After a couple of minutes, it was still blinking but seemed to have stopped moving and the light would go out for longer dueations ( 1 - 2 second) and just stopped all together. I stood outside for about another 5 minutes to see  if it would come back, the object did not but I did see two planes flying at a high altitude, one coming from the east and the other coming from the north. The plane from the east flew very close to where the object had been, and the plane coming from the north turned west just about where I had seen the object ( about 10 seconds before the west bound plane).;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Our house sits up on a hill so we have a partial view of East Mesa. Red Mountain is blocking our view of central and western portions of Mesa. The previous night at 20:05 (Oct 12) we noticed 9 amber lights hovering in that vacinity (see my post titled Phoenix Lights are Back!).  This evening (Oct 13), 3 of the amber lights returned at 18:40. I just happened to walk out at the right time and looked out in the same direction they were seen the night before and to my surprise they were there. This time I had my camcorder fully charged. I recorded the lights for 90 seconds until they dimmed out one by one. The lights were in a trangular formation....they seemed further away than the previous night. They also appeared to be closer to the ground than the night before. In my video footage (which I'm making available to the UFO Reporting Center for visitors to view) you'll notice a plane that appears to fly under the formation of lights. ((NUFORC Note:  The lights have been seen, and video-taped, on several occasions, beginning on October 4th, and we suspect that they may be flares in the vicinity of Gila Bend Firing Range.

I was sitting outside in my hot tub looking up at the sky.  I live pretty far out, so there is not alot of light pollution and the sky is very clear.  I saw a controlled bright light in the sky.  It appeared to be inside the atmosphere. It traveled across the sky at about the same speed as a shooting star, but it faded to black and kept traveling across the sky. Every night I see multiple shooting stars and airplanes landing at nearby airports, and this was definately not the same type of light.

When I examined the pictures I found a strange light on one area of the first picture I took that was below the Moon in the bottom portion of the picture.  Thinking I may have snapped a picture of a commercial aircraft I took several test pictures to check. I took pictures of one helicopter and two commercial aircraft at different altitudes.  When I compared the pictures I found them to be different.  This is something I am unsure of and  have no area of expertise on.  I would like it if someone else could check this out.

Very bright light drops off smaller light & flies upward & disappears;2008-02-01 07:15:00;15-30 minutes;Very bright light drops off smaller light & flies upward & disappears I was walking to school when a very bright red/orange light above the Superstition Springs Mountains caught my eye. I watched it as I walked. It very very slowly descended directly downward for a long time. I assumed it was something falling from space. Then, when it looked like it was just about to reach the top of the mountain, a smaller light fell or was dropped and took a few minutes to fall onto the mountain and disappear. The light then began to rise in a diagonal straight line heading southward at a noticeably faster speed than before for about five, or at most, 10 minutes. It flashed and disappeared just before crossing paths with a commercial airplane headed West. (It looked nothing like the airplane.) I had seen a similar light in the same area a few days ago, but it had just hovered there. I had thought it was some sort of astronomical body, a star or planet maybe. Any suggestions?

Two bright amber colored lights appeared over Phoenix, Az.;2008-09-02 21:15:00;1+ hour;Two bright amber colored lights appeared over Phoenix, Az About 9:15pm, I went on my patio to look at the stars (which I do regularly), and noticed two very bright amber colored lights in the distance.  I am in far NE Mesa, close to the Tonto National forest.  I am fairly high up on the mountain, and these lights were directly south of my view, possibly over Chandler or Gilbert.   I went back inside to get my husband since I wanted his opinion as to what these were.  We were back out on the patio together within less than 30 seconds.  Within about 20 seconds the light to the right faded out, and immediately after, the left faded out.   After about 1 minute, these lights both appeared again in the same exact spot.  They were not as bright as they had been when we first spotted them.   Over the course of the next hour and a half, these lights continually faded in and out.  Sometimes it took 5 to 10 minutes for the appear again.    We noticed that when the faded back on again, they had moved slightly - sometimes higher, sometimes lower, and sometimes spaced apart a little bit.   We also noticed a very smaller (third) light that would sometimes move around these other larger more stationary lights.   I brought my teenage out the patio to witness this, to see what he thought.  All of us were completely at a loss for what this was.   We called two news stations and reported this.   I wanted to call Luke Airforce Base, but could not find a contact number anywhere on their website.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Some were fainter than others.  As we started to watch them, we would notice they would start moving in circles, up and down, figure eights.  Most times there would be a second star a little over dancing with the other.  When a plane would go by, the object would stop moving almost like it was just pretending to be a star.  After we noticed a couple, we started to look around for more, and indeed did realize not all the stars in the sky were infact stars.   We went inside after about 40 minutes and after seeing about 5 objects circling and hoovering about the night sky.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

My wife is from Japan and loves her outdoor hot tub, she's out there just about every night for the past 5 year, even in the hot summers of Arizona. She has been telling me of these strange lights that get real bright and and then dissapear very fast. I have been an Aircaft Mechanic sinse I joined the Air Force in 1980. Needless to say I have seen just about every man made aircraft ever made. So over the past few years I have explaining to her what a satelite looks like, pointed out the space station, space shuttle, and all manner of aircraft movement. She kept saying yea but this is different. Well, I finally seen it for myself last night and yes this is something completely different. We live on the edge of the metropolis in far East Mesa right next to the GM proving grounds. A bright white light like a low orbit salletite that moved from north to south that suddenly lit up to perhaps 20X brighter & larger. At this point the object shot directly into outer space and extremly high speed. Not speed of light speed but very very fast. No sound and only white light. I know of nothing that can move like that, very bizarre. The whole event lastest less than 10-15 seconds, with my wife sreaming there that is what I have been seeing. Well I have no explanation but it did appear to move like a vechicle of some sort. A UFO until someone could explain what we are seeing.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Initially I thought it was an airplane, but after it remained in the same position for a couple minutes I realized it couldn't be. I looked for airplanes in the sky and one moved beyond this light so I definitely knew it was stationary. I called my parents on the phone and had them head out to look at it. It was after I hung up with them that I noticed a second due north. I went to take video and pictures with my phone, but neither finction worked. I had stopped on the side of the road for a better look when I heard helicopters coming from the south (Williams Air Force base) as they passed overhead the northern light went out. The light in the west northwest remained. I drove home to get my camera which is only 4 miles away. By the time I got home the light was out and I've never seen either since. Nothing was mentioned on the news or in the newspaper after. The skies lighting had the sun set behind mountains but still light outside.

I was star gazing on May 20, 2010 at 1:40 a.m. when two orange/amber lights appeared from the southeast more parallel with an east/west orientation than north/south but at a slight angle, I estimate the angle to be 20 or 30 degrees. I say this because they came into view as I was looking toward the back fence which runs parallel with a street that runs in an East/west direction. One light was in front of the other but not in a straight line like single file, they were slightly offset from one another. They stayed the same distance apart. The speed remained steady. They did not zigzag or bounce around, or waver. I heard no sound from the lights as they passed overhead. I couldn't decipher any definate shape to the objects. The edges . They were diffused or hazy the same way street lights or headlights appear to me, with a kind of halo effect. They seemed to be going slow but in reality they had to be going fast as they disappeared out of sight within seconds. Because we live on the outskirts of the flight path of an international airport and airplanes pass over all the time I'd say they were considerably faster than any airplanes I've seen. It's kind of hard to judge the size of the objects as there was nothing relative to compare the size with, but I'd say they were at least as large as a commercial airplane, maybe larger.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Successive bright amber lights lighting up in a row.;2015-12-15 19:10:00;10 seconds;Successive bright amber lights lighting up in a row As I was driving home from dropping my daughter at Volleyball practice in Gilbert, AZ, while driving east on Germann Rd near Higley Rd, I saw lights, about 2 miles up, directly over Phoenix Mesa Gateway Airport (KIWA.)  The lights successively lit up from right to left with a bright amber points of light.  I believe there were about 6 of them.  After each light lit up and the one next to it lit up, it would go dim and disappear.   After arriving home around 7:15pm, I immediately called the Airport's Aviation Services, fixed base operations, and the lady that answered the phone said that they just heard the tower address the lights and nobody knows what they were or how they ended up directly above runway 12R-30L.  She said it was very strange, but had no explanation.   I am an aviation enthusiast and am very familiar with anomalies in the skies.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Bright red light,waning until disappearing, moving in small, erratic, directional changes.;2016-11-22 21:30:00;20 minutes;Bright red light, waning until disappearing, moving in small, erratic, directional changes, and didn't seem to be acting as an aircraft. While sitting outside our home, we noticed a one very bright red flashing light that appeared to be moving in small increments in different directions.  After approximately 20 minutes, the brightness of the object gradually waned to merely another light, similar to a star in the sky.  Moments later, it literally disappeared.   I am aware of different conditions that can seem odd to the casual observer, such as a jet airplane that may be cruising at high altitude after sunset and the Sun's rays reflecting off the airliner's skin and appearing to be a bright red fast moving object.  I have been around airports and airplanes for most of life and have seen many aerial objects in combat areas, so I know something odd when I see it.  I sincerely believe that I witnessed a UFO above the Mesa/Apache Junction/Queen Creek, Arizona area.  Thank you.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
3 Pulsing yellow/orange lights.  ((anonymous report));2017-02-02 20:00:00;20 seconds;3 Pulsing yellow/orange lights Looking south from McDowell Rd and 202, I saw three pulsing lights hovering in a straight line.  After 20 seconds or so, all three lights disappeared.   This is the second time in 3 months I have seen these.

Blue dot in sky ascends and descends quickly with a plane flying by a reference.;2017-04-02 22:40:00;1 minute;Blue dot in sky ascends and descends quickly with a plane flying by a reference. Looking SE from my 3rd floor apartment patio, saw what I thought at first glance was the police helicopter circling something but when I looked back it had done this super fast circle and immediately dropped behind the tree/building line of sight.  Seconds later it reappeared and achieved a very high altitude in seconds.  I recorded it on my phone and will be sending that footage to you guys as well. In the video, it appears as a blue dot and seems to hover for a bit then starts descending again as a passenger plane approaches. It lowers below the aircraft, hovers for a second, then continues its descent until out of view again. Shortly after a helicopter flew over the area as well as other lights that looked to be small aircraft or helicopters in the distance for about 10 minutes afterwards. I understand this could just be someone playing with a drone or whatever, but the altitude it appears to achieve and the speed it occurs at is something I've honestly never seen before.  Never seen a drone or anything like this flying in this area of Mesa/East Valley in my whole life.  Like I said, could possibly be explained or debunked but I felt strong enough about it to let you guys take a look.  Thank you.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Bright light with trailing aura moving across the sky.;2017-12-22 18:40:00;30 seconds;Bright light with trailing aura moving across the sky My partner and I saw a bright light with a trailing aura (like a wake spreading out behind a boat, only not V-shaped, but more U-shaped) slowly move across the sky. We live near the Phoenix-Sky Harbor flight path, so we see planes coming in a lot.  This looked completely different than the normal planes we see coming in at night.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
A light in the sky that emitted whitish beam with a tint.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch at 5:27 p.m. (Pacific).  PD));2017-12-22 18:52:00;0:30;I was in the middle of wrapping Christmas gifts, when my fiance called.  He is a mailman that's why he was out late.  He let me know to go outside that there is a light in the sky that emitted whitish beam with a tint.   I grabbed my mother in law and said come outside there is something in the sky.   I went in the house to grab my camera and when I came back outside my mother in law let me know that a yellow round light beam shot out for about 2 seconds and then a green light that was round shot out.  From my understanding of air control rockets can emit beams of light due to aircraft's.  They even tell you on new statements not to use lasers or appoint them randomly in the sky rad aircraft's.   I called my brother who lives in Los Angeles he captured the event on video.  This did not look like a rocket to me in the video.  It looked more like a comet like object.  If you look closely at the video you can see there's something in the trail like there's 2 objects.  I've never seen a rocket leave a trail the way that this anomaly did.  The most odd aspect of this event is how the light lit up the cloud like it was forming a cloud.  Not to mention after my brother filmed this video he said that helicopters were following the anomoly.  If this was a rocket what purpose would helicopters have in following a test rocket.

At First was 5 or 6 but would dissipate when you caught a glimpse of them.  The Color was Orange Hazy but each one was like 3 points of light that formed a upside down triangle (flying in formation like ducks );33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Bright light in the sky in Mesa area.;2019-04-10 19:00:00;25 minutes;Bright light in the sky in Mesa area Around 7:00pm we saw this bright light in the sky that looked like a miniature sun.  The light shape and color changed several times.  Also the movements were not consistence with known flying objects.  The sighting lasted about 25 minutes.  The shape got smaller and then looked like a star.  I have videos and pictures that proof what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Aircraft with Four white lights with no red/green running lights;2020-01-30 22:00:00;5 minutes;Aircraft with Four white lights with no red/green running lights On January 30, 2020 around 2200 hours,  I was in the whirlpool at Sun Life RV Park located at University Driver and Higley Road in Mesa AZ. Looking  skyward I noticed a commercial passenger jet (I don’t recall the name of the airline) moving on a heading from the SE to the NW apparently heading for the Sky Harbor airport. I then noticed an aircraft heading from the NE to the SW.  The aircraft passed underneath the passenger jet in very close proximity which I thought was close to a near miss. The second aircraft approached my position and flew directly overhead.  The aircraft did not display any red/green running lights nor any strobe lights.  Neither did I observe any lights which would have appeared in the cockpit area.  The only lights I saw was two vertical bright white lights and the end of what would have been the ends of a fixed winged aircraft. The lights were positioned as follows: O                                                  O  O                                                  O I heard the engine noise of the passenger jet but did not hear any other sounds as the second aircraft passed overhead.  After the aircraft was downrange the configuration of the lights remained the same. In other words the aircraft lights appeared the same coming at me and going away from me. In the darkness I could only see the lights. I could not see an outline of the aircraft. I called Sky Harbor and was transferred to someone possibly in the control tower and explained what I observed.  He said he would review the radar recording.  Subsequent attempts to reach anyone for a follow-up conversation proved fruitless.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
