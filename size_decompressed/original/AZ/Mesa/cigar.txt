I looked up over my shoulder to see how much sun I was getting and saw a huge cigar shaped object sliding through the sky at no more than 200 feet up.  It was very shiny, seemless and big.   It was heading south east at a slow steady rate.  There was no indication of a propulsion system.  It was the same in front as in back.  It confused my senses because it was so huge that it should have been making some kind of noise.  I couldn't even hear it displacing air.   It was in view for no more than 10 seconds maybe less before the apartment complex next to my parents house obscured it.  About 15 to 30 seconds after it left my view a military jet fighter came right behind it low and slow.  The fighter validated my sense perception since it was obviously following the UFO and was loud.  It was very unusual for a fighter to be flying so low and slow over a populated suburban area.  I had never seen a jet fighter do that before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

At sunset, a large cloud approached from the SW to a pos. approx. 10 km from us.  ((NUFORC Note:  We see clouds only.   PD));2008-08-31 20:55:00;90 minutes;Sighting 08/31/08(20 At sunset, a large cloud approached from the southwest to a position approximately 10 kilometers from our location at Usury Park hiking trail.  The sunset illuminated the cloud revealing many strange objects within (or possible one very large single object).  Some shapes appeared to be solid and others appeared transparent.  As the sunrays varied with the sunset so did the shapes of objects within the cloud.    Other clouds surrounding the larger appeared strangely illuminated in bright iridescent colors.  Many other hikers stopped hiking and marveled at the objects within the clouds.   I took many pictures of the event and was in the process of creating a panorama in Adobe CS2.  As the individual photographs were overlay semitransparent on each other to form the panorama, many more objects were then reveled in greater detailed clearly identifying them as possible UFOs.  It now became apparent that the large clouds concealed one very large craft (approx 30 kilometers in diameter and many other smaller craft in the adjacent clouds.  There appeared to be a bright illuminating beam of light cast down to the ground with  another UFO object suspended within it.  I am sending several photographs by e-mail to Mr. Davenport to help document the event.  In addition to your reference number, please use CODE: 00100A00B-000 as a cross reference. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report forwarded photos, but all we see are clouds.  No UFO is apparent to us.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Fast moving glowing object with glowing gas plume remaining for several minutes flew over Phoenix after sundown heading north to south.;2017-12-22 18:55:00;2 minutes;Fast moving glowing object with glowing gas plume remaining for several minutes flew over Phoenix after sundown heading north to south. A glowing orangish cigar or cylindrical shaped object formed  a huge fan of whitish glowing gas (at about a 45 degree angle behind the object) with object traveling horizontally at a high rate of speed from North to South over Phoenix (Observers were looking west from a Mesa Hillside). The residual gas remained behind and stayed glowing for several minutes after object could no longer be seen near the horizon.  The object was not a meteor or an aircraft.  Based on the remaining gas plume the object originally must have traveled west to east first and then turned south somewhere over north Phoenix. It could have been a rocket that went off course? ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch at 5:27 p.m. (Pacific).  We have changed the time indicated by the witness, to reflect an afternoon launch.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
