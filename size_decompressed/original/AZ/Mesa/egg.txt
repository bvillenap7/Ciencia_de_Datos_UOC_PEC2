Black,grey,and white egg shape low to the ground and NO LIGHTS!;2001-02-16 22:17:00;2 minutes;Black,grey,and white egg shape low to the ground and NO LIGHTS! I was driving Eastbound on Guadalupe at 10:17 and I notice something larg in the sky. I thought wow an owl. But thier was no flapping wings and after a long look I was thinking, That is the biggest owl I have ever seen. So started to think it was a larg grey balloon. Like the ones you to advertise with but it was a waired color for that Grey, Black, and white. The white was dirty and bloochy streaks. Going with the balloon I stepped on it. Well I was going 65 MPH and the balloon was accelerating away. Then was just plain gone!!! I fallowed this balloon from Pheasant Dr in Gilbert to 74 St in Mesa this is a distance of 1.5 miles maybe a little less. Thier was a balloon going plus 65 MPH in Southeast Mesa on a Friday night? No. This was no balloon or an owl. It made no noise or smell and had no lights. In thinking about it The only reason that I saw anything was the fact that this thing was flying just above the light polls along the side of the road. It could not have been over 50 feet off the ground. It stayed at that height for the whole encounter till it was gone. I wonder why it was so low. This is really odd because half a mile to the South thier is a line of high tension power lines. The fallowing day their was a flight of three F-18 Hornets that where fly around that part of the valley. They could have came from Luke or Davis-Monthan, I never see those type of aircarft on this side of the valley.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Metallic object flashing in sky.;2016-12-31 17:00:00;20 minutes;Metallic object flashing in sky. I was walking down 8th ave near the railroad tracks in downtown mesa, looked up and saw what i thought to be an approaching plane, but it remained motionless in the sky, slighlty gliding around about sundown, its body glimmering with light from a setting sun.  It appeared to be hovering over interstate 87 on the pima reservation.   I brought a police officer's attention to it who was nearby working an unrelated call, and after he saw it, told me it could be a balloon.  The object vanished in clouds soon after.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
