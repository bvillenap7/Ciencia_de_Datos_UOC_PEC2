3-4 UFO's forming a pyramid formation in a Mesa Arizona Desert.;2004-01-27 19:30:00;10 minutes;3-4 UFO's forming a pyramid formation in a Mesa Arizona Desert. We were driving through a main road by the desert out in Mesa, AZ and we noticed some lights out in the desert, on the desert floor.  So we changed our path from going East and decided to follow the lights and go North.  Then we noticed that one of the lights ascended up in the sky followed by another.  There was still one UFO on the desert ground.  Then the one on the ground followed the other two up in the desert sky.  The 3 (or 4 couldn't really tell) formed a pyramid formation and were each a different color.  One was green, one was yellow and the other was red (or orange couldnt really tell).  Then about 1-2 minutes later they all formed 1 UFO and the colors changed from all those colors to just a spectacular white color.  Right after that they took off really, really fast.  Faster than any craft I have ever witnessed.  The desert sky was clear.  There was nothing left but the stars in the sky.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
a formation of 5 yellowish orange flexing noodles flying across the sky;2004-12-12 21:13:00;10 seconds;a formation of 5 yellowish orange flexing noodles flying across the sky It was half past nine on a sunday night, I was walking out of my apartment to my car, looked up and noticed five noodle shaped objects that were yellowish orange in apearance flying in formation very similar to a flock of canadian geese. The noodles seemed to bend and flex as if they were birds in flight. i heard the sound of jets but it could have been from the nearby airport. Having watched flights come in and out of the pheonix airport for awhile now I am positive that no airplne has ever looked like this. For a minute i thought that maybe it was birdsd flying in formation but they were moving much to fast. Within a few seconds they were gone.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Formation of three red lights.;2005-01-28 21:03:00;normal Friday night;Formation of three red lights. I saw it through my second-story window and went to see a better view outside. I knew at the first site that it wasn't normal. I called my mom and dad. I got a picture then I called a few friends to see it. It was a formation of 3 red lights making a triangle. Well a few minutes past and one of the lights fell from the formation like a bomb. It showed no sign of its landing. It dropped another and a few minutes later the remaining light enlarged then dissapeared like the millenium falcon going ito hyper-speed. I kept track, it dissapeared at exactly 9:06 PM.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
4 Orbs over Mesa, Arizona seen by at least three witnesses.;2008-10-30 17:30:00;40 min;4 Orbs over Mesa, Arizona seen by at least three witnesses. While golfing, my friend looked up and saw a pattern of four lights in the shape of balls high in the sky.  We watched them thinking they were weather balloons but they stayed in a triangle plus one pattern, kind of like the star formation of Cassiopeia.   The one farthest west turned a reddish color while we were leaving the golf course just before sundown.  I checked the sky at the same time today to see if the same pattern was there, but the sky was clear with no signs of the orbs.   I do part time astronomy and it was not Venus (not up yet and to low in the west, nor Jupiter, (in the south) and no star, yet four, are that bight to be seen like that while the sun is still up.   ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Date should be Wednesday 10/30/08 ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Venus, currently visible in the southwestern sky at sunset,  is seen to set in the western sky, as the Earth rotates to the east.

Formation of moving lights split off and hover.;2013-11-09 19:40:00;~10 minutes;Formation of moving lights split off and hover. Around 7:40 PM Arizona time on my way to work, I pulled over as I saw what appeared to be five lights flying in formation that gave the illusion it was one large object.  It could have been a military training flight with the formations, but I am not sure.  The light they gave off I can only describe as looking like a dim orange street lamp color, but large and bright enough to be seen very easily. After watching it fly in a single direction for a few minutes, the front three lights split up and formed a small-medium sized triangle.  I lost sight of one of the lights in the back completely, and the other one was still moving in the direction of the other three at a slow pace.  The triangle hovered for roughly three minutes.  After those few minutes, the lights of all three simultaneously faded from bright to nothing, with a bit of flickering, lasting in total around 30 seconds. Sometime in between the last sight of the back light and the fading of the three front ones, I lost sight of the last light behind a house.  I tried moving the car to a better location, but they were already gone.  That was everything I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was driving from Fountain Hills to my apartment using highway 87.;2014-08-05 20:50:00;10 seconds;I was driving from Fountain Hills to my apartment using highway 87.  As i was about a mile from Gilbert Road, i looked to the south towards Mesa, and the best way I can describe what I saw was that there were three orange orb-lights in the sky spaced pretty close to each other really far away (maybe 20 miles away, 5000 ft high) and as they started to dim out from left to right pretty quickly,   3 more lights appeared a little bit further away in a straight line.   As those started to dim out from left to right 3 more lights appeared.  And this happened about three to four times before they just disappeared completely.   The pattern these lights turned on and off reminded me of a caterpillar effect.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Bright lights;2015-03-21 22:00:00;~3 minutes;Returning home going east on Ray Road just east of Ellsworth at around ten at night.  This is a new housing development area with lots of daytime housing construction during the day and vast open areas.  I was in the passenger seat and saw six bright lights at a little above ground level to the ESE.  There are other lights in the area from warehouses and domestic homes.  These were in a horizontal line consistent with the ground and were different, spanning about 100 yards in width if my measure is correct.  My girlfriend was driving and commented on them and I wasn't sure what it was.  There were 3 passengers in the back seat and we all saw them.  Unlike mercury or sodium vapor lights, these looked incandescent, yellowish white, bright and large.  What stood out is that unlike the domestic and business lights to the left and right of this array, these had a hazy fog around them.... They were about 1/2 mile away... I wanted to go over there, but there are n! o roads ....  I have looked at that area every night since and it is dark....;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OVER MESA, ARIZONA TONIGHT 11/07/19.;2019-11-07 20:44:00;90 seconds;UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OVER MESA, ARIZONA TONIGHT 11/07/19. Hello, I just called in at 8:54 p.m. mountain time and spoke to Mr. Sky (Sic.  Davenport) himself.  At around 8:44 p.m. in Mesa, Arizona, I was standing in my backyard facing north and saw an unidentified flying object above. It was traveling in the northeast direction. This object, viewing it at a length size, had to of been comparable to the size of a football field or bigger.  I live under the flight path to Sky Harbor airport where the planes travel in the west direction to land. As the object was flying over the valley, it was silent. It had a very eerie feeling to it for the 60-90 seconds I got to experience. It was a grey/black object with 3 lights spread out equal length on the craft.  The lights were red, and the rear light was flashing red.  This object, like I said, was silent.  No lights on the object like a plane, no engine sounds, complete silence and darkness other than the 3 lights on the craft.  It slowly traveled over the Mesa area in the northeast direction and I lost eyesight of this object. This was not a plane. This was not a jet.  This was not a blimp.  This was not any craft known to man, I know this for a fact.  I am a very reliable source that has been studying this subject for years now and it is not my first experience.  However, this was the clearest and longest experience I have had to date. Thank you for taking the time to read my report and answer my phone call.  Hope to hear someone else had experienced this as well.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
