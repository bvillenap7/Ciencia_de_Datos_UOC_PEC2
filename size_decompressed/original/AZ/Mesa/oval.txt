Large gray Zeppelin or blimp shaped craft sighted north of Mesa, AZ;1995-06-01 18:00:00;30 min.;Large gray Zeppelin or blimp shaped craft sighted north of Mesa, AZ One evening in June of 1995 I saw a large gray Zeppelin or blimp shaped craft among some small gray clouds in the shadows over the mountains north of Mesa, AZ, East of Phoenix. The reason I'm reporting it as a UFO is that it had no markings or lights on it as required and was hiding in the clouds. I was driving West from Florence Jct. on Rt. 60 towards Mesa at 18:00 just before sundown and was still about 20 miles from Mesa when I noticed it among the clouds North of Mesa. At first it looked like 4 small clouds floating South but then 3 of the clouds continued to float South while the 4th one turned and went back North over the mountains when it looked like it might end up out in the open over the city. At that time I could make out the football shape and was able to identify the craft as a Zeppelin or something similar. I continued to watch it for about 30 min. as I drove West until it disappeared in the shadows over the mountains to the North. I've seen the Goodyear blimp and the Fuji blimp and it wasn't either of them, it was much too big, all gray and had no lights or markings on it and looked a lot like the one moored to the Empire State Building at the beginning of the movie Sky Captain.  The odd thing is I searched for Zeppelins on Google and the last one seems to have been decommissioned around 1940. This sighting was before the Phoenix Lights so I figure something like that carrying a structure underneath with some lights on it at night could have been the cause of some of the reported sightings. Then, last year I saw a story about a new model Zeppelin that was flying across Texas and Arizona on it's way to California about the same time all the UFO reports were coming from Texas. It was on the local news in Phoenix because it stopped briefly in Tucson. Here are some photos and information about the craft that flew to Calif. but I believe this one is smaller then the one I saw: http://zeppelintransit.blogspot.com/;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

MESA IN BROAD DAYLIGHT;2002-08-23 16:00:00;2 minutes;MESA IN BROAD DAYLIGHT One lower flying object was like floating in the sky in braod day light, and I said hey hey get up lok at that and then my nieghbors slowly stood up and it had gone around the trees. It looked like a Red rust color and it was  moving fast in a very slow way it was like bouncing along. I thought oh my God I am losing my mind, I just seen a UFO. It was not a plane, helicopter, or a good year blimp or  air balloon. It was something unlike anything I have ever seen. It was a UFO. Again it was a Red/ Rust color but I got a vague glimps of something blue on it, and it was oval but round in hiegth and it it had something consistent along the belly of the  craft like air holes or somtthing it was a consistent pattern all the way around.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Very large oval shaped object about the size of the City of Phoenix flying through the clouds.;2008-02-02 17:45:00;1 minute;Very large oval shaped object about the size of the City of Phoenix flying through the clouds. My family and I were driving from Queencreek AZ to our home in Mesa, AZ.  We were on the U.S. 60.   My wife was driving and I looked out in front of me at what I thought was a funny smoke shape about 30 miles plus away.  It had a ribbon like shape and was vertical  thus my thought it was smoke.  However it was in the middle of the horizon and maintained its shape for the entire duration of this experience.  I continued to watch this trying to figure out what it could be.  It seemed to appear and disappear over and over with a waving like motion.  I then saw these round like puffs that looked like something bursting in the air like when you see movies of flack but the smoke was white in color.  What really seemed strange was that this explosion then seemed to reverse in outward movement to inward and more condensed.  It was then that about 10 Miles away I saw something that looked at first like a hot air balloon going through fog.  It was at that moment that I thought, Wow there is fog really low going horizontal to the freeway.  Then it appeared again even closer and it the object came into view and looked more like the front end of a blimp, however it was huge.  I thought, wow that fog is alot closer to the ground than I thought and the blimp looked as if it was within 30 feet to the right of us.  It was then that I saw that my eyes seemed to adjust and realize that what I was thinking was a low fog was a very high cloud and around along ways away.  I yelled out loud, WHAT IS THAT?  I realized that whatever it was, it was the largest object I had ever seen.  I told my wife to look but she was driving and could not see what I was looking at.  It was at that time that we passed the 202 ramp and the 60 dipped.  I watched the object all the way until the wall next to the freeway covered my view.  My wife kept saying, should I pull over?   I didn't know what to do.  I kept waiting and looking to where I thought it would emerge from the end of the cloud into open blue sky.  It had been! clear a ll day and we where out at our with our friends and so clouds were the last thing I expected.  I did not regain view of the clouds where the object was seen and I told my wife to exit the freeway.  She exited the freeway at power road as I looked into the sky looking back and forth scanning the whole area for a low flying hot air balloon a blimp or something else as the path seemed to be heading toward the opening sky.  We drove north on power until Broadway and never again saw this object.  It was then that I saw  a jet flying in the opposite direction as the object I saw and the jet was still pretty high flying the normal pattern toward PHX Sky Harbor airport.  I gasped when I realized the magnitude of what I had seen.  The object dwarfed the plane like a plane against an upside down mountain.  I continued to reflect back on what I had seen and can only say that it was only the front end blimp shaped in front and the smoke like ribbon was the same object passing through the clouds giving the solid object the smoky like appearance.  It was not a cloud behind another cloud. It was a definite Oval object and I would estimate it from just the nose and from how far away the clouds where that it was bigger than the size of the city of Phoenix.  I don't know what it was, or what it belonged to. I know that I saw something and I know that it was a solid object.  I have never seen anything that big except for a mountain.  It was not a mountain.  The object I saw was skimming through the clouds and because of its huge size it through my perception of the actual distance of the clouds way off.  The planes that flew in toward Sky Harbor were still very high above the ground and the clouds where still higher in the air then they were.  No low flying  clouds.  These clouds where pretty high.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Oval object in the sky splits into three sections of light and start to rotate clockwise while moving to the west in Mesa, AZ.;2010-07-03 20:50:00;3 minutes;Oval object in the sky splits into three sections of light and start to rotate clockwise while moving to the west in Mesa, AZ. I was facing south when I saw an oval light object in the sky.  The object was not moving too fast that I could not make out what it was.  After about thirty seconds the oval light split into what appeared to be three sections and was rotating in a clockwise direction.  There was also a smaller red dot light above it. The object was moving slightly north and coming from the south.  It then began to move to the west and slightly to the south again.  After about three minutes total it was too far for us to see anymore because there were trees in the way. I compared the object to air planes and helicopters around the area after the sighting and it was larger and not comparable to the lights of our aircraft.  If you can look at a full moon and picture a sliver of the middle and slightly smaller, that would be about the size of this object.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Silver windowless oval sitting near the top of a mountain in full daylight;2020-02-02 17:05:00;5 minutes;Silver windowless oval sitting near the top of a mountain in full daylight This object was a silver oval that was sitting on the top of a mountain (possibly Dome MT.) in the Tonto National Forest, to the southeast of Bush highway.  I was watching the Super Bowl on my phone with money on KC. The game was still in the first q. But we entered the short stretch of Bush Highway where data networks can't reach. So I was able to enjoy the natural beauty of this stretch of road. The visibility was unlimited-crystal clear afternoon desert skies.  Far off in the distance at elevation, a glint of silver caught my eye. My first thought was of an old-style Airstream trailer. But there is no way any type of vehicle could have been up there. It was sitting in an odd spot, not quite at the top of the peak but on a small outcropping just below. It's extremely rugged terrain on foot-let alone for anything heavy.  No windows, no struts, no markings. Just a seamless silver oval-not moving. The driver of the vehicle confirmed that he could see it as well and we both agreed on the description. We also concurred that it was impossible for a vehicle to be present at that location. We were able to observe it for less than five minutes as the road took us out of its view.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
