Two bright red lights in the southwestern sky;2000-08-15 20:05:00;about 10 min.;Two bright red lights in the southwestern sky I observed two round red lightts in the south western sky. they were very bright red and did not seem to move or make any sound. three airplanes were visable traveling nearby during this time. After about 5 minutes the first light seemed to dim and go out but the the second remained. Finally when one of the airplanes seemed to approach it it faded out.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Round object just hovering over homes.;2001-09-11 20:30:00;3minutes;Round object just hovering over homes. Two days prior to my 9/11/2001 sighting, I saw a round object  flying very high in the southern skies over Arizona.  On 9/11/2001 at approximately 20:30 I was walking my two dogs.  There were no airplanes flying this day because of the terrorist attack, except for military jets from Luke Air Force base.  I just came around the corner and between two homes I saw a bright light coming toward the homes in front of me.  I thought it was the police helicopter flying with their search light on.  I watched the light get closer to me and there it was just hovering over the neighborhood homes.  It was just there, no sound coming from it at all.  The two dogs never reacted to this object.  It hovered for just a few minutes and then it took off, straight up and the started to head west.  This is exactly what I had seen in the sky two days earlier. The most interesting thing was the lack of noise or any sound coming from this object.  The speed of it taking off was incredible. I have not reported this to any authority because I did not want any repercussions to this.  I have told several people since and I just get that look of disbelief.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

I immdediatly got some friends who live near by and asked them to come and tell me if I was nuts or not! They also witnessed the small circles of light moving in the sky. There were about ten different perfectly round circles moving around each other, often times converging together. I grabbed my video camera and attempted to video the images in the cloudy sky, as soon as I started filming, a heavy rain started. Once the rain let up, I returned outside as the objects were still there, I did record some of the movements, but only one of the circular objects came out on video tape. The other circular objects did not appear to record. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the incident might have been caused by a laser-based advertising light, but that is strictly conjecture.

Large bright light appeared in sky  overhead and then quickly dropped down out of my sight.;2004-05-15 21:37:00;3 seconds;Large bright light appeared in sky  overhead and then quickly dropped down out of my sight. I was sitting outside in my hammock reading a book when I suddenly saw a large, bright light in the sky. It seemed to have a glow around it, also. It didn't appear to have come from anywhere, it was just suddenly there. Then it appeared as if it started to fall. My first thought was a falling star but it was way too big and had no tail or anything like that. It moved very quickly. By the time I got out of the hammock and ran to the middle of the patio for a better look, it was gone. There were no sounds of aircraft. I do live between 2 small airfields but I have not seen anything move that fast, that was that big without any sound at all. This is the first ufo report I have ever filed. I can't think what this could have been which is what prompted me to do this. I am hoping someone else reports it also just so I know I didn't imagine it. My dog started barking at the same time also. So, did both the neighbors dogs, now I think of it. As for my background, I am just your average Joan, reading a book in the backyard, enjoying a nice evening before it gets unbearably hot. Since it was dark, I did have the patio light on. I also had my glasses on. I even questioned if perhaps there had been some wierd reflection but I could not recreate anything that even came close to it. I am not prone to fabrication. I am very science oriented as my entire adult life has been spent in medicine. All science and facts. Thanks.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Brilliantly glowing object could move directionally anyway, silent and houvered in a circular pattern and was a circular shape.;2007-01-06 23:30:00;30-60 sec;Brilliantly glowing object could move directionally anyway, silent and houvered in a circular pattern and was a circular shape. I  am a non drinker, nor drug user.  I work for a church and have never seen what I considered a UFO, though I do believe such phenomena exist.   On Jan 6, 2007 at approximately 11:25 PM, I was standing in my backyard when I looked directly southward into the sky and noticed what appeared to be brighter than normal airplane or helicopter lights. It was approximately 4 miles south and about 800-1000 feet off the ground.  At first, I thought maybe it might be a blimp coming in my direction so the display would be on its eastern facing side. But as I watched the lights I saw that it was moving faster than a blimp would and it seemed to turn to the west and sit stationary with 6-8 white lights in a circular to square configuration. The lights alternated from all white to red.   Having seen numerous airplanes being situated in the airplane flight path to Sky Harbor Airport, I observe that most aircrafts have 2 flight lights in the center with one red and one green light on the end of the wings.  These lights I witnessed seemed more brilliant than normal and the manner in which it flew was unlike any aircraft I had ever seen.  It seemed to float in a circular pattern and also moved directionally slightly to the east and then west and up and then down before it turned and headed west.   At this point I went inside to tell my friend to see this.  Her report has been sent in also.   We immediately came out and as I was describing to her what I saw, we both saw in the south west sky approximately 1-2 miles off, a glowing object seemingly hanging in the sky about 40-60 feet in width.  I don’t know if this was the same object or a second one as I had gone in the house for about 30 seconds to get my friend.  It didn’t appear to be a helicopter or airplane.  It appeared to turn on its left side and I saw a bright singular light and 4-6 smaller lights surrounding it in a ring shape pattern.  Although dark in the sky, I could see that it was an aircraft with a shape unlike an airplane.  It moved without any engine sound or propeller sound.   It stayed for about 10-15 seconds before floating westward quickly and silently.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

I am a public school teacher and do not drink or do drugs.  I have never seen a UFO nor have I, until now ever placed much stock in the belief of such occurrences.  I am reporting a sighting I witnessed at approximately 11:30 PM on Jan 6, 2007 in Mesa AZ.   My friend called me into the backyard to see what he called an unusual aircraft.  I was standing in my backyard facing south and saw a very bright orb or ball of light approximately 1000 feet above the ground and about 1-2 miles away..  It was about 40-60 feet in width, stationary, glowing and hovering just above my treetops.  It remained there for approximately 5 seconds, then floated slightly downward in a vertical direction, immediately slightly sideways in a western direction and then started turning westward.  As it turned, it tilted downward and the light became less evident and its shape was more visible.   It was a circular aircraft with what appeared to have as one brilliant head light with a circular light pattern of about 6 lights around it.  The lights were mostly white and red, switching to either all white or just all red.  It was silent and did not make a normal jet engine sound or any sound that would indicate to us that it was a helicopter or airplane.   Living in the Phoenix area we witness nightly, helicopters with spotlights.  This was not at all similar.   As the object floated westward it did so silently.  Within 10 seconds I could no longer see it.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Three circular lights clearly not typical aircraft floating and moving away smoothly.;2008-11-09 20:30:00;40-60seconds;Three circular lights clearly not typical aircraft floating and moving away smoothly. While driving eastbound on Main Street between Val vista and greenfield roads my stepfather and i witnessed 3 bright lights separated randomly in the sky. The first two lights were in the north with one a bit further east and it seemed to be a bit closer to us.  The light closer and to the east (will be further reffered to as light 1) seemed to be shone in our direction because of the way the rays came off the light and how bright it was.  Light two did not seem either as bright or to be shone in our direction. Light one seemed to be floating and not really moving in any direction until it slowly turned the light toward the south and began to move across the sky.  The light didn't seem to move in any massive speed, but it did not go slowly either. (i am a terrible judge of speed and distance)  Light #3 was in the south east and was slowly moving south.  Lights 2 and 3 were not nearly as bright as one and thus i seemed to really only watch 1.  It was also the closer light so it caught my attention more.  My stepfather was mostly watching the one from the passenger side which was in the south on his side of the car. I know what an airplane looks like as i live under the flight path for Sky Harbor and these lights did not blink and had no red to them at all.  I also concluded it could not be a police chopper because for the light closest to us to be that bright the chopper would have to literally be aiming at us.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Big Round Circle UFO Sighting, A.M.;2011-07-23 06:50:00;10-15 seconds;Big Round Circle UFO Sighting, A.M. I was driving W on Guadalupe Rd. in Mesa, AZ, from Ellsworth Rd.  As I was driving I noticed off in the distance, above a Walgreens, positioned SE what appeared to be a black hot air balloon. It was big and barely moving, if at all.   As I was looking at it, slowly, my skepticism grew.  As I drove for another 5-6 seconds, I considered turning on and grabbing my video camera that I had in the car with me. I am doubtful when it comes to a UFO sighting (I've always wanted to see one) so I feel as if my mind plays tricks on me.   This was no trick.  It was huge.  And as I drove with smy head out my drivers side window and stared, I rolled through a light.   There were 3 ladies out running on the corner, and they had stopped to wait for the light.  I looked at them to see if they were seeing what I was seeing but it did not seem like it.   The UFO hadn't left my sight.  So I turned my camera on and pulled into my neighborhood.  As I drove in, the houses blocked the UFO.   When I returned to open road, couldn't have been more than 25-30 seconds, it was gone from sight.  It was then that a weird feeling started to kick in, almost of disappointment.   It was huge in the sky. Impossible to miss.  Looked like a big black ring with a weird center type and a little tiny upside down triangle on the bottom.   As soon as I saw it, it seemed to be gone.  I wish I would've shot a photo or shot some tape of the UFO but it was all over so fast.   Still hard to believe.

It got to about 25% of the size of the moon. Then about 5 to 8 min latter just a little to the East it happened again just not as big, but just as bright and it did not last as long. Any one else see it, can anyone tell me what it was.  Also, I saw the same thing last Wednesday night (May 23) in the North Eastern sky, this one was a little more orange.  But what caused me to write about it and search for an answer for what I was, each had no tall. It was just a burst of light.  Like in the meteor fall that leaves a tail showing the direction of the fall, these all had no tails, no streaks? What is it, anyone know?   ((name deleted));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

They then started to make sudden movements, one by one they would slowly (best described as) &quotstretch&quot to the left leaving a light trail  expanding slightly, into a vertical cylinder...then would dim almost completely out leaving a very tiny light.  One by one this happened until all four seemed to disappear, but then as soon as they dimmed they rapidly re-lit, repeating the same sequence until they dropped below the housing development in front of me!  The entire time they stayed in the square formation seemingly stationary yet slightly dropping towards the horizon....;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

The object was white and I could not make out a true shape other than an oval or circle.  It flew just below the clouds.  I watched it fly past in a line from west to east. I heard no sound and saw no other lights or flashes.  I started to think it might be a bird, but never saw a wing flap, and, as I stated, it flew in a perfectly straight line.

Magenta-Violet Orb Moves Abnormally Through Eastern Mesa Sky.  ((anonymous report));2018-06-10 20:00:00;30 minutes;Magenta-Violet Orb Moves Abnormally Through Eastern Mesa Sky Saw a circular UFO while walking my dogs tonight around 8:00pm MST. Glanced up and saw a violet-turning-magenta colored circular figure (I can only explain the violet color as looking like your nails do when you're in a room that has a black light on) in the sky sitting dead still.  At first I thought it may be a plane or helicopter coming straight toward me, appearing to be still, but then the object started moving to the left (eastern sky beginning at dead-center east, then slightly left of east across horizon and back).  The object moved slowly to begin but glided unlike anything I have ever seen. It then stood at a dead stop once again for about 30 seconds.  After this it ZIPPED QUICKLY AND UNNATURALLY to the left about an entire palms-length when held up to the horizon. After this it stood still for a moment once more, then zipped back to the right to its original position and lowered itself straight down at an unnatural speed.  This happened three times and I have three separate videos of the event. Directly before recording the third video, a helicopter made a brief attempt at chasing the object (which prompted me to run into my home to grab my camera for a third recording).
