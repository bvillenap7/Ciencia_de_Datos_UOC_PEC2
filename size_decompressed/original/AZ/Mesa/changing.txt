These lights were in the form of a giant flying wing. It appeared solid. I was driving north and increased my speed to intercept the appearant UFO. My speed reached 90 MPH to put the target on the collision course for me to pass under the appearent UFO to achieve a CPA ( Closest Point Of Approach). I ran out of road and was forced to pull over to the right of the road prior to CPA. After pulling over possibly a minute or so passed and I witnessed the following. The White Lights broke apart and formed a single trane of small aircraft which follwed one another in exact spacing and altitude so exact to land at Falcon Field in Mesa Arizona that I belive they were not under manual control but automated control. This airfield is close to Hughs Helicopter that makes the Apache Helicopter. Also Called McDonald Douglas. It is my personal belief from what I witnessed there has existed for some time an AutoPilot that can control the actions of a group of small aircraft and that is what many people are reporting as giant flying UFOs that look like a series of lights and give the impression of being a solid thing. The precision and accuracy of flying that I witnessed would seem almost impossible for individually piloted group of planes. Although I was able to Identify this Appearant UFO I think I would not have been able to if I had not actually witnessed the landing at Falcon Field In Mesa Arizona in the Early 1990s. I genuinely think they were under GROUP Automated Control and not Individual pilots. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
I saw for a 2nd time a cigar or  oval object that seems to flip and bobel as it's flying changing form from oval to doubled winged shap;2004-03-20 18:45:00;5 minutes;I saw for a 2nd time a cigar or  oval object that seems to flip and bobel as it's flying changing form from oval to doubled winged shap This is my 2nd time reporting and each time I have seen the same object, but on my last report I left out a couple  details than the one im reporting now. My last report was on 1/17/04, but i have seen this object on a total of 3 times. well on 3/20/04 between 6:30pm and 6:45pm my son, who also witnessed this sighting twice, ran into the apartment and said the same object is outside again dad, I ran outside this time my wife was a witness and to my suprise there it was, it was travling from west to east coming from phoenix and tempe to mesa between 8th ave and extention where I live. It was travling at a speed and altitude that a helecopter would travel, the object is about the size of a helecopter but it's not a helecopter. The object is black and when it's moving iit seems to be bobbling or flippin continusly, it makes no sound at all. The first time i seen the object on 1/17/2004 it was moving very slow but on 3/20/04 it was moving fast and coming straight for us, I was waiting for it to past over us to see under it and to see it closer but it suddenly stopped and began to travel upward into orbit but at a slow speed as it did last time on 1/17/2004.The object seems to change shapes from a cigar or oval shape and as it's flipping appears to change into a doubled winged shape object. about 10 minutes after seeing this my son reported while ridding his bike he saw another one, this one was black on one side and red on the other side when it flipped over. I'm very upset because i had to pawn my video camera back in december 2003. I'm 33 years old and work partime at Skyharbor airport, I often see military aircraft taking off from the national gaurd next to the airport but I have never seen anything like what I have been seeing. Also shortly after the object leaves, on each occassion, a helecopter shows up and seems to circle the area..;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Five very bright, solid yellowish, to golden lights that changed shape and format.;2008-09-05 20:18:00;10 min;Five very bright, solid yellowish, to golden lights that changed shape and format. While traveling west bound on East Apache Trail in Mesa heading towards Ellsworth Rd I noticed 5 very bright golden yellowish lights. The shape appeared to be curved like on the side of a circle. I continued east than merged onto the 202 freeway just west of Ellsworth lights were not in view obscured by a freeway wall. When I merged onto the 60 highway west the lights became visible again. At this point I could tell the lights were not connected to one object because the shape changed into a wide “V”. At this time I heard and saw two helicopters approaching. The lights were directly in front of me, one helicopter was headed from the south and stayed south of the lights. Another helicopter stayed north of the lights, so the lights were almost in the middle of two helicopters. I arrived at my destination on Power rd just north of the 60 and exited my car at this point only three bright lights remained and were not in any formation. I entered the store and upon exiting no lights were visible. I called my local news station who informed no other reports had been made at that time. Thanks;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Two slow, black heart changing to tear shaped objects decend with no lights and unheard witnessed by family over e.Mesa,AZ!;2012-03-29 19:10:00;7 to 10 mins;Two slow, black heart changing to tear shaped objects decend with no lights and unheard witnessed by family over e.Mesa,AZ! I was standing outside watching the kids riding bikes, one of them asked what was in the sky. I look went inside to grab family and binoculors, came back to see 2 black heart shaped objects wiht out lights or sound going from north to south about 05 to 10 natical miles apart.  For about 7 to 10 min. they have traveled about 35 to 50 natical miles guessing by judgment that is, as they decended they both changed shape to a tear and slowly disappeared in altitude.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
UFO in Mesa, AZ, 30 lights to 20 than 10 disappearing and made T-shape and Triangle shape before disappearing.;2014-06-12 21:42:00;28 minutes;UFO in Mesa, AZ, 30 lights to 20 than 10 disappearing and made T shape and Triangle shape before disappearing. As I sat in my computer room doing research, guns went off I of course ignored them. About three minutes later my mom came running in the house telling me to go outside.  My neighbors across the way said there were 30 lights over their house which moved in the direction of NE from Sky Harbor airport, from the location of my house the lights were NW.  I am a amateur deep space astrophotographer, so I definitely can identify any normal aircraft or lights in the sky when I see them.  By the time I got outside there were 20 lights.  I did not want to move for fear I might miss something.  I ran to grab my Canon rebel T3i with the telephoto lens.  When I went outside my hands and body were so shaky, I guess that is why spare of the moment photographs of UFO's are not clear.  My neighbor however got a video.   While all this was going on the lights dropped down to ten, still ascending NW.  At this point my dog in the house was going crazy.  Once the lights got to about 7 or 8 they began to make a triangle formation.  It looked like a triangle with one flat side parallel to the ground with the top tip point bent forward while it all rotated on a lazy-susan.   When any of the lights began to disappear they would blink in and out then slowly fade into a dim disappearance.  The video shows three lights stationary while a helicopter goes across  ithttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1OLecTpZy4 .   One of my neighbors who witnessed the UFO's is a aircraft mechanic, he could not identify any aircraft that he knows to make such formations or behave in such a way.   The lights traveled NE and disappeared both away from sky harbor and my house.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Is that a star?;2017-09-21 05:15:00;2 miniutes;Is that a star? Sitting outside when we noticed what seemed to be a star bouncing around.  Grabbed my iPhone to take photos and use Stargazer App.  With  the naked eye looked like a star. Zoomed into the object and took about 20 photos of the object as it changed shape and color.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
