Large yellow orange fireball gliding across the sky ejected a small fireball straight down beneath it.;1998-11-03 21:00:00;10 minutes;Large yellow orange fireball gliding across the sky ejected a small fireball straight down beneath it. Early November I witnessed an object gliding across the night sky moving SE across Mesa, AZ. It appeared to be a yellow orange fireball with a medium tail trailing behind moving faster than an aircraft going away from me.  The angle from horizon to overhead was 70 degrees when I spotted it. As it moved towards the horizon and got farther away, what appeared to be another very small round fireball was ejected straight down beneath this object and appeared to burn up and tnen disappeared as it separated a distance below the larger object.  The larger object continued on its path for a few minutes until at about 20 degrees from the horizon it suddenly disappeared.  It instantly vanished as quick as you could snap your fingers.  The object made no movements other than a straight glide across the sky and was bright making it clearly visible.  As I am involved with astronomy I am certain it was not a meteor, comet or a satellite burning up in the atmosphere because those objects move rapidly through it and the burn rate is quite quick.  A comet that close would have caused destruction as this object was in the lower level of the atmosphere.  Since the object made no sound at all which it would have that close it was not a meteor. Additionally the object moved too slow for a meteor or comet or satellite. It was not an aircraft in trouble because the object moved too fast with no sound. The shape was definitely a compact ball! I have checked various professional astronomy resources and have received no explanations as yet. The object appeared to be too low to have skipped off or grazed the atmosphere and then back out into space. My background is that of 31 years as a teacher in ((technical field deleted)) science and presently ((title/company deleted))  Institute, Inc.- MS degree plus 15 graduate hours in Astro-Physics.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
2 glowing orange fireballs in the sky;2003-08-27 20:45:00;15 min;2 glowing orange fireballs in the sky My husband and our 2 children were driving to the store and noticed 2 glowing orange balls hovering over the valley in the distance.They appeared as fireballs in the sky,(ironically enough we were going to the store to rent the movie 'Fire In The Sky'). We decided to drive toward them, as we got closer one of them disappeared altogether.Eventually driving through the valley with all the buildings we lost sight of the remaining object.The object, last we seen, was pretty close to the ground--or so it seemed. However, there was a helicopter that was in the vicinity we thought the object had been in. (and the video store didn't even carry that movie!)

Bright red light east of Mesa.;2003-12-01 19:30:00;5 secs;Bright red light east of Mesa. As I went to empty the garbage, I looked towards the east to see a very bright red light stationary approx. 30 degrees above the horizon.  I had seen a simular type light, about half as bright on 20Nov03 at 6:30 pm local.  The light on 20Nov seemed to vary in brightness with a irregular rhythem before dropping suddenly and flickering out from my position in Mesa.  The light I seen on 1Dec03 appeared to be in the same area, but was quite steadily intense and stationary.  A woman I saw walking her dog just before I emptied my garbage, was nowhere to be found whilst I looked for any witnesses to opinion with. I immmediately ran inside my apartment and phoned my wife at her work that a red light was in the sky again. I grabbed a pair of binoculars and ran outside and the red light was gone.  I waited a few minutes to see if it would reappear.  It did not.  Since Mesa sees much air traffic, It would be unpractical to discern chase planes.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

The sun was rising from behind the mountains so that little speck of a clout was shining super bright in the sky.   I train my eyes on the freeway and when I looked back I appeared as if the atmosphere had changed this illuminous cloud, the bottom had fallen down and it was now elongated top to bottom.  I look back a third time and it was even longer but a round circle was there ad I'd an explosion took place below the original cloud/light.  As the newly formed bottom parts disappeared the original cloud remained but a small star was under it where the other mass had been.  Then the star slowly descended behind the Superstition Mountains while the Sun in view thru my same wins hill (sic.  windshield??) kept rising up.  Shouldn't the star and the sun both have risen upwards?  Yes, if it was a star.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
