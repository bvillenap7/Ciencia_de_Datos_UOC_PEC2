UFO over Phoenix...over my back yard.  March 1997;1997-03-17 20:35:00;5 secs;UFO over Phoenix...over my back yard.  March 1997 I have been silent about this encounter because I was afriad of what people might think.  But I have seen a bunch of TV information and programs speaking of this incident (UFOs over Phoenix) and I must tell what I saw so it may help people and investigators plot its coarse.  At around 8:30 (can't remember exactely what time) a saw bright blue-white lights pass directly over my house.  It completely lit up my entire back yard and the green field behind my house.  To see my backyard I was looking North out of my house.  The lights traveled right to left or east to west.  My wife was also present.  She was looking slightly away or to the side when the lights flew by.  When they did fly by it of coarse lit up the entire backyard and the living room which we were in at the time.  I also yelled out loud when it occurred so she did turn around and see them after I did.  We ran outside about 15 - 20 secs later because I was a little cautious, only to see nothing - not a trace of what it was.  About 30 minutes later there was a special news report on the TV about lights over Phoenix then I knew what I say was true.  If you feel you need more info or need to contact me please do so.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
