Events throughout my life;1979-06-01 20:30:00;45 mins;Events throughout my life   I am not wanting this to be shown.. I have written several times . Many of my reports do not have accurate dates. I have had several things happen.  Anyway.. I have a question that I am hoping someone will have an answer to.   When I was in 6th grade , approx 11 years old, my family and I witnessed an exstreamly large craft go from the west to the east side of town and directly over our home. It started out looking like a brilliant , bright  white light traveling very slowly from the west phoenix area. We were alerted to it by my brother who was on his way home with his father who lived in Scottsdale. He noticed it while on the freeway and was very concerned to see it still in the sky when he arrived to our home which was at Gaudalupe and Dobson rd. My whole family- Mother ,grandparents , step father and one of my brothers friends- all went outside to see what he was so upset about. We observed this  object coming closer to us . It was , no joke, about the size of a football field. It didn't have lights on it like it looked from far away. As it got closer we could see it was illuminating from within. It made no noise, just a low kind of warm humming sound. Not like a blimp. It was flying  low and it was  exstreamly large. I would say if you were to hold your hand out you would have to put two fingers together to cover it. My step father worked at air research at the time and even he was puzzled as to what it was. It was not a blimp, plan, or helicopter. It looked like it had windows completely around it, or possibly metal  panels and if I remember right it almost (im not trying to make a joke) but it kinda looked like the starship enterprise. Only in the sense that It seemed to have two sections to it. It was moving super slow .When it reached the end of our block it swayed a bit and you could see it was wider that our street. It then sped up and took of ,very fast north east and was gone. Absolutely gone. The next day I said something to my teacher.. He got very excited and made me go to the principles office and draw a picture for the principle. They both questioned me.. My teacher had seen it also and was using me to try to help prove his story.. It was very outrageous and I am sure very unbelievable if you hadent seen this for yourself.. I am getting to my question.. please be patient.  .. Now when I was sixteen, living in the same home, I had a very unexplainable event. I was coming home from my best friend house .. She lived 2 miles from me. I left at exactly 8:50PM .. I know because we use to watch the Waltanns religiously- of all shows!! anyway,  the show ended at 9pm. I was also due in at 9 , if I was late I would be grounded.. At sixteen that is the worst thing in the world to have happen.. My parents were strict and I was never late. So I pulled in front of the house , shut off my VW bug and then I was surrounded by the most intense blue-white light. My car kinda rumbled .. Its very hard to explain. I at the time thought I had been hit by lightning,I could feel the energy. Thats what I attributed it to at that second,  without realizing it was a totally clear night. The color of the light was  not a color I can explain.  It was blueish white. It consumed me and the whole car. Then it was over and I jumped out of the car and ran in. I was greeted with two VERY upset parents. I was an hour late. I had completely forgot what had just happened.. Even when trying to defend myself. I had no excuse and was very confused.. All I know is I left at 8:50 and walked in at 10pm.  I called my friend sobbing, screaming at her for making me late.. She defended the fact of when I left and said I was crazy. I was traumatized because I was not allowed to see my boyfriend for a week, or talk on the phone.. I didnt recall the light thing for about 3 to four years later. To this day my friend remembers the event.. We are still very good friends.. We still cant explain why i was late or what happened.. I am writing wondering if anyone has had a similar event.. If anyone has seen something then while at the same location they have a loss of time or some other unusual event.. Is it possible that the first time we saw the craft it was the first of several visits? I am not making much sense.. I guess I am wondering -if it is possible that abductions occur, do you think they make a planned route that they trav! el?.. Do they scope out , or survey areas and people  first?  I am confused and still want to understand what happened.. I have had 2 other events in my life where I have had the same light consume me. It is an unforgettable color I have never seen duplicated, even in the movies.  Only one of the other  times  I have  a witness to my time loss. Again, at the time you forget what has just happened, and are left just completely confused. .  All the times I remember seeing the light , but never seem to be able to comprehend it or associate with what is or has happened. I am not a very good writer, I hope this makes sense to someone.. I really hope I can get some kind of understanding of this.. Is there any other people in Az that something like this has happened to them? One thing I did not mention.. The friend of my  brothers who witnessed the ship with my family the first time, he still to this day will not talk about it.. He will admit he saw it, but CAN  not elaborate. I tried to talk with him about 6 years ago and he gets all sweaty and freaked out.. He actually almost crys.. He cant talk about it for some reason.. Im wondering if  possibly something happened to him and he remembers it too much.. Or is it possible he had bad things done to him, or ma bey his mind cant comprehend something that happened to him that night? I am hoping someone can give me some kind of answer or insight... ..

I came to a stop at the light and looked up. Although it appeared to be silver it pretty much blended in with the blue sky. It was a combination of tear drop and egg but it just hovered there while i stared at it closer to the ground than an airplane. no noise no movement. the light changed and as i drove away i lost sight of it. Dont know how long it stayed there.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Bigger than a house floating in the sky.I know what,I saw, but don't know why!;1995-06-01 12:00:00;5   min;Bigger than a house floating in the sky.I know what,I saw, but don't know why! Sunny day with a few , what I call marshmello clouds, I looked up to enjoy the   beutiful clouds,when all of a sudden a large,round saucer come out from behind        a .cloud.  Larger than a football field   There was no sound at all. Silver or white   it reminded me of what the hills must have seen. the flat side was toward the ground,and it just sat  there,like it was waiting for me to do something.  I wasn't scared, just     wondered what it was going to do, come down or go up.  Finally, it went straight up.  Flat like a pancake, then as come another cloud it tilted edge wise and went into the cloud,that was higher than the one it came out of.  I presume so it would not      disturb the cloud. I don't know why I saw it,maybe they wanted me to know they are here.    I just got a computer or I would have reported it sooner. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were getting our lawn chairs from out of the pickup when my companion noticed somthing moving above and behind the mountian. It was contrasting agianst the sky. The object wich shape i was unable to make out was darker that the dusk sky. It seemed to float  and move frm north to east slowly . Then it was gone it didnt disapear but it faded away. We dont know what it was but it was strange enough that  my friend and i had to tell someone;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Observed a dark, oblong craft fly over Mesa, AZ approx. 5 minutes after watching Air Force One pass by.;2002-09-28 17:30:00;2 minutes;Observed a dark, oblong craft fly over Mesa, AZ approx. 5 minutes after watching Air Force One pass by. I was playing ball in the yard with my children and some neighbors late in the afternoon of 9/27.02. Pres. Bush was in town that day for a fund-raising dinner. I live approx. 10 miles due east of Sky Harbor Intl. Airport. Air Force One had taken off to the west and we were watching it climb as it swung around to the east. I had called my wife outside to watch it with us. Shortly after Air Force One went out of site, I noticed a dark shape that appeared to be drifting across the sky. At first, I thought it was a black or dark-colored party balloon. Then we noticed it was larger than a balloon and was not drifting, but seemed to be moving under its own power. The shape was oblong, like two spheres joined together. There was no observeable texture to the surface or any reflections. I estimate the size at 8 to 10 feet long, and 2 to 3 feet tall. It appeared to be at about 300 to 500 feet in altitude and moved steadily at approx. 50 mph. It made no sound as it flew in a straight line to the southeast. The altitude and speed never seemed to vary. The craft would have passed almost directly over the downtown Mesa area during rush hour and would have been easily observed by hundreds, if not thousands, of people (if they cared to look up). There were other aircraft in the area, as we are directly under the glide path for planes landing at Sky Harbor. Airliners pass over our house every 20-30 seconds at that time of day. I'm interested to see if anyone else observed this craft at that time.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
V shaped object seen in Mesa, AZ 11/30/04 6:00pm;2004-11-30 18:00:00;30sec- 1 min;V shaped object seen in Mesa, AZ 11/30/04 6:00pm On Tuesday Nov 30th around 6:00-6:30pm I was walking down the stairs from my apartment heading to my car.  I was still on the third floor steps when I looked west up to the sky and i saw something very amazing!  I saw a V shaped craft with yellowish reflectors or lights heading east.  It was going the same speed as a plane.  I thought to myself are those a flock of bird? Is it a plane?  I watched it go by over my head and kept blinking my eyes and shifting them because i was amazed at what i saw.  If it was a flock of birds i was waiting for them to move a different direction as they always do.  I also looked for the blinking red lights that they have on a planes.  It didnt do or have either.... It was wierd because if you didnt look up you wouldnt notice it since the lights were very dimly lit or they kinda reminded me of reflectors and the Craft itself was almost transluscent although you can tell it was like matted black color. What it reminded me the most was the creature in the movie Predator looked like... sort of reflecting its surroundings, but yet you still are able to see the shape and color. It was still light out and i was able to see the shape which was like a V... with lights under it or reflectors.  It was going at a speed as a plane then it speeded up ... before it disappeared it tumbled (like a fighter jet pilot would do for fun) then POOF... it disappeared into thin air.  There was a plane heading towards it and i thought it might hit it, but it disappeared.  I KNOW that pilot had to have seen it.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
This was not a balloon, known aircraft,spotlight,,flair ,star, or planet.  What in our world was it?;2005-01-28 21:10:00;5 minutes;This was not a balloon, known aircraft,spotlight,,flair ,star, or planet.  What in our world was it? When I looked to the sky, I saw what looked like a red star. Not like what you see when you look at mars through a telescope, but a rich, bright, red star. It looked to be standing still, but when compared with the white stars around it, it was moving at a slow and steady pace. At about 21:14 when a plane flew over us (while well beneath the red star) it seemed to pass the object in question, but then the red star looked as if it flew away or simply fell with gravity toward the earth and faded out. It was hanging out in the southwest sky. This is where se saw it from the location of Dobson Ranch. Myself, my husband, and our neighbor all saw the same episode. Did anyone else witness this same thing?;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Slowly moving and stopped craft barely over my home stayed for 15 minutes.;2007-11-08 20:30:00;15 minutes;Slowly moving and stopped craft barely over my home stayed for 15 minutes. Approximately 8:30 pm, November 8th, 2007 I was sitting on my back yard patio, just outside the sliding back yard glass door. My wife was sitting just inside the glass door, sitting on the couch in her white nightly robe, and doing a cross word puzzle.  We were only about 10 feet from each other.  I was sitting facing my southern back yard brick wall that was approximately 60 feet from me, with the back of my neighbor’s home on the other side of the wall approximately 120 feet from me. Both of our homes were single story family homes in east Mesa Arizona. Each home was approximately 60 feet in width.  I was just sitting there relaxing and everything was very quiet when I suddenly saw some lights that looked like professional football stadium lights, only in a single row (not 2 rows), very slowly rising from in front of my neighbor’s home until they were exposed barely over the home’s roof.  The lights, in length, were looking to be about 10 feet past the west side of the home and about 30 feet past the east side of the home. This made the light fixture look to be about 100 feet in length and there looked to be about 10 lights, running horizontally. The light fixture looked to be about 6 feet in bottom to top height.  The lights were directly facing North, and my home.  My first reaction was that I was smiling a little and wondering what my neighbor was doing rising up lights like that, that were very large, at this time of night. That changed when I suddenly realized that the lights were now barely over the peak of my neighbor’s roof and very slowly moving over it toward my home.  Seeing this my next reaction, as I still sat in my chair, was that I realized the lights I was seeing were not on a pole, they were airborne, very low, and moving very slowly towards my home, with absolutely no sound.  It was then that I immediately stopped thinking about my neighbor.  When the lights had slowly passed over my neighbor’s home and were now over my back yard approaching my home, I stood up and walked off the patio and into my back yard as the lights slowly now went over me.  Approximately 2 minutes had passed from the time I first saw the lights. As I looked up I saw that the area behind the lights was black and suddenly looked like a very dark roof over my yard. It was then that I suddenly saw a red light over the top of me, approximately 6 feet in diameter, with what looked like a glass cover that looked almost like the exterior of a golf ball, although I did not see the red light come on. With the red light on directly over me I noticed that the light was not moving and that the front of the craft was just barely over the roof of my home and the rear of the craft was completely over my yard. It was now obvious that the craft was not moving. It was then that a noise was coming from the craft that was so loud I immediately looked at the ground and covered my ears. It was still very loud. I was immediately thinking that the whole block has to be hearing this and my wife is definitely coming out. The noise sounded like a combination of high wind and a high pitched engine sound. When I looked at the door of my home I did not see my wife coming out. When I saw that I ran to the door, stuck my head in, and told my wife quickly to come out side and see this, not describing what “this” is. She said that she is busy doing Sudoku, a form of cross word puzzle. I told her to come outside and I left the glass door open. The noise was still loud as I watched all of a sudden the red light start to move toward my roof. I ran back to the glass door and yelled at my wife to get outside and see this craft that’s over our home. It was then I was wondering why she could not hear this loud noise. My wife immediately got up and ran out the door meeting me quickly. Everything was completely silent again and I could not see the red light under the craft any more as it moved forward. My wife’s first view of the craft that I was seeing happened when the rear end of the craft was only now about 10 feet in front of us. My wife and I simply watched the rear of the craft move silently and very slowly to the front of our home.  There it stopped. My wife and I simply were silently just standing about 30 feet from the craft. The craft just silently stayed there about 5 to 10 minutes. On the bottom rear of the craft we saw 2 red lights spaced about 10 feet from each other and a craft height of about 6 feet.Then the craft started moving again with no sound and very slowly away from us. The strange thing is I do not, for some reason, remember how it left. My wife says the craft just disappeared. After the craft was gone my wife and I went back to the patio and talked about this event for about ten minutes and then didn’t again for a very long time, not even to our families. I must say that due to the craft being so low I could not see the width of the entire craft and from the rear the front large lights were not even visible. I also believe that the sound I was hearing was just in my head as my wife, even with the door open, did not hear any sound. I also state that there were no neighbors that even came out as the craft was hovering over me for that length of time and making that loud noise or just hovering in front of our home with absolutely no movement nor sound. Total time of this event was approximately 15 minutes. For the 3 years that followed this event I have had: Severe left ear infections and scabs that totally covered my left ear and back of my neck, and at times the left side of my face. Eye problems with swollen and red eye skin. This year my mind stopped remembering names and various things. October 2010 I had brain surgery after a tumor was found in my brain and then removed. It was then that the surgeon said he was not familiar with this kind of tumor and it had to be submitted to be investigated. It is called Glioblastoma Multiforme and I was told that most people die within 14 months which is December 2011 for me. I am not most people. I am sending this because I do wonder why this is killing me at the age of 54, and what is the primary cause my coming death. Doctors do not know why this cancer starts. I wonder about November 8th, 2007. I have told my doctors this and my surgeons. I have worked as a Production Planner for 23 years providing Weapon Systems to the United States Army, Marines, and the Armed Forces of Israel. My wife works for the same company as a Senior Quality Analyst and has for 21 years. Concluded. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Wabboling UFO effect.;2009-06-01 18:30:00;60 seconds;Wabboling UFO effect. Hello i was walking home from eating Mexican food at 6:15 pm on June 1st.  I looked up in the sky and I seen this rotating wabboling object in the sky.  It moved southwest over my apartments, and it finally went vertical over the bank.  It was probley pretty high but it was low for only a few seconds.  I didn't think it was a weather ballon, becuase weather ballons don't travel that quick.  It was at crusing speed I guess.  Than it was gone becuase it was to far away to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
