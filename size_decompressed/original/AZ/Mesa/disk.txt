They're here whether you like it or not.;1995-04-05 12:01:00;5 min;They're here whether you like it or not. I  was privileged to see a large craft on the corner of ellsworth and broadway on a sunny day with a few clouds in the sky.  It came out from behind a cloud or from with in the cloud.  Like the shape of a pancake, I didn't report it because or redicule.. Large as a city block or two, Uneventful it was just there.  As to say we are here,weather you like it or not. It sat there for about five minutes, as we looked at each other. Then it went straight up, flat side then as it got to another cloud higher than the one that it came out of.  Then it turned in its edge to go into the cloud, I presume  so it wouldn't destroy the cloud of which it would have done, it was so big. The color was white or silver It felt friendly..

white object appearing to be round with 5 cylinders protruding from bottom;2000-10-06 22:30:00;4 hours;white object appearing to be round with 5 cylinders protruding from bottom I am not sure what a weather balloon looks like so I am not sure what I was seeing.  I have never made a report before.  I was checking a tree in my back yard and looked up, almost direct overhead, high altitude was a white, but almost opaque but milky, filmy look, when the sun hit it glinted as if hitting bright reflection.  It looked at if something was protruding from the bottom.  I got my field glasses and through the glasses saw 5 cylinders coming from the bottom extending slightly out at the outer sides as if it could be a landing apperatus.  This object hovered for about an hour and a half then started moving slowly to the west where it disappeared around 2:30 to 3pm.  I would have not made this report but my daughter in Kansas mentioned she had heard of new sightings recently in Phoenix and Tucson.  I can't find any reports although a friend said she heard it mentioned on television that some had seen what I did and they did not know what it was.  I did take two pictures but I am not sure what they will show as I have not had the film developed. ((NUFORC Note:  Description is somewhat reminiscent of a high-altitude helium balloon.  Please see entries for 04OC00.  We will attempt to resolve this one.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Tiny, black dome-shaped object seen near Hwy 60 in Mesa;2001-07-07 19:45:00;5 minutes;Tiny, black dome-shaped object seen near Hwy 60 in Mesa Was traveling eastbound on the 60 and saw a small craft approximately 200 to 500 feet south, approximately 50 feet in the air. Craft appeared to be dome-shaped, black, and possibly 5 to 10 feet in diameter. The object had no lights, and there were no anomalous effects surrounding it. It hovered motionlessly in the air for most of the sighting, but occasionally drifted back and forth, and appeared to waver or change shape at one point. It may have been a black trashbag lifted by a thermal, but the shape seemed too symmetrical (except for the few seconds when it 'wavered', as if behind a heat wave). Driver confirmed the siting, but could not watch for the entire duration. Object disappeared after passing behind trees, and did not come out the other side.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Gold hub cap-like shape that bobbed along rather unsteadily.;2004-02-05 08:50:00;30 min;Gold hub cap-like shape that bobbed along rather unsteadily. When I first saw it I thought it was a partially deflated plastic baloon. It seemed at first to be changing shape but then I realized it was just changing its orientation from side to 3/4 view, roughly maintaining its top and bottom orientation. I ran in to get my binoculars and it had moved westrard, slightly north. It remained fairly low in the sky and did not move quickly, but rather unsteady, as if it were being pushed along by the prevailing wind  current. I tried to think of any one being in the craft, but thought that if there was any one there they must be unconcious because it seemed to just wander in a general westward direction. It appeared to be a gold hub cap-like shape, with some radial pattern on the top, which would catch the sun and flash its gold highly reflective color. It continued in this lolling manner for 30 minutes. I half expected it to zoom out of sight all of a sudden, but it just gradully bobbed along heading more directly west and out of sight.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Disk;2006-03-18 00:05:00;3 Secs.;As I went outside to smoke a cigarette, I looked at Moon to see what that the weather was doing.  Then I saw a disk (as large as the moon), traverse against the wind fly by.  No noise, no nothing.  It wasn't a balloon, nor a aircraft. Did anyone else see this?  It was so obvious how could anybody else miss it?? I'm only posting this in case somebody else saw it.  Thx;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Private pilot and passenger witness UFO in flight in northern Arizona Skies;2009-02-10 10:00:00;3 min;Private pilot and passenger witness UFO in flight in northern Arizona Skies I am a private pilot.  While co-piloting a 1959 B-95 Beechcraft Travel Air between Mesa falcon field (KFFZ) and St. George Utah (KSGU) I witnessed along with two others a spherical craft within approximately one statute mile of our position.  While making a course correction turn over the drake VOR at 150 knots 8500ft climbing to 10,500 approx heading 330 degrees(Prescott, AZ, according to GPS right after the event our exact posistion was 17 miles due east from the Prescott airport.)  I was visually scanning the sky for other air traffic prior and during a left turn.  Looking upward (off the starboard wing as it banked upward) the object in question came into veiw. It was a silver lenticular disk, I was the first witness to spot the object.  The passenger seated directly behind me was the second.  I asked the passenger to look up while still in the turn and to simply tell me what they saw.  The witness stated Oh my god... It's a flying saucer! (or somthing to that ! effect) By this time I had turned passed my intended heading.  I made a corrective turn passed the course in the opposite direction so I could see it again in another left hand turn.   We reaquired the target and attempted to photograph the object with a cell phone camera, without success.  It is difficult to judge it's exact size, however if it was anything close to a convetional aircraft in size it was within 1 to 2 miles almost directly above our aircraft.   As we continued our zig zag turns (in order to maintain a visual contact) on or about or third turn cycle the object began to climb in a spiralling arc through a broken cloud layer that was at about 12,500 plus feet at a very high rate (I estimated 500 to 700 knots possibly supersonic, I based this on my experience as a pilot and witnessing many supersonic fighter aircraft)  No condensation trail, and no visable exhaust trail and was out of visual range in under 8 seconds or so.   The rest of the flight was uneventful. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Self-luminous, flourescent-glowing , disc-oid object appears stationary in central Arizona skies;2009-09-10 18:00:00;4-8 Minutes;Self-luminous, flourescent-glowing, disc-oid object appears stationary in central Arizona skies At approximately 1852 Arizona time and for a duration of approximately four to eight minutes, three of four family members including an adult married couple and their twelve-year-old son observed a self-luminous disc shaped craft with a more cone-like underbelly which emitted an intense, even, luminocity in a visible light spectrum similar to the light emitted from flourescent home aquarium lighting.  The object was stationary and continued to be observed from the corner shopping center, surrounding streets, neighborhood and from any point on the family property adjacent to the eleventh tee of the Painted Mountain Golf Course in far northeastern Mesa, Arizona.  The duration of the sighting was between four to eight minutes with a desert monsoon thunderstorm cell moving in from the north at approximately twenty-five miles per hour ended the sighting by piling in to mask in part, then wholly obscure the apparantly stationary object.  The angle of observation f! rom the mean horizon (Horizon is mountainous and a badlands region) of approximately forty degrees of angle.  The Azimuth from the driveway of the witnesses' home was a north-northeast heading of approximately twelve degrees.  The size of the object was similar to that of a seseme seed when held at arm's length.  In binoculars, the object appeared to be flatter than an upside-down candy kiss, but disc-shaped, with a round top and a slightly cone-shaped extended belly. Cell phone photo images appeared as nothing more than a faded point of light.  No detsil was descernible. The sun had already set minutes before but the waning afternoon had not quite reached the twilight stage.  No stars were visible in the northern or eastern sky above or between thundercells.  The quality of the light on the object precluded any possibility of it being illuminated by reflected or refracted light from the sun due to it being the wrong color and spectrum. SPECIAL NOTE: OBSERVER'S OPINION:  If the object were in fact an intensely glowing helium weather balloon, the altitude would be above twenty thousand feet and the size of the expanded gas bag would be a quarter of the internal volume of a sports stadium.  The flourescent spectrum-appearing internal glow was of an intensity that battery power for such a structure would be the size of a Uhaul trailer and would be too heavy to lift. This thing appeared too brightly lit, and was possibly too big to be an air force of NASA balloon construction. The location in the sky was north of and to the left of the northeastern approach corridor for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and aircraft inbound and on approach to the runways were lined up to the east at an azimuth of approximately 80 degrees and were sporting intense, halogen landing lights in a spectrum completely different from the object.  That approach corridor takes the aircraft over the northern crags and spurs of Superstition Mountain and the Tonto National Forest. The entire flight pattern was at far lesser altitude than the object and was under the acumuated thunder cells inbound from both east and north. Lightning was flashing at a rate of severa discharges per minute both east and north from an azimuth of 120 degrees to zero degrees.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Bottle cap shaped UFO with red glow underneath, clearly seen from back yard on December 1st, 2009 .;2009-12-01 00:23:00;4 minutes;Bottle cap shaped UFO with red glow underneath, clearly seen from back yard on December 1st, 2009 . Estimated Distance: 2-5 miles Estimated Altitude: 2000 ft. Shape: Saucer with some height on sides like a bottle cap but double the relative height. Features: Red glow underneath with intensity that seemed to fluctuate in coordination with the UFO's movement. Story:  I went out side my home to have a cigarette - no smoking indoors. A red light first caught my attention.  As I looked on, I saw a saucer shaped object.  At first I assumed it was a plane or helicopter and it's altitude seemed close to the altitude where I have seen helicopters hovering in the past.  The UFO was descending and approaching.  Within 30 seconds the UFO was close enough to see very clearly but didn't appear to get closer than around a mile or two.  From my line of site the UFO began around 30 degrees above one of our trees in the backyard and eventually moved to low to see.  I walked to the other side of the yard in an attempt to see around this large tree but after 3 or 4 minutes couldn't locate the UFO so I went inside.  The UFO was in my view for around 3-4 minutes. My view of the object was clear and the UFO was absolutely not a helicopter nor airplane.  The craft appeared to move or float in all directions although it never made any radical maneuvers or cha! nges in acceleration. About this report: written 3 minutes after the sighting occurred.  Since I am not in some remote, isolated, location, it seems odd to view something so strange - whether it be a UFO or some air-force experiment. I cannot say what it was. All I can report as certain, is that what I saw was not any type of normal aircraft. I can't say whether it is due to the distance of the craft or not, but if the object was making any sound, I couldn't hear it. About the whiteness: 39 year old male who has never seen nor reported a sighting before.  I have also never experienced nor reported any form of anomalous or paranormal experience. My eyesight is currently 21x20 and I have never required or used glasses.  My house where this sighting occurred is located in a normal, non-remote, neighborhood and there are no buildings, high rises or stadiums near enough to view.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
I saw a half round disk object in flight zone then realized it was flying against flight path traffic normally flies.;2014-08-26 09:50:00;2 minutes;I saw a half round disk object in flight zone then realized it was flying against flight path traffic normally flys. So, I am driving in the city of Mesa, Az, on 9:50 am Tuesday, 08/26/2014, it was the first cloudless day we had in last week, being that we are in monsoon season and have had a particularly rainy season this year. I see what at first appears to be a plane at a glance especially being that the area is a fly zone over falcon field and sky harbor.  Then I realize I have never seen anything flying the opposite way of falcon fields mandated flight path allows.  Another detail that had me for a split second assume it was a commercial or private plane was it looked white, and almost textured, but at this time I was looking up at it and may have been looking at the bottom.  Then I noticed it was barely swerving slightly back and forth.  So slightly that unless you stared at like I did it could appear to be going straight.  This is when I was positive it was worth taking a picture at least. If my phone wasn't on verge of dying, I would have taken a video.  As I got my phone ready to take the picture the object was getting further away quickly even though we were traveling same direction.  When I took the picture I wasn't sure if I would be able to see anything.  And when you look at the picture you almost can't see anything until you zoom in then you can see it quite clearly.  So the time I observed it was about 2 min. approximately, OR the time it takes to travel 2 miles at 40 MPH might be a more accurate way to describe it. I snapped the picture, passed two palm trees, looked back up and the object in sky was gone.  Then I saw a commercial airliner fly by and noticed distinct blinking light on the belly and obvious wing shapes which the object I saw was lacking.   I turned east and by the time I got to my destination 2 miles up the road I observed 2 air force jets both flying straight up with the afterburners on and I remember thinking that they were going much slower than the object they were chasing.   The shape of the craft appeared to be somewhat cigar shape and with the white I was seeing is why it looked at a glance like a jetliner but it quickly looked different in shape but I think this is because of the angle not that it changed in shape and became very obvious to me it was wingless.  Half round in shape.  The best thing I can think of to compare with is a bike helmet which is kind of funny to me because I imagine both the helmet and the ship were built with aerodynamics in mind.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Once it got above me, I noticed it was circular in shape, a puffed out oval-like craft, similiar in appearance to the smaller spacecraft seen in the film, Independence Day, but without the protrusions on top of it.  It had a small trailing blue light nestled in the tail, and it reflected the setting sun off in a brilliant gleam from its metal.  I could literally see the sun shining off its body.  After it flew over the roof of a nearby townhome, to disappear from sight, I rushed to an adjacent road that had a better view, only to find it was gone!;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
