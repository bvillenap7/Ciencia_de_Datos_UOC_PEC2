A small dark purple quad-thruster craft hovering 200-300 feet in the sky.;1997-10-10 17:00:00;30 seconds;A small dark purple quad-thruster craft hovering 200-300 feet in the sky. I just recently have remembered an event that happened in my early childhood years.  I was about 8-9 years old playing football in my street with my brother and a friend that lived 2 houses over. I looked up into the northeast sky and noticed a small/medium craft hovering.  It looked to have 4 thruster looking devices on the underside of it.  If I could compare the underside of it to something, it looked like an one of those simon says electronic games.  Each of the 4 thrusters had a flap dangling from the outside rim of the undercarriage.  As the craft would ascend, the flaps would uncover the thruster simultaneously.  If it would descend, the flaps would cover them up.  The top side of the craft (not very visible to me) looked to be a half sphere. The craft's body was a black/dark purple shade. This took place in East Mesa, very close to the Apache Junction/Mesa boarder. Just south of the US60. Major crossroads: Baseline and Guadalupe ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Phoenix Lights are Back!;2005-10-12 20:05:00;3 minutes;Phoenix Lights are Back! I live in Fort McDowell Arizona.  The lights appeared to the south (Over the city of Mesa).  There were 9 amber colored large lights. They were in groups of three.  Each group formed a triangular shape. They did not move during the entire event.  When they finally disappeared they just dimmed out. Tomorrow night I will be waiting outside at the same time...this time I'll have my camcorder. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and he seems quite rational and sincere to us.  Moreover, he has provided high-quality video footage of a similar event, photographed several days later.  We have encouraged him to investigate the incident, to try to explain what the cause of the lights may be.  Generally, the lights are to the south of his location, perhaps somewhere in the vicinity of Gilbert, AZ.  We have corrected the date to 2005.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
All electronics died when aircraft was seen directly above myself.;2008-02-14 00:00:00;20 min;All electronics died when aircraft was seen directly above myself. My girlfriend and i were sitting at my house in Tempe Arizona , and she needed to go home. so i started to drive her home, and when we got to her house she wanted to spend a little more time with me before she went in.  She lives very close to a busy road so you could hear very clearly passing cars,   So we drove around the corner and parked, we were talking for a little while and things got sexual.  And once we were finished it was very hot in the car, so i opened my sun roof and stood up from it, i was enjoying the weather and when i was looking at the stars i saw an object off in the distance that at first glance looked like a street light. I didn't think nothing of it at first but then i saw that it was moving, and as it was moving toward myself, i called to my girlfriend,  Me: baby come up here  her: why Me:  there is something in the sky, i don't know what it is but you have to look at it.  She stands up and looks at it with me, by this time it clearly is moving toward us, once it got over the street there were no more car noises.  And the light was getting bigger and bigger as it approached.  I told her to reach down and grab her cell phone and take a picture of it, but her phone was dead, i told her to grab mine, mine was dead.  Then i told here to grab her camera, but that to was dead. The aircraft arrives over the top of the car and it was absolutely silent, not one decibel of noise was in the air. it floated above us for about 10 min.  Then it started to move away, as it got farther and farther noise started to come back and the electronics turned back on, and started to vibrate a lot.  The aircraft slowly flew off into the distance behind the mountains and disappeared.  The aircraft was about 200 feet above me and orange. i don't know what this is and i need answers. please help me ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

May 25th, 2009 1 00 AM, i was sitting on my balcony. Smoking a cigarette , and talking to my girlfriend.;2009-05-25 02:00:00;hours;May 25th, 2009 1 00 AM, i was sitting on my balcony. Smoking a cigarette , and talking to my girlfriend. i have been staying up all night lately, because i have been seing and Filming Slow Pulsing UFOS for the past week. I believe what i saw may 25th at 2 30 am was one of these same crafts But closer, lower, and brighter. At 1 00 AM, my girlfriend stopped me mid sentence and exclaimed What the heck is that i turned around and there was a tremendously  bright yellowish white light...looked to me at the time that it could be a plane coming Straight at us...{i watch the sky alot and im familiar with planes and what we have in our skys} but as i  watched it i realized, a plane would have moved a bit more by now....this object was barely moving visible to the eye. That was the first thing that raised my suspicion about this light...we watched it hover for a few minutes...and i decided to run and grab my camera... just to get a better look at it...my girlfriend decided to go to bed...i felt compelled to stay up. When i got back outside. the light was no longer white/yellow, But it was Pulsating ALL colors green red blue white purple, {same as the other lights i have filmed} - when zoomed in these lights have a colored aura ive seen the aura double in size and pulse vibrantly...I noted in my log it looked like a contained Aurora borealis Over AZ...I watched this light and filmed it briefly...i noticed this light was pulsing Inteligently...with a pattern so to speak...this is the first time i have observed these pulsations in an intelligent pattern.every 15-20 secconds the light would pulse solidly blue then solidly red. i thaught this was indeed a sign of life connected to this object.after 2 minutes of filming this object i put my camera down...lit a cigarette and just watced it. This was at approximitely 1 30 AM    I watched it for about 30 minutes and at about 2 00am it seemed much closer and much brighter. I decided to take out my camera again. What i saw when i zoomed on this object at 2 00 AM may 25th took my breath away. What before looked like a pulsing sphere was now...a 2 toned sphere of light.by 2 Toned i dont mean.. 2 colors i mean the bottom 2/3 was bright light and the top 1/3 was solid object. when i zoomed on this orb You could see the top 1/3 of the object was dark...or solid,the bottom 2/3 had a Glowing Core of moving light with Red and Blue Lines of light shooting or swimming all around it, like NOTHING i have ever seen on earth. on the video you cannot see this...until i expiremented with color settings i found. sharpening this image and turning contrast down to eliminate any kind of glare you can see what i saw.  here is a link to a clip i posted on you tube    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vp6IEdhCRk&feature=channel_page  this Light hovered slowly Moving twords me for a very long time i went to bed at 5 am because the sun was coming up and the object seemed to be moving Upwards after 4 00 am. it was back near that area -South of the Usery mountain range- May 27th 1am. but not this morning on the 28th.    I WOULD ALSO. like to note the strangest occurance...there is a point... i included it in my Youtube clip where i was about to adjust my camera. i remember my thaught prior i was thinking GOD this light is so amazing i wish i could communicate i thaught that right before i moved my camera....and in my footage ONLY i did not hear this noise... i did not notice it until i watched it the next day. There is a noise....right before the Easily Distinquishable sound of the camera rustling there is A multiple Octave STRANGE ...kind of raspy OTHERWORLDY noise...ive listend to it 100thousand times probably by now and it shakes me to my core everytime  i have no explenation for this whatsoever...and i hope you watch my footage and hear it for yourself;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Bright white light left earth at incredible rate of speed;2009-08-17 02:30:00;8-10 min;Bright white light left earth at incredible rate of speed Sitting on Front porch when we noticed an extremely bright white spherical object come from horizon in the northern Sky. It had a trajectory that took it straight up. The object seemed to leave the earth and proceed straight up at a rate that far,far exceeded the rate of the hundreds of various launches I have witnessed growing up a few miles from kennedy space center. The sky was clear and we watched this object through binoculars for at least 6 to 8 min and could see it in relation to steady stars behind it in the night sky. I was left with the impression that it absolutely left our atmosphere and went into space. Again having witnessed many launches, there is a point when the manmade crafts begin to go down range, as to say you eventually see them moving with the curvature of the earth  I am convinced this object far exceeded the capabilities of any man made craft known to me. It didnt seem to produce any flames or smoke usually associated with liquid or solid rocket fuel used in NASA launches.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Yellowish amber spheres of light seen over the Sonoran desert.;2010-03-24 19:40:00;Less than a minute;Yellowish amber spheres of light seen over the Sonoran desert. On March 3, 2010, at approximately 7:40 pm, I stepped out on the patio to have a cigarette. I was facing south when I stepped through the door and turned to the east to reach for the pack of cigarettes setting on the table. As I was lighting the cigarette I noticed a light in the sky, about a mile away and about a 1,000 feet in the air.  At first glimpse, I thought it was an airplane headed for Sky Harbor, which is about 20 miles to the west of us. My first thought was that it was coming in awfully low. Then a second light appeared and I wondered where this second plane had come from. I had not seen it approach. A moment later, it occurred to me that they were not planes, the color of the lights was wrong. Instead of being white, they were a soft yellowish amber, similar to the street lights around us ( the street lights were not on at this time).  By the time this thought cleared my mind a third light appeared. Then a forth and a fifth. Though they were aligned in a line, it was not a straight line.  Astounded by what I was seeing, I called my daughter-in-law outside to take a look. That is when the lights began to disappear, first one, then the other four according to the order in which they appeared. They did not fade or twinkle out, they simple were gone, as though someone had flipped a light switch.  My daughter-in-law and I watched this sequence of lights appearing and disappearing four more times. So I cannot say if we saw 5 or 25 lights. But I can say that they were individual. They were not connected to each other or a craft of some sort. The sky was clear and still light enough that we could see that there was nothing else in the sky. No planes, helicopters, or any other air craft. There were no kites or balloons either. And I can say without doubt that they were not flares being dropped as there was nothing there to drop them. Just as they were not fireworks being shot off from the ground. There were no tell tale trails of smoke. And there was no sound.  The whole incident took less than a minute, so even if I had the presence of mind to grab a camera, there was no time to take pictures. I immediately reported the event to MUFON. Two hours later a black helicopter appeared flying about half a mile south of us. It flew in from the west (from Luke perhaps) then came north to circle the EXACT spot the lights had appeared in before it flew off to the south.  I learned later from MUFON that these lights were seen 30 miles southeast of us only five minutes after we witnessed them.  I know these lights were not nuts and bolts objects. In fact, I got the distinct impress while watching these lights that they were alive and popping in and out of our dimension. My personal belief is that they were not ETs but Angels.  As I stated before, I did report this event to MUFON. But when I heard you speak on Coast to Coast I thought you should be aware of my sighting as well. And too, I am interested in hearing what you think I saw.   Thank you.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Pulsing bluish-white object seen over NE Mesa AZ;2013-08-03 21:30:00;3 minutes;Pulsing bluish-white object seen over NE Mesa AZ Outside swimming with my Son and Grandson when I looked up and saw a bluish-white circular almost orb looking object.  It almost appeared as if it was blurry or out of focus.  There was one flashing white light circling around the outside of the object.   I asked my Son if he saw the object and he confirmed that he did. We continued to watch the light move through the sky towards the SW.  There was no sound associated with the object.  All of the sudden it was gone.  We got out of the pool to get a better view of the sky in the area that it disappeared thinking maybe it had gone behind a cloud but we were unable to locate it or a cloud in that area of the sky.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
An object which was constantly changing shape moved very slowly across the sky.;2014-03-24 18:00:00;30 minutes;An object which was constantly changing shape moved very slowly across the sky. The object was very dark in color. It was either dark gray or black.  The object seemed to be changing shape rhythmically.  It would go from being a perfect sphere and then flatten out to be an extremely thin disk and then back to a sphere.  It was changing shape constantly while moving across the sky.  It was too high to get any kind of clear picture using my phone.  It was moving in a northward direction for about 15 to 20 minutes and then turned and went west until it was far enough away that I could not see it anymore.  It was never so high that it was in the clouds.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Orange spheres over Mesa.;2014-12-10 20:10:00;15 minutes;Orange spheres over Mesa. Coming home from my daughter's school concert, I noticed two bright orange spheres south of my location  At first, my wife thought that the lights where airplanes, until an airplane passed right in front of them. At this point, we were stumped because the orange spherical lights where bigger than the airplane and a little further south.   We continued south towards the US 60 freeway and the lights were still there,  I got on the freeway heading west and was able to see the lights again however one more light had appeared to the right of one of the spheres making sort of a L shape, at that point I also noticed that they where around the same location as the Mesa Gateway international airport. We continued on to south loop 202 and around Guadalupe Rd the spheres starded to disappear into itself like if someone had pulled a string from the middle and vanished. I dont know what they where but i know they where not planes, and i have my family as witnesses.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Multiple orange spheres over Mesa/Chandler, AZ.;2014-12-10 21:20:00;20 minutes;Multiple orange spheres over Mesa/ Chandler, AZ. After coming home from the store, I noticed a orange sphere on the southwest of my location, I pulled over on the side of the road and parked my car facing west.  Soon after I parked I saw another sphere appear next to the first one I initially saw, I tried recording but my phone kept going out of focus. Around 9:30 I saw a single sphere appear far to the right of the two that i was triying to record,a few seconds later two appeared further right, two more appeared to the left of them and then two more!  All three of the set of two appear to be equally spaced and parralel from each other. I got some blurry video and a picture where all nine can be seen at a distance, unfortunatelly that is all I got, I wish I had a better camera.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Glowing orange light moving in a random way and then disappeared.;2015-01-01 00:30:00;10-15 minutes;Glowing orange light moving in a random way and then disappeared. I saw this same thing earlier in the year but it was 3 lights.  To the south of me I saw one orange sphere glowing brightly almost like it was on fire.   I thought at first it was a firework because it was New Years, but it was slowly coming towards me.  It didn't take a straight path however.  It seemed to randomly move forward.   It was too high to be a helicopter.  I thought maybe a plane and the light was a weird color because of clouds, but it was moving in such an odd manner.   It stopped moving eventually and the Orange light seems to get dimmer until it finally disappeared.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

I took my lunch brake at 2:05pm.  Went to the back of the building and sat down to enjoy some fresh air.  I felt (something) staring at me, looked around and did not see any body.  After a few minutes looked around again but this time I looked around in the sky and there I saw roughly 9-15 white sphere objects moving around.  Not sure how long I was staring in disbelief at what I was seeing. I then knocked on the window and asked for someone to bring me my cellphone so I could take photos of this event.  My daughter brought out my IPhone and we both stood there a few minutes to make sure this was not just debris.  Then I started too snap photos and saw a bigger dark grey object fly in to the area where the spheres were.  Then the store started to get busy and my help was needed.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Low altitude balls over Mesa, AZ, appearing, then disappearing after a short flight in tandem.;2017-06-16 21:00:00;3 minutes;Low altitude balls over Mesa, AZ, appearing, then disappearing after a short flight in tandem. At approximately 9:00PM, I was in my backyard attending to my BBQ.  From the corner of my eye I saw a extremely bright flash that lit up the entire neighborhood.   I looked and thought for a second someone had shot off those massive fireworks.  Two extremely bright red glowing balls of light were now sitting in its place, silent.   As I pulled my phone from my pocket to get a video they started to move together eastbound.  They remained extremely bright red, almost like a hot air balloon.  They move together in tandem at approximately 80 knots at an altitude of 3,000msl.  No position light or anti collision lighting was observed.   As they moved east the one at the rear  disappeared completely.  The one in the leading position continued until it flashed a number of times then disappeared.  The video does not do justice, these objects were  incredibly bright casting a red hue over the ground as they moved.   I am a professional pilot and know just about everything fixed wing and rotor craft display at night.  These were completely silent.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
