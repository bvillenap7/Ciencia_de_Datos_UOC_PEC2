I think I was given a false memory;1995-07-01 02:00:00;?;I think I was given a false memory I went out dancing that night, my mother was watching my 2 kids, was driving east bound on the freeway to go back to her house and pick them up, I saw a semi truck turned over on the opposite side of the freeway with a man lying on the road with his head cracked open, there were a couple cars up ahead of me, no one stopped, neither did I, I kept going, I forgot to tell anyone!!! What is so strange about this is that, the next day my mom asked if anyone had heard the beeping noise. She said that she woke up to a sound like the microwave going off, but no one was up, then the next day I was wearing a tank top and someone asked what the marks were on my back. They were rectangular shapes, 2 of them,not scratches,welts or burns they were marks made by blood drawn to the surface like hickeys in the shape of  hollow rectangles I still forgot to tell anyone what I had seen the night before, and in fact everytime I would remember I would quickly forget again, to this day I have told one person. I can take a lie detector test, theres more to this thats alittle more strange, a little embarrasing,anyhow I would really like to talk to someone to see if anyone else has had these similar markings. I'm the type of person that would stop and help someone if they were hurt or atleast call 911, I think it's weird that I didnt but for the longest time I thought nothing of it.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Mesa, AZ: Helicopter with bright light outside bedroom at 4am.;2001-01-24 04:30:00;unknown;Mesa, AZ: Helicopter with bright light outside bedroom at 4am. My wife and I simultaneously awoke to a loud noise outside our window.  It sounded as if a helicopter was taking off right in our backyard!  My wife sprang up and looked through the blinds, seeing only a bright white light.  She ran through the house to catch a glimpse out the arcadia window, but within a second or two the object had completely vanished, leaving no sound, no light, no trace.  The time was about 4:30am.  We both had trouble going back to sleep.  Just prior to waking I was having a dream that I was floating or bouncing down a long dark street, accompanied by strangers (possibly police officers) and arriving at a house or a window.  The sound I awoke to reminded me of a military helicopter, but why it would be in or just outside our backyard I cannot understand.  A month or two earlier my wife was driving on a fairly desolate road and saw a very fast-moving helicopter with a bright white light coming toward her.  She turned and it vanished quickly.  If you have had any reports of helicopters appearing outside bedroom windows in East Mesa, please let us know.  We are curious to learn what is going on.  Thank you.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
At approximately 10:31 am, Sunday morning, I was outside on our back porch smoking a cigarette when a flight of three Air Force trainer;2001-06-24 10:31:00;3 mins;At approximately 10:31 am, Sunday morning, I was outside on our back porch smoking a cigarette when a flight of three Air Force trainer jets (T3's or T4's? The ones that look like F5's) flew nearly overhead  of my location in East Mesa. Unusual but I've never seen trainers here before. They flew in a tight formation, north to south, at an estimated altitude of 5000 ft, disappearing from view in approx. 2 minutes. Although the speed must have been nearly supersonic, at the capacity of military power(without afterburner) the engine noise was really quiet...less than a Lear jet cruising. Falcon Field airport is a few miles away, I've seen plenty company jets. Williams Gateway airport is a few miles south, and Chandler Municipal Airport a bit south of that...I believe all have radar. As the aircraft diminished to a dot on the southern horizon I noticed what at first I thought was a vulture riding the thermal air currents just to my south, between the jets and my location. We see that all the time out here. My assumption was short lived. What I witnessed behind the trio of trainers I thought to be a large bird in the distance playing in the thermals--a thick, short horizontal line moving back and forth, then in lazy circles, above the clouds then below, behind a tree then behind a house then vertical. The object moved like a balloon on the wind but had the flat appearance of the thicker edge of a matchbook held at about 15 feet. The object vanished into a cloud bank about 90 seconds after the jets faded from view, south of my location, slightly east of the trainer formation. From the time I lit a cigarette and the jets flew over to the end of the sighting was less than the time it took for me to finish my cigarette. There was no metalic reflection, just flat black. The distance was too great to discern shape, but it wasn't a bird, nor conventional aircraft. But it could have been military.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Small satelite object that moved, stopped and faded away.;2002-04-17 20:20:00;1 minute;Small satelite object that moved, stopped and faded away. A very small white light (the size of the planets in the sky right now).  The light started to move from directly overhead, due west to within appx 2 thumbs away from the moon (on the NE side of the moon), then stopped, faded and disappeared.  This was VERY high in the sky, possibly like an orbiting satelite.  However satelites usually don't move, stop and disappear from vision.  No noise, like I said, too far away for any of that.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Sonic booms over Mesa?;2005-05-10 01:40:00;1second-12 min;Sonic booms over Mesa? At around 1:40 AM Mesa time, Aventerra Apartments at Dobson Ranch. My wife and I awoke to what sounded like someone hammerfisting our patio door(It's a sliding glass).  I went outside to invistigate.  No one was to be seen.  At which point, I asked my wife if she would go to the corner store for a beer. Too cool my nerves, and to serve as a nightcap.  Five minutes later I decided to go outside again. I then saw a Mesa police cruiser parked in front of my apartment.  I went around a neighboring apartment as I heard a small crowd.  There I saw a police officer and about seven other people who heard or felt the same boom.  We live underneath a known flight path but nothing like this!  As my wife returns, a second boom was heard to the north-west.  The officer heard this as well and immediately radio'd it in.  As we live next to a police and fire station, a fire-truck was scrambled to see if there was an explosion of some sort in our area.  A police helicopter orbited our complex then searched to the west to see if there was any trouble-there was not. At this point, more people came out claiming they too heard the loud explosion and about 12 mins., later a smaller one as well.  I didn't hear it. Out of pure curiosity I called a local TV station FOX 10 and they said they only knew of a apartment fire 10 miles to the north-east.  I then as a lark, called Luke's AFB and asked if they knew of any supersonic overflights over Mesa.  Maybe a hot-dogger or two.  They said not that they know of, but suggested I call in the morning and file a report with the're OSI division.  I only file this report because maybe this might corroborate a possible ufo sighting as I have seen this activity before-less the fast mover.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

I saw an invisible helicopter;2009-03-31 20:00:00;3 min.;I saw an invisible helicopter I always look upward to the sky to see ufo’s  ( and I do see them often, but don’t usually report them.   We often see/hear police or TV helicopters in this area  I saw some red lights in a row and heard a helicopter but I did not see anything behind the lights.  I ran inside to grab the binoculars and ran back outside and the helicopter (or whatever it was), was invisible.  I live in a metro area and there is usually an outline of something!  I ran to the other side of the house and still could not see anything except the row of red lights and could hear the loudness.  Even if it was jet black, would’t I have been able to see an outline?  I got online to read about invisible helicopters, but could not find much. PS.  I see a lot of daytime sightings and will try to get better at reporting them.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

I saw two red blinking lights, one higher and on a slant, an occasional green light, an occasional blue light, moved in all directions.;2012-03-16 20:00:00;Long;I saw two red blinking lights, one higher and on a slant, an occasional green light, an occasional blue light, moved in all directions. My friend and I were driving from Mesa, AZ back to Tempe, AZ.  My buddy (who is driving, I am in the front seat) randomly notices some strange lights in the sky on the left side in relation to where the car was.  When I turned to look what I saw at first was two red blinking lights one was higher than the other and on a slant from the other as well.  We kept driving for a minute and observing the lights.  Then we start to notice that at first the lights were moving right, and now all of a sudden they were moving left.  At first we thought we were just seeing things, but then at this point the lights were actually close enough to perfectly determine that the object was traveling LEFT RIGHT UP and DOWN.  We are still driving, and this is only about 2 minutes into the sighting (or at least when my friend first realized it)...and now another GREEN light is being omitted.  The green light was only on very briefly as the other two red lights continued to blink.  ! Now my friend and I were 100 percent convinced and immediately pulled the car over to attempt a shot at getting a better video.  Now we are about 10 minutes into the sighting.  When we observed the two blinking red lights from the sidewalk of the street it was clearly evident that the object was moving in all directions as if it was hovering or was in-decisive of where it wanted to go.  This is where my mind was completely blown...there was now a BLUE light as well, which only appeared for a short time just like the green light did earlier.  The two red lights constantly blink'd and seemed to fly in sync with one another although as I mentioned earlier, one was higher and on a slant from the other.  Another note that I'd like to make is that when the other colored lights such as the GREEN and BLUE appeared for their brief moment, a WHITE light was also somewhat evident but not as radiant as the colored lights.  Unfortunately our best video was actually taken in the car whil! e driving, as the lights moved further and further away.  It w! as weird When we were driving it seemed like they were so close to us, and like I said earlier, after little observation...we were like that fucking thing is hovering.  It keeps flying right, then left.  Once we decided to pull over, the lights just got further and further.  We attempted to hop back in the car and chase it for a few minutes until we realized it was a hopeless cause.  Both my friend and I felt though that when it did begin to start moving away quickly, it would make incredible travel time between the blinks of the two red lights.  My friend has the video on his phone.  I'll upload it to youtube as UFO sighting in AZ when I get a chance, or when he does.  Hope you enjoyed what we saw and my description. I have to say I've seem some questionable lights in the sky before such as weird blinking white lights, but never anything like what we saw today.  After today, I'm convinced.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Coming from the South were two perfectly round dull green lights on opposite ends of each other but directly across from each other about the distance of a medium to small size airplanes wing span.  These two lights did NOT blink at all and they were not bright like a conventional aircraft or helicopter as to be used for the purpose of seeing out ahead of where it was going. There were  (zero) no other lights whatsoever on this UFO. As it approached closer towards the highway and right when it got almost directly above me the light on the right side (as Im looking at it coming towards me) turned a reddish color and with the same dim and dull appearance. The craft that was flying was completely dark ,so i couldnt make out the actual shape of it. I thought I seen a quick glimpse of the craft as a other source of low light reflected off of it and It appeared to be like a flat triangle shape. The color ! of the craft was a grayish dull steel appearance with intricate box shaped  or square parts on the exterior located towards the center . I know it sounds like I seen alot but I really didnt and it happened so quick that the only image i have in memory to describe it. The craft also wasnt very high off the ground . It was a few hundred feet in the air . I completely lost sight of it after it flew over my car towards Red Mountain . After that main sighting there were 4 seperate bright super bright lights that hovered out South of Phoenix and North West of Phoenix.  2 each on each side of the 202. There were multiple helicopters flying out between these white lights as well as commercial aircraft coming in and out of Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. The Airplanes and Helicopters are extremely easy to identify whether they are far or near. There was alot of activity in Phoenix at 7pm . I hope others that witnessed what i seen has the inclination to report it as well .. I got footage! of the white lights (4) of them on video on my camera phone. ! I wish I could of captured the dull green lights on the craft that was super close to me, but i wasnt thinking fast enough to get that . that one would even have the Pope believing without a doubt there are UFOs;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
