WE WITNESSED AT FIRST 3 BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE SKY THAT LOOKED LIKE BRIGHT STARS. SINCE IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE SUCH BRIGHT LIGHTS. AS WE CONTINUED TRYING TO FUGURE OUT WHAT THEY WERE 3 MORE APPEARED ACROSS THE SKY. 2 OF THE OBJECTS WHERE MOVING HORIZONTAL FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. AS 2 OF THEM MOVED VERY QUICKLY YOU COULD SEE A TAIL OR TRACER. SEVERAL OF THE OBJECTS LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GETTING CLOSER TO THE EARTH, BUT THEN JUST DISAPEARED. THE OBJECTS WERE VERY CLEARLY VISABLE FROM EVERYONE IN THE POOL AREA. AFTER ABOUT 6-7 MINUTES ALL OBJECTS HAD DISAPPEARED EXCEPT FOR ONE WHICH STOOD STILL IN THE SAME LOCATION FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. I CALLED THE NEWS STATIONS TO SEE IF SOMEONE ELSE HAD REPORTED THE SIGHTING, BUT WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO ONE WHO REPORTED ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE POOL CALLED THE MESA POLICE DEPT. TO REPORT THE SIGHTING.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Flying object seen in Mesa.  ((NUFORC Note:  Confirmed high-altitude research balloon.  PD));2009-05-18 11:45:00;20 minutes;Flying object seen in Mesa I went out on my balcony to have a smoke & saw a bright white light to the northeast of me.  It slowly moved behind a tree out of my sight for about 5 minutes.  I stood up and walked to the other side of my balcony & saw the light again.  It slowly moved to the right, and then up.  After a few seconds it started moving back to the right. very slowly.  Once it had moved to directly in front of me, but it seemed to be a mile or more away from me.  At this point i stepped inside to call my husband outside.  When i did that  it started moving quickly toward me.  By the time my husband made it outside it was a VERY bright white light, almost like a spotlight pointed toward us.  It flew straight toward us and red lights started flashing on both sides of the craft.  It was directly above a shopping center in front of our apartment, i'd say about a football field (maybe that far) in front of us. It turned direction, towards the left (west) and flew silently ahead until it was out of sight.  When it first turned, i could see a row of lights (dim) along the bottom side (almost middle) of the craft.  You could tell it was metallic and it seemed to have what looked like rocket jets shooting orangish light out of them.  They were on both sides of the back of the craft, in between the red lights. The whole time it never made noise.  It was eerily quite for the city.  My husband and I just looked at each other & commented on how strange it was.

Bright red and blue orbs from ufo.  5 ft diameter. I saw a lit object dancing in the air before it glid rapidly over a park.  Looked like a kite with neon red and blue lights.   The object flew very near to me over a brightly lit park, before it sank after flying over the roof of a house, never to be seen again.    Various witnesses saw the kite, drone like object.  Maybe it was a drone?;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
