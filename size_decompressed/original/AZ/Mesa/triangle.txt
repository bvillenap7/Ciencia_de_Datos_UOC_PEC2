When I got out of my car to see what was going on, it left. I was on my way back from delivering a pizza, when I saw a quick flash of light.  I looked out the window because I thought that a plane might have been going down.  I saw two lights about 250 yards away in the sky.  I got out of my car to see what they were.  I still don't know what it was, but it was triangle shaped object with two bright lights towards the front.  It just hovered there, moving slowly forward (towards me).  I was struck with fear, but I couldn't seem to take my eyes off of it.  It seemed to be a black or very dark blue color.  It got within 175 to 150 yards away from me and then it was gone, it went straight up, moving so fast it just seemed to vanish.  I don't know if it was the object or what, but that was the only time I remember any noise, it sounded like a whoosh.  The whole thing lasted about 90 seconds.  I know there are two airforce bases close by, or were then.  I didn't know if it was a new kind of plane or something until it took off.  I called Williams AFB and they said they had no planes flying in that area, and the man on the phone all but laughed when I told him what I saw.  He said that I was making it up, and I should call someone else. I was 22 at the time, married with a daughter, I lived about 10 miles southeast from the location.  I haven't seen anything else close to that before or since the event happend.  I now work as an equipment maintenance technician and live in CA.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
UPDATE TO 2/6/97 MESA, AZ SIGHTING ALREADY POSTED TO NUFORC WEBSITE;1997-02-06 16:45:00;3-4 seconds;UPDATE TO 2/6/97 MESA, AZ SIGHTING ALREADY POSTED TO NUFORC WEBSITE ..THIS REPORT IS TO SERVE AS AN UPDATE TO THE 2/6/97 SIGHTING IN MESA, ARIZONA... Per conversation with the NUFORC, provided here is a link to a g-maps pedometer map of the spot where the 2/6/97 Mesa, AZ sighting took place.  Also provided is an explination of what you will see on the map.  I encourage viewers to open the map in a new window so you may view it and the below explination at the same time. Here is the link to view the map:  http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=1750635  ---------EXPLINATION OF WHAT YOU WILL SEE ON THE AERIAL VIEW MAP---------- In the aerial view we see the Mesa, Arizona apartment complex I lived in.  Notice two red markers, separated by a blue line.  Notice that the indicator to the left (outside the map) states that the distance between the two markers is .0242 KM (or 24.2 meters).  The red marker on the top is approximately where I was as I walked east.  The craft was observed flying east over the train tracks (just outside the complex) after it had flown past the silos (which you will also see in the photo).  In my original report, I estimated the lateral distance between myself and the craft to be 60 meters.  This map has helped me to provide a much more realistic distance (just 24 meters!).  As discussed with the NUFORC, the altitude of the craft could still be estimated at 100-130 meters.  But, the main point of the estimate is that the craft was VERY close and VERY low.  From the point at which the craft was observed, it made a right turn and accelerated to terrific speed as it moved south, and out of sight.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
In Mesa, AZ, I clearly saw a large triangular ship, flying slowly---it turned / flew away at terrific speed.;1997-02-06 16:45:00;3-4 seconds;In Mesa, AZ, I clearly saw a large triangular ship, flying slowly---it turned / flew away at terrific speed. Below is my February 6, 1997 sighting detail, which I also reported to www.ufoevidence.org in November 2005. Appearance / Description of Object(s): The craft was approximately 20 meters in lenth and 10 meters high. I believe it was triangular in shape, but I am not 100% sure. Because it was NOT dark yet, I could very clearly see that this was a flying vehicle, which accelerated at terrific speeds. It appeared lit as it moved south, after accelerating away from me. Size of Object(s): Again, 20 meters long and 10 meters high. With my thumbs tucked behind, my other 8 fingers may have covered it had I held them up. Distance to Object(s) & Altitude: Again, I believe the craft was about 60 meters away, and flying at an altitude of 100-130 meters. Description of Area / Surroundings: Mesa is a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. The complex I lived in lies near an open field, train track and silos (south), at the end of a road that leaves the main road through town. Full Description & Details:  February 6, 1997 was my final day living in Mesa, Arizona.  The next day I moved to San Francisco. Done packing late in the afternoon, I left my apartment and began walking east, on the southern edge of the southernmost parking lot in the complex. I was headed toward the mailboxes to retrieve my mail for the last time.  To my right (south) was a concrete retaining wall that lines the complex.  Behind me, to my right were the large silos, which sit next to the train tracks.  There were no cars or trains passing by. Approximately 500 meters from the mailboxes, I began to hear a low humming noise behind me and to my right (south).   In my peripheral vision, I caught sight of a large triangular craft, the source of the low humming sound. The craft was flying very slowly, at an altitude of approximately 100-130 meters. It was flying over the train tracks, which lie about 60 meters from where I was walking.  At the moment that I turned my head to the right and looked directly at the craft, it stopped, turned right and accelerated to a terrific speed and disappeared.  The craft made NO noise above the low humming I initially heard.  It emitted NO exhaust, fume, smell or fire. It was very much like watching a movie, in real life. Can sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object? NO way.  This was a craft that was being flown by somebody. ANYBODY who saw what I saw would instantly have known that.  The only question I have is, who was flying or controlling the craft?  Humans?  Extra-terrestrials?   Witness Background: I'm a teacher in Brooklyn, New York having recently changed careers from advertising.  I have a masters degree in education.  My undergraduate studies focused on marketing and political science and Arizona State University (1990-94). Views on UFOs, before and after sighting: BEFORE the sighting, I was very open to the possibility that some sightings could be attributed to military tests.  However, I had seen some stories and movies that were compelling with respect to the notion that some UFO's could actually be extra-terrestrial.  Beyond that, I paid no extraordinary attention to the question, mainly because I felt the odds of seeing something inexplicable were very, very low.  AFTER the sighting, I spent nearly a month in denial that it even happened.  Then, on national news, I saw the Phoenix Lights sighting on mainstream national news.  My first response was, That's what I saw.  Then, I was not in denial, but also did not speak much of what I saw except with very close friends.  Within the last year, my curiosity has risen again, though it is very frustrating to imagine that I may never know exactly what I saw.  However, recently I have had very vivid dreams which strongly suggest that what I saw was extra-terrestrial in nature.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Viewed a light yellowish-orange somewhat translucent triangular-shape object with an undulating light.;1997-02-28 23:00:00;30 seconds;Viewed a light yellowish-orange somewhat translucent triangular-shape object with an undulating light. While lying on our picnic table in our backyard watching the sky around 11:00 PM in late February in 1997, my husband and I suddenly sat up when seeing a light yellowish-orange triangular-shape object in the sky moving from north to south.  The object appeared somewhat translucent with an undulating light which changed colors (yellowish, whitish, orangeish) as the light moved in what appeared to be a counter-clockwise direction inside around the margins of the object.  The object looked smooth and rounded with no sharp edges or projections.  We heard no sound and it moved rapidly and quietly through the sky.  We observed it for probably less than 30 seconds.  My husband and I both hold college degrees, traveled extensively around the world, lived in Asia for five years, and never experienced an event like this.   My husband served six years in the military and is familiar with aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
LARGE TRIANGULAR OBJECT WITH 5 DIM AMBER LIGHTS (ONE IN EACH CORNER AND 2 MORE NEAR FRONT) MOVED SLOWLY NW TO S-SW WITH NO NOISE.;1997-03-13 20:40:00;2-3 MINUTES;Summary : LARGE TRIANGULAR OBJECT WITH 5 DIM AMBER LIGHTS (ONE IN EACH CORNER AND 2 MORE NEAR FRONT) MOVED SLOWLY NW TO S-SW WITH NO NOISE. I SAW THE OBJECT AT MESA COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WHERE I AM A STUDENT. THE TIME WAS APPROX. 8:30-8:50 PM (I DIDN'T CHECK THE TIME UNTIL LATER, SO THIS IS AN ESTIMATE) AND I WAS WALKING WEST. I WAS LOOKING AT THE CONSTELLATION ORION (SW) WHEN I NOTICED A CONSTELLATION LIKE TRIANGULAR CLUSTER OF 5 DIM AMBER LIGHTS (NW) OPPOSITE ORION. I  BEGAN TO OBSERVE THIS CLUSTER OF LIGHTS AND QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THEY WERE SLOWLY MOVING (NW TO S-SW) AND THAT THEY WERE PART OF A TRIANGULAR SHAPED OBJECT. THERE WAS A LIGHT IN EACH CORNER AND 2 MORE NEAR THE FRONT, WHICH FORMED A SMALLER TRIANGLE..  *.      .*          .*              .*   .      ..  .*I HEARD NO NOISE. I ASKED ANOTHER PERSON WHO WAS READING THE SCHOOL PAPER IF HE SAW IT, AND HE SAID HE DID AND NOTED THAT THEY WERE MOVING. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN ANY AIRCRAFT AND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ONE. ALSO, I NOTED THAT THER WERE AT LEAST 3 AIRCRAFT IN THE SKY AT THE TIME (2 NORTH AND 1 SOUTH), ALTHOUGH NOT CLOSE TO THE OBJECT. I OBSERVED IT FOR AT LEAST 2-3 MINUTES UNTIL IT WAS NO LONGER VISIBLE IN THE S-SW (IT APPEARED THAT THE LIGHTS DIMMED BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN OBSCURED BY CLOUDS?). IT MOVED IN A SLIGHTLY CURVED, ALMOST STRAIGHT PATH.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Tripod shaped object with red,  blue, and yellow/white flashing lights hovering and or moving over the east valley.;2003-09-14 02:00:00;2 hrs.;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that twinkling stars would be the first possible explanation for some of the objects sighted.  That is surmise on our part.  PD)) Tripod shaped object with red,  blue, and yellow/white flashing lights hovering and or moving over the east valley. While visiting with friends, one stated that he had been observing strangely lighted objects in the sky over the course of the last few weeks (he observed these in Apache Junction aprx. 20 miles East of this sighting). So we went out to take a look and he didnt even need to show me, I saw right away what he was talking about. There were about five with one of them being either larger then the others or just closer. They all eminated from first glance what appeared to be three lighted orbs in a triangular shape and flashing/sometimes sparking off blue red and yellow lights, the red lights seemed to be on the sides(vs. the apex of the structure) It was difficult to make out how many there were because they did resemble a bright star or a planet. But the give away was the red lights on the tips and the fact that they seemed to move around. The important one to talk about it the closer or larger one...this one was off to the right (south east) of the others. It was bizarre, it also had the tripod like shape from the naked eye but when you used binoculars, you couldn't make out a shape, just flashing red blue and yellow/white lights, flashing quickly and it seemed to look like panals of lights, like six panels three on top and three on bottem with no shape in between, but from the naked eye there seemed to be shape that changed sometimes it looked like probes would be circulating around the object it also seemed like there was a hazey white area that would extend out of it like fog or steam but it would be just for an instant...also you couldnt tell if the craft was moving or not and at one time it seemed to be moving quickly towards our direction only a few seconds later to seem evern farther away then it was before, it also seemed to be dipping part of itself in and out of the clouds or the haze that it was producing, at one point the object looked as if it turned on its side and without a doubt I made out two wing like shapes that were very long and pointed they were shaped like long d! iamond shaped swords, they were narrow it made the craft look sort of geese like, but then out of nowhere its shape became enigmatic again. with out a doubt, what we saw was not a natural part of the constellation (i.e. star, planet) we just thought it might be interesting to see if  others had similar sightings and from what we see, it looks like whatever we saw tonight others in the area and south. cal have been also sighting these red blue and yellow white flashing things. well if there is any thing we can do to help let us know. Thanks. Oh our background is, well we are all twenty somethings with 2 of us having B.A. degrees with some grad school classes. I personally am a very overworked and busy single mother of three who trust me doesnt need more drama in her life then what is already present. The things that we saw (they are still there right now, same place) they were definantly strange and not anything that we could explaing through our experiences. We will try to video tape objects tomorrow if they are still around…;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
August 17th 2004 8:25pm Mesa/PHX AZ black triangle object hovering over power lines then moves away.;2004-08-17 20:00:00;5 min;August 17th 2004 8:25pm Mesa/PHX AZ black triangle object hovering over power lines then moves away. I was on my way home from work in Mesa AZ on August 17th 2004 at Approx. 8:25 pm.  I had gone an alternate route home than I usually do because I stopped at a gas station in my area with the lowest price for fuel as my vehicle was low.  Haveing gone this alternate route allowed me to travel on a street that gave me a clear view (Than I otherwise would have had on my normal route home.)of what we in Phx call a green belt which are various strips of land with huge power lines running through town. As I rounded my turn,1 street away from my home, I noticed a  dark/black triangular object seemingly hovering (Extremely low in an area with limited light.)facing west, directly over the power lines.  I was in astonishment and rapidly drove toward the object.  As I approched I rolled my window down as to try and hear engine noise and there was none.  As I came to a stop in the street I observed the object. Moments later Three bright white forward lights turned on along with a red strobe in the center and white strobes on 2 tip sides blinking.  The object Then began to rotate and turn sideways turning north moving off rapidly.  I pursued it as best as I could and observed it turning westward two streets further up.  The object seemed to be mimicking the flight paths of commercial traffic approching westwardly at that time both north and south of the object's position. The object however did not seem to be increasing altitude. It instead followed the same height and flight path (Which would be just south of the Phx airport.)as far as I could track it from my perspective. I then proceeded to observe commercial traffic from the north of Hwy 202 and south of Hwy 60 approching like fireflies in line on thir normal flight paths for a westward approch into the Phx airport.  All the other air traffic altitudes seemed much higher. Later I returned home and related my expirence to friends and family.  I then remembered I still had a phone number for an individual I spoke with over three years ago,who is a member of MUFON and gave me a card. I called him and gave my account of my sighting.  I,however, am not a member of any related group.  I felt that mabey my information could be useful in the event that someone else might have witnessed the same thing.  We talked of details and found it interesting that this occurred on the nite after the new moon, a dark, clear nite sky.  He referred me to this web site to submit a report.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

We pulled up to our house and called my parents out to look at it and then called my brother (we all live on the same street).  the object was in a spinning motion and kept going higher and higher in elevation.  At one point one of the red lights appeared to break off and fall back towards earth and flickered red on the way down.  This happened till all the lights were gone.

Three lights in a triangle dim simultaneously;2005-03-22 00:20:00;20 seconds;Three lights in a triangle dim simultaneously My husband and I were driving north on Lindsey from Baseline in Mesa, AZ when we saw three white lights in perfect formation moving slowly across the sky.  The crafts position made it apparent that it was an equilateral triangle slightly skewed due to its pan/tilt.  The three lights moved across the sky making it obvious that they were joined though the crafts shape was difficult to make out.  The lights dimmed (all in unison), seemed to brighten slightly and then dimmed completely.  By the time we had crossed under the bridge at Highway 60, there was no sign of the craft.  The sighting lasted between 15 and thirty seconds.  Both of us noticed the craft at the same time as it was pretty obvious that these lights were not stars or earth aircraft and the lights were moving slowly west.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Black Triangle glides over the night sky;2006-01-09 20:00:00;3 hours;Black Triangle glides over the night sky A few nights ago my girlfriend and I were driving home from a local store when I happened to look out the side window and noticed a large-sized bright yellow Orb moving fast over the distant highways about 4 or 5 miles away. This was about 7:30 PM. The Orb had been following our vehicle in what appeared to be a straight course to the far left of me but also moving towards us.  I had a strange feeling it was watching us and following us back home.  As we turned some corners and finally getting home I didn't see the light anymore so I thought it was probably just a plane with bright lights, but I decided to go outside and look up at the sky anyway because I had a feeling that it wasn't a plane.  At about 8:00 PM I saw that the Orb had reached the starlit sky where I was standing. It must have followed our vehicle all the way back. What happened during the next three hours are things I don't think can ever be explained. It moved very slow, without any sound at all. Imagine a hang-glider gliding over the sky without a sound, all was quiet. By this time however, the object had drastically dimmed to an eery dark glow and I saw what looked like a perfect black triangle. I could make out the entire outline as if the lights of the moon and stars were reflecting off of it.  The Triangle was very detailed. In fact it looked similar to that recent Triangle UFO posted on this website from Auston, TX. But there were some big differences with the one I saw. There was a red front light on the tip of the Triangle, and two red stationary lights on the two back tips. None of the lights moved or changed. The lights were dim, like those laser-pen lights, and lit up the image of the Triangle. There were no planes around when this was happening.  My backyard was small, and darkened, it was situated in an apartment complex. I stayed there to watch as I didn't want to go out into the open sidewalk. The movement was very strange, it would drift further away, turn around and then go the other way, as if it was rotating in a long, slow circular pattern. It went on like this for about two hours. Sometimes it would fade off in one direction only to appear at another place in the sky.  At one point the Triangle's red tip shot out a faded yellow light beam through the sky. The beam had no movement and reached a far distance. Then the beam would vanish. I decided to walk around the apartments a bit and it seemed like the object would turn its course and follow my direction.  The last hour, the third hour around 11:00 PM, it was in the middle of the sky and did the strangest thing, it shot out a small white orb from the side. The orb slowly went a ways then changing its course flew back inside the Triangle. I had no idea what it was doing but that is what happened! The orb looked like one of the stars but it had no sparkling effect like a star does. Eventually the Triangle drifted off through the sky I don't know where it went from there, but I could no longer see it. Whatever that thing was, I know for sure that it was no plane...;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

When the daylight was disappearing, they faded seemed as if they were a reflection with the sunlight.  I pointed it out to my neighbor and he witnessed the lights.

This craft was silent,It had red lights about 8 of them and looked like a giant boomerang black in color.  It was moving slow probably about 100 knots.I would guess the altitude was 7-10000 feet.  It was headed west,I ran in to get my digital camera but it was no longer visible.  More people must have seen this, especially some of the airplane pilots coming in to land.

I looked up and could clearly see a V formation of lights all moving together, the light the moon was giving up gave enough light that I could clearly see the craft was in the shape of a triangle not a boomerang. I am not good at judging altitudes but I will assume it was high because we could not hear a thing. it zipped over out heads and as it turn the lights level out and we could tell it was turning and by that time it completely disappear. It did not shoot up or just keep going it turned and tilted up and was gone. i went for my phone instantly to get a video but by the time it load up the craft had disappear.  I am a firm believer in what I see because i can rationalize what I am seeing and what I saw in the sky last night was something I can rationalize in my own mind. nor could my friend who po! inted it out first.  It would have flown right over our heads and if he did not see it it would have been gone and we would have never known it was there it moved so fast and was completely silent.  williams field air force base is about 5 miles south of my dads but this was not military there is no way we have crafts like what i clearly saw last night. i will tell any one who asks me if i believe we are not alone that we aren't in this universe something is out there from yesterday on my life will forever be changed after this.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

Appeared round from the ground, but unusually bright. Upon observation through binoculars it appeared more diamond shaped.;2013-09-02 18:35:00;35 minutes;appeared round from the ground, but unusually bright. Upon observation through binoculars it appeared more diamond shaped. When I was traveling along a freeway on 09/02/13 at approximately 18:35 p.m. I saw a unusually bright light in the north sky from Mesa, Arizona.  I made mention of it to my wife who also noticed it's unusual luminiosity.  Since I have been a night shift worker for 21 years I am used to looking up in the night sky and noticing anything that seems out of place.  As we drove along I notices that the object was above the clouds, since as we traveled some high clouds would come in between the object and us.  I thought this unusual since balloons up that high would hardly be visual.  Since that area in the sky is in the normal route of commercial aircraft arriving to land at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, AZ, I thought it unusual that this object was much higher than the descending aircraft who were approaching to land (and below the cloud level).  When we reached our destination in Mesa, AZ at 18:55 we immediately requested some binoculars from the home of my my father! -in-law to observe it more closely.  He complied.  When I looked at it in the binoculars the object seems to have a diamond shape.  It appeared to have lighting from within itself. The object did not appear to be moving at all, just hovering.  I, my wife and several members of her family observed it through the binoculars for several minutes. One member of the family thought it was a hot air balloon due to it's shape, but observing it myself I could not detect any flickering from the typical flame that normally occurs in the ascent and descent of a hot air balloon.  I observed a flight of an airplane that passed by but I have no reliable experience as to whether it was close at all (the same altitude, etc) to the observed object.  I did notice people in other cars at stop lights observing the same thing from their cars, it was that noticeable.....;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

3 fiery colored lights in line that did not flicker, but eventually dimmed, grew bright, then dimmed and zoomed off quickly one-by-one.;2015-07-11 20:45:00;10 minutes;3 fiery colored lights in a line that did not flicker, but eventually dimmed, grew bright, then dimmed and zoomed off quickly one-by-one. 3 fiery-colored lights in slightly bent line formation.  Appeared to be triangular in shape, and did not flicker, stayed in same spot for several minutes until the top one dimmed, grew brighter, then dimmed again completely and began to take off at an alarming speed.  Once flying away, it flashed subtly between red and blue, but there were no plane wing lights.  Over the next ~5 minutes, the other 2 did the exact same.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Triangle craft moved slowly and deliberately over the area, was very low, and clearly visible after thunder storm.;2015-09-03 20:45:00;10 seconds;Triangle craft moved slowly and deliberately over the area, was very low, and clearly visible after thunder storm. Triangular craft, 7 lights total, each corner one large white light, with a small white light between each corner.   Large orange-red light in the center.  Caught the light out of the corner of my eye, looked up to my left (southwest facing yard).  Craft was moving very slowly westward, had enough time to get a full view of it, turned my head for a second and it disappeared.   Was much lower than a plane, lower than cloud cover.   Made no sounds but was not trying to hide.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Very low, large, fast traveling lights that just disappeared quickly with no clouds in the sky.

There were 3 lights in a triangle shape.   I grabbed my friend because I thought a big, passenger plane may have been crashing.  Then it just was gone.   We both saw it.  Neither of us can truly explain it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source provides not information about sighting.  PD));33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Triangular shape object flying overhead maybe 50 feet was seen.;2016-03-18 20:20:00;25 seconds;Triangular shape object flying overhead maybe 50 feet was seen. While attending a LDS/Mormon Easter Pageant last Friday evening at the Mesa Temple in Mesa, AZ... approximately 20mins after 8pm, while there was a break in the play.  Just for a second in relaxing while I was looking up to the stars, noticing a half-faced moon (facing south-west) I noticed during the event/show there were airplane learjets flying from south to north-western pattern which would fly directly over my head say every 50 secs.  This was a bother at times when I'm trying to enjoy the show as these jets were only a few hundred feet above me.  So as I looked up one time I noticed a triangular shaped craft as I took aim with my eyes for a closer examination.  I noticed there was at least 2 circular shapes within this triangle... it was not lit up internally but the shape of this was illuminated from the street lights (Main street which was to my right) and the surrounding lights.  This shape was say 40 to 50 feet above me it seemed like and was taking a! northern flight path.  It seemed to be the speed of like a quad-copter or drone which my first thought was that someone probably is currently flying a drone because it would make a great camera/video of the event that night but after I was examining this object as it hovered slowly at the same altitude there were several brief moments in the play/show where there were no sounds so I had a good listen to the surrounding area while it was flying overhead and I noticed no sound coming from this craft.  After further thought I ruled out it was any quad copter/drone because something that size would be quite loud enough for me and others to hear it's props/engine.  I was asked by my family later when I told them what I saw why I didn't catch their attention when I saw it first but this whole experience took maybe 20-25 secs was all so I was recording this experience and taking in all of my senses in to determine what it was exactly.  Besides, if I would have told them about it and to look up, etc...  I would have missed more of the details! of what I saw.  In another detail of this craft I was prompted to remember the framing of this triangle/object I saw as it had thick bars outlining this triangle... almost thinking it was from an Erector set, haha, but again I saw no evidence of it being owned by people or could be bought in any Hobby store... as there were no sounds coming from it when all around me was quiet for a few seconds.  I following watching this object and even cupping my forehead and face to block other lights around me and it flew a northern path until I couldn't see it anymore as it flew into the darkness.  So it either flew at a higher altitude or flew away so far that the current surrounding lights that I was seeing it could not lite it up anymore. This experience prompted me to submit this post as I couldn't find any other UFO sighting/records around the area/valley with this same experience and description. Thank you for your attention.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
