Yellowish/orange sphere seen by Wife and Myself.;2012-01-15 18:00:00;4 minutes +;Yellowish/orange sphere seen by Wife and Myself. At 18:00 on Sunday, Jan. 15th 2012 the wife and I were Driving East on Baseline Road towards Ellsworth Road. In the Sky were 8 lights, all of them a Yellow color. They were in a formation that resembled the little dipper upside down.  The Dipper of the formation was up.  As soon as I pointed the lights out to the wife they Dipper portion of the formation turned in a clockwise rotation.  The ships in the Handle then started to get smaller. It looked as if they went higher into the air and then were gone. Then the ships left in the Square formation started to do the same thing. At this time I was able to get my phone out and activate the camera. I was only able to snap two pictures. All but one light had left. At this time another light came up from the east. It stopped and hovered with the one remaining light. This light then disappeared the same way as the others. Leaving one remaining light, this one also disappeared as the others however upon disappearing i! t did seems to cork screw or barrel roll before getting too small to see. Other than the last light come up, please note that all other lights were hovering.  They were only moving slightly in the sky. Image 1. Shows one ship just hovering, this is the last light to remain. Image 2. Shows two ships hovering, this contains the above light and the newest one that came from the east.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917

And walk around the corner and looked up behind the house and saw orange glowing light moving slow west to east then changed to.   The southeast few sparks fade out but still could see it and looked like three engines were at the bottom. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Rectangular object with no lights or sound heading from south to north over mesa night sky;2015-05-12 00:15:00;10 seconds;Rectangular object with no lights or sound heading from south to north over Mesa night sky We were laying watching the night sky for shooting stars when I noticed what at first seemed to be a ground spotlight in the sky.  I pointed it out to the other person,  we both realized it was not a spotlight within seconds.  It came from the south going to the north.  It looked rectangular and seemed to have tan on the underneath.  Almost like many tan things flying in formation or like a parachute.  It was going too fast to be birds or a parachute and it was just after midnight. It made absolutely no noise and had no lights on it.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
Black Rectangular Flying Object Over Mesa, AZ.  ((anonymous report));2018-05-29 19:45:00;5 minutes;Black Rectangular Flying Object Over Mesa, AZ. As I watched the sun set and planes making their way to Sky Harbor airport, I noticed a black, square aircraft almost directly overhead.  It was much further away compared to the planes heading to the airport.  And it didn’t move much.  Watching for a few minutes, I saw that when it did move, it was slow and bobbing.  This was potentially a balloon or drone.  But it would have to be jet sized or bigger, judging by the planes for reference. The craft was too far away to take a meaningful picture.  It was just too small.  But I ran inside to get some binoculars just in case they would help show some detail.  I came back outside less than 60 seconds later, and it was gone without a trace.  Nothing in the sky either above, or on the horizon.  It was far too slow to have moved completely over the horizon or up out of sight in less than a minute. After a brief search, I’d say the closest similar sighting is one recorded in McAllen, Texas, on Dec 6th 2014.

He at first thought it was a flag flying, when we realized it was some kind of flying vehicle. I got out my phone and took a picture and a short video. My husband handed me his phone to get better quality photos but unfortunately, the vehicle had already dipped below the horizon. We are still wondering what we saw exactly.;33.4042976958524;-111.737329953917
