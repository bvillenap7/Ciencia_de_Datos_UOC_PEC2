3 objects flying in all directions at high rate of speed;2008-07-19 11:23:00;36 minutes;3 objects flying in all directions at high rate of speed Husband went outside and caught movement in the sky. Called me out and pointed out the objects.They were going in circles, zig-zag, up, down, left and right all at a high rate of speed.There were also different colored lights we could see, green,red,blue and yellow. When our room-mate got home we pointed them out to her, she saw them also. We stood, then sat and watched them for about 32 minutes then they got dim in the sky and got smaller and smaller and then they were gone. We went into the house and discussed it for a long time.;35.0313;-112.5441
