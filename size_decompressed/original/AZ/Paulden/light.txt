7 white lights South of Paulden, AZ.  On 6/8/17 at 9:45 pm, that lasted until 10 pm.;2017-06-08 21:45:00;15 minutes;7 white lights South of Paulden, AZ.  On 6/8/17 at 9:45 pm, that lasted until 10 pm. Last night, on Thursday night, at approximately 9:45 pm until 10:00 pm, 6/8/17, my neighbor and I were sitting on my front porch, enjoying the clear cool evening.   We noticed some strange lights to the South South East of our area fairly low in the horizon.  At first we noticed four white lights moving slowly up and down separately from each other and within about 2 minutes the number had increased to seven.  This lasted about 15 minutes.  The lights looked to all be individual and moved slowly in an up and down pattern as well in opposite directions.  They also got brighter and dimmer, as the event was happening.  The lights appeared to be about 20 to 25 miles in the distance, and looked to be over the Prescott Valley to Dewey cities, from our position in Paulden.  After about 15 minutes the lights started moving in a southwesterly direction, and slowly vanished from our view.  I did take a couple of photos with my cell phone camera  and I will try to forward with the report.   I would like to know if anyone else had seen these as well?  This appeared to be a similar situation from what I have heard and seen of the Phoenix lights years back.;35.0313;-112.5441

I also contacted my parents who live about 4 miles East of me and they also saw the lights.  I called my neighbor that was with me last week and he also saw them this time as well.  We noticed some strange lights to the South South East of our area fairly low in the horizon.   At first we noticed Eight white lights moving slowly up and down separately from each other and within about 1 minute the number had increased to Ten.  This lasted about 10 minutes.  The lights looked to all be individual and moved slowly in an up and down pattern as well in opposite directions.  They also got brighter and dimmer as the event was happening.   The lights appeared to be about 20 to 25 miles in the distance and looked to be over the Prescott Valley to Dewey cities from our position in Paulden.  This was very similar to my report from last week exce! pt the lights appeared to be getting bright to dim much faster.  At approximately 10:05 the lights started to fade and headed in a Southerly  direction and slowly vanished from our view.  I did take a couple of photos with my cell phone camera and I will try to forward with the report.    I am a bit more skeptical about whether or not  this could have been some sort of a military operation since it was so similar to what I saw last week?  Although the white lights had no sign of navigational green or red lights that one would expect of aircraft.;35.0313;-112.5441
