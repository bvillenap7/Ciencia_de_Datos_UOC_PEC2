I, my wife and family were driving home as we  looked ahead where we make a turn either a left or right because the street ends at that point. Beyond this street is  vacant land and a clear view of the open sky where we can see plenty of stars on a clear sky. Tonight my wife and I witnessed something we have never seen before in our lives. In the sky was a very bright round shaped object which continued to change colors from red to green to orange. From its left side and then bottom it shot out about half a dozen orange yellow colored objects which were small at first and then grew larger and suddenly vanished. The second set was about a dozen of the same objects which again glowing, first small and then grew larger and suddenly vanished.  The incident appeared to have resembled blowing bubbles where at first they appear to be stuck together and then find their own shape as circles and then take off like the speed of sound. The object continues to remain in the sky as I write this letter. The object gets brighter and then returns to a stable strobe of green orange and red lights.  From Queen Creek the object appears to be over the ASU Polytechnic Campus. Observers background is US Marine Veteran and Retail Manager;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
quiet jet and red orb flying low over San Tan Valley, Az at midnight. The orb wasn't attached to anything.;2011-04-16 23:55:00;5 min;quiet jet and red orb flying low over San Tan Valley, Az at midnight. The orb wasn't attached to anything. I was watching television Sat nite 4-16-11 when I heard a very low flying jet getting closer.   went out in my back yard and looked up just as a jet, at only a few thousand feet, had passed my house traveling in a northerly direction.  ( Mesa Gateway airport,   formerly Williams Air Force Base, is about 10 miles from here to the northwest ) Flying along with the jet was a red orb.   My first thoughts were that this was the Anatov 225 (biggest plane in the world) sneaking into the airport to refuel without attracting attention with the red lite being on the craft that generally flys with it. I realized almost immediately that this could not be the case since the plane wasn’t nearly big enough to be the an 225 and the red orb was not attached to anything.  As I watched these continue north, the orb moved to the left of the jet, then  seemed to backtrack toward me.  I say “seemed to” because for a moment it appeared much larger than  when I first saw it as if it was! closer to me.  Thinking about this last night (4-18) it almost seemed, in retrospect, that the orb was aware of my presence and was checking me out.  It then  retreated back closer to the jet after this and after a few miles the jet banked to the west with the orb disappearing in a westerly direction over the rooftops.  The only sound heard was the relatively quiet jet engines and nothing else.  The only lights on the plane were a dim white light at the tip of each wing.( I couldn’t really see the plane due to the darkness but had the wings been visible the lites would’ve have been on the tips)  No landing lites, no strobes, just the dim lites above,  If you put my address in Google Earth you’ll see that my house is at the back of the development.  The plane and orb were traveling just inside the back edge of the development toward the north at a very low altitude.  Others in the neighborhood heard the plane also and were very surprised at the low altitude, though I was the only one to go outside and look.  It almost seemed that both objects were trying to get to where they were going while attracting as little attention as possible.  I’ve never seen a plane flying that low over these  houses, let alone at midnight on a Saturday!  I have no doubt that something out of the ordinary was going on.  The orb reminded me of one that I saw 2 nights running (Aug 8 & 9 in  2009 except that was very high up in the sky.  That orb was reported on this site, as well as Mufon and ATS.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Orange glowing balls.  Flicker on and off. Huge in size. Moved great distance in seconds.;2014-01-07 19:55:00;2 minutes;Orange glowing balls. Flicker on and off.  Huge in size.  Moved great distance in seconds. My entire family saw these large, orange, balls of light in the sky. I saw the first two very near each other just to the west of my home.  I thought they were two planes in formation, but then they appeared to split/evolve (Shot out of the other???) into two to three more identical objects.  The remaining lights were partially obscured by the clouds, but not the first two.  They cast light into the clouds just around them.  They seemed to light up and then go off as they moved southeast.  They moved a large distance very quickly.  They would light up in one location and then jump to another, farther distance away.  The whole family saw them.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062

Orange ball of light across sky.;2015-12-22 20:28:00;2 minutes;Orange ball of light across sky. From the witnesses backyard, noticed a bright orange ball of light traveling east to west across the sky.  Object was initially under the cloud ceiling, which was 4,600 feet at the time of event.   Size of object appeared to represent a size similar to that of a single large aircraft light.  No other lights present in the area.  The color remained a bright orange with edges that seemingly danced like a flame would.   Object maintained an even altitude and one witness confirms it was not a flare.   Said witness is a former Air Force technician with sixteen plus years of experience.  Other witness is an aviation enthusiast.   The length of the event was roughly two minutes and the light eventually disappeared behind cloud cover in the western sky.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Large lights slowly moving, dimming in and out of visability.  Abrupt angle changing motions, morphing.;2017-04-05 18:00:00;1 hour;Large lights slowly moving, diming in and out of visability. Abrupt angle changing motions, morphing. Want to start off by saying I have never seen this much activity in the sky over San Tan Valley.  I've seen a few things I couldn't explain in the past over this horizon.  Went in my backyard to feed dogs and I looked up in the sky like I always do.  Saw a bright red star in distance, which I thought was a plane heading straight at me. It got bigger as it approached then stopped in the sky.  It hovered over the San Tan Mountains for a while, then directly under it to the right another white light appeared.  Slowly drifted north.  Then another similar light appeared and did the same.  For a while the three lights formed an Isosceles triangle.  The two white lights drifted toward Chandler/Gilbert area and when they got over the populated area started to flicker like that of an airplane.  But not constant like a planes lights flashing.  The white lights started to flicker a lot and dipped under the horizon out of sight. The red star stayed still drifting upward slightly.  What I thought was a plane headed towards the red light, then stopped and completely changed directions and drifted upward.  Couldn't believe what I saw.  The red light then started to fade away but not until a bright white orb appeared under it, pulsated, shifted direction and disappeared.  Before the circus ended a smaller red orb drifted up to the red star and almost kissed it before changing directions and fading away.  Also when all this activity was happening I saw three aircraft in the sky fly by.  One flew almost directly over my house.  Had a big green light under it and I couldn't tell if it was a plane or a helicopter.  Made almost no sound at all. The other two flew directly under an orb but must not have seen it.  This sighting left me with an uncontrollable gut wrenching feeling in my stomach.  Too much activity for no one else to witness.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
