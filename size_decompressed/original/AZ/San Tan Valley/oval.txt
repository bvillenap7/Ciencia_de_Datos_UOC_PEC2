Red glowing oval/bell shaped object moves very quickly across sky and then slows down.;2013-12-22 02:30:00;3-5 minutes;Red glowing oval/bell shaped object moves very quickly across sky and then slows down Around 2:30 am on Dec. 22, 2013, our dog started barking and wanted to go out.  I opened the door and walked out with him to make sure there was on one in the greenway behind our house that he might bark at.   I first noticed a large red light just peeking over the rooftops of the houses southwest of my location.  We have a lot of air traffic so this is not uncommon, however that low altitude is.  I quickly scanned from left to right the greenway and when I looked back the object had moved at least half the distance from where I first saw it and my location. It now had my full attention.  After almost coming to a complete stop, it suddenly shoots from left to right (east to west) covering a distance of 1,500-2,000 feet (this is hard to report as I could not tell how far away it was) in less than 3 seconds and gained altitude. This distance could have been further.  We see tons of aircraft come from that direction and everyone of them we see from that distance takes at least 3-5 minutes before they reach the house.  Once it reached this new location just south of us, it came almost to a stop and slowly cruised east to west until it flew out of sight. There was no sound at all. The object, upon seeing its profile and at a much slower speed, revealed to my wife and I a bell shaped object in which the mouth of the bell was stretched out making it look like a huge plate with the bell sitting in the middle of it.  Its shape was not that detailed though as it emitted a bright red glow making those edges described very rounded (think somewhat oval but with a very pronounced center rising up).  The color remained red, but the center, and tallest part, started glowing white, then red, and then orange.  The object just slowly crept away heading west.  This last leg was the bulk of time we viewed it.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Single oval object blinking red and white light. Making loops over the Arizona desert near Coolidge, AZ;2014-11-05 04:50:00;20 minutes;Single oval object blinking red and white light. Making loops over the Arizona desert near Coolidge, AZ On 11-05-14 at approximately 0450 hours, I awoke to let the dogs outside in the backyard. It was a still night with no wind and a full moon.  I immediately observed a single oval shaped object emitting blinking lights that changed color from red to white and back to red.  The object could be seen between two mountain peaks from the San Tan mountain range which is on the Gila River Indian Reservation land.  The object appeared to hover over the City of Coolidge, but its actual size could not be determined for certain. I watched the object for 10 minutes as it moved quickly up and down and side to side very quickly. I woke my wife up and we both watched it another 10 minutes together as it stayed between the mountain peaks.  No sound could be heard during the 20 minute observation. I called the Coolidge Police Department later in the morning and they had no reports from citizens or calls for service about the object.  It is unknown what it was.   I tried to video record the object on my cell phone, but it was too dark and too far away to be recognizable. I have lived in the desert my entire life and have never seen anything like this before.  It was not a helicopter, airplane or balloon.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062

They were flying South at a good rate of speed, equidistant from ea other.  There was no sound whatsoever coming from these objects.  They were about 10,000 ft high.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
