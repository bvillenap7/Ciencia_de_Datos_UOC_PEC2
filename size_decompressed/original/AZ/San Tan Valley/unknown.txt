Extremely loud rubbling heard and felt, like rocket launching 20  feet from you;2012-03-18 15:00:00;3 minutes;extremely loud rubbling heard and felt, like rocket launching 20  feet from you This was not a U.F.O. because nothing was actually seen but in the middle of the afternoon I had let the dogs out in the backyard and while standing outside all of a sudden there was a sound like a rocket taking off next to you.  The noise was so loud you could feel the rumble on your chest. Also hearing the noise from inside my brother runs out the door and the first words out of his mouth are is this the apocalypse.  The weirdest part of the whole thing is that it was the middle of the day and being able to see clear in all directions, there was nothing in the sky at all. This did sound alot like a jet but about a thousands times louder.  Unlike anything I have every experienced.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
20 star like objects traveling NE one by one over San Tan Valley az  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-25 19:50:00;15 minutes;20 star like objects traveling NE one by one over San Tan Valley az I walked outside into my back yard and looked up at the stars as usual. I saw one moving star traveling in a NE direction. As I watched the first one another one came into view heading in the same direction. One by one  my son and I saw one after another fly overhead in the same NE direction. About every 30 seconds or so. There was at one point two together close one right behind the other moving at exactly the same speed and direction. I had my binoculars and could only identify them as looking like moving stars. Heard no noise. There may have been more going overhead before I went outside but we counted twenty. They were high up perhaps like the height of high flying commercial planes.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
