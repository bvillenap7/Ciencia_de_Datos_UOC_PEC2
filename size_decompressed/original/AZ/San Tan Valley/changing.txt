Streaks of light ahead of red object.;2017-05-16 18:45:00;10 minutes;Streaks of light ahead of red object. I was standing outside with my wife when we witnessed several red lights traveling from North to South while appearing to shoot out a trail ahead.  This happened 4 times before the objects disappeared.  There was no sound or smell with these.  Each of these appeared equidistant apart.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062

Th;2019-02-19 20:00:00;20+ minutes;Travelling south in San Tan valley, AZ, I saw 5 lights low in the western sky.  3 were linear and 2 were cross/star shaped and bright.  The linear lights were fading in and out to the point it was hard to see them, one of the star shaped faded out to a bright linear and the biggest star stayed for about 10 minutes before turning into a bright linear, brighter than the others.  After about 15 minutes only 4 were visible, one traveling south (the direction I was headed and followed the same direction.  I should note that there were two airplanes in the sky as well, both traveling toward it but turned around and headed the opposite way as it got closer to the 5 lights.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Significant number of objects seen interacting with each other, visible to the southwest of San Tan Valley, az;2020-07-11 00:30:00;several hours;Significant number of objects seen interacting with each other, visible to the southwest of San Tan Valley, az Walked outside and saw a significant number of lights on the southern horizon that were made up of both moving and stationary objects, all of which were emitting changing color lights. Much activity occurred... several formations of 3-4 crafts appeared to be working in harmony.  Light beams were visible between several crafts within each of the formations.  My husband (nuclear plant manager) and myself (consultant) were joined by my neighbor who is the wife of a Phoenix police officer and we watched them for several hours.  At one point we used a laser pointer and pointed at the crafts (they were clearly not airplanes) and within about 10 minutes of this activity they completely disappeared from the sky.  Many of them had been engaged in erratic movements and coordinated movements within their groups.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Multiple crafts moving independently as well as in formation visible to the southwest.;2020-07-15 00:32:00;several hours;Multiple crafts moving independently as well as in formation visible to the southwest. Similar to several nights prior, multiple craft are visible to the southwest with two visible a bit to the north.  Multi colored lights and very sudden / fast movements visible from 5 crafts.  Three of the crafts appear to be working together and at times a light between one and another (like a line) is visible for a fraction of a second.  This was observed by myself and my husband.  I am a senior executive for a consulting company and my husband is a retired nuclear plant manager.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
