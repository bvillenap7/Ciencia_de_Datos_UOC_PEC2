White Triangle object seen in San Tan Valley, AZ faded as sun set.;2013-09-02 18:50:00;25 minutes;White Triangle object seen in San Tan Valley, AZ faded as sun set I was driving home from work, and I noticed that there was a bright white light, almost like a star to the North.  The sun was still up and bright, so I knew it was not a start.  I live near an airport, and I figured it was just a plane. As I kept driving, I noticed that it wasn't moving, flashing, or doing anything.  It also looked to be in a triangle shape, with the point down.  It appeared to be a long distance up in the sky, so it is hard to tell.  I snapped a picture on my phone just to see if I could enhance it, and it's just a little dot.  After arriving home, it was still in the sky, so I grabbed my camera and took a picture.  I was able to zoom in enough to see that it was, in fact, a triangle.  It had not moved since I first saw it, and did not move while I was writing up most of this report.  The sun set, and the light started to fade, almost as if it were reflecting an object, not emitting light.  It eventually completely disappeared into the dark sky.  It was at roughly 20ยบ into the sky directly North, almost where the star Polaris would be.  (I figured that a star would get brighter, not darker as the sun set.);33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
My wife took dog outside and saw several orb like lights flying in different patterns.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-23 21:00:00;2 seconds;My wife took dog outside and saw several orb like lights flying in different patterns. She called me outside to show me what she was seeing.  As we continued looking up, a large triangular craft with extremely bright white light seemed to materialize over us and flew forward at a very high speed.  It disappeared as fast as it materialized.  Absolutely was not a shooting star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Wasnt moving at all, hovering in the air.  As we drove away we watched it, and it started flying away super fast, within 3 seconds the lights were gone;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
