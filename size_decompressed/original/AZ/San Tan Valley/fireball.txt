One large fireball dropping 3-4 smaller fireballs into the AZ sky;2013-09-21 19:30:00;15 minutes;One large fireball dropping 3-4 smaller fireballs into the AZ sky I was riding my bike going east along the Western Canal and in the southeastern sky (above San Tan Valley, AZ?) I saw a large fireball in the sky which I thought was a comet.  Then, the large fireball dropped 3-4 smaller fireballs.  The larger craft kept flying forward as the smaller fireballs dropped toward the earth.  I tried to Google info about it when I got home but I havenâ€™t found any other info about it yet.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Red orbs over San Tan Valley.;2013-12-24 18:25:00;30 minutes;Red orbs over San Tan Valley. At 625 pm I noticed a abnormally bright orb of light to my left side of hunt hwy hovering in place.  shortly after I see two red orbs one a leader the other following the same pattern ascend slowly for about 2 minutes then gain massive speed while traveling upward and out of sight.  At 650 pm I again see about 5 red orbs this time in a triangle formation flying over san tan valley by Bella vista rd.  They fly for about 1 minute in this pattern then break off one by one gaining massive speed and traveling upward.  One of the orbs had sparks emitting from it as it traveled upward but the others did not.  No sound from any of the orbs but I took video of both times with camera phone.

4 glowing orbs.;2014-01-07 21:56:00;10 seconds;4 glowing orbs Looked to the East and seen 4 yellow/orange glowing balls in a straight line hovering over Florance area.  They illuminated the clouds behind them.  One to the left would fade out then another would appear to the right of the other three.  Then they all faded out at the same time.  I noticed a small aircraft flew past when I first noticed them.  They we're about the size of golf balls from where I was standing and much larger than the aircraft.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Red ball of hovering light.;2017-01-01 00:20:00;5 minutes;Red ball of hovering light. As I was watching fireworks last night I saw a bright red orb light fly then hover in the sky last night.  At a distance it looked like a plane or helicopter.   There are many planes as we are in the flight path of Mesa Gateway Airport.  It flew from a far distance from the south then stopped and hovered above me.  It was a bright red silent light and I could not see behind the light.   It was hovering so close I went in to get my high powered flashlight to shine it to see what it was.  Before I could shine, it took off west to the night sky almost as it had predicted I had a light. I presumed or was a drone but when it flew off it was much too high, too fast and flew too far away to be a home drone.  An hour later I could hear fighter jets to the norteast.  We also have plenty of them fly over so the sound is familiar.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
