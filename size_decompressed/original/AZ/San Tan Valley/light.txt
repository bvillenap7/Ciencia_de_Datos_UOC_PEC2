I specifically recall a grey touching my forehead with one long skinny finger to put me back under?;1997-03-15 01:00:00;5 hrs;I specifically recall a grey touching my forehead with one long skinny finger to put me back under?   March 1997  Approx one month after moving into new mobile home in Chandler, AZ. I was having a very disturbing and extremely realistic bad dream in the dream I was sleeping and woke up to commotion and light in my bedroom the light did not come from any lamp or light source that I had in the room it was like a flooding light not that bright but illuminated the whole room from what I remember I saw three small thin short aliens the exact kind we call the GREYS one was next to my husbands head one at the foot of the bed and when I went to sit up in bed I turned to my side and there was one right next to me by the headboard of the bed as I went to sit up the grey took his long skinny index finger (3 fingers and a thumb) and touched me very lightly on the forehead right between the eyes and the next thing I remember I woke up sat straight up in bed full of adrenaline really freaked out.  I pulled open the curtain and through the blinds saw that the sun was barely rising. I thought to myself I have only been asleep for about 5 hours. I am so unbelievably thirsty but if I get up and go get a drink I wont be able to go back to sleep.  I am going to feel like crap if I can’t get a few more hours but my mouth was so dry when I tried to swallow I hadn’t any saliva and gagged. With The adrenaline rush and the thirst I rolled off my high pedestal waterbed and when I tried to stand my knees buckled. I became extremely weak I felt like I had hiked a mountain lifted weights and been beaten and in a car accident all at the same time.  My whole body was sore. My muscles were aching legs weak head felt so heavy I actually felt drugged. Sort of how you would feel after having outpatient surgery where you get anesthesia and an hour later you are woken up and ready to go home. I pulled myself together and walked to the kitchen.  I never drink tap water but this time I grabbed a kid’s cup and went to the sink.  As it was filling I looked out the window that was over the sink and saw my 6month old kitten sitting on the hood of the neighbors car across the yard looking at me. I remember gasping and almost choking because I hadn’t drank yet when I saw her.  I thought damn there must be a hole under one of the cabinets to the outside or something.  She was an indoor cat and never had been outside and she was in bed with me when I fell asleep that prior evening. I quickly drank the water and went to the door which was locked (both locks) unlocked it opened it. I gasped again because the scrunchie hair-tie that I ALWAYS wore in my long hair to bed so my hair stays out of my face was on the front porch step. I ran out grabbed the cat and went back to my bedroom feeling very bewildered and confused. My thoughts immediately went back to my dream. My husband got out of bed and got dressed and left for work he was going in earlier than usual since we were awake 3 hours early. I didn’t tell him anything other than I had a bad dream. I didn’t want to sound crazy. As soon as he was gone I called my mom in Illinois to tell her about the dream and how real it seemed when it comes to paranormal and metaphysical things she is very open-minded. I told her how I woke-up found the cat the hair tie etc. and I expected her to say something like oh honey you just had a bad dream or maybe I was sleepwalking (which I have never done). But what she told me instead of something comforting and reassuring was a story that thoroughly freaks me out and yet sounds so familiar. According to my mother Sharon lee mowatt-hardwick in the summer/fall 1975 my grandparents ken and Ethel mowatt were on their way to las Vegas to go gamble like they did every so often. Somewhere between the Arizona border and Vegas my grandfather saw a very bright light that seemed to be following them.  He was positive it wasn’t Venus as they were in the mountains and the horizon where Venus rises and sets wasn’t visible. The light followed for so long that he decided to pull the car off the road to see if it was a helicopter would pass over them and my grandmother had wanted her sweater, which was in the trunk of the car Granddaddy told my mom when he got out of the car he saw the light getting really close and really bright but he was puzzled as there was absolutely no sound whatsoever coming from what he assumed to be a helicopter. As the light was right over them another thing he noticed was the lack of the blinking lights that every plane helicopter aircraft are required to have just the one steady white round bright spotlight. The next thing my grandfather says he recalls is the fact that when he blinked his eyes it was suddenly daylight my grandma who had been inside the car was standing right next to him wearing the sweater he had never gotten out of the trunk inside out. They looked at each other dumbfounded got into the car and proceeded to Vegas When they arrived at the motel the desk clerk immediately informed them that they were almost 6 hours late for check-in and our family and the Highway Patrol had been looking for them fearing an accident. Over the next month they both started having dreams and flashbacks. Granddaddies were of seeing Mum on an exam table surrounded by 4 grays and they were doing something to her breast. He attempted to sit up from a laying position and a grey placed his 4-fingered hand flat on granddaddy’s chest and that’s it. Mum just had dreams of being examined by children. Granddaddy died on Christmas Eve 1984 of lung and esophageal cancer when the chest x-rays were given to my grandma the clouded mass of cancer in his chest was in the exact shape of a small hand. Mum passed in ’92 of breast cancer and she had a mastectomy done prior to her death where a small long thin piece of metal was removed from her breast tissue and analyzed. The lab could not identify what is was or was made of they gave it to my mom in a small glass vial and my mom doesn’t remember what happened to it. I recently moved to the country and I feel like I’m losing my sanity and I also found a lump in my forearm no scar went to dr. and they said to leave it alone?? My issue is the grey touched Mums breast and granddaddy’s chest and I specifically recall a grey touching my forehead with one long skinny finger to put me back under?;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Multi colored star bounces in the sky like a fly trying to get out of a window;2012-04-30 20:43:00;90+ minutes;Multi colored star bounces in the sky like a fly trying to get out of a window Monday, April 30th, 2012 around 8:40 pm I let the dog out to use the facilities before heading for bed.  It was such a beautiful night that I decided to sit in a patio chair and watch the stars.  I looked up and saw the Big Dipper and at the end of the 2 stars that are part of the tail, there was what appeared to be another star but it was much brighter and had beautiful colors of blue, green red and yellow.  I thought that it was a plane but the planes flew right by it.   What was interesting about this object is that it was stationary at first then it would bounce around like a fly in a window pane trying to get out, or someone walking with a flash light in the distance.  This went on for more than an hour and finally I ended up having to go to bed so that I could go to work the next day.  This object seemed to be much higher than aircraft could fly.  I attempted to take pictures, but my phone camera wasn’t able to catch it.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Bright white light hovering in southern Arizona night sky;2013-11-11 17:00:00;2-3 hours;Bright white light hovering in southern Arizona night sky On November 5th, 2013, I saw a bright white light to the south.  It was around 5pm, dusk with a few scattered clouds (a storm was coming in).  The light had a haze about it and I thought it was a really bright star at first or an airplane.  So I watched it for a 3-4 more minutes to see if it was a plane.  But it began to move erratically, it's behavior nothing like that of a plane nor star.  It appeared to be hovering, bobbing up and down.  Then it would fly up to the left, hover then float back down farther to the right. (distance was hard to tell, though it appeared to be far, but at the same time it almost seemed like it was right above the San Tan Mountains.)  After witnessing the strange behavior, I went inside to get out my astronomy binoculars, ruling out a plane, star or satellite.  Looking through the binoculars showed me the object was spherical, with bright gold lights encompassing the entire object and the lights appeared to be moving clockwise, which I suppose suggests the object was rotating, revolving as it hovered.  We would periodically check on the light every 30 minutes or so and still no change.  At around 8pm the object (while viewed from the astronomy binoculars) appeared to turn towards the south and fly off.  The light became dimmer and smaller until it completely disappeared.  Thinking that was strange and still not knowing what it could be, I dismissed it as nothing, perhaps the military or the coming storm was responsible.  But, I have now seen this object in the sky every night around the same time.  I am really curious as to what this could be.  The behavior is always the same, always in the same spot and staying there for 2-3 hours.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062

Three bright orange lites in succession in semi-circle repeate in southerly direction.;2014-01-07 20:00:00;10 seconds;Three bright orange lites in succession in semi-circle repeate in southerly direction. Looking to the East over desert and saw bright orange light that flashed on then off and on three times in a large semi-circle, then repeated 3 lights on and off, then flashes at same intensity behind a cloud, all progressively further south.  There was no smoke visible around lights.   There were also no planes in the area.   Didn't look like any fireworks I've ever seen.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Blue, green, red lights sail over San Tan Valley.;2014-03-23 20:30:00;30 seconds;Blue, Green, Red Lights Sail Over San Tan Valley. Three lights.  One blue, one green, one red. Flying West to East in a line equally spaced apart.  No sound at all.   After about 15 seconds of moving toward the East, the lights slowly stopped.  The red and green light got very close together, while the blue light stayed where it was.  Then all three slowly faded out. My dog stopped immediately and looked at the lights.  He never pays any attention to planes that fly over.   Could not see any object that the lights were attached to.  No outline of a plane or other aircraft.  They seemed to be flying pretty low for a normal airplane as well.  We live right in the flight path for Gateway airport, and other planes seemed to be flying around these lights like they weren't even there.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Huge bright object just above mountain peak.;2014-08-31 18:25:00;5 minutes;Huge bright object just above mountain peak. My wife and I were driving East on Empire Rd, when we saw a huge white object just above the peak of the ridge of the southern extent of the Superstitions (Tonto Nat'l Forest) maybe 20 miles away.   Looked through binoculars and the light appeared starlike and very large. To my knowledge there is nothing up there that would cause a reflection like that. After turning a corner and getting back in sight of peak again, object was gone.   I have a clear view of that peak from my patio and have never seen that light before, so I do believe it was something other than a reflection.   Also it wasn't moving, so unlikely to have been a plane's landing light.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062

After a very short time, they turned off and we’re both gone.   As soon as I could (within several minutes), I grabbed my binocs and looked in the area but saw nothing. About 15 minutes later I saw a plane fly into the area where the object(s) was and flew around there for, at least, 10 minutes, before flying off in the direction it had come from.   The orbs were quite similar in appearance to a sighting I had several weeks ago in the SE sky.;33.1933649484536;-111.533913402062
Possible UFO.  ((anonymous report);2017-12-11 19:30:00;35 seconds;Possible UFO Three bright oval lights, white in color observed in the sky's north of San Tan Valley, AZ.  At first one bright light was seen as it was stationary and stayed bright for 5 to 7 seconds.  Then it went out and two more lights lite up as the third light lite came back on.   All three lights same brightness, as they went dark they seemed to, in a faster then normal, sped to another location in the sky to the north east of San Tan Valley, AZ, and again would light back up and stay stationary for about 10 to 15 seconds.   After about 35 seconds all lights went off and nothing was seen again. In the past month I have seen this same action one time before with the difference of there being only one light.
