UFO's or not;1989-06-30 21:30:00;1 min;UFO's or not I had been on my frontporch and I noticed what appeared to be a bright green meteor coming down at a angle.  It seemed to be coming from the South east. I did note that there seemed to be something unusual about it. I kept watching and called for my wife to come out to see it.  While I kept watching I noticed that it seemed to be getting close to a treeline in the distance.   Suddenly, it flipped totally around and that was when I noticed it was triangular in shape.  The broad end of it flared bright red and it shot almost straight up into the sky.  My wife had just missed seeing it. Last month of this year we are in the same town but a different house.   I witnessed on two seperate occasions a bright object moving almost deliberately but smoothly across the sky. I did not see any blinking or recognition lights.  The object would then arc upwards out of sight.  One I saw had been traveling east-north-east.  The other one had been going east-south-east.  My younger brother on the other side of town had also witnessed these craft and also noted the direction of travel as well. He also has a some photographs of some kind of disturbance in the sky.  In one instance, upon closer inspection you can almost make out a triangular shape in the middle of it.  It almost reminds me of the description of the aura given in the tale of the Philadelphia experiment.  My brother had a source tell him that it appears to be the new kind of camoflage being used by military aircraft.  If so, then it just may be using something similar to electro-magnetic fields to make it work.  He said the images were not visible or noticeable until he got the pictures back.  They are on the negatives.  The camera he used was a 35 mm. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));32.9562;-111.5299

Date 10/24/2014, Friday  Time: 8:00 – 10:00 p.m.;2014-10-24 20:00:00;2 hours;Date 10/24/2014, Friday  Time: 8:00 – 10:00 p.m. The sighting happened while driving home from Casa Grande, AZ, to Coolidge along a dark county farm land road. UFO sighting was seen in a light formation in the sky above the Pima Native American - Gila Indian Reservation, and Sacaton, Arizona. No sound. There was a haze around the dark triangular object. the object emitted 30 plus small lights underneath it in a formation, pulsating and moving very quickly in a straight line up and down and sideways Aerodynamically unlike any airplane, moving with impossible moves and speed.  There were beams of light that occasionally pointed downward lasting a few seconds. Witnessed by my son and I. 14 additional people or witnesses saw the UFO. The large triangle UFO edges were barely visible but there were many lights darting beneath and around it. The lights on the edge pulsated from top to bottom, one at a time. We have numerous photographs.  (Contact me if you'd like to see the images)  It was more view-able or bright using peripheral vision.;32.9562;-111.5299
