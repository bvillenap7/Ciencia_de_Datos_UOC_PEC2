I saw some lights in the sky and he thought they were lights on signal peak. I pointed out that they were very huge and yellow colored. They almost looked like the flares that the military shoot off for their night drills.They showed no movement, there was no smoke trailing from them, and the ground did not appear to be lit up from them. WE kept watch up until we got in to town. Sometimes we could see them from his house on the edge of town. Other times they would be gone. Occasionally one light would fade away or the object turned. Unsure if all lights were on one object or were actually three objects. We were watching them before they were on the news. The lights mostly just seemed to hover. Did not observe them leaving the area, so unsure as to the capability of speed or manuvers. Have seen many objects in the past make very fast sharp turns that known aircraft are not supposed to make. This pa!rticular sighting, the object  seemed to be either in a wedge formation or triangular shaped.From five miles out of town the lights appeared larger than than the street lights we could see in town.Once in town they appeared to be as big as a basketball. My co-worker and I both work for the Dept. of ((Name deleted)).;32.9562;-111.5299

As it got closer the fog grew into a massive ball shape, while the light got brighter.  No other clouds were in the sky. Then the light disappeared and the fog dissipated leaving behind a glowing blue light in sky that lasted for 5 minutes or more. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));32.9562;-111.5299
