Bright orange light traveling North-West.;1999-08-07 23:45:00;5 mins;Bright orange light traveling North-West. My wife and I had just gone to bed at about 11:45 P.M.  Within a few minutes my mother rushed in and knocked on our bedroom door.  She said there was a large orange light outside and to come look.  She had gone outside to try to find Saturn with binoculars when she saw the light.  When I got outside,  I saw it almost direcly overhead, slightly South of my house.  It was moving slowly towards the North-West,  and looked like a single,  very bright orange light.  I looked through the binoculars and could see that it was actually several lights.  It looked like it was wedge shaped on the leading edge,  with some more lights behind the wedge,  perhaps a total of 10-12 lights.  I only looked through the binoculars for a second or two and immediately went in to get the camcorder.  Unfortunately,  the recorded image was poor, and I ran out of tape after only about 30 seconds.  I never got to see it again to get more detail,  my last sighting was through the camera.  It appeared to head off about 10-15 miles from the house,  at which time lights started dropping from the object.  It faded from view shortly after that.  The total time it was visible was at most 5 minutes.  Both my wife, and my mother said they could see some structure above the lights when they viewed it in the binoculars.  They said it looked like it was some sort of fabric material,  similar to a balloon.  There was no basket under it, and it never made a sound or the typical glow of a hot air balloon.  None of us thought it could be a hot air balloon,  but maybe some other type of balloon such as a weather balloon.  Altho I don't know why it would have the lights on it that we all saw or why it would have been launched so late at night.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
Burning Light above ridge of Mingus Mountain;2012-01-14 23:30:00;10 mins +;Burning Light above ridge of Mingus Mountain I was driving north from Robert Market in Prescott valley toward Roberts Rd.  The time was around 11.30 -11.45 pm on Saturday the 14th of January 2012.   My eye sight was drawn toward the ridge on Mingus Mountains.  I saw an extremely large light being admitted from above the ridge of Mingus mountain, the light has a soft orange glow to it becoming more white as it disbursed (the size of the light appeared to cover a few miles) the light allowed the ridge to be visible and also lite up the sky and clouds, similar to the sun setting, although not as intense.  I believed at first it to be a large wildfire, but looking closer the light was well above the ridge, the area of light was large and the view was incredibly beautiful.   I continued to watch for around 5 mins before continuing my journey I lost sight of the light when traveling up Hondo as the ridge was no longer visible, but was still able to see the reflection of the light in the clouds of the dark dead o! f night sky.  I was expecting to hear of a fire and after nothing has appeared in the new I called the forest dept to ask if anything of that nature had been reported, I was informed that no fires, or prescribed burns have taken place in that area. Did anyone else see the light?  Does anyone know what it was?;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171

Blinking object over Mingus Mountains.;2014-07-04 21:00:00;21:30;Blinking object over Mingus Mountains I was viewing the Mountain Valley Park fire works from my backyard in P.V.  Off into the distance in the Mingus Mountains, I spotted a blinking light.  (Not real fast)  This light changed from Red to White.  It also appeared to toss in the color Blue/Green at times.  I watched this light make incredible moves up and down and 45° to arched 90° angles.  This movement was also relatively fast.   Instead of watching the fireworks I spent my time involved with this light.  I did get my camera out and tried to record this.  All I can see is a BLACK screen!!!  But.... It seems that I DID capture a tiny, tiny blinking light towards the lower left part of my screen.  Again.... This is TINY!   This light moved a bit off and on… But, for the most part just stayed still. (Besides those larger movements above.)   The craziest part was when it left the sky!!!  This object went DIRECTLY DOWN STRAIGHT.  I could no longer see it.  The Mingus Mountains were the backgr! ound.  Never seen such a strange site in the night sky before.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171

We immediately observed what looked like two very large stars some distance apart high over the town toward Glassford Hill.  The two white lights were blinking in an alternate regularly-spaced pattern.  A moment later the lights moved closer together, still blinking, one on, the other off, then vice-versa, like a railroad crossing signal, only bright white. We could not tell if this was two separate objects or lights on one craft.  All helicopters I've ever seen at night had flashing red lights.  These were big, bright white lights alternating in a precisely timed sequence. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Multi-light UFO hovers N of Prescott Valley, AZ, for a couple of hours.;2018-08-31 22:20:00;2.5 hours;Multi-light UFO hovers N of Prescott Valley, AZ, for a couple of hours. My friend and I were sitting out back, facing east.  The moon had come up over the mountain about 10 minutes previous.  My friend looked north and said, What's that?  Low on the horizon was a moving light. I told him it was a plane (Prescott Airport is behind our location, so they are not uncommon).  He said not that one, and pointed to a light above the rooftops in the distance. As we watched, it seemed to bob and drift slightly like someone's hobby drone.  I managed to get and extreme zoom steady picture (which had to be greatly enlarged on my pc).  It appeared to have 6 red lights and 2 blue/green.  It seemed to be changing colors, but it was a distance.  On one photo where I moved, it appears as a multicolored streak, showing the different colors. Thinking it was someone's drone, I forgot about it.  A couple of hours later I went out to look at the stars before going to bed.  It was still there, just higher in the sky. I sent photos to a professor at Embry Riddle Aeronautic University in Prescott.  I knew that they had a UAV program.  He eventually got back to me and said no body there claims it. I just figured it was military.  Watching Hanger One made me think of reporting it. I sent photos to the local paper to see if anyone else saw it.  They just called to verify I sent them.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
