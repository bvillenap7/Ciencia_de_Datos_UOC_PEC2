My husband had told me of a UFO sighting he had seen but I wasn't sure whether to believe him or not. A few days later, at approximately 06:00 hours on February 22, 2000, My husband was leaving for work.   All of the sudden, he darted back into the house and told me I had to come look. I saw two cylinder shaped objects, rotating in a circular motion at the top only, with orange X-shaped lights on the base of each one.  They were traveling about 20 m.p.h. northeast across Prescott Valley, towards Mingus Mountain. We could only see the X-shapes with binoculars and I also grabbed the camera to take pictures, but they only captured a single orange light for each object. One at a time,the objects eventually dissappeared out of sight as they neared a mountain full of low lying clouds. My husband 35,is a machinist, and I, 35, am a secretary.  Two of our three children, 15 and 10, also witnessed the sighting, and were as excited as we were.  None of us ever would have believed in a UFO until now...EVER. would have believed;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
Flying Coke can figures that were rotating at the top with the shape of X lights at the bottoms.;2000-02-22 06:00:00;10 minutes;Flying Coke can figures that were rotating at the top with the shape of X lights at the bottoms. I woke up at around 6:00 a.m. hearing my mom and dad exchanging words that had the content of camera and binoculars.  I got up and went outside in the drizzle and looked up, and I saw two objects that seemed to be very large.  They glowed near the top and on the bottom were orangish fiery color lights in the shape of a big X.  They moved to the northeast and at a distance, seemed to gain more speed and then they flickered away. ((NUFORC Note:  Excellent graphic rendition received from witness's mother for this sighting.));34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171

They were in the shape of a cylinder with lights in the bottom that formed an x. When I was leaving for work at 06:00 I saw two orange glowing objects in the sky.  They appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away and about 200 feet off the ground.  I am a commercial pilot and flight instructor and can judge altitude and speed well.  they were in the shape of a cylinder much like a soda pop can.  I judged them to be about 15 to 20 feet in height and 10 feet in diameter.  The bottom had lights on it in the shape of an x.  The bottom stayed stationary while the top oscillated in a circle.  It was moving at about 10 miles per hour at first, but as it got higher, it,s speed increased.  It climed to an altitude of about 1500 feet above ground level and a speed of about 40 to50 miles per hour.  I watched it through my 10 power binoculars for about 10 minutes.  Finally one disappeared and then about a minute afterwards the other one disappeared from sight.  It was very cloudy and could have gone into the clouds.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
Long, cylindrical shape, at near sunset, disappearing behind mountains.;2012-02-04 18:15:00;2 minutes;Long, cylindrical shape, at near sunset, disappearing behind mountains. I was looking out my bedroom window, at the mountains to the west (Glassford Hill) around 6:15 PM tonight.  I saw an object, cylndrical in shape, but with a bump in the middle.  I called my brother in to look, and he saw it too.  The object appeared from my perspective to be moving downward, at an angle, until it disappeared from view behind the mountain.   It was dark in color, and no lights were visible on it.  The mountains are about ten miles away.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
