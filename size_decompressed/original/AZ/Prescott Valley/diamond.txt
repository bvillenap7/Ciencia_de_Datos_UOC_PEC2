Large, hovering star like object.;2020-07-30 20:00:00;45 minutes;Large, hovering star like object. My four-year-old son and I were walking along a dirt path near our home in Prescott Valley AZ.  The sun was set but there was still some light in the sky.  Only one visible star at this point.   I heard a helicopter flying low, so I pointed it out and we watched it fly just above us.  Then I noticed above its flight path this large object in the sky. It was brightly shining, silvery, white and could be mistaken for a star but was way too large and had a slight diamond shape with rounded edges.  A bright light surrounded the object making it difficult to make out the exact shape.  At arms-length I could cover the object with a nickel. It was just sitting there.  No movement.  For about five minutes, it just hovered in one spot.  No sound was ever heard. A woman walked by with her dog. I said to her, Do you see that thing?  What do you think it is?  She said, I don't know, but I see it!  It hovered for about five more minutes then began to rise and kept rising until it had to of been way out of our atmosphere.  As it rose the sky became darker and both my son and I could see three lights flashing along the center of the object.  They were yellowish.  My son and I watched it for close to an hour until it was a tiny speck and I could no longer point it out from the stars.  From my point of view, I could not tell how large this object was, how high in the sky it was, or how fast it was going. I have never seen a UFO before nor thought I ever would.  I waited a few days to try to find information online on what it could have been (possibly a high-altitude weather balloon) or if anyone else saw it.  I cannot find information on this object.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
