Observed yell/gold slightly out of round orb floating below treetop level less than 50 ft. from me, unobstructed view, silent, observed;1997-02-15 20:00:00;35-40min;Observed yell/gold slightly out of round orb floating below treetop level less than 50 ft. from me, unobstructed view, silent, observed approx 35-40 min. I am a 51 yr. old disabled man, that was employed by the AZ. Department of Corrections. I have a pretty good eye for details.  In Feb. of 1997, I was in my backyard having a cigarette at approx. 8 p.m. when I glanced toward my neighbors yard, I clearly observed what appeared to be a slightly out of round, yellowish/gold orb floating (best way to describe it) below the treetop level of the tree in their yard. I was quite excited about having the experience and refused to yell out to my wife (at the time) for fear of causing anything to disrupt the event.  I would estimate the object to be about15 ft. tall and nearly the same wide but not quite.  It was completely silent, appeared to be smooth in texture with no appendages or apparent windows or doors.  It was not brightly lit but rather more glowed than anything else.  It remained clearly in my sight without motion for 15-20 minutes.  I swear I could hit it with a stone for it was only about 50 ft. from me.  I think it was between 30-50 ft off the ground.  When it did move it was extremely slow and silent.  I observed it for approximately 30 minutes as it sort of drifted southward toward Phoenix, until I could no longer see it. I immediately went inside and told my wife who was more than a little irritated at me for not calling her out. I am an avid believer in the existance of ufo's.  I am not a flake. I could care less if anyone believes this for I know what I saw and that is all that matters to me. My phone number is unlisted so please use discretion.  I do not need to speak to an investigator but am willing to discuss the event with anyone who may think such a conversation would be helpful.

In Arizona-A light attached to something floating.;1997-12-14 23:30:00;30 minutes;Summary : In Arizona-A light attached to something floating. A friend and myself were comming over the Mingus Mountains to Prescott Valley when my friend who was driving the car slowed down very quickly and pointed out what appered to be a large bunch of baloons that had what appeared to be a string attached and a flourescent green light.  We video taped the object assuming that it was a weather baloon but not quite sure.  Over approximately a 30 minute time period we always had the object in sight but kept relocating in order to video tape it more clearly.  At times the flourescent green appeared to be a video monitor or computer screen, reassuring us that it was probably a weat;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171

3 then up to 6 white flashing lights move erratically all over-N. Prescott Valley, AZ 10/22&10/23/13 PM;2013-10-22 18:30:00;2 1/2 hours;3 then up to 6 white flashing lights move erratically all over-N. Prescott Valley, AZ 10/22 & 10/23/13 PM. Looking North I saw 3 flashing lights.  Would appear far from each other then w/in a sec 4 to 5 to 6 lights would show up very close together.   I did call 12 News in Phoenix and spoke w/ a Paul Martinez, but he had said, sorry can't help u with what you're seeing, sorry, bye. (So I was very annoyed by that, cause who else would i contact at the news if not calling their main line, right?!?!) You would think he'd ask for what I was seeing, the direction, etc, just like previous people have done in the past here.   So anyways, after calling it did look like 3 jets scrambled to the direction east that I said it was going where we lived, (not knowing why and they were loud) but not moving as fast as I saw the first 3-6 very odd looking lights blinking, which the jets didn't have the same pulsing or blinking of the lights I had seen w/ the previous that just flown by moments earlier.   Then w/in an hour I saw again moving east to west this time the same white ! flashing lights moving erratically go from 3 lights, then to 4, 5, and then 6 flashing lights w/ no noise. They went as far West as I could see over the mountains towards Prescott, AZ.   Then they'd go north to south north to south for about 3 min but it looked like north to south was like 1-2 miles from where I was.  They weren't moving faster than I've seen jets before move and would move around up down side to side.  Then back my way 15-20 miles, maybe even 30 miles from my balcony within a blink of an eye without any noises being heard.  I've also have seen this same thing tonight, Wed, Oct 23, 2013, as well.   Please, if anyone has seen this as well, post something!;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
I saw two bright orange lights in the night that slowly glowed on , then slowly glowed off.;2016-08-22 22:15:00;8 seconds;I saw two bright orange lights in the night that slowly glowed on , then slowly glowed off. It looked like a really bright star, or a stationary plane in sky, but it was orange.  When I stepped outside at night, it was already there in the western sky.  Then another bright, similar light appeared just to the upper left of it.  It was the way that they appeared and disappeared that was odd.  They glowed on and off really slowly.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
