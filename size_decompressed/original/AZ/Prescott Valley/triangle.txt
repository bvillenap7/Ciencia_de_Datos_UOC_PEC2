Are the Phoenix Lights returning? Local sighting near Prescott Valley, AZ  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably military flares.  PD));2007-02-06 21:00:00;10 minutes;Are the Phoenix Lights returning? Local sighting near Prescott Valley, Arziona suggests mysterious orbs may be coming back! On February 5, 2007 at around 9:00 p.m. MST I was in the passenger seat of a car heading south on Highway 69 from Prescott Valley,AZ towards Dewey, AZ .  To the south (looking towards Phoenix, Arizona) I noticed three lights equally separated in a triangular shape, hovering just above a local mountain range.  I quickly recognized these lights as resembling the largely talked about Phoenix Lights above Phoenix, Arizona spotted 10 years ago on March 13, 1997. I quickly pointed them out to my friend (who is a very well-respected woman who works in one of the local school districts) who was driving the car and she agreed that these lights were very out of the ordinary. I watched the lights start to quickly spread apart, one orb heading east, one heading west, and one heading north. My view was then disrupted by a hill on the side of the road for about 5-10 seconds. When we finally passed by the hill, the three orbs had disappeared into the night sky leaving me in a state of awe. ((NUFORC Note:  Because of both the location, and nature, of the bright objects, we strongly suspect that the bright objects may have been aerial flares, launched from aircraft over the Barry M. Goldwater Firing Range, located near Gila Bend, AZ.  That is what official military sources apparently reported, shortly after the event had occurred, and we have no reason to doubt that claim.
