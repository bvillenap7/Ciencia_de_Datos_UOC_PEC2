During this time I felt like something was watching me when I was watching the object.;2011-08-28 23:20:00;20 minutes;During this time I felt like something was watching me when I was watching the object. I went out at 11:20 pm to let my dog out when I looked up in the sky and notice an object in  the east with red and green lights very bright.  I put the dog back into the house and stayed out there watching this object.  The lights would fade in and out then you would see tiny white lights flickering on and off then they would change to green and white colors.  Then I would see and oval shape to it then it went back to round.  I watched this for 20 minutes then the lights just went away and I came back into my house.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
Oval object with white blinking rotating lights. After 30 seconds it veered and vanished.;2020-02-17 21:55:00;30 seconds;Oval object with white blinking rotating lights. After 30 seconds it veered and vanished. I was sitting in living room watching a movie. Our front door has a window at top. I noticed bright flashing coming through the window. I ran out front door and saw a bright object in western sky-seemed perhaps a mile or two out over the prairie. We live north of Prescott Valley on edge of prairie terrain.  The object was oval, or circular in shape.  There were white lights blinking and moving in circle around object.  Object was much larger than normal airplane size-about twice-or three times size of what would be considered an airplane in night sky.  Object veered to left, or southwest and just suddenly vanished.  Night sky was quite clear with a few thin drifting clouds.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
