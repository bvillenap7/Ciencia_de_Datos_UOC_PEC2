Changed color all at once & disappeared all at once. Four of us were leaving a restaurant after dinner when we noticed four bright, yellowish-colored lights, much brighter than the surrounding stars, appeared just east of Glassford Hill. We watched them for a couple of minutes before the restaurant help noticed us pointing at the sky and came out to see what was going on. There were between 9 to 10 of us viewing these lights. We were at the south end of Glassford Hill and the objects appeared to be about a mile from us between 1000-3000' high - it was hard to judge. An airplane on the way to Prescott Airport flew just west of and below the objects and they appeared to be much higher than the plane. There was no sound and no apparent movement at first. They appeared as if they were hugh, yellow stars. Then they started moving somewhat like a helicopter would move. Their formation at first consisted of three objects forming a triangle and a 4th off to the side (see Diagram 1). Then the 4th object moved to the bottom and off to one side (see Diagram 2). The remaining three objects then formed a vertical, perfectly straight line (see Diagram 3), moving very slowly. The 4th object remained in its position the whole time. All at once they changed color from yellowish to a dull orange all at the same time. One of the three objects then moved up towards the middle object and almost touched it & remained there for a few seconds before resuming its original position (see Diagram 4). The three objects then formed a straight line again and once more one of the three come up to meet another, almost touching again. We have never seen anthing come that close together without a collision. Finally, all four of them made a horizontal, perfectly straight line and then disappeared all at once (see Diagram 5). We could not detect any shape to the objects or lights on them. They appeared, as stated before, to just be hugh, bright, yellow stars, except that they moved & made various formations. Two of the observers own a business in Prescott Valley. Another observer is employed by them as a salesman and is a former police officer from Phoenix. The fourth observer is a department manager of a local store. We do not know the backgrounds of the restaurant personnel. We will be sending a copy of an official map indicating our position at the time of the sighting.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171

Object turned due south towards Phoenix then became two objects. Object on the left passed over and to the right of the right object.  Then became one. As object traveled further south it began to fade in and out 'til it dissapeared over the horizon. Commercial heavy aircraft passed to the right of the object traveling N.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171

My wife, Mother, Step-Son, Sister and myself observed 4 objects N of our home moving NNW and N. One large, bright object on the Left seperate from 3 smaller objects on the right close together in a straight line. Three smaller objects moved faster than the larger object. The far right smaller object turned NNE at a faster speed than the middle object which turned due north. The three smaller objects became further apart 'til the center object picked up speed and was closer to the horizon than the other three. The large object on the left and the three smaller objects formed a perfect V formation 'til they dissapeared over the horizon.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171

We saw four firey round objects floating in the sky, North Easterly direction, watch them about 15 minutes until they disappeared.;2000-03-03 20:00:00;15 min;We saw four firey round objects floating in the sky, North Easterly direction, watch them about 15 minutes until they disappeared. Around 8:00 p.m. again, at the same restaurant, we were getting out of the car, and noticed three firey looking round objects, floating in an upright V formation heading in a north eastern direction. There was no sound or smoke. All of a sudden we watched a fourth object shoot up from the ground, to the same altitude as the other three, but never joined them. It stayed by itself but yet moved in the same direction as the other three until they all disappeared. My kids and I watched them for about 15 minutes, during which time, several employees of the restaurant had joined us in watching the objects. They told me that they have seen these lights several times before.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171

The craft went out of site as I rounded a corner, and, seeing as there were no other cars on the road, I immediately stopped, put the car into reverse and went back around 50 yards to see them again, my wife said I saw them too, orange right?,  I said, Yeah, but they're gone now, look.   The craft were not there and only about 10 seconds had passed.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171

It looked as if the object left in a sideways u-parabola, disappearing traveling to my right.  The travel of the aircraft lasted at a span of approximately 3 seconds.

Bluish light heading S before turning towards me. It stopped then moved like a moth in rapid random motions.((NUFORC Note:  Star?  PD));2017-03-26 00:58:00;3-5 minutes;Bluish light heading South before turning towards me. It stopped then moved like a moth in rapid random motions before disappearing From my back yard, with my dog, and I was looking West at 1:00am and saw a bluish light moving south, the light changed direction 90 degrees and began moving towards me.  At this point, I thought it was just a helicopter, because the light was quite a distance away, maybe 8-10 miles away.  The light stopped moving and just sat still for 30-45 seconds before it began moving quickly like a moth, back and forth and up and down in no particular pattern.  My dog started acting weird and rushed back to the door, so I went to let him in, and when I turned back, the light was gone completely. I did take a picture while it was sitting still, which I submitted with my report, but it appears as just a small light with no distinct features.  Once it started moving, I tried taking a video, but my camera could not focus because the movement was random and quick.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
