Watched 3 bright objects travel across night sky in triangle formation with no noise.;2000-05-30 20:05:00;10 minutes;Watched 3 bright objects travel across night sky in triangle formation with no noise. 3 bright orange/yellow lights moving across sky.  flying in a triangle formation. Varied speed at some points appeared to stop forward movement and hover.  Two of the lights stayed mostly in the same spot in the formation.  3rd light moved faster and slower, up and down, changing the formation several times but always remaining in a triangle.  Changed direction and faded away.  At one point one of the lights appeared to drop another light from it.  Initially moved northwest then turned more northly before fading away.  Were very close at the beginning, but never heard any engine noise.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171

MY BROTHER AND i WERE IN THE NORTH END OF THE PRESCOTT VALLEY, AROUND 9PM. WE WERE LOOKING TO THE SOUTHWEST. WE SAW A SERIES OF UNUSUALLY BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHTS. THEY APPEARED FROM LEFT TO RIGHT ONE AT A TIME. THE FIRST WOULD ILLUMINATE THEN ANOTHER WOULD COME ON SOME DISTANCE AWAY. ABOUT THE TIME THE NEXT ONE WOULD COME ON THE FIRST ONE WOULD GO OUT. THEY WERE SPACED AN EQUAL DISTANCE APART AND SEEMED TO MOVE ON A HORIZONTAL PLANE. THIS FIRST SIGHTING HAD 6 LIGHTS TOTAL.  THE SECOND SIGHTING HAD 4 LIGHTS IN AN ARC, WITH A CLOCKWISE ROTATION, AT AN ELEVATION GREATER THAN THE FIRST SIGHTING. THE FINAL SIGHTING HAD 8 LIGHTS ON A LINEAR PLANE AT AN ELEVATION BETWEEN THE FIRST SECOND SIGHTINGS. EACH LIGHT WOULD COME ON AND APPAER TO BE STATIONARY. THEY WERE SPACED AN EQUAL DISTANCE APART AND WERE ON FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
Round headlight appearing to be two crafts side by side, then veered toward the E.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));2016-07-27 21:30:00;10 minutes;intial sighting of round headlight appearing to be two crafts side by side, then veered toward the east slowly, with hot burning metal I live in Prescott Valley,Arizona about 9:30 Pm, on July 27, 2016, I was standing in my backyard looking towards the northwest it appeared to me as though there were two aircraft side by side but the sound of the engine was like the sound of a fan.  It veered more toward the east and slowly glided, as though it was descending  When I first saw it,  it looked like the headlight was very round like a flashlight then there was at least a thousand feet of what appeared to be very hot metal the length of the craft. I could hear the motor it sounded like a fan was on. It seemed to be descending towards the East. It was huge. It seemed as though it was 1,000 to 2,000 feet away from my subdivision, here in Granville. I thought at first, they were searching for something because of the round light and it was flying so very low, then I realized the engine sound was not of a helicopter OR a small airplane.

Formation of 6-10 lights flying Prescott Valley, AZ then suddenly dispersed and went separate ways.;2017-06-08 22:00:00;20 minutes;Formation of 6-10 lights flying Prescott Valley, AZ then suddenly dispersed and went separate ways. 6-10 small airplanes, flying from the south from Phoenix all in a straight line, hovered, then suddenly dispersed in all directions.  Prescott Airport workers report, Work at the airport and there were no special air operations scheduled for tonight.   Others report, When I first saw them, they looked like a stacked configuration seemed to take forever to get near, then they were more strung out some sort of night maneuvers I suppose, guess it was not an invasion I saw eight, maybe 10. Others reported, They were all hovering over a field across from my house.  They we're together the whole way then after a few min they all separated going different ways.  We counted 17 total. and It looked like they came from a field, flew around a little, and hovered over it, then left going different directions.   Multiple reports with multiple photos having been taken.  I have at least two.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
