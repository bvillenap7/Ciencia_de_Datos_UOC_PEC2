This unknown object my husbands car turn off.;2009-01-07 05:11:00;2 minutes;This unknown object my husbands car turn off. At 5:11 am Wednesday January 7th, 2009 in Prescott Valley, AZ I was taking my dogs out when suddenly my dog looked up in the sky and started to bark. I looked up to see what he was barking at, then I saw a blinking light moving faster then a jet approx. 5,000 ft high. I ran inside to get my camera, when I got back outside it was gone ar at least far enough to where I could not see it.

Three blinking lights (in order) hovering w/ a metal pinging sounds in the dark morning sky for 8-10 minutes before disappearing.;2016-12-14 05:35:00;8 minutes;Three blinking lights (in order) hovering w/ a metal pinging sounds in the dark morning sky for 8-10 minutes before disappearing. At 5:35 am on 12/14/16 while I was out with my dog in my back yard I noticed three blinking lights in order (left to right) just hovering about 45 degrees up in the dark southwest sky.  I noticed a quiet metal pinging sound, like a small hammer hitting metal, but there was no other sounds.  I ran inside to get my mother and she came out to look at the lights, we remained outside for about 5 minutes just watching the hovering lights.  We went back inside and I yelled for my teenage son to come look but by the time we returned outside the lights and sound were gone.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
Orange flashing light moving To the right over the sky/ One stationary orange light and orbiting metal shards;2020-05-03 20:00:00;30 minutes;Orange flashing light moving To the right over the sky/ One stationary orange light and orbiting metal shards The first sighting was about two weeks ago lights over the Chino area. what I thought was a plane was definitely not after I focused on it.The lights could’ve been anywhere in between Mingus and Chino. The light I saw and two other witnesses remained stationary for 10 secondsThen would disappear and reappear moving right towards Paulden and repeated to disappear and reappear until it finally faded over Paulden. We talked about what we saw and agreed it could’ve been an airplane a firework or something from the weather. Then what we saw last night was when I had to report.  We were looking into the sky because the moon and the stars were extremely bright last night so then we noticed a orange glowing planet like ball over Paulden something I thought I really didn’t notice before. Then we started talking about the lights we saw the previous weeks. And if you looked closely at the orange like planet it was like there was little twinkles orbiting it like almost s! omething electrical or metal if you really looked closely but they were small shards orbiting it.  Then those small shards finally faded and so did that planet or ball of light or whatever it is. Honestly I’ve been trying to give this my best scientific explanation and so has my dad. I wish I had magnification last night to see what was going around that orange light. Finally to give you some perspective of where I saw it from I live at the base of Mingus Mountain and look over the skies of Prescott Valley Prescott Chino and Paulden.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
