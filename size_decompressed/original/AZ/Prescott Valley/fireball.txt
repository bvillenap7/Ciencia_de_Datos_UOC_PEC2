At 8:00pm this evening, my wife and I were getting out of our car, on our way to dinner, when I noticed two strange lites in the sky. It was already quite dark out so they were very easy to see. They were heading strait for us coming from the northeast and heading southwest. They were moving quite slow, much slower than a small airplane and in a strange synchroniced formation. I would guess them to be between 5 and 10,000 ft. elevation. I continued to watch them for about four minutes while my wife went into the restaurant. They appeared to be flickering as if they were burning. I watched them till they were directly over head. By that time, a few people had past me woundering what I was doing and I told them I was watching some strange lites, they looked up and saw them also. The lites were about 5 times as bright as the north star and from where I stood, looked about 2ft apart. After watching them for a few minutes, I went into the restaurant and told my wife she should come back outside, that they were still there. By the time we got back outside, they had vanished. They had no colored lites and maded no sound. I'm a refrigeration and air conditioning tec and own a mobil food concession business as well. My wife teaches 6th grade and we have lived in the Prescott area for almost 4yrs. I've seen all different types of flares in my 44yrs, theese lites could not have been flare.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
Extremely bright glowing orange ball of light with some sort of dim object obove it, possibly a reflection on a larger surface;2005-09-25 19:15:00;approximately 2-3 minutes;Extremely bright glowing orange ball of light with some sort of dim object obove it, possibly a reflection on a larger surface Approximately 7:15pm, Sunday September 25th. The phone rang-- it was my wife, calling from work. As I often do while on the phone, I stepped outside as we talked. There was still a good amount of light from the sun, which had set behind Glassford Hill (my back yard faces west, directly toward the hill). I immediately saw the orange ball and knew what it was. I have seen perhaps 10 of these in the 3.5 years I’ve lived at this house. With most of my sightings, the objects have been moving in a roughly south to north path, but a few –including one dramatic sighting- have moved in a north-south direction. This time it was moving south to north.  This time the object was quite close, and very distinct, directly in front of me and clear. It was, again, a very bright orange glowing ball. There appeared to be something above it that the glow was reflecting on. As with another close sighting, when my wife and I both had a good amount of time to view one of these objects, I had the impression that the glow was on the underside of a larger object. This time, perhaps because there was more ambient light in the sky, this thing above the glow was more apparent. I almost got the impression that it might be a balloon with some sort of flare burning under it. (Is there any known weather balloon or anything that fits that description?) It appeared to be quite close (although it is admittedly difficult to judge distances on lights in the dark sky) it was completely silent.  I was quite excited and told my wife what was happening. When she put me on hold (oddly, to tell a customer at her work that I was watching a UFO), I started yelling out loudly that there was a UFO in the sky, hoping that one of the neighbors would look up. I’m sure I sounded like a nut, but I was hoping that some other people would see what I was seeing (I don’t know if anyone heard or looked up and saw it).  It was moving fairly quickly, and since the air was very still, it seems unlikely that this was a balloon or anything else floating in the wind. I ran inside and grabbed my camera. The object was still quite close but I was having a hard time getting the camera to focus on it in the dim light. I watched it for a little while longer and decided to try to take a picture again. This time it focused and I got the attached snapshot (see email). It was quite far away by now and appeared as just a small dot in the sky. In the picture the object looks blurred because, presumably, the shudder speed was long. The combination of the movement of the object and my hand shaking is what caused the object the be shaped that way (I am assuming this because it was round to my eye).  Also attached to the email is a PhotoShop sketch of what I saw, as the photo is so poor and doesn’t really illustrate my sighting.  I have another report from 12-28-2004 that I can send you, along with a similar photo, if you would like. Let me know. I hope you can look into this sighting tonight and let me know if there is any explanation for what I saw (and have seen many times here in Prescott Valley).

It was going up (or approaching from the distance) but then went down for about 30 seconds.   I thought maybe it was a flare, except that it was orange, not red.  Then it rose up (approached) again and stayed in one spot for a brief moment before moving in a north, northeastly direction.   It was moving slowly, and with the binoculars I could see what looked like a large flame/glowing ember, and above it a perfectly shaped dome, like the kind you put over a clock or figurine.  The dome was translucent, like a jelly fish looks, colorwise.   The object continured across the sky and i lost sight of it when my neighbors trees got in the way.  At one point red embers fell from it.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
2 orbs of fire that kept disappearing and reappearing;2007-08-15 16:00:00;30 minutes or so;2 orbs of fire that kept disappearing and reappearing I was driving down from my apartment complex (The Terraces at Glassford Hill) and as I was driving down the hill toward The Copper Hills Car Wash, I saw two orange balls of light above the mountains (toward Jerome).  Something about the way they were moving, the way they looked like a match-head flame (but in a perfect ball) caught my eye.   I pulled into the Copper Hills Car Wash parking lot (which was empty).  I got out of my car and watched as they first turned in a direction heading toward Phoenix (I-17), weaving in and out of each others' path, then (as if they knew I was watching them) they started heading toward me- toward the direction of downtown Prescott.  This was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the sun was still out, the sky was bright and completely cloudless, so I could see them perfectly.   They were nothing but balls of orange light, flickering and roiling in hue, two or three times bigger than a plane.  They moved at a moderate pace, weaving (when I say that I mean, they weren't flying in a straight line), and as they passed overhead, one vanished completely (like a flame going out), then the other did, then one reappeared, then the other reappeared, then they each vanished completely.   I stared hard at them, but there wasn't even an outline of them- completely vanished.   I was shaking, in complete disbelief at what I'd just seen.   This was August, I know, but the exact day I can't be sure of, but 2007.   I don't do drugs, have no mental illness, and was completely sober.

glowing ball of fire that changed shape;2020-07-28 06:15:00;40;glowing ball of fire that changed shape It was glowing like a orb and seemed to change shape from triangle to round.  Its altitude was as high as air liners fly.  It stood still in the sky for thirty minutes and the slowly went straight up and disappeared into the atmosphere.  My wife and I watched it and I alerted my neighbors who watched it too.  it was daylight out.  I took pictures on my phone.  I know it wasn't a plane or rocket, having worked for the Air force twenty years I knew the difference.  No exhaust like a plane or rocket.  Just a glowing mass with no contrail.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
It looked like hazy planet or sphere, at first glance I thought the sun was shinning off it, but this did not move.;2020-07-30 19:45:00;~15 minutes;It looked like hazy planet or sphere, at first glance I thought the sun was shinning off it, but this did not move. My wife & I take our dog out at sunset in our yard to enjoy the cool evening air almost every sunset in Prescott Valley, Az.  They are so beautiful here. I am an amateur astronomer who has been trying get my wife involved in my hobby with me, I have a 10” reflector telescope a 10x50 binoculars and 15x70 binoculars that I bought for her.  We make a game of who see’s the first star or planet and name it. This particular evening just after sunset from our GPS position of N 34° 40’ 19.56”, W 112° 17’ 24.00”, we were expecting to see Antares, Arcturus, Spica, moon, Jupiter & Saturn. I looked up and at approximately 50-55° azimuth and approximately 200° on the compass and saw a very unique, stationary, bright object that was not normal, it should not have been there. To me it appeared stationary, very bright whitish and seemed to have a orange reflection of the sun in it too, this is with my naked eye. I quickly pointed it out to my wife who immediately went into the house to get her binoculars and she was able to see the object with them. She said to her it looked like a glowing fireball orange in the center and yellowish on the outer edges and seemed to be spinning, pretty much what I saw only magnified. We watched for a few minutes, she with her 15x70 binoculars and me with just my eyes, it seemed to rise straight up growing fainter as it did so and eventually disappeared.  I did not look at my watch but know the approximate time due to always going out at this timeline. We were dumb founded, neither one of us has ever seen anything like it before.  My wife was convinced it was a UFO and talked about reporting it, I was not so eager, although I think it very possible we are not alone and UFO’s are a real possibility.  I did not want to come forward. I did not know it but my wife kept looking at the news online to see if anyone else had reported it, when she found someone else did report it to this website we decided to also report what we saw.;34.6392951219512;-112.303217073171
