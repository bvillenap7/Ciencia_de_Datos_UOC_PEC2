A dark flying object was hovering in the distance.  We drove on a highway and it remained in one place for 15minutes.  As we drive south on I19, we continued to observe it.  I took a photo on my phone.  It appears as a dark spot-not clear.  Wished I had a zoom lens. We saw it before the the 326 mile marker on highway 18.;31.7216;-110.0584
