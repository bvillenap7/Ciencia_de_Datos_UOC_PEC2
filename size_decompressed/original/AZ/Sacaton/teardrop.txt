Tearshape - flying with the bulb end first, smooth grey/white in color about 3 feet long.;2003-05-15 17:35:00;2-3 minutes;Tearshape - flying with the bulb end first, smooth grey/white in color about 3 feet long. Driving home from work about thirty yards in front of my vehicle a small teardrop shaped object flew from the east  over the road at a hieght of about 50 feet.  For a moment I thought it might be a plastic grocery bag being blown about by the wind, but the object flew over power wires adjecent to the paved road and then turned parallel to the road and traveled south about a mile down the the side of the road.  The object flew in front and just to the right of my vehicle at about 65 mph.  The object  veered to the southwest and continued to travel in a straight path.  I turned right onto another road and watched from the left vehicle window as the object faded from sight.;33.123;-111.7362
