Triangle shape UFO in Gila River Indian Reservation.;2015-01-27 06:00:00;30 minutes;Triangle shape UFO in Gila River Indian Reservation. We were outside playing soccer and we happen to look up and see a triangle shape figure in the sky it was spinning real fast and it was in the sky floating sideways and the lights were colorful and would go dim and then get real bright, it was up there for at least 30 mins and then disappeared.   While we seen this occurring, we looked down the street and people were looking at it.  About 10 or more people saw it maybe more. The so called UFO has been coming almost every week around that time, and it's always in plain view, some planes go by it but turn the other way.   It must be a space craft, because all the planes that go by it turn the other direction.;33.123;-111.7362
