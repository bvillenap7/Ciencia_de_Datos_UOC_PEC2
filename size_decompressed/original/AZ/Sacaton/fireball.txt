Bright green fireball and tail falling toward the ground.;2014-11-14 02:45:00;2-3 seconds;Bright green fireball and tail falling toward the ground. I witnessed a bright green fireball falling almost straight down, trailing a bright green trail while driving east on I-10 between Sacaton, AZ, and Casa Grande, AZ, at around 2:45 am.  It was a quick 1 or 2 second sight before it went behind a small mountain I was driving past. I work nights so I was fully awake and aware at the time. I would write it off as a spectacular green falling star except I had seen this same thing back in 2007.  In 2007, I was driving south on I-25 just south of the CO & NM state line when I witnessed the same event.  The only difference was that in 2007, the area was completely open ranch land with rolling hills.  As I approached the area I thought it had gone to ground, I witnessed a green glow in the pre-dawn sky.   After I got closer, I realized the bright green ball of light or fire was hovering around 30-40 ft above the ground.  It had a conical shape light extending from the green ball to the ground that reminded me of a street lamp shining on the ground.  I'm not positive, but I believe the cone shaped light was not green but white or yellow.  As I came over the last hill to where the green ball and cone light were, where I intended to try to photograph with my cell phone, it had disappeared. Unfortunately the green ball & tail I observed last night went down behind that small mountain so I did not see if it hovered as it did the previous time.  I do know that there were a few houses or small ranches in the area, as well as other traffic driving both directions on I-10 so there is a good chance someone else may have observed this event.;33.123;-111.7362
