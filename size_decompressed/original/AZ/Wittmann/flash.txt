Stayed in that location for approx 45 minutes then disappeared and a few minutes later was spotted farther west of my home. Could not identify any specific shape, from my location all I could make of it was a pulsing light. On occasion it would pulse extremely bright. When observed through binoculars it was as though I was looking at the spectrum of colors and they were brilliant and changing constantly.  The object was moving in all sorts of directions. At times it would rock back and forth and then figure eight patterns. It would drop straight down then shoot straight up. It would stop just as quick as it was moving. In both locations it was making same movements.  After it moved to the second location it slowly moved to the west until I could no longer see it with clarity. My background is as follows: I am 40 yrs old, retired Air Force now working as a computer technician. My wife also witnessed the object, her background is as follows: She is 40 yrs old, served 6 yrs in the Air Force from 1986 to 1992, has worked retail prior to and after Air Force. My neighbor also witnessed object, he is in construction and I've known him for 2 years.;33.7637;-112.6142
Bright light falls from sky;2002-10-28 21:30:00;60 SECONDS;Bright light falls from sky It was around 9:30 pm, I took my dog outside and while I was putting him on his chain I saw what I thought to be a falling star, but it was too big and it had a big bright firetrail behind it, not like any other I had ever seen in my life. It seemed to come straight down, it was a very bright object and the trail behind it was a yellowish, orange with multi colors. It looked like it was going to hit the ground, but then it flashed , like a camera flash, and then there was nothing, no sound, no smoke , nothing. I was stunned by what I had seen. There were no reports of anything falling from the sky on the news. I still wonder what it was.;33.7637;-112.6142
