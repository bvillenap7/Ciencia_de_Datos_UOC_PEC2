Ok I was in Wittmann AZ.At my grandmathers house and I was outside. I was looking to the northwest and saw a fast streak of fire light.  That light looked close to the earth.  Next I say a bright light that seemed to move through the trees and bushes. IT looked to head to the southeast.  The lights seemed to go low and then dured into a pale glow. Then it seemed to go out like a flash light with a low battery. Now that fast streak of fire light, it was in the shape of a line(not a strait line but a line) The shape of the craft was unseen. The sky was clear, the wind was low, It wasnt very cold out.  No fog, no mist. The only people around was my cousin sister and father. The only people that say the fast streak of fire light was me and my cousin. The others only saw the bright light moving to the southeast, and then go out like a flashlight with a low battery.;33.7637;-112.6142
