Craft observed while driving through the Az desert,missing time.;1982-06-15 00:00:00;5 minutes;Craft observed while driving through the Az desert,missing time. I was traveling on my motorcycle late at night.It was somewhere in the middle of the Arizona desert.  I saw this craft, with very bright white lights.  It was probably 60 feet above me,and it made about 6 almost on-a-track,circular patterns above me.I put my bike up on it's stand to sit and watch this.On about it's 5th or 6th pass,it hovered for two or three seconds,then in the blink of an eye,it was gone.When it was hovering over me,it made a very soft and low humming/swishing sound. I got back on the road to catch up,as I had been following my parents,we were all re-locating to New Mexico.When I caught up with them in the next town,they were just finishing their dinner.They wondered where I'd been,as an hour and a half had gone by.To me it felt like I had spent no more than 5 minutes stopped by the side of the road observing the craft.It's important to note that at the time,the speed limit on that Hiway(Hiway 10)was 55 miles per hour.After I observed the craft,I pushed my bike to 105 mph to catch up,assuming that I COULD catch up.

recorded a white light getting bigger, smaller, brighter, and dimmer moving throughout the  N-NE-S part of night sky;2004-09-23 04:23:00;1 hr. 28 mins. recorded;recorded a white light getting bigger, smaller, brighter, and dimmer moving throughout the  N-NE-S part of night sky I, ((name deleted))., was on a road trip from Arizona to visit my brother in New Mexico on Thursday, early morning, September 23, 2004, 04:23 a.m.  My two friends and I were traveling east bound on U.S. Highway 10.  We had just passed the exit northbound for Safford, Az. about 5 miles west of a small town called Bowie, Az.  I was sitting in the back seat behind my friend ((name #2 deleted)).  I started to gaze out the window as we all do on road trips, when i noticed a bright, white light in the north part of the sky.  At first I thought it was the North Star, but quickly realized that it wasn't because it was moving while getting brighter and bigger, then dim and smaller.  I quickly grabbed my camcorder and began filming.  The object, when i first saw it, was in the north part on the sky on the driver's side of the vehicle.  The object was moving side to side and getting bigger, then smaller, etc.  At 5:11 a.m., the object moved from the north side of the car to the south side of the car while traveling eastbound.  At 5 :19 a.m., the object moved back to the north side of the vehicle.  The sun was starting to rise for the day, and i kept recording until the sun completely rose, and I could no longer film the object.  It was 5:49 a.m when I was no longer able to record the object.    ** Will not send copy of sighting until contacted by investigator. **  ((name deleted))   (O)- -  the object passed the car w/ visible light and sound - this side - (O)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I   Car   I           1 I         I           1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - - - (O) ((NUFORC Note:  Designs made in text do not survive the transfer from an e-mail program to a database.
