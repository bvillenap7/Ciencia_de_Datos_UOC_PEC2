stationary bright object changing colors in sky over Az;2008-07-13 01:00:00;approx 1 hour;stationary bright object changing colors in sky over Az I couldn't sleep so I went outside to sit in our spa.  I'm sitting facing the west and there was this bright light that was stationary but to me it was flashing. There is alot of air traffic out here, so I thought it might be a plane coming in my direction.  But it never moved. I called my wife out to observe it and she said that flashing was actually changing colors(I'm color blind)from red to blue to white, we watched for about an hour and it just got smaller and smaller and then disappeared.  From where we are I'd say it was just a little bit north of west and maybe 15-20 degrees above horizon.  I 1st observed it about 12:30, it disappeared about 1:30am.  We did get out an old pair of binoculars, my wife said the red light was circling around whatever it is.  As I am writing this about1:42am, there is another object with same characteristics sw of us only it appears to be farther away.;32.9969;-111.3612

I saw 9 lights in a straight line then the lights went out one at a time then they moved to a different spot and the lights came back on.  These lights were like a greenish color, but then when I went to take a picture, they were gone in a flash. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time of the sighting, which believe was 6:40 p.m. (MDT).  PD));32.9969;-111.3612

New Year's Eve leaving from a friend's house who lives in a remote area in Florence Arizona notice the green light hovering in the sky;2019-12-31 22:20:00;2 minutes;New Year's Eve leaving from a friend's house who lives in a remote area in Florence, Arizona, notice the green light hovering in the sky while coming to stop sign driving home. Its is completely dark pitch black except our headlights so I thought it was a firework about to explode so me and wife wait and this single green ball or round pillish looking craft it starts to move slow back n forth n hovering for a min and then shot into the sky my wife and I both looked at each other mouths open as no plane or aircraft can move that fast.  I should add we both dont drink so there was no mistaking this for a firework it;32.9969;-111.3612
