There was a red flashing red light to the East, half way up into the sky.  It zig zagged in every direction quickly, sometimes stopping.  It would fade & then disappear, just to reappear again in seconds.  It just disappeared after about 15 minutes in the sky. Is there ANY explanation as to what it was?;33.7233;-111.6767
