Stationary flashing lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is former senior military.  PD));2012-08-19 04:00:00;1 hour;Stationary flashing lights Witnessed at 0400, 8/19/2012, from my location at Carefree Az. next to the Carefree Airport. Stationary flashing light, due east, seemed to be at 30,000 or higher.  Watched it for 1 hour using binoculars.   It remained constant and stationary and seemed to be a flashing light bar with a red light moving up and down.  I could see Orion’s Belt and this was 10’ south and 20’ East in the sky.  As the rotation caused the star’s sky position to move the object did not.   By 0500 the day’s light made it impossible to see anything further.  What I saw was not round but seemed a rectangular light bar, very bright and flashing with a red light moving along it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this individual, and we found him to be unusually eloquent, and unusually objective in his description of the object.  Witness is former senior military.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally capable witness, and reporter of fact.  Witness reports that the object did not move with the star field, as the Earth rotated to the east.
