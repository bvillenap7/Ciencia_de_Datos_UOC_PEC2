Blinking unexplained lights that tilt and move.;2020-01-31 19:56:00;2;Blinking unexplained lights that tilt and move. I witnessed these lights over a neighbors house. Not sure how far away they were. Once I saw them I went back into the house and got my phone. I started videoing the lights. I narrated the video. I caught other aircraft but they all had navigation lights. If you notice the angle of the lights change and I am in the same spot. There is a block fence in front of me that you can see at the bottom of the video. I have no idea what this is and MUFON said it was man made. Maybe but the explanation they gave was weak at best. I have over 40 years in aviation and I can't explain the lights.;32.7508;-111.6682
Blinking lights tha pull away and tilt.;2020-01-31 19:57:00;2:55;Blinking lights tha pull away and tilt. I witnessed two blinking lights several hundred yards away. I videoed them and watched them after I turned the video off and they tilted to to the right and pulled away. The lights were blinking in sequence alternating between right and left. A plane does not do this with it's light as they are either a rotating beacon or a strobe. Also notice there are no navigation lights (green and red). I mentioned this in the video. I could go on with details but MUFON already said they can't identify them but they are man made. I will be happy to send the letter they sent me.;32.7508;-111.6682
