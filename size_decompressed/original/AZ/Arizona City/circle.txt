DURING THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 2006, ON THREE CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS, I WITNESSED TWO BRIGHT ORANGE BALLS HOVERING IN THE SKY ABOVE ARIZONA;2005-12-01 20:00:00;20 minutes;DURING THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 2006, ON THREE CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS, I WITNESSED TWO BRIGHT ORANGE BALLS HOVERING IN THE SKY ABOVE ARIZONA CITY.  I STOPPED TO WATCH AND NOTED THAT ONE BALL WOULD JUMP OF MOVE SIDEWAYS THEN RETURN TO ORIGINAL POSITION .  THE OTHER BALL WOULD DO THE SAME, MOVING UP, DOWN OR SIDEWAYS AT GREAT SPEED, RETURNING TO ORIGINAL POSITION. AT TIME, THE BALLS WERE NEARLY TOUCHING AT OTHERS, SEEMED GREATLY APART AND INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER.   IN DRIVING TO MY HOME TO GET CAMERA, I KEPT THESE IN VIEW. NO SOUNDS, AURA'S OR BEAMS WERE OBSERVED. HOWEVER, BY TIME OF RETURNING FROM INSIDE HOME, BALLS WERE GONE.  THEY HAD BEEN VISABLE FROM MY FRONT YARD, AS I PARKED.  IN SPEAKING TO A LEAST 3 OTHER PEOPLE AT WORK, WITHOUT MUCH DETAIL, IE: I SAW SOMETHING KIND OF ODD LAST NIGHT IN THE SKY OVER ARIZONA CITY, ALL THREE HAD WITNESSED THE SAME THING, DESCRIBING THE BALLS AS I SAW THEM.  THERE WERE BETWEEN ARIZONA CITY AND TABLETOP MTN, NEAR MARICOPA.  ANY EXPLANATIONS WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is corrected to some date in December 2005, not 2006.

Big Orange orbs seen In Phoenix Az  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly flares over Gila Bend Firing Range.  PD));2007-02-06 20:30:00;10 min;Big Orange orbs seen In Phoenix Az Large orange orbs in a T formation In westly direction over the Tohono O'dhamn Nation.  Was reported on the news that similar lights were visible in Phoenix,Az. Was visible at nighttime.  Orbs hung in air for a few minutes and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Because of both the location, and nature, of the bright objects, we strongly suspect that the bright objects may have been aerial flares, launched from aircraft over the Barry M. Goldwater Firing Range, located near Gila Bend, AZ.  That is what official military sources apparently reported, shortly after the event had occurred, and we have no reason to doubt that claim.

Red to white flare that emitted a fog.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:00:00;5 minutes;Red to white &quotflare&quot that emitted a fog It looked like a normal flare from berry goldwater test range but instead of descending it was going higher/closer then slowly went from red to very bright white and emitted a circular cloud/fog after it disappeared it left a faint blue mark in the black night sky that is still visable from my point of view.
