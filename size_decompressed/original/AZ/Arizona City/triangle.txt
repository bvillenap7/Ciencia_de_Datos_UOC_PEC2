Triangle UFO with orange lights seen over Arizona City twice in one day.;2007-08-03 23:30:00;1 minute;Triangle UFO with orange lights seen over Arizona City twice in one day. My husband and I were outside smoking a cigarette around 11:30 p.m. and he was just telling me about seeing a UFO on the way to work that morning on Sunland Gin Road around 4 a.m., hovering over the crops riding right along side of him. As he was describing the triangular craft with 3 big orange lights when we actually saw it over in the distance! It was facing us, then rotated to its left, our right... So fast that the orange lights left trails going sideways. I was shocked! My husband told me it was definatley the same thing he saw riding ridiculously low to the crops on his way to work. He didn't know what it was. Now I've looked this up on the internet, and I did find a picture of the exact same lights, and the article that followed said these were flares being dropped from a plane. Well I think that is a bunch of B.S. because we actually saw the craft for one thing, and flares being dropped would leave trails going down not sideways. We don't know what this is, whether its some secret military aircraft they're testing out here in the middle of nowhere, or if its aliens but we definately saw it.;32.7508;-111.6682
