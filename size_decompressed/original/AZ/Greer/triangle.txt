I pulled into the turnoff to go to the town of Greer from Highway 260. There were three cars parked on the side of the road, all of them with people standing outside, looking into he sky. I wondered what they were looking at, so I looked in my rearview mirror and saw a red-orange light in the sky. I turned around and pulled over behind another car and asked them what they were looking at. They handed me a pair of binoculars and pointed to the same red-orange light. When I looked through the binoculars, there weree three red-orange light arranged in a triangle shape with the point downward. This object was directly to the north between the tops of some trees and moving to the east toward the Springerville Generating Station, but far enough away that it could not have been caused by the plant. We stood there watching the light for well over 30 minutes and it remained for more than an hour I know this because we kept looking for it. Finally, around 8:30 or so, the object went behind a large cloud and I lost track of it. That does not mean it dissapeared, it just means I had to leave. Based on the haze of the sky and power plant emmissions that I saw when looking through the binoculars and the lack of a coherent outline, I believe the object was a long way away.;34.0082;-109.4685
