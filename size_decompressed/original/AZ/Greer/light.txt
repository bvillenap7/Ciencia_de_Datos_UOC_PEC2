It was flashing very fast, from red to orange. I looked back and forth from the object to the road for approx. 15 mins, twice stopping to see if the object was moving. It wasn't. When I looked up at approx 21:05, the object had vanished. When driving home from a cclass in the town of Eagar, AZ, I looked up to see a very bright light, almost exactly the same brightness as Jupiter, which was somewhat nearby. I slowed down to look at the object, and I saw that it was flashing and not moving perceptibly. However, it may have been moving toward me and I would not have known. I repeated this twice, each time noting that the light never moved. In the space of approx. fifteen minutes, I glanced from the object to the road and back every fifteen seconds on average. At approx 21:05, I looked up and observed the object again. I glanced down at the road and approx. five seconds later, I looked up and the light was gone. I slowed the car again and looked out of the windows in every direction, but could not find it. The light was approx 30 degrees elevation, and, perceptibly, two inches, when holding my finger at arm's length, above a ridge approx. eight miles ahead of me. Thhe direction of the sighting was almost exactly east.;34.0082;-109.4685
