That's NOT the moon!;1977-05-22 20:00:00;60 min ??;That's NOT the moon! There had been a lightning storm, the power was out, but the storm was over. We saw the full moon rise from behind the mountain, and someone said Look at the moon It rose so fast we knew it was not the moon. It was a very bright orb in the sky. moving quickly toward us and dancing around in jerky movements. Two of us ran outside to see better. It came closer, was very bright and gave off shadows, but no noise. We stood there awhile, I don't know how long. There was a feeling of awe and peace, but after awhile it came really close. The color went from orangey to whitish blue. Next I remember, I heard our other friend who had stayed inside yelling come back come back and the light slowly withdrew. We went inside and told him it was all right. The thing withdrew and danced off into the distance, then moved erratically and went straight out away. The clock was stopped, all power still off, so we don't know how long this took. It was really wierd and has stayed with me all these years, but I'm not really sure of the date so the date and time are uncertain, only that it was in 1977 at Owl Head Ranch in the Tortilita Mountains of Arizona;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
Saw a silver shiny sphere twice while driving north on Cortaro before Silverbell in Marana, AZ.;2008-12-06 08:45:00;20 seconds;Saw a silver shiny sphere twice while driving north on Cortaro before Silverbell in Marana, AZ. I looked into the clear sky, looked north saw a silver shiny sphere for about 20 seconds and it disappeared and then reappeared and disappeared.   I was driving heading North on Cortaro 1/4 mile from Silverbell in Marana,AZ and noted the time at 8:45 am and searched for planes or balloons and saw no other crafts.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
Large, white lit obj. with 6 smaller red objs as well as 2 smaller white ones, stayed in same area 6 hrs at least.;2009-02-21 19:00:00;6  hours;Large, white lit object with 6 smaller red objects as well as 2 smaller white ones, stayed in same area 6 hours at least. My daughter and son went out to check the sky after hearing a report on FOX news of lights over Scottsdale, Az.  That is when they spotted a large round light in the northwest section of Tucson.  They called me and I drove 10 miles out into the desert to join them.  We had a wonderful view, as the area was dark and on a hill. The object was large, round and had a white light.  The light would very in color, from white to brilliant white.  It would also change from round to a horizontal oval shape. The appeared to be at least 6 objects that came from it.  These were smaller and reddish in color.  They would circle around and then go back to the main craft or light.  This happened several times. At least twice, a reddish light came from the object to the ground.  There were also two other white shears, but they appeared smaller.  At one point one of the smaller white one appeared to land and take off in a few minutes.  This continued for at least 6 hours. At one point a white light came from the object towards us.  At that point my daughter panicked and ran to the house.  At times there were light that went from the smaller red objects back to the large white one. On the bottom of the large object, there also appeared to be red, blue and green light. I have no doubt that I saw the same object to the southeast of the same location I was at, about two weeks ago.  It also stayed in the same spot for hours.  There was one other incident of one of the smaller red light much closer to the house, but my daughter is too afraid to talk to anyone about that. The objects could not be seen from the area of Marana I live in, which is right across the street from the City Hall, but could be easily seen from out in the desert slightly northeast of here.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
