I was driving North on Trico Road when I noticed the aircraft in the air. It was in the middle of a banking turn with one wing tip down and the other up. This gave me a good look @ it's top view profile or footprint. It was a solid black chevron shape. It's nose and wing tips came to points. After turning the craft descended dissapeared behind the trees, which obstructed my view of it actually touching the ground. I saw a Cessna @ about the same altitude about 10 minutes later and from comparing the sizes of the 2 craft I figure the UFO was about the size of the Stealth Bomber. I design packaging for flying toys. I have a lot of reference photos of our Stealth Bomber, and this was NOT a Stealth Bomber. As soon as I saw it, I knew I had to be looking @ the craft responsible for the famous Phoenix Lights incident because the shape was the same as the shape rendered and shown on local TV. The thing that sort of puts the icing on the cake, is that this aircraft landed @ Evergreen Air Center. This thing flew like a conventional aircraft. I had my windows up and was probably too far away to hear any noise anyway, so I didn't hear anything. I saw no lights, and I didn't see any cockpit or windows. As it leveled out on it's approach, I could see what had to be it's landing gear, but I couldn't make sense of what I was seeing. It didn't seem to make sense, it just didn't jive with what I know about retractable landing gear. The shape of it's profile seemed awkward, I tried to contact local news about it, but they just refered me to guy locally that didn't help or do anyting.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
