It came back and cirled the mountain about fifty times and then disappeared to the north.  Approximatly 15 minutes later it reappeared again circling the mountain.  I just sat in the back of my pickup pulled off of the freeway and drank a few beers while this thing kept buzzing around. Finally after an hour or so it shot straight up and then flew back into the cave.  I never saw it again.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
