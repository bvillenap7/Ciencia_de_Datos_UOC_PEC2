Triangular  low-altitude, slowly gliding, lighted object came over our home outside of Marana, AZ;2004-08-19 01:30:00;5 mins;Triangular  low-altitude, slowly gliding, lighted object came over our home outside of Marana, AZ I wish I had reported this when it happened, the time and date would be accurate....didn't think to report it til I saw a program on Discovery.   The night this happened, and I'm thinking it was mid to late August, 2004, I was sleeping in our rv because of remodeling our home and I woke to use the bathroom.  I noticed out the bedroom window a light not normally seen and kept watching it.  The light was yellowish almost like a street light.  It was coming from the n/nw at a very low altitude and a very slow rate of speed....gliding regally, would describe it. I watched as it came towards our rv this vehicle had to have been black as it did not reveal its triangular shape clearly til it was nearer the rv I was in. The light was round, flat, and, as I saw,  set into the bottom of the vehicle.   This light was steady, never moving or changing...quite big and seemed to be in the center of the vehicle's bottom.  The odd thing about this light is that you would have thought it would light up the ground, but it didn't.  I opened the window to listen, but there was no noise.  The vehicle came on and as it approached our rv to go over it, I could actually see the bottom of the vehicle, that's how low it was.  The bottom had the round light pretty much in the middle and molding around it but the molding was shaped in triangle form.  Sort of like if you drew a star and then drew a circle in the middle...I saw no other lights.  It kept going at that same regal pace over our rv and on into the night in a s/southwesterly dirction as far as I know.   I have a physical disability that prevents me from walking so I couldn't get to the other side of the room or go out to photograph this.  I wish I could have as I could have at least got a shot of the bottom of it. I probably wouldn't have bothered to report this, except I have seen two other unusual things in the sky lately, so mate said I might want to keep track.  There was also a program early in Sept of this year on the History Channel showing a sighting in Belgium that had been reported at some time, and I thought it was similar to what I'd seen.  Thank you for your patience and time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
