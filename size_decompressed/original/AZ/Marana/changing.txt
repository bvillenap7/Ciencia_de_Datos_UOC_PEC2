Orange lights appearing and disappearing around Marana;2012-10-30 20:30:00;>1 hour;Orange lights appearing and disappearing around Marana My husband saw orange lights appear and disappear as he traveled west on Ina road.  He picked me up and we got on I-10 to see if we could see them. I spotted them about 3 miles outside of Marana heading north.  We pulled off the road.  They had disappeared at that point.  We waited about 10 minutes and then they appeared again.  They appeared and disappeared one at a time. We do not know how many there were.  This lasted for probably 20 seconds or so. We waited again for about half an hour and they appeared again off in the distance.  They had moved quite a ways west but it is difficult to say how far.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
