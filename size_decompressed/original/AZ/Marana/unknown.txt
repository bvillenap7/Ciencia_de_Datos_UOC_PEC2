((HOAX??  Note dates.  PD))  1-3 objects seen North of Tucson;2006-12-21 11:00:00;1-2 minutes;1-3 objects seen North of Tucson I'm really not sure of what to make of this, but at around 11 this morning, i was driving home from school (Marana High School) on Twin Peaks Rd. just north of Tuscon.   My step-sister who was in the car noted the object(s?) first.  She told me to pull over for a minute, so i did. Looking up, I saw mabey as many as 3 objects about 4-5 thousand feet in the air.  I noticed another car and its occupants were pulled over looking at the same thing.  After about 2 minutes an air-force jet made an appearence and the objects simply dissapeared.  I don't quite know what to make of the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  Possible hoax.  PD));32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
