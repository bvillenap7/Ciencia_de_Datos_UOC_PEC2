3 Orange Orbs Over S Pinal County;2003-09-10 20:10:00;2 minutes;3 Orange Orbs Over S Pinal County I am ((age deleted--young)), a ((specialty deleted)) technician at Evergreen Air Center.  While that doesn't hardly justify me as a credible witness, I've been around aircraft all my life.  I work at an air station where we see everything from Cessnas to B757s.  It is my opinion that what I have seen is either not man-made or not conventionally identified per FAA regulations and as such should have been forced to land for their altitude was far greater than 500 feet.  So, to the incident...  I was talking to my mother outside while she watered plants in the front yard when I noticed a single orange light.  It didn't dawn on me that it was there until it instantly disappeared.  When I commented on it she turned around and suddenly 3 orange orbs appeared.  I could not gauge the distance except to say that we live 8 miles to the east of I-10 and these were hovering over the valley and north of Evergreen, where I work, which is 3 miles west of I-10.  As we watched they disappeared one by one.  I was tempted to get a camera, tried to get my father to see them but he was unavailable.  They disappeared after only 2 minutes.  I did not see any signs that they were man made aircraft.  They did not have strobe lights.  I heard no sound, but since I'm assuming they were at least 11 miles away I probably would not have heard a helicopter from that distance.  However, I have ruled out helicopters because if the lights had been spots, they did not go out gradually as if turning, and given the distance spots would not be focused 11 miles away, they would be focused downward, and finally why would 3 be focused in my direction.  Given the apparent distance and their apparent separation of 1 to 2 miles from each other, I would surmise that they would have to be purposely focusing on my house.  Not a likely prospect. Hence, they were not spots but simply bright lights.  But as the lights went out, I should have seen the strobes.  Also, the objects seemed to disappear in correlation with known man-made aircraft entering the same airspac! e.  Incidentally, it was a near full moon.  This was the first of two sightings, but I'll file a follow up for the second. ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated is approximate.  Please see other report.  PD));32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
More Orbs in Pinal AZ;2003-09-15 20:00:00;30 minutes;More Orbs in Pinal AZ I just submitted the first of these sightings, which occured on 9/10/03 at 20:10.  Again, I was in the front yard playing my guitar when my dog barked to the west.  There was no moon and the stars were shining brilliantly.  In the same location as before, approximately 3 miles west of I-10 and some 3-5000 feet high, were 4 orange orbs, hovering.  They would occassionally disappear and reappear in the same location.  This went on for about 10 minutes when the one on the far left (south) reappeared even further south.  The second one from the north did not reappear.  Eventually, and I'm not sure when, the one on the far south could no longer be seen.  I am not sure if it is due to obstruction or if it had disappeared.  I did get some pictures which are not developed yet, I will at my earliest convenience.  However, I was using an SLR and the film that was loaded.  At 400 and without a tripod at night, I can't imagine the photos turning out, but we'll see.  Anyway... I watched the two orange orbs for around 20 minutes while I took pictures.  At one point, it appeared as if there was a string of lights beneath the one remaining to the north.  The string appeared to be in parallel with my angle of view as they were extremely close together and slightly at an angle going from upper-right to lower-left.  I am guessing there were 4 or 5 in the string.  As in my previous post, they seemed to disappear when known man-made aircraft entered their airspace.  But when the aircraft left, they would reappear.  I ran out of film and turned my back on the lights to get my other camera, when I emerged the string was gone.  The single orb to the north was now very low on the horizon, lower than the mountains to the west so I know for sure they are closer.  I managed a few more photos using my truck as a resting point for the camera.  I also forgot to mention that at one point two of the orbs were very close together.  I'm still a little excited by this, but hopefully my pictures will help me piece the order! of things together.  Unfortunately I have no other witnesses to corroborate my story.  Suffice it to say, they were exactly the same in shape, size, brightness, and activity as the orbs of my previous post.  I am sorry that I do not have images right now, I am actually hoping that others have seen the same and can confirm what I have seen as either man-made or not.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
A dozen unknown lights form a trailing line and a wall of light in the face of fighter jets over Tucson, Arizona.;2005-09-10 20:00:00;45 Minutes;A dozen unknown lights form a trailing line and a wall of light in the face of fighter jets over Tucson, Arizona. The first time I saw them was the best. It was about 8:15 PM. My brother, his friend, and I were on our way back from a foothill we call Sawtooth out by the Silverbell mines. I was spacin' out, staring out the window. Directly where I was staring about 4 or 5 larger sized (about the size of 2 or 3 planes coming in to Tucson)yellowish orange lights appeared in the blank sky, and held a steady glow. They sat there for about 15 seconds with their lights on, then all went dark. At this point the 3 of us were standing out on the side of the road. So, about a minute or so later, a single light comes on. Then another up and off to the right of the first one lights up, then another in the same direction, and another. There ended up being I believe 5 lights at that time. By the 3rd light, the first was fading out simultaneously, and the rest followed suit. After a little of this type of action, different light patterns and #'s of lights, etc. they seemed to be playing or something, maybe just flying around observing. The thing about it was that now there were maybe twice as many lights and they didn't blink. They would sometimes shut off their lights, but never blink. Then, at about 8:45PM, the Marana Regional Airport sent 2 jets out. I heard them take off and watched them cross the sky. All the unidentified lights were now shut off. But once the jets were close, they all turned back on, and were very close together, shining toward the jets. There had to have been like 15 of them. It was like a wall of light in the sky. Eventually the jets arrived and chased about 4 of them toward 3 Points, and 2 or 3 toward Pheonix. The rest were gone. I've seen them do many different but similar things since then on maybe 7 different occasions, and have maybe a dozen other witnesses.

Orange lights in night sky.;2010-02-01 08:30:00;3 mins;Orange lights in night sky. Have seen this many times in the past 2 years.  Usually late at night.  Orange lights in a evenly spaced line that come on and then slowly fade out one at a time.  To then apear a moment later.  Sometimes in a position that can't be explained as an aircraft.  Also have seen at dusk in a clear sky where a plane would have been visible but only the lights were seen.  Also experienced a dark craft flying low that blocked out stars but could not see the craft.  It had no lights and felt like it was moving low and slow...could hear a humm..  Witnessed by other family members.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
A series of bright round orange lights appearing in 5-10 minute intervals high in the sky over Marana, AZ;2011-03-24 20:45:00;30 min;A series of bright round orange lights appearing in 5-10 minute intervals high in the sky over Marana, AZ At 20:45 from shopping center at Tangerine/Oracle Rd in Oro Valley, AZ I saw a series of orange round lights in far, far distance looking West. The shopping center is in a 'bowl' so the lights were high on the horizon, but from our position in the bowl, it was probably a 15 degree angle. Light appeared, lighting up one by one, stayed momentarily, then disappeared. Five minutes later lights returned, I told friend, who turned and saw them too. Lights disappeared. We stood and waited, they reappeared again, in a series of 2-3 round orange lights, one set of three lit up, then the other set which was near but not attached to the other set. At best from far away it looked like two different objects each with three lights, but this is an assumption, we didn't see object, only the lights. At 20:55pm we drove out along Tangerine Rd towards the adjacent town of Marana, we would see the lights on compass setting West. We continued to head West, taking the new Twin Peaks Rd from Tangerine down and over Interstate-10. Along this time we continued to see the series of lights intermittently. We could now tell they were not a plane nor helicopters, not a tower. (They were much higher in the horizon than a tower.) We lost track of them around the intersection of Coachline and Silverbell in Marana. When we lost site of them we felt as if the lights were still slightly West of here, but we felt we were in the immediate area. Lights were definitely high in the sky for us to see from so far away.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
Strange orange lights in the sky over Marana, Az.;2012-02-08 20:00:00;10 minutes;Strange orange lights in the sky over Marana, Az. At approximately 8 pm on Wed. Feb. 8, 2012, I was sitting in my backyard looking into the western horizon above Marana, Az.  I saw an orange light appear that appeared to be floating into the sky.  Immediately after the first light caught my eye, I noticed another appear.  Then it was two or three at a time lighting up until there were 20 of them.  They moved across the sky in a smooth manner fading in and out intermittently in a random pattern. I ran in the house to get my camera and when I returned the number of lights were down to about 10.  They were in a formation that appears to be stable with a light at rear that seemed to float a mile or so behind the others.  The lights were far in the distance but they seemed to span maybe a mile or so from the light at one end of the group to the cluster of them on the other end. When I originally saw them, I was describing them to my sister (on the phone) as looking like floating Chinese luminaria lanterns.  I was able to video the lights for a bit more than a minute, during which the light eventually faded out one by one until they were suddenly just gone.  Never going up into the sky, or down towards the ground.  They just vanished in mid flight. I have no explanations for what I saw. It was not plane(s), helicopters, or the like.  The entire time that I watched them was approximately 10 minutes.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
Hovering orange lights over Marana AZ.;2013-01-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;hovering orange lights over Marana AZ. Two bright orange lights from the same craft.  Lights appeared to be circling craft.  Two other lights flew up to first and disappeared.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
Bright white light dancing in the sky.;2014-09-06 04:30:00;60 minutes;Bright white light dancing in the sky I was outside walking my dog before I left to go camping on Mt. Lemmon.  It was about 4:30 in the morning and I stood there and watched it for about 5 minutes before I ran inside to get my camera.  I was expecting it to be gone when I cam back out but it wasn't.  It was still in the same area that it was in.  I placed my camera on top of a fence post to make sure my hands were not shaking.  I have 4 videos 1) 59 seconds, 2)15 seconds, 3) 13 seconds, 4) 8 seconds  The light danced and moved in ways that no human made object could move.  The movements were against, what we understand, as the laws of physics.;32.4136230769231;-111.233384615385
