Long skinny craft with many light within it flying over town. ((NUFORC Note:  Cluster of Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-11 19:00:00;2 minutes;long skinny craft with many light within it flying over town. not explainable with any worldly reference Driving home tonight about 5 miles south east of town and saw a line of strange lights traveling south bound maybe 1000-1500 feet off the ground and climbing at a slight angle. At first i thought it was multiple craft in a line, maybe helicopters or something. I had my binoculars in the front seat and quickly pulled over and turned off my car. When I looked at the lights in the binos I clearly saw that this was one large long skinny craft, making no sound what so ever. The lights in the craft were varying brightness and looked like lights within a ship. I watched in total shock for what seamed to be 60 or more seconds before the lights slowly dimmed and disappeared   as this craft thing headed south.  I'm out at night in the wilderness all the time, that's all we have out here is open spaces. Never in my life have i ever seen anything like this. No explanation, sure would like some answers. believe 100% this was something significant and not of this world. I don't feel comfortable talking about this. people will think I'm crazy but it was there.;34.1083;-109.2953
