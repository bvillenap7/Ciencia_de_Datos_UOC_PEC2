Multiple Lights Appear in the Morning Sky, Persist For At Least 40 Minutes;2005-09-29 06:10:00;50 minutes;Multiple Lights Appear in the Morning Sky, Persist For At Least 40 Minutes I noticed the light at approximately 6:10 a.m.  This time of year, it is still night time.  The sky was clear and stars were clearly visible.  I noticed a bright, golden light in the sky.  The light did not blink.  It appeared at first to be a quickly moving satellite or other object moving in a linear fashion from the East Northeast to the South Southwest.  It was travelling at a relatively high rate of speed for its apparent height and traveled across approximately 66% across the sky when it stopped.  The light remained stationary for a period of a few minutes when another light, smaller and bright white appeared to make a short hook out of the golden light and streak off at an extremely high rate of speed to the Southwest. After a short time, the golden light appeared to travel in a dithering mode which appeared to vary the location of the light in both altitude and orientation.  Following about five minutes, the smaller bright light, or another which resembled it, sped apparently close to the golden light.  The golden light gave short quick chase and the smaller bright light disappeared.  I kept expecting that the golden light would leave the area, as the dawn began to brighten the sky considerably.  However, the golden light persisted until approximately 6:50 a.m. MDT, when clouds advanced and obscured view of the golden light.;35.6426;-109.0939
