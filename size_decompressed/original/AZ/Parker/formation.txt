((NUFORC Note:  Possible NOSS satellites.  PD))  Clear night moving triangle formation across night sky, followed by flashing lights.;2005-07-12 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;clear night moving triangle formation across night sky, followed by flashing lights I was outside, looking at the Moon, and other stars. I went to put my Telescope away, but decided to see, if there was anything else to see. As I was looking up towards the north, I happened to look at the Milky Way. All of a sudden, I saw one moving object, then all of a sudden there were three, total. They were in a triangle formation. It was very strange to me I even got goose bumps all over. As I looked further north, there was a flash not once, but a few more times. Formation was heading south from me. Later I lokked to the north, approx. 1 to 2 hours later, and saw the flashes again. We have airplanes go around us all the time. We are in a flight plan, west-east, and back. Flashes were not airplanes. Yes, I do believe, that we are not the only beings, as such. There is other life. I feel it. I was only one of how many humans, get to see what I saw.

We do not know what the purpose of the satellites is.  PD));34.1546;-114.283
