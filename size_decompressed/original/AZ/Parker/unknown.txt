Looked like in the shape of ball, my husband said it looked like, there were sides on them. They were coming from the NW, heading E, but then the first one started to turn N, then it dis-appeared, then the other one came up, and turned in the same direction, then it dis-appeared. We live in an area, which has water, and alot mtns. I have seen, the satellites go over us all the time. What we saw, was no airplane, or sats. When we walked around the corner, and back to our house, there were 3 people standing out in front of their house. They asked if we saw the orange lights. We said yes. I said that was weird' I have seen strange lights here before. I believe that there is, another life or lives beyond us. Seeing what we all saw, is very real.;34.1546;-114.283
