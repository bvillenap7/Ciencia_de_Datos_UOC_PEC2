Nephew & 2 friends blowing fire crackers along river bank apparently scared an alien out of thickets. Described alien as bright orange w/large dark eyes. Started to chase them on foot so they ran, stopped and threw some fire crackers at it which made it run back into thickets. Bright light beamed over them at this point,they continued to run home.  All 3 went to nephews home (closest) when they arrived a bright light went on over the house.  Other sitings have been witnessed in this particular area but I've never heard of an actual alien on the ground.  What could be the reason for it to be described as bright orange?;34.1546;-114.283
Large bright orb near the Colorado River;2014-02-13 19:07:00;3 minutes;Large bright orb near the Colorado River On Feb. 13, 2014, at 7:07 PM, I stepped into the doorway of our 5th wheel and noticed a very bright object off to the north.   At first I thought that it was a planet.  I then realized that there was a light cloud layer behind it and it was getting closer.  It was very large and bright.   Its distance was about 1/2 mile and several thousand feet in elevation.  I called my wife and we both observed it for about an additional minute until it accelerated off to the north east and disappeared.;34.1546;-114.283
Bright light on ground that changed size and then flew.;2015-12-10 08:00:00;8 hours;Bright light on ground that changed size and then flew. In Arizona desert.  No persons within miles.  Awoke to bright object like reflecting sun rays seemingly stationary resting on a rock shelf several hundred feet away.  Looked about 1 foot in size then began to move along ground.  Then began to rise vertically.  As it did it became larger and had shades of green.   Into flight about 1 mile away, then disappeared.  Saw it later on the ground moving around in different locations.;34.1546;-114.283
Two orange lights with one white light between them;2016-03-01 19:00:00;45 seconds;Two orange lights with one white light between them Back in January or February you told George Noory on Coast about the sighting of the two orange lights with one white light in the middle that took off from the ground out by Wellton, AZ.  I saw the same thing two orange lights with one white light in the middle along with the white Parker lights while I was camping east of town off of Shea Road.  But instead of taking off from the ground these lights were up in the sky and to the left of the common white lights.  I asked around but no one in town knows what those lights are and I looked on the internet but only found one article.  One lady that works at the Indian gas station told me that she has seen them since she was a little girl and she is 21 now.;34.1546;-114.283
