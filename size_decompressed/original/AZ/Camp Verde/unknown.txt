Fast moving bright lights that split and disappeared;2000-09-24 06:15:00;2-3 Seconds;Fast moving bright lights that split and disappeared Sunrise had not happened yet, but it was light enough to see around the area and the blue color of the sky.  It was light enough so no stars were visible.  I was looking to the north about 30 degrees above the horizon and a very white bright sharp light caught my eye.  It was moving from NW to NE and gaining altitude.  It was moving at a rate of speed that I estimate to be 7-10 times faster than any airplane that I know of.  It traveled for 2-3 seconds, split into 3 bright lights one above the other.  The center light was not as bright as the other two.  As soon as the it split, it appeared tocome to a complete stop.  The light split into three seperate lights and disappeared.  There was no contrails, smoke trails or debris of any sort during flight or when it disappeared.  There was no shape detected as it was only the bright light during travel and the three light just prior to disappearing.  The sky was clear at the time with no clouds or aircraft in the area. Both my wife and I saw it traveling through the sky, but she turned to look at me in disbelief for a second and didn't see it split into three lights and disappear.  When she looked back, it was gone.  Both my wife and I spend a total of 33 years in alw enforcment and she now owns her own business and I am a computer network manager.;34.5724;-111.8554
as a crop circle in the sky;2003-02-22 22:00:00;1 hour;as a crop circle in the sky while walking the dog at approx 2200 hours, I noticed what appeared to be a huge wheel rotating over our RV.  The object was very big and was rotating.  It almost appeared to be a like a crop circle in the sky.  I went and got my wife, she came out and also observed the lights. The outer circle was rotating, while the inner bands were sort of streaming onto one to the other.  This area is extremely dark at night, no street lights and not enough lights from the small town to reflect and or cause any dimness in the night sky. I have no explanation for what was observed.;34.5724;-111.8554
Brilliant white sputtering oval nodding side to side around 800' above highway.;2013-10-29 22:00:00;2 minutes;brilliant white sputtering oval nodding side to side around 800' above highway It a shuddering brilliant jagged edge white light. It was hovering over the highway mostly in the middle of nowhere around 800 feet up slightly quavering from side to side.  It had a little bit of an irregular red tinge inside the white hot major luminosity.   I got that 'it wasn't 'right' feeling about it and checked my watch- it was 10:08 pm.   I seriously thought of needing to 'get past' it without being abducted and 'losing time'.   Yes I was curious and briefly considered pulling over but sought to excersize caution and not be involved with it. I still just have the one scoop mark I always had.;34.5724;-111.8554
