We just had a storm and there is a great deal of cloud cover.  I found this strange since since this was below the cloud coverage.  It was circular with one light to the left two lights in the middle and one on the right.  It was as if I was looking at the bottom of the craft.   I watched this craft for 40 minutes.  This craft was huge.   I have been seeing a great increase in crafts over Mingus Mountain and have calls from other neighbors and friends of what they are seeing as well.   I have been watching this activity for years.  With this particular craft it has been by far the largest one I have seen. What this craft did was move up and down and just hover there.   There is no way possible that no one else could have missed this since there is a freeway there.  It was extremely low and stayed there for a long time.

Round black object in the sky by Camp Verde, AZ with no sound, just hovering.;2016-04-28 00:00:00;2 minutes;Round black object in the sky by Camp Verde, AZ, with no sound, just hovering. Pulling unto Highway 17 South from highway 260 I saw a very black object in the sky that was sort of round and toward the bottom was a little bit thinner.  It looked to be low in the sky and I could not tell the size but it did not move.   We were late for a doctor's appointment, so I could not pull over to keep watching it.   I would estimate that it might have been about the size of a small plane.  There was no sound.;34.5724;-111.8554
