Shiny Silver football shape, seen for only a half second.;2005-11-10 13:30:00;0.5 second;Shiny Silver football shape, seen for only a half second. I was driving north on I-17 in AZ.  It was mid day and while I was driving I got a glimpse of a Football object about 375 feet off the ground, maybe 3 miles ahead of me.  The object was, according to me about 4 football fields long, and maybe .75 football fields tall. I was driving and when I saw it, I said to my partner, Did you see that?  And my partner replied, No, what did you see?  at that time, like I said I was on the I-17 and someone was passing on my left side, I noticed in their vehicle that the driver was reacting the same way I was.  The drive was pointing and interacting to the passenger.  I then pointed to them and said to my passenger, Look, they saw it, their pointing to where the object was.  On all the ufo shows I've seen, I haven't seen any that showed one as huge as the one I saw.   Because of this sight, I do believe in dimension.  Because I did not see the object zip away.  It just vanished and for an object that huge that was the only thing it could do.  Have you ever looked at a video and put it in slow motion, you will see the regular house hold lights dimming and illuminating at a rate (60 HZ).  The human eye doesn't register that, but that day I do believe I saw a glimpse of frequency that I wasn't suppose to see.
