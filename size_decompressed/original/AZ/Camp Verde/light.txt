Multiple lights, moving horizontally and vertically with no sound.;2016-07-21 20:00:00;8-15 minutes;Multiple lights, moving horizontally and vertically with no sound. It was approximately 8 pm as I was returning to my house from walking my dog, when I noticed a yellow and red light hovering in the sky.  It then move straight up and down without making a sound.   Then the lights doubled, there were now 4 lights, 2 yellow and 2 red.  They were at the same altitude.  Seemed like they were connected somehow because they moved left to right then hovered.  Then shot straight up, stopped, hovered again then descended down as if it were landing.  I went got my girlfriend and she saw it after it had became 4 lights.  Again it made no sound and it moved to quickly vertically and horizontally to be a plan or helicopter.  We live 35 minutes from Sedona and our skies are usually clear, so plans and helicopters can be easily identified and heard.  The object may have landed.;34.5724;-111.8554
