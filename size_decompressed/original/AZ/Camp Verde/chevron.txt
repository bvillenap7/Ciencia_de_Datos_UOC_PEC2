Earlier in the day, about 14:00, we noticed numerous streaks across the sky similar see when the military test fires missiles.  A short time later the sky was completely covered with chemtrails.  The sky was completely clear when suddenly odd looking clouds began to cover the entire sky.  Part of the sky looked as though an atomic bomb had gone off.  My wife and I were sitting in the backyard.   We live atop a large hill with views of Sedona to the left and old salt mines facing us.  We suddenly saw 1, than 3 than 6 total gleaming chevron shaped objects.  I am a former Navy pilot and have never seen a military aircraft or formation like this.  They kept grouping in a circle then rapidly gathered closely together only to spread out again repeatedly.  This lasted about an hour than they simply disappeared at the same time in a flash.  The weird clouds than the UFO's left us feeling very unsettled. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights??  PD));34.5724;-111.8554
