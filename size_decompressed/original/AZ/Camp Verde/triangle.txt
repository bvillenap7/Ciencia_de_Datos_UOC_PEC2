At approximately 9:00 PM on the evening of 07/10/2004, I walked outside in our front yard, and saw a bright, star-colored light, in a triangle shape, moving quickly and smoothly, with no sound whatsoever, across the night sky. It was moving from a southeast direction (from the direction of Phoenix) towards a northwest direction (towards Sedona and Cottonwood). It was about the size of a pencil eraser when held at arm's length. Jets seen at this distance make an audible noise, this object made no noise whatsoever. I watched as it moved away from me, getting smaller and smaller, until it finally was no longer visible. It seemed to be moving towards California. I live 5 miles out of town (Camp Verde) on Hwy 260, and this took place in my front yard. Not the first stange object I have seen from out here, and most likely will not be the last.;34.5724;-111.8554
