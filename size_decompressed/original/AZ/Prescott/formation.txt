These were individual craft flying in a distinct formation-- absolutely not flares.;1997-03-13 18:00:00;3 mins. approx.;These were individual craft flying in a distinct formation-- absolutely not flares. I'm writing regarding the well documented Phoenix Lights. I saw them from the base of Granite Mountain in Prescott, AZ., which is approximately 100 miles North of Phoenix. It was still light when I saw them traveling in a Southerly direction. The most important point I want to make is that they were absolutely not flares, as some would later claim. I come from a family of pilots and have my flight ratings as well. These craft seemed to be moving faster than most planes I have observed. They were traveling in a very symetrical formation-- like an elongated triangle, with probably three lights on either side of a single light at the point. They simply looked like round white lights to me. They seemed more luminescent than typical jets made no sound left no contrails contained no other plane-like lights and again, seemed to be traveling very fast. I have wondered if they might be some new secret military craft, but couldn't understand why they would fly over a highly populated area like Phoenix-- wouldn't make sense. This would also have placed them on Sky Harbor's (Phoenix's international airport's) radar as well. Anyway, I don't know what they were, but they sure as hell weren't flares. I will always consider them as having been individual craft unlike anything I had previously seen. I wish so much I would have had a video camera. I know others reported seeing these lights at least as far North as I did. I just hope that my report will lend support to the idea that they were not flares. That was one of the most obsured conclusions I have heard. Hope this can be of some help to you.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
v formation white lights to start with at long range as it got closer looking through binoculars each light was actually 2 one red one ;1997-03-13 20:12:00;5 min;Summary : v formation white lights to start with at long range as it got closer looking through binoculars each light was actually 2 one red one green 4 on one side 3 on the other like missing man formation moving very slow and making no noise at all. At around 8:15 on 03/13/97 four of us observed a v shaped object coming at us with bright lights. As it got closer we got out some binoculars and looked at it, what looked like white lights were actually two lights forming one. One light being green the other one was red. During this time the oddest thing about this, was there was no noise at all. There was no moon to backlight this so we could only see the lights. I thought perhaps because there was no noise that it might have been a pedal plane that I saw on the discovery channel once. It appeared to be about 1000 feet in the air. One observer is a principal at a local gradeschool, another telephone man, one dental asst., and a 14 year old.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Observed five yellow-white lights travelling from NW to NE then turning to S;1997-03-13 20:15:00;10 min;Summary : Observed five yellow-white lights travelling from NW to NE then turning to S While doing astrophotography I observed five yellow-white lights in a V formation moving slowly from the northwest, across the sky to the northeast, then turn almost due south and continue until out of sight.  The point of the V was in the direction of movement. The first three lights were in a fairly tight V while two of the lights were further back along the lines of the V's legs. During the NW-NE transit one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position.  I estimated the three ight V to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Chevron formation of five white lights, plus other strange things.;1997-03-13 20:15:00;5 Minutes +;Chevron formation of five white lights, plus other strange things. As I write this, it is almost seven years since the events described actually happened.  They left such a deep and disturbing impression that I still think about them from time to time, as I have never heard an adequate explanation.  I discovered this website while searching for something, anything that might have come to light in the intervening years, and felt compelled to add my account, as it includes some additional items that I haven’t seen reported by anyone else.  On the evening of March 13, 1997 I was camping just outside of Prescott, AZ, in the forest near Hidden Valley Dr.  There was a campsite nearby that was closed for the season, but my tent was outside of the campground area, on a hill I would estimate to be about a half-mile from Highway 89.  Just after 8:00 PM, I noticed several lights in the sky off to the West-Northwest.  I assumed at first that they were airplane lights, as they seemed to be the usual colors of red, green, and white, but they seemed to be moving somewhat erratically (hovering and bobbing in the air), and I got the impression there was something generally weird about them.  The colored light they were casting seemed to project in much stronger beams than I have ever seen from an airplane, and they seemed to be rotating and changing colors from a common source, rather than the clearly separate lights that airplanes have.  I recall that there were two of these objects, but there may have been more that I dismissed as airplanes before noticing the oddness of the lights.  At around this same time, I saw first two, then three lights off in the trees to the Southwest.  At first I had thought they were the eyes of an animal, God only knows how I could have thought that, but then I noticed the third light, and also noticed that they seemed to be pulsating, growing dimmer and brighter by turns.  These lights appeared to be very low to the ground, somewhere amongst the trees and evidently some distance away.  As all this was going on, and I was getting generally freaked out, while I was looking in the direction of the red/green/white lights, I saw a chevron formation of five very bright white lights appear out of the West-Northwest sky.  This formation banked towards the South, and flew directly overhead.  I was observing this from just inside the tent, with the opening facing Northwest (I was already pretty badly frightened by this point, and had gotten into the tent for security), so I lost sight of them after they passed overhead.  I cannot really make a decent guess as to their altitude, or how fast they were moving--from the time I saw them to the time they passed overhead was less than half a minute, so I had the impression they were moving pretty fast, and at the time (having seen them from a great distance off) I assumed they were at high altitude, but descending as I watched.  My impression was that they were five separate objects, although they remained in perfect formation when they performed the banking maneuver.  I believe these particular lights passed over at around 8:15.  They made absolutely no sound.  This brief sighting of five lights flying in a V was my only glimpse of what is now called the Phoenix Lights.  For several hours, however, I continued to observe a number of strange things in the sky, including the red/green/white lights, several lights that I would have thought were stars if they had not been moving in jerks and starts in random directions, and at one point what appeared to be a circle of orange light (pretty much the color of fire) passing through the sky from East to West, also without any sound.  I was so exhausted that night that I eventually fell asleep despite all the bizarre things in the sky.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Saw 5 bright lights in triangle formation in the northand heading southeast at an extremely fast speed.;1997-03-13 21:00:00;30 seconds;Summary : Saw 5 bright lights in triangle formation in the northand heading southeast at an extremely fast speed. Here's what I saw.  I was taking the dogs out before bed (I'mnot exactly sure what the time was, around 2100 I think)and I looked to the north and saw 5 very bright white lightsin a triangle (or V) formation moving really fast southeast.Then they broke formation.  The light in the back and below(from my angle) slowed up.  Now I started to wonder what I waslooking at because most planes would keep formation or at leastbreak formation completely.  Never saw a plane with lights asbright as these also.  The group seemed to rotate 90 degrees tothe left and go a little south of Mingus mountain.  I was suprisedthat I couldn't hear them so I listened harder.  I did hear thesound of a faint rustling in the sky, not like a jet, but of somethinmoving extremely fast through the air.  The sound was a ways behindthem also and did seem to follow them.  I then started lookingaround at two other planes flying.  Sessna's by the sound andspeed of them.  Also by the red flashing lights.  I saw the lights fadeinto the distance and I headed back inside.  My first notion was whathas our government got up there?  New stealth technology?  Then whythe lights?  I also thought the lack of sound could have been some formof some top secret frequency cancellation system that the governmentis checking out.  But still, why the lights?It didn't hit home that these could possibly be UFO's until I heardpeople talking about it on Friday.  Then I knew I had seen somethingthat was definately unexplainable.  At least by me.It was definately not the comet, flair, balloon, or any other thing ofthat nature.Anyway, feel free to call if you want more information;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Triangle of lights moving in the upper atmosphere;2001-08-18 22:50:00;3 minutes;Triangle of lights moving in the upper atmosphere We watched a perfect triangle of three lights pass from west to east directly over us at the twelve o'clock position.  We then watched as the lead light sped up and dissapeared, followed shortly by the right-rear light, and then the left-rear light.  I am an instrument rated pilot with hundreds of hours of flight time in civilian and military aircraft and I have never seen a display like this.  The objects were at the altitude where satellites are normally seen, but were moving much more slowly.  There was no moon out at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Several similar reports for the evening on this date.  We suspect the objects may be the three satellites that have been reported to NUFORC on many occasions, and which we believe are part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system.

Large cluster of black baloons tehered together at 1500 ft heading SW;2002-10-12 18:00:00;10 minutes;Large cluster of black baloons tehered together at 1500 ft heading SW Cluster of very large black ballons? At about 1500 ft over the city of Prescott. They were tethered together so that they seperated up to the lengths of their tethers as the wind blew them toward the south west toward Wickenburg. The cluster was the size of a good sized private aircraft. As I vserved them through my binoculars the looked to be several feet in diameter, maybe 5-7 ft, entirely black. There was no instrumentation dangling from them, as would be from weather baloons. They could be a menace to air travel as they reach higher altitudes and maybe even become larger,;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
String of &quotstars&quot travelling East at 0605 in Prescott, AZ.  (Sstarlink satellites??));2021-02-12 06:05:00;3 minutes;String of &quotstars&quot travelling East at 0605 in Prescott, AZ. At 0605 local time in Prescott, Arizona I was driving to work on Willow Lake road when I noticed what looked like a normal star constellation, but it was in a straight line (not exactly straight) and consisted of many “stars”.  I am familiar with the night sky and was struck by a new, large constellation.  I stopped for a better look and saw what appeared to be over 20 points of light that were the similar size/shape of the star Vega (I just picked a star, no other significance) that were travelling West to East in unison.  They were not in an exact straight line but looked more like a long string of lights being towed behind an aircraft.  There was no sound that I could hear, and the lights were steady, not blinking.  They were somewhat randomly spaced so did not look like a coordinated formation, except that they were all traveling the same speed and direction (same velocity) and never changed their spacing relative to each other, which is why I mentioned them being towed.  Their speed and path were constant as long as I could observe them.  They were lost at the Eastern horizon where they went out of sight naturally.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
