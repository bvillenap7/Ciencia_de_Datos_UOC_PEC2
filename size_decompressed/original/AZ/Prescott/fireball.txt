Three orange-yellow lights flashed in a straight line in the sky, blinking on and off once before blinking out of view entirely.;2003-12-10 19:25:00;10 seconds;Three orange-yellow lights flashed in a straight line in the sky, blinking on and off once before blinking out of view entirely. We (that is, my brother and I) were driving down the highway between Wickenberg and Prescott. The sun had set, and the dusk was gradually fading into night. The hills and mountains were shrouded in black and the horizon glowed a bright pink bordered by a dull yellow. We were in the middle of the desert, mind you. At some point on the highway, my brother asked me if you can see shooting stars more clearly in the desert.  I don't think it's quite dark enough for that, I said.  At that moment, three orange-yellow lights flashed into view in the sky over Prescott. At first I thought it was an airplane, but I realized that couldn't be the case: the lights were arranged in a staight line of three fireballs, and the one on the far right blinked out, and the middle one followed it and blinked out as well, leaving only one light in the sky. A split second later, however, the middle one flashed back into sight and then the far right as well. The three fireballs shone brightly they were round and fat and cast a constant glow, meaning they didn't glimmer or glitter at all. Except for when they blinked, their luster didn't oscillate at all: no glimmering, shimmering, glistening, glittering, gleaming or other such pretty verbs. After some 7 seconds or so, all of them blinked out one by one--from the right to the left. They vanished into thin air and didn't return.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Fireballs seen in TN, TX and AZ at the same time.;2005-03-26 17:00:00;seconds;Fireballs seen in TN, TX and AZ at the same time. Oddly enough, my girlfriends and I were on a 3 way call. We were all 3 outside at the time because our families were sleeping.At the same time (aprox) we all sighted one large fireball travel from west to east across the sky. I'm bad with directions...but I think this is about right. This was followed by two or three smaller fireballs. The really weird part is we reside in different parts of the country. One in Tennessee, One in Texas, and myself in Arizona. Almost at the same time we all excalimed something along the lines of Holy Shit!! We all went in our houses and checked the news channels. I checked Nasa, Astronomy.com, SETI, and called Homeland Security who directed me to file a report with you. The first was a giant fireball! I thought a plane had crashed...or something to that effect. There are obvious explanations for what we all saw...but I wanted to report my findings just in case whatever srashed had lifeforms inside that may be in need of rescue. I probably sound like a lunatic..but at least I've done my part.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Small fire ball looking disk orange/red;2013-04-27 00:00:00;1;Small fire ball looking disk orange / red Lasting approx 1 hour small red and orange disk flying in a line across the tree line.  Some would move upward then fall back into formation.  There was 50-100 objects during the hour duration.  6 witnesses all watched this, they was not meteoroids or gas pockets, nor did they seem to be air crafts due to no flashing or blinking lights.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Silent, single bright orange orb heading east over Prescott, AZ, 7-10,000 ft above at a high rate of speed.;2013-06-30 22:30:00;30 seconds;Silent, Single bright orange orb heading east over Prescott, AZ, 7-10,000 ft above at a high rate of speed Father and I were in jacuuzi when we both spotted a solid bright orange orb, in the background, much higher up was an airplane in usual flight pattern.  Object was first spotted over Granite Mountain(where the latest Doce Fire took place) heading east at a high rate of speed.  It passed through the clouds, directly over us. Not a usual flight pattern even for the drone testing performed here.  Watched the object keep its continuous, high rate of speed for nearly 30 seconds.  Object was silent and rather large(30-100ft), estimated 7,000ft-10,000ft above.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Unidentified object object obscures radio.;2014-01-19 20:15:00;5-10 seconds;Unidentified object object obscures radio. A spear like object flew over head, paused and jetted in another direction.  About the size of a planet in he night sky, no notable color besides a blue-ish tint.   Upon sight, as I watched- my radio malfunctioned and began to sound off loud clanging, screeching, a consistent hum with knocking noises and the sound metal pans being rubbed together.  Then it was gone, the sound stopped. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone on two occasions with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
A red fire-ball shot across, low in the sky and then disappeared instantly.;2014-06-22 20:30:00;10 seconds;A red fire-ball shot across, low in the sky and then disappeared instantly. Very large and clear, low in the sky, but too high to be fireworks, too low and quiet to be a plane.  Too low to have been a falling star.   Glowing, red fire ball shot across the sky and then faded out instantly. ((NUFORC Note:  We confirmed with the witness that the sighting was in the evening, and we have amended the time to reflect that fact.  PD));34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Blue/white ball of light falling toward Earth, and same color arrow shaped light which lit up in front of/below it.;2014-12-06 00:22:00;3 seconds;Blue/white ball of light falling toward Earth, and same color arrow shaped light which lit up in front of/below it. I have not done this before, do not think this was a UFO, wasn't sure who to report to. Driving up into Diamond Valley, AZ, facing hills in background.  Bluish/white, bright, round ball of light appeared x 2 seconds and slight arch as it fell toward the earth then below it/projected from it, appeared an arrow shaped bluish-white light (like ball) which pointed toward/fell straight toward Earth (an elongated outline of exit sign is the closest to arrow I can describe in shape) then arrow gone in a second too (the ball disappeared after arrow appeared below it, then arrow disappeared).  It is very cloud covered (happened about an hour ago) so it is possible I did not see the fall of this light all the way from high in the sky it seemed to appear suddenly not far above the hills just above the clouds, fall out of the clouds, produce the arrow, then ball/arrow disappeared before they contacted earth (I think).  Also, when I got out of car to look more at sky (did not see anymore lights) cloud covering over sky formed a huge perfectly round circle around the moon/the moon's light (the clouds were absent in this area...a natural event, but wanted to be thorough in everything I reported).  I have lived in AZ a long time, have seen lots of lights, all have had reasonable explanations.  However, I have NEVER seen anything like this.  I have considered that the arrow could have been some kind of reflection off the clouds from the original ball of light (I am a skeptic in all things and must have evidence), but the ball of light and arrow emerged from the clouds.  The entire thing lasted 3-4 seconds max.  Very odd.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Green yellow blue all of fire streaks across sky;2018-05-08 23:00:00;5 seconds;Green yellow blue all of fire streaks across sky I’m a 24 year old Male, with two college degrees. One in hard science, one in architecture. I have had sightings before but I like to think it’s because I pay close attention to the sky at all times. Last night - the night of May 8th, 2018, I was at a friends house. I was standing in the backyard and happened to be looking in the sky, slightly to the SW (looking in the direction of Thumb Butte for those of you who know the area) and all of a sudden a fiery ball of light that pulsed between green and yellow light frequencies streamed through the sky at high speeds.  It lasted for only about 5 seconds.  Right when it entered our field of sight, the 4 dogs that live on the property started freaking out.   This was not a meteorite.  I have seen multiple and many meteorites at varying distances in our atmosphere, and this was not one. It was too low and not fast enough and the color was not that of a meteor burning up.   Only one other person in the backyard saw it with me.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
