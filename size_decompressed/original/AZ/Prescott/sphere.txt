It was mid-late December and my family and I were on our way to Ensenada, Mexico for Christmas. We had decided drive pass Flagstaff and take a road that passed through Prescott. The road was filled with curves that we thought would never end. As we approached the bottom of the mountain road I had noticed a white ball or sphere objects that had a trail following behind it. The object was not high enough to be an airplane plus it was bright white with a trail following behind. I knew that the oject was not a falling star because we have seen many of thoughs after living on the plains for 3 years. I had brought this object to my wifes attention so that I could prove to myself that I was not seeing things. My wife did see it and then I proceeded to pull the car over so that we could focus a little bit better on the object. I took my eyes off of the object and focused on pulling the car over, after I had stopped and looked up to locate the object it was gone. I had posted this short story on my web page and I did not come across your page until today and I thought that I would share this with you.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
It moved about a mile or less out into the desert and stoped, then I could see the ground light up beneath it for a moment and then it;2003-06-24 21:45:00;2min;I am a college student and I was up studying when I went out to the parking lot to get a book from my car. I was starting back inside when I looked up at the sky and I saw a very dim light in a circular shape. My dorm is near an airport but this object was far too big to be an aircraft, and there was no sound. It just seemed to hover there for a probably about 30 to 45 seconds. Then it started to move, slowly at first then faster. It moved about a mile or less out into the desert and stoped, then I could see the ground light up beneath it for a moment and then it moved slowly off into the distance and disapeared.  I stood there dumbfounded for several minutes after that before I returned inside.  This thing was very low, maybe 100 feet, and as far as I could tell it was about the size of a large truck. It was about 100 yards away from me when I saw it.  I have not told anyone of this, I din't think that anyone would beleive me.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
