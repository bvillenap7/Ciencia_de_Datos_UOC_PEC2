Phoenix Lights-like formation seen south of Prescott, Arizona;2006-11-13 18:40:00;20 seconds;Phoenix Lights-like formation seen south of Prescott, Arizona Date: Monday, November 13, 2006 Time: 6:40 pm Location: South Prescott, Az area Highway 71 -- 10 miles north of Highway 60 intersection Sighting direction: In front of me -- southwest  As I was driving southward from Prescott, Az. (on Highway 71), an unusually bright single light appeared 50 degrees up from my line of sight, near the top of a cluster of clouds. As it became the total focus of my attention, another light of the same type appeared at its right hand side, and then another, and then finally a fourth, creating a perfect straight line. The four lights were the exact same size, same distance from each other (each void space was equivalent to 5 diameters of one light), and had a delay time of two seconds between new illuminations, and moved in unison, as though attached to each other.  At this time, my mind flashed back to images of the Phoenix Lights witnessed a couple years ago. This grouping looked the suspiciously the same.  The lights did not illuminate in an instant on fashion. They came into view more like high pressure gas lights -- it was a sudden, almost gaseous, burst of light that took a half second or so to evolve to a 100% brightness. The plane of these lights was diagonally tilted with the left hand side lower, and slowly dipped into the clouds as I drove toward it. Because of the cloud's interference, I couldn't determine if there was second side suggesting a shaped outline, a la the Phoenix Lights.  I figured the only way I was going to see the configuration as a whole was to race past the cloud bank and hope it would still be there. I misjudged. After driving for several minutes, I realized that the clouds were much farther away than I had estimated. The bar of lights eventually moved completely behind them and disappeared. In retrospect, I should have stopped and exited my vehicle for observation.  The cloud bank distance made me consider how huge these lights must have been for they seemed so large at my viewing distance. Each was several hundred times larger in diameter than the brightest star in the sky. Though much distant commercial flight activity could be seen, there appeared to be no military aircraft in the vicinity.  Was it a craft? Were they military flares? Who knows. But it was nice to have witnessed such a well known Arizona-style configuration as my first sighting...;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Odd erratic, bright light over Prescott area.;2016-10-15 18:03:00;2 minutes;Odd erratic, bright light over Prescott area. A strange bright light just before sunset hovering over the Northwest territory beyond the city of Prescott.  It was moving erratically and then just drifted farther west and faded out completely.  What was strange is that it was so brightly lit up, but it wasn't night time, so it looked out of place and then the way it moved was odd.  There was a short trail in the sky near where the light faded out.  Maybe a helicopter?;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
