About 8:15 PM Sunday, June 8, 2008 I was driving north on Highway 89 in Prescott, AZ, along Watson Lake and I noticed a craft flying south about 30 to 50 feet above me and 50 to 100 feet to my right.  All my windows were down and so I know it made no sound.  It was dull dark gray and black, shaped like a triangle, much thicker in the center, even though the wing was also thick, with 2 or 3 dim colored lights along the edge (that I was able to see) and appeared very large as it was so close to me.  It probably was at least 20 to 30 feet across. I saw it, from the right-hand upper corner of my windshield, just as it was passing me so I only saw it for a few seconds.  I was unable to pull off the road for about 1/3 mile and when I did it was gone. This is my first sighting and I am educator with a Masters in Education.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
