The object appeared to be hovering in the south part of the Prescott, AZ valley. The object I saw was roughly 2 miles away and around 3000 feet high. When I first saw the object I was standing on a porch outside my grand parents house so I had enough time to rush inside after a minute of amazement and grab some binoculars that were hung on the wall beside the entrance facing east. My close up look revealed that I could clearly see the craft from all sides because although it was fixed at one point in the air it spun around counter clockwise at around 20 RPM showing off all sides of the craft. The color of the craft was tarnished silver metallic and it was weirdly shaped like a cut precious stone or like a diamond kind of slanted in a 45-degree angle. I say weirdly shaped because its design did not signify any form of conventional aerodynamics. It literally looked like a rock that should have fallen out of the sky. It appeared to be the size of a small prop aircraft or it may have covered almost a nickel I think. I did not see it fly off it was simply gone after witnessing itâ€™s presence for at least 15 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source elects to remain anonymous.
