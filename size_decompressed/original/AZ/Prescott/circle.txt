Bright yellow-orange circular objects flying in a V formation directly overhead heading NNE.;2000-02-04 20:30:00;2 min.;Bright yellow-orange circular objects flying in a V formation directly overhead heading NNE. I and my client were standing outside of the house looking up at the stars when the three objects flew overhead heading NNE.  They were extremely bright and didn't appear to be like any aircraft I have ever seen before.  There was no sound as they flew by, and I could hear night insects chirping.  No sound emenated from the objects whatsoever. I also could not hear any commercial aircraft nearby, and only saw plane lights in the distance.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881

Strange light makes 90 degree turn.;2016-05-10 22:00:00;6 minutes;Strange light makes 90 degree turn. I was up in Prescott on a camping trip. I was looking up at the stars and saw a few passenger planes. I noticed something that seemed much higher than the aircraft I was seeing.  I had to strain my eyes to see it. I thought maybe it was a meteor or something.  I pointed it out to my gfs sister and we just watched it moving slowly across the sky.  Then it made a 90degree turn and we were both confused.  I knew it wasn't a commet at that point.  I watched it for another minute then it dissappear.  Not sure where it went.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Procession of white round objects, lasting about 30 min. moving at uniform speed without sound.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-17 20:00:00;30 minutes;Procession of white round objects, lasting about 30 min. moving at uniform speed without sound. White round objects traveling ENE more or less in a line, though some were out to side. Around 100. Uniform speed, seemed to be very high up.  No sound.  Definitely not airplanes as there were a few planes with usual red/green lights.  We called neighbors who came out and were able to see at least two from their position.  We thought the procession stopped, but after a break it started again adding some more to the first 100 or so.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
