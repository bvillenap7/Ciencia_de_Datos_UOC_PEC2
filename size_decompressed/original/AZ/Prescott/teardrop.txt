We both agreed that the what we saw appeared to be an aircraft falling (but not streaking), very low in the sky.  It was in a dark southern sky, falling toward the west .  It seemed to be a small airplane or helicopter with fire flaming from the rear of the craft.  We thought it would fall on the outskirts of the city.   To me, it seemed to wobble slightly before disappearing behind a hill.  The flames were bluish-green with flashes of red.  We waited, stunned, for a few seconds expecting to hear sounds of impact or an explosion.  Neither happened.  The last time I witnessed a meteor was on the Deshutes River in Oregon.  It was a huge red fire ball which we believed would fall on us, but instead it flashed overhead and disappeared almost instantly.   A few minutes later we heard a huge explosion.  We later read an item in the newspaper stating that a meteor had exploded over the Willamette Valley and had disturbed some people.  The Deschutes River is on the east side of the Cascades more than 100 miles from the Willamette Valley.  What we saw was not reported in the Prescott or Phoenix newspapers, nor did it get reported on TV.  I remain worried that what we saw was a small aircraft going down, which has not been reported.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
