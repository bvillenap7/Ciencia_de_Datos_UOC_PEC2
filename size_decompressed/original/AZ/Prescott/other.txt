strange cloud plumes over the northern desert sky;2002-03-15 18:00:00;6hrs.;((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  PD)) strange cloud plumes over the northern desert sky On our way to Laughlin, NV, while driving north on hwy 89, we noticed a hugh spiral cork-screw shaped cloud a long way to the west.  For the next 2 hours, the cloud-like shape took on many different configurations, until it slowly dissippated.  It was very high in the sky, and the colors displayed changed from dark red to purple to blue! It looked like the plume of smoke which spiraled from the space shuttle Challenger!;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881

I was waiting for friends in an alley off Goodwin St. in Prescott, AZ, between City Hall and an art gallery, where I was going to help them set up for a weekly lecture series.  I looked into the western sky where the sun had already set, and to the south of Thumb Butte, hovering stationary over the ridgeline, was the strange object.  I wrote the following journal entry less than half an hour later:  At 1813 I spotted a hovering object in the western sky.  It pretty much remained stationary, but turned end upon end and rotated.  The object looked like six balloons tethered to a central point [here I made a drawing in my journal].  There were no lights on the object.  I could see no line tethering it to the ground, and it behaved as though it were free from any external restraints.  I watched it until 1829 and it moved practically imperceptibly, except for its rotating and tumbling.  It's now too dark to see it at 1856.  My friends arrived several minutes after I caught sight of the object and I beckoned them over to see what I was looking at.  They saw it, but were unimpressed and nonplussed.  I continued to watch it, as noted above, until 1829 when it was almost too dark to see. I subsequently discovered that there had been a rash of sighting over the previous few days to the south of Prescott in the Valley. The object was six-lobed, like a child's jack, and the lobes were in constant motion around its center, giving it a tumbling effect.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
