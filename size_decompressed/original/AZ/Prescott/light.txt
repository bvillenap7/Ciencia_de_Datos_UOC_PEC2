Orange lights;1999-10-14 08:30:00;45 min;Orange lights MYself and My friend were at a location in the forest when we saw a bright orange light appear a long distance out in the sky. It faded in. Then another light appeared to the left of the first and moved a little further to the left to put a distance from the first object. About five minute later the second light that appeared faded out. Then the first light faded out. Probably five to ten minutes later the light came back in the same location as it was the first time. Then shortly after the second light appeared in the same spot. Then I noticed a third light far to the right which I can not say if it was there for a while or not. Then in sequence probably ten to fifteen minutes later all three faded out in sequence from left to right. With probably a two to three minute delay between them.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Erratic starlike  objects dancing in the sky;2001-08-17 21:15:00;3min+;Erratic starlike  objects dancing in the sky First seen on 8/16 as a single item. It was a reddish yellow and was brighter than all other stars,but the same size.The reason it caught my attn.was it's erratic movement...bounced downward to the left and back to the right then to the side and back. Around 21:45 it began to move toward the south.When I saw it,itwas in the western sky at ou 25-35 degrees and later moved slwly and somewhat spastically to the southern .. at the same approx altitude. Last night the same appeared along with two others...SSW and SW...behaving exactly the same way  These observations were made from my bedroom which was dark and also from  our rear deck.Interference from city light is minimal.My wife also witnessed these events.I will be checking again tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the report is not inconsistent with a sighting of Mars, but that explanation would not account for the movement of the object over 3 minutes' time, as asserted by the witness.  However, the object was in that portion of the sky in which Mars would be seen, and inexperienced observers frequently report that a stationary celestial body was seen by them to be moving.

Three lights in western sky over northern AZ;2004-09-20 19:00:00;<1 minute;Three lights in western sky over northern AZ While travelling Westbound on Hwy 89 into Prescott AZ and just passing the Gateway Mall (on top of a hill) I saw three very bright lights in the western sky approx. 3 thumbs (arm's length) above the horizon just over a large mountain (Thumb's Butte).  I am a former military policeman and though the items seemed like flares, I just watched News Channel 5 in Phoenix and they showed the videos of exactly what I saw.  I know this occurred exactly at 1900 hrs because I looked at my watch and then timed the disappearance of each light from the right to left (north to south) until they were gone.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Bright orange hued lights that pulsed, faded, disappeared, reappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible celestial bodies??  PD));2004-10-14 19:37:00;2 hours;Bright orange hued lights that pulsed, faded, disappeared, reappeared in different locations and danced with quick movements. From our vantage point, we could see everything from the NW to the SE for as far as the eye could see, on a perfectly clear night with absolutely no overcast and a new moon.  The first object was a single orange light, straight west from the lookout.  It just appeared,midway in the sky, stayed for 10 to 15 seconds, very bright (the brightest light in the sky) and then quickly dimmed and vanished.  It reappeared maybe 10 seconds later in the same spot only to once again dim and vanish.  We then noticed a trio of orange lights to the SSW of our location, lower to the horizon, and watched them for maybe 2 minutes until they too just disappeared.  That group of 3 lights reappeared  further to the east of where it previously was, and remained in the same formation for a few more minutes until a 4th light appeared.  It was then that the first light we saw straight to the west reappeared.  Both groups of lights remained visible for several more minutes until the westward light dimmed and vanished, and the group of 4 vanished a minute after that.  The light to the west reappeared after a few minutes, followed a minute later by the group of lights, now 3 again in the same original formation... one light with another directly above it and another above and to the right of that one.  The single light vanished after a few minutes, and the trio a minute after that.  That was the last to be seen of the single westward light.  The group to the SW reappeared, in the same formation while 2 more lights appeared slightly eastward of those.  These 2 groups of lights acted exactly like the first... the westward light(s) would dim and vanish and the SW group would vanish soon after. All of these lights would pulse with brightness, and would have periods of solid brightness.  They all vanished and did not return, but now a single light would appear from the south and slowly grow brighter and slightly gain in elevation.  At the closest point (still too far to be determined), you could see colors of red, blue and green pulsating around the main white w/orange  light.  The colors could be seen with the naked eye, and confimed all that much more with binoculars.  That object would vanish and reappear several times, and even sped west to east quickly but shortly, sped back to the west and even at one time danced... very quickly speeding in an abstract pattern only to vanish again.  This all took place over a course of 2 1/2 hours, beginning at 8:00pm. and when we left at 10:30, the time between sightings was getting longer.  A curious thing... when the lights would vanish, we would see lights from passing aircraft pass by the area within a half minute, and the lights would reappear when the aircraft was gone.  All in all, it was an incredible sight to watch. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that celestial bodies would have to be ruled out as a possible cause of the sighting, before we could conclude that the witness observed genuine UFO's.

Unusual, silent, pulsating, red light, travelling slowly, then stopping and finally disappearing suddenly.;2007-08-30 22:15:00;10 minutes;Unusual, silent, pulsating, red light, travelling slowly, then stopping and finally disappearing suddenly. On August 8, 2007, at about 22:15, two people observed an unusual light over Prescott,  Arizona.  It appeared as a round, red light traveling NNE at what seemed like normal, small aircraft speed but making no noise. The intensity of the light varied but didn’t completely disappear. After continuing on it’s original course for 3-4 minutes it appeared to stop and then drift lazily to the left and right continuing to pulsate in brightness.  This continued for 5-6 minutes before it suddenly disappeared completely.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
UFO sighted over Prescott, Ariona;2009-09-26 05:00:00;20 seconds;UFO sighted over Prescott, Ariona At about 5:00 A.M. in the morning or 16:00 military time, my girlfriend and I were outside looking at the morning sunrise.  As I was peering onto a constellation I like to call the wolf, I noticed in the corner of my eye a moving light. This light at first seemed too slow to be anything possibly alien, but moved 10x the speed of an aircraft and did not blink.  Immediately I alerted my girlfriend and we both watched it for atleast 20 seconds move steadil across the sky until it disapeared. It was a dot moving across the sky.  I have done investigation into satellites visible in Arizona at this time of year, but to no avail have found nothing. I am left to the conclusion this was indeed a UFO, if it not for the impressive speed and lack of aircraft lights I would not think so. ((NUFORC Note:  0500 hrs is 0500 hrs.  I have changed the time above.  ISS not visible from Prescott at the time, and on the date, indicated by the witness.  PD));34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Sequential Orange Lights in Prescott, AZ.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible contrails, illuminated by the setting sun?  PD));2010-06-22 22:00:00;30 minutes;Sequential Orange Lights in Prescott, AZ. On June 22, 2010, at around 10 o'clock at night, my girlfriend and I both witnessed 4 events in Prescott, Az.   We had hiked up to the big P on the hill by town.  We saw various sequences of lights in the sky looking west.  The lights would appear for a short time, they all had an orange color to them.  They would light in sequential order in a straight line about 1.5 seconds apart, their glow overlapping each other to where 2 or 3 would be lit at a time.   We saw them in one part of the sky, then they moved perhaps 20 degrees over, then appeared again in a central location.  They were above the horizon.  Were these military flares of some sort???

Green light/sphere seen in Prescott/Prescott Valley;2011-12-31 22:00:00;5 seconds;Green light/sphere seen in Prescott/Prescott Valley At approximately 22:00 hours a green sphere/light was seen moving horizontal south to north.  The light/sphere appreared randomly and moved across the sky only to disappear behind some clouds.  The color was green similar to that of a stoplight.  We were outside looking towards Prescott Valley from Diamond Valley when this occured.  Light/sphere moved in a perfectly horizontal line and did not blink or make any other movements.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Three UFO sightings in AZ within a week.  All lights.  I'd never seen one before!;2014-10-12 05:00:00;30 seconds;Three UFO sightings in AZ within a week.  All lights.  I'd never seen one before! A week ago, I think on Sunday, Oct. 5, I was doing yoga on a wooden platform in my yard in Prescott, AZ, in the mid to late afternoon.  I saw a white pinpoint of light move erratically around the sky.  It was moving so fast that I assumed it was a laser or other natural phenomenon.  I watched it for 1 - 2 minutes while I was in shivanansa pose (on my back) before it disappeared.  I didn’t think much about it. Yesterday, October 11, my partner and I were at a campground in Cornville, AZ (near Sedona).  We had a good, clear view of the sky and were lying on our backs watching the stars sometime between 7:00 and 9:30.  We both saw what looked like a bright star in the sky (she saw it first), except that it was swinging back and forth by what looked like an inch or two, like an ornament on a tree, like it was tethered there.  Sometimes it would lurch a short ways forwards or backwards, but stayed in essentially the same spot on the sky for the 20 or 15 minutes we looked at it.  My partner thought she saw a faint dark circle outline around it.  I thought it looked more triangular.  The moving light was all we could see for sure.  Several planes tracked through the sky at the same time, but this was definitely not a plane. The next day, October 12, at about 5:00 pm, we were at the mall parking lot in Prescott, AZ and a guy in a Jeep was pointing to the sky out his window.  I looked up (my partner was driving), and I saw a light than seemed large and fairly close.  I thought it was a plane at first, but then (within 30 seconds) it quickly faded into the distance and disappeared, faster than any plane I’d seen.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Triangular/Chevron of three white lights flew extremely fast East over ERAU in Prescott, AZ;2014-12-01 20:37:00;2-3 seconds;Triangular/Chevron of three white lights flew extremely fast East over ERAU in Prescott, AZ As I was driving on the west-most side of the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Prescott campus, I saw light in my peripheral vision and quickly looked up to my left out the driver's side window.  I saw a strange grouping of three soft white lights moving at a VERY high speed flying east straight overhead over the campus.  The strangest thing was that I hadn't heard any roar of engines or a sonic boom from the speed.   I called an associate, who I knew was out walking nearby, to ask if he'd heard or seen anything, and he denied that he had.  It didn't look like any of our planes, and I called the flight supervisor ~21:06 to ask about any planes on the radar, and he said they hadn't tracked anything.  The grouping of the lights suggested either a chevron shape, or a formation that was very precisely close at such a high speed.  I will assume it was rather close to the ground, as I only saw it for a few seconds before it was gone over the dorms, and the lights were roughly the size of a child's size fast food drink lid held at arm's length, to my perception. (That's all I have nearby to compare it to, don't judge.)  I couldn't see any outline past the lights, only the haze of the low clouds fuzzing out the lights a good deal.  They moved uniformly for as long as I saw them, giving me the impression it was a single craft.  As this is an aeronautical school, there were at least several student pilots within a few miles, but the flight supervisor said no-one else had reported anything.   I'm a healthy 22-year old male, with no alcohol in my system. and no history of seeing UFOs nor hallucinating.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
